  Case Number:  19PSCV00397    Hearing Date:   December 6, 2023    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
Plaintiff Mark Liu’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED with
prejudice. 
 
Background   
 
Plaintiff Mark Liu (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows: On or about March
2019, Plaintiff and Defendant Xuefan Liu (“X. Liu”) entered into an oral
contract, wherein Defendant X. Liu agreed to wire funds that Plaintiff provided
to Defendant to an account at JP Morgan Chase Bank, but Defendant failed to do
so. 
 
On May 20, 2019, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint, asserting
causes of action against X. Liu, Shi Qiang Zhang (“S. Zhang”), Lina Zhang (“L.
Zhang”) and Does 1-10 for:
 
1.     Breach of Contract
2.     Fraud
3.     Conversion
4.     Common Counts (i.e., Money Had and
Received)
 
On November 9, 2019, X. Liu’s and S. Zhang’s defaults were entered. On
July 23, 2020, Plaintiff dismissed L. Zhang, without prejudice.
 
On July 23, 2020, Plaintiff dismissed Defendant L. Zhang. Thus,
remaining defendants are X. Liu and S. Zhang. 
 
On September 1, 2020, the court denied without prejudice Plaintiff’s
application for default judgment. 
 
On March 15, 2022, Plaintiff re-filed its application for default
judgment, which the court again denied. 
 
On March 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed its third application for entry of
default judgment, which the court on 9/13/23 denied. 
On November 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed a supplemental declaration. 
 
Discussion
 
On multiple occasions, the court has
noted that there are no allegations as to S. Zhang. In its supplemental
declaration, Plaintiff argues that this court is confused. (Supp. Motion., p.
2: 9-10 [“Is that the confusion?”].)
 
This court is not confused. 
 
The mere fact that S. Zhang is a named
defendant does not render the FAC well pled, which is a necessary
condition for purposes of a default judgment. (Kim v. Westmoore Partners,
Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 272-286.)
 
Turning to the 2nd
COA for fraud and 3rd COA for Conversion, while S. Zhang is a named
Defendant, the COAs
are not well-pled. It is well-established that fraud must be pleaded
with specificity. People ex rel.
Harris v. Rizzo, 214 Cal. App. 4th 921, 154 Cal. Rptr. 3d 443 (2d Dist. 2013); Blickman
Turkus, LP v. MF Downtown Sunnyvale, LLC, 162 Cal. App. 4th 858, 76 Cal. Rptr.
3d 325 (6th Dist. 2008); Philipson
& Simon v. Gulsvig, 154 Cal. App. 4th 347, 64 Cal. Rptr. 3d 504 (4th Dist.
2007),
as modified on denial of reh'g, (Aug. 29, 2007). In particular, fraud
allegations must be pled with more detail than other causes of action.(Apollo Capital
Fund, LLC v. Roth Capital Partners, LLC, 158 Cal. App. 4th 226, 70 Cal. Rptr.
3d 199 (2d Dist. 2007).) Thus, each element in a cause of action for fraud must be
factually and specifically alleged in a proper manner.  General and
conclusory allegations do not suffice, and the policy of liberal construction
of the pleadings will not ordinarily be invoked to sustain a pleading defective
in any material respect. (Cadlo v.
Owens-Illinois, Inc., 125 Cal. App. 4th 513, 23 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1 (1st Dist.
2004),
as modified, (Dec. 30, 2004); Murphy v. BDO
Seidman, LLP, 113 Cal. App. 4th 687, 6 Cal. Rptr. 3d 770 (2d Dist. 2003), as modified on
denial of reh'g, (Dec. 24, 2003).
 
Here, Plaintiff alleges that
“Defendants represented to Plaintiff that if Plaintiff provided funds to
Defendants, Defendants would have all of the funds wired (except for a fee) to
the bank account designated by Plaintiff.” This conclusive allegation does not meet the
particularity requirement. When did S. Zhang make the promise? How did
S. Zhang make the promise? Where did S. Zhang make the promise? Did all the
Defendants at one time, in one sentence, and in one utterance
make the promise to Plaintiff about making the money transfer? 
 
Plaintiff maintains that “it would be
appreciated if the Court would clarify what it wants because, again, the
undersigned does not understand the Court's comment because there are
allegations against S. Zhang.” (Supp. Motion p. 3:6-7.) It is not the court’s
responsibility to create Plaintiff’s case. The court directs Plaintiff to
pleading standards. The application is denied with prejudice; should
Plaintiff seek judgment against S. Zhang, it is to file a second amended
complaint. 
 
As for Chan’s declaration, Plaintiff
concedes its error, but then points the court to the declaration of another
individual who provides summaries of the transactions. (See DECLARATION OF SUCH
EN LUO IN SUPPORT OF REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT filed on 3/21/23.)
Luo’s declaration is inadmissible as Luo is merely a law school graduate who is
fluent in Mandarin; she is not an expert/certified translator to provide
summaries. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s application for default judgment is
denied with prejudice.
