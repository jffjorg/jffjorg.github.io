Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to refile the lis pendens against 530 S. Mapleton, Los Angeles, California. The plaintiff, Artur Ketikyan, through his successor in interest, Anna Sarajyan, moves to refile the lis pendens after the parties settled the action in open court on September 26, 2023. The settlement agreement includes a payment of $1,000,000 and a dismissal of the lawsuit with prejudice. However, the plaintiff does not demonstrate that the breach of the settlement agreement created a real property claim in his favor. The court finds that the settlement agreement is valid and that the plaintiff disclaimed any right to the 530 S. Mapleton property in exchange for $1 million. Therefore, the motion is denied. The court will consider the defendants' claim of attorneys' fees after considering the merits of the plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement.
