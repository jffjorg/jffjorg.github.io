 Case Number:  21STCV27987    Hearing Date:   January 30, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers, the Court rules as
follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
July 29, 2021, Plaintiff Cynthia Hopes (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Costco Wholesale Corporation (“Costco”), Sergio (Last Name Unknown),
and Does 1-50 for negligence. 
On
October 21, 2021, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint against Defendants
Costco, Sergio (Last Name Unknown), and Does 1-50 for negligence and premises
liability. On October 26, 2021, the Court struck the first amended complaint,
overruled Costco’s demurrer, and ordered Costco to answer. 
On
November 24, 2021, Costco filed an answer. 
On May
24, 2023, the Court granted Costco’s motion to continue the trial and continued
the trial from July 27, 2023 to February 27, 2024, with all discovery and
related dates set to trail the new trial date. 
On
December 21, 2023, the Court granted in part Costco’s ex parte application to
continue the trial and related dates. 
The Court continued the trial from February 27, 2024 to July 23, 2024,
but denied without prejudice Costco’s request to
continue or reopen discovery deadlines to correspond with the new trial date. 
On
January 3, 2024, Costco filed a motion to move the discovery cutoff and
trial-related dates to go with the current trial date and reopen discovery, to
be heard on January 30, 2024.  On January
17, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On January 23, 2024, Costco filed a
reply. 
Trial
is currently set for July 23, 2024. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Costco
requests that the Court continue discovery and all related dates to go with the
current trial date and reopen discovery. 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2024.020 provides: 
“(a) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any
party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery proceedings
on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery heard on or
before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of the action. 
“(b) Except as provided in Section 2024.050, a
continuance or postponement of the trial date does not operate to reopen
discovery proceedings.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2024.050 provides: 
“(a) On motion of any party, the court may grant leave
to complete discovery proceedings, or to have a motion concerning discovery
heard, closer to the initial trial date, or to reopen discovery after a new
trial date has been set. This motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040. 
“(b) In exercising its discretion to grant or deny
this motion, the court shall take into consideration any matter relevant to the
leave requested, including, but not limited to, the following: 
“(1) The necessity and the reasons for the discovery. 
“(2) The diligence or lack of diligence of the party
seeking the discovery or the hearing of a discovery motion, and the reasons
that the discovery was not completed or that the discovery motion was not heard
earlier. 
“(3) Any likelihood that permitting the discovery or
hearing the discovery motion will prevent the case from going to trial on the
date set, or otherwise interfere with the trial calendar, or result in prejudice
to any other party. 
“(4) The length of time that has elapsed between any
date previously set, and the date presently set, for the trial of the action. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to extend or to reopen
discovery, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2024.050.) 
DISCUSSION 
          Costco asks the Court to re-open discovery because (1) Plaintiff
had back surgery in September 2023, (2) between September 15, 2023 and November
2, 2023 Plaintiff’s claimed medical specials increased from approximately
$27,000 to over $950,000, and (3) in December 2023, Plaintiff disclosed a new
claim of incontinence that she attributes to the incident at Costco. 
          Plaintiff argues that Costco has not acted diligently in
conducting discovery and Plaintiff has already disclosed the information Costco
is requesting.  According to Plaintiff,
Costco “has known about all of Plaintiff’s injuries from the subject incident
and prior injuries since December 24, 2021, when Plaintiff served its initial
set of discovery responses.”  (Opposition
p. 3.)  Plaintiff asserts that she
disclosed a recommendation for back surgery at her February 2, 2023 deposition
and disclosed all of her previous injuries, including back pain, at a May 4,
2023 defense medical examination.  Plaintiff does not, however, challenge Costco’s
contention that Plaintiff’s claimed medical specials increased from approximately
$27,000 to over $950,000 between September 15, 2023 and November 2, 2023. 
The
Court has considered the factors listed in Code of Civil Procedure section
2024.050 and grants the motion to reopen discovery. 
Discovery
is reopened.  Discovery and related
deadlines will be based on the July 23, 2024 trial date.            
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Defendant Costco Wholesale
Corporation’s motion to reopen discovery. 
Discovery is reopened.  Discovery
and related deadlines will be based on the July 23, 2024 trial date. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
