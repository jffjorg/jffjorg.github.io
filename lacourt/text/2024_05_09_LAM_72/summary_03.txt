Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

"The court has denied the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Lorraine Perez, filed a complaint on April 30, 2024, alleging discriminatory practices and violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act. The defendant, Young C. Shin and Ok Ja Shin, moved to strike the complaint on January 17, 2024, arguing that it was not verified. The plaintiff filed a first amended complaint on February 23, 2024, which contained verification by the plaintiff's attorney. The defendant then filed an amended motion to strike, arguing that the first amended complaint was still not verified. The plaintiff then filed a second amended complaint on April 15, 2024, which contains verification by the plaintiff. The court has granted leave to amend and has denied the motion to strike as moot. The court has also granted leave to file the second amended complaint. The court finds that it is in the interests of justice and judicial economy to grant leave to amend, since the plaintiff is able to cure the defects identified in the motion to strike."
