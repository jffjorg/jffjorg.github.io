Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the demurrer and motion to strike filed by FPI Management, Inc. (FPI) and has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend. The Complaint filed by Plaintiffs Nasser Eshraghi, Khashayar Eshragi, and Thomas Franklin (Plaintiffs) does not identify any wrongful acts taken by FPI. FPI was not involved in the management of the property until November 28, 2022, which is too late for FPI to be liable for any alleged wrongdoings. The Court finds that the Complaint is too vague and unclear, making it impossible for FPI to respond to the allegations. Plaintiffs must amend their Complaint to clarify the allegations and provide specificity as to the wrongful acts committed by FPI.
