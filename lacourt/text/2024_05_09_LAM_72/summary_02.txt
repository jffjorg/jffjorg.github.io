And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages without leave to amend. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant terminated his employment in violation of public policy due to his protected statuses. However, the plaintiff's allegations do not provide sufficient evidence of malice, oppression, or fraud. The judge notes that the plaintiff's allegations of managerial status by Brett Golod and Stephanie Doe are also inadequate. The judge grants the motion to strike, but will consider the plaintiff's request to amend the complaint if the plaintiff can provide sufficient evidence to support its claims.
