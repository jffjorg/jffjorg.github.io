Defendant T.D. Trauth (“Defendant”) demurs to the Complaint
filed by Plaintiff Linda Greif, Trustee of the Greif Family Trust
(“Plaintiff”). 
 
The Court OVERRULES the demurrer.
 
Background
 
            This
is an unlawful detainer case. The following facts are taken from the Complaint
and supporting documents.
 
            Defendant
is a tenant at the residential property located at 725 N. Sweetzer Avenue, Unit
102, Los Angeles, California 90069 (the “Property”). Plaintiff is the landlord
and owner of the Property. Plaintiff agreed to rent the property month-to-month
and pay rent of $2,100.00 per month.
 
            On
March 12, 2024, Plaintiff served Defendant with a three-day notice to pay rent
or quit (the “Notice”) by posting it on the premises. The Notice stated that
Plaintiff owed $29,400.00 in unpaid rent for the period of February 15, 2022
through April 14, 2023.
 
            Plaintiff
filed this action on March 22, 2022, seeking past-due rent of $29,400.00,
attorney’s fees, forfeiture of the agreement, and damages.
 
Legal Standard
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading
alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants,
Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) The court assumes the truth
of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.) The only issue a demurrer is
concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of
action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be
allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335,
348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Ibid.;
Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f
there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause
of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).
 
Discussion
 
Defendant argues that the Complaint is unverified and that
it is therefore subject to demurrer. However, Plaintiff provided verification
in an attachment to the Complaint. (Complaint at p. 4; Complaint at PDF p. 9.)
 
Defendant additionally argues that the Complaint fails to
state a cause of action, but does not identify any defects of the Complaint
that result in it failing to state a cause of action.
 
The Court therefore overrules the demurrer.
