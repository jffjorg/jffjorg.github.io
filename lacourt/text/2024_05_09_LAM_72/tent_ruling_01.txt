Defendants Adaptive Realty Inc. (“Adaptive Realty”) and
Avenue 55 Ventures, LLC (“Avenue 55”) (collectively, “Defendants”) move for

request summary adjudication.
 
The Court DENIES Defendants’ motion for summary judgment.
 
The Court DENIES Defendants’ motion for summary
adjudication.
 
Background
 
This is a landlord-tenant case. Danielle Diab, Harley Lally,
Devin Davis, Karin Neuman, Laura Ramanei, and Claire Johnson (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) are tenants at real property located at 201 N. Avenue 55, (the
“Property”) Units 201 and 202 (the “Premises”). Defendant Avenue 55 is the
owner of the premises. Defendant Adaptive Realty is the property manager of the
Premises.
 
Plaintiffs allege a number of defects in the Premises.
Plaintiffs allege that there were leaks at multiple times in 2021 and 2022.
Plaintiffs allege that the gates to the Property stopped functioning in January
2022, locking Plaintiff’s in. Plaintiffs allege that the defective conditions
at the Premises are ongoing. (Complaint ¶¶ 51-52.)
 
In January 2022, Defendants began construction of the
outside areas of the Property. (Undisputed Material Fact (“UMF”) 5.) Plaintiffs
allege that this construction was unpermitted. Plaintiffs allege that this
prevented their access to amenities and that Defendants elected illegal
scaffolding and consistently created noise. Construction occurred from January
31, 2022 to May 9, 2022.
 
            On
March 28, 2022, Plaintiffs Diab and Lally informed Defendants of two window
leaks and agreed to vacate the premises to allow for repairs. (UMF 10.) On
April 28, Adaptive Realty sent a proposed settlement and release agreement to
Diab and Lally. (UMF 11.) On May 2, 2022, Diab sent Adaptive Reality a redline
of the agreement with the general release provisions crossed out. (UMF 12; Ex.
A.) Defendants stated that they would not agree to the settlement without the
general release provisions. (UMF 13.) On May 4, 2022, Diab and Lally executed a
settlement agreement with Adaptive Realty (the “May 4 Agreement”). (UMF 14, Ex.
B.)
 
Davis informed Defendants of a similar window leak on March
28, 2022 as well, and also agreed to vacate the premises. (UMF 16.)  On May 5, 2022, Davis executed a similar
agreement with Adaptive Realty (the “May 5 Agreement”) (collectively with the
May 4 Agreement, “the Agreements”). (UMF 17; Ex. C.)
 
            Each
of the Agreements contained substantially similar general release clauses,
which release Adaptive Realty and all of its business partners from any known
or unknown claims that Diab, Lally, and Davis had against them at the time of
execution. (Ex. B at p. 2; Ex. C at p. 2.) Both of the Agreements expressly
disclaim any release of future claims unrelated to the window leaks. (Ex. B at
p. 1; Ex. C at p. 1.) 
 
Plaintiffs allege that in May, June, and July of an
unspecified year, presumably 2021 or 2022, Defendants have harassed Plaintiffs
and threatened Plaintiffs with harm if Plaintiffs do not voluntarily vacate the
Premises. (Complaint ¶ 86.) Plaintiffs allege that this ‘campaign’ against them
has continued at least through the time at which the Complaint was filed.
(Complaint ¶¶ 87, 89.)
 
Plaintiff filed this action against Defendants on October 4,
2022, raising claims for (1) violation of Civil Code, section 1942.4; (2)
tortuous [sic] breach of warranty of habitability; (3) breach of the covenant
of quiet enjoyment; (4) nuisance; (5) violation of Business & Professions
Code, sections 17200, set seq.; (6) negligence and negligent hiring and
training; (7) intrusion under Civil Code, section 1708.85; and (8) violations
of Anti-Tenant Harassment Ordinances LAMC 49.99 and 445.33.
 
Defendants moved for summary judgment on January 24, 2024. Responding
Plaintiffs filed an opposition and Defendants filed a reply.
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
Defendants request that the Court takes judicial notice of
Plaintiffs’ Complaint and Defendants’ First Amended Answer. The Court denies
this request as moot because those materials are already in the record.
 
Legal Standard
 
The purpose of a motion for
summary judgment or summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism
to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite
their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 843.) “Code of
Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to
grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences
reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences
or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and
that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) 
 
“In ruling on the motion,
the court must consider all of the evidence and all of the inferences
reasonably drawn therefrom [citation] and must view such evidence [citations]
and such inferences [citations] in the light most favorable to the opposing
party.” (Aguilar, supra, at pp. 844-845 [quotation marks
omitted].) 
 
“On a motion for summary
judgment, the initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima
facie
showing that there are no triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf v. D. B.
Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant moving
for summary judgment or summary adjudication “has met his or her burden of
showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or
more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there
is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(p)(2).) 
 
“Once the defendant . . .
has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.” (Ibid.) To establish a triable issue of material
fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive
evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.) “If the plaintiff cannot do
so, summary judgment should be granted.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente
Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.)
 
Discussion
 
Summary Judgment
 
Defendants argue that the Agreements release them from
liability for all of Plaintiffs’ claims in this action. Plaintiffs argue that
no valid agreements were formed.
 
Both of the Agreements expressly disclaim any release of
future claims unrelated to the window leaks. (Ex. B at p. 1; Ex. C at p. 1.)
The Agreements were executed on May 4, 2022 and May 5, 2022.
 
Plaintiffs allege in their anti-tenant harassment claim that
in May, June, and July of an unspecified year, apparently either 2021 or 2022,
Defendants have harassed Plaintiffs and threatened Plaintiffs with harm if
Plaintiffs do not voluntarily vacate the Premises. (Complaint ¶ 86.) Plaintiffs
allege that this ‘campaign’ against them has continued at least through the time
at which the Complaint was filed in October 2022. (Complaint ¶¶ 87, 89.) These
events are therefore not covered by the Agreements, which they post-date.
 
It is true that Responding Plaintiffs do not provide
evidence of these events in their separate statement. However, it is not their
burden – at least initially – to do so. “On a motion
for summary judgment, the initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no triable issues of material
fact.” (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc., supra, 128 Cal.App.4th at
p. 1519.) Defendants have not shown that there is a lack of triable issue of
material fact on the anti-tenant harassment claim, either due to the Agreements
or for any other reason.
 
Because Defendants have not shown
that they are not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the
anti-harassment claim, the Court denies the motion for summary judgment.
 
Motion for Summary Adjudication
 
“If summary adjudication is sought, whether separately or as
an alternative to the motion for summary judgment, the specific cause of
action, affirmative defense, claims for damages, or issues of duty must be
stated specifically in the notice of motion[.]” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1350, subd. (b).)
 
Defendants do not identify the issues on which they seek
summary adjudication in the notice, nor is this clear from their brief or
separate statement. The Court therefore denies the motion for summary
adjudication of issues.
