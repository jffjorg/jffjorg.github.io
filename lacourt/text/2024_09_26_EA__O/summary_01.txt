```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge continues the hearing on the defendant's motion for summary judgment or adjudication of the issues, pending supplemental briefing. The defendant argues that they did not know or should not have known about the alleged sexual misconduct of teacher Kimberly Northrop, and therefore cannot be held liable for negligence or negligent supervision and retention. The plaintiff argues that the defendant had a duty to train staff to recognize and report inappropriate behavior, and to enact adequate policies and procedures. The judge finds that the defendant's motion is largely focused on the application process and background checks, and that the issue of failure to enact policies is only raised in reply. Therefore, the judge continues the hearing for supplemental briefing on the issue of negligence. The hearing on the motion for summary judgment or adjudication of the issues is continued pending the supplemental briefing.
