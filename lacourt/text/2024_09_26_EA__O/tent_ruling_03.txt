Background
 
This case arises from a motor vehicle accident that happened on
7/21/2022.
 
On February 3, 2022, Plaintiff Adam Brown filed suit against Defendants COMMERCIAL
ROCK CO. and ANGEL LOPEZ CURIEL.
 
On March 8, 2024, Defendants filed their answer.
 
On September 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed the two instant
applications. 
 
Discussion
 
Boylan and Lester seek to appear as counsel pro hac vice in
this action on behalf of Plaintiff. The attorneys would appear in association
with Jerry Ruslky of Morgan and Morgan; Plaintiff seeks to have them serve as
trial counsel for the matter (and all other aspects). Considering that the application comports with California
Rules of Court, Rule 9.40, the court grants both applications.[1]
