And here is the summary in English text:

The court's tentative ruling addresses a motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant, CVUSD, against the plaintiff, Nothrop/Northrup (the spelling of whose name is unclear). The court notes that the motion does not address all theories of liability and does not clarify whether it is seeking summary judgment or summary adjudication. The court requests the defendant to clarify the form of relief sought in its supplemental briefing. Additionally, the court notes that the plaintiff has dismissed the 4th cause of action and that the defendant's motion does not address the remaining causes of action. The court will only discuss the negligence-based causes of action.
