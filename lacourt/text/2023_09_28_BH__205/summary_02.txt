## Summary of Tentative Ruling

The judge is considering a motion by Tenant, SHEGERIAN & ASSOCIATES, APC, to seal certain documents filed in opposition to the Landlord's motion for summary judgment.  The Tenant argues that the documents contain private medical information and should be protected under a prior Protective Order. 

However, the judge is concerned that the Tenant hasn't adequately identified the specific documents they want sealed and hasn't sufficiently demonstrated that the documents are indeed medical records. As a result, the judge denies the motion to seal without prejudice, meaning the Tenant can refile the motion with more specific information.

The judge emphasizes the public's right to access court proceedings and requires compelling reasons to justify sealing documents.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to seal evidence without prejudice. The motion was filed in response to the defendant's motion for summary judgment and/or summary adjudication. The plaintiff claimed that the documents sought to be sealed contain private medical and sensitive information, which would violate the privacy rights of Carney Shegerian, the plaintiff's CEO. The plaintiff argued that the disclosure of this information would cause harm and that the court should order the documents to be filed under seal.

However, the judge did not find that the plaintiff had sufficiently identified or described the documents sought to be sealed, including by specifying the exhibit numbers. The judge also noted that the court's duty is to presume openness in civil court proceedings, and that the plaintiff must demonstrate compelling reasons, prejudice absent sealing, and the lack of less-restrictive means to overcome this presumption.

The judge concluded that the plaintiff had not met the burden of proof to demonstrate that the documents sought to be sealed are entitled to protection from public disclosure. Therefore, the motion to seal was denied without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff can refile the motion with additional information and evidence to support its claims.

English Summary:
This tentative ruling is for a case (20SMCV00998) scheduled for a hearing on September 28, 2023, at the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles – West District, Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205. The plaintiff, SHEGERIAN & ASSOCIATES, APC f/k/a SHEGERIAN & ASSOCIATES, INC., and the defendant, HIGH NOON OFFICE, LLC, are involved in a dispute over a commercial lease for the 4th and 7th floors of the Clocktower Building located at 225 Santa Monica Boulevard, Santa Monica, California. The defendant's cross-complaint alleges four causes of action, including breach of contract and declaratory relief for failure to pay rent.

The current hearing is about the plaintiff's motion to seal evidence filed in opposition to the defendant's motion for summary judgment and/or summary adjudication. The plaintiff argues that the documents contain private medical and sensitive information, which would violate Carney Shegerian's privacy rights if disclosed. These documents were also designated as "confidential" pursuant to an Amended Stipulation and Protective Order. However, no opposition was filed as of the posting of this tentative ruling.

The court must identify the specific information claimed to be entitled to protection from public disclosure, the nature of the harm threatened by disclosure, and any countervailing considerations before ruling on a motion to seal. The California Supreme Court has held that there is a presumption of openness in civil court proceedings, and compelling reasons, prejudice absent sealing, and the lack of less-restrictive means must be present before ordering filed documents sealed.

In this case, the plaintiff has not sufficiently identified or described the documents sought to be sealed, making it difficult for the court to determine if they are medical records. As a result, the court denies the tenant's motion to seal without prejudice.
