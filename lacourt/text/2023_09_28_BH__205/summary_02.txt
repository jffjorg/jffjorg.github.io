And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied without prejudice the Plaintiff's motion to file records under seal. The Plaintiff sought to seal documents containing private medical and sensitive information, citing an Amended Stipulation and Protective Order. The Court found that the Plaintiff did not sufficiently identify or describe the documents sought to be sealed, and therefore, the motion was denied. The Court emphasized the importance of transparency in civil court proceedings, citing the California Supreme Court's holding that the First Amendment provides a right of access to ordinary civil trial and proceedings. The Court also noted that compelling reasons, prejudice absent sealing, and the lack of less-restrictive means must be shown before ordering filed documents sealed.
