Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendant Casa Gateway Homeowners Association's (HOA) motion to strike the plaintiffs' renewed motion for summary adjudication. The HOA argued that the plaintiffs' motion was an improper attempt to rehear issues that had already been adjudicated, and that the plaintiffs failed to meet the requirements for a motion for reconsideration. The judge finds that the HOA's arguments are without merit. The judge concludes that the plaintiffs' renewed motion for summary adjudication is proper, as it presents new and different facts and law from the prior motion. The judge also finds that the HOA's motion to strike was improper, as it is not a proper vehicle to strike a motion for summary adjudication. The judge orders that the HOA's motion to strike be denied.

## English Text Summary:

This document is a tentative ruling by Judge Edward B. Moreton, Jr. regarding a dispute over parking spaces in a condominium building in Pacific Palisades. 

Plaintiffs George C. Kopek, Toni Kopek, and Richard Lee are suing their neighbors, Bagram and Susanna Mardirossian, for allegedly occupying their parking spaces without permission. They are also suing the Casa Gateway Homeowners Association (HOA) for failing to enforce parking restrictions outlined in the building's governing documents.

The HOA previously argued that Plaintiffs' initial motion for summary adjudication was improperly filed. Judge Moreton agreed, denying the motion due to procedural defects. However, Plaintiffs filed a renewed motion addressing these issues. 

The HOA then moved to strike the renewed motion, claiming it was redundant and wasteful. Judge Moreton denied this motion, finding that the renewed motion presents different legal arguments and addresses the previous procedural errors. 

The hearing, therefore, focused on the renewed motion for summary adjudication, which seeks to clarify liability regarding the parking spaces.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of George C. Kopek, Toni Kopek, and Richard Lee vs. Bagram Mardirossian, Susanna Mardirossian, and Casa Gateway Homeowners Association. The case involves a dispute over parking spaces in a condominium building in Pacific Palisades. The plaintiffs claim ownership of two parking spaces and that the defendants are illegally occupying them. The homeowners association (HOA) is also a defendant and is accused of failing to enforce bylaws and CC&Rs.

The HOA has moved to strike the plaintiffs' renewed motion for summary adjudication, arguing that the motion is an improper attempt to rehear issues that have already been adjudicated. However, the judge has denied the HOA's motion, finding that it is not a proper vehicle to strike a motion for summary adjudication. The judge also notes that the issues asserted in the prior motion are different from the issues asserted in the present motion, and that the Court's denial of the prior motion was without prejudice to the plaintiffs' ability to renew the motion with a code-compliant separate statement.

The judge has also considered the HOA's argument that the plaintiffs failed to meet the requirements for a motion for reconsideration under California Code of Civil Procedure § 1008. However, the judge has found that the plaintiffs have not filed a motion for reconsideration, but rather a renewal of a motion for summary adjudication that was denied based on a procedural defect that was subject to cure. The judge has also noted that there are different facts alleged in the separate statement of facts, which are designed to cure the defects noted by the Court in its prior ruling.

Based on the foregoing, the judge has denied the HOA's motion to strike the plaintiffs' renewed motion for summary adjudication.

This tentative ruling is for a hearing on a motion to strike Plaintiffs’ renewed motion for summary adjudication. The case involves a dispute over parking spaces in a condominium building in Pacific Palisades. Plaintiffs George C. Kopek, Toni Kopek, and Richard S. Lee claim ownership of two parking spaces, G114 and G116, and allege that Defendants Bagram and Susanna Mardirossian are illegally occupying the spaces. Plaintiffs have also sued their homeowners association, Casa Gateway Homeowners Association (HOA), for failing to enforce bylaws and a Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (CC&R’s).

Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary adjudication against HOA, seeking adjudication of two affirmative defenses. However, the Court denied the motion based on a procedural defect that the separate statement failed to identify all material facts. Plaintiffs have now renewed their motion for summary adjudication against the HOA.

The HOA argues that the renewed motion is an improper attempt to rehear issues that have already been adjudicated without presenting anything new or different. The Court denies the HOA’s motion to strike Plaintiffs’ renewed motion for summary adjudication.
