And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to stay or consolidate the unlawful detainer action and the civil action. The plaintiff seeks to stay the unlawful detainer action or consolidate it with the civil action, arguing that the cases share common questions of fact and law and that a stay or consolidation would avoid duplicative litigation and inconsistent rulings. The defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the cases are not related and that the plaintiff should have sought reconsideration of the notice of related case before filing the motion.

The judge finds that the cases are not related and that the motion to consolidate is procedurally defective. The judge also notes that the unlawful detainer action and the civil action are currently being heard in different departments, and that the Court would have no jurisdiction to issue orders on a case not before it.

The judge grants both parties' requests for judicial notice and denies the motion to stay or consolidate the cases. The judge concludes that the plaintiff should have sought reconsideration of the notice of related case prior to filing the motion and that the motion is procedurally defective.
