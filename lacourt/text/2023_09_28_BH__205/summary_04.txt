```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to stay or consolidate the unlawful detainer action and the civil action. The plaintiff seeks to stay the unlawful detainer action or consolidate it with the civil action, arguing that the cases share common questions of fact and law and that a stay or consolidation would avoid duplicative litigation and inconsistent rulings. The defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the cases are not related and that the plaintiff should have sought reconsideration of the notice of related case before filing the motion.

The judge finds that the cases are not related and that the motion to consolidate is procedurally defective. The judge also notes that the unlawful detainer action and the civil action are currently being heard in different departments, and that the Court would have no jurisdiction to issue orders on a case not before it.

The judge grants both parties' requests for judicial notice and denies the motion to stay or consolidate the cases. The judge concludes that the plaintiff should have sought reconsideration of the notice of related case prior to filing the motion and that the motion is procedurally defective.

## English Summary

The judge reviewed a motion filed by Plaintiff Melanie Kleine Hillmann to either stay (temporarily halt) the unlawful detainer action filed by Defendant Andreas Christian Renner or to consolidate the two cases. The judge found the motion to consolidate procedurally defective because the two cases were not related in the court system.  

The judge also noted that the Plaintiff should have sought reconsideration of the earlier order finding the cases unrelated before filing the consolidation motion. 

Therefore, the judge denied both the motion to stay the unlawful detainer action and the motion to consolidate the cases.

The court has also denied the motion to stay the unlawful detainer action because it would require that both actions be before this department. The court has granted both parties' requests for judicial notice of certain documents.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to stay the unlawful detainer action or to consolidate the civil action with the unlawful detainer action. The plaintiff, Melanie Kleine Hillmann, had filed a civil action against the defendant, Andreas Christian Renner, alleging various causes of action related to her ownership interest in a property located at 11540 Barman Avenue, Culver City, CA 90230. The defendant had filed an unlawful detainer action seeking to evict the plaintiff from the property. The court found that the two actions were not related and were being heard in different departments, making the motion to consolidate procedurally defective. The court also found that a stay of the unlawful detainer action would require that both actions be before the same department, which is not the case here. The court denied the plaintiff's motion and suggested that the plaintiff should have sought reconsideration of the notice of related case prior to filing her motion for consolidation or to stay.

Summary:
---------

The tentative ruling concerns a dispute over ownership of a home located at 11540 Barman Avenue, Culver City, CA 90230. Plaintiff Melanie Kleine Hillmann and Defendant Andreas Christian Renner were in a relationship when they bought the Property, with title taken in Renner’s name alone. Hillman contends the parties orally agreed the Property belonged to both equally, and paid half of the mortgage, homeowner’s insurance, and property taxes. After the relationship ended, Renner sought reimbursement for amounts paid towards the Property, and Hillman filed a civil action against Renner asserting six claims related to her alleged ownership interest in the Property.

On July 25, 2023, Hillman filed a notice of related case in both actions. However, the court in Department S determined the cases were not related. Hillman then filed a motion to stay the unlawful detainer action or to consolidate the cases for trial. The Court denied the motion, as the two actions were not related and were being heard in different departments. The Court also noted that staying the unlawful detainer action would be an appropriate alternative if both actions were before the same Department.
