 Case Number:  20SMCV00998    Hearing Date:   September 28, 2023    Dept:  205    Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   SHEGERIAN & ASSOCIATES, APC f/k/a SHEGERIAN & ASSOCIATES, INC..,    Plaintiff, v.  HIGH NOON OFFICE, LLC, et al.,    Defendant.    Case No.:  20SMCV00998     Hearing Date:  September 28, 2023   ORDER RE:   PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO FILE RECORDS    UNDER SEAL PURSUANT TO    PROTECTIVE ORDER DATED JUNE 5,    2023 AND CALIFORNIA RULES OF    COURT, RULES 2.550 & 2.551     BACKGROUND This action arises from a breach of a commercial lease.  Defendant High Noon Office, LLC is the Landlord, and Plaintiff Shegerian & Associates APC f/k/a Shegerian & Associates Inc. is the Tenant.  Tenant leases the 4th and 7th floors of a commercial office building known as the Clocktower Building, located at 225 Santa Monica Boulevard, Santa Monica, California (the “Property”).  Tenant brought an action to seek a declaration excusing its failure to pay rent for the 7th floor based on an interpretation of the Lease that this Court found would yield “absurd results.”  This Court sustained Landlord’s demurrer of the original and amended complaints, finding “[t]here [was] no actual controversy alleged here, as plaintiff’s interpretation [was] forced and unreasonable.”  Only Landlord’s cross-complaint remains before the Court.  The cross-complaint against Tenant, alleges four causes of action for (1) declaratory relief – commencement of the 7th Floor Lease, (2) breach of contract and declaratory relief for failure to pay rent, (3) breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and (4) declaratory relief allowing collection of rent pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code §1951.4.   This hearing is on Tenant’s motion to seal evidence filed in opposition to Landlord’s motion for summary judgment and/or summary adjudication.  Tenant maintains the documents sought to be sealed contain private medical and sensitive information, the disclosure of which would violate Carney Shegerian’s privacy rights.  The documents were also designated as “confidential” pursuant to an Amended Stipulation and Protective Order.  No opposition was filed as of the posting of this tentative ruling.     DISCUSSION An application to seal must be accompanied by a declaration containing facts sufficient to justify sealing. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 2.551(b)(1).)  Plaintiff has submitted the declaration of Ryan D. Kashfian explaining the facts which justify sealing.     A court may order records to be filed under seal when the following conditions are met: “(1) [t]here exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record[s]; (2) [t]he overriding interest supports sealing the record[s]; (3) [a] substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record[s are] not sealed; (4) [t]he proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) [n]o less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.”  (Cal. Rules of Court 2.550(d).) In ruling on a motion to seal, the court must identify (1) the specific information claimed to be entitled to protection from public disclosure, (2) the nature of the harm threatened by disclosure, and (3) any countervailing considerations. (H.B. Fuller Co. v. Doe (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 879, 894.) Therefore, in order to prevail on his or her motion, the moving party must present a specific enumeration of the facts sought to be withheld and the specific reasons for withholding them. (Id. at 904.) The California Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment provides “a right of access to ordinary civil trial and proceedings.” (NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1212.)  The court further noted its belief that “the public has an interest, in all civil cases, in observing and assessing the performance of its public judicial system.”  (Id. at 1210.)  There is a presumption of openness in civil court proceedings. (Id. at 1217.)  Therefore, it is up to this Court to determine if that presumption has been overcome. Courts must find compelling reasons, prejudice absent sealing and the lack of less-restrictive means, before ordering filed documents sealed. (Hurvitz v. Hoefflin (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 1232, 1246; KNBC-TV, 20 Cal.4th at 1208-1209 n. 25; Champion v. Superior Court (1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 777, 787.)  A compelling reason could include the party’s right to privacy of medical records.  (Oiye v. Fox (2012) 211 Cal. App. 4th 1036, 1068-1070.) A proposed sealing must also be narrowly tailored to serve the overriding interest, such as by sealing only portions of pleadings or redacting particular text that refer to the confidential information. (In re Marriage of Burkle (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1045, 1052, 1070.)   Here, Tenant has not sufficiently identified or described the documents sought to be sealed, including by specifying the exhibit numbers.  While there is a right to privacy in medical records, the Court cannot conclude based on this record that the documents sought to be sealed are medical records.   CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES without prejudice Tenant’s motion to seal.    IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: September 28, 2023    ___________________________ Edward B.
