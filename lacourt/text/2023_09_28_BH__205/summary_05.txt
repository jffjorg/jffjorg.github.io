This is the tentative ruling on Defendant Jose Jesus Flores' motion for summary judgment in the case of CENTURY SURETY COMPANY vs. JOSE JESUS FLORES, et al. (Case No. 22STCV04627). The dispute arises from a subrogation claim related to a lease agreement between the parties. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff's right of subrogation was contractually waived by its insured and the waiver is valid and enforceable. The Court agrees with the Defendant and finds that the Plaintiff cannot bring an action against the Defendant because its insured expressly waived the right to do so. The Court also finds that there is no disputed issue that the Defendant did not engage in gross negligence or willful misconduct. Therefore, the Court grants the Defendant's motion for summary judgment and dismisses the Plaintiff's claims.
