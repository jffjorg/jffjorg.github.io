And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Jose Jesus Flores' motion for summary judgment. The judge found that the subrogation waiver provision in the lease agreement between Plaintiff's insured and Defendant is valid and enforceable. The judge concluded that the waiver operates to waive or release the rights of contracting parties with respect to claims covered by insurance, and that Plaintiff cannot bring an action against Defendant because its insured expressly waived the right to do so. The judge also found that the breach of the lease by Defendant did not invalidate the subrogation clause, and that the waiver does not apply to intentional torts. The judge rejected Plaintiff's arguments that the waiver is unenforceable due to Defendant's breach of the lease or intentional torts.
