And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the motion for determination of a good faith settlement filed by Medical Depot, Inc. and McKesson Medical Surgical, Inc. (Moving Defendants). The settlement amount is $35,000, contingent upon the court determining that the settlement is in good faith and barring all existing or future claims for contribution and/or indemnity against the Moving Defendants. The court will consider six factors to determine whether the settlement is in good faith, including a rough approximation of plaintiff's total recovery and the settlor's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds, a discount for settlement before trial, the financial condition and insurance policy limits of the settling defendants, and the existence of collusion, fraud, or other tortious conduct aimed at injuring the interests of non-settling defendants. The court concludes that the settlement amount is well within the range of Moving Defendants' potential proportionate liability, considering the disputes regarding causation, comparative liability, and whether a defect even exists. The court grants the motion and determines that the settlement was made in good faith.

## English Summary

The judge in this case has tentatively ruled that the settlement between Plaintiff Margaret Medina and Medical Depot, Inc. and McKesson Medical Surgical, Inc. is in good faith. 

The judge considered several factors, including the amount of the settlement ($35,000), the potential liability of the settling defendants, and the absence of any evidence of collusion or fraud. The judge found that the settlement amount is reasonable given the disputed facts of the case, particularly the question of whether the walker malfunctioned or if the uneven parkway was the primary cause of the fall.


The judge also noted that the settlement was reached after lengthy negotiations and that the settling defendants shared the terms with the remaining defendants. Based on these factors, the judge concluded that the settlement is a fair resolution to the dispute.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for determination of good faith settlement brought by Medical Depot, Inc. dba Drive Devilbiss Healthcare and McKesson Medical Surgical, Inc. (Moving Defendants) regarding their settlement with the plaintiff, Margaret Medina. The settlement was for $35,000 and is contingent upon the court determining that it was made in good faith.

The judge analyzed the settlement under the factors set forth in Tech-Bilt Inc. V. Woodward-Clyde & Assocs. (1985), including the rough approximation of the plaintiff's total recovery and the settler's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds, the discount for settlement before trial, the financial condition and insurance policy limits of the settling defendants, and the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed at injuring the interests of non-settling defendants.

The judge found that the settlement amount was well within the ballpark of the Moving Defendants' potential proportionate liability, considering the disputes regarding causation, comparative liability, and whether a defect even exists. The judge also found that the settlement was made in good faith, as there was no evidence of collusion, fraud, or other tortious conduct aimed at injuring the interests of non-settling defendants.

Based on these findings, the judge granted the Moving Defendants' motion for determination of good faith settlement.
