And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the motion for determination of a good faith settlement filed by Medical Depot, Inc. and McKesson Medical Surgical, Inc. (Moving Defendants). The settlement amount is $35,000, contingent upon the court determining that the settlement is in good faith and barring all existing or future claims for contribution and/or indemnity against the Moving Defendants. The court will consider six factors to determine whether the settlement is in good faith, including a rough approximation of plaintiff's total recovery and the settlor's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds, a discount for settlement before trial, the financial condition and insurance policy limits of the settling defendants, and the existence of collusion, fraud, or other tortious conduct aimed at injuring the interests of non-settling defendants. The court concludes that the settlement amount is well within the range of Moving Defendants' potential proportionate liability, considering the disputes regarding causation, comparative liability, and whether a defect even exists. The court grants the motion and determines that the settlement was made in good faith.
