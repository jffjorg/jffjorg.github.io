And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"This tentative ruling accepts BMW's counsel's assertion that they were never served with the moving papers. As a result, the motions to compel further responses to special interrogatories and requests for production of documents will be continued, with opposition and reply to be filed and served per code. This will give BMW an opportunity to respond to the arguments presented in the moving papers and avoid any potential prejudice to BMW."
