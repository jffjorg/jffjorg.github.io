This is a suit relating to unpaid attorneys’ fees and an outstanding loan.  On January 23, 2023, Plaintiffs Thris Van Taylor, A Law Corporation, and Thris Van Taylor filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) for (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of third party contract, (3) breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (4) negligence, (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress (“IIED”), (6) fraud, (7) intentional misrepresentation, and (8) conversion.Defendant Katie Little seeks to compel further responses to her requests for production from Plaintiffs.  There are 216 requests at issue.  These requests seek documents supporting Plaintiffs’ bill of particulars.  As an initial matter, this Motion was improperly filed as a “motion to compel discovery (‘not further discovery’)” in the Court’s reservation system, when in fact it does seek further responses.  This is abusive behavior that can be sanctioned.Further, there is no separate statement, but rather a concise outline of items in dispute.  Defendant, however, never obtained approval to file such an outline.Next, while most of the objections lack merit, it is not clear that Plaintiffs are withholding any necessary documents on the basis of their objections.  It seems that handwritten notes were omitted, but Defendant’s papers do not specifically discuss this issue.  The only other issue is the assertion of privileges.  If Plaintiffs are withholding any documents based on a privilege, then its existence must be explained or a log must be provided.It seems that Defendant is primarily upset about the place and timing of production.  Plaintiffs, however, appeared at defense counsel’s law offices with 6 boxes of documents.  It’s not as though they refuse to allow an inspection.  The inspection should be completed within 30 days at a location chosen by defense counsel.  The Motion is granted in part only as set forth herein.  The requests for sanctions are denied. Moving party to give notice.
