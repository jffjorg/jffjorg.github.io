And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a dispute between Thris Van Taylor, A Law Corporation, and Thris Van Taylor (the "Plaintiffs") and Katie Little (the "Defendant") over unpaid attorneys' fees and an outstanding loan. The Defendant sought to compel further responses to her requests for production from the Plaintiffs, which the judge has granted in part. The judge notes that the Defendant's motion was improperly filed and that the Plaintiffs have not withheld any necessary documents on the basis of their objections. The judge orders the Plaintiffs to provide a log of documents withheld based on privilege and for the inspection of documents to be completed within 30 days at a location chosen by defense counsel. The judge denies the Defendant's requests for sanctions.
