And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in the case of Zixuan An v. American Franchise Regional Center, LLC, et al. The case involves allegations of breach of contract, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, conspiracy to commit fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, professional negligence, unauthorized practice of law, and unfair business practices.

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment against Hu, Young, Hu & Associates, and Universo. The judge found that most of the plaintiff's claims are barred by the statute of limitations. The plaintiff's claims against Hu and Hu & Associates for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and professional negligence are subject to Code of Civil Procedure section 340.6, which requires an action to be commenced within one year after the plaintiff discovers the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission.

The judge also found that the plaintiff's fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims against Hu and Hu & Associates are subject to Code of Civil Procedure sections 338(d) and 339(1), which provide for a 3-year and 2-year statute of limitations, respectively.

The judge did not find that Hu engaged in the unauthorized practice of law, as he was federally authorized to provide representation in immigration matters. Therefore, the judge denied the application for default judgment.

The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit.
