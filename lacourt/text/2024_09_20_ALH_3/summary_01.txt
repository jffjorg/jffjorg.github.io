And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents and things (Set One) from the defendant, Oral Aesthetic Advocacy Group, Inc. dba Cosmetic Dentistry Grants. The motion is unopposed, but the defendant fails to demonstrate good cause for its objections. The court grants the motion with respect to requests for production of documents and things numbered 1-10, 12-19, 21-23, and 25. The court denies the motion with respect to requests for production of documents and things numbered 11, 20, 24, 26, and 27, finding that these requests are too broad or lack a sufficient connection to the claims asserted. The court also orders the defendant to pay sanctions of $1,050 to the plaintiff.
