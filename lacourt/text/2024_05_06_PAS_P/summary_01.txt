The Judge rules that Ford's demurrer to the Second Cause of Action for Violation of Civil Code Section 1793.2(b) is overruled. The Judge also rules that Ford's demurrer to the Fourth Cause of Action for Breach of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability is overruled, finding that the statute of limitations was tolled by Emergency Rule 9.
