And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant David Kamen in a medical malpractice case against Plaintiff Kevin McGinn. The case involves a cataract surgery performed by Defendants Peter Mendelsohn, M.D., et al. at Specialty Surgical Center. The plaintiff alleges that the procedure deviated from the standard of practice, causing pain, injury, and anxiety.

The judge sustains Defendant Kamen's demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend, finding that Plaintiff McGinn's claim for assault and battery fails as a matter of law. The judge also sustains the demurrer to Plaintiff's second cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, finding that the allegations do not support a claim of extreme and outrageous conduct.

The judge denies Defendant Kamen's motion to strike as moot, given his ruling on the demurrer. The judge orders that Plaintiff McGinn may amend his complaint within 20 days.
