And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by defendant David Kamen in a medical malpractice case. The plaintiff, Kevin McGinn, alleges that the defendants, including Dr. Peter Mendelsohn and Specialty Surgical Center, performed a cataract surgery on his right eye without his consent and that the withholding of medications before and during the procedure was beyond the scope of civilized society.

The judge agrees with the defendant that the plaintiff cannot state a claim for assault and battery because he did not allege that a substantially different procedure was performed than what he consented to. The judge also agrees that the plaintiff's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress fails as a matter of law because he did not allege extreme and outrageous conduct or that the defendant intended to cause or acted in reckless disregard of the probability of causing emotional distress.

The judge sustains the demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend and denies as moot the defendant's motion to strike.
