## English Summary:

The Judge has reviewed the information presented in this case and is inclined to grant Ally Bank's request for a default judgment against all remaining defendants (Nicholas Fuentes, Old Earl Scheib Paint and Body, and the California Department of Motor Vehicles).  The court found that Shishkin breached a car sales contract by failing to make payments and transferring ownership to the Body Shop. The Body Shop incurred liens and storage costs, and Ally Bank demanded the car back, which was refused.  

Since the defendants did not respond to the complaint, Ally Bank was able to obtain a default judgment. The Judge states that all procedural requirements for such a judgment have been met. The judgment will award Ally Bank possession of the car, damages for the unpaid balance, and attorney's fees.  Shishkin has been dismissed from the case.
