```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Palisades Roofing Company's (PRC) motion for attorneys' fees. The ruling states that PRC is not entitled to attorneys' fees under California Code of Civil Procedure section 5975, as it is not the owner of a separate interest or the homeowners' association, which are the only entities entitled to enforce CC&Rs under the Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act. The ruling also states that PRC does not raise any statute or contract entitling it to attorneys' fees, aside from section 5975, and that the American rule applies, which requires each party to bear its own attorneys' fees.
