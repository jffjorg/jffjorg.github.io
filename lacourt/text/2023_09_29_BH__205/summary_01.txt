And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Palisades Roofing Company's (PRC) motion for attorneys' fees. The ruling states that PRC is not entitled to attorneys' fees under California Code of Civil Procedure section 5975, as it is not the owner of a separate interest or the homeowners' association, which are the only entities entitled to enforce CC&Rs under the Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act. The ruling also states that PRC does not raise any statute or contract entitling it to attorneys' fees, aside from section 5975, and that the American rule applies, which requires each party to bear its own attorneys' fees.

## English Summary

The judge is denying Palisades Roofing Company’s (PRC) request for attorneys' fees.  

PRC argued it was entitled to fees because it "prevailed" in the case by successfully getting a demurrer to the complaint sustained. However, the judge ruled that PRC is not eligible for fees under the Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act (Civ. Code §5975), which only allows for fee recovery by homeowners or the homeowner's association. Since PRC is neither, it cannot recover its attorneys' fees. 

The judge also noted that the motion for attorneys' fees was premature because a formal judgment has not yet been entered.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Palisades Roofing Company's motion for attorneys' fees. The Court sustains Palisades Roofing Company's demurrer without leave to amend, but denies its motion for attorneys' fees. The Court agrees with the plaintiffs that Palisades Roofing Company is not a prevailing party in an action to enforce CC&R's, as it is not the owner of a separate interest or the homeowners' association. The Court also finds that California follows the American rule, which provides that each party to a lawsuit must bear its own attorneys' fees, unless there is a statute or contract that allows for attorneys' fees. Since Palisades Roofing Company does not raise any statute or contract entitling it to attorneys' fees, the Court denies its motion.
