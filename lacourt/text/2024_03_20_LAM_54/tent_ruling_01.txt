BACKGROUND
            
On
January 26, 2022, Plaintiff Lawrence Harris sued “Defendant Staple Center.” The
complaint arises from alleged harassment, but the allegations of the complaint
do not identify any acts of harassment.  
 
On September
27, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against
Defendant Anschutz Entertainment Group, which merely states that Plaintiff is
“now asking that the 4th amended complaint as a defended name change.” (FAC at
p.1:14-17.) The FAC contains no factual allegations. 
 
Also,
on September 27, 2023, the Court held a Case Management Conference and stated
that “[t]he Court has approved the filing of the Amended Complaint, which is
filed and entered this date.” (09/27/23 Minute Order.) 
 
On
February 9, 2024, Defendants LA Arena Company, LLC and Anschutz Entertainment
Group (“Defendants”) filed and served a demurrer to the FAC. The Court notes
that counsel’s declaration in support of the demurrer attaches a different
version of the First Amended Complaint than what was filed with the Court.
(Prouty Decl., ¶ 2; Exh. A.) The operative FAC is the FAC that was filed with
the Court on September 27, 2023. The purported First Amended Complaint attached
to the declaration of Defendants’ counsel in support of the demurrer is
unintelligible and does not allege any wrongs purportedly committed by
Defendants. If properly before the Court, the Court would find it to be uncertain
under CCP § 430.10(f).
 
The
Court’s analysis will focus on the operative FAC filed with the Court on
September 27, 2023. Defendants’ demurrer is unopposed. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
“A demurrer tests
the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law.”  (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) “[T]he court gives the complaint a reasonable
interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded.”  (Ibid.) A
demurrer accepts as true all well pleaded facts and those facts of which the
court can take judicial notice but not deductions, contentions, or conclusions
of law or fact. (Fox v. JAMDAT Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1068,
1078.) Although courts construe pleadings liberally, sufficient facts must be
alleged to support the allegations pled to survive a demurrer. (Rakestraw v.
California Physicians' Serv. (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) In ruling on a
demurrer, “[t]he complaint must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable
inferences from the facts pleaded.” (Rodas v. Spiegel (2001) 87
Cal.App.4th 513, 517.) 
 
A special
demurrer for uncertainty under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10,
subdivision (f) is disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is
so bad that defendant or plaintiff cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot
reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or
claims are directed against him or her. (Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif.,
Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)
 
Where a demurrer
is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable
possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on the plaintiff to
show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.) “If
there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause
of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman
v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245.)  
 
A. Uncertainty 
 
            The FAC is uncertain and
unintelligible. It does not allege any facts. There are no allegations as to
the wrongs allegedly committed by Defendants, when such wrongs occurred, or
whether any damages resulted. Defendants cannot determine from the FAC what
issues must be admitted or denied. 
 
 
 
 
B. Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress  
 
Defendants contend that the FAC does not plead a cause of
action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The Court agrees. 
 
“A cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional
distress exists when there is ‘(1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the
defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the
probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff’s suffering
severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of
the emotional distress by the defendant’s outrageous conduct.’ A defendant’s
conduct is ‘outrageous’ when it is so ‘extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually
tolerated in a civilized community.’ And the defendant’s conduct must be
‘intended to inflict injury or engaged in with the realization that injury will
result.’” (Hughes v. Pair (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1035, 1050-1051.) “Severe
emotional distress means emotional distress of such substantial quality or
enduring quality that no reasonable [person] in civilized society should be
expected to endure it.” (Potter v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. (1993)
6 Cal.4th 965, 1004, internal quotations omitted.) Behavior may be deemed
outrageous “if a defendant (1) abuses a relation or position which gives him
power to damage the plaintiff’s interest; (2) knows the plaintiff is
susceptible to injuries through mental distress; or (3) acts intentionally or
unreasonably with the recognition that the facts are likely to result in
illness through mental distress.” (McDaniel v. Gile (1991) 230
Cal.App.3d 363, 372.) 
 
As discussed, the FAC does not contain any factual
allegations. It does not state a cause of action for intentional infliction of
emotional distress. 
 
Defendants’ demurrer to the FAC is
SUSTAINED. The Court will give Plaintiff another opportunity to amend the
complaint to clearly identify the parties, the cause of action, and the facts in
support and, if handwritten, to ensure that the pleading is legible.
