The 2024 update to the statute applies to childhood sexual assault claims that
occurred on or after January 1, 2024. (CCP § 340.1(p).) Claims that occurred on
or before December 31, 2023 “may only be commenced pursuant to the applicable
statute of limitations set forth in existing law as it read on December 31,
2023.” (Ibid.) Here, the 2022 and
2023 versions did not change subdivision (c) pertaining to plaintiffs who are
40 years or older at the time of filing.

The court disagrees with Plaintiff’s argument that Doe and Santillan are
outdated because they analyze what “knowledge” means and the court is unaware
of authority overruling that analysis. Additionally, Plaintiff later argues
that she sufficiently pled facts to revive her claim under the knowledge
requirement. (Opp. 7:12-17.)

There are less factual allegations here than in Doe which the Court held were deficient to survive demurrer. (Doe, supra, at pp. 537 [“the statute
requires more specific allegations than were made by plaintiffs in this
case.”])

As such, the court declines to develop the remaining arguments at this time.
