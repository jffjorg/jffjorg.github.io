And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the application of the 2024 update to the statute regarding childhood sexual assault claims. The judge notes that the 2022 and 2023 versions of the statute did not change subdivision (c) pertaining to plaintiffs who are 40 years or older at the time of filing. The judge also disagrees with the plaintiff's argument that cases such as Doe and Santillan are outdated, as they analyze the concept of "knowledge" and the judge is not aware of any authority that has overturned this analysis. Furthermore, the judge notes that the current case has fewer factual allegations compared to Doe, which was held to be deficient to survive demurrer. As a result, the judge declines to develop the remaining arguments at this time.
