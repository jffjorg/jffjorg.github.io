And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant DOE 1. The demurrer was filed to challenge the sufficiency of the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint, which alleges childhood sexual assault by an employee of Defendant's Highland Park Congregation. The judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the Plaintiff has 20 days to re-file the complaint. The motion to strike was filed to strike certain paragraphs of the First Amended Complaint, but it is now moot since the demurrer has been sustained.
