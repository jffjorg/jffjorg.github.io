Significant Statements:
  - The function of a motion for summary judgment is to determine whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim.
  - A landlord who fails to follow the statutory requirements cannot deduct any portion of the security deposit.
  - The plain language of the statute does not require the notice to be issued at the end of a tenancy.
  - A tenant signing a lease is deemed to assent to all its terms, including notice of their right to an inspection.
  - Courts must avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.
  - A landlord may still recover damages for unpaid rent, repairs and cleaning provided that he proves by a preponderance of the evidence that he has suffered such damages and that the amount claimed is reasonable.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion for summary judgment filed by the cross-defendants, Nicholas Sabbagh, Sachin Tejas Bettadapur, Alexander Amir Rassouli, and Ashan Naik, and has denied the motion. The court found that there is a triable issue over whether Culver 12 LLC, the defendant, complied with Civil Code section 1950.5(f), which requires a landlord to provide notice of a tenant's right to inspect the premises before the end of the lease term. The court also found that a violation of the statute does not necessarily preclude all recovery in the cross-complaint. The court ruled that the parties must proceed to trial to determine the facts of the case.
