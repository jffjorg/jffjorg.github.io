 Case Number:  23STCV07020    Hearing Date:   August 12, 2024    Dept:  32      LYNWOOD SANTA FE, LLC,                         Plaintiff,             v.   ADVANCED LABS, INC., et    al.,                          Defendants.           Case No.:  23STCV07020   Hearing Date:  August 12, 2024        [TENTATIVE]    order RE: plaintiff’s motion to compel further    responses to requests for production, set three (CRS# 2954)                BACKGROUND             On March 30, 2023, Plaintiff Lynwood  Santa Fe, LLC filed this action against Defendants Advanced Labs, Inc. and  Advanced Nutrients Ltd. for breach of lease and breach of guaranty arising from  unpaid rent.               On May 23, 2024, Defendants filed a  cross-complaint against Plaintiff and Shaoul Levy, alleging fraud and unjust  enrichment. Defendants allege that they were fraudulently induced into signing  the commercial lease agreement by Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s manager (Levy), who  conspired with Defendants’ then-counsel, David Welch.              On June 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed  the instant motion to compel further responses to its Requests for Production,  Set Three. Defendants filed their opposition on July 30, 2024. Plaintiff filed  its reply on August 5, 2024.  LEGAL STANDARD Upon receiving responses to its discovery  requests, the propounding party may move for an order compelling further  responses if the responses are incomplete or evasive, or objections are without  merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(a), 2031.310(a),  2033.290(a).) A moving party must demonstrate good cause to compel further  responses to inspection demands. (Id., § 2031.310(b)(1).)   MEET AND CONFER A motion to compel further must be  accompanied by a meet and confer declaration demonstrating an attempt to  resolve the matter informally. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(b)(1),  2031.310(b), 2033.290(b).) The Court finds that Plaintiff has satisfied the meet  and confer requirement. (See Shanks-Parkin Decl.; Gershman Decl.) DISCUSSION I.  RFP Nos. 56 and 57             a. The Requests RFP No. 56 seeks “All DOCUMENTS related to  any investigation conducted into the subjects of Kevin Flynn [Defendants’  former president] or actions he allegedly took while working for you or any of  your predecessors, parents, subsidiaries, or affiliates.” RFP No. 57 seeks the  same documents but for Wayne Johnson, Defendants’ in-house counsel.  b. Good Cause Defendants contend that Flynn and Johnson  had no authority to enter into the lease and were bribed into doing so.  (Shanks-Parkin Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. 6, 7.) Therefore, there is good cause for the  production of these documents. The documents are relevant to disproving  Defendants’ theory of the case and concern issues raised by Defendants in their  own cross-complaint. The fact that Plaintiff denies making any bribes does not  preclude it from asking Defendants to produce documents supporting their theory  of bribery.  However, Plaintiff has not articulated  good cause for “all” investigative documents. There is no indication that  Defendants accuse Flynn and Johnson of wrongdoing beyond entering the lease  without authority and/or accepting bribes. To the extent Flynn and Johnson were  investigated for other types of wrongdoing, Plaintiff fails to articulate the  relevance of those investigations.   c. Privacy The documents are directly relevant to the  issues in the case, and Plaintiff’s need for the information outweighs the  privacy concerns. (See Williams v. Sup. Ct. (2017) 3 Cal.5th  531, 552.) Additionally, the privacy concerns are properly assuaged by a  protective order. (See Hill v. Nat’l Collegiate Athletic Assn. (1994) 7 Cal.4th  1, 38.) Therefore, Defendants’ privacy objection does not preclude the  production sought.    d. Privilege             Defendants  argue that because their prior counsel, Welch, conducted the investigations,  the investigation records are privileged under the attorney-client privilege. The  privilege covers “information transmitted between a client and his or her  lawyer in the course of that relationship and in confidence.” (Evid. Code, §  952.) “The privilege is absolute and precludes disclosure of confidential  communications even though they may be highly relevant to a dispute.” (City  of Petaluma v. Superior Court (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 1023, 1032.) However,  the privilege “does not protect disclosure of underlying facts which may be  referenced within a qualifying communication.” (State Farm Fire &  Casualty Co. v. Superior Court (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 625, 639.) “Knowledge  which is not otherwise privileged does not become so merely by being  communicated to an attorney.” (Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Superior Court  (2009) 47 Cal.4th 725, 735.)              Not all responsive documents related  to the investigations are necessarily privileged communications. To the extent  Defendants are withholding documents based on the privilege, they must provide  a privilege log with sufficient information to assess the merits of the  privilege. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.240(c)(1).)              In sum, the motion is GRANTED as to  RFP Nos. 56 and 57, limited to investigations of Flynn’s and Johnson’s actions  related to entering the lease.  II.  RFP Nos. 58-60             a. Good Cause             RFP Nos. 58-60 seek all  communications with David Welch related to the subject property, the lease  thereof, and the guaranty. There is good cause for such communications because  the lease and guaranty are the central issues in the litigation, and Defendants  allege that Welch conspired with Plaintiff to defraud Defendants.              b. Privilege             As with above, to the extent that a  privilege applies, Defendants must provide a privilege log. (See Code Civ.  Proc., § 2031.240(c)(1).) Here, the privilege would be waived to the extent  Defendants made a voluntary disclosure of the information in their cross-complaint.  (See City of Petaluma, supra, 248 Cal.App.4th at p. 1033.)              The motion is GRANTED as to RFP Nos.  58-60. CONCLUSION             Plaintiff’s motion to compel further  responses is GRANTED in part as set forth above. Defendants shall produce  further responses and privilege logs within 20 days of this order. Production  is subject to a protective order. Sanctions are denied as the parties acted  with substantial justification.       


 
LYNWOOD SANTA FE, LLC,
                        Plaintiff,
            v.

                        Defendants.



 
  Case No.:  23STCV07020
  Hearing Date:  August 12, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant advanced labs, inc.’s motion
  to compel supplemental privilege log and production of nonprivileged
  documents (CRS# 6015)  




 


 




BACKGROUND

            On March 30, 2023, Plaintiff Lynwood
Santa Fe, LLC filed this action against Defendants Advanced Labs, Inc. and
Advanced Nutrients Ltd. for breach of lease and breach of guaranty arising from
unpaid rent. 

             On May 23, 2024, Defendants filed a
cross-complaint against Plaintiff and Shaoul Levy, alleging fraud and unjust
enrichment. Defendants allege that they were fraudulently induced into signing
the commercial lease agreement by Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s manager (Levy), who
conspired with Defendants’ then-counsel, David Welch. 

            On June 13, 2024, Defendant Advanced
Labs, Inc. filed the instant motion to compel Plaintiff to produce a
supplemental privilege log and to produce responsive documents for which
Plaintiff cannot justify the privilege. Plaintiff filed its opposition on July
30, 2024. Defendant filed its reply on August 5, 2024. 

 

 

LEGAL STANDARD

            “If an objection is based on a claim
of privilege or a claim that the information sought is protected work product,
the response shall provide sufficient factual information for other parties to
evaluate the merits of that claim, including, if necessary, a privilege log.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.240(c)(1).) 

            “The precise information required
for an adequate privilege log will vary from case to case based on the
privileges asserted and the underlying circumstances. In general, however, a
privilege log typically should provide the identity and capacity of all individuals
who authored, sent, or received each allegedly privileged document, the
document's date, a brief description of the document and its contents or
subject matter sufficient to determine whether the privilege applies, and the
precise privilege or protection asserted.” (Catalina Island Yacht Club v.
Superior Court (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1130.) Although a trial court
cannot compel the production of potentially privileged information solely based
on a deficient privilege log, the court may order the respondent to provide a
supplemental privilege log. (Ibid.) 

DISCUSSION

            In its responses to Defendant’s
RFPs, Plaintiff agreed to produce all communications regarding the lease,
guaranty, and subject property, including communications with David Welch. (Lee
Decl., Ex. 2, 4.) Plaintiff also produced a privilege log identifying 141 items
withheld as privileged. (Id., Ex. 7.) Defendant contends that the log
fails to: (1) describe the documents’ contents or subject matter; (2) identify
all persons who authored, sent or received each allegedly privileged document; or
(3) specify the requests to which the allegedly privileged documents are
responsive to.    

            Plaintiff’s supplemental privilege
log sufficiently identifies the documents withheld, their nature, and the
authors and recipients. (See Shanks-Parkin Decl., Ex. 9.) The log sufficiently
describes the documents by explaining that they are communications regarding
legal advice. To compel further information would essentially require Plaintiff
to disclose the nature of the advice, defeating the purpose of the privilege.
Defendant’s own privilege log contains no such information. (Id., Ex.
6.) Defendant cites no authority for the proposition that a privilege log must
identify each discovery request to which the withheld documents respond. Again,
Defendant’s own privilege log contains no such information. (Ibid.) 

            Furthermore, Defendant cannot compel
Plaintiff to log communications that Plaintiff has not withheld based on
privilege. To the extent that Plaintiff agreed to produce all responsive
communications with Welch but has not done so, that is the subject of a
different motion. But if Plaintiff has not withheld any Welch communications
based on privilege, then those communications naturally would not appear on the
privilege log. 

Lastly, even if Plaintiff’s privilege log
is deficient, the Court cannot preemptively order production of responsive
documents, as that may result in disclosure of privileged information. (See Catalina
Island, supra, 242 Cal.App.4th at p. 1130.) 


CONCLUSION

            Defendant Advanced Labs, Inc.’s
motion to compel supplemental privilege log and further production of documents
is DENIED. Sanctions are denied as the parties acted with substantial
justification.

BACKGROUND

            On March 30, 2023, Plaintiff Lynwood
Santa Fe, LLC filed this action against Defendants Advanced Labs, Inc. and
Advanced Nutrients Ltd. for breach of lease and breach of guaranty arising from
unpaid rent. 

             On May 23, 2024, Defendants filed a
cross-complaint against Plaintiff and Shaoul Levy, alleging fraud and unjust
enrichment. Defendants allege that they were fraudulently induced into signing
the commercial lease agreement by Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s manager (Levy), who
conspired with Defendants’ then-counsel, David Welch. 

            On June 13, 2024, Defendant Advanced
Labs, Inc. filed the instant motion to compel further responses to its Requests
for Production Nos. 68, 122, and 123. Plaintiff filed its opposition on July
30, 2024. Defendant filed its reply on August 5, 2024. 

LEGAL STANDARD

Upon receiving responses to its discovery
requests, the propounding party may move for an order compelling further
responses if the responses are incomplete or evasive, or objections are without
merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(a), 2031.310(a),
2033.290(a).) A moving party must demonstrate good cause to compel further
responses to inspection demands. (Id., § 2031.310(b)(1).)  

MEET AND CONFER

A motion to compel further must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration demonstrating an attempt to
resolve the matter informally. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(b)(1),
2031.310(b), 2033.290(b).) The Court finds that Defendant has satisfied the
meet and confer requirement. (See Lee Decl.)

DISCUSSION

I.
RFP No. 68

            RFP No. 68 seeks all documents
constituting, evidencing,
memorializing, summarizing or reflecting Plaintiff’s operating agreement. In
its response, Plaintiff agreed to produce its Limited Liability Company
Agreement and its Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement. 

            While purporting to comply with the
demand, Plaintiff’s response fails to “state that the production, inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, and related activity demanded, will be allowed
either in whole or in part, and that all documents or things in the demanded
category that are in the possession, custody, or control of that party and to
which no objection is being made will be included in the production.” (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.220.) Simply identifying two documents that Plaintiff plans
to produce is not a sufficient statement of compliance. To the extent that
Plaintiff cannot comply with the request, it must respond with a proper
statement of inability to comply. (See id., § 2031.230)

            Defendant argues that Plaintiff is
withholding other responsive documents. As this is a motion to compel further
responses, not a motion to compel production, the Court does not reach the
issue of what documents are responsive or must be produced. For purposes of
this motion, Plaintiff must simply provide a proper statement of compliance or
statement of inability to comply. 

            The motion is GRANTED as to RFP No.
68.

II.
RFP Nos. 122 and 123

            RFP No. 122 seeks all documents regarding
any conflicts of interest between Welch and Levy from January 1, 2017 to
November 30, 2022. RFP No. 123 seeks all documents regarding any waiver of such
conflicts during the same time period. 

            Defendant argues that it “seeks to
ascertain whether Welch disclosed his conflicts of interest with Levy regarding
other real estate ventures, such as Maywood, Wright Road, etc.” Defendant
claims this evidence “would be admissible to show Levy knew, intended and/or
planned to defraud [Defendant].” This sufficiently demonstrates good cause for
the documents. “[E]vidence of other transactions is admissible to show motive,
intent, knowledge, plan, and absence of mistake.” (Kirkland v. Superior
Court (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.) The information sought is “(at a
minimum) reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”
(Id. at p. 97; Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.)  

Therefore, the motion is GRANTED as to RFP
Nos. 122 and 123.

CONCLUSION

            Defendant Advanced Labs, Inc.’s
motion to compel further responses to Requests for Production is GRANTED.
Plaintiff shall produce further responses within 20 days of this order.
Sanctions are denied as the parties acted with substantial justification.

BACKGROUND

            On March 30, 2023, Plaintiff Lynwood
Santa Fe, LLC filed this action against Defendants Advanced Labs, Inc. and
Advanced Nutrients Ltd. for breach of lease and breach of guaranty arising from
unpaid rent. 

             On May 23, 2024, Defendants filed a
cross-complaint against Plaintiff and Shaoul Levy, alleging fraud and unjust
enrichment. Defendants allege that they were fraudulently induced into signing
the commercial lease agreement by Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s manager (Levy), who
conspired with Defendants’ then-counsel, David Welch. 

            On June 13, 2024, Defendant Advanced
Labs, Inc. filed the instant motion to compel further responses to its Special
Interrogatories Nos. 26-31. Plaintiff filed its opposition on July 30, 2024. Defendant
filed its reply on August 5, 2024. 

LEGAL STANDARD

Upon receiving responses to its discovery
requests, the propounding party may move for an order compelling further
responses if the responses are incomplete or evasive, or objections are without
merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(a), 2031.310(a),
2033.290(a).) A moving party must demonstrate good cause to compel further
responses to inspection demands. (Id., § 2031.310(b)(1).)  

MEET AND CONFER

A motion to compel further must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration demonstrating an attempt to
resolve the matter informally. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(b)(1),
2031.310(b), 2033.290(b).) The Court finds that Defendant has satisfied the
meet and confer requirement. (See Lee Decl.)

DISCUSSION

SROG Nos. 26-31 ask Plaintiff to: (1) describe
each matter in which Welch represented Levy from January 1, 2017 to November
30, 2022; (2) for each matter, state whether Welch had a conflict of interest
with Defendants; and (3) identify anyone who signed a waiver of such conflict
on behalf of Levy or Defendants. Plaintiff objected to the SROGs as vague,
overbroad, irrelevant, and intruding privacy. 

            a. Relevance

The information sought is relevant to the
subject matter of the case or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.) The cross-complaint is
premised on the allegation that while Welch was representing Defendants, he
also partnered with Levy and failed to disclose these conflicts. Defendant is
entitled to ascertain the nature and extent of Welch’s conflicts.

            b. Breadth

The request is not overbroad. It is
properly limited to matters in which Welch represented Levy during a specified
timeframe. As discussed above, conflicts created by Welch’s representation of
Levy are proper matters for discovery. Plaintiff does not contend that the
timeframe is unreasonable or burdensome.  

c. Privacy

            Plaintiff argues that “the identity
of an attorney’s clients is sensitive personal information that implicates the
clients’ rights of privacy.” (See Hooser v. Superior Court (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th
997, 1005.) However, the SROGs only seek information on Welch’s representation
of Levy, not a list of Welch’s other clients. Moreover, Welch’s representation
of Levy has been publicly acknowledged. “Upon such public disclosure of the
attorney-client relationship, the client's privacy concerns regarding the fact
of the consultation evaporate and there is no longer a basis for preventing the
attorney from identifying the client.” (Id. at p. 1006.) In any case,
the information is directly relevant, and Defendant’s need for the information
outweighs the privacy interests. (See Williams v. Sup. Ct. (2017) 3
Cal.5th 531, 552.) 

            d. Privilege

Plaintiff argues that the SROGs implicate
the attorney-client privilege, an objection not raised its responses. “[T]he
Legislature requires objections in the initial response to written
interrogatories to avoid waiver of privilege.” (Scottsdale Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 263, 273.)

In any case, the objection is without
merit. The privilege covers communications between a lawyer and client. (Evid.
Code, § 952.) The SROGs on their face do not seek communications. Plaintiff
argues that the disclosure of Mr. Welch’s clients would reveal confidential
information. “As a general rule, the identity of an attorney's clients is not
protected by the attorney-client privilege.” (Rosso v. Superior Court
(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 1514, 1518.) Only in “unusual situations” would
disclosure of a client name “betray a confidential communication.” (Ibid.)
Plaintiff “does not make any argument that, by virtue of the nature of [Welch’s]
practice or the manner in which he solicits his clients, this limited exception
applies under the circumstances.” (See Hooser, supra, 84 Cal.App.4th at
p. 1005.) 

 

e. Typographical Error

As written, SROG Nos. 27-31 seek follow-up
information with regards to Plaintiff’s responses to SROG No. “20,” when
Defendant actually seeks information on SROG No. 26. However, Defendant
clarified this typographical error in an April 24, 2024 meet and confer letter.
(Lee Decl., Ex. 3.) Thus, Plaintiff was aware of what the SROGs sought well
before this motion was filed. Where “the nature of the information sought is
apparent, the proper solution is to provide an appropriate response,” even if “the
question is somewhat ambiguous.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d
771, 783.)     

CONCLUSION

            Defendant Advanced Labs, Inc.’s
motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories is GRANTED.
Plaintiff shall produce further responses within 20 days of this order.
Sanctions are denied as the parties acted with substantial justification.
