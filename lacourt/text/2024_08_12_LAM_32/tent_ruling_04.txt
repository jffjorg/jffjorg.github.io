     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant christopher stone’s motion for
  reconsideration 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On November 19, 2010, Plaintiff
Alyssa Backlund filed this action against Defendants Christopher Stone and
Elite Imaging Concepts, LLC, asserting causes of action for (1) defamation, (2)
false light, (3) public disclosure of private facts, (4) abuse of process, (5)
intentional infliction of emotional distress, and (6) violation of Business and
Professions Code section 17200. The complaint stems from alleged false
statements and material about Plaintiff that Defendants posted online.  
            On December 3, 2013, default
judgment was entered for Plaintiff against Defendants. The judgment was renewed
on November 28, 2023. 
            On March 12, 2024, Defendant Stone
filed a motion to vacate the renewal. The Court denied this motion on June 10,
2024. 
            On June 21, 2024, Defendant Stone
filed the instant motion for reconsideration of the Court’s denial of the
motion to vacate. Plaintiff filed her opposition on July 30, 2024. Defendant
filed his reply on August 5, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
“When an application for an order has been
made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or
granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within
10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order
and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application
to the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and
modify, amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application shall
state by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge,
what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts,
circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008(a).) 
DISCUSSION
I.
Legal Background
            Ordinarily, a complaint for recovery
of damages must state the amount demanded. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.10(a)(2).)
However, “where an action is brought to recover actual or punitive damages for
personal injury or wrongful death, the amount demanded shall not be stated.” (Id.,
§ 425.10(b).) In a personal injury or wrongful death case, the defendant may
instead demand a damages statement from the plaintiff, or if no demand is made,
the plaintiff must provide the statement before a default may be taken. (Id.,
§ 425.11(b), (c).) 
            “If a party has not appeared in the
action, the statement shall be served in the same manner as a summons.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 425.11(d)(1).) “If a party has appeared in the action, the
statement shall be served upon the party’s attorney, or upon the party if the
party has appeared without an attorney, in the manner provided for service of a
summons or in the manner provided by Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 1010)
of Title 14 of Part 2.” (Id., § 425.11(d)(2).) 
These requirements are designed “to ensure
that a defendant who declines to contest an action does not thereby subject himself
to open-ended liability.” (Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 826.)
“[A] default judgment that exceeds the demand would effectively deny a fair
hearing to the defaulting party.” (Ibid.) Therefore, “a default judgment
greater than the amount specifically demanded is void as beyond the court's
jurisdiction.” (Ibid.)  
II.
The Motion to Vacate
            Defendant moved to vacate the
renewal of judgment on the grounds that Plaintiff’s complaint failed to specify
the amount of damages as required under Code of Civil Procedure sections
425.10(a)(2) and 580(a). Defendant’s motion argued that the action does not
involve personal injury and therefore Plaintiff’s statement of damages did not
constitute proper notice of liability. As a result, Defendant argued that the
default judgment violated his due process.  
            Plaintiff opposed the motion,
arguing that the defamation, emotional distress, false light, and public
disclosure claims were personal injury torts under O'Hara v. Storer
Communications, Inc. (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1101, 1118; Globe Internat.,
Inc. v. Superior Court (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 393, 398-99; and O'Hilderbrandt
v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. (1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 323, 329.
Plaintiff therefore argued that the statement of damages constituted proper
notice of liability. Plaintiff argued that she properly served the statement on
June 26, 2013 by mailing it to the P.O. box address listed in the Substitution
of Attorney form that was filed when Defendant’s counsel withdrew. 
            In reply, Defendant argued that even
if the causes of action were based on personal injury, the statement of damages
was not served in the same manner as a summons as required under Code of Civil
Procedure section 425.11(d)(1). Specifically, Defendant argued that the statement
was not mailed with a notice and acknowledgment. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
415.30(a); Sakaguchi v. Sakaguchi (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 852, 860.) 
III.
The Court’s Order 
            In denying Defendant’s motion to
vacate, the Court agreed with Plaintiff that her causes of action were for
personal injury under O’Hara, Globe Internat., Inc., and O’Hilderbrandt.
The Court further held that Plaintiff properly served the statement of damages
under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.11(d)(2). Specifically, the Court
found that because Defendant had appeared in the lawsuit, the statement was
properly served by mail either on Defendant’s attorney of record or on
Defendant himself. At the time of service, Defendant had no attorney, thus the
Court found that service was proper at the P.O. box provided by Defendant. 
IV.
The Instant Motion
            Defendant moves for reconsideration
of the Court’s order on the following grounds: (1) the Court did not allow
Defendant to fully present his arguments at the hearing; (2) the alleged
defamation and the related emotional distress damages are not based on personal
injury; (3) Plaintiff failed to use the mandatory CIV-050 form for her
statement of damages and her custom form was not sufficiently specific; (4) the
statement was not mailed to Defendant’s address of record; and (5) the Court
incorrectly applied section 425.11.  
            a. Personal Injury
            “Defamation is rather that which
tends to injure ‘reputation’ in the popular sense; to diminish the esteem,
respect, goodwill or confidence in which the plaintiff is held, or to excite
adverse, derogatory or unpleasant feelings or opinions against him.” (O'Hara,
supra, 231 Cal.App.3d at p. 1118.) “A defamation claim thus seeks to
vindicate decidedly personal interests. As such, defamation is a personal
injury within the meaning of section 3291.” (Ibid.) 
            Agreeing with Plaintiff and O’Hara,
the Court held that Plaintiff’s claim for defamation was one for personal
injury. Defendant presents no new facts or law to justify reconsideration of
this finding. Defendant’s continued disagreement with the Court’s
interpretation is not grounds for reconsideration “[s]ince in almost all
instances, the losing party will believe that the trial court's ‘different’
interpretation of the law or facts was erroneous.” (Gilberd v. AC Transit
(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.)
 
            b. Statement of Damages Form
            Defendant argues that Plaintiff failed
to use the mandatory CIV-050 form for her statement of damages and instead used
ordinary pleading paper. Defendant relies on the requirement that “[t]he rules
pertaining to defaults and default judgments must be precisely followed to
ensure that a defaulting defendant is aware of plaintiff's claims.” (Fasuyi
v. Permatex, Inc. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 681, 691.) The court in Fasuyi
found that the multitude of defects with the plaintiff’s request for default
did not constitute precisely following the rules of default and concluded that
the default should have been set aside. (Id. at pp. 693-94.) In
particular, the request for default was not accompanied by any statement
of damages, on the mandatory form or otherwise. (Id. at p. 688.) There
was no proof of service of a statement of damages. (Id. at p. 692.)
Defendant received “only ‘a single page of an incomplete document’” and did “‘not
have a complete copy of plaintiff's statement of damages.’” (Ibid.) 
By contrast, Plaintiff filed a complete
statement of damages, with accompanying proof of service, on June 6, 2013 and
June 28, 2013, respectively. Defendant does not contend that he was served with
an incomplete form. As stated in Fasuyi, the purpose of the default
procedures is to “ensure that the defendant received sufficient notice of the
pending action to make an informed choice as to whether to defend or ignore the
plaintiff's claims.” (Fasuyi, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th at p. 691.)
Plaintiff’s statement of damages accomplished this by providing the exact same
information as the CIV-050 form. The categories of damages claimed in
Plaintiff’s statement are the exact same ones as provided in the CIV-050 form.
Plaintiff did not change the wording or description of the damages. They appear
on Plaintiff’s statement precisely as they appear on the CIV-050 form. Under
these circumstances, the Court does not find that Plaintiff failed to follow
the rules of default simply because she did not use the CIV-050 form. 
            Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s
statement “does not separate loss of consortium from general damages or loss of
future earning capacity in special damages” and is therefore not “sufficiently
specific.” (Mtn. 6:19-22.) It is unclear what Defendant means by this.
Plaintiff’s statement did not claim loss of consortium or loss of future
earning capacity. Additionally, even the CIV-050 form does not “separate loss
of consortium from general damages or loss of future earning capacity in
special damages.” 
            “Procedural due process requires “
‘that a defendant be given notice of the existence of a lawsuit and notice of
the specific relief which is sought .... The logic underlying this principle is
simple: a defendant who has been served with a lawsuit has the right, in view
of the relief which the complainant is seeking from him, to decide not to
appear and defend. However, a defendant is not in a position to make such a
decision if he or she has not been given full notice.’ ” ” (Yu v. Liberty
Surplus Ins. Corp. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 1024, 1031; Greenup v. Rodman
(1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 826 [CCP §§ 580 and 425.11 “aim to ensure that a
defendant who declines to contest an action does not thereby subject himself to
open-ended liability”].) Consistent with this principle, “a default judgment
greater than the amount specifically demanded is void as beyond the court's
jurisdiction.” (Greenup, at p. 826; CCP § 580(a) [“The relief granted to
the plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot exceed that demanded ... in the
statement [of damages] required by Section 425.11.”].)
“‘Section 425.11 has been construed to
require “a statement of both special and general damages sought [because] ...
such information aids a defendant in evaluating the validity of plaintiff's
damage claims with regard to their provability.’ ” ” (Schwab v. Southern
California Gas Co. (2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1322, disapproved on
another ground in Sass v. Cohen (2020) 10 Cal.5th 861; Schwab v.
Rondel Homes, Inc. (1991) 53 Cal.3d 428, 432.)  The statement of damages personally served on Defendant
satisfied this requirement. 
Defendant is correct that the Judicial
Council developed and approved form CIV-050 for mandatory use as a statement of
damages under section 425.11. (See, CCP § 425.12(b) [“The Judicial
Council shall develop and approve an official form for use as a statement of
damages pursuant to Sections 425.11 and 425.115.”]; Cal. Gov. Code, §
68511 [“The Judicial Council may prescribe by rule the form and content of
forms used in the courts of this state. When any such form has been so
prescribed by the Judicial Council, no court may use a different form which has
as its aim the same function as that for which the Judicial Council's
prescribed form is designed.”].) But it does not follow that Plaintiff’s
failure to use form CIV-050 means the statement of damages served on Defendant cannot
support entry of the default and default judgment, especially given the Supreme
Court's direction in Greenup, supra, 42 Cal.3d at page 827 that the
plaintiff must “ ‘give notice to the defendant of the amount of special and
general damages sought’ before obtaining a default judgment.” 
As stated previously, form CIV-050 would not
have provided Defendant with any additional detail as to the damages sought by Plaintiff.  Defendant cites no authority suggesting that
a statement of damages is defective simply because it is not written on the
Judicial Council form, even if it provides precisely the same information as
the Judicial Council form. Although the court in Fasuyi referred to the
CIV-050 form as “mandatory,” the default judgment in that case was defective
for a variety of reasons. (Fasuyi, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th at pp. 688,
692.)
The court is not persuaded that the
statement of damages personally served on Defendant in this case failed to
apprise him of the nature and amount of damages being sought or otherwise
impeded his ability to make a “ ‘fair and informed’ ” decision. (Greenup,
supra, 42 Cal.3d at p. 829.)   Therefore,
the Court finds that Plaintiff’s statement of damages was proper.  
c. Defendant’s Address
Defendant argues that the statement of
damages was improperly mailed to a P.O. box that was listed on a Substitution
of Attorney filed on April 24, 2013 when Defendant’s counsel withdrew. Defendant
contends that without a notice of change of address, his address of record at
the time was the office of his attorney. 
Defendant’s cited case law contradicts his
position. The case actually held that service at a rented mailbox was proper
because that was the only address on record at the time of service. (See Sweeting
v. Murat (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 507, 513.) Here, Defendant’s address for
service was his attorney’s office only while Defendant had an attorney. But
upon the attorney’s withdrawal, the only address provided by Defendant was the
P.O. box. Serving the statement to an attorney who no longer represented
Defendant would have been futile and improper. Thus, Plaintiff served the
statement of damages to the proper address. 
d. Mailing Under Section 425.11(d)(2)
Defendant’s argument regarding service by
mail on a pro per litigant was addressed and rejected at the hearing on the
motion to vacate. While reasserting his disagreement with the Court’s
interpretation, Defendant offers no new facts or law to justify reconsideration.
As stated above, disagreement with the Court’s interpretation is not grounds
for reconsideration “[s]ince in almost all instances, the losing party will
believe that the trial court's ‘different’ interpretation of the law or facts
was erroneous.” (Gilberd, supra, 32 Cal.App.4th at p. 1500.) As
discussed, Plaintiff properly mailed the statement of damages to Defendant’s
P.O. box. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s motion for
reconsideration is DENIED.
