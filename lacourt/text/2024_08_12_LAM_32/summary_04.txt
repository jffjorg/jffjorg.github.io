And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for reconsideration filed by Defendant Christopher Stone. The motion was filed in response to the Court's denial of his previous motion to vacate a default judgment entered against him.

The Court has determined that the default judgment was proper and that the statement of damages served on Defendant was sufficient. The Court has also rejected Defendant's arguments that the statement of damages was defective because it was not written on the Judicial Council's official form, CIV-050.

The Court has found that Plaintiff Alyssa Backlund properly served the statement of damages on Defendant, even though it was mailed to a P.O. box address rather than Defendant's attorney's office. The Court has also rejected Defendant's argument that he was not properly notified of the damages being sought.

The Court has concluded that Defendant's motion for reconsideration is denied.
