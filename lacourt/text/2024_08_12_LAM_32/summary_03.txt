  - "The SROGs only seek information on Welch's representation of Levy, not a list of Welch's other clients."
  - "Upon such public disclosure of the attorney-client relationship, the client's privacy concerns regarding the fact of the consultation evaporate and there is no longer a basis for preventing the attorney from identifying the client."

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motions to compel further responses to requests for production, set three (CRS# 2954), and to compel further responses to special interrogatories (CRS# 0982). The ruling also denies the motion to compel supplemental privilege log and production of nonprivileged documents (CRS# 6015). The court finds that the plaintiff has satisfied the meet and confer requirement and that the defendant has demonstrated good cause for the production of documents. The ruling also addresses issues of privilege, confidentiality, and relevance, and finds that the requested information is relevant and material to the case.
