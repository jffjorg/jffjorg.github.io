And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that the demurrer to the cross-complaint is sustained with leave to amend. The cross-complainants, Hootan Ataian and Pacific Stone Construction Inc., claim that the cross-defendants, Mike Rafipoor, Santa Playa Vista Panini Investments, Inc., Santa Monica Panini Investments, Inc., and San Aliso, Inc., breached a contract to pay for demolition work performed on four PKG locations. The written agreement for the work was executed on or about July 2, 2020. The judge finds that the cross-complainants' allegations are well-stated and that the written agreement constitutes a valid contract. However, the judge notes that the cross-complainants failed to allege that they are licensed contractors, as required by California Business and Professions Code section 7031. The judge grants the cross-defendants' demurrer and gives the cross-complainants 30 days to file an amended cross-complaint.
