The petitioner must also electronically file and serve supplemental papers addressing the deficiencies. The respondent, Jose Rudy Amaya and Plumbing and Industrial Supply Company, has not filed an opposition to the petition. The judge notes that the petition has several deficiencies, including a failure to specify who "Ivy Wang" is and her connection to the minor plaintiff and/or the petitioner.

The judge is giving the petitioner an opportunity to correct these deficiencies before the next hearing.
