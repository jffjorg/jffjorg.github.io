ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
On September 11, 2024, Plaintiff
Joanne Doram (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendants Experian
Information Solutions, Inc. (“Experian”), Trans Union, LLC (“Trans Union”), and
Equifax Information Services, LLC (“Equifax”) (“Defendants”) alleging a single
cause of action for Violations of California Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies
Act. (Comp., p. 1.) 
 
On October 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
Notice of Partial Settlement as to Equifax.
 
On October 25, 2024, Trans Union filed
an Answer. 
 
On November 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a second Notice of Partial Settlement as to Equifax.
 
On November 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a Demurrer to Trans Union’s Answer. No Opposition was filed. 
 
On November 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a Stipulation and Proposed Order for Electronic Service and Discovery
Reservation between Plaintiff and Trans Union (the “Stipulation”). On December
18, 2024, the Court granted the Stipulation. On January 2, 2025, the Court
signed the proposed order regarding the Stipulation.
 
On December 6, 2024, Trans Union filed
a First Amended Answer (“FAA”). 
 
On December 9, 2024, Plaintiff
dismissed Experian with prejudice. 
 
On December 10, 2024, the Court
overruled Plaintiff’s Demurrer to Trans Union’s Answer as Moot in light of the
FAA filed on December 6, 2024. (12/10/24 Order.)
 
On December 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a Notice of Demurrer and Demurrer to the FAA, which was set for January 14,
2025.
 
On December 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a Notice of Motion and Motion to File Exhibits Under Seal (the “Motion to
Seal”) attached to Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests
for Production of Documents, filed on December 24, 2024. The Court notes the
hearing on the Motion to Seal was also set for January 14, 2025. 
 
On December 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion to Compel Production of Documents (the “Motion”) and
sanctions request.
 
On January 3, 2025, Trans Union filed
an Opposition. 
 
To date, no Reply has been filed.
 
II.                
Procedural
Issues
 
As an initial matter, the Court notes
the Motion is untimely. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005.) Further, in the Notice of
Motion, Plaintiff provides two different hearing dates for the instant hearing
on the Motion. 
 
However, given the filing of the Opposition
and the Opposition’s correct date and time listed in the caption, the Court
exercises its discretion to hear the Motion on the merits. 
 
Additionally, the Court notes Trans
Union’s Opposition is untimely. However, the Court considers the arguments
raised therein. 
 
III.             
Legal
Standard 
 
Discovery Requests
 
A party must respond to requests for
production of documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.260, subd. (a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents
are directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move
for an order compelling responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (c).) The party also waives the right to make any objections,
including one based on privilege or work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§2031.300, subd. (a).) 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 94
limits discovery in limited jurisdiction actions to any combination of 35
interrogatories with no subparts, demands to produce documents, and requests
for admission with no subparts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 94, subd. (a).)
 
            Discovery
Responses
 
Parties responding to requests for
production “shall respond separately to each item or category of item by any of
the following: (1) [a] statement that the party will comply with the particular
demand … [;] (2) [a] representation that the party lacks the ability to comply
with the demand … [; or] (3) [a]n objection to the particular demand.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.210, subd. (a).)
 
Motions to Compel Further Responses 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.310, subdivision (a), provides that “[o]n receipt of a response to a
demand for inspection … the demanding party may move for an order compelling
further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the
following apply:  (1) [a] statement of
compliance with the demand is incomplete[;] (2) [a] representation of inability
to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive[; or] (3) [a]n objection in the
response is without merit or too general.” 

 
Further, a motion to compel must
comply with each of the following: “(1) The motion shall set forth specific
facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand. (2) The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040. (3) In lieu of a separate statement required under the
California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a
concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b).)
 
            Notice
of the motion must be given within 45 days of service of the verified
response, otherwise, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further
response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).) 
 
            Finally, California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345 requires
that all motions or responses involving further discovery contain a separate
statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of
factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses. (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1345, subd. (a)(3)). 
 
IV.             
Discussion
 
As an initial matter, the Court notes
that Plaintiff timely moved to compel less than 45 days from service of the
responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).) 
 
Also, the Motion shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) Plaintiff’s
counsel submitted a declaration stating that Plaintiff’s counsel sent a meet
and confer letter to Trans Union’s counsel identifying deficiencies in the
responses to Plaintiff’s requests for production. (Motion, Robenzadeh Decl., ¶
2.) The Court notes that while Plaintiff’s counsel also states a copy of this
letter is attached as “Exhibit A” to the declaration, no such document is provided.
However, Trans Union states it responded to Plaintiff’s meet and confer,
provided additional explanations regarding its responses to the requests for
production, and provided availability to “thoroughly discuss Plaintiff’s other
issues raised in the December 12, 2024 meet and confer letter and requested
Plaintiff’s counsel to propose alternative dates and times if Plaintiff’s
counsel was not available at the suggested time.” (Motion, pp. 2-3, Exh. D.) Plaintiff
did not set a time with Trans Union to further meet and confer. Additionally,
Trans Union attaches a copy of the email meet and confer thread between
Plaintiff and Trans Union. (Motion, Exh. D.) The Court finds this email
exchange insufficient to satisfy the meet and confer requirement. The parties
failed to engage in a collaborative discussion of any kind.
 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345
requires all motions or responses involving further discovery contain a
separate statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement
of factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses. (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1345, subd. (a).) Alternatively, “the court may allow the moving
party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request and each response in
dispute.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b).) The Motion is not
accompanied by a separate statement, and the Court has not allowed Plaintiff to
submit a concise outline of the dispute. Instead, the request, response, and
purported basis for ordering a further response are included in the body of the
Motion itself. Also, the Motion does not include a copy of the discovery
requests or responses. 
 
The parties are to meet and confer in
good faith and submit a joint statement of the issues remaining regarding the
documents produced by Trans Union in response to the Request for Production of Documents.
All relevant exhibits are to be attached to the joint statement.
