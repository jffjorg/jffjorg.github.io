(Compl., pp. 1, 4, 5.)                On  October 24, 2023, Petitioner Erika Wright (“Petitioner”) and minor Plaintiff filed  this action against Defendants and Does 1-100 alleging motor vehicle and  general negligence causes of action.               On  November 2, 2023, Petitioner, who is minor Plaintiff’s mother, was appointed as  minor Plaintiff’s guardian ad litem.                On  March 6, 2024, Petitioner filed an Expedited Petition for Approval of  Compromise of a Disputed Claim of Minor Claimant, Khilyn Williams (the “Expedited  Petition”).                On  March 15, 2024, the Court entered an order setting a hearing on the Expedited Petition  for April 25, 2024. (03/15/24 Order, at p. 3.) The Court noted that “CRC  7.950.5(a)(8) provides that for a petition to be eligible for expedited  approval, the total amount payable to the minor ‘and all other parties under  the proposed compromise or settlement’ must be $50,000 or less.” (03/15/24  Order, at p. 3.) The Court noted that “the Petition indicates that the  defendant has offered payment of $250,000 to Petitioner to settle claims  arising out of the same incident or accident that resulted in minor’s injury.”  (03/15/24 Order, at pp. 3-4.) As such, the Court set a hearing and ordered  counsel for minor Plaintiff and Petitioner to be present so that the Court  could “obtain further details regarding the apportionment of the total  settlement amount between Petitioner and the minor.” (03/15/24 Order, at p. 4.)  The Court ordered Petitioner to file supplemental papers addressing the  deficiencies articulated in the Court’s March 15, 2024 order at least 16 court  days before the scheduled hearing. (03/15/24 Order.)               On  April 3, 2024, counsel for Minor Plaintiff filed a declaration stating that counsel  overlooked that an expedited petition could only be used if all settlements  including those to the claimant and all  other parties needed to be $50,000 or less and instead understood that only the  settlement of the claimant needed to be $50,000 or less. (Perlstein Decl., ¶  3.) Counsel apologized for the oversight. (Perlstein Decl., ¶ 3.) Counsel  further stated that Petitioner’s case was settled and funds were fully  disbursed, including attorney fees to claimant’s counsel, in June 2023 prior to  the lawsuit being filed minor Plaintiff. (Perlstein Decl., ¶ 5.) There was no  apportionment of settlement between Petitioner and minor Plaintiff. (Perlstein  Decl., ¶ 6.) The settlements were calculated based on each party’s injuries and  medical specials. (Perlstein Decl., ¶ 6.)               On  April 25, 2024, the Court denied the Expedited Petition without prejudice,  finding counsel mistakenly filed a petition for expedited approval (see  Perlstein Decl.), and the Expedited Petition contained deficiencies. (4/25/24  Order, p. 5.) For instance, “Counsel [did] not clarif[y] why the Petition  states that Petitioner paid counsel $100,000.00 in connection with the claims  giving rise to the Petition. (03/15/24 Minute Order, at p. 4; see Petition at ¶  18(b).)” (04/25/24 Order, p. 5.)               On  November 5, 2024, Petitioner filed the instant Petition for Approval of  Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor  (the “Petition”) on behalf of minor Plaintiff, which is scheduled to be heard  on January 15th at 10:00 a.m.    II.                  Procedural  Issues    The Court notes Petitioner has failed  to give notice and to file proof of service of said notice for both the March  15, 2024 and April 25, 225 Minute Orders in this matter.   Additionally, the Proposed Order and  Order to Deposit Funds in Blocked Accounts do not list the correct courthouse  address in the caption box.   Further, the Petition and accompanying  documents oscillate between using the singular and plural form of Defendant.   Finally, the Court reminds Petitioner  to label all attachments as directed by the Petition.   III.               Legal  Standard & Discussion                Court approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s  claim. (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.;  Code of Civ. Proc., § 372.) “ ‘[W]ithout trial court approval of the proposed  compromise of the ward’s claim, the settlement cannot be valid.  [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding  [on the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’ ” (Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202  Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.) A minor, like Claimant, “shall appear either by a  guardian or conservator of the estate or by a guardian ad litem appointed by  the court in which the action or proceeding is pending, or by a judge thereof,  in each case.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 372, subd. (a)(1).) Alternatively, the  petitioner may file a declaration demonstrating that he or she has a right to  compromise the minor’s claim under California Probate Code section 3500.                Regarding the substance of the  Petition, to obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the  petitioner must file a complete and  “verified petition for approval of the settlement and must disclose ‘all  information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise.’ ”  (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co. (2013)  217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256, italics added; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)                 The Court finds the following  deficiencies with the instant Petition:   ¶ 3: Petitioner  indicates the current proceeding is a pending action at Stanley Mosk  Courthouse. The instant action is being heard at Spring Street Courthouse.   ¶ 10(c): Petitioner  states the balance of the proceeds will “not be made available until Ivy Wang  attains the age of 18 years old.” The Petition does not state who “Ivy Wang” is  or her connection to minor Plaintiff and/or Petitioner. Further, the Proposed Order  and Order to Deposit Funds in Blocked Account state the balance of the proceeds  in the blocked account belong to minor Plaintiff, and withdrawal  of the proceeds may only occur when minor Plaintiff reaches 18 years of age.  (Proposed Order, ¶ 9(c)(2); Order to Deposit Funds, ¶ 5(b).) This appears  erroneous and the Moving Party is ordered to file a corrected Petition prior to  the next hearing.    As to the  Proposed Order, ¶ 8(a)(5) does not have a marked box even though a value is  listed.   No proof  of service was filed demonstrating Defendant was served with this Petition,  Proposed Order, Order to Deposit Funds in Blocked Account, or notice of  hearing.    The Petition is CONTINUED due to the  deficiencies listed.    IV.               Conclusion  & Order   The  Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of  Proceeds of Judgment for Minor is CONTINUED to FEBRUARY 19, 2025, at  10:00 a.mg. in Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse, to allow the Petitioner  to correct the deficiencies identified by the Court, and to electronically file and serve supplemental papers  addressing said deficiencies as to the Petition listed herein.     Moving  party is ordered to give notice.
