ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On April 10, 2024,
Plaintiff German Otamendi (“Plaintiff”),
proceeding pro per, filed an action against Defendant City of Los Angeles
erroneously named and served as LAPD
Central 251-6th St. Downtown LA (“Defendant”). 
 
On September 18, 2024, the
Court sustained with 20 days leave to amend Defendant’s demurrer to the
Complaint, filed on August 6, 2024. (9/18/24 Order.)
 
On
September 19, 2024, Defendant filed Notice of the September 18, 2024 ruling on
the demurrer. 
 
On
November 7, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Dismiss Defendant City
of Los Angeles Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision
(f)(2) (the “Motion”). 
 
To date, no Opposition to
the Motion has been filed. 
 
II.                
Legal
Standard & Discussion
 
Code of Civil Procedure, section 581,
subdivision (f)(2) provides that upon motion of any party, the Court may
dismiss the Complaint when a defendant’s demurrer is sustained with leave to
amend and the plaintiff fails to amend the pleading within the time allowed by
the court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 581, subd. (f)(2).) 
 
Here, more than 20 days has passed
since the ruling sustaining the Demurrer to the Complaint with leave to amend,
and Plaintiff has not filed an Amended Complaint. As Plaintiff has neither
filed an Amended Complaint nor an Opposition to the instant Motion to date,
Defendant’s request to dismiss the Complaint is granted with prejudice. “The failure to amend … is an
admission that plaintiff has state the case as strongly as he can and there are
no facts that could be alleged to cure the defect.” (Cano v. Glover (2006)
143 Cal.App.4th 326, 329-330.)
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion is
GRANTED.
 
III.             
Conclusion
& Order
 
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant City of Los Angeles erroneously
named and served as LAPD Central
251-6th St. Downtown LA’s Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED. Plaintiff German
Otamendi’s Complaint is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
 
The Non-Jury Trial scheduled for 10/08/2025 is advanced
to this date and hereby taken off calendar/vacated. 
 
Judicial Assistant is directed to give notice.
