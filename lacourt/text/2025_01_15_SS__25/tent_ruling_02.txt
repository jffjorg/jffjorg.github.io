ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On February 3, 2023,
Plaintiff Aspire General Insurance
Company (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendant Jose Cruz
(“Defendant”) alleging a single cause of action for Automobile Subrogation.
(Compl., pp. 1, 3.) 
 
Defendant, proceeding pro
per, filed an Answer on March 29, 2023. 
 
On December 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion to Deem Admitted the First Set of Request for Admissions
(“RFAs”) Served on Defendant Jose Cruz and Request for Sanctions (the “RFAs Motion”),
and the instant Motion to Compel Answers to Form Interrogatories Served on Carl
Nunn and Request for Sanctions (the “ROGs Motion”) (collectively, the
“Motions”). 
 
No Oppositions were filed. 
 
On January 9, 2025, the Court
continued the hearing on the RFAs Motion, on the Court’s own motion, from
January 9, 2025 to January 15, 2025, due to the lack of appearance or
communication by or for any Party on that date. (1/9/25 Order.)
 
II.                
Procedural
Issues
 
The Court notes a discrepancy in the
ROGs Motion – namely, the ROGs Motion’s title includes reference to a “Carl
Nunn,” who is neither the Defendant nor another identified party to this
action. 
 
Given that the remainder of the ROGs Motion,
the Proposed Order, and all accompanying documents refer to Defendant, the
Court exercises its discretion to find the title of the ROGs Motion to be a typographical
error and addresses the ROGs Motion on the merits as to Defendant. 
 
III.             
Legal
Standard 
 
A party must respond to
interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260,
subd. (a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed does not provide
timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order compelling
responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) The party
also waives the right to make any objections, including one based on privilege
or work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) There is
no time limit for a motion to compel responses to interrogatories other than
the cut-off on hearing discovery motions 15 days before trial. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2024.020, subd. (a), 2030.290.) No meet and confer efforts are required
before filing a motion to compel responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)
A party must respond to requests for
admissions within 30 days after service of such requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.250, subd. (a).)  “If a party to
whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response…(a)
[that party] waives any objection to the requests, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (a).) “The requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of
any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 94
limits discovery in limited jurisdiction actions to any combination of 35
interrogatories with no subparts, demands to produce documents, and requests
for admission with no subparts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 94, subd. (a).)
 
IV.             
Discussion

 
Plaintiff contends that Defendant
failed to timely respond to the Form Interrogatories and Request for
Admissions, on or by the statutory deadline.
 
As an initial matter, the Court notes
Plaintiff propounded 13 Requests for Admission and 20 Form Interrogatories on
Defendant, totaling 33 requests. Accordingly, the Court finds the discovery
requests served on Defendant are in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure
section 94.
 
Here, Plaintiff’s counsel’s office
served Defendant by mail on August 13, 2024 with the RFAs and Form
Interrogatories. (RFAs Motion, Tapper Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. A; ROGs Motion, Tapper
Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. A.) By September 18, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel had received no
response; on September 20, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a letter to Defendant
requesting responses to the RFAs and Form Interrogatories and offering to grant
Defendant an extension to avoid bringing a motion. (RFAs Motion, Tapper Decl., ¶
3, Exh. B; ROGs Motion, Tapper Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, Exh. B.) 
 
As of the date these Motions were
filed, December 6, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel had not received any responses. (Motions,
Tapper Decl., ¶ 5.) 
 
Thus, Plaintiff is entitled to an
order deeming RFAs admitted and compelling Defendant to provide responses
without objections to the Form Interrogatories. 
 
A.    Sanctions
 
Sanctions are
mandatory against the party, the person, or the attorney whose failure to serve
a timely response to the request necessitated the motion to deem request for
admissions as admitted and the motion to compel responses to interrogatories.
(See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(c), 2033.280(c); see also Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1348(a) [the court can award sanctions under the Discovery Act in
favor of a party seeking to compel discovery even though no opposition was
filed, the opposition was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to
the moving party after the motion was filed].)
“A request for a
sanction shall, in the notice of motion, identify every person, party, and
attorney against whom the sanction is sought, and specify the type of sanction
sought. The notice of motion shall be supported by a memorandum of points and
authorities, and accompanied by a declaration setting forth facts supporting
the amount of any monetary sanction sought.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.040.) 
 
Here, Defendant failed to serve timely
responses to Plaintiff’s RFAs and Form Interrogatories by the statutory
deadline. Thus, sanctions are mandatory against Defendant. (See Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(c), 2033.280(c); see also Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1348(a).)
 
The Court finds
Plaintiff’s Notice of Motion for each motion complies with Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.040. 
 
Plaintiff
requests monetary sanctions of $2,330.00, based on $1,165.00 for each motion,
reflecting 2 hours incurred on bringing each Motion and 3 hours incurred
traveling to and attending the Motion hearing for each Motion at an hourly rate
of $225.00 per hour, plus the $40.00 filing fee for each Motion. (Motions, Tapper Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
Given the similarity of the motions to
each other, the shared hearing date, the lack of Oppositions and Replies,
and the straightforward nature of the Motions, Plaintiff’s request for monetary
sanctions against Defendant is GRANTED in the reduced total amount of $867.50,
reflecting 3.5 hours incurred at $225.00 per hour plus $80.00 in filing fees. 
 
V.

Motion to Deem Request for Admissions Admitted and unopposed Motion to
