ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On February 15, 2024, Plaintiff Dianne
Smith (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendants Bertha Peraza aka Bertha
Ramirez (“Ramirez”), Eileen Peraza (“Peraza”), and Andrea Ramos (“Ramos”)
(collectively “Defendants”) and Does 1-10, alleging a single cause of action
for Fraudulent Transfer of Real Property by Judgment Debtor. (Compl., p. 1.) 
 
On February 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”). 
 
On March 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed
proof of personal service of the FAC and Notice of Case Assignment on Ramirez
on March 5, 2024 and on Peraza and Ramos on March 6, 2024.
 
On April 16, 2024, default was entered
against Defendants.  
 
On July 18, 2024, a default judgment
of $23,680.99 was entered against Defendants, reflecting damages, prejudgment
interest at the annual rate of 10 percent, and costs. (7/18/24 Default
Judgment.) 
 
On December 3, 2024, Peraza and Ramos,
in pro per, filed the instant “Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment and Stay
Collection Proceedings” (the “Motion”) and Request for Judicial Notice.
 
On December 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed
an Opposition.
 
No Reply has been filed.
 
On January 9, 2025, the Court continued
the hearing on the Motion from January 9, 2025 to January 15, 2025 due to the
unavailability of a Spanish language interpreter to assist Ramos. (1/9/25
Order.) 
 
II.                
Procedural
Issues
 
As an initial matter, the Court notes Peraza
and Ramos gave Plaintiff improper notice of this hearing by failing to include
the Court’s address in the Notice of Hearing.
 
Further, the proof of service for the
Motion is defective. The proof of service filed on December 16, 2024 states
service was completed on Plaintiff by a person “over 18 years of age and not
a party to this action.” (12/16/24 Proof of Service, ¶ 1.) However, Ramos,
a party to the action, declared to effecting service. (12/16/24 Proof of
Service, p. 2.) 
 
While service was improper, the Court exercises
its discretion to hear the Motion on the merits given Plaintiff’s timely-filed
Opposition and the appropriate Court address listed in the reservation receipt
attached to the Motion. 
 
III.             
Request
for Judicial Notice
 
In conjunction with the Motion, Peraza
and Ramos request judicial notice of the following files: (1) the court order
in Case No. 03K02991 confirming Gustavo Peraza did not hold personal ownership
of the subject property; (2) correspondence dated “8/14/25” misleading Peraza
and Ramos to believe they had until the 2025 to respond to the claims; (3) service
documentation; and (4) a bank statement showing the removal of $1,700 from
Peraza’s account following the Writ of Execution on August 12, 2024. (Judicial
Notice Request, Exhs. A-D.) 
 
After reviewing the moving papers, the
Court GRANTS Peraza and Ramos’ request as to the Letter of Administration in
Case No. 03K02991 and the 2020 Third Amended Standing Order (Judicial Notice
Request, Exhs. A, B). The remainder of the request is DENIED.
 
IV.             
Legal
Standard & Discussion
 
A.   
Moving Party
Position
 
Peraza and Ramos contend the default
judgment is void pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision
(d) due to “a fundamental misunderstanding of property ownership.” (Motion, p.
6.) Namely, the property in dispute was “part of an estate being administered
by Gustavo Peraza, not owned by him or the Defendants.” (Motion, p. 6.)
Further, Peraza and Ramos challenge the 2013 service of process of Gustavo
Peraza in Case No. 03K02991, which is case from which the instant dispute
arose. (Motion, p. 5.) Peraza and Ramos contend excusable neglect also warrants
relief – specifically, Peraza and Ramos’s inability to respond was due to
“misinformation about deadlines and the significant challenges posed by
Defendant Bertha Peraza’s terminal illness and subsequent death.” (Motion, p.
6.) Finally, Peraza and Ramos contends the default judgment violates due
process. (Motion, p. 6.) 
 
Additionally, Peraza and Ramos request
that “all collection proceedings, including enforcement of the Writ of
Execution, be stayed pending resolution of this motion” to prevent irreparable
harm to Peraza, “whose funds have already been wrongfully removed, and to
ensure fairness in the proceedings.” (Motion, p. 7, citing Code Civ. Proc., §
918.) 
 
 
B.     Opposition
 
In Opposition, Plaintiff argues
service of the FAC was done in conformance with code requirements. (Opp., p. 4.)
Indeed, Peraza and Ramos were personally served in March 2024. (Opp., p. 4.) Plaintiff
further states the “Affidavit of Non-Receipt of Documents” presented by Peraza
and Ramos is meaningless as it does pertain to the service effected in the
instant matter. (Opp., pp. 4-5.) 
 
Turning to Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (b), Plaintiff contends the Motion is time-barred
under the statute because Peraza and Ramos seek relief from default judgment
more than six months after default was entered against them. (Opp., p. 5.) Even
if the Motion was not time-barred, Plaintiff asserts Peraza and Ramos fail to
demonstrate excusable neglect on the grounds they misunderstood case deadlines because
a “reasonably prudent person would seek legal assistance when served with a
summons and complaint and there are numerous free legal aid services available
for such assistance.” (Opp., p. 6.) 
 
Regarding Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (d), Plaintiff argues the Motion’s argument under this
code section fail because “there is nothing in the record or on the face of the
default judgment in this case that would render it void on its face, nor do the
defendants argue it is void on its face.” (Opp., p. 6.) To the extent Peraza
and Ramos challenge service on Gustavo Peraza in 2013, Plaintiff argues this is
irrelevant as 2013 is merely when the judgment entered in 2003 was renewed.
(Opp., p. 7.) 
 
Finally, Plaintiff makes two requests
of the Court in the event the Motion is granted: (1) the Court should require a
bond from Peraza and Ramos, and (2) the Court should award $1,000 to Plaintiff
for attorney fees incurred in preparing and submitting the default package and
appearing and opposing the Motion. (Opp., pp. 7-9.) 
 
Glenn A. Besnyl, Attorney for National
Commercial Recovery, Inc., insurer for Plaintiff, refers to a Declaration in
the Opposition; however, no declaration is attached substantiating an award of
$1,000. 
 
C.     Analysis 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (d)
 
“The court may, upon motion of the injured party, or its own motion,
correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders as entered, so as to
conform to the judgment or order directed, and may, on motion
of either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment
or order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (d), emphasis added.)¿
 
An order is considered “void on
its face only when the invalidity is apparent from an inspection of the
judgment roll or court record without consideration of
extrinsic evidence.” (Pittman v. Beck Park Apartments Ltd. (2018)
20 Cal.App.5th 1009, 1021.)¿ “There is no time limit to attack a judgment
void on its face.” (Ibid.) However, if “the invalidity is not apparent
[by an inspection of the judgment or the judgment roll], it may be set aside by
motion, if such motion is filed within a reasonable time, i. e., not longer
than the time set forth in Code of Civil Procedure, section 473.” (City of
Los Angeles v. Morgan (1951) 105 Cal.App.2d 726, 730.) Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, subdivision (d) contains no express time limit, and the
California Supreme Court recently abrogated the rule that Section 473,
subdivision (d) is subject to the two-year limit set forth in Code of Civil
Procedure section 473.5. (California Capital Ins. Co. v. Hoehn (2024) 17
Cal.5th 207, 225-226 [“We hold that a section 473(d) motion to vacate a
judgment that is void for lack of proper service is not subject to the
judicially imposed two-year limitation”].)  
 
In the context of a default
judgment, Code of Civil Procedure section 670 subdivision (a) defines the
“judgment roll” as the following papers, without being attached together:
“[T]he summons, with the affidavit or proof of service;¿the complaint;¿the request
for entry of default with a memorandum indorsed thereon that the default
of the defendant in not answering was entered, and a copy of the
judgment.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 670, subd. (a).)
 
Here, the Court finds the Motion
timely. However, the
default judgment is not void on its face after a review of the judgment roll,
and the Motion does not present any intelligible challenge to service of the
summons and complaint or the face of the default judgment in this matter.
The Motion’s sole arguments as to voidness of the judgment appear to be that the
2013 service of process on Gustavo Peraza was improper in Case No. 03K02991 and
that Plaintiff’s claims rest on a “fundamental misunderstanding of property
ownership.” (Motion, pp. 5, 6.) 
 
The Court finds these contentions
are either irrelevant to the instant proceedings or are challenges to subject
matter jurisdiction that raise only general legal principles or defenses, and
thus fail to allege grounds for vacating a default judgment.
 
Accordingly, Peraza and Ramos are
not entitled to relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision
(d).
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (b)
 
The court has broad discretion to
vacate the entry of default, default judgment, or a dismissal where the moving
party timely establishes a proper ground for relief. (Cruz v. Fagor America,
Inc. (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 488, 495.) 
Code of Civil Procedure § 473, subdivision (b) contains two distinct
provisions for relief from default.  The
first provision is discretionary and broad in scope, providing: “The court may,
upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal
representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken
against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.  Application for this
relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed
to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall
be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the
judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) 
 
The Motion states that Peraza and
Ramos mistakenly thought they did not need to take action on the instant matter
until August 2025 due to a misinterpretation of a 2020 Third Amended Standing
Order they received. (Motion, p. 6, Exh. B.) The Motion further states the
Defendants believe they have a meritorious case because Peraza and Ramos
neither hold any ownership interest of the property in dispute nor participated
in the alleged fraudulent transfer. (Motion, p. 5.) 
 
The general underlying purpose of
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) is to promote the
determination of actions on their merits. 
(Even Zohar Const. & Remodeling, Inc. v. Bellaire Townhouses, LLC
(2015) 61 Cal.4th 830, 838-839.)  
 
Here, Peraza and Ramos seek
relief under the discretionary provision of Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (b) for mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect
by a party. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) 
 
Peraza and Ramos seek relief less
than six months after entry of default judgment. Default judgment was entered
on July 18, 2024, and the instant Motion was filed on December 3, 2024. 
 
However, Peraza and Ramos failed
to attach a copy of a proposed pleading. 
 
Accordingly, Peraza and Ramos are
entitled to relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).
However, the Court cannot grant relief until Defendants have file a proposed
responsive pleading. 
 
Thus, the Court CONTINUES the
matter to allow Peraza and Ramos an opportunity to file a proposed responsive
pleading prior to the next hearing date.
