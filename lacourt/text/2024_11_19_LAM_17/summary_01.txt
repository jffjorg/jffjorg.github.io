Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the cross-defendants' motion to compel compliance with the discovery agreement. Southern Motion, Inc. (SM) had agreed to provide supplemental responses to the cross-defendants' requests for production of documents, but failed to do so. Despite multiple emails and requests, SM did not provide the requested information. The court finds that SM's failure to comply with the discovery agreement warrants a sanction. Therefore, SM is ordered to pay $7,000 in sanctions, jointly and severally with its counsel. The court also orders SM to comply with the discovery agreement and provide the requested information.
