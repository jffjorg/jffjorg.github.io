And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant's motion to strike is granted. The plaintiff's complaint does not set forth sufficient allegations to support extraordinary damages for pain and suffering or punitive damages. The court finds that the plaintiff's claims sound in negligence, and therefore, the plaintiff has not alleged any facts that could show intentional malfeasance or bad faith. The court cites Branch v. Homefed Bank and Ragland v. U.S. Bank National Assn. to support its ruling.
