And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition for court approval of a minor's compromise and has granted the petition. The minor claimant, Milena Abrahamyan, seeks court approval for a settlement of $10,000 out of a total settlement of $410,000 with defendants Jacob Frederick Davidson, CBS Corporation, and CBS Studios Inc. The settlement will be deducted from the total settlement amount after attorneys' fees, litigation costs, and medical bills are paid. The court finds the settlement fair in light of the alleged injuries sustained by the claimant and finds the attorneys' fees and costs to be reasonable. The settlement funds will be placed in a blocked account. The court notes that the statute and rules of court do not contemplate a noticed motion and adversary hearing for court approval of a minor's compromise, and therefore, the court has decided the matter ex parte.
