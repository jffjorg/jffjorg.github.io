Hearing Date: December 13, 2024
Department 54, Judge Maurice A. Leiter
Petition for Minor’s Compromise
Moving Party: Minor Plaintiff Milena Abrahamyan
Responding Party: None
 
T/R:     THE PETITION IS GRANTED.
 
PLAINTIFFS TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing. 
 
The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received.
 
Compromises of disputed claims brought by
minors are governed in part by CCP § 372. The statute allows a guardian ad
litem to appear in court on behalf of a minor claimant and gives the guardian
ad litem the power to compromise the minor’s claim “with the approval of the
court in which the action or proceeding is pending.”  A petition for court approval of a compromise
must be verified by the petitioner and must contain a full disclosure of all
information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise or
covenant.  (CRC Rule 7.950.)
 
CRC Rule 7.952(a) requires the
attendance of the petitioner and claimant at the hearing on the compromise of
the claim unless the court for good causes dispenses with their personal
appearance.
 
“Neither section 372 nor the California
Rules of Court (rules 7.950 & 7.952) contemplates a noticed motion and
adversary hearing when court approval of a minor's compromise is sought.
Although we need not decide the question, it would appear that a petition to
approve or disapprove a minor's compromise may be decided by the superior
court, ex parte, in chambers.”  (Pearson
v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal. App. 4th 1333, 1337.)  
 
Petitioner seeks court approval for a
settlement from Defendants Jacob Frederick Davidson, CBS
Corporation and CBS Studios Inc. under
which the minor claimant would receive $10,000.00 out of a total settlement of
$410,000.00. $2,500.00 in attorneys’ fees, $589.00 in litigation costs
and $271.58 in medical bills
will be deducted from the minor claimants’ settlement amounts for a net
settlement for $6,639.39.
The settlement funds will be placed in a blocked account.
 
This is a personal injury action
arising from a motor vehicle accident. Having reviewed the petition, the Court
finds that the individual settlement fair in light alleged injuries sustained
by claimant. The Court finds attorney’s fees and costs to be reasonable. 
 
The petition is GRANTED.
