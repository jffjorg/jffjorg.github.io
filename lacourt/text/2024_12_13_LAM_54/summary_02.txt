```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendants' motion to bifurcate the trial between the underlying tort claims and the joint venture and alter ego theories of liability. The defendants argued that the court should determine whether the defendants are in a joint venture or are alter egos of each other after the jury determines the tort claims. However, the court found that bifurcation is unnecessary because the evidence of joint venture liability will significantly overlap with evidence of alter ego, limiting any benefits of bifurcation. The court also noted that the plaintiff is entitled to a jury trial on the joint venture theory of liability.
