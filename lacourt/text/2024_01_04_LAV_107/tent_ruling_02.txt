& rest breaks; 2) failure to pay overtime wages; 3) failure to furnish
accurate itemized wage statements; 4) waiting time penalties in violation of
Labor Code sections 201, 202, and 203; 5) failure to timely produce personnel
& payroll records; and 6) unfair competition in violation of Business

MOVING PARTY POSITION
 
Plaintiff seeks for the Court to enforce the
parties Confidential Settlement Agreement and Release (“Settlement Agreement”) pursuant
to CCP § 664.6. Plaintiff argues that because Defendant failed to tender the second
payment pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Plaintiff is entitled to seek an
enforcement under § 664.6. Plaintiff seeks a judgment awarding Plaintiff the outstanding
balance of $45,000.00.  
 
OPPOSITION
 
            Defendant
does not dispute the facts alleged in Plaintiff’s motion. Defendant asks the
Court to deny the motion due to the hardships it has faced since signing the
Settlement Agreement, including a plant fire, multiple inspections by the
Health Department, and the resignation of its CEO. 
 
REPLY
 
            No
reply has been filed.
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.              
Legal Standard

Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 (“CCP
section 664.6”) states: “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a).) For purposes of the
statute, “a writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any of the
following [among other individuals]: (1) ¶ The party. (2) ¶ An attorney who
represents the party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b).) 
 
“On a motion to enforce, the court must
determine whether the settlement agreement is valid and binding. [Citation.]
The court assesses whether the material terms of the settlement were reasonably
well-defined and certain, and whether the parties expressly acknowledged that
they understood and agreed to be bound by those terms. [In re Marriage of
Assemi (1994) 7 Cal. 4th 896, 911.]” (Estate of Jones (2022) 82
Cal.App.5th 948, 952.) 
 
The court may interpret the terms and
conditions of a settlement (Fiore v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561,
566), but the court may not create material terms of a settlement, as opposed
to deciding what terms the parties themselves have previously agreed upon (Weddington
Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 810). 
 
II.                    Discussion

 
The Court finds the agreement to be valid and
enforceable under CCP § 664.6. Plaintiff provides evidence that both parties
consented to be bound by the Settlement Agreement, which is signed by Plaintiff
and by Defendant through its CEO. (Id.) The Settlement Agreement became
fully executed on August 23, 2023. (Mirzaie Decl. ¶3; Exh. 1, “Settlement
Agreement”.) In it, Defendant agreed to pay Plaintiff $60,000.00 in four (4)
monthly installments of $15,000.00 starting thirty days from the date of
execution of the Settlement Agreement. (Settlement Agreement ¶2.)  The agreement was reached while in pending
litigation. 
 
Plaintiff requests that a judgment of the sum
of $45,000.00, corresponding to Defendant’s remaining payment balance under the
Settlement Agreement, be entered against Defendant. The relevant facts here are
that Defendant requested, and was granted by Plaintiff, two extensions to pay
the second installment, and offered to bundle payment of the second and third installments.
Nonetheless, Plaintiff did not receive any payment after the initial
installment, despite following up multiple times with defense counsel. (Id.,
¶6-7; Exh. 2.) The Settlement Agreement provides remedies in the event of
breach only if Plaintiff breaches the agreement. (Id., ¶12.) No
provisions are made for Defendant’s breach. 
 
Because the Agreement is valid and
enforceable under CCP § 664.6, and Plaintiff has pled enough facts to allege
breach, which is not contested by Defendant, the Court enters judgment for
Plaintiff in the amount of $45,000.00, to be paid by Defendant.
                        
III.       Conclusion

 
            Motion
is GRANTED and judgment is entered for Plaintiff and against Defendant for $45,000.00.

 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
