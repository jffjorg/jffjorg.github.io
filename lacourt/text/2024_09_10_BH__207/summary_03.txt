  - "The only issue before the court is whether an agreement exists; not whether the agreement has been breached."
  - "The Court declines to enter the stipulated judgment as drafted, and Westlake has not provided any authority for the Court to enter the stipulated judgment under Section 664.6 in favor of non-parties, such as Midway."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to enforce a settlement agreement between Westlake Flooring Company, LLC and Whittington Motor Sports, Inc. The settlement agreement provides for a repayment plan and the delivery of collateral to secure the debt. The judge notes that the parties have stipulated for the court to retain jurisdiction to enforce the settlement, but the court lacks authority to enter a stipulated judgment in favor of non-parties. The judge denies the motion to enforce the settlement agreement without prejudice, and orders Westlake to provide notice of the ruling and file the notice with a proof of service.
