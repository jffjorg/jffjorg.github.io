And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted in part a motion to compel documents from Crave LA LLC, a catering company, which was served a deposition subpoena requesting production of business records. The subpoena was issued as part of a lawsuit alleging that the defendants, including Liveone, Inc. and Podcastone, Inc., operated a commercial office, business event center, professional podcast interview and music recording studio in a residential area of Beverly Hills in violation of the city's zoning laws. Crave LA LLC did not formally respond to the subpoena or verify that it does not have any responsive documents. The judge has ordered Crave LA LLC to comply with the subpoena within 30 days of notice of the court's order. The judge has also denied the plaintiffs' request for monetary sanctions against Crave LA LLC and has denied their request for sanctions for misuse of the discovery process.
