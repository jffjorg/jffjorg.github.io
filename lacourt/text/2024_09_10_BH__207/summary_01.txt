And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Mark W. Huston, Esq. (counsel for Cross-Defendant Sara Soleimany) to be relieved as counsel. The motion is unopposed, but it is procedurally defective because counsel failed to properly serve notice on AIM Development, Inc. (one of the defendants). As a result, the court denies the motion without prejudice on procedural grounds. The court finds that the motion complies with the Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 1.16(b)(4), which allows a lawyer to withdraw from representation when the attorney-client relationship has broken down. The court orders counsel to provide notice of the ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
