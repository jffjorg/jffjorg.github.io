MOTION
 
Plaintiff Westlake Flooring
Company, LLC d/b/a Westlake Flooring Services moves to enforce a settlement
agreement purportedly entered into with Defendants Whittington Motor Sports,
Inc. d/b/a Wires Only and RD William Whittington.  The motion is unopposed.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
664.6 provides that “[i]f parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the
court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may
enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
664.6.) In ruling on a motion to enter judgment, the court acts as a trier of
fact. The court must determine whether the parties entered into a valid and
binding settlement. To do so, the court may receive oral testimony in addition
to declarations. (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby, Inc. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1530,
1533.)
 
This litigation is no longer
“pending,” as a dismissal was entered at Plaintiff’s request, on April 9,
2024.  However, the Court may retain
jurisdiction to enforce the settlement if the parties request it prior to the
entry of dismissal.  (See Ironridge
Global IV, Ltd. v. ScripsAmerica, Inc. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 259, 267; Sayta
v. Chu (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 960, 964.) 
Here, the Court granted the parties’ stipulation for the Court to retain
jurisdiction on March 21, 2024.  
 
The issue on a motion to enforce
settlement agreement under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 is whether the
parties entered into a valid and binding settlement agreement. (See Viejo v.
Bancorp. (1989) 217 Cal.App.3d 200, 209, fn. 4 [“a court's power to make
factual determinations under section 664.6 is generally limited to whether the
parties entered into a valid and binding settlement agreement”].)  In other words, the only issue before the
court is whether an agreement exists; not whether the agreement has been
breached.
 
Attached as Exhibit 1 to the
Declaration of Jonathan Zhan is a fully executed forbearance agreement
acknowledging that as of January 25, 2024, (1) Defendants Whittington Motor
Sports, Inc. dba Wires Only (“Wires Only”) and RD William Whittington
(“Whittington”) (together, “Debtors”) owed non-party to this litigation, Midway
Rent A Car, Inc. dba Midway Leasing and HFC Acceptance LLC dba Midway HFCA LLC
(together, “Midway”); and Plaintiff Westlake Flooring Company, LLC dba Westlake
Flooring Services (“Westlake”) $1,395,490.45 in connection with the four leased
vehicles listed in Exhibit A to the forbearance agreement; and (2) Wires Only separately
owes Westlake an additional $504,622.25 in connection with a promissory note and
loan and security agreement, for a total outstanding amount Debtors owe of
$1,900,112.70.  
 
In exchange for Midway and Westlake’s
agreement to forbear immediate collection of the full amount owed, Debtors
agreed to the repayment plan as outlined in Exhibit B to the forbearance
agreement.  The forbearance agreement
further provides that Debtors will provide as collateral the Art Collection
described in Exhibit C to the forbearance agreement with a value of $447,000
and stock in West Coast Cigarette, Inc. valued at $4,957,157, to be returned to
Debtors upon full repayment of the outstanding amounts owed.  Debtors were further required to deliver
possession of the Mercedes Metris van or pay off that vehicle in the amount of
$188,029.10, within five days of the execution of the forbearance agreement.
 
The parties further agreed to the
execution of the stipulated judgment, attached as Exhibit D to the forbearance
agreement, in favor of Plaintiff Westlake and non-party Midway and against
Debtors, jointly and severally, for the full outstanding amount of
$1,900,112.70.  
 
The agreement further provides, “Debtors further waive their right
to notice of any court hearings necessary to enter the Stipulated Judgment in
any such lawsuit and waive their right to appeal entry of the Stipulated
Judgment in any such lawsuit.”
 
In the event of default, the
forbearance agreement provides creditors shall provide 15 calendar days for
debtors to cure, following written notice, and may thereafter move to enforce
the forbearance agreement and/or file the stipulated judgment to be entered as
a final judgment.  The Court notes that
because Midway is not a party to this lawsuit, it lacks jurisdiction to enter
the stipulated judgment as drafted, and Westlake has not provided any authority
for the Court to enter the stipulated judgment under Section 664.6 in favor of
non-parties, such as Midway.  Absent such
authority, the Court declines to enter the stipulated judgment.  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            The Court
denies Plaintiff Westlake’s motion to enforce settlement under Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6 without prejudice. 

 
              Plaintiff Westlake shall provide notice of
the Court’s ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
