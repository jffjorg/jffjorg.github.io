MOTION
 
This action stems from a multi-vehicle motor collision.  On April 28, 2023, Plaintiff Sophia Kraft (“Plaintiff”
or “Kraft”) sued Defendant Miguel Anaya (“Anaya”) for Motor Vehicle.  On August 9, 2023, Plaintiff added Defendant
Daniel Salcido, Jr. (“Salcido”) via Doe amendment.  
 
On September 26 and September 27, 2023, Salcido filed two cross-complaints
against Anaya for negligence in the first cross-complaint, and declaratory
relief and apportionment of fault in the second cross-complaint.  On March 27, 2024, Plaintiff reached a
settlement with Defendants and dismissed the original complaint.
 
On June 20, 2024, the Court related this case with case number 23SMCV04518,
filed by plaintiff Ashlee Zamora against Anaya for motor vehicle.

(Ex.
B to Mukhina Decl.)
 
Salcido challenges the requests on the grounds that the subpoenas are
overbroad, requesting any and all medical records from 2011 to the present, not
limited to the medical conditions at issue or the affected body parts, and
therefore, the requests violate Salcido’s privacy.  The Court agrees.  The requests appear overbroad on their face,
both in scope and in time, and Anaya has not opposed the motion demonstrating
otherwise.
 
Sanctions
 
In ruling on a motion to quash, “the court may in its discretion award
the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred in making or opposing the
motion, including reasonable attorney's fees, if the court finds the motion was
made or opposed in bad faith or without substantial justification or that one
or more of the requirements of the subpoena was oppressive.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1987.2, subd. (a).)
 
            Having
found the subpoenas to be overbroad and an oppressive violation of Salcido’s
privacy rights on their face, the Court grants Salcido’s request for sanctions
in the amount of $968.91, representing 3 hours of time to prepare the motion at
counsel’s hourly rate of $300, plus the $68.91 reservation fee for the
motion.  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court grants Plaintiff’s Motion to Quash and quashes
the three identified subpoenas issued to Kaiser Permanente.  
 
Further, the Court grants Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against
Anaya’s counsel, Tharpe & Howell, in the amount of $968.91, payable to Salcido,
by and through counsel for Salcido, within thirty days of notice of this
order.  
 
Salcido shall provide notice of the Court’s order and file the notice
with a proof of service forthwith.
