And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash subpoenas served on Kaiser Permanente by defendant Anaya. The subpoenas seek medical records of cross-complainant Salcido, dating back to 2011, and the judge finds that they are overbroad and violate Salcido's privacy. The judge grants Salcido's request to quash the subpoenas and also grants Salcido's request for sanctions in the amount of $968.91, payable to Salcido within 30 days. The judge also orders Salcido to provide notice of the court's order and file the notice with proof of service forthwith.
