Significant Statements:
  - "The mere fact that an action was filed after protected activity took place does not mean the action arose from that activity for the purposes of the anti-SLAPP statute." (Gallimore v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Ins. Co. (2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 1388, 1398)
  - "That a cause of action arguably may have been 'triggered' by protected activity does not entail that it is one arising from such. In the anti-SLAPP context, the critical consideration is whether the cause of action is based on the defendant's protected free speech or petitioning activity." (Ibid.)

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion to strike the defendant's cross-complaint for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The defendant alleged that the plaintiffs wrongfully investigated and defended the claims against him in the Kobayashi Lawsuit, and the judge found that these allegations do not arise from the plaintiffs' decision to petition the court for reimbursement. The judge also rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the defendant's claims are barred by the anti-SLAPP statute, which aims to protect individuals from lawsuits that are intended to chill their exercise of free speech or petition for redress of grievances. The judge concluded that the defendant's claims are based on the plaintiffs' alleged wrongful conduct in investigating and defending the claims against him, rather than on the plaintiffs' decision to sue for reimbursement.
