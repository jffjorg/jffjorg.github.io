 Case Number:  23NWCV03977    Hearing Date:   January 17, 2025    Dept:  C This personal injury action was filed on December 7, 2023. A hearing for an Order to Show Cause Re: Settlement (OSC re Settlement) is scheduled for March 6, 2025. Lien Claimant AMN Healthcare, Inc.’s (Lien Claimant) Motion to Enforce Worker’s Compensation Lien Against Settlement Reached is currently scheduled to be heard after the OSC re Settlement, on March 27, 2025. Lien Claimant now moves ex parte to Shorten Time/Advance Date for Hearing. Lien Claimant argues good cause exists because the Court may dismiss the case if Plaintiff’s counsel does not appear at the OSC re Settlement hearing. Lien Claimant has received notice from Plaintiff’s counsel that Plaintiff does not intend to honor the worker’s compensation lien. Therefore, Lien Claimant argues it would not have an opportunity to argue before the Court as to why the statutory lien should be enforced if this case is dismissed before the hearing on its Motion. Lien Claimant’s Ex Parte Application to Shorten Time/Advance Date for Hearing is GRANTED. The hearing on the Motion to Enforce Worker’s Compensation Lien Against Settlement Reached is ADVANCED to today’s date and CONTINUED to February 26, 2025, at 10:30 AM in Dept. C. Opposition and Reply papers to be filed and served per Code in accordance with the new hearing dates. Moving party to give notice.
