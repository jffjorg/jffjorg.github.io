This action arises out of a contract for work to be
performed on Plaintiff Ruben Nunez’s (Plaintiff) home by Defendant Restore
Tactics, Inc. (RTI).  Plaintiff contends
that the work was not properly performed. 
Therefore, on 11/13/23, Plaintiff filed this action against RTI, James
Sotelo Duran, Okalani Manu Taufahema and Henry Renteria for: (1) Breach of
Contract, (2) Negligence, (3) Fraud and (4) Disgorgement Pursuant to Business
& Professions Code 7031.
 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the
issues defendants have with the complaint, on 1/29/24, RTI filed and served the
instant demurrer to the entire complaint and motion to strike which seeks to
strike portions of the complaint relating to exemplary damages, punitive
damages and attorneys’ fees.  On 4/5/24,
3 court days late and only 1 court day before a reply was due to be filed and
served, Plaintiff filed and served oppositions to the demurrer and motion to
strike.  See CCP 1005(b).  As of 4/11/24, no replies have been
filed.  
 
In order to give RTI the opportunity to respond to the
opposition arguments, the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike will be
continued.  Any replies are due to be
filed and served at least 5 court days before the continued hearing date.
