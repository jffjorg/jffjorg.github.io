SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Ruben Ramirez’s
(Plaintiff) employment as a truck driver with/for Defendants: (1) Juan Carlos Saucedo (Saucedo), (2) K12 School Services
(K12), 
(3) Fresh Start Healthy School Meals (Fresh Start
Healthy) and (4) Fresh Start Meals, Inc. (Fresh Start Meals).  On 8/2/21, Plaintiff filed this action
against Defendants for: (1) Unpaid Overtime; (2) Unpaid Minimum Wages; (3)
Non-compliant Wage Statements; (4) Wages Not Timely Paid During and Upon
Separation of Employment; (5) Unpaid Business Expenses; (6) Unpaid Meal Period
Premiums; (7) Unpaid Rest Period Premiums; (8) Violation of California Business
& Professions Code§§ 17200, et seq.; and (9) Failure to Provide Employment
Records in Violation of Labor Code§§ 1198.5 & 432.7.
 
On 8/30/23, Plaintiff served Saucedo with Requests for
Admissions, Set 2, making responses due on or before 10/2/23.  (Roshanian Decl.).  Saucedo did not serve responses despite Plaintiff’s
counsel’s meet and confer efforts.  Id.  Therefore, on 10/12/23, Plaintiff filed and
served the instant motion seeking an order that the truth of each matter
specified in Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions, Set 2, served on 8/30/23 to
Defendant Juan Carlos Saucedo be deemed admitted.  Additionally, Plaintiff requests sanctions
against Saucedo in the amount of $2,460.00. 
No opposition or other response to the instant motion has been
filed.  On 4/8/24, Plaintiff served a
Notice of Non-Opposition to the motion.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Due to Saucedo’s failure to serve responses to the
subject Requests for Admissions, Plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the
matters admitted.  CCP 2033.280(b),
(c).  Imposition of sanctions against
Saucedo is mandatory due to his failure to provide timely responses.  Id. 
However, the Court finds the $2,460.00 in sanctions requested to be
excessive.  The Court awards $1,060.00 in
sanctions (1 hour to prepare the motion + 1 hour to appear at $500/hour +
$60.00 filing fee).
 
CONCLUSION
 
The Requests for Admissions, Set 2, served on Defendant
Juan Carlos Saucedo on 8/30/23 are deemed admitted.  Sanctions in the amount of $1,060.00 are
imposed against Defendant Juan Carlos Saucedo and are payable within 30
days.
