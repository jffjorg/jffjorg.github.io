RULING:   
 
This action arises out of the death of the minor’s father
in a motor vehicle accident caused by a drunk driver.  Minor did not receive any treatment and the
petition indicates that he has completely recovered.
 
Defendant Dylan Rutherford has agreed to pay $30,000 in
settlement.  Costs of $15,138.05 will be
deducted from the settlement amount.  No
attorney fees will be deducted.  The
minor will receive $14,861.95 which will be invested in a single-premium
deferred annuity, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the
court.  
 
The proofs of service attached to the petition and
proposed order indicate the documents were served on Defendant Dylan
Rutherford’s counsel by electronic mail at eedward@lbbslaw.com
which does not match the email address in eCourt for Rutherford’s counsel (kara.pape@lewisbrisbois.com) or
the email address (Edward.Ward@lewisbrisbois.com)
on the last document filed on behalf of Rutherford on 2/9/23.
 
If Rutherford’s counsel appears at the hearing or submits
a declaration indicating that Rutherford has no objection to the granting of
the petition, the petition will be granted. 
If not, the hearing will be continued so that the petition can be
properly served on Rutherford’s counsel.
