[TENTATIVE] RULING ON ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE RE: PRELIMINARY
  INJUNCTION
 
Dept. 86 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)
 
 




 


 


 


 



            Petitioner BSH Investments, LLC
moves for a preliminary injunction against defendants (1) FYJA, LLC; (2) Le
Conte Westwood Development, LLC; (3) Evanston Road, LLC; (4) Donald Rezak; and (5)
Freedom REIT, from proceeding on a foreclosure sale of the real property
located at 10916-10928 Le Conte Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90024. 
 
I.       Factual Background
 
A.          
HSK
and Sellers Enter into Purchase and Sale Agreements
 
On January 18, 2024, HSK
Properties, LLC—the predecessor of plaintiff BSH Investments, LLC (“BSH”)—and defendants
FYJA, LLC, Le Conte
Westwood Development, LLC, and Evanston Road, LLC (collectively “Sellers”) entered into three purchase and sale agreements
(“PSAs”) for HSK to purchase real property located at 10916-10928 Le Conte Avenue, Los
Angeles, California 90024 (“Property”). (Compl. ¶
23.)[1] HSK
sought to acquire the Property to develop, manage, and operate it as affordable
housing. (Compl. ¶ 21.) The Property is located in close proximity to UCLA,
potentially providing affordable housing options for UCLA employees, students,
and others who may not otherwise be able to afford to live close to the campus.
(Compl. ¶ 22.)
 
The terms in each of the
PSAs are substantially similar. (Compl. ¶ 23 & Exs. A-C [PSAs].) 
 
Provisions Regarding Closing Date. The “Closing Date” was to be calculated based on the date that all of
the buyer’s contingencies had been waived. (Compl. ¶ 26.) Specifically, section
10 of the “SUMMARY AND DEFINITION OF BASIC TERMS” for each of the PSAs defined
the “Closing Date” to be “180 Days after the waiver of all Buyer’s
Contingencies….” (PSAs, Section 10 of Summary and Definition of Basic Terms.)
 
Provisions Regarding Liens on the Property. The PSAs contain several provisions concerning
Sellers’ obligation to deliver clear title at closing, with no existing
monetary liens on the Property to remain on title. At issue in this action is
the lien related to the $5 million loan made by defendant Freedom REIT
(“REIT”). (Compl. ¶ 28.)
 
The PSAs require Sellers
to deliver preliminary title reports to the buyer. (See PSAs, § 4.2.1.)
Additionally, the same section requires that:
 
Seller shall cause all
Monetary Liens (as defined below) removed on or before the Closing Date. As
used herein, the term “Monetary Liens” shall mean (i) all monetary liens
affecting the Property which were expressly and voluntarily created or assumed
by Seller, (ii) all liens relating to delinquent taxes and assessments and
interests and penalties thereon, and (iii) all mechanic’s liens resulting from
work that Seller has performed or caused to be performed at the Property or
from work which was otherwise expressly approved by Seller.
 
(PSAs § 4.2.1.)
 
Section 4.3.2 of each of the
PSAs states: “Seller shall have duly performed in all material respects each
and every covenant of Seller required to be performed by Seller hereunder prior
to the Close of Escrow.” (PSAs § 4.3.2.) Section 9.4 of each of the PSAs also
requires that:
 
Prior to the Closing or
the earlier termination of this Agreement, Seller shall not voluntarily
alienate, lien, encumber or otherwise transfer all or any portion of the
Property (other than to Buyer at the Closing), except to the extent that the
same shall be capable of being cured prior to the Closing. 
 
(PSAs § 9.4.)
 
Provisions Regarding Remedies for Sellers’ Breaches. The PSAs contemplate that the buyer may seek
specific performance to remedy certain violations of the PSAs. Section 16.1 of
each of the PSAs provide in pertinent part that:
 
In the event the Close of
Escrow does not occur as herein provided solely by reason of any default of
Seller…(ii) Buyer may seek specific performance of this Agreement. If Buyer
elects the remedy in subsection (ii) above, Buyer must (a) be ready and able to
timely close this transaction in accordance with this Agreement and (b)
commence and file such specific performance action in the appropriate court not
later than thirty (30) days following the scheduled Closing Date.
 
(PSAs § 16.1.) Section
16.5 of each of the PSAs further provide in pertinent part:
 
The Sellers acknowledge
that the Real Property which would be transferred under this Agreement is
unique because, among other reasons, Buyer is contemplating the purchase of the
Real Property hereunder as part of a larger business plan. In furtherance of
such business plan Buyer has spent, and will continue to spend, a considerable
amount of money and resources. Buyer is also in the process of purchasing or
leasing other land upon which to operate the business following the closing,
which it would not be undertaking if not for Buyer’s acquisition of the Real Property.
If the Real Property were not acquired by Buyer there would be a material
adverse effect on Buyer’s ability to execute on its business plan. Accordingly,
the parties acknowledge that the remedy of damages alone would be inadequate
for any breach of this Agreement by Seller. Therefore, upon a breach by Seller
of its obligations, Buyer shall be entitled to obtain a remedy of specific
performance.
 
(PSAs § 16.5).
 
Provision Regarding Assignability of PSAs. Section 17 of the PSAs states: 
 
Buyer may not assign,
transfer or convey its rights and obligations under this Agreement or in the
Property without the prior written consent of Seller (which consent may be
given or withheld in Seller’s sole and absolute discretion), and no such
approved assignment shall relieve Buyer from its liability under this Agreement
until Buyer’s assignee has fully performed all of Buyer’s obligations hereunder
and the Close of Escrow has occurred. Seller consents in advance to an
assignment by Buyer to any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with Buyer. Any assignee shall assume all of Buyer’s obligations hereunder
and succeed to all of Buyer’s rights and remedies hereunder and any assignment
and assumption must be in writing and delivered to Seller at least ten (10)
business days prior to the Closing Date.
 
(PSAs § 17.) 
 
B.          
The Commerce Escrow
Letter Agreement
 
After the parties
executed the PSAs, escrow instructions in a “Letter Agreement” were provided by
the escrow agent, Commerce Escrow, to the parties. (Compl. ¶ 40; 8/13/21
Nissani Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex. B.) The Letter Agreement references a “Close of
Escrow” date of July 16, 2024. (8/13/21 Nissani Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex. B.) The
Letter Agreement states that its terms are meant to be “in accordance with your
Agreement,” i.e., the PSAs. The Letter Agreement further provides: “[I]n
case of a conflict between your Agreement and the General Provisions [of the
Letter Agreement], your Agreement shall prevail.” (8/13/21 Nissani Decl. ¶ 3
& Ex. B.)
 
C.          
Diligence Review and
Lifting of Contingencies
 
On or about January 29,
2024, an agent for HSK, Hooman Nissani, requested that he be provided the
preliminary title report. (8/13/21 Nissani Decl. ¶ 4.) In response, Rezak,
through his assistant, provided on behalf of Sellers the preliminary title
report as of October 30, 2023. (8/13/21 Nissani Decl. ¶ 4 & Ex. C.)  The October 30, 2023 title report discloses REIT’s
deed of trust to secure a $5 million indebtedness, as well as a notice of
default recorded August 30, 2023. (8/13/21 Nissani Decl. ¶ 4; Ex. C.)  The title report does not disclose the Notice
of Trustee’s Sale related to the REIT loan, which was recorded on December 5,
2023. (8/13/21 Nissani Decl. ¶ 4; Ex. C; Beehler Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex. B.) 
 
Sellers represented that
they were negotiating with their “banks” to resolve their debts, so they could deliver
clear title at closing. (8/13/21 Nissani Decl. ¶ 5.) During multiple occasions
in spring 2024, Rezak led HSK to believe Sellers would soon resolve issues with
their lenders so that they could comply with their obligations to remove the
liens before closing. (8/13/21 Nissani Decl. ¶ 5.)
 
HSK obtained additional
diligence materials over the ensuing months after signing in January 2024. (8/13/21
Nissani Decl. ¶ 6.) After completing diligence review in accordance with the
PSAs, HSK and Rezak discussed a credit to HSK based on the outcome of the
diligence review. After further discussions, on April 29, 2024, Rezak wrote:
 
“1. Buyer and Seller
(i.e., you and I) agreed to the split the difference between $758,798.00 offset
in your Property Condition Report and the $529,098.00 I proposed, resulting in
a $643,948.00 reduction to the Purchase Price; 
 
2. Dwayne will provide an
amendment to the escrow instructions to reflect the aforesaid reduction and the
pertinent matters in this email;
 
3. All all [sic]
contingencies regarding due diligence are approved by Buyer and the deposit is
now non-refundable, subject to the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement; 
 
4. The escrow funds are
to be released (and I have provided you with wire instructions for a wire
transfer tomorrow)….
 
HSK responded: “Good
morning approved.” (8/13/21 Nissani Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. D.)
 
On May 1, 2024, the
parties entered into Amended Escrow Instructions that stated, in key part, that
“[a]ll Buyer's Contingencies as referenced in the Agreement of Purchase and
Sale and Joint Escrow Instructions have been waived and or Approved…. Escrow
Holder is authorized and instructed to release $846,939.06 of the Buyer’s
deposit to the Seller without any further written or verbal instructions needed
from either party…. All other terms and conditions shall remain the same.”
(Compl. ¶ 46 & Ex. E.)
 
180 days from the removal
of contingencies on May 1, 2024 is October 28, 2024. (Compl. ¶ 47.)
 
D.          
Assignment of PSAs to Plaintiff
 
On May 10, 2024, HSK assigned
its interest in the PSAs to BSH. (Compl. ¶ 48 & Ex. F.) HSK created BSH for
the purpose of acquiring the Property. (Murillo Decl. ¶ 2.) The majority of
members of HSK and BSH overlap. (Murillo Decl. ¶ 2.)
 
E.          
Sellers Try to Close in
July
 
Sellers have taken the
position that the transaction was required to close in July 2024. Counsel for
Sellers has sent a letter to HSK maintaining that the parties had established a
“date certain for the Closing Date” through the Letter Agreement prepared by
Commerce Escrow. (Compl. ¶ 50.) Sellers’ counsel thus asserted that the Closing
Date was July 16, 2024, and demanded that HSK close by August 13, 2024 or
Sellers would exercise their “rights and remedies.”  (Compl. ¶ 50 & Ex. G.)
 
F.          
Monetary Lien Remains on
Property
 
On August 21, 2024, plaintiff’s
counsel wrote to counsel for REIT requesting a status update on its
conversation with its borrower (i.e., the Sellers) and specifically to
offer that Plaintiff buy the note. (9/6/24 Beehler Decl. ¶ 2 & Ex. A.)
Counsel for plaintiff inquired whether REIT would entertain a note purchase
from REIT and what amount REIT was seeking to sell the note and resolve the foreclosure. (9/6/24 Beehler
Decl. ¶ 2 & Ex. A at 5.) In response, counsel for REIT stated: “The payoff on
the note is $6,161,703.48 today. My client will sell the note for the full
amount due at the time of the purchase subject to the execution of an
acceptable purchase agreement….” (9/6/24 Beehler Decl. ¶ 2 & Ex. A at 4.) Plaintiff
then provided a term sheet by which the note would be paid in full. (9/6/24
Beehler Decl. ¶ 2 & Exs. A at 3, B.) In response, REIT wrote that it would
not pursue a sale of the note with plaintiff and that the trustee’s sale had
been postponed to October 2, 2024. (9/6/24 Beehler Decl. ¶ 2 & Ex. A at 2.)
 
II.      Procedural History 

            On
August 12, 2024, plaintiff BSH filed the Complaint. On August 20, 2024, the
Court granted plaintiff’s ex parte application, issued a temporary restraining
order enjoining any foreclosure sale of the Property, and issued an order to
show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue. 
 
            On August 22, 2024, BSH filed a supplemental brief in
support of the requested preliminary injunction. On September 3, 2024, Sellers
and REIT filed separate oppositions. On September 6, 2024, BSH filed a reply. 
 
III.     Analysis
 
“[T]he question whether a preliminary injunction
should be granted involves two interrelated factors: (1) the likelihood that
the plaintiff will prevail on the merits, and (2) the relative balance of harms
that is likely to result from the granting or denial of interim injunctive
relief.”  (White v. Davis (2003)
30 Cal.4th 528, 554.)
 
A.          
Evidentiary Matters
 
Sellers’ request to take judicial notice of the
papers and pleadings in Park View Apt, LLC vs Seven Ark, LLC, et al.,
Case No. 18STCV03515 is DENIED as irrelevant. (Mangini
v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1057, 1063 [“Although a court
may judicially notice a variety of matters (Evid. Code, § 450 et seq.), only
relevant material may be noticed”].) 
Further, it is inadmissible character evidence. (See Evid. Code §
1101.)
 
Sellers’ requests to take judicial notice of
Exhibits 1-3 attached to the declaration of Donald Rezak are GRANTED. (Evid.
Code § 452(c); Pedus Building Services, Inc. v. Allen (2002) 96
Cal.App.4th 152, 156, fn. 2.)
 
            Plaintiff’s
objections to the supplemental declaration of Donald Rezak are OVERRULED. 
 
B.          
Standing
 
Sellers argue that plaintiff BSH has no standing to
purchase the Property under the PSAs. For the purpose of BSH demonstrating a likelihood
of success on the merits of its claims as the plaintiff, the Court disagrees. 
 
With respect to assignability of the PSAs, BSH
presents three “Assignment[s] of Commercial Real Estate Contract” whereby HSK
assigned its rights under the PSAs to BSH. (Compl. ¶ 48 & Ex. F.) The PSAs provide
that HSK may not assign its rights under the agreements “without the prior written
consent of Seller….” (PSAs § 17.) It is undisputed that no such written
consent was provided. However, the PSAs also provide: “Seller consents in
advance to an assignment by Buyer to any entity controlling, controlled by, or under
common control with Buyer.” (PSAs § 17.)
 
BSH’s managing member avers: “BSH is an entity under
common control with the original buyer–HSK.  Specifically, the majority of the members of
HSK and BSH overlap. HSK specifically created BSH for the purposes of acquiring
the Property. Accordingly, HSK and BSH are under common control.” (Murillo
Decl. ¶ 2; see also Supp. Murillo Decl. ¶ 2.) The truth of BSH’s assertion
of common control may ultimately be determined in this litigation, but, for
purposes of the instant motion, the Court finds the averments that HSK created
BSH to acquire the property and that the majority of the members of HSK and BSH
overlap sufficiently demonstrate a likelihood of success in establishing BSH’s
standing as plaintiff.[2]
 
Further, regardless of whether BSH registered with
the State of California after it verified the Complaint, it is undisputed that
BSH is now in good standing and may continue to prosecute this action. (See Benton
v. County of Napa (1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1485, 1490 [corporation that was
previously suspended may carry on litigation after receiving certificate of
revivor, “even to the extent of validating otherwise invalid prior proceedings”].)
 
C.          
Likelihood of Prevailing on Merits
 
The parties dispute the Closing Date under the PSAs.
BSH maintains the Closing Date is October 28, 2024, 180 days from May 1, 2024,
when HSK released the contingencies. (Compl. ¶ 47.) Sellers maintain the
Closing Date is July 16, 2024, the date indicated in the Letter Agreement. (Rezak
Decl. ¶ 22; 8/13/24 Nissani Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex. B.)
 
The Court is persuaded by BSH’s interpretation. The
PSAs define the “Closing Date” as “180 Days after the waiver of all Buyer’s
Contingencies.” (PSAs, Section 10 of
Summary and Definition of Basic Terms.) It is undisputed that HSK waived its
contingencies on May 1, 2024, as memorialized in Amended Escrow Instructions. (Compl.
¶ 46 & Ex. E.) 180 days from May 1, 2024 is October 28, 2024. (Compl.
¶ 47.)
 
Sellers contend that the PSAs were amended by the
Letter Agreement dated January 29, 2024. (Rezak Decl. ¶ 22; 8/13/24 Nissani
Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex. B.) With respect to amendments, the PSAs state: “This
Agreement may not be modified, changed, supplemented or terminated, nor may any
obligations hereunder be waived, except by written instrument signed by the
party to be charged.” (PSAs § 18.8.) While the Letter Agreement may be a
written instrument, the Court does not find that it modifies or changes the
terms of the PSAs.   
 
The Letter Agreement in no way states that it is
meant to amend the PSAs or identifies itself as a written instrument intended
as such.  Indeed, the Letter Agreement
describes July 16, 2024 as the “Close of Escrow” “[i]n accordance with your
Agreement” and does not refer to July 16, 2024 as the “Closing Date.”  If the Letter Agreement were actually meant
to amend a term in the PSAs—namely, the “Closing Date”—one might expect the
Letter Agreement to have used the actual term it sought to amend.  Rather, the Letter Agreement simply sets
forth the escrow company’s understanding (albeit erroneous) that the transaction
was meant to close on July 16, 2024, as that date is 180 days after the January
18, 2024 effective date of the PSAs. 
Indeed, the use of the phrase “Close of Escrow” would seem to
indicate that the July 16, 2024 date was set forth from the perspective of the escrow
company.  The Court thus finds that plaintiff
is likely to prevail in its contention that the “Closing Date” is October 28,
2024 because the PSAs were not amended by the escrow company’s Letter
Agreement. 
 
            Further,
“if a party to a contract expressly or by implication repudiates the contract
before the time for his or her performance has arrived, an anticipatory breach
is said to have occurred.” (Mammoth Lakes Land Acquisition, LLC v. Town of
Mammoth Lakes (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 435, 467, quoting Romano v.
Rockwell Internat., Inc. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 479, 489.) Based on a Closing
Date of October 28, 2024, Sellers’ insistence that HSK close the sale in
accordance with a Closing Date of July 16, 2024 constitutes an anticipatory
breach of the PSAs. Moreover, Sellers’ failure to pay off REIT’s lien and allow
the Property to be subject to foreclosure appears to be an anticipatory breach
of sections 4.2.1, 4.3.2, and 9.4 of
the PSAs. Under section 16.1 and 16.5 of the PSAs, plaintiff demonstrates a
likelihood that they are entitled to specific performance. 
 
            REIT
argues that it is a bona fide encumbrancer of the Property.  This argument fails.  To begin with, that doctrine has to do with
lien priority. (Kahan v. City of Richmond (2019) 35 Cal.App.5th 721, 740.)  Plaintiff’s right to purchase the Property is
not a lien.  But even if one could
logically compare these apples and oranges, the “bona fide encumbrancer”
doctrine applies when the encumbrancer acquired a lien in good faith without
knowledge or notice of a prior interest. (Ibid.) Here, HSK/BSH’s
interest in the Property occurred upon execution of the PSAs in January 2024, which
came after REIT’s recording of its Deed of Trust. (8/13/24 Beehler Decl.
¶ 3 & Ex. B [Deed of Trust recorded on 12/30/21].) The bona fide
encumbrancer doctrine is simply inapposite.
 
REIT also argues that BSH is equitably estopped from
seeking to enforce the PSAs, as HSK had notice of default before it entered
into the PSAs. (See Civ. Code § 3543 [“Where one of two innocent
persons must suffer by the act of a third, he, by whose negligence it happened,
must be the sufferer”].) However, the PSAs provided that Sellers would cause
all liens to be removed. (PSAs § 4.2.1.) As part
of due diligence, Sellers provided HSK with a title report that did not reflect
any Notice of Sale. (Compl. ¶ 43.) Notably, the Notice of Sale was recorded on
December 5, 2023 and HSK requested a preliminary title report on January 29,
2024, Sellers provided a title report from October 30, 2023, which pre-dated
the recording of the Notice of Sale.  (See
8/13/21 Nissani Decl. ¶ 4 & Ex. C.) 
Further, Sellers provided HSK with
assurances that title would be clear before closing. (8/13/21 Nissani Decl. ¶
5.) The Court thus finds BSH has sufficiently made out wrongdoing by Sellers to
establish a likelihood of prevailing on the merits and overcoming any claim of
estoppel.
 
            Lastly,
Sellers argue that no injunction should issue against Rezak because the PSAs
provide that there can be no personal liability for Sellers’ representatives or
agents. Irrespective of whether Rezak may be found personally liable to BSH, it
is undisputed that Sellers are acting through Rezak. (See Rezak Supp. Decl.
¶ 6.)   Further, the PSAs obligate
Sellers to remove all liens and “not voluntarily alienate, lien, encumber or
otherwise transfer all or any portion of the Property.”  (PSAs §§ 4.2.1, 9.4.)
Accordingly, Rezak may be enjoined from assisting or acting in
furtherance of foreclose on the Property.
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, plaintiff demonstrates a
likelihood that it is entitled to specific performance of the PSAs. 
 
D.          
Balance of Harms
 
The Court finds that the balance of harms weighs in
favor of issuance of a preliminary injunction. Given the Property’s proximity
to UCLA and plaintiff’s specific plans for use, the Property is unique. Damages
do not constitute adequate relief. (Real Estate Analytics, LLC v. Vallas
(2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 463, 475, citing Civ. Code § 3387.)
 
            Further,
given that PSAs provide for HSK/BSH to close by October 28, 2024, Sellers have
not demonstrated any harm that would result from the delay of a foreclosure
sale. 
 
            Although
REIT may have committed no wrongdoing in seeking to enforce its Deed of Trust,
the Court finds that BSH is still entitled to a preliminary injunction.  The Court also finds that REIT’s interest in
the repayment of its note are not compromised by the issuance of the
injunction.  To begin with, BSH appears
willing to fully pay REIT for the value of the note, including accrued interest.
(9/6/24 Beehler Decl. ¶¶ 2, 3 & Ex. A, B.) 
In any event, it is clear REIT would fully recover its principal and
accrued interest from the approximately $30 million purchase price from the
transaction upon closing, even accounting for the approximately $13 million
encumbrance in a position superior to REIT’s deed of trust.
 
E.          
Undertaking
 
The Court shall require an undertaking by plaintiff to
account for any damage defendants “may sustain by reason of the injunction, if
the court finally decides that the applicant was not entitled to the
injunction.” (CCP § 529.) In this regard, the Court finds no support for the
assertion that a bond of at least $7 million is required to protect REIT, as
that grossly inflated figure accounts for the entirety of the principal and
interest on REIT’s note.  Rather, the
appropriate measure of harm is the pecuniary loss, if any, REIT would suffer by
not obtaining the approximately $6.1 million due today and instead waiting
until the end of this litigation to be fully paid on its note.  The Court will entertain arguments from the
parties as to what amount of pecuniary loss, if any, that might be for purposes
of an undertaking.
 
IV.     Conclusion
 
            The
motion is GRANTED. Defendants
FYJA, LLC, Le Conte Westwood Development, LLC, Evanston Road, LLC, Donald
Rezak, and Freedom REIT are enjoining from proceeding on a foreclosure sale of
the real property located at 10916-10928 Le Conte Avenue, Los Angeles,
California 90024.
