  - "The reasonableness of the plaintiff's reliance is judged by reference to the plaintiff's knowledge and experience."
  - "In a practical sense it is appropriate to deny an injunction where there is no showing of reasonable probability of success, even though the foreclosure will create irreparable harm, because there is no justification in delaying that harm where, although irreparable, it is also inevitable."

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction to prevent the defendant, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust, from canceling shares of WPFH in the plaintiff's possession and reissuing them in the names of defendants Megan McMurray and Chad Correia. The plaintiff had argued that the defendants misrepresented themselves and their ability to raise capital for the plaintiff's start-up company, and that the plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations when transferring the shares to the defendants.

The judge found that the plaintiff had not demonstrated a likelihood of prevailing on the merits of its claims, and that the plaintiff's reliance on the defendants' representations was not justifiable under the circumstances. The judge also found that the plaintiff had failed to investigate the defendants' background or claims, and that the plaintiff's principal had relied on a mutual acquaintance's recommendation of Correia without conducting any reasonable inquiry.

As a result, the judge denied the plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction and dissolved the temporary restraining order and order to show cause that had been issued earlier.
