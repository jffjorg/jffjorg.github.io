[TENTATIVE] RULING ON VERIFIED PETITION FOR
  PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE
 
Dept. 86 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)
 
 




 
WILLIAM MARSH d/b/a SWIM TO BILL,
 
 


 
 
 
 
Real Party in Interest.
 


 




 


 


 


 



Petitioners
Jed Kubrin and Marisa Kubrin, as co-Trustees of the Kubrin Living Trust petition
for a writ of mandate directing petitioners City of Los Angeles and City
Council of the City of Los Angeles to set aside its approval of a private swim
school operated by real party William Marsh dba Swim to Bill. 
 
I.       Factual Background
 
A.          
Project
Background
 
The
Project at issue is the continued use and operation of a private swim school,
known as “Swim to Bill,” owned by real party in interest William March. The
private swim school operates in the backyard swimming pool of real party’s
home. (AR 21.) Swim to Bill teaches young children how to swim with an emphasis
on water safety skills. (AR 8.). 
 
The
Project is located in a hillside residential neighborhood at 3477 North
Laurelvale Drive in Studio City, Los Angeles. (AR 21-22.) The property is zoned
“RE” Residential Estate Zone and is subject to the “Use” regulations for that
zone under Los Angeles Municipal Code (“LAMC”) § 12.07.01.A. (AR 20.) The Use
regulations list several allowable uses for the property, which include
one-family dwelling, conditional uses listed in section 12.24, and home
occupations that meet the conditions in section 12.05 A.16. (LAMC § 12.07.01.A.1,
7 and 8.)
 
Between
2011 to 2018, Swim to Bill provided swim lessons at 3477 North Laurelvale with
no permits. (AR 8.) The
Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety (“LADBS”) issued written warnings
and citations to Marsh in 2016 and 2017, citing violation of the “home occupation”
ordinance. (AR 32-35.) On April 17, 2017, petitioners filed a complaint with
LADBS because real party continued to run his business in violation of the home
occupation ordinance. (AR 1193-97.)
 
In
March 2018, LADBS issued real party an Order to Comply either with the Home
Occupation provisions under 12.05 A.16 or to seek a discretionary permit to
legalize the use. (AR 605, 760-61.) On April 27, 2018, petitioners filed a
nuisance action in Los Angeles Superior Court, Kubrin et al. v. Marsh et al.,
case no. EC068467, seeking an order enjoining Marsh’s ongoing swim business
without appropriate permits or entitlements. (AR 1193-97.) On June 22, 2018,
the Court (Hon. Benny C. Osorio) issued an injunction enjoining Marsh from
continuing to run his swim business from his backyard pool. (AR 1121-26.)
 
On
July 31, 2018, Swim to Bill applied to the City for a Conditional Use Permit
(“CUP”) to run a private swim school under LAMC § 12.24.U.24(c). (AR 1294-96.)
 
B.          
Project
Approval and the Administrative Process
 
The
City held three hearings on the Project, beginning with an October 25, 2022
hearing before a City Planning Department Hearing Officer. (AR 79, 90-91,
1166-70.) Despite opposition, including from petitioners (AR 1089-99, 1134), the
Planning Department made the recommendation to the City Planning Commission
(“CPC”) to consider the Project exempt from CEQA under Class 1 and Class 23,
and to approve a Conditional Use to permit the operation of a private school in
the RE15-1-H Zone. (AR 37-56.)
 
On
December 15, 2022, the CPC met to consider the Project. (AR 577, 590-666.) The
Project was opposed. (AR 1154-58.) The Department of City Planning (“Department”)
presented a recommendation for approval of the Project. Department staff
recommended various conditions of approval, including limited, seasonal
operation with no operation from October 16 to January 31; limited hours from
8:00 am to 12:15 pm during the summer (June 1 to August 31) and 2:00 pm to 6:15
pm in the spring and fall months. (AR 21.) Department staff recommended other
conditions that would limit classes to one instructor and only three students
per class, with a maximum of 18 students per day, a 15-minute buffer period
between classes, and no amplified music. (AR 4, 21, 33, 566.) The hearing
included public testimony from many community members supporting Swim to Bill, including
testimony from parents whose children learned how to swim in real party’s
classes. (AR 615-28.). 
 
The
Commission engaged in considered deliberations regarding the benefits to the
community of having schools in residential neighborhoods. Commissioner Millman
stated: “[W]e put schools in residential neighborhoods and oftentimes in
single-family neighborhoods…hillside single-family neighborhoods” and because
“of what schools do … we want them in residential neighborhoods.” (AR 635-36.)
Commissioner Hornstock opined that “having swim lessons, having piano lessons,
having yoga, all these things in a neighborhood is a gift…it’s part of being…in
a community.” (AR 640.) Regarding complaints about noise, Commissioner Millman
pointed to the noise study, which showed the “decibel noise … is fairly
imperceptible.” (AR 636.) During their deliberations, the commissioners
recognized the complaints by some neighbors who opposed the Project and
reiterated that the Commission imposes standard conditions on schools “to lower
the impacts…on the neighborhood” regarding “hours of operation and parking and
number of students… allowed.” (AR 636.) Commissioner Perlman echoed the
comments of his fellow commissioner and offered this parting recommendation to
all parties involved: “[W]e live in a city. We don't each live on our own
island. We have to work and live with our neighbors.” (AR 638.) On January 24,
2023, the CPC issued a Letter of Determination, as corrected on February 28,
2023, approving the Project and adopting conditions to address impacts of the
Project on the neighborhood. (AR 1-12.) The
CPC also concluded that the project was exempt from CEQA based on Class 1 (existing
facilities) and Class 23 (normal operations of existing facilities). (AR 10.)
 
A
neighbor of the Project, petitioner Jed Kubrin, appealed the CPC decision to
the Los Angeles City Council. On September 19, 2023, the City Council Planning
and Land Use Management (“PLUM”) Committee held a hearing on petitioner’s
appeal. (AR 683-705.) After considering all comments and testimony, the City
Council denied petitioners’ appeal and approved the Project, determining that
the Project was exempt under CEQA’s Class 1 Exemption for existing facilities
and Class 23 exemption for normal operations of facilities and that no
exceptions applied to the exemptions. (AR 1-16, 20-24.) The City Council
adopted the PLUM Committee’s
report
and recommendation on September 27, 2023, and, on September 29, 2023,
transferred the Project file to the Mayor’s Office. (AR 15-16, 715-58.) On or
about October 6, 2023, the Mayor approved the City Council’s action. (AR
15-16.) 
 
II.      Procedural History
 
            On
November 17, 2023, petitioners filed a Verified Petition for Peremptory Writ of
Mandate. On April 15, 2024, respondents filed an Answer.
 
            On
May 29, 2024, respondents filed a Motion to Dismiss for Failure to Comply with
Public Resources Code Section 21167.4. On August 7, 2024, petitioner filed an
opposition. On August 12, 2024, respondents filed a reply. 
 
            On June 13, 2024, petitioners filed
a Motion for CCP § 473(b) Relief from Late Filing of Notice of Request for
Hearing Pursuant to Public Resources Code § 21167.4. On June 21, 2024,
respondents opposed petitioners’ Motion for Relief in connection with
petitioners’ ex parte application to advance the hearing. On August 13, 2024,
petitioners filed a reply. 
 
            On
June 24, 2024, the Court advanced the hearing on petitioners’ Motion for Relief
to be heard with respondents’ Motion to Dismiss. 
 
            On
July 1, 2024, petitioners filed an opening brief in support of the writ
petition. On July 29, 2024, respondents filed an opposition. On August 13, 2024,
petitioners filed a reply. The Court has received an electronic copy of the
administrative record and a hard copy of the joint appendix. 
 
III.
    Respondents’ Motion to Dismiss and
Petitioners’ Motion for CCP § 473(b) Relief from Late Filing
 
            Before the Court are two competing
motions raising the same issues.  In the Motion to Dismiss for
Failure to Comply with Public Resources Code Section 21167.4, respondents City
of Los Angeles and Los Angeles City Council move for an order of dismissal of
the first cause of action for Violations of the California Environmental
Quality Act with prejudice. In the Motion for CCP § 473(b) Relief from Late
Filing of Notice of Request for Hearing Pursuant to Public Resources Code §
21167.4, petitioners Jeb Kubrin and Marisa Kubrin, as co-Trustees of The Kubrin
Living Trust, move for an order relieving petitioners from their failure to
comply with Public Resources Code § 21167.4.
 
            As a preliminary matter,
respondents’ requests for judicial notice are DENIED as “unnecessary to the
resolution” of the issues before the Court. (Martinez v. San Diego County
Credit Union (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 1048, 1075.)
 
            Section 21167.4(a) states: “In any
action or proceeding alleging noncompliance with this division [where CEQA is
codified], the petitioner shall request a hearing within 90 days from the date
of filing the petition or shall be subject to dismissal on the court’s own
motion or on the motion of any party interested in the action or proceeding.” “The
meaning of the language used in section 21167.4, subdivision (a) is
unambiguous. It requires superior courts to grant a motion to dismiss filed by
an interested party when a CEQA petitioner has failed to file a request for
hearing within 90 days from the date of filing the petition. Furthermore,
dismissal is mandatory regardless of whether a request for hearing was filed
before the motion to dismiss.” (Fiorentino v. City of Fresno (2007)
150 Cal.App.4th 596, 605, footnote omitted.)
 
            Here, it is undisputed petitioners
did not comply with section 21167.4. Petitioners did not file a request for a
hearing with the Court until June 13, 2024, which was more than 90 days from November
17, 2023, the date of filing of the petition.[1]
(See Munoz Decl. ¶ 11.) Accordingly, upon motion, the CEQA action
is subject to mandatory dismissal.
 
The
Court may grant relief from dismissal for failure to timely request a hearing
date under Public Resources Code § 21167.4. (Comunidad en Accion v. Los
Angeles City Council (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1131-32; McCormick
v. Board of Supervisors (1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 352, 362-63.) “The
language of CEQA does not shield Public Resources Code section 21167.4
dismissals from the amelioratory provisions of section 473 of the Code of Civil
Procedure.” (Miller v. City of Hermosa Beach (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th
1118, 1135-37.)
 
“The
court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal
representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken
against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy
of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the
application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time,
in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken.” (CCP § 473(b).)
 
“‘A
party who seeks relief under section 473 on the basis of mistake or
inadvertence of counsel must demonstrate that such mistake, inadvertence, or
general neglect was excusable because the negligence of the attorney is imputed
to his client and may not be offered by the latter as a basis for relief.’
[Citation.] In determining whether the attorney's mistake or inadvertence was
excusable, ‘the court inquires whether “a reasonably prudent person under the
same or similar circumstances” might have made the same error.[’] [Citation.]
In other words, the discretionary relief provision of section 473 only permits
relief from attorney error ‘fairly imputable to the client, i.e.,
mistakes anyone could have made.’ [Citation.] ‘Conduct falling below the
professional standard of care, such as failure to timely object or to properly
advance an argument, is not therefore excusable. To hold otherwise would be to
eliminate the express statutory requirement of excusability and effectively
eviscerate the concept of attorney malpractice.’ [Citation.] [¶] The party
seeking relief under section 473 must also be diligent. [Citation.] Thus, an
application for relief must be made ‘within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was
taken.’ [Citation.] [¶] Where the mistake is excusable and the party seeking
relief has been diligent, courts have often granted relief pursuant to the
discretionary relief provision of section 473 if no prejudice to the opposing
party will ensue. [Citations.]”
 
(Comunidad,
219 Cal.App.4th at 1132-33.)
 
            Petitioners’ counsel submits a
declaration indicating that, after the Court entered an order to continue the
trial setting conference and extend the time to certify the administrative
record, he asked his assistant to update the firm’s calendar. (Slade Decl. ¶
10.) After the dates were updated, the deadline to file a request for hearing
under Public Resources Code § 21167.4 did not appear on the firm’s calendar.
(Slade Decl. ¶ 10.) Petitioners’ counsel declares: “It is unclear now whether
the deadline for filing the § 21167.4 notice was deleted from the calendar when
the new dates were entered, or if it was accidentally never entered in the
first place.” (Slade Decl. ¶ 10.) In subsequent communications concerning deadlines
and scheduling, respondents’ counsel did not mention the § 21167.4 notice or a
desire to expedite the CEQA hearing. (Slade Decl. ¶¶ 11, 13, 17.) However, respondents’
counsel indicated on April 2, 2024 during a CEQA status conference that
respondents might file a motion to dismiss the CEQA cause of action. (Slade
Decl. ¶ 15.) Petitioner’s counsel did not understand that respondents’
counsel was referring to the § 21167.4 notice requirement. (Slade Decl. ¶ 15.)
On April 15, 2024, respondents served and filed an Answer indicating an
affirmative defense based on petitioners’ failure to comply with section
21167.4. (Answer, First Affirmative Defense.) On April 25, 2024, during the
continued status conference, counsel for respondents indicated that no decision
had been made regarding whether a motion to dismiss would be filed. (Slade
Decl. ¶ 16.) After respondents filed their Motion to Dismiss, petitioners filed
their Motion for Relief and only then was the request for hearing made in an
attachment. (Slate Decl. ¶¶ 19, 20 & Ex. F.)
 
            Here, the Court finds that
petitioners is not entitled to relief from dismissal. While some calendar
errors are excusable (see Nilsson v. City of Los Angeles (1967) 249
Cal.App.2d 976, 980), the purported calendar error invoked by petitioners in
this case is not.  Petitioners fail to
explain why, as of January 8, 2024—when the Court entered an order continuing
the trial setting conference—petitioners had not already filed the request for
hearing under Public Resources Code § 21167.4. The case was filed on November
17, 2023. Petitioners could have filed the request for hearing soon thereafter
to avoid subjecting their CEQA case to mandatory dismissal. To the extent that
petitioners were not ready to address the merits or were still waiting on the
administrative record, this would not have prevented petitioners from filing
the request for a hearing. The setting of the hearing would have occurred after
the request for hear was made, and the Court could have considered the need to
prepare the administrative record when setting the hearing. (County of
Sacramento v. Superior Court (2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 943, 951; Pub. Res.
Code § 21167.4(c).)
 
            Under the circumstances, the Court
questions whether petitioners’ counsel was even aware of the requirement to
request a hearing within 90 days of filing the petition. Petitioners’ counsel
does not aver to his practice of ensuring that the 90-day deadline is
calendared (to the extent that waiting close to the 90 days is ever justified).
Further, on April 2, 2024, when respondents’ counsel stated that respondents
may file a motion to dismiss, petitioners’ counsel does not indicate what he
understood respondents’ comment to the Court to mean. Petitioners’ counsel only
states that it was not apparent to him that the City was referring to the
§21167.4 notice requirement. (Slade Decl. ¶ 15.) Petitioners’ counsel does not
appear to appreciate the importance of complying with Public Resources Code §
21167.4. A reasonable attorney should understand that the request for hearing
must be filed or else a cause of action under CEQA is subject to mandatory
dismissal. Petitioners’ failure to file the request for hearing within 90 days
appears to be more than a mere mistake, but rather an unreasonable failure to
understand the statutory requirement. 
Indeed, it is notable that, during the 90-day period following the November
17, 2023 filing of the petition, numerous events occurred in this case to draw
counsel’s attention, including: (1) the Notice of Trial Setting Conference sent
from the Court to petitioners on November 27, 2023; (2) petitioners’ filing of
proofs of service on December 4, 2023; (3) the Notice of CEQA Settlement
Meeting filed and served on petitioner’s counsel on December 12, 2013; and (4) the
Stipulation between petitioners and respondents filed on January 8, 2024.  Whether or not a calendar notation indicating
the very last day to request a hearing was somehow omitted from counsel’s electronic
calendar, there were many events that triggered counsel’s obligation to
diligently ascertain the status of the case and learn no request for hearing
had yet been made.
 
            For
the foregoing reason, the Court finds that petitioners’ failure to file the
request for hearing within 90 days of filing the Petition was not excusable
neglect. Respondents’ Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED. Petitioners’ Motion for
Relief is DENIED. The first cause of action for CEQA is DISMISSED. 
 
IV.     Standard of Review
 
A.          
First Cause of Action for
Violations of CEQA[2]
 
In an action challenging an agency’s decision under
CEQA, the trial court reviews the agency’s decision for a prejudicial abuse of
discretion. (Pub. Res. Code § 21168.5.) “Abuse of discretion is
established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if
the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence.” (Ibid.)
 
“[S]ubstantial evidence includes fact, a reasonable
assumption predicated upon fact, or expert opinion supported by fact….
Substantial evidence is not argument, speculation, unsubstantiated opinion or
narrative, evidence that is clearly inaccurate or erroneous, or evidence of
social or economic impacts that do not contribute to, or are not caused by,
physical impacts on the environment.” (Pub. Res. Code § 21080(e).) Under the
substantial evidence test, the Court “review[s] the administrative record to see
if it contains evidence of ponderable legal significance that is reasonable in
nature, credible, and of solid value, to support the agency’s decision.” (Protect
Tustin Ranch v. City of Tustin (2021) 70 Cal.App.5th 951, 960.)  The Court does not weigh the evidence. (Ibid.)
 
When an appellant challenges “’the sufficiency of
the evidence, all material evidence on the point must be set forth and not
merely [its] own evidence.” (Toigo v. Town of Ross (1998) 70 Cal.App.4th
309, 317, quoting Jordan v. City of Santa Barbara (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th
1245, 1255.) The petitioner “must lay out the evidence favorable to the other
side and show why it is lacking.” (Defend the Bay v. City of Irvine
(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 1261, 1266.) “Failure to do so is fatal. A reviewing
court will not independently review the record to make up for appellant's
failure to carry his burden.” (Ibid.) 
 
B.          
Second and Third Causes
of Action Seeking Review of Approval of Conditional Use Permit
 
Under CCP § 1094.5(b),
the pertinent issues are whether the respondent has proceeded without
jurisdiction, whether there was a fair trial, and whether there was a
prejudicial abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion is established if the
agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the decision is not
supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence.
(CCP § 1094.5(b).)
 
“The issuance of a
conditional use permit is a quasi-judicial administrative action, which the
trial court reviews under administrative mandamus procedures pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 1094.5…. [T]he trial court reviews the whole
administrative record to determine whether the agency’s findings are supported
by substantial evidence and whether the agency committed any errors of law.
[Citations.]” (Neighbors in Support of Appropriate Land Use v. County of
Tuolumne (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 997, 1005.)
 
In applying the
substantial evidence test, “reasonable doubts must be resolved in favor of the
decision of the agency.” (Breakzone Billiards v. City of Torrance (2000)
81 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1244.) The trial court “may reverse an agency's decision
only if, based on the evidence before the agency, a reasonable person could not
reach the conclusion reached by the agency.” (Ibid.) Substantial
evidence is “relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate
to support a conclusion” (California Youth Authority v. State Personnel
Board (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 575, 584-85), or evidence of ponderable legal
significance which is reasonable, credible and of solid value (Kuhn v.
Department of General Services (1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1627, 1633).
 
“On questions of law
arising in mandate proceedings, [the court] exercise[s] independent judgment.’”
(Christensen v. Lightbourne (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 1239, 1251.) The
interpretation of statute or regulation is a question of law. (See State
Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Quackenbush (1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 65, 77.) However,
the “City's interpretation of its own City Code ‘is entitled to deference’ in
[the Court’s] independent review of the meaning or application of the law.” (City
of Monterey v. Carrnshimba (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1091. “Under
well-established law, an agency's view of the meaning and scope of its own ordinance
is entitled to great weight unless it is clearly erroneous or unauthorized.” (Friends
of Davis v. City of Davis (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1004, 1015.)
 
V.      Analysis of Writ Petition
            
A.          
Request
for Judicial Notice
 
Respondents’
request for judicial notice as to Exhibits B-G, sections of the Los Angeles
Municipal Code, and Exhibit K, Section 15301 of Title 14 of the California Code
of Regulations, effective October 6, 2005, to December 28, 2018, is GRANTED.
(Evid. Code § 452(b).)  
 
            With respect to respondents’
Exhibits A and H-J, the requests are GRANTED. (Rodas v. Spiegel (2001)
87 Cal.App.4th 513, 518 [records of administrative agencies judicially
noticeable under Evid. Code § 452(c)]; Shapiro v. San Diego City Council
(2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 904, 907, fn. 2 [taking judicial notice of city council
resolutions]; Evid. Code § 452(e) [judicial notice shall be taken of the “true
signification of all English words and phrases].) Petitioners cite Western
States Petroleum Assn. v. Superior Court (1995) 9 Cal.4th 559
for the assertion that extra-record evidence is not admissible. Western
States, however, “addressed challenges to agency action as either
unsupported by substantial evidence in the record, an abuse of discretion, or
arbitrary and capricious.” (Hill RHF Housing Partners, L.P. v. City of Los
Angeles (2021) 12 Cal.5th 458, 489, citing Western States, 9 Cal.4th
at 573, 574, 576.) Under such circumstances, the Supreme Court “concluded that
to allow extrarecord evidence in support of such claims would be contrary to
the deference associated with these standards of review.” (Hill RHF, 12
Cal.5th at 489.) “[E]xtra-record evidence can never be admitted merely to
contradict the evidence the administrative agency relied on in making a
quasi-legislative decision or to raise a question regarding the wisdom of that
decision.” (Western States, 9 Cal.4th at 579.) “The
interest in extending due deference to agency determinations that informed the
analysis in Western States does not carry the same weight with regard to”
claims where courts exercise independent judgment. (Hill RHF, 12 Cal.5th
at 489.) Because the interpretation of “school” under the LAMC and how expansion
of use under the Class 1 exemption under CEQA should be interpreted is a matter
of the Court’s independent judgment, the Court takes judicial notice of
Exhibits A and H-J. 
 
B.          
Request
to Augment Record
 
With
respect to Exhibits B (records from prior litigation) and C (real party’s past
code violations),[3]
the documents are not relevant to the definition of “school” under LAMC 12.14.U.24(c)
or whether the Project is categorically exempt under CEQA. (CCP § 1094.5(e)
[augmentation of record requires evidence to be relevant]; Mangini v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1057, 1063 [“Although a
court may judicially notice a variety of matters (Evid. Code, § 450 et seq.),
only relevant material may be noticed”].) Petitioners’ request to augment the
record, or alternatively take judicial notice of Exhibits B and C, is
DENIED.  
 
C.          
Authorization
of Conditional Use Permit Under Los Angeles Municipal Code
 
LAMC
§ 12.24.U[4]
sets forth the uses and activities that may be permitted if approved by the
CPC. (City RJN Ex. D at 31.) Section 12.24.U permits CUPs for schools as
follows: “(a) Public schools, elementary and high (kindergarten through 12th
grade)… (b) Private schools, elementary and high (kindergarten through 12th
grade)… (c) Private schools [other than elementary or high (kindergarten
through 12th grade) or nursery schools]….” (City RJN Ex. D at 37.) 
 
Petitioners
argue that the Project is not a “school” under § 12.24.U.24 because such a
designation is reserved for academic, scholastic entities. While subdivisions
(a) and (b) pertain to academic institutions, subdivision (c) is not so
limited. Indeed, subdivision (c) allows for CUPs to be issued to private
schools “other than elementary or high (kindergarten through 12th grade) or
nursery schools.” The LAMC does not evidence any intent to limit the definition
of school to academic institutions. 
Indeed, the carve out in subdivision (c) for private schools that are
not nursery schools, elementary schools, or high schools necessarily must refer
to non-academic schools.[5]

 
While
“school” is not defined in the LAMC, the Court refers to dictionary definitions
to ascertain the word’s ordinary, usual meaning. (George v. Susanville
Elementary School District (2024) 103 Cal.App.5th 349, 356.) “School” is
broadly defined to include an “organization that provides instruction” such as
“an institution for the teaching of children” or “an establishment offering
specialized instruction,” like a secretarial school or driving school. (City
RJN Ex. I at 92.) It is undisputed that the Project teaches children how to
swim, including reducing the risk of drowning and improving water safety
skills. (AR 8.) The Project both teaches children and provides specialized
instruction.

argue that the City is using the “private school” categorization to evade home
occupation regulation. Home occupation is defined as “[a]n occupation carried
on by the occupant or occupants of a dwelling as a secondary use in connection
with the main use of the property, subject to the regulations of Section 12.05
A.16” of the LAMC. (City Ex. B at 17 [§ 12.03]; see also City Ex. C at
21 [Conditions and Standards of Home Occupation in § 12.05.A.16].) 
 
CUPs
issued for “private schools” are still subject to the City’s regulation. No CUP
shall be granted unless the City finds that “the project’s location, size,
height, operations and other significant features will be compatible with and
will not adversely affect or further degrade adjacent properties, the
surrounding neighborhood, or the public health, welfare, and safety.” (City RJN
Ex. D at 26 [§ 12.24.E.2].) Before issuing a CUP, the City is also
required to find that “the project substantially conforms with the purpose,
intent and provisions of the General Plan, the applicable community plan, and
any applicable specific plan.” (City RJN Ex. D at 26 [§ 12.24.E.3].) In
approving a project, the City may also impose conditions that relate to the
interests set forth in the City’s findings. (§ 12.24.F.) Indeed, the City
conditioned real party’s CUP on limiting class size to three students,
operating from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Monday through Friday, and staffing class
times so that traffic for drop-off and pick-up are not compounded. (AR 3, 8.)
 
Accordingly,
petitioners’ hyperbolic assertion that the City could not have intended to
allow any commercial operation to constitute a “school” misses the point. The
City was entitled to prioritize school learning as a service that is “essential
or beneficial” to the community and city (see City RJN Ex. D at [§ 12.24.E.1])
and accordingly authorize issuance of a CUP subject to appropriate standards in
the City’s discretion. “Home occupations,” on the other hand, that do not involve
teaching and instruction (e.g., accounting, hair styling, etc.) are subject
to different conditions and standards than “private schools.” 
 
For
the foregoing reason, the plain meaning of “school” encompasses the Project. Petitioners
fail to show that the Project cannot be a school under section 12.24.U.24(c).[6]
 
D.          
Whether
Project is Exempted Under CEQA
 
1.           
Class 1 Exemption
 
Under CEQA, “[t]he lead agency has the burden to
demonstrate that a project falls within a categorical exemption and the
agency’s determination must be supported by substantial evidence.” (Citizens
for Environmental Responsibility v. State ex rel. 14th Dist. Ag. Assn. (2015)
242 Cal.App.4th 555, 568 [“CER”].) “‘[W]here the record contains
evidence bearing on the question whether the project qualifies for the
exemption … and the agency makes factual determinations as to whether the
project fits within an exemption category … [judicial review is] whether the
record contains substantial evidence to support the agency’s decision.”’ (Walters
v. City of Redondo Beach (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 809, 817.) The Court “do[es]
not weigh conflicting evidence, as that is the role of the public agency.” (Protect
Tustin Ranch, 70 Cal.App.5th at 960.)
            
“Since a determination that a project falls within
a categorical exemption excuses any further compliance with CEQA whatsoever, we
must construe the exemptions narrowly in order to afford the fullest possible
environmental protection.” (Save Our Carmel River v. Monterey Peninsula
Water Management Dist. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 677, 697.)
 
Respondents contend that the Project qualifies for
a Class 1 exemption to CEQA, codified in Title 14, Section 15301 of the
California Code of Regulations (hereinafter, “Guidelines”).[7]
“Class
1 consists of the operation, repair, maintenance, permitting, leasing,
licensing, or minor alteration of existing public or private structures,
facilities, mechanical equipment, or topographical features, involving
negligible or no expansion of existing or former use.” (Guidelines § 15301.) 
 
            The City justified the Class 1
exemption as follows: “The project consists of the continued use and operation
of a private swim school at a private residence…. The private swim school will
continue to operate towards the rear of the property at the existing swimming
pool…. The continued use of an existing swim school at a private residence
qualifies for a Class 1…Categorical Exemption. The use is an existing facility,
and its operation occurs within the site’s swimming pool.” (AR 21-22.) 
 
The
foregoing constitutes substantial evidence supporting the categorical
exemption. The dictionary defines “facility” as “something (such as a hospital)
that is built, installed, or established to serve a particular purpose.” (City
RJN Ex. J at 108.) A swimming pool is installed to facilitate swimming and
therefore qualifies as a “facility.” The swimming pool also existed when the
CUP application was sought. (AR 603, 1296.) The swimming pool therefore
qualifies as an existing facility under the Class 1 exemption. 
 
            The City also found that the CUP
involved negligible or no expansion of existing or former use. The City found
that the project “involves no physical construction/expansion of existing
structures or swimming pools.” (AR 22.) The record contains substantial
evidence supporting this conclusion. (AR 595 [testimony of City Planning
stating “There’s been no expansion, no new construction, no demolition.”], 603
[no new construction proposed].) 
 
            Petitioners argue that the swim
school is not an existing use because it was enjoined from operating in 2018. (AR
1121-26.) However, the Class 1 exemption allows for consideration of a “former
use” in determining whether a project involves negligible or no expansion of
use. Before real party applied for a CUP on July 31, 2018, he had operated the
swim school from 2011 until 2018. (AR 40, 1294-96.) The swim school thus qualifies
as a former use. 
 
            Petitioners also argue that the City
should have compared the proposed swim school to its use as a single-family
residence, because the CEQA analysis did not take place until after the initial
public hearing on October 25, 2022 (AR 37-56) and because the prior use as a
swim school was unpermitted. With respect to the proper basis for comparison, “[e]nvironmental
conditions may vary from year to year and in some cases it is necessary to
consider conditions over a range of time periods.” (Communities for a Better
Environment v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist. (2010) 48
Cal.4th 310, 327-28.) Indeed, the prior version of the Class 1 exemption required
“negligible or no expansion of use beyond that existing at the time of the lead
agency’s determination,” but the words “beyond that existing at the time of the
lead agency’s determination” were deleted to reflect that under case law “a
lead agency may look back to historic conditions to establish a baseline where
existing conditions fluctuate.” (City RJN Ex. A at 14.) “Neither CEQA nor the
CEQA Guidelines mandates a uniform, inflexible rule for determination of the
existing conditions baseline. Rather, an agency enjoys the discretion to
decide, in the first instance, exactly how the existing physical conditions
without the project can most realistically be measured, subject to review, as
with all CEQA factual determinations, for support by substantial evidence.” (Communities
for a Better Environment v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist.
(2010) 48 Cal.4th at 327-28.) Based on the swim school’s operation for eight
years, the City was entitled to consider such usage in determining that the CUP
would not involve more than a negligible expansion of use. 
 
            As for the fact that the swim school
was unpermitted for eight years, CEQA baseline determinations do not depend on
whether preexisting conditions may have been in violation of some statute or
regulation. (Citizens for East Shore Parks v. State Lands Com. (2011)
202 Cal.App.4th 549, 559 [“How present conditions come to exist may interest
enforcement agencies, but that is irrelevant to CEQA baseline
determinations—even if it means preexisting development will escape
environmental review under CEQA”]. 
 
            For the foregoing reasons,
substantial evidence supports the finding that the proposed swim school
constituting the Project is a facility that involves negligible
or no expansion of existing or former use. 
 
2.           
Unusual Circumstances Exception to Class 1
Exemption
 
“Once the agency establishes that the project is
exempt, the burden shifts to the party challenging the exemption to show that
the project is not exempt because it falls within one of the exceptions listed
in Guidelines section 15300.2.” (Citizens for Environmental Responsibility
v. State ex rel. 14th Dist. Ag. Assn. (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 555, 568.)
 
            Petitioners
argue that there is a reasonable possibility that the Project will have a
significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances. “A
categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a
reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the
environment due to unusual circumstances.” (CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2(c).)
 
The unusual circumstances exception may be
established in one of two ways. “A party invoking the exception may establish
an unusual circumstance without evidence of an environmental effect, by showing
that the project has some feature that distinguishes it from others in the
exempt class, such as its size or location. In such a case, to render the
exception applicable, the party need only show a reasonable possibility of a
significant effect due to that unusual circumstance. Alternatively…a party may
establish an unusual circumstance with evidence that the project will have a
significant environmental effect.” (Berkeley Hillside Preservation v. City
of Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1086, 1105.)
 
            Petitioners
do not show that the Project has some feature that distinguishes it from others
in the Class 1 exemption. Accordingly, petitioners cannot avail themselves of
the option to demonstrate “a reasonable possibility of a significant effect due
to that unusual circumstance.” (Ibid.)
 
Petitioners argue that the City made no finding
that the unusual circumstances exception was applicable, in which case the
Court must assume that the City found that the Project involved unusual
circumstances. (See Respect Life South San Francisco v. City of
South San Francisco (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 449, 458.) No such assumption is
necessary because the City did find that “there are no unusual
circumstances that indicate this project would reasonably result in a
significant effect on the environment.” (AR 23.) The City also found that the
Project “will not generate significant impacts regarding traffic, air quality,
water quality, or noise.” (AR 23.) The City notes that classes are limited to 3
students per class and 18 students per day spread out over 6 hours with no
classes during the winter. (AR 23.) The City also notes that Environment
Science Associates (“ESA”) recorded noise levels before and after swim class
and found that class resulted in 2.5 dBA, which is barely perceptible to the
human ear. (AR 23, 600.) Traffic concerns are addressed with a 15-minute buffer
between classes to facilitate drop-off and instructions to inform the parents
to park in real party’s driveway. (AR 44.) Neighbors have testified that the
noise from the swim school was not disruptive and that parking is not a problem.
(AR 617, 627, 688-90.) Substantial evidence supports the City’s finding that no
unusual circumstances would reasonably result in a significant effect on the
environment. 
 
            Petitioners also argue that substantial
evidence in the record supports a fair argument that the Project will have a
significant impact on the environment due to the existence of unusual
circumstances. While this standard may apply had the City failed to make any
findings concerning unusual circumstances (Respect Life, 15 Cal.App.5th
at 458), this is not the situation here. Petitioners must show substantial
evidence that the Project will have a significant environmental impact. (Berkeley
Hillside Preservation, 60 Cal.4th at 1105.)
 
            Petitioners
argue that the City did not consider the fire hazard that 18 additional cars
every weekday for 9 months of the year would pose to a narrow hillside street. However,
this speculation is insufficient to demonstrate that any additional traffic
from the swim school will result in a fire hazard. (Id. at 1104 [error
to hold that “a potentially significant environmental effect itself constitutes
an unusual circumstance”]; see also Walters v. City of Redondo Beach
(2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 809, 819-20.) 
 
            Petitioners
also maintain that the noise study was flawed because it was not conducted at
real party’s property, among other reasons. However, the Court does not weigh the
value of the study, as that was the role of the City in deciding whether to
approve the Project. (Protect Tustin Ranch, 70 Cal.App.5th at 960.) In
any event, even though noise samples were not recorded at the Project site, ESA
took the samples during a swimming lesson given by real party and compared them
to 50 hours of previously recorded swimming class footage taken at the Project
site. (AR 25-26.) ESA’s staff determined that the recorded noise levels were representative
of noise levels that occur during real party’s classes. (AR 26.) Even though
some neighbors have complained about noise, “‘in the absence of specific
factual foundation in the record, dire predictions by nonexperts regarding
the consequences of a project do not constitute substantial evidence.’
[Citation.] ‘Unsubstantiated opinions, concerns, and suspicions about a
project, though sincere and deeply felt, do not rise to the level of
substantial evidence.’” (Banker's Hill, Hillcrest, Park West Community
Preservation Group v. City of San Diego (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 249, 274.) Given
that a noise study supports the finding that the Project will not have a significant
impact on noise, in addition to other conditions imposed by the City to address
noise, such as the prohibition against amplified music or loud non-amplified
music (AR 4), subjective neighbor complaints do not constitute the type of
substantial evidence that would demonstrate the Project will have a significant
environmental impact. 
 
            Petitioners
fail to demonstrate that the “unusual circumstance” exception applies to the
Class 1 exemption.
