TENTATIVE RULING:
 
 
I.                  
MOTION FOR APPROVAL OF NINTH INTERIM REQUEST FOR
FEES
 
Receiver Pacific Crest Realty Advisors, LLC’s UNOPPOSED
Motion for Approval of Receiver’s Ninth Interim Request for Fees is GRANTED. 
 
Receiver Pacific Crest Realty Advisors, LLC moves for
approval of its interim fees incurred in the performance of its duties. 
 
Pursuant to the Order Appointing Equity Receiver and
Preliminary Injunction entered on 3/17/22, Receiver is authorized to prepare
“periodic interim statements reflecting the Receiver’s fees and administration
of the Receivership Estate.” (3/17/22 Receiver Order ¶ 11.) Receiver is
obligated to submit its fees and expenses to the Court for approval and
confirmation by way of a noticed interim request for fees, a stipulation among
the parties, or the Receiver’s final account and report. (Ibid.) 
 
Receiver seeks approval of $8,614.50 incurred in
April 2024. 
 
“Interim fees are subject to final review and approval by
the court. The court retains jurisdiction to award a greater or lesser amount
as the full, fair, and final value of the services rendered.” (Cal. Rule of
Court 3.1183(a).) “Unless good cause is shown, objections to a receiver’s
interim report and accounting must be made within 10 days of notice of the
report and accounting, must be specific, and must be delivered to the receiver
and all parties entitled to service of the interim report and accounting.” (Id.
Rule 3.1183(b).) No objections were received. 
 
A review of the invoice received in support of the motion
reveals that Receiver paid vendor invoices; tended to escrow logistics, inspection
issues, and completion of items in the buyer punch list for the property
located at 3500 W Manchester Blvd #421, as well as worked with counsel with
respect to litigation related to the property; tended to post-escrow activities
for the property located at 68160 Calle Cerrito, including disconnection of
utilities; and tended to removal of the property located at 816/818 N Mansfield
Avenue from the housing stock with the Los Angeles Housing Department. (Constantinescu
Decl. Ex. 1; 3/17/22 Receiver Order ¶ 3(b) [“The Receiver is granted the
following powers and duties…[t]o operate, manage, maintain, preserve, market,
and sell the Property, and to collect revenues, security deposits, storage
fees, income, issues, and profits thereof….”].) Receiver billed $295.00 per
hour for Sidney Constantinescu, $160.00 per hour for accounting tasks, and
$50.00 per hour for administrative tasks, rates which are permitted in the
March 17, 2022 order appointing Receiver. (3/17/22 Receiver Order ¶ 2(d).)
Having reviewed the supporting declaration and invoice, the Court finds that
the fees claimed by Receiver are reasonably related to the administration of
the Receivership Estate. 
 
The Court will sign the proposed order, electronically
received 7/9/24.

May 2024. No objections were received to this request.
 
A review of the invoice received in support of the motion
reveals that Receiver paid vendor invoices; tended to audit and reconciliation
of government agencies’ garnishment of receivership funds; reviewed demands for
lien payoffs; tended to escrow, post-closing logistics, and payoff of liens for
the property located at 3500 W Manchester Blvd #421, as well as worked with
counsel with respect to litigation related to the property; and tended to
removal of the property located at 816/818 N Mansfield Avenue from the housing
stock with the Los Angeles Housing Department, as well as continued lease
termination negotiations. (Constantinescu Decl. Ex. 1; 3/17/22 Receiver Order ¶
3(b) [“The Receiver is granted the following powers and duties…[t]o operate,
manage, maintain, preserve, market, and sell the Property, and to collect
