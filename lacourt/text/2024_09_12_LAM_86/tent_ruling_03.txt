[1]           The request for hearing was attached
to petitioners’ Motion to Relief filed on June 13, 2024. 


[2]           In the event it is later found that a
determination on the merits should have been made because this Court erred by
dismissing the first cause of action
for violations of CEQA and/or abused its discretion by declining to grant
relief from that dismissal, for judicial efficiency and economy, the Court will
addresses the cause of action at this time as an alternative basis for its
ruling in favor of respondents.
 


[3]           Petitioners withdraw their request to augment
the record with or take judicial notice of Exhibit A, their counsel’s October
22, 2022 letter. (Reply in support of Request to Augment at 2, fn. 1.)
 


[4]           All statutory references are to the
Los Angeles Municipal Code unless otherwise specified.
 


[5]           In advancing their interpretation that
“schools” must mean academic institutions, they necessarily must argue that subsection
(c) with its carve out refers to “Colleges and Universities.” (Reply at 5.)  It is illogical and unreasonable to conclude subsection
(c) was written so indirectly to refer to colleges and universities when it
could have said “colleges” and “universities,” much like it does with respect
to “nursery,” “elementary,” and “high” schools.


[6]           In the third cause of action,
petitioners allege that, even if the City had the authority to grant a CUP, the
City’s findings are not supported by substantial evidence. (Pet. ¶¶ 69, 70.) In
their opening brief, petitioners do not challenge the City’s findings in approving
the CUP. (See AR 8-10 [findings].) Petitioners therefore fail to meet
their burden with respect to the third cause of action. 
 


[7]           The City also found that the Project
was exempt from CEQA under Class 23. (AR 20.) The City does not attempt to
justify this exemption in the opposition.
