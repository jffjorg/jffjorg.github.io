And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

This Tentative Ruling addresses the petitioners' Motion to Relief, which was filed on June 13, 2024. The petitioners argue that the court erred in dismissing the first cause of action for violations of CEQA and/or abused its discretion by declining to grant relief from that dismissal. The court finds that it will consider the merits of the case and determine if the City erred in dismissing the first cause of action. The court also notes that the petitioners did not challenge the City's findings in approving a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) for the Project. The court concludes that the petitioners failed to meet their burden with respect to the third cause of action, which alleges that the City's findings are not supported by substantial evidence.
