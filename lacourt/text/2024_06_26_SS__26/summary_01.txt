And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's motion for relief from waiver of objections and privileges is granted. The defendant had filed a request for production of documents, but failed to serve a timely response due to excusable neglect by defense counsel. The court found that the defendant's waiver of objections was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and therefore exercised its discretion to relieve the defendant from the waiver. The defendant's motion is granted, and the defendant is allowed to demand production of documents.
