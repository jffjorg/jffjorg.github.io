Chic v. Rodriguez, et al.MOTION FOR
RELIEF FROM WAIVER OF OBJECTIONS
(CCP § 2031.300)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant Angela Diaz’s Motion for Relief from Waiver of Objections and
Privileges to Demand for Production of Documents, Set One, is GRANTED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiffs Ana Chic and Engeline
Chic (“Plaintiffs”) filed the instant action for motor vehicle negligence
against Defendant Angela Rodriguez
(“Defendant”) on June 27, 2023. Defendant filed an Answer on November 17, 2023.  
 
On April 19, 2024, Defendant
filed the instant Motion for Relief from Waiver of Objections and Privileges to
Demand for Production of Documents, Set One. No opposition has been filed to
date. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant moves for relief from waiver of objections and
privileges to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 2031.300, which states in relevant part: 
 
The party to whom the demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied:
 
(1) The party has subsequently served a
response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220,
2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280.
(2) The party's failure to serve a
timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) In support of the
Motion, defense counsel declares that following service of the Request for
Production of Documents, Set One, on November 27, 2023, the attorneys agreed to
multiple extensions of the time to respond while defense counsel located their
client. (Motion, Nason Decl., ¶¶3-5.) The last agreed-upon deadline for service
of responses by Defendant was February 16, 2024 but defense counsel needed one
further extension to obtain verified responses. (Id. at ¶5,) However,
the request for the final extension was inadvertently not emailed until the
following business day, February 19, 2024. (Ibid.) On February 28, 2024,
Defendant served verified responses in substantial compliance with sections
2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280. (Id. at ¶7 and
Exh. 2.) 
 
This evidence
demonstrates that Defendant’s waiver of objections were the result of excusable
neglect of defense counsel. (See Carli v. Superior Court (1984) 152
Cal.App.3d 1095, 1099.) Nor has Plaintiff made any opposition to this Motion.
Therefore, the Court exercises its discretion under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.300, to relieve Defendant from the waiver of objections. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Angela Diaz’s Motion for Relief from Waiver of Objections and
Privileges to Demand for Production of Documents, Set One, is GRANTED. 
 
Moving party to give
notice.
