  Case Number:  22STCV30431    Hearing Date:   October 17, 2023    Dept:  34 PLAINTIFF'S
REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT 
 
 
I.         
BACKGROUND
 
On September 16, 2022, Plaintiff Californian II Homeowners Association
filed its Complaint against Defendant Regina Sarfaty. 
 
On March 3, 2023, Plaintiff amended its Complaint to substitute Doe 1
with Frank G. King. 
 
On August 7, 2023, by request of Plaintiff, the Clerk’s Office entered
default on Defendant Regina Sarfaty. 
 
On September 8, 2023, by request of Plaintiff, the Clerk’s Office
entered default on Defendant Frank G. King. 
 
On October 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed:
 
(1)      
Memorandum
of Points and Authorities;
(2)      
Declaration
of Bryce McLaughlin;
(3)      
Declaration
of Matthew A. Gardner; and
(4)      
Proposed
Judgment.
 
On October 11, 2023, by request of Plaintiff, the Clerk’s Office
dismissed the remaining Doe defendants from the Complaint. 
 
II.      
ANALYSIS
 
a.         
Damages
 
The Complaint prays for damages in “the total sum of $27,954.65 for
homeowner’s association assessments, late fees, attorneys’ fees and costs,
collection fees, and interest thereon.” (Complaint, ¶ 4.) Thus, the total
amount that can be requested for those items up until the point of the filing
of the Complaint is $27,954.65. 
 
In its Proposed Judgment, Plaintiff prays for $23,100.00 in principal
(one form of damages) and $2,280.00 in fines (another form of damages). This is
acceptable because the combined amount ($25,380.00) is less than the total
amount of such damages requested in the Complaint. 
 
 
b.         
Interest

 
                                     
i.    Pre-filing 
 
Homeowners’ associations are allowed by law to charge 12% annual
interest rates on delinquent assessments (commencing 30 days after the
delinquent assessments become due). (Civ. Code, § 5650, subds. (a), (b)(3),
(c). The Court has not been made aware of any agreement for a lower interest
rate. (Civ. Code, § 5650, subd. (b)(3).) Thus, the appropriate interest rate
here is 12% per year. 
 
However, Plaintiff’s Counsel declares that “[t]he total interest
charged to the account between May 1, 2017 through present day is $10,044.93.”
(Decl. Gardner, ¶ 10.) The Complaint was filed on September 16, 2022. However, an
allowance of this entire amount would far exceed the damages limit of
$27,954.65 that was requested in the Complaint. 
 
The difference between $27,954.65 (the total amount of damages claimed
in the Complaint, which included interest accrued from May 1, 2017 to September
16, 2022) and $25,380.00 (the amount of damages from principal and fines
combined) is $2,574.65. The Court will award that amount of interest for the
pre-filing period. 
 
                                   
ii.    Post-filing 
 
Regarding the post-filing period, the remaining calculation is simple.
The total amount of interest for post-filing period (based on an interest rate
of 12% on $27,954.65 in damages for the 396 days between September 16, 2022 and
the date of this Order) is $3,639.47. That amount of interest for the
post-filing period will also be awarded. 
 
c.         
Attorney's
fees and costs 
 
Plaintiff did not provide a Judicial Council Form MC-010, Memorandum of
Costs (Summary). However, it appears
that costs were incurred in the amount of $682.66. (Decl. Gardner, Exh. C, pp.
2–3.) The Court will award the $650.11 in costs requested in the Proposed
Judgment. 
 
Regarding attorneys’ fees, Plaintiff argues: (1) that this case does
not fall within the ambit of California Rules of Court, rule 3.740(a) (which
involves collections cases); (2) that Los Angeles County Superior Court Local
Rule, rule 3.214(a) does not apply to this case; and (3) that the Court should
award reasonable attorney’s fees in the amount of $3,508.00. (Memorandum, pp.
7:15–28, 8:1–19; Decl. Gardner, ¶ 18.) 
 
The Court agrees that this case is not covered by California Rules of
Court, rule 3.740(a). That rule only covers “an action for recovery of money
owed in a sum stated to be certain that is not more than $25,000, exclusive of
interest and attorney fees”. In contrast, this case is for $25,380.00 in
damages and fines. 
 
The rest of the arguments are irrelevant. The amount of attorney’s fees
allowable for a default judgment of $31,594.12 (which is the combined amounts
of the principal damages, fines damages, and total allowable interest) is
$1,337.82. Upon consideration of the work done in this matter (which was simple
and uneventful) and the invoices submitted (which appear to include excessive billing),
the Court finds that $1,337.82 is a reasonable amount of attorney’s fees.
(Decl. Gardner, Exh. C, pp. 1–2.) The Court will award $1,337.82 in attorney’s
fees, which is both reasonable for the amount of work done since the filing of
the Complaint and the amount allowable for a default judgment under the local
rules. 
 
The Request for Default Judgment is GRANTED in part. The Court AWARDS
default judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants, jointly and
severally, in the total amount of $33,582.05.
