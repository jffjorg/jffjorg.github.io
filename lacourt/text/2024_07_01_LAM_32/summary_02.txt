And here is the summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to strike and demurrer filed by Defendant Costco Wholesale Corporation. The Plaintiff, Fernando Barajas-Salomon, filed a product liability action against various defendants, including 101 Granite Countertop LLC and Costco Wholesale Corporation. The Plaintiff alleges that he was exposed to silica-containing stone products and developed lung disease as a result of the exposure. The Plaintiff also alleges that the defendants concealed the hazardous nature of their products.

The Judge has ruled that the Plaintiff has adequately pled causation under the Bockrath standard and that the complaint adequately pleads punitive damages. The Judge has also ruled that the motion to strike is granted as to the phrase "and other silica-containing stone products to be identified during the course of discovery" because the catchall allegation in the complaint would allow the Plaintiff to base liability on unidentified products, thereby failing to apprise the defendants of the basis for the claims in the manner required by Bockrath.

The Judge has overruled the demurrer filed by the Defendant Costco Wholesale Corporation and denied its motion to strike the punitive damages claim. The matter is set for hearing on July 1, 2024.
