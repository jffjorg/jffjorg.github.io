Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Defendant Continental Casualty Company's demurrer to the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint is sustained without leave to amend. The judge finds that the Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged a breach of contract claim against Continental Casualty Company, as the allegations in the complaint reveal that Continental Casualty Company satisfied its contractual obligation by releasing the funds to MK Diamond. The judge also finds that the Plaintiff has not pled that Continental Casualty Company actually breached the insurance policy, and that the Plaintiff has failed to allege any underlying claim or unfair or fraudulent conduct by Continental Casualty Company. The judge notes that the Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged his standing as a third-party beneficiary, but that this does not necessarily mean that Continental Casualty Company had a duty to pay the Plaintiff directly. The judge concludes that the Plaintiff's claims for breach of contract, negligence, and unfair business practices are without merit and must be dismissed.
