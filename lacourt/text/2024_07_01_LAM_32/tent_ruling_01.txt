     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant continental casualty company’s
  demurrer to first amended complaint 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On December 28, 2023, Plaintiff
Anthony Haag filed this action against Defendants MK Diamond Products, Inc. (MK
Diamond), Brian Delahaut (Delahaut), and CNA Financial Corporation (CNA
Financial). The parties have stipulated to Continental Casualty Company
(Continental) substituting in for CNA Financial. The dispute arises from the
following allegations.  
The complaint asserts twelve causes of
action arising from a settlement agreement reached as part of an employment
discrimination action filed by Plaintiff. Plaintiff entered the settlement
agreement with Defendants MK Diamond and Delahaut. Pursuant to the contract, MK
Diamond and Delahaut agreed to pay $93,750 to Plaintiff and $143,750 to
Plaintiff’s attorneys in exchange for Plaintiff releasing his claims. MK
Diamond and Delahaut had an insurance policy with Continental, which disbursed
the funds. MK Diamond and Delahaut thereafter issued a check to Plaintiff.
Plaintiff alleges that the check bounced and that Defendants failed to reissue
a check or otherwise make payment despite giving assurances. Plaintiff alleges
that Defendants have so far only paid him $16,000. 
On April 17, 2024, the Court sustained
Continental’s demurrer on the grounds that Plaintiff failed to allege a legal
basis under which Continental had a duty to directly pay Plaintiff the
insurance proceeds from the policy between Continental and MK Diamond.
Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint on May 17, 2024.  
On May 31, 2024, Continental filed the
instant demurrer to the FAC. Plaintiff filed his opposition on June 17, 2024. Continental
filed its reply on June 21, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether a
pleading states a cause of action or defense. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the
pleading or by proper judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd.
(a).) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior
Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the pleading, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action or defense. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
MEET AND CONFER
Before filing a demurrer or a motion to
strike, the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the
party who filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the
motion to strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be
reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.)
The Court notes that Defendant has complied with the meet and confer
requirement. (See Hodous Decl.)
DISCUSSION
I.
Breach of Contract
            a. Third-Party Beneficiary
Ordinarily, “[s]omeone who is not a party
to the contract has no standing to enforce the contract.” (Hatchwell v. Blue
Shield of California (1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 1027, 1034.) “Because the
insurer's duties flow to its insured alone, a third party claimant may not
bring a direct action against an insurance company.” (Shaolian v. Safeco
Ins. Co. (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 268, 271.) However, “[t]here are several
exceptions to the general rule which prohibits a third party claimant from
suing an insurer.” (Harper v. Wausau Ins. Corp. (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th
1079, 1086.) One exception is enumerated in Insurance Code section 11580, under
which a claimant becomes a third-party beneficiary of an insurance policy upon
a final judgment against the insured. (Ibid.) “Further, a claimant may
sue the insurer as a third party beneficiary utilizing traditional contract
principles,” such as that enumerated in Civil Code section 1559. (Ibid.)  
Civil Code section 1559 provides that “[a]
contract, made expressly for the benefit of a third person, may be enforced by
him at any time before the parties thereto rescind it.” (Civ. Code, § 1559.) A
non-signatory may bring a breach of contract claim as a third-party beneficiary
if he establishes the following: (1) he is likely to benefit from the contract;
(2) a motivating purpose of the contracting parties was to benefit the third
party; and (3) allowing the third-party claim is consistent with the objectives
of the contract and the reasonable expectations of the contracting parties. (Goonewardene
v. ADP, LLC (2019) 6 Cal.5th 817, 821.)    
            Here, Plaintiff alleges that he was
“the sole and exclusive beneficiary of the settlement payment” and that he “belongs
to the class of persons whose benefit the contract was made,” i.e., “employees
who bring employment claims against MK DIAMOND and BRIAN DELAHAUT.” (FAC ¶¶ 51,
55.) These ultimate facts must be accepted as true on a demurrer. Whether
Defendants truly intended to benefit Plaintiff in the policy is a question of
fact. (See Jackson v. Aetna Life & Casualty Co. (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d
838, 846 [“Although respondent argues that there is no evidence indicating that
either Morris or Aetna intended to benefit Jackson by their contract, that
issue is a question of fact to be determined at trial”].) For pleading
purposes, Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged his standing as a third-party
beneficiary.
            b. Continental’s Breach
            While Plaintiff has pled his
standing, he has not pled that Continental actually breached the insurance
policy. Rather, the allegations in the FAC reveal that Continental satisfied
its contractual obligation by releasing the funds to MK Diamond. Although
Plaintiff may have been an intended beneficiary of this transaction, that does
not mean the contract required Continental to pay Plaintiff directly. None of
the facts alleged in the FAC, nor the incorporated exhibits, support an
inference that the policy required Continental to pay Plaintiff directly.
Therefore, the breach of contract claim fails as a matter of law.  
II.
Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
“Only one with the right to sue an
insurance company for contract damages for breach of the insurance policy can
also sue the insurance company for tort damages for breach of the covenant of
good faith.” (Wexler v. California FAIR Plan Assn. (2021) 63 Cal.App.5th
55, 62.) As discussed above, Plaintiff has failed to allege a breach of
contract claim. Therefore, he cannot maintain the derivative implied covenant
claim.  
III.
Negligence
The elements of
negligence are: (1) a duty to exercise ordinary care; (2) breach of that duty;
(3) causation; and (4) damages. (Ladd v. County of San Mateo (1996) 12
Cal.4th 913, 917.) “Whether a duty exists is a question of law to be determined
by the courts.” (Lake Almanor Associates L.P. v. Huffman-Broadway Group,
Inc. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1205.) “[C]ourts are reluctant to impose
duties to prevent purely economic harm to third parties.” (Ibid.) 
The negligence
claim is based on Plaintiff’s allegation that Continental failed to directly
pay Plaintiff the insurance proceeds. (See FAC ¶¶ 175-176.) However, Plaintiff
cites no authority supporting the existence of a duty under the circumstances
alleged here. Therefore, the negligence claim fails.
IV. Unfair
Business Practices
            Business
and Professions Code section 17200 prohibits unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent
business acts or practices. Each of the three prongs is an independent basis
for relief. (Smith v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. (2001)
93 Cal.App.4th 700, 718.) UCL actions alleging unlawful conduct “borrow” from
other statutes or common law causes of action outside Section 17200. (Klein
v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1342, 1383.)
            As
discussed above, Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged any underlying claim.
Plaintiff has also failed to allege any unfair or fraudulent conduct by
Continental. Therefore, the UCL claim fails as well.  
CONCLUSION
            Defendant
Continental
Casualty Company’s demurrer is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
