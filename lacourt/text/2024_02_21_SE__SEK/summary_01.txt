```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's unopposed application for attorney's fees is granted in the amount of $43,832.00. The judge has also awarded costs in the amount of $6,124.60, as sought in the Memorandum of Costs. The court has determined that the plaintiff has established an entitlement to reasonable attorney's fees and costs based on the facts and circumstances of the case. The court has reviewed the declarations of attorneys Khajadourian and Alexander and finds that the plaintiff's fees are reasonable and should be paid out of the common fund (defendant's share of the sale proceeds). The court has noted that defendant has failed to articulate any substantive basis for not awarding fees and costs, and has therefore granted the plaintiff's motion.
