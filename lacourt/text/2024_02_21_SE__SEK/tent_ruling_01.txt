  Case Number:  22NWCV00372    Hearing Date:   February 21, 2024    Dept:  SEK BURROW v. CLARKCASE NO.:  22NWCV00372
Plaintiff’s unopposed Application for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED in the amount
of $43,832.00. Costs are awarded in the amount
as sought in the Memorandum of Costs in the amount of $6,124.60.
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
Code of Civil
Procedure §874.010 provides that the costs of partition “include: (a)
[r]easonable attorney’s fees incurred or paid by a party for the common
benefit…” (CCP §874.010(a).) In determining whether to award attorney’s fees,
whether the services in question are for the common benefit must be decided on
the facts and circumstances in each case. Nevertheless, the case authorities
hold that attorney’s fees may be awarded for litigating contested issues in
partition actions if that litigation is integral to the partition action.
Moreover, “the court shall apportion the costs of partition among the parties
in proportion to their interests or make such other apportionment may be
equitable.” (CCP §874.040.)
 
The Court is limited
to only awarding a reasonable fee, and to fees incurred in the partition action
itself which benefit all the property owners—costs are not included. (CCP
§874.010(a).) 
 
Here, the parties are
engaged in ongoing litigation in an effort to dispose of the Subject Property
jointly owned, such that the instant partition action is in the common interest
of both parties. Plaintiff has established an entitlement to attorney’s fees. 
 
When
assessing the amount of any attorney’s fee award, courts typically determine
what is reasonable through the application of the “lodestar” method. Under the
lodestar method, a base amount is calculated from a compilation of (1)
time reasonably spent and (2) the reasonable hourly
compensation of each attorney. (Serrano v. Priest (“Serrano
III”) (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 48); (See also Meister v. Regents of
University of California (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 437, 448-449 holding
that the lodestar method applies to statutory attorney fees award unless the
underlying statute provides for another method of calculation).  Normally,
a “reasonable” hourly rate is the prevailing rate charged by attorneys of
similar skill and experience in the relevant community. (PLCM Group, Inc. v.
Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) That amount may then be
adjusted through the consideration of various factors, including “(1) the
novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in
presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded
other employment by the attorneys, and (4) the contingent nature of the fee
award.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) The Court is vested with discretion to
determine which claimed hours were reasonably spent, and what an attorney’s
reasonable hourly rate is. (Dover Mobile Estates v. Fiber Form Products, Inc.
(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 1494, 1501); (See also Flannery v. California Highway
Patrol (1987) 61 Cal.App.4th 629, 644.) [“We readily acknowledge the
discretion of the trial judge to determine the value of professional services
rendered in his or her court.”]. 
 
Plaintiff’s
motion seeks an award of $43,832.00 in attorney’s fees. A review of the
declarations of Attorneys Khajadourian and Alexander in
support of the motion indicate that Plaintiff is seeking to recover fees at the
rate of $400/hr. 
 
As of
February 5, 2024, no Opposition has been filed with this Court. As such, Defendant fails to articulate any substantive basis
as to why this Court should not award Plaintiff attorney’s fees in the amount
sought under CCP §874.010.
 
The Court has reviewed Attorneys Khajadourian and
Alexander’s declarations  and finds that Plaintiff has established an
entitlement to reasonable fees in the amount of $43,832.00, to be paid
out of the common fund (Defendant’s share of the sale proceeds). The Court’s
determination is undertaken in the exercise of its discretion to determine
whether or not rates or hours are reasonable. (Dover Mobile Estates v.
Fiber Form Products, Inc. (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 1494, 1501.) 
 
Plaintiff filed a Memorandum of Costs on
November 7, 2023 (served U.S. Mail on November 7, 2023). Pursuant to CRC
Rule 3.1700(b)(1), “[a]ny notice of motion to strike or tax costs must be
served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum.”  “The failure to file a motion to tax costs
constitutes a waiver of the right to object.” (Douglas v. Willis (1994)
27 Cal.App.4th 287, 289.) “After the time has passed for a motion to strike or
tax costs or for determination of that motion the clerk must immediately enter
the costs on the judgment.” (CRC Rule 3.1700(b)(4).) 15 calendar days from
November 7, 2023 is November 22, 2023. 
As of February 5, 2024, no Motion to Strike or Tax Costs has
been filed. 
 
Costs are awarded in the amount of
$6,0124.60, as sought in the Memorandum of Costs. The Court notes that
Plaintiff’s Subject Motion seeks costs in the amount of $8,019.60, which
exceeds the amount prayed for the Memorandum of Costs on file with this Court.
