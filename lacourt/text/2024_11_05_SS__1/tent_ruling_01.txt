  Case Number:  23STCV02717    Hearing Date:   November 5, 2024    Dept:  1 Moving
Party:             Plaintiff Mayeli
Becerra and Defendant BluSky Restoration Contractors, LLC 
Ruling: GRANT                    
 
Plaintiff Mayeli
Becerra (Plaintiff) and defendant BluSky Restoration Contractors, LLC
(Defendant) jointly request that the Court approve their stipulation to settle
Plaintiff’s claims under the Private Attorney General Act (PAGA).  Plaintiff’s operative First Amended Complaint
(FAC) asserts that Defendant violated sections 201, 202, 203, 204, 206, 206.5,
207, 210, 216, 218, 218.6, 221, 223, 226, 226.7, 256, 510, 512, 558, 1174,
1174.5, 1194, 1197, 1197.1, and 1198 of the Labor Code.  
 
 
Legal Standards
 
Under Labor Code section 2699(l)(2): “The superior court
shall review and approve any settlement of any civil action filed pursuant to
this part. The proposed settlement shall be submitted to the agency at the same time that it is submitted to the court.”  (Lab. Code.
§2699(l)(2); see Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 549
[noting in passing that “PAGA settlements are subject to trial court review and
approval, ensuring that any negotiated resolution is fair to those
affected.”)  However, “[t]he standards for review [for court approval of a
representative PAGA action settlement] are unclear, however, because the trial
court does not have a fiduciary responsibility to any absent class members as
it does in reviewing class action settlements.”  (The Rutter Group, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Proc.
Before Trial, Ch. 14-D, ¶12:250; see also Haralson v. U.S. Aviation Services
Corp. (N.D. Cal. 2019) 383 F.Supp.3d 959, 971 [“[N]either the California
legislature, nor the California Supreme Court, nor the California Courts of
Appeal, nor the [Labor and Workforce Development Agency (the “LWDA”)] has
provided any definitive answer as to what the appropriate standard is for
approval of a PAGA settlement.”].)  A court may exercise its discretion to
approve a settlement of a suit that includes a PAGA claim even if no portion of
the settlement is allocated toward payment to the LWDA. (See Nordstrom Com.
Cases (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 576, 589.)   
 
Given that California case authority on the issue is
somewhat sparse, the Court looks to a federal district court case, Haralson
v. U.S. Aviation Services Corp. (N.D. Cal. 2019) 383 F.Supp.3d 959, for
guidance on court approval of PAGA settlements.  In Haralson, the
court noted that the rationale behind the statute’s court approval requirement
is that settlement of PAGA claims compromises a claim that could otherwise be
brought by the state.  (See Haralson, supra, 383 F.Supp.3d at
971.)  The court noted that the LWDA has provided the following
guidance:  “It is thus important that when a PAGA claim is settled, the
relief provided for under the PAGA be genuine and meaningful, consistent with
the underlying purpose of the statute to benefit the public and, in the context
of a class action, the court evaluate whether the settlement meets the
standards of being ‘fundamentally fair, reasonable, and adequate’ with
reference to the public policies underlying the PAGA.  (Haralson,
supra, 383 F.Supp.3d at 971.)  
 
The courts have also considered payment of civil penalties
as a factor in approval of PAGA settlements.  (See Flores v. Starwood
Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (C.D. Cal. 2017) 253 F.Supp.3d 1074,
1077 [federal district court approved PAGA settlement where court was satisfied
that the parties' settlement was “fair and adequate in view of the purposes and
policies of the statute” and the parties “adequately divvied up the civil
penalties under Section 2699(i) of the California Labor Code.”].)  However, payment
of civil penalties is not dispositive.  (See Nordstrom Com. Cases,
supra, at 589.)  
 
Background
 
This case was originally a
class action.  On September 13, 2023, the
Court granted Plaintiff’s request for dismissal of her class claims, leaving
only claims for statutory penalties under PAGA. 
This stipulation for settlement approval followed.

1.     
Notice to the LWDA
 
Labor Code
section 2699(l)(2) requires that the settlement be provided to the Labor Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) at the same time it is presented to
the court.  Plaintiff apparently provided notice to the LWDA on October 11,
2024.  (Koulloukian Decl., ¶ 25, Ex. 3.)  
 
2.     
Fairness of the Settlement
 
a.     
Presumption of
Fairness
 
Under
Dunk v. Ford Motor Co. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1794, a
presumption of fairness exists where “(1) the settlement is reached through
arm's-length bargaining; (2) investigation and discovery are sufficient to
allow counsel and the court to act intelligently; (3) counsel is experienced in
similar litigation; and (4) the percentage of objectors is small.”  (Id. at 1802.)  
 
The
settlement agrees to have been reached through arm’s-length bargaining.  The settlement was reached following an
all-day mediation with Eve Wagner, Esq., in preparation for which the parties
exchanged various documents and information and Plaintiff consulted an
expert.  (Koulloukian Decl., ¶ 10.)  Specifically, Plaintiff obtained Defendant’s
employee handbooks, written policies, and a random 20% sample of time and pay
records for the aggrieved employees, as well as data on all aggrieved employees
overall.  (Id., ¶ 13.)  The settlement is presumptively fair.
 
b.     
Breadth of Release
 
The
release in the settlement agreement applicable to aggrieved employees reads:
 
5.2. Release by Settlement Group
Members and State of California: In consideration for their awarded portions of
the Settlement Group Allocation, as of the date the Settlement becomes Final
and is fully funded as set forth in Paragraph 4.3, the State of California and
all Settlement Group Members release any and all claims under PAGA for civil
penalties against BLUSKY and the other Released Parties that arise out of or
reasonably relate to the allegations asserted in the Operative Complaint and
the PAGA Notice submitted by Plaintiff to the LWDA pursuant to PAGA that,
during the PAGA Period, BLUSKY failed to: pay all wages due, including minimum
wages and overtime; provide meal and rest periods; pay meal and rest period
premiums at the regular rate of pay; maintain accurate records; furnish
accurate itemized wage statements; timely pay all wages due during employment;
and pay all wages due upon separation of employment (the “Released PAGA
Claims”). The Released PAGA Claims include but are not limited to claims
brought under California Labor Code sections 200-204, 206, 207, 210, 216, 218,
218.5, 221, 223, 226, 226.7, 256, 510, 512, 558, 1174, 1174.5, 1194, 1197,
1197.1, 1198, and 2698 et seq. All Settlement Group Members will release the
Released PAGA Claims and receive a Settlement Share.
This release is
appropriately narrow to include only claims under PAGA, and only those based on
or reasonably relating to the allegations of the LWDA notice and the FAC, which
bound the scope of this litigation.  The
Court will approve it.
c.      
Amount of Attorney
Fees and Costs
 
The
settlement provides for $86,658 in attorney
fees, approximately one-third (33.33%) of the gross settlement amount.  This is appropriate considering the result
achieved and the Court will approve it.  
 
Counsel requests the capped amount of $15,000 in litigation
costs.  These costs appear reasonably
incurred and reasonable in amount, and the Court will approve them.  
 
The
settlement allocates up to $4,000 for settlement administration costs to Phoenix
Class Action Administration Solutions.  This
is reasonable in amount and the Court will approve it.  
 
d.     
Gross
Settlement Amount
 
The $260,000 settlement represents penalties
for 7,405 pay periods worked by 223 employees. 
This is a little more than $35.11 per pay period and approximately $1,165.91
per employee, prior to attorney fees and costs. 
This appears a reasonable amount.
 
e.      
Division
of Civil Penalties
 
“[C]ivil penalties recovered by aggrieved
employees shall be distributed as follows: 75 percent to the Labor and
Workforce Development Agency for enforcement of labor laws, including the
administration of this part, and for education of employers and employees about
their rights and responsibilities under this code, to be continuously
appropriated to supplement and not supplant the funding to the agency for those
purposes; and 25 percent to the aggrieved employees.”  (Labor Code § 2699(i).)
 
For the reasons discussed above, the amount
of civil penalties does not appear to be correct.  The Court expects that a further settlement
agreement will correctly allocate the penalties between the LWDA and aggrieved
employees. 
 
f.       
Funding
of Settlement 
 
Under the settlement, Defendant will fund
the settlement within 15 days of the administrator’s transmission of the wiring
instructions, which will be about 18 days after the Court enters judgment.  (Kolloukian Decl., Ex. 1, ¶¶ 1.7, 4.3.)  Payments will be made to aggrieved employees
and for other disbursements within 7 days after that.  (Id., ¶ 4.4.)  Uncashed checks will be canceled and the
funds transmitted to the Unclaimed Property Fund of the State Controller in the
name of the aggrieved employee payee.  These
are all acceptable terms and will be approved. 
 
g.     
Service
Awards and Individual Settlements
 
Plaintiff requests a service award of $7,500.  This is reasonable in amount considering the
length of this case and the work by Plaintiff and will be approved. 
 
Conclusion
 
For the foregoing reasons, the stipulation
for approval of PAGA settlement is granted. No appearance is required on
November 5, 2025.  Plaintiff’s
proposed order and judgment will be entered forthwith with a non- appearance
date of May 5, 2025 for receipt of final report reflecting that all settlement
funds have been disbursed.
