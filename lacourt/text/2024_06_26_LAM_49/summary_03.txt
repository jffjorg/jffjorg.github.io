And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike parts of the plaintiff's complaint seeking punitive damages. The defendant argued that the complaint lacks sufficient facts to support an award of punitive damages, and the judge agrees. The plaintiff has failed to allege specific facts showing the requisite malice, oppression, or fraud necessary to seek punitive damages. The judge has not yet decided whether to grant leave to amend the complaint, but will consider it if the plaintiff can make a sufficient offer of proof that a successful amendment could be made consistent with this ruling.
