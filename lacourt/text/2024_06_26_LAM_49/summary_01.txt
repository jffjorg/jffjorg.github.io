Significant Statements:

* The demurring party has not included a declaration reflecting the parties met and conferred.
* The court considers the meet and confer obligation satisfied based on the parties' representation.
* The defects in the pleading must be apparent on the face of the pleading or by proper judicial notice.
* Rescission is not available because Plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law—damages for breach of contract.
* Defendant had the contractual right to abate rent under the circumstances alleged.
* Plaintiff's allegations of breach fail as a matter of law.

Summary:
The judge's tentative ruling sustains defendant's demurrer to the first cause of action (rescission of contract) without leave to amend, sustains defendant's demurrer to the second cause of action (breach of contract) with 30 days leave to amend, and overrules defendant's demurrer to the third cause of action (declaratory relief). The court finds that rescission is not available because plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law, and that defendant had the contractual right to abate rent under the circumstances alleged.
