  Case Number:  23LBCV00468    Hearing Date:   May 23, 2024    Dept:  S25 Procedural BackgroundOn March 14, 2023, Plaintiff Bryan Wayne Boone (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant Union Pacific Company (“Defendant”) for damages under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act, 45 U.S.C. §51. Plaintiff alleges causes of action for (1) negligence, (2) negligence per se, (3) Locomotive Inspection Act, and (3) res ipsa loquitur.On October 23, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with Form Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories, Sets One. (Simpson Decl., ¶2, Exh. A.) After the parties agreed to an extension of the deadline for responses, on December 18, 2023, Plaintiff served responses to the interrogatories. (Simpson Decl., ¶¶3-5, Exh. D.) On January 12, 2024, Defendant sent meet and confer correspondence regarding the responses, and on February 13, 2023, Plaintiff served supplemental responses to the interrogatories. (Simpson Decl., ¶¶6-7, Exhs. E-F.) Defendant sent another meet and confer correspondence and the parties extended the deadline for the instant motions to April 26, 2024. (Simpson Decl., ¶¶11, 14, Exhs. J, M.) Plaintiff has not supplemented the responses.On April 26, 2024, Defendant filed these Motions to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories, Nos. 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, and 12.7, and to Special Interrogatories nos. 42, 45, 49, 66, 67, 69, and 70. To date, Plaintiff has not filed opposition to either motion.Analysis“Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (a), a court may order a party to serve a further response to an interrogatory when the court finds that: “(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete[;] (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate[; or] (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.” The burden is on the responding party to justify any objection or failure to fully answer the interrogatories. (Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subds. (b), (c).) Failure to timely respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product, unless “[t]he party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance” and “[t]he party’s failure to serve atimely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subds. (a)(1), (a)(2).)FORM INTERROGATORIESOn October 23, 2023, Defendant propounded Form Interrogatories, Set One (“Form Interrogatories”) to Plaintiff alongside other discovery requests. (Simpson Decl., ¶ 2. Exh. A.) After two extensions, Plaintiff served his unverified responses to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories on December 18, 2023. (Simpson Decl., ¶¶ 3-5, Exhs. B-D.)Defendant sent a meet-and-confer letter to Plaintiff detailing what Defendant viewed as inadequate responses to written discovery. (Simpson Decl., ¶ 6, Exh. E.) Counsels for both sides met and conferred for a month until Plaintiff supplemented his responses on February 13, 2024. (Simpson Decl., ¶ 7, Exh. F.) Even so, Plaintiff did not provide supplemental responses to Form Interrogatories Nos. 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, & 12.7 as requested in the January 12, 2024 meet-and-confer letter. The parties continued to meet and confer over the next few months and Plaintiff extended the motion to compel deadline to April 26, 2024. (Simpson Decl., ¶¶ 9-12, Exhs. H-K.) To date, Defendant has still not received responses to FORM INTERROGATORIES Nos. 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, & 12.7. Plaintiff filed no opposition, however, previously objected to all the above listed Form Interrogatories on the grounds of attorney-client privilege and the work product privilege.For FORM INTERROGATORY No. 12.2, Defendant claims that the interrogatory only asks for basic information concerning interviews conducted about the incident. Defendant points out that FORM INTERROGATORY No. 12.2 does not ask Plaintiff or Plaintiff’s counsel to disclose their impressions of the interview, nor does it ask what the person being interviewed said during their interview.FORM INTERROGATORY No. 12.3. Defendant asserts that it is entitled to a supplemental and substantive response due to existing case law. “[W]itness statements procured by an attorney are not automatically entitled as a matter of law to absolute work product protection . . . [and] must be determined case by case.” (Coito v. Superior Court (2012) 54 Cal.4th 480, 495-496.) “An attorney resisting discovery of a witness statement based on absolute privilege must make a preliminary or foundational showing that disclosure would reveal his or her ‘impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal research or theories.”’ (Ibid.) Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not made the requisite showing to resist discovery of a witness statement.FORM INTERROGATORY No. 12.4. Defendant states the interrogatory merely asks for basic information concerning photographs, films, or videotapes that Plaintiff or anyone on his behalf took of any place, object, or individual regarding the incident or Plaintiff’s injuries. Defendant reiterates that it is not asking for Plaintiff or Plaintiff’s counsel’s impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal research or theories about these documents.FORM INTERROGATORY NO. 12.7. Defendant states FORM INTERROGATORY No. 12.7 also asks for basic information about the date of any inspection conducted of the scene and the contact information of whoever conducted the inspection. Defendant points out that the interrogatory does not call for Plaintiff’s counsel to disclose impressions of any inspection conducted.Defendant argues that FORM INTERROGATORY Nos. 12.2, 12.4, and 12.7 are crucial for Defendant to defend itself and that it has a right to know basic information of the alleged incident that is the subject of this lawsuit. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition and, thus, has not made any arguments disputing Defendant’s assertions. The Court finds Defendant is entitled to further responses to Form Interrogatories Nos. 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, and 12.7, without objection, within 15 days of this hearing.SPECIAL INTERROGATORIESSPECIAL INTERROGATORY No. 42. Requests an itemized statement of damages Plaintiff attributes to the alleged incident; however, Plaintiff objects that the interrogatory calls for an expert opinion and responds by simply referring to his responses in his form interrogatories. Defendant argues that response does not call for an expert opinion, rather it merely asks for an itemized statement of damages. The court overrules Defendant’s objection as to expert opinion. “Answers [to interrogatories] must be complete and responsive. Thus, it is not proper to answer by stating ‘See my deposition,’ ‘See my pleading,’ or ‘See the financial statement.’” (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App,3d 771, 783-784.) “Answers must be complete and responsive.” (Id. at 783.) Defendant has merely referred Plaintiff to the form interrogatory responses rather than providing a complete and responsive answer.SPECIAL INTERROGATORY No. 45. Seeks the identity of Plaintiff’s health care providers. Plaintiff objects that the interrogatory is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The phrase "reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence" makes it clear that the scope of discovery extends to any information that reasonably might lead to other evidence that would be admissible at trial. (See Lipton v. Superior Court (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1611.) The court finds the request reasonably calculated to lead to evidence that would be admissible at trial. Such evidence could be used to determine if any of the alleged injuries already existed before the alleged August 6, 2021 incident.SPECIAL INTERROGATORY No. 49. Request seeks information concerning an application of claim for benefits under a policy of insurance. The Court finds such information could be admissible and introduced at trial to demonstrate whether Plaintiff’s health insurance covered any medical expenses resulting from his alleged injuries. Second, Plaintiff’s right to privacy must be balanced against Defendant’s right to obtain discovery of the existenceand contents of a plaintiff’s liability insurance coverage. (See Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 552.) Because Plaintiff’s injuries are at issue in this lawsuit, Defendant has a strong interest in information related to insurance claims, which outweigh Plaintiff’s privacy concern. Again, Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the instant motion.SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES No. 66 and 69. Plaintiff responds to these interrogatories by simply stating “Plaintiff refers to his medical records.” Defendant contends that Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230 which calls for “the preparation or the making of a compilation, abstract, audit, or summary of or from the documents” is not applicable here. Defendant reasons that these interrogatories simply call Plaintiff to state all facts related to his allegations of incidental and “related” expenses. Moreover, Defendant argues that it should not be forced to subpoena records, rely on third parties, and sift through documents on the belief that Plaintiff intended to refer to in its interrogatory response. Again, Plaintiff failed to file an opposition.SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES 67 and 70. Defendant suggests Plaintiff’s responses are evasive and insufficient. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition disputing Defendant’s characterization of his responses.Tentative RulingHaving read Defendant’s moving papers and separate statements and recognizing Plaintiff failed to oppose the motions, the Court orders GRANTS Defendant’s motions and order (1) Plaintiff to provide further responses to FORM INTERROGATORIES Nos. 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, and 12.7, without objection, within 15 days of this hearing and (2) Plaintiff to provide further responses to SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, Nos. 42, 45, 49, 66, 67, 69, and 70, without objection, within 15 days of this hearing.
