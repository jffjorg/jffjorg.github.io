And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has granted the defendants' motion to strike parts of the complaint, including the request for injunctive relief. The court has also granted the defendants' request for judicial notice. The court has denied the plaintiffs' claim for punitive damages and has withdrawn the punitive damages claim subject to seeking leave to amend under Code of Civil Procedure Section 425.14 at a later date. The court has held that injunctive relief is unavailable to a successor-in-interest and that the plaintiffs may maintain a civil action under California Health & Safety Code § 1430(b) but may not seek injunctive relief.
