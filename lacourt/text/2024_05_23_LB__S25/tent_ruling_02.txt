 Case Number:  24LBCV00380    Hearing Date:   May 23, 2024    Dept:  S25 BackgroundPlaintiffs Rose Hovsepian, by and through her Successor in Interest, Victor Hovsepian, as an individual (“Plaintiffs”) bring this action against Providence Health System – Southern California dba Providence Little Company of Mary Subacute, Providence Health Care & Services (“hereinafter Defendants”), et al., alleging the following causes of action: (1) Negligence/Willful Misconduct; (2) Elder Abuse and Neglect; (3) Violation of Patients’ Bill of Rights; and (4) Wrongful Death.On April 26, 2023, Plaintiff Rose Hovsepian (“Rose”), passed away while under the care of Defendants’ skilled nursing facility (“Facility”). Rose, who was over the age of 65, was admitted to the Facility on January 23, 2023, after unsuccessful treatment at other facilities, for long term rehabilitation for pneumonia. Despite Defendants’ assurances to provide continuous supervision and monitoring of Rose, Plaintiffs alleged Rose passed away because of a perforation in the soft tissue of her upper trachea (undetected by Defendants) which ultimately led her to bleed profusely for an unknown period. Consequently, Rose aspirated on her blood and was eventually found deceased in her room by her son, Victor Hovsepian.On April 18, 2024, Defendants filed a Motion to Strike portions of the complaint seeking to strike:(1) Plaintiffs’ Request for Injunctive Relief (Compl., ¶ 88; p. 28, Plaintiffs’ Prayer for Relief, ¶ 11; and Exhibit A to the Complaint); and(2) Plaintiffs’ Claim for Punitive Damages (Compl., ¶ 71; p. 27, Plaintiffs’ Prayer for Relief, ¶ 4; p. 28, Plaintiffs’ Prayer for Relief, ¶ 7; p. 28, Plaintiffs’ Prayer for Relief, ¶ 12.)Request for Judicial NoticeThe Court grants Defendants’ Request for Judicial Notice as to Exhibits 3, 4, 5 and 6 attached to the Declaration of Michael T. Mertens. (Evid. Code, §§ 451, 452, subd. (c).)The Court grants Plaintiffs’ Request for Judicial Notice as to Exhibit A and B to the Plaintiffs’ Request to Judicial Notice. (Evid. Code, §§ 451, 452, subd. (c).)Motion to Strike – Punitive DamagesIn their opposition, Plaintiffs withdrew the punitive damages claim subject to a potential 425.14 at a later date.Motion to Strike – Injunctive ReliefCalifornia Health & Safety Code § 1430(b) provides:“A current or former resident or patient, or the legal representative, personal representative, or successor in interest of a current or former resident or patient, of a skilled nursing facility, as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 1250, or intermediate care facility, as defined in subdivision (d) of Section 1250, may bring a civil action against the licensee of a facility who violates any rights of the resident or patient as set forth in Section 72527 or 73523 of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations, or any other right provided for by federal or state law or regulation.”Defendants concede Plaintiffs may pursue a civil action under Health and Safety Code § 1430(b), Defendants contend California case law limits a former resident’s access to injunctive relief where a plaintiff is either deceased or has moved to another facility and does not seek to return. (Jarman v. HCR ManorCare, Inc. (2020) 10 Cal.5th 375, 401 (injunctive relief is unavailable for residents who change facilities or pass away during the pendency of the suit); see Mou v. SSC San Jose Operating Company LP (2019) 415 F.Supp.3d 918, 932-933 (plaintiffs’ injunction request rendered moot because plaintiffs were former residents who had already been discharged and were not seeking readmission)).In response, Plaintiffs relies on the plain, unambiguous language of Health & Safety Code, § 1430(b), which allows for a “successor in interest” to “bring a civil action.” Citing Shuts v. Covenant Holdco LLC (2012) 208 Cal. App. 4th 609, 625, Plaintiffs argue “California law clearly and unambiguously grants current and former residents of skilled nursing facilities an absolute right to have their claims for statutory damages and injunctive relief decided “in a court of competent jurisdiction.” Thus, Plaintiffs conclude Rose’s successor-in-interest has the right to bring a claim for injunctive relief for the purpose of compelling compliance with state nursing standards. Plaintiff also notes Defendants’ reliance on Jarman is misplaced as the quoted language is found in Justice Cuellar’s dissenting opinion and, at best, is dicta.Article III of the federal constitution “restricts federal courts to the resolution of cases and controversies.” (Mou v. SSC San Jose Operating Co. LP (2019) 415 F. Supp. 3d 918, 932–33, citing Davis v. Fed. Election Comm'n (2008) 554 U.S. 724, 732.) “A case becomes moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.” Id., (citing McQuillion v. Schwarzenegger (9TH Cir. 2004), 369 F.3d 1091, 1095). For example, an inmate's transfer to a different facility moots his claims for injunctive relief against the inmate's former facility. Id. In Mou, the court determined that “although section 1430(b) allows a former resident to seek injunctive relief, Plaintiff's claim for injunctive relief is moot. As Defendants point out, Plaintiff has already been discharged and is not seeking readmission into [the facility].” Ibid.The Court agrees with the reasoning applied in the Mou decision and in the Jarman dissent. Here, Plaintiffs may maintain a civil action pursuant to California Health & Safety Code § 1430(b). However, injunctive relief, e.g. to gain readmission or prevent the same violation occurring again to that individual, is relief unavailable and inapplicable to a successor-in-interest.TENTATIVE RULINGPlaintiffs’ Claim for Punitive Damages (Complaint, ¶ 71; p. 27, Plaintiffs’ Prayer for Relief, ¶ 4; p. 28, Plaintiffs’ Prayer for Relief, ¶ 7; p. 28, Plaintiffs’ Prayer for Relief, ¶ 12 is WITHDRAWN by Plaintiffs subject to seeking leave to amended under Code of Civil Procedure Section 425.14 at a later date.The Court GRANTS Defendants’ Motion to Strike without leave to amend Plaintiffs’ Prayer for Injunctive Relief on page 28, ¶ 11, of the Complaint. The rest of the relief sought in Plaintiffs’ Prayer on the Third Cause of Action (page 28, ¶ 9, 10) remains.
