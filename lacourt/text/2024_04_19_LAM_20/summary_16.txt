And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the Defendant's Motion to Quash Service of Summons, as the Plaintiff has adequately shown that service was properly rendered at the Defendant's business address upon a receptionist. The Defendant, J.K. Residential Services, Inc., had argued that service was not properly rendered, but the judge finds that the service was in compliance with California Code of Civil Procedure section 415.20(a). The judge notes that substitute service on entity defendants, such as the Defendant, may be affected by leaving the summons with secretaries, receptionists, or other persons apparently in charge of the premises. As a result, the Motion to Quash is denied, and the Defendant is ordered to file an answer within 20 days.
