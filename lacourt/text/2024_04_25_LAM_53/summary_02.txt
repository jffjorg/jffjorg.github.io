And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Maritime Business Ventures, Inc., requested a court judgment by default against defendants Larry Bracco and Jennifer Bracco. However, the court found that the plaintiff failed to comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, by submitting a declaration of nonmilitary status that does not state whether the defendants are in military service or whether the plaintiff is unable to determine whether they are in military service. Therefore, the court denied the plaintiff's request for court judgment by default without prejudice to the plaintiff filing new default judgment documents that comply with the California Rules of Court.
