  RE:
 
plaintiff’s request for court judgment by
  default
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Maritime Business
Ventures, Inc.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:        n/a       
Request for Court Judgment by Default
Plaintiff Maritime Business
Ventures, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed, on March 6, 2024, default judgment
documents in support of its request for court judgment by default against
defendants Larry Bracco and Jennifer Bracco (“Defendants”). 
The court, however, notes a
defect with Plaintiff’s request for default judgment against Defendants. 
Pursuant to California Rules
of Court, rule 3.1800, Plaintiff is required to submit “[a] declaration of
nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is sought[.]”  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1800, subd.
(a)(5).)  Under the Servicemembers Civil
Relief Act (50 U.S.C. § 3901 et seq.), in any civil action in which the
defendant does not make an appearance, before entering judgment for the
plaintiff, the court “shall require the plaintiff to file with the court an
affidavit” that either (1) states “whether or not the defendant is in military
service and show[s] necessary facts to support the affidavit[,]” or, (2) “if
the plaintiff is unable to determine whether or not the defendant is in
military service, stat[es] that the plaintiff is unable to determine whether or
not the defendant is in military service.” 
(50 U.S.C. § 3931, subds. (a), (b)(1).) 
The declaration of nonmilitary
status made in Plaintiff’s request for default judgment states only that
Plaintiff’s counsel “do[es] not know that Defendants are not in the U.S.
military service[.]”  (CIV-100,
¶ 8.)  The court finds that this statement
does not comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800 or the
Servicemembers Civil Relief Act because it does not state (1) whether
Defendants are in military service or (2) whether Plaintiff is unable to
determine whether they are in military service. 
(Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(5); 50 U.S.C. § 3931,
subds. (a), (b)(1).) 
The court therefore denies
plaintiff Maritime Business Ventures, Inc.’s request for court judgment by
default against defendants Larry Bracco and Jennifer Bracco, without prejudice
to plaintiff Maritime Business Ventures, Inc.’s filing new default judgment
documents that comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
