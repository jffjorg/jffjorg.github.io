And here is a summary in English text:

The Plaintiff, Kasandra Macias, filed a complaint against the Defendants, DO & CO Los Angeles, Inc. and Express Services, Inc., alleging violations of California labor laws. The Defendants filed a motion to compel arbitration of the Plaintiff's individual PAGA claim and to stay the Plaintiff's representative PAGA claim pending the completion of arbitration.

The Court considered the motion, opposition, and reply, and found that the Defendants met their burden to demonstrate the existence of an arbitration agreement between the parties. The Court also found that the claims in the complaint are covered within the scope of the arbitration agreement.

The Plaintiff argued that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable as unconscionable, citing procedural and substantive unconscionability. However, the Court found that the agreement was not procedurally unconscionable, as it was a standalone document that highlighted the arbitration provision, and that the Plaintiff failed to demonstrate substantive unconscionability.

The Court granted the motion and compelled the Plaintiff's individual PAGA claim to arbitration and stayed the Plaintiff's representative PAGA claim pending the completion of arbitration. The Court set a status conference for January 6, 2025, to review the status of the arbitration.
