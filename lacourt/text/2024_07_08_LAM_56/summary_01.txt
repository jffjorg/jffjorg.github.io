And here is a brief English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled in favor of the defendant's demurrer, sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend. The court finds that the Federal Court has exclusive jurisdiction to interpret and enforce the settlement agreement, and that the plaintiff's allegations in the complaint do not state a valid cause of action. The court also finds that the plaintiff's attempt to enforce the settlement agreement in state court would pose a significant risk of frustrating the Federal Court's jurisdiction over the consent judgment. Therefore, the court has sustained the demurrer and dismissed the case without prejudice.
