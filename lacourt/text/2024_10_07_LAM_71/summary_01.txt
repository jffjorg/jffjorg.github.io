And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies defendant Liberty Mutual Insurance's motion for monetary sanctions against plaintiffs' counsel, Joseph M. Kar and Law Office of Joseph M. Kar, PC, in the amount of $40,150. The judge finds that the doctrine of the tort of another could apply to a UIM arbitration, and that plaintiffs' counsel believed in good faith that this doctrine applied. The judge also notes that the safe harbor procedure under C.C.P. §128.7 and §128.5 was not followed, and that the motion was improperly filed. The judge concludes that defendant's request for sanctions is denied, and that plaintiffs' request for sanctions is also denied. The judge advises both parties to accept the outcome of the case to avoid incurring additional costs and taking up judicial resources.
