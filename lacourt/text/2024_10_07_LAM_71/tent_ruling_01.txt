 Hearing Date:  October 7, 2024



 

Defendant
Liberty Mutual Insurance’s motion for monetary sanctions against Plaintiffs’
counsel Joseph M. Kar and Law Office of Joseph M. Kar, PC, jointly and
severally, is denied.
Plaintiffs’
request for sanctions is denied.
 
Defendant Liberty Mutual Insurance (“Liberty”)
(“Defendant”) moves for monetary sanctions against Plaintiffs Jesse Rios’
(“Rios”) and Lydia Rodriguez’s (“Rodriguez”) counsel, Joseph M. Kar and Law
Office of Joseph M. Kar, PC (collectively, “Plaintiffs’ Counsel”), jointly and
severally in the amount of $40,150.  (Amended
Notice Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§128.7, 128.5.)
 
          Legal Standard
          An attorney or unrepresented party who
presents a pleading, motion or similar paper to the court makes an implied
“certification” as to its legal and factual merit; and is subject to sanctions
for violation of this certification.  (C.C.P.
§128.7; see Murphy v. Yale Materials Handling Corp. (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th
619, 623.)
          A C.C.P. §128.7 motion involves a
two-step process.  The moving party first
serves the sanctions motion on the offending party without filing it. The
opposing party then has 21 days to withdraw the improper pleading and avoid
sanctions (the so-called “safe harbor” waiting period). At the end of the
waiting period, if the pleading is not withdrawn, the moving party may then
file the motion.  (C.C.P. §128.7(c)(1); Primo
Hospitality Group, Inc. v. Haney (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 165, 173-174; Martorana
v. Marlin & Saltzman (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 685, 698-699; see
Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Structured Asset Sales, LLC (2022) 75 Cal.App.5th
596, 605-606 [sanctions motion improperly filed where issue (objectional
document) was resolved during safe harbor period].)
In all
civil cases, the judge may order a party or counsel, or both, “to pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by another party as a
result of actions or tactics, made in bad faith, that are frivolous or solely
intended to cause unnecessary delay.”  (C.C.P.
§128.5(a).)
          The safe harbor provisions of C.C.P.
§128.7 do not apply to most of C.C.P. §128.5; however, under the 2017 amendment
to C.C.P. §128.5, a safe harbor procedure almost identical to that in §128.7 is
available for making or opposing a written motion or the filing and service of
a complaint, cross-complaint, answer or other responsive pleading that can be
withdrawn or appropriately corrected.  (C.C.P.
§128.5(f)(1)(B), (D); Nutrition Distribution, LLC v. Southern Sarms, Inc.
(2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 117, 127-130.)
A Court
must consider “whether a party seeking sanctions has exercised due diligence.”  (C.C.P. §128.5(f)(1).)
“Frivolous”
means either: (1) “totally and completely without merit”; or (2) “for the sole
purpose of harassing an opposing party.”  (C.C.P. §128.5(b)(2); see Marriage of
Flaherty (1982) 31 Cal.3d 637, 649-650.)
 
Discussion
Defendant’s
request for sanctions is denied under C.C.P. §§128.5 and 128.7.
Plaintiffs’
counsel believed in good faith that the doctrine of the tort of another could
apply to a UIM arbitration regardless of whether the underlying action
permitted fees, costs, or interest.
Counsel
for Plaintiffs and Defendant are advised to accept the outcome of the instant
case to avoid incurring additional costs for future litigation in this matter and
taking up this Court’s scarce judicial resources.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s request for sanctions is denied.
Plaintiffs’ request for sanctions is denied.
Moving Party to give notice.
