And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling regarding a future court hearing. The judge notes that, according to California law, the parties must meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference to determine if an agreement can be reached to resolve the objections that will be raised in the defendant's demurrer. The demurrer is expected to be filed by the defendant and combines multiple causes of action and bases for demurrers, which the judge finds to be procedurally improper. The judge advises the defendant to review CRC Rule 3.1320(a) and the Rutter Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial to correct the format of their demurrer.
