The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for a default judgment and has set a hearing to determine why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or the plaintiff's counsel should be sanctioned. The reasons for the denial are: 1) the request for court judgment was not properly submitted, 2) the complaint was not dismissed as to a Doe defendant, and 3) the evidence submitted does not support the amount of damages claimed. The hearing is set for November 8, 2024, at 8:30 AM at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse. The judge is also imposing a penalty of $250 on the plaintiff's counsel for failing to enter the default judgment in a timely manner.
