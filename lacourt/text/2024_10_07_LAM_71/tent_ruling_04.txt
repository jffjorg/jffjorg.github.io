          Plaintiffs Virginia
Diaz (“Virginia”) and Juan Diaz (“Juan”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) move to
compel the deposition of Defendant Ford Motor Company’s (“Ford”) (“Moving
Defendant”) Person(s) Most
Knowledgeable (“PMK”).  (Notice of
Motion, pg. 1; C.C.P. §2025.450(a).)  Plaintiffs
request sanctions against Defendant and its counsel of record, Mortenson
Taggart Adams LLP, in the amount of $3,035.00, on the basis Defendant willfully,
intentionally, and
unjustifiably
failed to comply with the relevant code section(s) of the Discovery Act.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 1; C.C.P. §2025.450(g)(1).)
Having reviewed Plaintiffs’ Motion to
Compel Defendant’s PMK to Attend and Produce Documents at Deposition, the Court
rules as follows.
On September 1, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their original
complaint.  On February 1, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their first amended
complaint (“FAC”) against Moving Defendant and Non-moving Defendant Bob
Wondries Motors dba Bob Wondries Ford (“Bob Wondries”) (collectively,
“Defendants”) alleging three causes of action: (1) violation of Song-Beverly
Act- breach of express warranty; (2) fraudulent inducement- concealment; and
(3) negligent repair.  (See FAC.)
On May 14, 2024, Plaintiffs served a Notice of Deposition of Defendant’s
PMK and Custodian(s) of Records, with the deposition to take place on July 9,
2024.  (Decl. of Powell ¶3, Exh. A.)  On July 3, 2024, Defendant served a list of
objections to the Notice of Deposition, which stated that Defendant would not
be presenting a witness on the date and time of the noticed deposition.  (Decl. of Powell ¶5, Exh. C.)
On July 9, 2024, Defendant’s PMK failed to appear at the noticed
deposition, so Plaintiffs’ counsel recorded the nonappearance.  (See Decl. of Powell ¶6, Exh. B.)
On August 20, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion.  Defendant
filed its opposition on September 23, 2024. 
Plaintiffs filed their reply on September 30, 2024.
The Court grants Plaintiffs’ motion
pursuant to C.C.P. §2025.450 and orders Defendant’s PMK to appear for
deposition and produce the requested documents within 20 days.  Plaintiffs have demonstrated good cause to
order Defendant to produce a PMK witness and the requested documents.
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions
totaling $3,035.00 against Defendant and its counsel.
          The
Court awards sanctions against Defendant and its counsel, jointly and
severally, pursuant to C.C.P. §2025.450(g)(1) in the total amount of $3,035.00, calculated as follows:
($425/hour x 7 hours) = $2,975.00 for
attorney’s fees
$2,975.00 + $60.00 filing fee = $3,035.00
in fees and costs
Sanctions are payable within 20 days.

deposition of Defendant’s PMK and produce the requested documents is
granted.  Defendant is to produce its PMK
for deposition within 20 days of this ruling.
Plaintiffs’ request for
sanctions against Defendant and its counsel of record, jointly and severally, is
granted in the total amount of $3,035.00.  Sanctions are due within 20 days of this
ruling.
