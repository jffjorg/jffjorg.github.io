Section 430.41, which mandates a meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by
video conference, curiously not [by] email or letter, to determine
whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the Demurrer, to be filed by Defendant in this matter.”  (Decl. of Hermes ¶2, emphasis added.)


[2] The Court notes Defendant also combines multiple
causes of action and bases for demurrers in each section of its motion.  The format of Defendant’s demurrer is
procedurally improper; Defendant is advised to review CRC Rule 3.1320(a) and
related secondary sources, such as the Rutter Guide: Civil Procedure Before
Trial.
