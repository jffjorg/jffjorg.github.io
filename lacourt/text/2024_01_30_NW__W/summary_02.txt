And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to vacate the default judgment against them. The defendants argued that they were not properly notified of the action and that their former counsel, James S. Bell, PC, was not informed of the case, leading to their failure to respond to the complaint. However, the judge found that the defendants' declaration was insufficient to show that they were unaware of the case or that they suffered excusable neglect.

The judge also denied the defendants' motion to quash the writs of execution entered on March 15, 2023, in Sacramento County and July 27, 2023, in Los Angeles County. The writs of execution were entered as a result of the default judgment against the defendants, and the judge ruled that the defendants' motion to vacate the default judgment was denied, making the motion to quash the writs of execution moot.

The judge's ruling is based on the defendants' failure to meet the statutory requirements for seeking relief from a default judgment under Code of Civil Procedure Section 473(b). The judge also found that the defendants' claim that their former counsel was not informed of the case was not relevant to the motion, and that the defendants failed to explain why their manager of legal services, Tina Sohne, was unavailable for eight months after her medical leave.
