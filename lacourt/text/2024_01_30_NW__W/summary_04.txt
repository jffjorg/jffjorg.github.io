And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer by Defendant Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. to the complaint filed by Plaintiff James Griffiths. The court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the complaint fails to state a cause of action under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. The court has found that the complaint does not plead facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action under the Magnuson-Moss Act, as it does not allege that the Plaintiff attempted to informally resolve the dispute before filing the complaint or that the Defendant failed to comply with the Federal Trade Commission rules.

The court has also granted the Defendant's request for judicial notice of the Status Certificates issued by California's Department of Consumer Affairs to Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. certifying the company's compliance and ability to operate a state-certified arbitration program in California.

The court has denied the Defendant's motion to strike the second cause of action, as the demurrer has been sustained with leave to amend. The court has given the Plaintiff an opportunity to amend the complaint to cure the deficiencies identified in the demurrer.
