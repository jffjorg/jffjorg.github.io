And here is the English summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge W Acevedo in the case of Acevedo et al. v. Chauvapun et al. The defendants, Joe Potchanard Chauvapun, M.D., Urgentpoint, Inc., and Urgentpoint Health, P.C., have moved to compel Karina Carvajal-Frakt, AMFT, to comply with a deposition subpoena for business records. The defendants argue that the records are relevant to the subject matter of the litigation and are vital to their development of defenses to the plaintiff's claims. The plaintiff, Alejandra Acevedo, opposes the subpoena, arguing that it is overbroad and seeks to limit the scope of the subpoena to records that are directly relevant to her treatment related to her husband's death. The court has conducted an in-camera review of the records and finds that all of the records relate to treatment the plaintiff received after her husband's death, as part of counseling relating to her grief. The court grants the defendants' motion and orders that the records be produced in unredacted format.
