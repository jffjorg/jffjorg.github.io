And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint, specifically the allegations of punitive damages. The court finds that the complaint fails to plead specific facts that support a claim for punitive damages, which are typically awarded for intentional torts. The complaint alleges that the defendants were negligent or grossly negligent in letting the dog escape without a leash, but lacks specific facts that establish that the defendants' conduct was so despicable that it warrants the imposition of punitive damages. The court grants the motion with leave to amend, allowing the plaintiff to replead the allegations of punitive damages.
