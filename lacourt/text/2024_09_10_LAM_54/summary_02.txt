And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, PG Imtech of California, LLC, has moved for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication in a lawsuit against defendants Kathleen M. Saylor and Patricia A. Marrero. The lawsuit arises from a lease agreement that allows the plaintiff to purchase the property from the defendants, but the parties have failed to agree on a purchase price and have obtained separate appraisals. The plaintiff argues that the defendants breached the lease by obtaining an appraisal that did not value the property in its current condition, and that the lease requires the appraiser to consider the present condition of the property, including the lease. The defendants argue that their appraisal correctly removed the lease from the valuation because if the property was sold to the plaintiff, the lease would terminate.

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication, holding that the plaintiff has not met its burden of showing that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court found that the lease does not state whether the lease itself must or must not be considered in determining the fair market value of the property, and that the plaintiff's interpretation of the lease is not supported by authority. The court also noted that the plaintiff's appraisal contemplates a hypothetical situation in which the property is being sold to a third party, ignoring the fact that the property is being sold to the leaseholder.
