Here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has considered the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant Thien Pham, but declines to consider the substantive arguments presented. The demurrer and motion rely on evidence outside the pleadings and do not articulate a basis for their consideration after the earlier unsuccessful challenge to the legal sufficiency of the Complaint. The Court overrules the demurrer and denies the motion. Additionally, the Court strikes the First Amended Complaint (FAC) as it was improperly filed. The FAC was filed after the window for filing an amended pleading without leave of court or stipulation had closed. The Court finds that the Complaint remains the operative pleading.
