Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 



AND
RELATED CROSS-ACTION
 
MOVING
PARTY: Defendant/Cross-Complainant JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“Moving
Defendant”) 
 
The
Court has considered the moving papers.  No
opposition papers were filed.  Any
opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at least nine
court days before the hearing under California Code of Civil Procedure section
1005, subdivision (b).
 
BACKGROUND
The
currently operative first amended complaint (the “FAC”) alleges: (1) breach of
partnership agreement; (2) breach of fiduciary duty; (3) misrepresentation
(fraud); (4) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (5)
declaratory relief; (6) unjust enrichment; (7) negligence; (8) constructive
trust; and (9) accounting.  
 
On
November 3, 2023, Moving Defendant filed a demurrer (the “Demurrer”) to the
seventh of action for negligence on the grounds that the FAC fails to state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. 
 
REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
            Defendants’ Request for Judicial
Notice is GRANTED as to the documents and their legal effect, but not to the
truth of the matters asserted therein.  (See
Scott v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th
743, 752-54.)
 
DISCUSSION
Meet and Confer
            The
meet and confer requirement has been met. 
 
Legal Standard
A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law.  (Durell
v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)  The court accepts as true all material
factual allegations and affords them a liberal construction, but it does not
consider conclusions of fact or law, opinions, speculation, or allegations
contrary to law or judicially noticed facts. 
(Shea Homes Limited Partnership v.
County of Alameda (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1246, 1254.)  With respect to a demurrer, the complaint
must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from the facts
pleaded.  (Rodas v. Spiegel (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 513, 517.)  A demurrer will be sustained without leave to
amend if there exists no reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  
 
As it is unopposed, the Court SUSTAINS
the Demurrer with 20 days leave to amend. 
(Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)[1]
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
