And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the demurrer filed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (Moving Defendant) to the seventh cause of action for negligence in the plaintiff's first amended complaint (FAC). The Moving Defendant argues that the FAC fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The judge has granted the defendants' request for judicial notice of certain documents and their legal effect, but not to the truth of the matters asserted therein.

The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff will not be able to cure the defects in the FAC by amending it. The Moving Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling, and the parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court as directed by the instructions provided on the court website.
