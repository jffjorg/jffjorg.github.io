Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has denied Ford's motion to compel arbitration in this Song-Beverly Action case. The court found that Ford has not established the existence of a valid binding arbitration agreement between the plaintiffs and Ford. The court also rejected Ford's arguments that it can compel arbitration under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, as a third-party beneficiary, or under the delegation clause in the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC). The court held that the RISC does not apply to the dispute between the plaintiffs and Ford, and that Ford was not a party to the warranty contract between the plaintiffs and Ford. Therefore, Ford's motion to compel arbitration is denied.
