And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Defendant Stoneville USA, Inc.'s Custodian of Records and Person Most Knowledgeable. The plaintiff had requested the deposition to gather evidence regarding product identification of the artificial stone that the plaintiff cut during his employment. The judge has also reserved the issue of sanctions for argument at the hearing, as the plaintiff's counsel had requested $2,660.00 in sanctions due to the defendant's failure to appear for the deposition. The judge intends to order the date for the deposition at the hearing, and urges counsel to confer before the hearing to select a date, time, and location for the deposition and production of documents.
