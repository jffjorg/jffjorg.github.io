And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the petition to change name will be granted. However, the petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A signed copy of the decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date. The judge also notes that once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
