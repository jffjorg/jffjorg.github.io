And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Petitioner has failed to provide any form of identification tied to a fingerprint on file, which is necessary for Probation to run a criminal history assessment. The Petitioner must provide Probation with some form of identification verified by a fingerprint to enable Probation to run a criminal history assessment. The Petitioner may do this by providing a California driver license number or California ID number, providing a driver license number or DMV-issued ID number from another state, or contacting the Probation Officer for instructions on how to have fingerprints taken for a LIVESCAN and results sent to Probation. The petition is continued to October 30, 2023 at 9 am to enable the Petitioner to pursue one of these options. If the Petitioner fails to provide Probation with sufficient information prior to the next hearing date, the petition will be denied and dismissed without prejudice.
