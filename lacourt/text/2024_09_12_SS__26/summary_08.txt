Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Respondent Maria Chavez's Motion for Reconsideration and vacated the order granting Petitioner State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company's Motion to Compel Medical Examination and Award of Sanctions. The Motion to Compel IME was not properly served at the correct email address, and the Respondent was not notified of the hearing. The judge finds that the Respondent has presented sufficient evidence of new or different facts and circumstances to satisfy the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1008.

The judge has denied Respondent Maria Chavez's Motion for Sanctions. The Motion for Sanctions was filed too late, as it did not comply with the safe-harbor provision of Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7.
