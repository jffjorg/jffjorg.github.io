Discussion
 
Allegations in the Complaint
 
Plaintiff’s Assignor, State
Compensation Insurance Fund (“SCIF”) is a corporation and an insurance issuer
and underwriter, and the claims herein were assigned to Plaintiff for
collection only. (FAC, ¶4.) Defendant and SCIF entered into a written agreement
for SCIF to provide a policy of workers compensation insurance to Defendant,
bearing Policy No. 9254030-21 in exchange for Defendant’s payment of premiums.
(Id. at 11.) The Policy covered the period of May 15, 2021 through
February 22, 2022. (Ibid.) SCIF performed all its obligations under the
Policy. (Id. at ¶13.) Defendant breached its obligations by failing to
comply with audit requirements after the Policy terminated and by failing to
pay the estimated premium invoice requiring payment in the amount of $11,554.50.
(Id. at ¶14.) Despite demand by Plaintiff and/or SCIF, Defendant has
refused to pay the amount owing, which is also accruing interest at a rate of
ten percent per annum from the June 18, 2022 due date. (Id. at ¶¶3,
14-18.) 
 
Motion for Summary Adjudication
 
Plaintiff moves for summary adjudication of the first cause
of action for breach of contract pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
437c. On a motion for summary judgment or adjudication of a particular cause of
action, a moving plaintiff must show that there is no defense by proving each
element of the cause of action entitling the party to judgment on that cause of
action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Then the burden shifts to the
defendant to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as
to that cause of action or a defense. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).)
Additionally, in ruling on the Motion, the Court must view the “evidence
[citations] and such inferences [citations], in the light most favorable to the
opposing party.” (Intrieri v. Superior Court (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 72,
81 [citing Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826,
843].)
 
 
Plaintiff’s Initial Burden of Proof
 
An action for breach of
contract must demonstrate the following elements: (1) the existence of the
contract, (2) the plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the
defendant’s breach; and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff. (D’Arrigo
Bros. of California v. United Farmworkers of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th
790, 800.) Defendant moves for summary judgment on the grounds that there are
no disputed facts as to its lack of liability for breach of the vehicle lease
agreement.
 
In support of its Motion for Summary Adjudication for the
breach of contract action, Plaintiff presents the following undisputed facts. Defendant
submitted an application for worker’s compensation insurance coverage to SCIF
on May 13, 2019. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 1; Inniss Decl., ¶4 and
Exh. 4.) Based on the information in the application, SCIF issued to Defendant Policy No. 9254030-21 for 2019, and renewed
the Policy for 2020. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 2; Inniss Decl.,
¶5.) Each year, Defendant was given a copy of the terms and condition of the
Policy, which set forth the required audit to determine the final premiums owed
by Defendant. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 2; Inniss Decl., ¶5.)
Defendant renewed the Policy in 2021. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 3;
Inniss Decl., ¶5 and Exh. 2.) An insured is also obligated to submit voluntary
payroll reports during the course of a policy and SCIF may adjust the interim
premiums based on those reports. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 4;
Inniss Decl., ¶6.) 
 
Defendant failed to timely submit
the required payroll reports and its policy was cancelled on February 22, 2022;
it submitted untimely payroll reports on March 22, 2022. (Motion, Separate
Statement, Fact Nos. 5-6; Inniss Decl., ¶¶6-7 and Exhs. 3-5.) SCIF sent Defendant
letters on March 20, 2022 and April 15, 2022 advising that it still needed to
comply with the required audit pursuant to the policy terms. (Motion, Separate
Statement, Fact Nos. 7-8; Inniss Decl., ¶8 and Exhs. 6-7.) SCIF estimated the
earned premiums and used Defendant’s payroll reports to issue its Final
Estimated Statement in the amount of $11,554.50. (Motion, Separate Statement,
Fact No. 9; Inniss Decl., ¶9 and Exh. 8.) SCIF sent Defendant letters on July
11, 2022 and August 11, 2022 stating that the balance was still due and owing.
(Motion, Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 10-11; Inniss Decl., ¶10 and Exhs.
9-10.) The account was assigned to Plaintiff on August 26, 2022. (Motion,
Separate Statement, Fact No. 12; Inniss Decl., ¶11 and Exh. 12.) 
 
On August 29, 2022, and in October and November 2023,
Plaintiff sent Defendant letters regarding the need to provide information to
complete the audit. (Motion, Separate Statement,
Fact Nos. 13-14; Inniss Decl., ¶12 and Exh. 13; Brown Decl., ¶2 and Exh. 12.) In
the first letter, Defendant was warned that Plaintiff could seek treble damages
under Insurance Code section 11760.1, subdivision (a) if Defendant did not
contact SCIF to complete the requisite audit. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact
No. 13; Brown Decl., ¶2 and Exh. 12.) On November 30, 2023, Plaintiff sent
defense counsel a letter meeting the requirements of Insurance Code section
11760.1, subdivision (a). (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 15; Brown
Decl., ¶3 and Exh. 14.) Plaintiff has been damaged by Defendant’s breach in the
amount of $39,334.32 based on the invoive amount of $11,554.50, multiple by
three, plus interest at 10 percent per annum. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact
No. 16; Brown Decl., ¶4.) 
 
This evidence carries
Plaintiff’s initial burden of proof demonstrating the lack of any triable
issues of material fact regarding Defendant’s breach of the contract and
resulting damages to Plaintiff. The burden now shifts to Defendant to
demonstrate the existence of triable issues of material fact. 
 
Defendant’s Burden to
Demonstrate the Existence of a Triable Issue of Material Fact
 
Defendant’s opposition is not a
model of clarity. It is also in violation of critical procedural requirements
by failing to include a responsive separate statement. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (b)(3); Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1350(e)(2).) Primarily, Defendant argues that triable issues of material fact
exist and that Plaintiff’s evidence is problematic for lack of foundation and
authentication. Yet no specific portion of Plaintiff’s evidence is cited with
respect to these objections. This, too, violates mandatory procedural rules.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1354.) Nor does the opposition cite any evidence
of its own. Finally, the opposition includes numerous arguments that have no
bearing on Plaintiff’s Motion and appear to have been taken from an opposition
to some other motion. For example, Defendant argues that the Motion does not
refer to the separate statement, yet the Motion clearly does. Defendant also
argues that Plaintiff has not addressed its claims of declaratory relief and
cancellation of instrument, which are not claims in the First Amended
Complaint. No evidence is proffered for the Court’s consideration in the opposition,
let alone evidence that demonstrates the existence of a triable issue of
material fact.

Therefore, Plaintiff Creditors
Adjustment Bureau, Inc.’s Motion for Summary Adjudication is GRANTED WITH
RESPECT TO THE FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT.
