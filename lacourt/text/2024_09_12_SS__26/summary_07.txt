And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion of LA Auto Center, LLC (Defendant) to vacate the default entered on June 24, 2024. The default was entered because Defendant failed to file a responsive pleading to the complaint filed by Giovanni Gonzalez (Plaintiff) on April 4, 2024. Defendant filed the motion to vacate default on August 1, 2024, and no opposition was filed. The judge finds that the motion was timely filed and that Defendant's attorney affidavit of fault states that the defense counsel failed to calendar the date to file a response to the Complaint. Therefore, the judge grants the motion and vacates the default. Defendant LA Auto Center, LLC is ordered to file and serve its answer to the complaint within 20 days of this order.
