And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Santos v. Work & Vision, Inc., et al. The ruling sustains the demurrer filed by Cross-Defendant Photogenics Media, LLC to the First Amended Cross-Complaint without leave to amend. This means that the First Amended Cross-Complaint is dismissed, and Cross-Defendant must file and serve a proposed judgment of dismissal within 20 days. The judge's ruling is based on the argument that the First Amended Cross-Complaint is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Labor Commissioner, and that the Court lacks jurisdiction over the claims raised in the complaint.
