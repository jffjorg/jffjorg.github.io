ANALYSIS:
 
On April 4, 2024, Plaintiff Giovanni Gonzalez (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action for automobile subrogation against Defendant LA Auto
Center, LLC (“Defendant LA Auto”) and Jet Insurance Company (“Defendant Jet”).
Following Defendant LA Auto’s failure to file a responsive pleading, the Court
entered its default on June 26, 2024. 
 
Defendant LA Auto filed the instant Motion to Vacate Default
on August 1, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant LA Auto moves to vacate the entry of default
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), which states
that an application for relief must be made no more than six months after entry
of the order from which relief is sought and must be accompanied by an
affidavit of fault attesting to the mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect
of the moving party or its attorney. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); English
v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) When based on
attorney fault with respect to entry of default, default judgment, or
involuntary dismissal, a timely request for relief must be granted. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) The motion must also be accompanied by a copy of the
moving defendant’s proposed pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) This
can be corrected if Defendant submits a proposed responsive pleading by the
hearing date. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi
(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403.) 
 
The instant Motion was timely filed less than months after
entry of default on June 24, 2024. The Motion is also supported by an attorney
affidavit of fault stating that defense counsel failed to calendar the date to
file a response to the Complaint. (Motion, Galan Decl., ¶¶6-7.) A copy of
Defendant LA Auto’s proposed answer is also attached to the Motion. (Id.
at Exh. 1.) Therefore, relief from the entry of default must be granted. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant LA Auto Center, LLC’s Motion to Vacate Default is
GRANTED. THE DEFAULT ENTERED ON JUNE 24, 2024 IS HEREBY VACATED. DEFENDANT LA
AUTO CENTER, LLC IS TO FILE AND SERVE ITS ANSWER TO THE COMPLAINT WITHIN 20
DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
