[Tentative] Order Granting Petition for
Writ of Mandate
 

 
INTRODUCTION
            
            Petitioner
Michael Millman (“Petitioner”) owns two rental properties: (1) A five-unit
residential rental property located at 2462 Coolidge Avenue in Los Angeles,
California; and 
(2) A four-unit residential rental
property located at 2466 Coolidge Avenue in Los Angeles, California.  These properties are subject to the City’s
Rent Stabilization Ordinance (the “RSO”). 
Petitioner applied for a temporary, monthly rent increase under the RSO
for seismic retrofit work.  The Los
Angeles Housing Department, Rent Stabilization Division (the “Department”)
approved the increase for six units and denied the increase for three units.  Now, Petitioner seeks  a writ of administrative mandate directing
Respondent City of Los Angeles (“Respondent” or the “City”) to set aside that
decision.  The hearing officer applied
the regulations governing “primary renovation work” to Petitioner’s seismic retrofit
work without any explanation, i.e., there is no apparent legal basis to do so,
and the hearing officer did not make any factual finding that Petitioner’s seismic
retrofit work falls within the definition of “primary renovation work.”  Therefore, the court grants the writ and remands the case for reconsideration in light of this court’s opinion
and judgment, per Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5(f).  
 
BACKGROUND 
 
            In
2015 and 2016, the City adopted Ordinances 183893, 184080, and 184081 (the “Ordinances”)
to establish mandatory standards for earthquake hazard reduction in existing
wood-frame buildings with soft, weak, or open-front walls (hereafter “seismic retrofit
work”).  (AR 64-96.)  These Ordinances have been codified in the
Los Angeles Municipal Code (“LAMC”) and authorize the Rent Adjustment
Commission (“RAC”) to promulgate regulations to establish the health, safety,
and habitability standards which shall be followed during seismic retrofit work.  Such regulations shall include, among other
things, “provisions regarding advanced notification.”  (AR 91.) 
Pursuant to this authority, RAC promulgated regulations effective
January 23, 2017, governing seismic retrofit work.  (See RJN, Exh. 2.)  The City’s LAMC and regulations authorize the
Department to grant rental adjustments for rental units located in residential
buildings upon which mandatory seismic retrofit work is performed.  (AR 88; RJN, Exh. 1 at 5; RJN, Exh. 2 at
11.)  
 
            Petitioner
was notified that his properties fell under the Ordinances and required
mandatory Seismic Retrofit Work.  (See
e.g. AR 537.)  Petitioner prepared a Tenant
Habitability Plan (“THP”), which was accepted by the Department on or about
February 7, 2018.  (AR 132.)  The THP identified five tenants, their unit
numbers, their current rent, and the date of last rent increases.  (AR 134.) 
The administrative record also includes documents titled “Notice of
Seismic Retrofit Work” and that are addressed to the five tenants.  (AR 138-149.) 
Petitioner performed the mandatory seismic retrofit work, and the City
issued a certificate of compliance for such work on July 16, 2020.  (AR 179.)
 
On October 1, 2020, Petitioner
submitted an application for cost recovery for seismic retrofit work and
claimed a total cost of $39,479.65. 
Originally, the Department approved the application for five out of the nine
total units because only five units were included in the THP.  After further review of additional
documentation submitted, the Department revised its determination to conclude
that six out of nine units are eligible for a cost recovery surcharge.  The Department approved a total cost of
$39,479.65 for seismic retrofit work and a per unit monthly rent increase of
$21.16 for 120 months for six out of the nine units at the Property.  (See AR 437-438; see also AR 840-855.)
 
            Petitioner
appealed the Department’s determination regarding cost recovery to a General
Manager Hearing Officer (“GMHO”).  The
record contains two GHMO decisions.  In
the First GMHO Decision, hearing officer Brent Rosenbaum upheld the
Department’s determination to deny cost recovery on the grounds that the “Rent
Registry” for the Property had not been completed for the years 2019-2022.  (See AR 685-693.)  Petitioner subsequently corrected the rent
registration issue.  (See Oppo. 5:3-17;
see also AR 265-379 and 434.)  The First
GMHO Decision is not at issue in this writ proceeding.  
 
            After
correcting the rent registration issue, Petitioner filed a second hearing
request and an evidentiary hearing on his appeal was held before hearing
officer Angela Shaw (“Hearing Officer”) on May 30, 2023.  The hearing officer upheld the Department’s
determination to approve a total cost of $39,479.65 for seismic retrofit work
and a per unit monthly rent increase of $21.16 for 120 months for six out of the
nine units at the Property.  (AR 439.)  The hearing officer interpreted the
Ordinances and RAC regulations governing “Primary Renovation Work” to prohibit
the imposition of any rent increase, including for Seismic Retrofit Work, for
residential units for which the initial rent was established after the date the
THP for the Property was accepted by the Department.  (AR 437-439.) 
Because the initial rents for three units were established after the
date the THP was accepted, Petitioner was not entitled to a rental increase for
seismic retrofit costs for those three units. 
(Ibid.)   
 
EVIDENTIARY ISSUES
 
            1.         Respondent’s Request for Judicial
Notice 
 
Respondent requests judicial notice of the following
documents: (1) excerpts from City’s Rent Stabilization Ordinance (“RSO”), Los
Angeles Municipal Code (“LAMC”) § 151.07; (2) Department’s Rent Adjustment
Commission Regulations 720.00 to 720.03, effective January 23, 2017; (3) excerpts
from the City’s Rent Stabilization Ordinance, LAMC § 151.05; (4) LAMC § 91.9301,
Ordinance No. 183,893; and (5) Excerpts from the City’s tenant habitability
program, LAMC § 152.00 et. seq.  Petitioner
objects to the court doing so, having filed a motion in limine on this
issue.  
 
The court overrules Petitioner’s objections, denies
Petitioner’s motion in limine on this issue, and grants Respondent’s request
for judicial notice, per Evidence Code section 452(b) and (c).  The matters subject to judicial notice
constitute the statutory and regulatory laws of the City of Los Angeles.  As a landlord operating a residential
property within the City, Petitioner is on notice of the City’s laws and
regulations that apply to his property.  Indeed,
those parts of the request for judicial notice that constitute Ordinances
183893, 184080, and 184081 are part of the certified administrative record and
some parts of the Ordinances are included with Petitioner’s opening brief.  (See AR 64-96 and Opening Brief Exh. 1.)  For all of these reasons, Petitioner fails to
show that the matters for which judicial notice is requested were “hidden and
concealed” from him.
 
            2.         Petitioner’s Demand for Live Testimony
and Production of Documents 
 
            On
November 30, 2023, Petitioner filed and served a demand that Respondent produce
documents, as well as a witness, at the hearing on this petition for writ of
mandate.  Specifically, Petitioner seeks
to compel the testimony of Dolly Li, the Department’s representative at the administrative
hearing.  “As a general rule, a hearing on a
writ of administrative mandamus is conducted solely on the record of the
proceeding before the administrative agency.” 
(Richardson
v. City and County of San Francisco (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 671, 702.)  Petitioner has not complied with Code of
Civil Procedure section 1094.5(e) to present oral or documentary evidence at
the hearing.  Further, Petitioner has not filed a request to present oral testimony
pursuant to California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1306.  Putting that aside, Petitioner establishes no good cause to stray from the administrative
record in this case.
 
            3.         Petitioner’s Additional Evidence 
 
            Petitioner
submitted evidence with his opening brief and reply brief, specifically, his
declaration, the declaration of a tenant, and various other exhibits, some of which are not part of the certified administrative
record.  In order to consider evidence
outside the administrative record, Petitioner was required to file a noticed
motion to augment the record, which he failed to do.  Putting that aside, Petitioner does not satisfy
the standard for consideration of evidence outside the administrative record, because
he does not demonstrate that this evidence could not have been produced or was
improperly excluded at the administrative hearing.  (See Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5(e).)  
 
            4.         Petitioner’s Allegations of Discovery
Abuse
 
            The
remainder of Petitioner’s motion in limine seeks to exclude unspecified
evidence based upon purported discovery abuses by Respondent.  In this
case, the court relied exclusively on the administrative record, which included
many of the relevant regulations and the hearing officer’s decision.  Regardless, Petitioner never sought leave to
conduct discovery or sought to compel any discovery in advance of trial, and he
has not provided copies of the relevant discovery requests or responses.  Nor does his motion identify what he seeks to
exclude.  Accordingly, there is no basis
to find that Respondent engaged in a misuse of the discovery process that would
justify any sanction.  (See, e.g., Code
Civ. Proc. § 2023.030.)  
 
STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1094.5, the pertinent issues are whether the respondent
has proceeded without jurisdiction, whether there was a fair trial, and whether
there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion. 
An abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in
the manner required by law, the decision is not supported by the findings, or
the findings are not supported by the evidence. 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5(b).)[1]
 
An agency
is presumed to have regularly performed its official duties.  (Evid. Code § 664.)  “[A] trial court must afford a strong
presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings.”  (Fukuda
v. City of Angels (1999) 20 Cal. 4th 805, 817.)  Significantly, the petitioner
seeking administrative mandamus has the burden of proof and must cite to the
administrative record to support its contentions.  (See Alford v. Pierno (1972) 27
Cal.App.3d 682, 691.)  A
reviewing court “will not act as counsel for either party to an appeal and will
not assume the task of initiating and prosecuting a search of the record for
any purpose of discovering errors not pointed out in the briefs.” (Fox v. Erickson (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d
740, 742.)  When an appellant challenges “the
sufficiency of the evidence, all material evidence on the point must be set
forth and not merely [its] own evidence.” (Toigo v. Town of Ross (1998)
70 Cal.App.4th 309, 317.)  Substantial evidence is relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might
accept as adequate to support a conclusion (California
Youth Authority v. State Personnel Board (2002) 104 Cal. App. 4th 575,
584-85), or evidence of ponderable legal significance which is reasonable in
nature, credible and of solid value. (Mohilef
v. Janovici (1996) 51 Cal. App. 4th 267, 305 n. 28.)  Under the substantial evidence test,
“[c]ourts may reverse an [administrative] decision only if, based on the
evidence …, a reasonable person could not reach the conclusion reached by the
agency.”  (Sierra Club v. California Coastal Com. (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 602,
610.)    
 
However, the court conducts a de novo review with respect to
certain issues.  The court
exercises “independent judgment” in addressing questions of law.  (See Christensen
v. Lightbourne (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 1239, 1251.)  “Interpretation of a statute or regulation is
a question of law subject to independent review.”  (Ibid.; see also State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.
v. Quackenbush (1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 65, 77.)  
 
The rules governing statutory construction are well
settled. We begin with the fundamental premise
that the objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate
legislative intent.  To determine
legislative intent, we turn first to the words of the statute, giving them
their usual and ordinary meaning.  When
the language of a statute is clear, we need go no further. However, when the
language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation, we look to
a variety of extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved,
the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy,
contemporaneous administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which
the statute is a part.  
 
(Nolan v. City of Anaheim (2004)
33 Cal.4th 335, 340, citations omitted.) 
To the extent “purely legal issues involve the interpretation of a
statute an administrative agency is responsible for enforcing, [the court]
exercise[s] [its] independent judgment, ‘taking into account and respecting the
agency’s interpretation of its meaning.’” (Housing
Partners I, Inc. v. Duncan (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 1335, 1343; see also Yamaha Corp. of America v. State Bd. Of
Equalization (1998) 19 Cal.4th 1, 11.) 
Similarly, “[a] challenge to the procedural fairness of the
administrative hearing is reviewed de novo on appeal because the ultimate
determination of procedural fairness amounts to a question of law.”  (Nasha
L.L.C. v. City of Los Angeles (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 470, 482.)  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            There is no dispute that, per Los Angeles Municipal Code section 151.07(A)(1)(d),
a landlord undertaking seismic retrofit work is entitled to “a temporary
monthly rent surcharge” that shall be 50% of the cost amortized over 120
months.  Pursuant to section 151.07(A)(8),
the Rent Adjustment Commission implemented sections 721.00, et seq. of
the “Regulations and Guidelines.”  In
deciding Petitioner’s challenge, the hearing officer did rely on these
regulations.  Instead, the hearing
officer found as follows:
 
The issue under
consideration is the landlord’s eligibility for a Primary Renovation Work rent
increase based on the Commission’s Regulations. 
The Seismic Retrofit Program follows the Rent Adjustment Commission (RAC)
Regulations and Guidelines for Primary Renovation Cost Recovery.
 
(AR 436.)  The hearing officer
then relied on RAC 223.04, which is titled “Permanent Rent Increase” and states
as follows:
 
Any cost recovery
allowed under these regulations shall constitute a permanent monthly increase
in rent.  However, no rent increase
may be imposed on a unit where the initial rent was established after the date
the Tenant Habitability Plan applicable to a given rent adjustment application
was accepted by the Department.
 
(AR 437, emphasis in original.)  
 
            Petitioner argues that
the hearing officer prejudicially abused her discretion because section 151.07(A)(1)(d)
does not require a THP as a condition of receiving reimbursement.  Petitioner also argues that the hearing
officer erred in applying RAC 223.04 to seismic retrofit work because seismic
retrofit work is subject to a temporary rent increase, and RAC 223.04 relates
to permanent monthly increases.   
 
            Neither the hearing
officer nor Respondent’s counsel explains the legal or factual basis for the
hearing officer’s conclusion that RAC 223.04 applies to seismic retrofit work.  The court found no reference in RAC 720.00, et
seq. incorporating RAC 223.04 or authorizing the Department to rely on that
provision in assessing eligibility for reimbursement under Los Angeles
Municipal Code section 151.07(A)(1)(d).  The
hearing officer may have relied on a factual determination that RAC 220.00, et
seq. governs seismic retrofit work based upon the nature of the work.  These regulations apply to “primary renovation
work and related work.”  (See AR 437,
citing RAC 222.00.)  However, there is no
explanation in the hearing officer’s decision why Petitioner’s seismic retrofit
work would fall within the scope of RAC 220.00, et seq.  Nor has the City requested that the court
take judicial notice of RAC 220.00, et seq., which prevents the court
from reviewing the evidence in the administrative record to see whether it
falls within the appropriate definition of “primary renovation work.”  Regardless, even if an argument could be made
that Petitioner’s seismic retrofit work constituted “primary renovation work
and related work,” it is not the court’s function to search the administrative
record and determine whether substantial evidence could support administrative
findings that were never made. 
 
            Based upon the
foregoing, the court finds that the hearing officer erred.  A writ of administrative mandamus will not be
issued unless the court is persuaded that an abuse of discretion was
prejudicial.  (See Thornbrough v.
Western Placer Unified School Dist. (2013) 223 Cal.App.4th 169, 200.)  However, in analyzing the issue of prejudice,
the court must also consider the adequacy of the administrative findings.  In Topanga
Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles, (1974) 11 Cal. 3d
506, 515, the Supreme Court held that “implicit in [Code of Civil Procedure]
section 1094.5 is a requirement that the agency which renders the challenged
decision must set forth findings to bridge the analytic gap between the raw
evidence and ultimate decision or order.” 
This is critical.    
 
[A]mong other functions, … findings enable the
reviewing court to trace and examine the agency’s mode of analysis.…  Absent such roadsigns, a reviewing court
would be forced into unguided and resource-consuming explorations; it would
have to grope through the record to determine whether some combination of credible
evidentiary items which supported some line of factual and legal conclusions
supported the ultimate order or decision of the agency….  
 
(Id. at
516-517, citations and footnotes omitted; see also West Chandler Blvd.
Neighborhood Ass’n vs. City of Los Angeles (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1506,
1521-22.)  Although administrative
findings are entitled to considerable latitude, “mere conclusory findings without reference to the record are
inadequate.”  (West Chandler
Blvd. Neighborhood Ass’n, supra, 198 Cal.App.4th at 1521-22.)
 
            In the instant case, the hearing
officer’s administrative findings were based predominately on the RAC regulations governing primary renovation work.  The Decision cites no legal basis for
applying these regulations to seismic retrofit work, and the court’s review of
the regulations identified none.  To the
extent the hearing officer relied on a determination that Petitioner’s work falls
within the scope of “primary renovation work,” there is no factual finding on
this issue.  Respondent’s counsel does
not address this issue sufficiently to defeat the petition.  Because the matter must be remanded for
further proceedings, the court does not reach the parties’ remaining
contentions at this time.  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            Based
upon the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
            1.         The petition for writ of administrative
mandate is granted.  
 
            2.         Petitioner’s motion in limine is
denied.  
 
            3.         The court finds that the hearing
officer erred when she defined the issue as “the landlord’s eligibility
for a Primary Renovation Work rent increase” and applied RAC Regulations
223.01, et seq. to Petitioner’s appeal. 

 
4.         Similarly,
the court finds that the hearing officer did not provide a sufficient legal or
factual basis for her conclusion that “[t]he Seismic Retrofit Program follows
the Rent Adjustment Commission (RAC) Regulations and Guidelines for Primary
Renovation Cost Recovery.”    
 
            5.         The court finds that the hearing
officer made insufficient findings pursuant to Topanga
Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles, (1974) 11 Cal. 3d
506 for denying the cost recovery as to the three
rental units at issue.  
 
            6.         The court remands the case for
reconsideration in light of this court’s opinion and judgment, per Code of
Civil Procedure section 1094.5(f).  
 
            7.         Respondent’s counsel shall prepare and
lodge a judgment. 
 
            8.         The court’s clerk shall provide
notice.  
 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
