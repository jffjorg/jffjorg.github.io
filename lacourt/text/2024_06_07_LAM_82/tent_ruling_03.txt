[Tentative] Order Sustaining
Demurrer and Dismissing Case with Prejudice
 
            Petitioner
Angie Kiroloss (“Petitioner”) filed this action against the Torrance Housing
Assistance Community Development Department (“Respondent”) and the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”).  In the second amended petition, Petitioner
challenges the decision on June 5, 2023, to terminate her housing benefits.  Now, Respondent demurs to the second amended
petition, arguing: (1) The petition is untimely; (2) The petition is moot; and
(3) The petition is uncertain.  
 
 A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer
must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.
(Code Civil Proc. § 430.30, subd. (a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.) “We assume the truth of the allegations in the complaint, but do not
assume the truth of contentions, deductions, or conclusions of law.” 
(California Logistics, Inc. v. State (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 242, 247.)  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and
not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.” 
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  The allegations in the petition must be
liberally construed in favor of Petitioner on demurrer.  (See Mobil Oil Corp. v Exxon Corp.
(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 942, 947.)  “A demurrer
must dispose of an entire cause of action to be sustained.”  (Poizner
v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.)
 
Respondent
contends that Petitioner’s petition for writ of administrative mandate is time
barred by the 90-day statute of limitations in Code of Civil Procedure section
1094.6.  Although the decision is dated
June 5, 2024, the statute of limitations starts to run on the date the decision
is mailed.  (Code Civ. Proc. §
1094.6(b).)  Respondent asks this court
to take judicial notice of Petitioner’s “answer” to the demurrer (which the
court construes as an “opposition” to the demurrer).  The court grants that request for judicial
notice.  Petitioner included a copy of
the envelope which contained the final decision, and Petitioner states under
penalty of perjury that the postmark was Tuesday, June 6, 2023.  Accordingly, Petitioner was required to file
this petition on or before Monday, September 4, 2023.  Petitioner filed this action on Wednesday
September 6, 2023, meaning that this action is untimely.   
 
Based
upon the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
1.         The court sustains Respondent’s
demurrer.
 
2.         The court denies leave to amend, as no
amendment would remedy this defect.
 
3.         The court dismisses this petition with
prejudice.  
 
4.         Respondent’s counsel shall lodge a
proposed judgment.
 
5.         Respondent’s counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of service with the court.
