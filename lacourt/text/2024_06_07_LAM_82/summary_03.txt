And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by the Respondent, dismissing the petition with prejudice. The court finds that the petition is untimely, as the decision to terminate housing benefits was made on June 5, 2023, and the petition was filed on September 6, 2023. The court notes that the statute of limitations starts to run on the date the decision is mailed, and since the decision was mailed on June 6, 2023, the petition was required to be filed on or before September 4, 2023. As the petition was filed late, the court dismisses the petition with prejudice.
