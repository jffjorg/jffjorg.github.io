Here is the summary in English:

The court's tentative ruling is a summary of the case's history and the issues at stake. The case involves a dispute over the control of the Beith David Education Center, a non-profit religious corporation. The Plaintiffs, Rafael Raz, et al., seek to void the election of the directors of the Center. The Defendants, Beith David Education Center, et al., seek to return control of the temple to Rabbi Darzan Levihim.

The court previously denied the Plaintiffs' ex parte application for a temporary restraining order and granted the Defendants' ex parte application for a temporary restraining order and order to show cause why a preliminary injunction shall not issue. The court issued a temporary restraining order and an order to show cause.

The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants have misappropriated funds and failed to return control of the temple. The Defendants deny these allegations and argue that they have returned control of the temple to Rabbi Levihim.

The court finds that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the Defendants have violated the temporary restraining order. The court also finds that the Plaintiffs have not demonstrated irreparable harm that necessitates immediate action by the court.

The court orders the Defendants to return the funds allegedly misappropriated by Rafael Raz and Shlomo Sherf. The court also orders Shlomo Sherf to return the funds allegedly held on behalf of Beith David. The court denied the Plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction.

The court holds that the Plaintiffs cannot intervene in religious matters relating to the management and operation of a religious institution. The court also holds that it cannot restrain a cross-defendant from engaging in activities on his own behalf.
