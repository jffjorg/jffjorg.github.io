administrative decision at issue does not affect a fundamental vested
right.  (See Northern Inyo Hosp. v.
Fair Emp. Practice Com. (1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 14, 23 [“[T]here is no vested
right to conduct a business free of reasonable governmental rules and
regulations”].)  Accordingly, the court
applies the substantial evidence test to the administrative findings.
