And here is a brief summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a special motion to strike the Cross-Complaint filed by the Defendants. The motion was filed by the Plaintiffs, who are seeking to strike the Cross-Complaint's claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) and negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED). The Judge has granted the motion, finding that the Plaintiffs' conduct was privileged and that the Defendants have failed to show a probability of prevailing on their claims. The Judge has also declined to strike the Cross-Complaint's request for punitive damages. The case will be heard on February 8, 2024, at which time the Judge will issue a final ruling.
