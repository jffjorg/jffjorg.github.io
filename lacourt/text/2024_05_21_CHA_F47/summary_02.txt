And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the demurrer filed by the defendants, Noureen Entertainment, Inc. and Zia Abhari, to the complaint filed by Centennial VTC LLC. The demurrer argues that the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain. The court has found that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged the legal effect of the contracts and has sufficiently alleged facts to satisfy each of the elements of a breach of contract claim. The court has also found that the defendants have failed to establish that the complaint is so uncertain that they cannot respond. Therefore, the demurrer is overruled and the answer is due within 30 days.
