SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of an automobile accident that
occurred on 7/23/21.  Plaintiffs Sara
Valenzuela, Cesar Valenzuela and Petra Pelayo claim that Defendant Giovanni
Licea (Defendant) caused the accident.  Additionally,
Plaintiffs claim to have suffered injuries as a result of the accident.  Therefore, on 5/4/23, Plaintiffs filed this
action against for negligence and motor vehicle.    
 
In July of 2023, Defendant noticed the depositions of Plaintiff
Cesar Valenzuela aka Cesar Amezcua (Cesar) for 11/7/23 and Plaintiff Petra
Pelayo (Pelayo) (collectively, Plaintiffs) for 11/8/23.  (See McNulty Decls., Ex.A).  Plaintiffs objected to the November dates on
the grounds that they were unavailable; however, despite repeated requests,
neither Plaintiff confirmed alternative deposition dates and neither appeared
for their depositions on the noticed dates in November.  (McNulty Decls., Ex.C-F). 
 
Thereafter, Defendant re-noticed Cesar and Pelayo’s depositions
for 2/7/24 and 2/8/24, respectively; however, due to a family emergency,
Defendant’s counsel rescheduled the depositions for 3/19/24 and 3/22/24.  (McNulty Decls., Ex.H-M).  Thereafter, Plaintiffs’ counsel objected to
the depositions being conducted in person at defense counsel’s office as
noticed.  (McNulty Decls., Ex.N).  Counsel for the parties could not agree on
the location/mode of deposition. 
(McNulty Decl., Ex.O; A. Zeesman Decls.).  Therefore, on 4/5/24, Defendant filed and
served the instant motions seeking: 
 
(1) An order compelling Plaintiff Cesar Valenzuela aka
Cesar Amezcua to attend and testify at deposition on 6/4/24 at 9:30 a.m. at the
offices of Mark R. Weiner & Associates located at 655 N. Central Avenue,
Suite 1125, Glendale, California 91203-1434. 
Additionally, Defendant Giovanni Licea requests an order imposing
sanctions against Plaintiff Cesar Valenzuela aka Cesar Amezcua and his
attorney, Alexander J. Zeesman, in the amount of $2,509.02; and 
 
(2) An order compelling Plaintiff Petra Pelayo to attend
and testify at deposition on 6/10/24 at 9:30 a.m. at the offices of Mark R.
Weiner & Associates located at 655 N. Central Avenue, Suite 1125, Glendale,
California 91203-1434.  Additionally,
Defendant Giovanni Licea requests an order imposing sanctions against Plaintiff
Petra Pelayo and her attorney, Alexander J. Zeesman, in the amount of
$2,497.02.
 
Cesar and Pelayo have opposed the motions and Defendant
has filed a joint reply to the oppositions. 

 
ANALYSIS
 
There is no dispute that Defendant is entitled to take
the depositions of Plaintiffs.  The
dispute involves whether Defendant is entitled to take the depositions in
person at his counsel’s office as noticed or whether Plaintiffs can insist that
the depositions be conducted remotely.
 
The deposing party may notice a deposition within 75
miles of the deponent’s residence or within the county where the action is
pending and within 150 miles of the deponent’s residence.  CCP 2025.220(a)(1); CCP 2025.250(a).  Plaintiffs do not claim that the location of
the noticed depositions, defense counsel’s office, does not fall within the
parameters of CCP 2025.250(a).
 
As conceded in the oppositions, while CCP 2025.310(a) allows
a deponent to require that the deposition officer be in a different location
than the deponent during the deposition, it does not allow the deponent to
elect to appear remotely for the deposition or choose the physical location of
the deposition.  As noted in CCP 2025.310(d),
“[a]n exercise of the authority granted by subdivision (a) or (b) does not
waive any other provision of this title, including, but not limited to,
provisions regarding the time, place, or manner in which a deposition shall be
conducted.”  CCP 2025.310(b) provides: 
 
“Subject to Section
2025.420 [re protective orders], any party or attorney of record may, but
is not required to, be physically present at the deposition at the location of
the deponent. If a party or attorney of record
elects to be physically present at the location of the deponent, all physically
present participants in the deposition shall comply with local health and
safety ordinances, rules, and orders.”
 
As such, Plaintiffs have failed to support their claim
that they are “entitled to remote deposition.” 
(See Oppositions, p.3:11).
 
Similarly, Plaintiffs have failed to establish that they
are entitled to protective orders requiring that the depositions be conducted
remotely.  (See Oppositions, p.5:6).  
 
CCP 2025.420(a) provides, 
in part, that “[b]efore, during, or after a deposition, any party, any
deponent, or any other affected or natural person or organization may promptly
move for a protective order.”   Here, Plaintiffs
never moved for a protective order. 
Rather, they objected to the taking the depositions scheduled in March
2024 on the invalid ground that they are entitled to appear remotely and improperly
request a protective order in their oppositions to the instant motions to
compel depositions.  (McNulty Decls., Ex.N).  Plaintiffs did not even raise the issue of
taking the depositions remotely until approximately 4 months after the
depositions were originally noticed.  (See
McNulty Decl. ¶¶3, 17, Ex.A, K).  As such,
Plaintiffs failed to meet the statutory requirement of promptly moving for a
protective order.
 
Even if Plaintiffs had promptly sought such relief, they
have not shown that such relief is warranted in order to protect them from unwarranted
annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense as is
required for the issuance of a protective order.  See CCP 2025.420(b).  Plaintiffs have failed to support their
claims that their injuries or lack of transportation make in person depositions
impractical with any admissible evidence. 
Additionally, such claims are belied by the email communications between
counsel wherein Plaintiffs’ counsel complains about the parking and other
amenities at defense counsel’s office as the reasons why the depositions should
be conducted remotely.  Further, in the
email communications, Plaintiffs’ counsel were fine with having their clients
travel to their office for the depositions which indicates that it is the
convenience of Plaintiffs’ counsel which is behind  the refusal to appear in person at defense
counsel’s office for the depositions as noticed.      
 
Under the current law, Defendant is entitled to choose
the location of the Plaintiffs’ deposition, within certain parameters which
have been followed in this case, unless Plaintiffs promptly move for a
protective order and show good cause for such relief, which as set forth above,
they have failed to do.   As such,
Defendant is entitled to orders compelling Plaintiffs to appear for their
depositions as requested.  CCP 2025.450(a),
(b).  
 
Defendant is entitled to sanctions against Plaintiffs and
their attorney, Alexander Zeesman, for their failure to comply with their
discovery obligations without good cause. 
CCP 2023.010(e), (f); CCP 2023.030(a); CCP 2025.450(g)(1).  
 
The Court finds that reduced sanctions in the amount of the
$2,028.52 in relation to the motion to compel
Cesar’s deposition and reduced sanctions in the amount of $2,016.52 in relation to the motion to compel Pelayo’s
deposition are reasonable.  (See
McNulty Decls. ¶29).  The Court has
reduced the amount of sanctions requested for the preparation of each motion,
review of the opposition to each motion, preparation of a reply and time to
appear by half for each motion since each motion and opposition thereto were
essentially the same, one joint reply has been filed and the hearing on each
motion is on the same date.  
CONCLUSION
 
The motions are granted. 

 
Plaintiff  Cesar
Valenzuela aka Cesar Amezcua is ordered to attend and testify at deposition on
6/4/24 at 9:30 a.m. at the offices of Mark R. Weiner & Associates located
at 655 N. Central Avenue, Suite 1125, Glendale, California 91203-1434.  Additionally, sanctions are imposed against
Plaintiff Cesar Valenzuela aka Cesar Amezcua and his attorney, Alexander J.
Zeesman, in the amount of $2,028.52, payable within 30 days.   
 
Plaintiff Petra Pelayo is ordered to attend and testify
at deposition on 6/10/24 at 9:30 a.m. at the offices of Mark R. Weiner &
Associates located at 655 N. Central Avenue, Suite 1125, Glendale, California
91203-1434.  Additionally, sanctions are
imposed against Plaintiff Petra Pelayo and her attorney, Alexander J. Zeesman,
in the amount of $$2,016.52, payable within 30 days.  
 
The Court notes that Plaintiffs’ counsel has failed to
electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to the oppositions as
required.  CRC 3.1110(f)(4).  Counsel for the parties in warned that
failure to comply with this rule in the future may result in matters being
continued so that papers can be re-filed in compliance with the rule, papers
not being considered and/or the imposition of sanctions.
