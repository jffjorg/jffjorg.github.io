Zia Abhari

NOTICE: ok

            1.  Breach of Lease
            2.  Breach of Guaranty
 
RULING: The demurrer is overruled.  Answer is due within 30 days.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Defendant Noureen
Entertainment, Inc.’s (Noureen) alleged breach of a written lease entered into
with Plaintiff Centennial VTC LLC’s (Plaintiff) predecessor-in-interest for
property located at 24201 W. Valencia Blvd., Suite 101 in Valencia,
California.  (Complaint ¶¶1, 4-6).
 
On 3/7/24, Plaintiff filed this action against Noureen
for breach of lease and against Defendant Zia Abhari (Abhari) for breach of written
guaranty of the lease.  Plaintiff has not
attached a copy of the lease or guaranty to the complaint.  After meet and confer efforts failed to
resolve the issues Defendants had with the complaint, on 4/5/24, Defendants
filed and served the instant demurrer to the entire complaint on the grounds
that it fails to allege sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action and is
uncertain.  CCP 430.10(e), (f).  Plaintiff has opposed the demurrer.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
The breach of lease and breach of guaranty causes of
action are both claims for breach of contract. 

 
The elements of a breach of contract cause of action are:
(1) a contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
defendant’s breach, and (4) resulting damages to plaintiff.  San Mateo Union High School District
(2013) 213 CA4th 418, 439;  Darbun
Enterprises, Inc. (2015) 239 CA4th 399, 409; Stockton Mortgage, Inc.
(2014) 233 CA4th 437, 447.
 
Defendants concede that the failure to attach a contract
to a complaint based thereon is not fatal to the complaint.  See Demurrer, p.3:26-p.4:2, p.4:17-21).  Contrary to Defendants’ assertion, the Court
finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged the legal effect of each of the
contracts as permitted by law.  See
Construction Protective Services, Inc. (2002) 29 C4th 189, 194, 198.  Additionally, Plaintiff has sufficiently
alleged facts to satisfy each of the elements of a breach of contract
claim.  (See Complaint ¶¶1, 4-8,
10-15).  Defendants have also failed to
establish that the complaint is so uncertain that they cannot respond.         
 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer is overruled.  Answer is due within 30 days.
