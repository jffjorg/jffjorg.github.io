Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge granted the defendant's motions to compel the depositions of the two plaintiffs, Cesar Valenzuela and Petra Pelayo. The plaintiffs had objected to the depositions being conducted in person at the defendant's counsel's office, claiming that they were entitled to appear remotely. However, the judge found that the defendant was entitled to choose the location of the depositions, and that the plaintiffs failed to establish any good cause for a protective order or a remote deposition. The judge also imposed sanctions on the plaintiffs and their attorney for their failure to comply with their discovery obligations.
