 Case Number:  21STCV31921    Hearing Date:   October 12, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE 
 
The Court GRANTS the motion of Defendant
Aremy L. Villatoro Lopez to compel Plaintiff to respond to Request for
Production of Documents (Set One). 
 
The Court GRANTS the request for
monetary sanctions in part. 
 
Background 
 
On August 27, 2021, Plaintiff Sharon R. Carter
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Aremy L. Villatoro-Lopez, Damaris
Lopez-Tul, Does 1 to 100 alleging causes of action for motor vehicle and
general negligence.  The complaint arises
from an alleged automobile collision which occurred on October 26, 2019. 
 
On September 15, 2023, Defendant Aremy L. Villatoro-Lopez
(“Defendant”) filed and served this motion seeking orders to compel Plaintiff
to respond to Request for Production of Documents (Set One). Defendant also
seeks monetary sanctions. 
 
Two other discovery motions in this matter were on calendar
for hearing on October 11.
 
Legal
Standard 
 
A party must respond to requests for production of documents
within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a
party to whom requests for production of documents are directed does not
provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order compelling
response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts
are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)
Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to requests for
production, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil
Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d),
defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond
to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
Discussion              
 
Plaintiff was
served with Defendant’s Request for Production of Documents (Set One) on
February 17, 2023.  (Mackey Decls., ¶ 2
and Exhs. A.)  Plaintiff never served
responses.  (Id., ¶¶ 3-6.)
 
Defendant need
not show anything more.  Defendant’s
motion to compel is granted.
 
Defendant’s
request for sanctions is granted in part. 
Given the relatively straightforward nature of a motion to compel
initial responses, and the economies of scale associated with preparing
multiple discovery motions in the same case, the Court awards monetary
sanctions in the amount of $310, calculated as 2 hours per motion, multiplied
by counsel’s billing rate of $125.00 per hour, plus a $60.00 filing fee.  (See id., ¶ 7.)  
 
Conclusion 
 
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s
motion to compel. 
 
Plaintiff is ORDERED to serve
complete, verified, and code-complaint responses, without objection, to Defendant’s
Request for Production of Documents (Set One) within 30 days of notice of this
order. 
 
Defendant’s request for monetary
sanctions is GRANTED in part.  Plaintiff
is ORDERED to pay monetary sanctions to Defendant in the total amount of $310
within 30 days of notice of this order. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
