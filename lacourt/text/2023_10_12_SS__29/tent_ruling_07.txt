 Case Number:  22STCV15268    Hearing Date:   October 12, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE
 
The motion is denied without prejudice.
 
Defendant’s
counsel Alexandra Barreno filed a motion to be relieved as counsel on May 17, 2023.

 
At
the hearing on June 6, 2023, the Court determined that counsel had not complied
with all of the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, identified
the specific missing items, and continued the hearing to August 9 to give
counsel the opportunity to address the issues specifically identified by the
Court in its order.
 
At
the hearing on August 9, 2023, the Court determined that again counsel had not
complied with all of the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, again identified the specific missing items, and again continued the
hearing, this time to October 12.
 
On
October 6, 2023, counsel filed a revised declaration and proposed order and
served them by mail on the client. This is not timely filing or service for a
hearing on October 12, 2023.
 
At
this time, the Court will not continue the hearing again. Counsel has already
been given several opportunities to address the specifically identified issues
in her motion.
 
The
Court denies the motion without prejudice. Counsel may file a new motion in
full compliance with all legal requirements, including those set forth in Rule 3.1362
and all applicable service rules.
