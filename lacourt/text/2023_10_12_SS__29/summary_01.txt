And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to continue the trial, which was scheduled for December 15, 2023. The defendant had requested a continuance to July 19, 2024, or an order setting a hearing on its motion for summary judgment earlier than the trial date. The judge finds that good cause exists for the continuance, citing the defendant's timely filing of its motion for summary judgment, the parties' stipulation to the continuance, and the significant unanticipated change in the status of the case caused by the newly added defendants not yet appearing in the case. The judge also notes that the parties are engaged in meaningful settlement discussions and that the length of the continuance requested is reasonable. The trial is continued to a date on or after July 19, 2024, and all deadlines are reset based on the new trial date.
