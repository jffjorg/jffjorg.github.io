 Case Number:  23STCV01475    Hearing Date:   October 12, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE
 
Defendant Luis Giovanni Gordiano’s demurrer is OVERRULED in
part and SUSTAINED in part without leave to amend. 
 
Background
 
This case arises out of an alleged vehicle
accident on January 19, 2021, near the intersection of South Fetterly Avenue and
East Olympic Avenue in Los Angeles, California.
 
On January 23, 2023, two years and four
days after the accident, Plaintiff Juan Romero Rosales (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Defendant Luis Giovanni Gordiano (“Defendant”), and Does 1
through 25, asserting causes of action for (1) negligence and (2) negligence
per se. 
 
On June 22, 2023, the Court sustained Defendant’s
demurrer based on the applicable two- year statute of limitations, with leave
to amend.  
 
Later that same day, on June 22, Plaintiff
filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”). In the FAC, Plaintiff asserts the same
causes of action against the same defendants. With regard to the statute of
limitations issue, Plaintiff alleges:
 
Plaintiff is informed and believes, and
thereupon alleges, that Defendant Giordiano was outside the State of California
in February 2021 for a period of ten (10) days, following the subject motor
vehicle accident in January of 2021, vacationing and/or honeymooning in Paris,
France. Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure § 351, Plaintiff’s
statute of limitations is therefore tolled for a period of ten additional days.
 
FAC, ¶ 4.
 
On September 11, 2023, Defendant filed this
demurrer to the FAC. Plaintiff filed an opposition on September 29, and on
October 5 Defendant filed a reply.
 
Legal
Standard
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of
action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor
v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th
1216, 1228.) In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face
of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone
and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where
the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF
Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue
involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.” (Hahn,
supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p. 747.
 
Preliminary Matters 
 
First,
with regard to the statutory meet-and-confer requirement of Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, on August
23, 2023, Defendant’s counsel emailed Plaintiff’s counsel and stated that Defendant
planned to demur to the FAC based on insufficient facts to prove that the
statute was tolled; Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond. (Desalernos Decl., ¶ 7.) As a result, the parties
did not comply with the mandatory requirement to meet and confer.  Although the Court may continue a hearing on a demurrer
when there has been a failure to comply with the mandatory meet-and-confer
provision of the statute, in these circumstances, given that the issues and
positions of the parties have become fairly well crystalized through the
demurrer and amendment process that has already occurred, the Court will
exercise its discretion to proceed to the merits. 
 
Second,
Defendant states in passing that he was not served with the FAC. But he has
filed a demurrer and argued (exclusively) other grounds for relief. Under these
circumstances, the Court will address the merits and treat the service issue as
waived.
 
Third,
Defendant does not comply with the procedural requirements for a demurrer: he
files a notice of demurrer, a supporting memorandum, and even a supporting
declaration, but no demurrer itself. Nonetheless, Plaintiff does not object to
this procedural failure, whether on grounds of lack of notice of otherwise, and
so the Court will address the merits.
 
Discussion
              
Statute of Limitations 
 
Defendants
demur to the entire FAC on the ground that it is barred by the two-year statute
of limitations in Code of Civil Procedure section 335.1. (Mem., pp. 4-5.)  Defendant argues
that the accident occurred on January 19, 2021, but the complaint was not filed
until more than two years later, on January 23, 2023. 
 
Defendant also
asserts that Plaintiff does not provide supporting evidence that Defendant was
in Paris for ten days and Defendant was not in Paris on the date of the service
of the summons and complaint. 
 
In paragraph 4 of
the FAC, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant was absent from the State of
California for ten days in February 2021, after the cause of action accrued,
and therefore the statute of limitations was tolled for that period under Code
of Civil Procedure section 351. Defendant argues that the FAC “does nothing to
substantiate this claim.” (Mem. at p. 4.) In his reply papers, Defendant also
submits a declaration from his attorney attesting that the international travel
of Defendant that Plaintiff may be referencing occurred in August 2019, before
the cause of action accrued. (Desalernos Reply Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
The Court
OVERRULES the Demurrer on statute of limitations grounds. Plaintiff has adequately
alleged in his FAC a factual basis for tolling. The Court will not consider
evidence outside of the four corners of the FAC (and judicially noticeable
facts) in ruling on a demurrer. Evidence regarding when Defendant did or did
not travel may be submitted at a later stage of these proceedings (such as a
motion for summary judgment or trial).
 
Second
Cause of Action for Negligence Per Se 
 
In the FAC, Plaintiff asserts a cause of action for negligence and a
second cause of action for negligence per se. Defendant demurs on the ground
that negligence per se is not a separate cause of action but falls under the
umbrella of a negligence cause of action and simply provides an alternate
method of proving the elements of negligence.
 
“The essential elements of a cause of action for negligence are: (1) the defendant's
legal duty of care toward the plaintiff; (2) the defendant's breach of duty—the
negligent act or omission; (3)¿injury to the plaintiff as a result of the
breach—proximate or legal cause; and (4) damage to the plaintiff.” (Leyva v.
Garcia (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 1095, 1103.) Owing a duty of care to the
plaintiff is an indispensable prerequisite to the imposition of liability for
negligence. (Richards v. Stanley (1954) 43 Cal.2d 60, 63.) A duty is an
“obligation, recognized by the law, requiring the actor to conform to certain
standard of conduct, for the protection of others against unreasonable risks.”
(Hilyar v. Union Ice Co. (1955) 45 Cal. 2d 30, 36-37.) 
 
“[T]he doctrine of negligence per
se is not a separate cause of action.” (Turner v. Seterus, Inc. (2018) 27
Cal.App.5th 516, 534; accord Millard v. Biosources, Inc. (2007)
156 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1353, fn.2; Quiroz v. Seventh Ave. Center (2006)
140¿Cal.App.4th 1256, 1285.) Rather, the doctrine “creates an evidentiary
presumption that affects the standard of care in a cause of action for negligence.”
(Turner, supra, 27 Cal.App.5th at p. 534.) It “codifies the rule that a
presumption of negligence arises from the violation of a statute which was
enacted to protect a class of persons of which the plaintiff is a member
against the type of harm that the plaintiff suffered as a result of the
violation. (Quiroz, supra, 140¿Cal.App.4th at p. 1285.) 
 
Accordingly, the Demurrer to Second Cause of Action is SUSTAINED. As
Plaintiff has offered no basis for the Court to conclude that the defect in
this cause of action may be cured, the Demurrer to the Second Cause of Action is
sustained WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
Conclusion
 
The Demurrer
to the entire First Amended Complaint is OVERRULED.
 
The Demurrer
to the Second Cause of Action (for negligence per se) is SUSTAINED WITHOUT
LEAVE TO AMEND. 
 
Defendant is
ordered to respond to the FAC within 21 days.
 
Defendant is ordered to give notice.
