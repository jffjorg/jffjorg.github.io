And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court grants Maplebear's motion to continue trial, which is set for May 6, 2024. The Court finds that good cause exists for the continuance, specifically the need to complete the deposition of Defendant Huang, who has serious health issues that have prevented his deposition. The Court notes that Defendant Huang appeared in the case recently and that Plaintiffs have had difficulty scheduling his deposition. The Court also considers the need to complete discovery and prepare for trial, as well as the potential for mediation. The Court resets the trial date and all deadlines based on the new trial date.
