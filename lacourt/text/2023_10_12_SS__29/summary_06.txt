And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion of defendant Aremy L. Villatoro Lopez to compel plaintiff Sharon R. Carter to respond to the request for production of documents (Set One). The court has also granted the request for monetary sanctions in part, awarding $310 to the defendant. The plaintiff failed to serve responses to the request for production of documents, despite being served on February 17, 2023. The court finds that the defendant's motion is straightforward and that the plaintiff's failure to respond is a misuse of the discovery process. The court orders the plaintiff to serve complete, verified, and code-complaint responses to the request for production of documents within 30 days, and to pay the awarded monetary sanctions to the defendant within 30 days.
