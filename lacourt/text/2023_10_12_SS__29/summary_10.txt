English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a civil case. The case involves a vehicle accident that occurred on January 19, 2021, and a subsequent complaint filed by the plaintiff, Juan Romero Rosales, on January 23, 2023. The defendant, Luis Giovanni Gordiano, filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that it was barred by the two-year statute of limitations. The plaintiff alleged that the statute of limitations was tolled for 10 days because the defendant was absent from the state of California during that time, but the defendant disputes this claim.

The court overrules the demurrer on the ground that the plaintiff has adequately alleged a factual basis for tolling the statute of limitations. However, the court sustains the demurrer to the second cause of action, which is for negligence per se, because the doctrine of negligence per se is not a separate cause of action and is merely an evidentiary presumption that affects the standard of care in a cause of action for negligence. The defendant is ordered to respond to the amended complaint within 21 days.
