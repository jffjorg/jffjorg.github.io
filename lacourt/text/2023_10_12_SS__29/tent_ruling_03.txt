 Case Number:  21STCV00661    Hearing Date:   October 12, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE:
 
The Court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant
and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference
call. 
 
The Court
has reviewed the Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action of a Minor
(Bradley Ramirez, Age 16). The court is prepared to approve the following
distribution:
 
Attorney’s Fees (30%) $45,000.00
Medical Expenses $19,100.77
Costs $4,332.11
 
Total Fees and Costs
$68,432.88
 
Total Settlement $150,000.00
Less Credits -$68,432.88
Net Settlement $81,567.12
 
However, the Court finds that the following issues preclude
granting the petition at this time:
 
1.     
Item
12(a)(3) of the petition indicates the total negotiated reduction is
$19,100.77, which does not match Item 12(b)(2)(f)(ii)(B) that indicates the
total negotiated reduction is $28,451.99.
 
2.     
Item
12(a)(4) of the petition is left blank and should list the total amount of
medical expenses to be reimbursed from the settlement proceeds as $19,100.77
(or whatever amount is correct).
 
3.     
Item
8(b)(1) of the proposed order incorrectly states the balance of the settlement
proceeds is $815,667.12 instead of $81,567.12. 
 
Accordingly,
the Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action of a Minor (Bradley
Ramirez, Age 16) is CONTINUED to ___________________________ _____, 2023 to
allow Counsel time to address and correct the above-identified issues. 
 
Counsel
is ordered to file a new updated petition and proposed order curing the
above-identified defects. 
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice.
