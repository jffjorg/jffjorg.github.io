Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The motion filed by Defendant's counsel, Alexandra Barreno, to be relieved as counsel is denied without prejudice. The Court has previously given counsel several opportunities to address the issues identified in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, but counsel has failed to comply with the requirements. The most recent filing of a revised declaration and proposed order on October 6, 2023, was not timely and served by mail on the client, which is not sufficient for a hearing on October 12, 2023. The Court will not continue the hearing again and denies the motion without prejudice. Counsel may file a new motion in full compliance with all legal requirements.
