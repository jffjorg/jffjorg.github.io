  - "Minimum contacts exist where the defendant's conduct in the forum state is such that he should reasonably anticipate being subject to suit there, and it is reasonable and fair to force him to do so."
  - "When claims to the property itself are the source of the underlying controversy between the plaintiff and the defendant, it would be unusual for the State where the property is located not to have jurisdiction."
```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Courtney N. Phillips, Trustee of the Clark living Trust dated January 19, 2023, has moved to quash the service of summons for lack of minimum contacts with this jurisdiction. The defendant argues that she is a resident of Louisiana, and the trust is sited in Nevada, where decedent was resident and where his estate was adjudicated. The defendant denies transacting any business in California, save for the filing of a petition to deem certain real property an asset of the trust, granted on October 16, 2023.

The court concludes that the plaintiff has established minimum contacts with this jurisdiction, as the claims arise out of the party's mutually exclusive claims to ownership of the same property. The defendant's purposeful contacts with California, including the filing of a petition to deem certain real property an asset of the trust, demonstrate that the defendant has fair warning that its activities might subject it to personal jurisdiction.

The motion to quash service of summons is therefore denied.
