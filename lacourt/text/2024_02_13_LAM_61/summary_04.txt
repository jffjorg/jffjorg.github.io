And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge grants the Defendant's motion for attorney fees and costs in the amount of $67,130.00 in fees and $1,023.72 in costs. The Defendant seeks fees and costs based on clauses in promissory notes that guarantee reimbursement of "all reasonable attorney fees and costs of collection". The Plaintiff argues that certain fees are unreasonable, including hours spent on the Defendant's respondent brief on appeal and preparation of the fee motion. The Judge finds that the fees incurred by the Defendant's counsel are reasonable and supported by attestations to their experience in similar or more-complex cases. However, the Judge reduces the fees sought by the Defendant's attorneys by $10,680.00 due to unexplained and unreasonable work performed prior to the filing of the Plaintiff's opening brief on appeal. The Judge also reduces the fees sought by the Defendant's attorneys in connection with the present fee motion by $16,680.00 due to the unreasonableness of the hours sought.
