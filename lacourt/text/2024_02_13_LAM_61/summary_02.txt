	* The demurrer is sustained as to affirmative defenses No. 1, 6, and 17, respectively for failure to state a claim, uncertainty of the pleadings, and right to modify, as these are not affirmative defenses in the proper sense.

And here is the summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike portions of the amended answer filed by the defendant, David Hanson Melmed. The Court has sustained the demurrer as to the first, sixth, and seventeenth affirmative defenses, which are unclear and do not provide sufficient notice to the plaintiff. The Court has also overruled the demurrer as to the remaining affirmative defenses, finding that they are properly stated. The Court has denied the motion to strike the same allegations. The plaintiffs, Seth Cohen and September Rea, are ordered to provide notice of the ruling. The Court will consider written oppositions to the tentative ruling before making a final decision.
