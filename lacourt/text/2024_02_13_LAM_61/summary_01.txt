And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel deposition filed by the Defendant, City of Los Angeles, against the Plaintiff, Sohel Sedghat. The Defendant seeks to compel the deposition of the Plaintiff after the Plaintiff failed to appear for examination on November 7, 2023, despite being served with a deposition notice on November 7, 2023. The Plaintiff objected to the motion, arguing that it was untimely and that the deposition notice did not comply with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure. However, the Judge found that the motion was timely and that the Plaintiff waived any objections to the notice by failing to serve a written objection in a timely manner. The Judge also found that the Defendant complied with the meet-and-confer requirements by seeking the Plaintiff's dates for deposition and responding to the Plaintiff's untimely objections. Therefore, the Judge granted the motion to compel deposition. Additionally, the Judge awarded sanctions against the Plaintiff in the amount of $625, representing 2.5 hours of attorney work at $250 per hour.
