  Case Number:  22STCV19075    Hearing Date:   February 13, 2024    Dept:  61  
I.       
MOTION TO
COMPEL DEPOSITION
A party may make a
motion compelling a witness’s deposition “after service of a deposition notice”
if that witness “fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2025.450, subd. (a).) The motion must include a meet-and-confer
declaration and show good cause for the discovery sought. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2025.450, subd. (b)(1), (2).)
 
Defendant
City of Los Angeles (Defendant) moves to compel the deposition of Plaintiff
Sohel Sedghat (Plaintiff). Defendant sought dates of availability from
Plaintiff prior to serving the deposition notice on November 7, 2023, but
Plaintiff did not respond to Defendant’s offer of dates. (Estrada Decl. ¶¶ 2–3,
Exhs. A, B.) Plaintiff only responded with an untimely objection on November
20, 2023, the day before the deposition was to take place. (Estrada Decl. ¶ 4,
Exh. C.) That same day, Defendant’s counsel warned Plaintiff that if he failed
to appear at the next day’s deposition, a motion to compel would follow.
(Estrada Decl. Exh. D.) A certificate of non-appearance was recorded on
November 21, 2023. (Estrada Decl. Exh. E.) 
 
Plaintiff
in opposition argues that the motion is untimely under Code of Civil Procedure
§ 2025.480. (Opposition at p. 2.) Plaintiff further argues that the deposition
notice did not state the manner of joining a remote deposition as required
under Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.220. (Opposition at p. 2.) Plaintiff
argues that Defendant failed to meet and confer before filing the present
motion. (Opposition at p. 3.) Plaintiff also objects to the seven hours
appointed for deposition and the requirement that it be videotaped, when the
incident in question was already recorded on bodycam footage. (Opposition at p.
4.)
 
Plaintiff’s
arguments in opposition are without merit. The motion is not untimely, as there
is no deadline in which to bring a motion to compel deposition under Code of
Civil Procedure § 2025.450, applicable, as here, where “a party to the action .
. . fails to appear for examination.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450, subd. (a).)
Although such a motion must be preceded by meet-and-confer efforts (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2025.450, subd. (b)(2)), Defendant here complied with this requirement
by seeking Plaintiff’s dates for deposition (to no response from Plaintiff) and
by responding to Plaintiff’s untimely objections prior to deposition, in which
they warned of the consequences of Plaintiff’s failure to appear.
 
Plaintiff objects that the
notice, one for remote deposition, did not provide all information required by
Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.220. (Opposition at p. 2.) But Plaintiff’s
objections to the notice were waived by the failure to serve them in timely
fashion: “Any party served with a deposition notice that does not comply with
Article 2 (commencing with Section 2025.210) waives any error or irregularity
unless that party promptly serves a written objection specifying that error or
irregularity at least three calendar days prior to the date for which the
deposition is scheduled, on the party seeking to take the deposition and any
other attorney or party on whom the deposition notice was served.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.410, subd. (a).) Plaintiff thus waived his objections here.
Plaintiff objects to taking the
deposition by video. But a party may notice that a deposition be so taken.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.220, subd. (a)(5).) Plaintiff objects that the notice
allows for seven hours of testimony. But a deposition may last for seven hours.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.290, subd. (a).) 
The motion to compel deposition
is therefore GRANTED. 
II.               
SANCTIONS
A party prevailing on a motion
to compel deposition is entitled to sanctions against the opposing party “unless
the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)
Defendants seeks $625 in
sanctions, representing 2.5 hours of attorney work at $250 per hour. (Estrada
Decl. ¶ 10.)  Sanctions are awarded
against Plaintiff in the amount of $625.
