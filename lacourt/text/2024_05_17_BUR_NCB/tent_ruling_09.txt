  Hearing Date:  May 17, 2024
 
 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motion to be relieved as counsel
 



 
Plaintiff’s counsel, Troy C. Skinner
(“Counsel”), moves to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Elisa Yarnell
(“Plaintiff”).  
Counsel filed this instant motion to be
relieved as counsel on April 19, 2024.  Counsel has filed the requisite forms pursuant
to CRC Rule 3.1362.  
According to the declaration of Counsel,
Counsel seeks to be relieved as counsel because Plaintiff did not voluntarily
consent to the request to be relieved as counsel.  (MC-052, §2.)  For these reasons, Counsel seeks to withdraw
from representing Plaintiff in this action. 

Counsel properly served Plaintiff at her
last known mailing address, which Counsel was unable to confirm.  Counsel mailed the motion papers to
Plaintiff’s last known address, return receipt requested, called Plaintiff’s
last known telephone number(s), and emailed Plaintiff’s last known email
address. 
As for future hearing dates, the Case
Management Conference and OSC re Failure to File Proof of Service of the
Summons and Complaint are set for May 29, 2024.  As no trial date has been set yet, there is
sufficient time for Plaintiff to obtain substitute counsel. 
Accordingly, the motion to be relieved as
counsel is granted.  The order electronically
lodged by Counsel will be signed at the hearing.  The order will become effective upon the
filing of a proof of service of a signed copy of the order on Plaintiff.  
Notice to be provided by Counsel.
