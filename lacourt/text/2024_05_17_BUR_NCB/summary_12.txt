The judge has granted a tentative ruling in a case between Plaintiff Hani Mammo and Defendant ABA LAW GROUP, et al. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants failed to perform legal services with reasonable care and skill, resulting in legal injuries and financial losses. The judge has sustained the Defendant's demurrer to the complaint with 20 days' leave to amend as to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd causes of action. The judge has also taken off-calendar the Defendant's motion to strike the request for punitive damages in the prayer for relief in the complaint, as the motion is now moot. The judge has ordered the Defendant to provide notice of the order.
