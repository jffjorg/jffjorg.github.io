BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations

Plaintiff Wendy Villalobos Saucedo, a
minor by and through her guardian ad litem Manuel Villalobos Rodriguez
(“Plaintiff”), alleges that Defendants Samsung SDI America, Inc. (“SDIA”),
Samsung Electronics America, Inc. (“SEAI”), Doe Cell Phone

Cell Phone Company Owners/Subsidiaries 31-40 either designed, manufactured,
assembled tested, distributed, advertised, inspected, sold, or supplied the
defective Samsung cellular phone.  Plaintiff
alleges that the subject cell phone was defective and unsafe for its intended
purpose such that it was capable of overheating and causing the subject cell
phone to explode, resulting in severe and permanent burn injuries to the user.  Plaintiff alleges that she used the subject
cell phone in its intended or reasonably foreseeable way, but that its
batteries overheated, such that it may catch fire and explode.  Plaintiff alleges that she suffered injuries
as a result of the defective product that lacked warnings.  
The complaint, filed January 23, 2023, alleges
causes of action for: (1) strict products liability (design defect and
manufacturing defect); (2) strict products liability (failure to warn); (3)
negligence (design, sale, manufacturing), (4) negligence (failure to warn); and
(5) breach of implied warranties.   
On March 30, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed
without prejudice the 5th cause of action for breach of implied
warranties only.

C.    
Motion
on Calendar 
On March 5, 2024, Samsung SDI America,
Inc. (“SDIA”) filed a motion to compel the depositions of Plaintiff and her
parents.  SDIA seeks $19,363.50 in
sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel.
On March 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
opposition brief.
On April 5, 2024, SDIA filed a reply
brief. 
The matter initially came for hearing on
April 12, 2024.  The Court continued the

further.  The Court ordered a dismissal
to be lodged by the end of the business day on May 9, 2024.  If a dismissal was not lodged by May 9, 2024,
the Court stated that it would consider the merits of the motion and/or hear an
update from the parties about the status of the case on May 17, 2024. 
The Court is not in receipt of a request
for dismissal. 
On May 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
supplemental opposition brief. 
On May 10, 2024, Defendant filed a
supplemental reply brief.
DISCUSSION

            SDIA moves to compel the
depositions of Plaintiff and her parents.  SDIA seeks $19,363.50 in sanctions against
Plaintiff, which accounts for $5,613.50 in costs (court reporter, videographer,
and Spanish translator for the depositions) and $13,750 in attorney’s fees (50
hours x $257/hour spent in connection with the depositions). 
            SDIA argues that it sent
correspondence to Plaintiff’s counsel on September 18, September 25, October
18, October 28, and November 3 in 2023, requesting Plaintiff to provide dates
for the depositions of Plaintiff and her parents.  SDIA states that as a professional courtesy,
the Zoom depositions set for Plaintiff and her parents in November 2023,
December 2023, and January 2024 were rescheduled to February 14, 15, and 16,
2024.  SDIA argues that Plaintiff and her
parents canceled the deposition hours before the scheduled time such that SDIA
took the non-appearances of Plaintiff and her parents for their failure to
appear to the properly noticed depositions. 
SDIA argues that Plaintiff’s deposition is necessary as she was the only
one in the room at the time the fire originated during the incident; the deposition
of her mother is necessary as she responded to the fire; and the deposition of
her father is necessary as he was the one who purchased, used, and maintained
the device that allegedly caused the fire, is knowledgeable about the aftermath
of the incident and Plaintiff’s medical treatment.  
            In opposition, Plaintiff
argues that her parents contacted Plaintiff’s counsel late on the evening of
February 13, 2024, the date before the deposition of Maria Villalobos
(Plaintiff’s mother), stating that they were too distraught to move forward
with the depositions and the case. 
Plaintiff’s counsel argues that they had no indication that Plaintiff’s
parents would cancel the deposition prior to that phone call, as Plaintiff and Mrs.
Villalobos were in the office the day before Mrs. Villalobos’s deposition.  Plaintiff argues that coinciding with
Plaintiff’s late cancellation, attorney Terrence Butler had a severe flare up
of cellulitis, which required immediate medical attention.  According to the opposition, due to Mrs.
Villalobos’ condition, Manuel Villalobos Rodriguez (Plaintiff’s father) has
informed Plaintiff’s counsel that he does not want to move forward with the
case.  Plaintiff’s counsel states that he
is willing to stipulate to sanctions for the cancellation of the depositions,
including Notices of Non-Appearance and defense counsel’s reasonable expenses
incurred in drafting the motion, but argues that the amount of sanctions
requested is exorbitant.  
            In light of the updates
provided by Plaintiff and counsel in the opposition brief, it appears that this
case will be dismissed by Plaintiff.  However,
at the time of the April 12, 2024 initial hearing on this matter, a request for
dismissal had has not yet been filed or entered, such that the Court continued
the hearing to May 17, 2024 and ordered Plaintiff to file a request for
dismissal by May 9, 2024.  The Court
stated in its April 12, 2024 order that if Plaintiff intended to move forward
with this action, the Court would hear the merits of this motion and the issue
of sanctions on May 17, 2024.  
            In Plaintiff’s
supplemental opposition, Plaintiff states that her counsel offered to dismiss
the action without prejudice with the payment of $5,613 in sanctions, which
would cover Defendant’s out-pocket costs. 
In discussions, defense counsel sought a dismissal with prejudice
and the payment of $12,484 in sanctions instead of originally requested
$19,363.50.[1]  Plaintiff’s counsel argues that dismissing
the case with prejudice would be unethical for counsel because he would be
dismissing a minor’s action with prejudice prior to the minor reaching the age
of majority.  In the supplemental reply
brief, SDIA seeks $19,363.50 in sanctions, as opposed to the $12,484 offer
during discussions.  
            Based on the papers
provided, the substantive merits of the motion is moot as the action will
eventually be dismissed by Plaintiff.  In
the absence of an agreement, Plaintiff has the right to dismiss without
prejudice. With respect to the amount of sanctions requested by SDIA, the Court
will award 5 hours in scheduling the depositions, 5 hours for preparing for the
depositions, and 10 hours for time spent related to this motion; total, the
Court will award 20 hours in attorney fees at $275/hour, or $5,500, plus
$5,613.50 in costs.  This amounts to $11,113.50
in sanctions.  
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
            Defendant Samsung SDI America,
Inc.’s motion to compel the depositions of Plaintiff and her parents is
substantively moot in light of the dismissal that will be entered.  The parties should further discuss whether
the dismissal will be entered with or without prejudice and Plaintiff should
file the appropriate request for dismissal. 

Plaintiff and her
counsel of record, jointly and severally, are ordered to pay monetary sanctions
in the amount of $11,113.50 to Defendant, by and through counsel, within 20
days of the entry of the dismissal. 
            Defendant shall provide notice of
this order.
