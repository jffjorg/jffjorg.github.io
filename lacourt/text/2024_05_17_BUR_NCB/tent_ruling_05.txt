  default judgment
 



 
BACKGROUND
A.    Allegations 
Plaintiff Moorpark Investors, LLC
(“Plaintiff”) alleges that on November 1, 2019, Plaintiff and Defendants Dena
Waldon and Joe Ann Waldon entered into a written lease agreement whereby
Defendants agreed to lease the premises located at 12246 Moorpark Street, Apt.
106T in Studio City from Plaintiff.  The
lease term was for 9 months, such that the lease expired on July 31, 2020.  Per the latest rent increase, the current
rent is alleged to be $3,529 per month, effective April 1, 2022.  
Plaintiff alleges that on September 7,
2021, Plaintiff served Defendants with a 15-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit with
Blank Declaration of COVID-19 Related Financial Distress for rent due September
1, 2020 to September 30, 2021.  Plaintiff
alleges that Defendants owed $42,250 in rent from September 2020 to September
2021.  (Compl., ¶17.)  Plaintiff alleges that on October 6, 2021, it
served Defendant with a 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit for rent due from
October 1, 2021 to October 3, 2022, such that Defendant owed $3,250 for rent in
October 2021.  Plaintiff alleges that
Plaintiff and Defendants submitted an application to the CA COVID-19 Rent
Relief Program for rental assistance owed from September 1, 2020 to September
30, 2021 and October 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021 in the amounts of $42,250 and
$3,250 respectively.  Plaintiff alleges
that: (a) check number 57437685 was processed for $42,250 from the program on
October 14, 2021 and issued to Dena Waldon, which was cashed by Defendants on
October 21, 2021; and (b) check number 57543742 was processed for $3,250 from
the program on October 18, 2021 and issued to Dena Waldon, which was cashed by
Defendants on November 19, 2021. 
Plaintiff alleges that it made repeated demands for the $45,500 in
COVID-19 rental debt, but Defendants have converted the funds for their own
use.
The complaint, filed December 20, 2022,
alleges causes of action for: (1) receipt of stolen property; (2) conversion;
(3) constructive trust; (4) money had and received; (5) unjust enrichment; (6)
declaratory relief; (7) breach of contract; and (8) fraud.

DISCUSSION
RE DENA WALDON’S MOTION
A.   
Request for Judicial Notice
Dena Waldon
requests judicial notice of documents filed in the case Moorpark Investors,
LLC v. Waldon (Pasadena Case No. 22PDUD01204), including the unlawful
detainer complaint, the Judgement – Unlawful Detainer, the October 25, 2022
Minute Order and Notice of Entry of Judgment, and Ex Parte Application for
Stay.  The request is granted.  (Evid. Code, § 453(d).)  
With the reply
brief, Defendants request judicial notice the October 25, 2022 Minute Order for
the Non-Jury Trial in the unlawful detainer case.  The request is granted. 
The October 25, 2022 minute order issued by the
Honorable William D. Dodson in the unlawful detainer case states in relevant
part: 
The
terms of a stipulated Judgment are recited orally on the record. 
Defendants
to move out by 12/18/22. No money owed.

Civil Procedure section 415.46. 
Restitution

Studio City, CA 91604 is granted for plaintiff(s)[.]
(10/25/22 Minute Order in LASC Case No. 22PDUD01204.)

B.     Merits of Motion 
Dena Waldon
moves to vacate the default based on extrinsic fraud.  
“A
judgment against a party may be set aside in equity when it is obtained by
extrinsic fraud or mistake.”  (Parage v. Couedel (1997)
60 Cal.App.4th 1037, 1044.)  “Extrinsic fraud usually arises when a party is denied
a fair adversary hearing because he has been ‘deliberately kept in ignorance of
the action or proceeding, or in some other way fraudulently prevented from
presenting his claim or defense.”  (Bae v. T.D. Service Co. of Arizona (2016) 245
Cal.App.4th 89, 97.)  In other words, “[e]xtrinsic fraud only arises when
one party has in some way fraudulently been prevented from presenting his or
her claim or defense.”  (Sporn
v. Home Depot USA, Inc. (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1294, 1300.)  
Dena Waldon
argues that Plaintiff filed the first action in Pasadena, which the parties
settled so that Plaintiff would be entitled to possession as of December 18,
2022 in exchange for Plaintiff waiving all back rent and damages.  Dena Waldon argues that this agreement was
fraudulently induced because Plaintiff did not intend to waive its claims, but
instead split its causes of action to file an action for the monetary damages.  (D. Waldon Decl., at p.5.)  Dena Waldon argues that Defendants vacated
the premises and removed their possessions before December 28, 2022, which was
before the time that Plaintiff’s process server in this action claimed to have
personally served Dena Waldon at the premises. 
(Id., at p.6.)  
According to the
proof of service filed on January 5, 2023, Dena Waldon was personally served on
December 28, 2022 at 5:25 p.m. at the apartment unit.  Service was effectuated by Victor Curiel, a
registered California process server.  
At most, Dena
Waldon provides her declaration stating that she vacated the premises before
December 28, 2022.  She states that she
was staying at different motels and couch-surfing at homes of friends and
relatives, but does not specify any dates. 
In her supplemental declaration (dated April 25, 2024), Dena Waldon
states that she rented a storage unit on December 17, 2022 and began removing
her property that day, stayed at various friends’ homes until she found a place
to move, and only came to the premises to remove her personal property.  (D. Waldon Suppl. Decl., at p.2; Ex. C [Lease
for storage unit].)  She states that she
finished moving everything out on December 27, 2022 at 12:25 p.m. and called
Plaintiff’s counsel to inform counsel that she had moved everything out.   (Id., Ex. D [T-Mobile call
record].)  Dena Waldon states that the
only evidence she has regarding her whereabouts on December 28, 2022 was her
U-Haul truck contract, which she used for her last load of personal property to
the storage unit; she returned the truck at 3:30 p.m.  (Id., Ex. E [U-Haul Equipment
Contract].)  
With respect to
the proof of service of the summons and complaint, Dena Waldon states that she
was not personally served on December 28, 2022 at 5:45 p.m. at the subject
premises, contrary to what the proof of service states.  The proof of service states that Dena Waldon
was served personally and describes the individual served as a female, age 40,
height 5’8”, weight 190, race: African America, black hair, and brown eyes.  Dena Waldon states that the process server
attempted service 3 times at the premises and that he only “pretended” to serve
her on December 28, 2022 as she was not physically there.  (D. Waldon Suppl. Decl., at p.2.)  She states that she does not look like “a short,
very fat, 40-year old.”  (Id.)  She states that she obtained a temporary
mailing address at 7555 Van Nuys Blvd., Van Nuys, CA 91405 and later her P.O.
Box (#361257, Los Angeles, CA 90036) as her new mailing address. (Id. at
pp.2-3.)  She states that she did not
learn about the new case until paralegal solicited her business in filing an
answer.  (Id. at p.3.)  
In the
supplemental reply brief, Plaintiff argues that Dena Waldon has not explained
her whereabouts at the time of service, her claim that service simply did not
happen is insufficient to refute the presumption of proper service by a
registered process server, and Dena Waldon filed an answer (which was later
stricken) such that she made a general appearance.  
The Court
ordered Dena Waldon to provide a supplemental declaration to describe her
whereabouts on December 28, 2022.  While
she provided some details up until 3:30 p.m., she has not provided any evidence
of where she was at the time of service at 5:45 p.m.  Although she claims that the process server pretended
to serve her or that personal service simply did not occur, there is no
evidence to support this other than her declaration statement.  Further, as pointed out by Plaintiff,
regardless of whether service was properly effectuated, such issues were waived
by Dena Waldon filed an answer on February 10, 2023.  Even though the answer was later stricken,
she nonetheless submitted to the Court’s jurisdiction at that time.  Thus, the motion will not be granted on the
basis that she was improperly served with the summons and complaint.  
Next, Dena
Waldon argues that the parties entered into a settlement agreement whereby
Plaintiff represented it would be waiving all back rent and damages.  A copy of the settlement terms (if one
exists) is not provided such that the Court cannot verify whether this was in
fact the case and to determine if Plaintiff engaged in fraudulent
activity.  However, a copy of the October
25, 2022 minute order is provided, which is quoted above in the request for
judicial notice section.  Dena Waldon
argues that the terms did not include a reservation by Plaintiff of monetary
issues for subsequent litigation.  
            In
the supplemental reply brief, Plaintiff argues that in most post-COVID eviction
cases with large balances where the cases are settled, Plaintiff reserves the
right to monies in a later case or through collection efforts because the jurisdictional
limit of the cases in limited jurisdiction courts was $25,000 as of December
2023.  Plaintiff argues that the parties
had agreed to reserve the money issue for later and that she discussed the case
with Dena Waldon that all money issues would be reserved for a later time in a
different case and that no money judgment would be awarded in the unlawful
detainer case.  In support of this
position, Plaintiff cites to the declaration of Monica Malek-Yonan at
paragraphs 6 and 7, but no declaration is attached to the supplemental reply
brief.  (See Suppl. Reply at p.3.)  In the alternative, Plaintiff requests that
if the Court needs more information, that the Court continue the hearing to May
17, 2024, as Plaintiff’s counsel believe that they can obtain a transcript of
the settlement haring by May 15, 2024.  (Suppl.
Reply at p.4.)  If Plaintiff obtains a
copy of the transcript, it should file the transcript and bring a copy of the
transcript to the hearing.  
            Based
on the plain language of the October 25, 2022 minute order, the parties agreed
Defendants would move out by December 18, 2022 and that no money would be
owed.  The minutes also reflect that
under the stipulated judgment, Plaintiff would recover $0.00 total against Dena
Waldon and Joe Ann Waldon.  There is no
other contrary evidence to the terms. 
Although Plaintiff cites to Ms. Malek-Yonan’s declaration, no
declaration is attached to the supplemental reply.  Further, even if Ms. Malek-Yonan had provided
her declaration, it appears that Plaintiff’s reservation of monetary claims
would have been based on oral communications only as no other documentary
evidence has been provided to show email or letter communications where the
parties agreed that Plaintiff was reserving monetary claims for a separate,
unlimited action.  Although Plaintiff
argues that it is typical for landlords to reserve monetary claims separate
from limited unlawful detainer actions in post-COVID eviction cases, the fact
that this may be the ordinary practice of Plaintiff does not show that this was
the practice implemented in this particular action.  
             Here, Dena Waldon has shown that there is a
valid argument that she believed that no rent was due and owing based on the
oral stipulated judgment that was recorded by Department R of the Pasadena
Courthouse.  Plaintiff has not shown
otherwise that it intended to pursue monetary claims against Dena Waldon
following the conclusion of the unlawful detainer case.  Thus, the Court grants Dena Waldon’s motion
to vacate the default entered in this action on the grounds that she believed
she was fraudulently induced to enter into the underlying stipulated judgment
in the unlawful detainer case, causing her to believe that no action for
monetary damages would be sought against her by Plaintiff. 
DISCUSSION RE JOE
ANN WALDON’S MOTION
            Defendant Joe Ann Waldon moves to
vacate the order striking the answer, default, and default judgment, pursuant
to CCP § 657(1).  
The Court notes that CCP § 657(1) is regarding vacating a verdict and to
seek a new trial due to irregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury, or
adverse party, or any order of the court or abuse of discretion by which either
party was prevented from having a fair trial. 

As an initial matter, CCP § 657(1) is not the correct code section for
Joe Ann Waldon to seek relief.  Section
657 is employed following the conclusion of a trial.  Here, no trial has been conducted.  As Joe Ann Waldon has not sought relief based
on a proper legal ground, the motion is denied on this basis.  
If considering the merits, Joe Ann Waldon argues that she paid her filing
fees but the Court was misinformed that she had not paid the fees.  Joe Ann Waldon argues that the Court
improperly struck her answer based on this misinformation, resulting in her
default and the default judgment.  Joe
Ann Waldon provides a receipt dated March 15, 2023 showing that Dena Waldon
paid $435 for case no. 22BBCV01265 for “unlimited Civil – Ans non-Plaintiff
incl. UD.”  (Mot., Exhibit.)  However, the receipt shows that Dena
Waldon paid her own fees.  There is
no showing that Joe Ann Waldon paid her fees or that they were paid on
her behalf.  
In addition, as pointed out by Plaintiff in opposition, the Court held a
Case Management Conference on May 11, 2023 and noted that Dena Waldon filed an
answer after defaulting and that Joe Ann Waldon filed her answer without paying
the required filing fee.  (Opp., Ex.
D.)  The Court continued the CMC to July
27, 2023 and set an OSC re: Striking the Answers of both Defendants.  (Id.) 
On May 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed with the Court and served on Defendants
the Notice of Ruling at CMC.  (Id.,
Ex. E.)  On July 27, 2023, the Court held
the CMC and OSC and struck the answers filed by Defendants for their failure to
appear.  (Id., Ex. F.)  Thus, Defendants had notice of and the
opportunity to attend the CMC and OSC hearing, but they failed to do so.  Further, though there was ground to strike
Joe Ann Waldon’s answer for failure to pay fees, the Court deferred the
striking of the answer to allow time for Joe Ann Waldon to attend the CMC and
OSC, but she failed to appear.  Thus, the
striking of the answer was proper.  
The Court notes that this was the only ground upon which Joe Ann Waldon
has moved for relief in the motion papers. 
The motion to vacate the order striking the answer and for relief from
the default and default judgment is denied on this ground.
However, Joe Ann Waldon argued for the first time in the reply brief that
the default was entered as a result of extrinsic fraud, as similarly argued by
Dena Waldon.  As this was raised for the
first time in the reply brief, this is an improper argument that the Court may
decline to consider.  Nevertheless, the
Court continued the hearing on the motion and allowed Plaintiff to file a
supplemental opposition to Joe Ann Waldon’s reply brief and Joe Ann Waldon to
file a supplemental reply brief.  As
noted above, Plaintiff did not file a supplemental opposition to Joe Ann
Waldon’s reply arguments.  
As Joe Ann Waldon’s reply arguments are similar to those raised by Dena
Waldon, the Court grants Joe Ann Waldon’s motion on the same basis as it
granted Dena Waldon’s motion.  
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
            Defendant Dena Waldon’s motion for relief from default and default judgment
is granted.  
Defendant Joe Ann Waldon’s motion for relief from default and default
judgment is granted.    
Defendants are ordered to file their
answers following the hearing on this matter. 

A Case Management Conference is set on
July 18, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in this Department. 
            Defendants shall provide notice of
this order.
