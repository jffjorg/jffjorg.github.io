And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff, 4000 Burbank, LLC, has filed a motion to unseal the record in this case. The defendant, Elani Kinoshita, and her husband, Chad Tadashi Kinoshita, have defaulted on the payment terms of a stipulated judgment. The plaintiff argues that the court must unseal the record based on the parties' stipulation and the interests of justice. However, the court has denied the motion to unseal the record without prejudice. The court notes that the case was not sealed in the first place, and the plaintiff has not specified which particular records it seeks to unseal. The court has ordered the plaintiff to file a new motion that specifically names the documents it seeks to unseal and addresses the factors in CRC Rule 2.550 and 2.551.
