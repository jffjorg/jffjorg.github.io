Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court granted the motion to amend the judgment to add Betty Jo Kim McIntosh, as trustee of the McIntosh Trust, as a judgment debtor in this action. The Court also granted the request for an order authorizing and directing the Sheriff's Office to levy the subject property, 926 Hilldale Avenue, West Hollywood, CA 90069, and to take any further action necessary to accomplish the execution of the outstanding judgment and order for payment. The Court ordered the Trustees of the McIntosh Trust to be enjoined from transferring any interest in the Hilldale property prior to the Sheriff's levy. The Court's ruling is based on the fact that Betty Jo Kim McIntosh is the settlor and beneficiary of the revocable McIntosh Trust, and therefore is liable as a matter of law for the judgment and post-judgment order. The Court's ruling is also based on the fact that the outstanding judgment and order are not enforceable in their current form.
