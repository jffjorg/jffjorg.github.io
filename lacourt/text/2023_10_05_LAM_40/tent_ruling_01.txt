 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant Brett
  Hazard’s Demurrer to Complaint



 
Background
Pleading
Plaintiff Samantha Gerlach sues Defendant Brett Hazard and Does 1 through
50 pursuant to a March 21, 2023 Complaint alleging claims of (1) Breach of The
Common Law Duty of Care [Negligence, Negligent Infliction of Emotional
Distress], (2) Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment in Violation of Cal.
Civ. Code § 1942.5, (3) Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment in Violation
of Cal. Civ. Code § 1940.2, (4) Violation of the Tenant Anti-Harassment
Ordinance, L.A.M.C. Art. 5.3, and (5) Unfair and Unlawful Business Practices in
Violation of California Business & Professions Code § 17200, et seq.
The claims arise from allegations that Plaintiff Gerlach first rented the
property at 1214 N Evergreen Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90033 from a
predecessor in interest of Defendant Brett Hazard and that since taking
ownership of the Property, Defendant Hazard has engaged in a pattern and practice
of unlawful behavior that not only caused or permitted uninhabitable conditions
at the Property, but also harassed Plaintiff. The uninhabitable conditions
alleged by Plaintiff include peeling floors, unsealed bathtub, cracked bathroom
sink, and/or no heating system, for which Defendants were twice cited by the Los
Angeles Housing Department (LAHD) between January 2021 and January 2022. The
harassment alleged by Plaintiff includes coercive cash for keys offers between
May 2020 and May 2022 (during the COVID-19 pandemic), excessive and retaliatory
notices to enter the Property, and actual unlawful entries into the Property.
Plaintiff also pleads retaliation by Defendant Hazard against Plaintiff Gerlach
based on Gerlach exercising her rights to decline “cash for keys” offers and to
seek administrative relief from the LAHD for substandard conditions at the
Property. Such retaliation includes threats of termination of tenancy
(including during the COVID-19 pandemic) and scheduling LAHD visits to coincide
with times at which Plaintiff would be unavailable to meet with housing
inspectors, leading to the closure of Plaintiff’s complaints with the LAHD, as
well as destroying Plaintiff’s garden on the Property, leaving debris or trash
on the floor after performing repairs on the Property, badmouthing Plaintiff as
a problem tenant to Defendant Hazard’s contractors and the LAHD housing
inspectors, attempting to enter the Property without first giving notice to
Plaintiff (including after Plaintiff changed the locks and installed a security
system), and refusing to deposit Plaintiff’s rent checks between May 2022 and
February 2023.
Motion Before Court
On June 14, 2023, Defendant Hazard demurred to the Complaint’s five
causes of action on sufficiency and uncertainty of pleading grounds. The
demurrer was set for a hearing on October 5, 2023.
On August 10, 2023, Plaintiff Gerlach opposed the demurrer.
No reply by Defendant Hazard
appears in the record.
Defendant Hazard’s demurrer is now
before the Court.
 
Demurrer
Demurrer
Sufficiency Standard
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (e).) This device can be used only to challenge defects that
appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the
pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a [general] demurrer, the complaint need only
allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that
might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A.
v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) In
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth
of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) A demurrer, however, “does not admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab
Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept.
of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other
grounds, Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th
1158, 1162.) The face of the complaint includes exhibits attached to the
complaint. (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.) If facts
appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits
take precedence. (Holland v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86
Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in White
v. Cridlebaugh (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 506, 521.)
Uncertainty
Legal Standard 
A
demurrer to a pleading lies where the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, or
unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10, subd. (f).) “A demurrer for
uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects
uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th
612, 616, disapproved on other grounds in Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title
Guar. Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 46 [holding claims for unfair business
practices need not be pled specifically, impliedly disapproving Khoury].)
As a result, a special demurrer for uncertainty is not intended to reach
failure to incorporate sufficient facts in the pleading but is directed only at
uncertainty existing in the allegations already made. (People v. Taliaferro
(1957) 149 Cal.App.2d 822, 825, disapproved on other grounds in Jefferson v.
J.E. French Co. (1960) 54 Cal.2d 717, 719-720 [statute of limitations
question].) Where complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action and to
apprise defendant of issues he is to meet, it is not properly subject to a
special demurrer for uncertainty. (See ibid.; see also Gressley v.
Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643 [“A special demurrer [for
uncertainty] should be overruled where the allegations of the complaint are
sufficiently clear to apprise the defendant of the issues which he is to
meet”].)
I.
Complaint,
First Cause of Action, Breach of The Common Law Duty of Care [Negligence,
Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress]: OVERRULED.
“‘The
elements of a cause of action for negligence are … “(a) a legal duty to use due
care; (b) a breach of such legal duty; [and] (c) the breach as the proximate or
legal cause of the resulting injury.”’” (Ladd v. County of San Mateo
(1996) 12 Cal.4th 913, 917.)
The
first cause of action alleges that as Plaintiff’s landlord, Defendant Hazard
owes Plaintiff a common law duty of care to comply with ordinances,
regulations, and other laws to ensure a sound and safe living environment for
Plaintiff—e.g., Civil Code section 3304—and that Defendant Hazard breached
those duties by unlawfully entering Plaintiff’s unit on multiple occasions
without notice, permitting substandard conditions at the Property, retaliating
against Plaintiff for exercising her right to seek administrative relief with
the LAHD, and unlawfully demanding “cash for keys” from Plaintiff. (Complaint,
¶¶ 29-31.) These conditions and conduct by Defendant Hazard are alleged in
paragraphs 10 to 25 of the Complaint, are summarized above, and are
incorporated into the first cause of action. (See Background, Pleadings supra;
see also Complaint, ¶ 29.)
In
his demurrer, Defendant Hazard argues that the first cause of action is not
properly pleaded because it is alleged in a conclusory fashion, does not
alleged a specific duty of care from Defendant Hazard to Plaintiff Gerlach, and
cites to a Civil Code section that does not establish duty under a negligence
claim. Elsewhere, Defendant Gerlach argues outside the scope of the pleadings
and argues that any negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED) component
of this claim is nothing more than negligence. (Demurrer, p. 5.)
In
opposition, Plaintiff Gerlach argues that general allegations of the elements
for negligence suffice to state a cause of action, such that a plaintiff need
not plead a violation of a specific ordinance to state a negligence claim, with
Plaintiff citing to the Complaint and to legal authority in support. Plaintiff
Gerlach also argues—in agreement with the demurrer—that she pleads negligence
by way of allegations of NIED and that negligence, as based on NIED, is
properly pleaded in the Complaint. (Opp’n, pp. 2-4.)
No
reply is before the Court.
The
Court agrees that NIED is not an independent cause of action but also
recognizes that insofar as the first cause of action alleges negligence based
on multiple theories of negligence by Defendant Hazard, one of those multiple
theories can be NIED. (Potter v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. (1993)
6 Cal.4th 965, 984-985; accord. Delfino v. Agilent Technologies, Inc.
(2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 790, 818; Marllene F. v. Affiliated Psychiatric Inc.
(1989) 48 Cal.3d 583, 588.) As such, the Court agrees with Plaintiff on this
point.
Turning
to whether the first cause of action sufficiently pleads negligence, the Court
finds in favor of Plaintiff Gerlach.
The
Complaint sufficiently pleads a landlord-tenant relationship. (See, e.g., Complaint,
¶¶ 1-2, 5-8, 30.) A common law duty of care applies to landlord-tenant
relationships. (Stoiber v. Honeychuck (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903, 923 [“[B]ecause
we are dealing with the landlord-tenant relationship and the responsibilities
of owners and occupiers of real property, we believe the better approach is to
apply the rationale of Rowland v. Christian, supra, 69 Cal.2d 108
…, and hold the common law duty of care to be that specified in Civil Code
section 1714 that all persons must exercise due care in the management of their
property to avoid foreseeable injury to others”].)
Here,
the Complaint pleads negligence arising from Defendant Hazard permitting and
failing to remedy substandard conditions at the Property, omissions that resulted
in two inspections and citations by the LAHD against Defendant Hazard for
uninhabitable conditions. (Complaint, ¶¶ 15, 23, 29-31.)
To
the extent that Defendant Hazard sought to challenge one or more of the various
theories of negligence alleged in the first cause of action, such relief is not
proper pursuant to a demurrer; a motion to strike was needed. (Kong v. City
of Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency (2002) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1047
[“A demurrer cannot rightfully be sustained to part of a cause of action or to
a particular type of damage or remedy”]; Pierson v. Sharp Memorial Hospital,
Inc. (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 340, 342 [A motion to strike is generally used
to reach defects in a pleading that are not subject to demurrer]; see Demurrer,
p. 5 [challenging NIED portion of negligence claim]; see also Complaint, ¶ 31
[alleging four alternative grounds for negligence].)
Defendant
Hazard’s demurrer is therefore OVERRULED as to the Complaint’s first cause of
action.
II.
Complaint,
Second Cause of Action, Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment in Violation
of Cal. Civ. Code § 1942.5: OVERRULED.
Civil
Code section 1942.5 prohibits landlords from evicting residential tenants, raising
their rent, or decreasing housing services in retaliation against the exercise
of lawful tenant rights. (See Civ. Code, § 1942.5, subds. (a), (d), (h).)
The
second cause of action alleges that “Defendant Hazard retaliated against
Plaintiff through their threatening and menacing actions. Defendant Hazard
violated the covenant of quiet enjoyment by, unlawfully entering Plaintiff’s
unit on multiple occasions without notice, permitting substandard conditions at
the Property, retaliating against Plaintiff for exercising her right to seek
administrative relief with the Los Angeles Housing Department, and unlawfully
demanding ‘cash for keys’ from Plaintiff.” (Complaint, ¶ 39.) The second cause
of action incorporates prior allegations, such as that Defendant Hazard made threats of termination of tenancy (including
during the COVID-19 pandemic), scheduled LAHD visits to coincide with times at
which Plaintiff would be unavailable to meet with housing inspectors, leading
to the closure of Plaintiff’s complaints with the LAHD, destroyed Plaintiff’s
garden on the Property, left debris or trash on the floor after performing
repairs on the Property, badmouthed Plaintiff as a problem tenant to Defendant
Hazard’s contractors and the LAHD housing inspectors, attempted to enter the
Property without first giving notice to Plaintiff (including after Plaintiff
changed the locks and allegedly installed a security system), and refused to
deposit Plaintiff’s rent checks between May 2022 and February 2023. (Complaint,
¶¶ 15-25, 37.)
In his demurrer, Defendant Hazard argues in
effect that the Complaint does not allege retaliation following Plaintiff’s
alleged exercise of her rights through the LAHD in January 2021 because the
complained-of conduct precedes this date, because the dates of harassment are
unclear, or because this statutory section may not be invoked more than once in
any 12-month period. (Demurrer, pp. 5-6.)
In opposition, Plaintiff Gerlach argues that the
Complaint pleads two bases for liability pursuant to Civil Code section 1942.5,
subdivisions (a) and (d). The first ground is the allegations relating to the
LAHD complaints and subsequent retaliation. The second ground is the
allegations relating to Defendants Hazard’s conduct in seeking “cash for keys”
from Plaintiff Gerlach. Plaintiff also argues that the 12-month limitation on
section 1942.5 involves a 12-month restriction on using this statutory section more
than once in a year for affirmative defense purposes (subd. (b)), and that such
restriction does not limit a private right of action (subd. (h)) (Opp’n, pp.
4-6.)
No reply is before the Court.
The Court finds in favor of Plaintiff
Gerlach.
The Complaint sufficiently alleges that
Defendant Hazard retaliated against Plaintiff Gerlach for making complaints of
uninhabitable conditions with the LAHD, including by allegedly threatening to
terminate Plaintiff’s tenancy, physically destroying Plaintiff’s garden, using
repairs as a pretense to enter Plaintiff’s home, and badmouthing Plaintiff.
(Complaint, ¶¶ 15-20.) Moreover, as alleged, the threat to terminate tenancy
and destruction of Plaintiff’s garden could have taken place within 180 days of
the LAHD complaint being made in January 2021. (Complaint, ¶¶ 17-18.)
The Court also finds that while subdivision
(b) of section 1942.5 limits the use of that statutory section to once per year,
here, there is no allegation in the Complaint that Plaintiff made use of
section 1942.5 against Defendant Gerlach within one year of bringing this suit.
Neither does the demurrer sufficiently explain why one cause of action for
violation of section 1942.5 cannot rely on more than one factual background to
support liability.
Defendant
Hazard’s demurrer is therefore OVERRULED as to the Complaint’s second cause of
action.
III.
Complaint,
Third Cause of Action, Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment in Violation
of Cal. Civ. Code § 1940.2: OVERRULED.
It
is unlawful for a landlord to, for the purpose of influencing a tenant to
vacate a dwelling: 
(1)
Engage in conduct that violates subdivision (a) of Section 484 of the Penal
Code. 
(2)
Engage in conduct that violates Section 518 of the Penal Code. 
(3)
Use, or threaten to use, force, willful threats, or menacing conduct
constituting a course of conduct that interferes with the tenant’s quiet
enjoyment of the premises in violation of Section 1927 that would create an
apprehension of harm in a reasonable person. Nothing in this paragraph requires
a tenant to be actually or constructively evicted in order to obtain
relief. 
(4)
Commit a significant and intentional violation of Section 1954. 
(5)
Threaten to disclose information regarding or relating to the immigration or
citizenship status of a tenant, occupant, or other person known to the landlord
to be associated with a tenant or occupant. This paragraph does not require a
tenant to be actually or constructively evicted in order to obtain relief.
(Civil Code, § 1940.2, subds. (a)(1)-(5).)
The
third cause of action alleges that “Defendant Hazard breached the covenant of
quiet enjoyment through their threatening and menacing actions. Defendant
Hazard violated the covenant of quiet enjoyment by, unlawfully entering
Plaintiff’s unit on multiple occasions without notice, permitting substandard
conditions at the Property, retaliating against Plaintiff for exercising her
right to seek administrative relief with the Los Angeles Housing Department,
and unlawfully demanding ‘cash for keys’ from Plaintiff.” (Complaint, ¶ 48.)
In
his demurrer, Defendant Hazard argues that the third cause of action is not
sufficiently pleaded because the Complaint’s allegations do not rise to a
substantial interference with the tenant’s ability to use and enjoy the
premises. (Demurrer, p. 6.)
In
opposition, Plaintiff Gerlach argues that the third cause of action is
sufficiently pleaded for various reasons. First, Plaintiff argues that “[i]t is
patent that facts that would satisfy the examples of violations prohibited in
Civil Code § 1940.2 would also be ‘substantial’ within the meaning of the
common law.” Second, Plaintiff argues that “Plaintiff’s allegations here are a
fortiari [sic] substantial interferences” that rise to the level of
interference in the case cited by Defendant Hazard’s demurrer, e.g., allegations
related to needing to change the locks to keep Defendant Hazard from entering
the Property, paying for a security system, and manifestations of stress.
(Opp’n, pp. 6-7.)
No
reply is before the Court.
The
Court finds in favor of Plaintiff Gerlach.
Here,
the allegations in the Complaint are incorporated into the third cause of
action and sufficiently allege a violation of section 1940.2. Section 1940.2 is
violated where the landlord commits a significant and intentional violation of Civil
Code section 1954, which provides the conditions pursuant to which a landlord
may legally enter a dwelling unit. (Civ. Code, §§ 1940.2, subd. (a)(4), 1954,
subd. (a)-(a)(6).) Here, the Complaint alleges that on various occasions,
Defendant Hazard entered the Property without giving notice of his intent to
enter the Property, without Plaintiff’s consent, and under circumstances where
his conduct was intentional (e.g., Defendant and his agents entering the
Property after Plaintiff had changed the locks, thus seemingly forcing entry).
(Complaint, ¶¶ 13, 24, 45, 48; see also Complaint, ¶¶ 13, 19, 21.) Such
allegations rise to the level of violation of Civil Code section 1940.2,
subdivision (a)(4).
Defendant
Hazard’s demurrer is therefore OVERRULED as to the Complaint’s third cause of
action.
IV.
Complaint,
Fourth Cause of Action, Violation of the Tenant Anti-Harassment Ordinance,
L.A.M.C. Art. 5.3: OVERRULED.
Article
5.3 of Chapter IV the Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC) prohibits tenant
harassment. (LAMC, § 45.33 [defining harassment].) “An aggrieved tenant under
this article, or any person, organization, or entity who will fairly and
adequately represent the interests of an aggrieved tenant(s) under this
article, may institute civil proceedings as provided by law, against any
landlord violating any of the provisions of this article and any person who
aids, facilitates, and/or incites another to violate the provisions of this
article, regardless of whether the rental unit remains occupied or has been
vacated due to harassment.” (LAMC § 45.35(A).)
The
fourth cause of action alleges that Defendant Hazard violated the LAMC
anti-harassment ordinance by unlawfully attempting to or in fact entering enter
the Property, attempting to coerce Plaintiff into accepting “cash for keys,”
and refusing to deposit Plaintiff’s rent payments. (Complaint, ¶ 54; see
Complaint, ¶¶ 12, 24, 25, 51.)
In
his demurrer, Defendant Hazard argues that the Complaint alleges harassment
based on legitimate aims and that that the Complaint does not sufficiently
allege the intent necessary for this claim. (Demurrer, pp. 6-7.)
In
opposition, Plaintiff Gerlach cites the Complaint at paragraphs 51 to 55 in
support of this claim. Plaintiff Gerlach also cites legal authority in support
of the claim. (Opp’n, pp. 7-8.) 
No
reply is before the Court.
The
Court finds in favor of Plaintiff Gerlach.
The
Court adopts its discussion in relation to the third cause of action to find
harassment in the form of alleged unlawful entries into the Property by
Defendant Hazard or his agents.
Defendant
Hazard’s demurrer is therefore OVERRULED as to the Complaint’s fourth cause of
action.
V.
Complaint,
Fifth Cause of Action, Unfair and Unlawful Business Practices in Violation of
California Business & Professions Code § 17200, et seq.: OVERRULED.
To
state a cause of action for unfair business practices, a plaintiff must
establish defendant engaged in “unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or
practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising.” (Bus. &
Prof. Code, § 17200.) This section establishes three types of unfair
competition, prohibiting “practices that are either ‘unfair,’ or ‘unlawful,’ or
‘fraudulent.’” (Pastoria v. Nationwide Ins. (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1490,
1496.) Thus, “[a]n act or practice may be actionable as “unfair” under the
unfair competition law even if it is not ‘unlawful.’” (Chavez v. Whirlpool
Corp. (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 363, 374.) A violation of other laws is deemed
independently actionable under the UCL. (See Law Offices of Mathew Higbee v.
Expungement Assistance Servs. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 544, 554.) “‘Virtually
any law—federal, state or local—can serve as a predicate for a section 17200
action.’” (Ibid., quoting Troyk v. Farmers Group, Inc. (2009) 171
Cal.App.4th 1305, 1335).) 
Despite
the broad scope of Business and Professions Code section 17200, its remedies
are limited to equitable relief; damages are not recoverable. (Korea Supply
Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (2003) 29 Cal.4th 1134, 1144.) 
The
fifth cause of action alleges unfair business practices based on the
allegations relating to Defendant Hazard unlawfully making entry into the
Property, permitting substandard conditions in the Property, retaliating
against Plaintiff, demanding “cash for keys,” and violating Civil Code sections
1940.2 and 1942.5 and LAMC article 5.3, among other things. Plaintiff seeks
equitable relief for this cause of action. (Complaint, ¶¶ 60-63, 66.)
In
his demurrer, Defendant Hazard argues that section 17200 applies to conduct
affecting other businesses, not to individuals. Defendant Hazard also argues
that Plaintiff can be made whole through damages, making equitable relief
improper. (Demurrer, pp. 6-7.)
In
opposition, Plaintiff Gerlach argues that an individual may be liable for
conduct violating the unfair business practices statute, citing statutory
authority in support. Plaintiff also argues that the economic damages requested
in relation to other claims do not affect her entitlement to the equitable
relief pleaded in the Complaint. (Opp’n, pp. 8-9.)
No
reply is before the Court.
The
Court finds in favor of Plaintiff Gerlach.
First,
any person can be liable for a section 17200 violation, where the term “person”
includes “natural persons, corporations, firms, partnerships, joint stock
companies, associations and other organizations of persons.” (Bus. & Prof.
Code, §§ 17200, 17201, 17203.)
Second,
contrary to Defendant Hazard’s unsupported argument, an individual has standing
to maintain a section 17200 claim if he or she “has suffered injury in fact and
has lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition.” (Bus. &
Prof. Code, § 17204.) Here, the Complaint alleges loss of money and property
and incorporates prior allegations. (Complaint, ¶¶ 56, 64.) 
Third,
the Court adopts the tortious and statutory violations discussed in relation to
the first through fourth causes of action to find that sufficient illegality
supports the fifth cause of action.
Fourth,
the Court notes that the fifth cause of action properly requests equitable
relief, including “restitution; disgorgement of Defendants’ ill-gotten gains;
injunctive relief; and an award of attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to
California Code of Civil Procedure §1021.5 and other applicable law.”
(Complaint, ¶ 66.) To the extent that any of this equitable relief is not
proper, it could only be challenged by way of motion to strike. (Pierson v.
Sharp Memorial Hospital, Inc., supra, 216 Cal.App.3d at p. 342.)
Defendant
Hazard’s demurrer is therefore OVERRULED as to the Complaint’s fifth cause of
action.
VI.
Complaint,
Prayer, Punitive Damages: IMPROPER.
Defendant
Hazard’s demurrer is IMPROPER insofar as it challenges the allegations and
prayer for punitive damages (see Demurrer, pp. 7-8) because the adequacy of
punitive damages cannot be challenged in a demurrer, but rather, must be
challenged in a motion to strike. (Grieves v. Superior Court (1984) 157
Cal.App.3d 159, 163-164.)  

Conclusion
Defendant Brett Hazard’s Demurrer [to Complaint] is OVERRULED, in Part,
and IMPROPER, in Part, as follows:
(1) OVERRULED as to the Complaint’s first through fifth causes of action;
and
(2) IMPROPER as to the Complaint’s prayer for punitive damages.
