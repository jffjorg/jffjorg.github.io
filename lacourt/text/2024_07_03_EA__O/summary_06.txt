And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on the parties' disputes. The plaintiff is suing Investors on a vicarious liability theory, but the plaintiff is also a cross-defendant. The judge presumes that the plaintiff took the motion off calendar because of improper notice, as the demurrer was required to be served by May 3, 2024, but was untimely served on May 7. The parties have met and conferred, and the judge notes that the plaintiff has not set forth an analysis as to why the alleged scheme does not fall under the purview of the Unfair Competition Law (UCL). The judge concludes that the plaintiff's allegations, while claiming to be a victim of the engineer's purported fraudulent scheme, are irrelevant to the allegations found within the Complaint. The judge is looking to the court's discretion to prohibit new schemes to defraud, citing Motors, Inc. v. Times Mirror Co. and Kwikset Corp. v. Sup. Court.
