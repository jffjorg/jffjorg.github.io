 Case Number:  24PSCV00346    Hearing Date:   July 3, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
DEMURRER TO CROSS-COMPLAINT BY BALKAR S. DEOL AND BM
FREIGHT, INC. is SUSTAINED with leave to amend, namely as the Engineers do
not have standing. 
 
Background
 
This case arises from purported misrepresentations in
relation to the purchase of real property. Plaintiffs BALKAR S. DEOL and BM
FREIGHT INC (collectively, “Plaintiff”) allege the following against LAKSHMI
KAPOOR, an individual and INVESTORS TEAM REALTY, INC. (collectively, “Agents”);[1]
HANIF DAUD, an individual, SAMAN MAHMOOD, an individual, and ICON ATELIER INC.
(collectively, “engineers”): Plaintiff owns and operates a trucking business.
(FAC ¶15.) In January 2022, Plaintiff
engaged the Agents to purchase a vacant commercial property, which Agents
assured Plaintiff that he could secure approvals for outdoor parking of
the 18 big rig trucks and then go on to build the desired offices, truck wash
areas, and repair area (hereafter “Trucking Facilities”). The Agents, however,
made false representations namely that (i) the Engineers were licensed (they
were not), (ii) that the easement holder agreed to sell the rights (no such
agreement), and (iii) that the City of Redlands approved the use for immediate
outdoor truck parking (which City stated under no circumstances would be
allowed). (See FAC generally.) To date, Plaintiff seeks to recover $365,600.00
for various damages including real estate broker commission, interest payments
on the property, and $48,000.00 paid to the engineers for work they did not do.

 
On February 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed suit.
 
On March 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed a FAC against the
Defendants for: 1.    
Fraud & Deceit 2.    
Breach Of Contract 3.    
Breach Of Fiduciary Duty 4.    
Rescission 5.    
Unjust Enrichment 6.    
Unfair Competition [BPC § 17200]
 
On May 1, 2024, the Engineers filed their answer. That same
day, the Engineers filed a cross-complaint (CC) for one count of VIOLATION OF
BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE § 17200 asserted against Plaintiff, PARMINDER
SINGH and ANTERJEET KAUR. (Parminder and Anterjeet and are Deol’s son in law
and daughter, respectively.)[2] 
 
On May 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed a demurrer to the Engineers’
CC.
 
On May 15, 2024, Kapoor filed her answer to Plaintiff’s FAC.
That same day, Investors filed a separate answer.
 
On May 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed a demurrer to an answer.
(It is unclear what answer the demurrer is to.) 
 
On May 17, 2024, the Engineers filed their opposition to
Plaintiff’s demurrer. That same day, Plaintiff filed a notice of removing the
demurrer with Reservation ID: 483530449529 off-calendar. “Said Demurrer will be
re-noticed and re-filed with a new reservation ID for June 18, 2024.” That same
day, Plaintiff filed the instant demurrer.[3]
 
On May 29, 2024, the Agents each filed respective amended
answers to Plaintiff’s FAC.
 
Discussion[4]
 
Plaintiff demurs to the Unfair Competition COA on the
grounds that it fails to allege state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action (CCP § 430.10 (e)), lacks standing, lacks specificity, and is
unintelligible (CCP § 430.10 (f)). (Demurrer p. 2.) 
 
To state a cause of action under Business & Professions Code §
17200, a plaintiff must allege (1) a business practice, (2) that is unfair,
unlawful or fraudulent; and (3) an authorized remedy. Under the UCL, prevailing plaintiffs “are
generally limited to injunctive relief and restitution.” (Cel-Tech
Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. (1999) 20
Cal.4th 163, 179). 
 
In turn, the court turns to the allegations in the CC: 
 
[Plaintiff], ANTERJEET KAUR, and
PARMINDER SINGH, violated California Business and Professions Code § 17200 when
they engaged in unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business acts, practices and/or
tactics, by conspiring to and jointly engaging in a scheme to defraud banks
to overvalue their property and attempting to give their business an
unfair financial advantage over other businesses and harming the public.
Furthermore, Cross-Defendants, ANTERJEET KAUR, BALKAR S. DEOL, BM FREIGHT INC.,
and PARMINDER SINGH tried to enlist Cross-Complainant HANIF DAUD in this
scheme, and when he declined to partake, Cross-Defendants wrongfully accused
him of failing to fulfill his contractual obligations. (CC ¶52.) 
 
Effectively, the purported unlawful business activity is defrauding
banks.[5]

 
Here, as noted by Plaintiff, the scheme alleged is to the
detriment of third parties, not the Engineers. Thus, absent an injury in fact, the Engineers do not have
standing to assert this COA. (See Demurrer p. 7, citing L. Offs. of
Mathew Higbee v. Expungement Assistance Servs. (2013) 214 Cal. App. 4th
544, 552. Thus, the demurrer is sustained. 
 
As for leave to amend, though the
COA likely will fail as a matter of law because the Engineers have not alleged
lost money or property,[6]
the court grants leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the
demurrer to the CC is sustained with leave to amend.
