Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court denies Carrien's motion to pay her own legal fees and costs from the company's funds. The court finds that none of the three purported methods of indemnification (the company handbook, the Corporations Code, and the shareholders agreement) apply to the facts of this case. The court concludes that Carrien has not met the required standard for indemnification, as Jay has made a showing of bad faith and/or intentional wrongdoing. The court also finds that the company's funds have been misused, with large sums of money disappearing from the company's bank account without explanation. As a result, the court denies the motion for attorney fees and costs.
