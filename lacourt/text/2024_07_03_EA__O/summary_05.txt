And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a dispute between the plaintiff, BALKAR S. DEOL and BM FREIGHT, INC., and the defendants, LAKSHMI KAPOOR, INVESTORS TEAM REALTY, INC., HANIF DAUD, SAMAN MAHMOOD, and ICON ATELIER INC. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants made false representations about a vacant commercial property and engaged in a scheme to defraud banks.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the cross-complaint filed by the defendants, which alleged a cause of action for Unfair Competition. The judge has ruled that the defendants, who are engineers, do not have standing to assert this cause of action because they have not alleged an injury in fact.

The judge has granted leave to amend the cross-complaint, allowing the defendants to re-file their complaint with a new reservation ID. The case will proceed to a hearing on July 3, 2024, where the judge will finalize the ruling.
