[1] The factual and
procedural background have been shortened. 


[2] In Reply, Jay argues
that (i) Employee Handbook was never approved by Jay nor has he ever been
provided a copy of the Employee Handbook; (ii) Handbook is contrary to public
policy and unenforceable because it shifts the cost and burden entirely onto
Jay; and (iii) Jay has never been granted company funds to use for his own
defense of litigation invoked by Carrien in this action. (Reply p. 3.) However,
none squarely address whether the Handbook applies. 


[3] Pursuant to
subdivision (d), indemnification is mandatory if the officer was “successful on the merits” in
defense of a proceeding arising out of their performance of corporate duties.
The phrase “successful on the merits” means that there has been a judicial
determination of the actual merits of the defense raised; settlements and
dismissal are insufficient. (See American Nat’l Bank & Trust Co. v.
Schigur (1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 790, 793.) For this reason, it is unclear why company funds were
used to pay for the settlement in the 19PSCV00181 case. (See Opp. p. 8:
8-12.) Here, as conceded by Plaintiff, mandatory indemnification is irrelevant
as there has yet been no determination on the merits. (Opp. p. 9:8-9.)  


[4] Though Carrien
relies upon the Fed-Mart Corp. case, it is not an instructive case as
the reasons why the trial court reached its determination are not
provided. Instead, the case largely focuses on the actual and reasonable
expenses incurred for attorney fees, which is not at issue with this motion. But
the case does provide that the trial court's
factual findings, express or implied, must be upheld if supported by
substantial evidence. (Id. at p. 221.) 
            


[5] And as for the
attorney fees, Jay contends that prior Counsel Damon Mircheff told Judge Falls
that company funds used to fund Carrien’s attorney were improper. (Motion p. 6
of 47:16-19.)
