[1] Investors is being
sued on a vicarious liability theory. (First Amended Complaint (FAC) ¶4.)


[2] Though Plaintiff is
now also a cross-defendant, for clarity purposes, the court will address the
parties as defined in the court’s ‘background’ section. 
 


[3] The court presumes
that Plaintiff took the motion off calendar because of improper notice.
According to the opposition to the initial demurrer, the demurrer was required
to be served by May 3, 2024 but it was untimely served on May 7. 
 


[4] The parties have met
and conferred. 


[5] Plaintiff
(conclusively) argues that no business
practice has been alleged. Not necessarily. The “unfair” standard is intentionally broad, allowing courts maximum
discretion to prohibit new schemes to defraud. (Motors, Inc. v. Times Mirror
Co. (1980) 102 Cal.3d 735, 740.) And Plaintiff has not set forth an
analysis as to why the alleged scheme does not fall under the purview of the
UCL. The fact that Plaintiff
alleges that Plaintiff was the victim of the Engineer’s purported
fraudulent scheme is irrelevant to the allegations found within the CC.

v. Sup. Court (2011) 51 Cal.4th 310.
