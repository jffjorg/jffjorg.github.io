And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Carrien v. Jay. The case revolves around the Employee Handbook, which Jay argues was never approved by him and has never been provided a copy of. Jay also contends that the Handbook is contrary to public policy and unenforceable because it shifts the cost and burden entirely onto him. Additionally, Jay claims that he was not granted company funds to use for his own defense of litigation invoked by Carrien in this action.

The Judge notes that the Employee Handbook is relevant to the issue of indemnification, which is mandatory if the officer was "successful on the merits" in defense of a proceeding arising out of their performance of corporate duties. However, the Judge points out that this provision is unclear in this case because there has yet been no determination on the merits.

The Judge also addresses the issue of attorney fees, noting that while the Fed-Mart Corp. case is not instructive on the issue of indemnification, it does provide that the trial court's factual findings must be upheld if supported by substantial evidence. The Judge concludes that mandatory indemnification is irrelevant in this case because there has been no determination on the merits.

The Judge's tentative ruling suggests that the court will need to make a determination on the merits of the defense before indemnification can be granted, and that the trial court's factual findings must be upheld if supported by substantial evidence.
