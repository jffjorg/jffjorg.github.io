And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion to compel further discovery filed by Plaintiff Nasser Sedaghat and the responses from the Defendants, Tarzana Health and Rehabilitation Center and Kamran Kamrava. The Plaintiff has propounded multiple sets of discovery requests, including special interrogatories and requests for production of documents, and has filed a motion to compel further discovery. The court has denied the motion due to several reasons, including the fact that the motion includes multiple sets of discovery requests, lacks a separate statement, and does not show a reasonable and good faith attempt at informal resolution. The court has also denied the Plaintiff's request for sanctions, as the motion was deficient and the Defendants' opposition was substantially justified. The court orders that the Defendants shall give notice of the ruling.
