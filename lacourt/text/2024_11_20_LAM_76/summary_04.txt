And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay the litigation. The plaintiff alleges that she was terminated for complaining about illegal practices in her employment, including illegal evictions, wage and hour violations, and racial discrimination in security deposit requirements. The defendants moved to compel arbitration and stay the litigation, citing arbitration agreements signed by the plaintiff on November 30, 2021 and December 1, 2021.

The judge found that the arbitration agreements are enforceable and that the plaintiff agreed to submit all of the claims asserted in her complaint to mandatory arbitration. The judge also found that the arbitration agreement satisfies the minimum requirements set out in Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc., including the provision of neutral arbitrators, adequate discovery, a written award, and the employer's payment of arbitration costs.

The judge set a status conference for April 18, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. to determine the status of the arbitration. The plaintiff has 30 days from the date of the status conference to file her response to the motion to compel arbitration.
