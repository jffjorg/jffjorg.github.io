Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the ex parte application for a temporary restraining order (TRO) filed by Robynn Samuel, the petitioner, against Marlin D. Samuel, the respondent. The petition seeks to prevent the respondent from accessing a joint business account at Bank of America. The judge finds that the application does not comply with the procedural requirements for ex parte applications, including the failure to provide a proposed order setting forth the relief requested and the lack of a declaration of notice indicating that a person answered the phone. Additionally, the judge finds that the petitioner has not established a substantive basis for a TRO, as there is no specific evidence showing that the respondent's use of the account will result in actual harm to the petitioner. The judge notes that the petition is based on generalized, nonspecific issues and that the high standard for issuance of a TRO is not met.
