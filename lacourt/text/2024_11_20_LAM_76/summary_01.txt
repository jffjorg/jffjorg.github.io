And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to demur to a cross-complaint. The cross-complaint alleges breach of contract, breach of oral contract, open book account, account stated, quantum meruit, fraud, and receipt of stolen property. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action (breach of written contract) without leave to amend, as the plaintiff did not attach a copy of the contract or plead the terms of the contract in haec verba. The judge has overruled the demurrer to the second cause of action (breach of oral contract) as the plaintiff did not demur to it. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the sixth cause of action (fraud) without leave to amend, as the plaintiff did not plead the fraud with sufficient specificity. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the seventh cause of action (receipt of stolen property) without leave to amend, as the property in question was the plaintiff's own property.

The judge has granted the motion to strike certain paragraphs of the cross-complaint, including paragraphs 19, 34, and 40, which alleged amounts due and owing, and paragraph 72, which alleged a total amount due. The judge has also struck certain invoices attached to the cross-complaint as time-barred.

The plaintiff is ordered to answer the remaining allegations of the cross-complaint within 10 days.
