reflects that Cross-Defendant’s counsel satisfied the meet and confer

Discussion
            Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
Tim Pappas demurs to the First Amended Cross-Complaint as follows:
1.         First Cause of action (Breach of
Written Contract).
            Cross-Defendant argues that the First
Amended Cross-Complaint (1ACC) does not attach a copy of the contract, plead
the terms of the contract in haec verba, or expressly allege the substance
of the material terms.
Although older case law states that “[i]f the action is based
on an alleged breach of a written contract, the terms must be set out verbatim
in the body of the complaint or a copy of the written instrument must be
attached and incorporated by reference.” 
(Otworth v.
Southern Pac. Transportation Co. (1985) 166 Cal. App. 3d 452, 458-459), the
modern view is to permit a plaintiff to plead the legal effect of a written
contract rather than its precise language:
The Wise court stated, “where a written instrument is the foundation of
a cause of action, it may be pleaded in haec verba by attaching a copy as an
exhibit and incorporating it by proper reference.” (Citation omitted.) It is
readily apparent that the Otworth court read more into that statement than is
actually there. The Wise court was simply stating one available method of
pleading the contract—it was not specifying the exclusive means of pleading a
contract. The correct rule is that “a plaintiff may plead the legal effect of
the contract rather than its precise language.” (Citation omitted.) Because it
is apparent that the Otworth court misread Wise , and because, in any
event, we are bound by our Supreme Court, we decline to follow Otworth.
Accordingly, plaintiff's failure either to attach or to set out verbatim the
terms of the contract was not fatal to his breach of contract cause of action.


(Miles v.
Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 394, 402.)
            ¶ 21 of the 1ACC alleges that the
agreements were memorialized in writing, and attached as Exhibit A. These
invoices are unsigned, and thus cannot constitute written contracts.
Unsigned invoices, however, cannot on
their own create a contract or add terms to a contract. “The prevailing rule is
that an invoice, standing alone, is not a contract [citations]; and a buyer is
ordinarily not bound by statements thereon which are not a part of the original
agreement.” (Citation omitted.) “After the orders were placed the seller
transmitted certain invoices on which it attempted to place certain additional
covenants into the contract. Such additions were mere self-serving declarations
on the part of the seller and were not binding on the purchasers.” (Citation
omitted.) “An invoice, as such, is no contract.” (Citation omitted.)


(C9 Ventures v. SVC-West, L.P. (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1483, 1501.)
23. The terms were as follows: 
 
1. 1995 Porsche GT2 993 - Initially a complete exterior and
interior ground up restoration per original estimate. Later there were added
upgrades to suspension, engine, and brake system. The labor bill rates agreed
to were $125/$75. Parts and materials were billed at cost plus 
markup. Total billed for this car was $510,312.92, well within the cost
estimates negotiated and agreed to by the parties. ($237,941.95 remains due on
the account for this work.) 
 
2. 1987 RUF CTR Yellowbird - Engine upgrades, transaxle repairs,
body/paint restoration, interior upgrades, new tires, and restoration detail.
The labor bill rates agreed to were $135/$75. Parts and materials were billed
at cost plus markup. The total billed for this car was $169,030.69 well within
the cost estimates negotiated and agreed to by the parties. 
($141,399.57 remains due on the account for this work.)
 
3. 1988 Porsche 959SC - Extensive upgrades including engine
performance, brake system upgrade, audio system upgrade, interior lighting
upgrade and new Porsche 959SC 18” wheel and tire package. The labor bill rates
agreed to were $140/$75. Parts and materials were billed at cost plus markup.
The total billed for this car was $174,960.16 well within the cost estimates
negotiated and agreed to by the parties. (75,960.16 remains due on the account
for this work.) 
 
(1ACC, ¶ 23.)
            These appear to simply be historical
summaries without any reference to the documents in which they were embodied. To
the extent the unsigned invoices were the embodiment of the terms, as discussed
above, they do not constitute written contracts.
            This cause of action is not
adequately pled, and it appears that Cross-Complainant will not be able to cite
any written contracts.
            The demurrer to the first cause of
action is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
2.         Second
Cause of Action (Breach of Oral Contract)
            This cause of action was contained
in the original Cross-Complaint, but Cross-Defendant did not demur to it. In
this regard, Civ. Proc. Code, § 430.41(b) states:
(b)A party demurring to a pleading that has been amended after a demurrer to
an earlier version of the pleading was sustained shall not demur to any portion
of the amended complaint, cross-complaint, or answer on grounds that could have
been raised by demurrer to the earlier version of the complaint,
cross-complaint, or answer.

     (Civ. Proc. Code, § 430.41(b).)
            As such, Cross-Defendant
may not demur to the second cause of action. The demurrer to the second cause
of action is OVERRULED.
3.         Third Cause of Action (Open Book
Account).
            This cause of action was not
asserted in the original Cross-Complaint, so Cross-Defendant may demur to it
now.
           However, Cross-Defendant’s argument
is that, because the second cause of action is barred in part by the statute of
limitations, this cause of action may not be used to avoid the limitations
period. Because this argument is derivative of the second cause of action
argument, as to which Cross-Defendant may not demur per Civ. Proc. Code, §
430.41(b), the demurrer fails.
            The demurrer to the third cause of
action is OVERRULED.
4.         Fourth Cause of Action (Account
Stated).
            This cause of action was contained
in the original Cross-Complaint, but Cross-Defendant did not demur to it. As
such, Cross-Defendant may not demurrer to the second cause of action. (Civ.
Proc. Code, § 430.41(b).) The demurrer to the fourth cause of action is
OVERRULED.
5.         Fifth Cause of Action (Quantum
Meruit / Goods & Services Delivered).
            This cause of action was contained
in the original Cross-Complaint, but Cross-Defendant did not demur to it. As
such, Cross-Defendant may not demurrer to the second cause of action. (Civ.
Proc. Code, § 430.41(b).) The demurrer to the fifth cause of action is
OVERRULED.
6.         Sixth Cause of Action (Fraud).
            Cross-Defendant argues that this
cause of action is not pled with the requisite specificity.
            Moreover, Cross-Defendant argues,
the specific allegations regarding what Pappas said in July 2021, occurred
after the work had already been performed prior to July 2021.
            The
elements of a cause of action for a false promise constituting fraud or deceit
are: “(1) a promise made regarding a material fact without any intention of
performing it; (2) the existence of the intent at the time of making the
promise; (3) the promise was made with intent to deceive or with intent to
induce the party to whom it was made to enter into the transaction; (4) the
promise was relied on by the party to whom it was made; (5) the party making
the promise did not perform; (6) the party to whom the promise was made was
injured.” (Regus v. Schartkoff (1957) 156 Cal.App.2d 382, 389.)
          As stated in Service By Medallion v. Clorox Co. (1996) 44
Cal.App.4th 1807, 1816:
 
"An action for promissory fraud may lie
where a defendant fraudulently induces the plaintiff to enter into a
contract." (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal. 4th 631, 638 [49 Cal.
Rptr. 2d 377, 909 P.2d 981].) The action is one of deceit, which requires proof
that the defendant made a misrepresentation of fact or a promise without any
intention of performing it. (Civ. Code, § 1710.) A complaint for fraud must
allege the following elements: (1) a knowingly false representation by the
defendant; (2) an intent to deceive or induce reliance; (3) justifiable
reliance by the plaintiff; and (4) resulting damages. (Croeni v. Goldstein
(1994) 21 Cal. Cal. App. 4th 754, 758 [26 Cal. Rptr. 2d 412].) Every element
must be specifically pleaded. (Tarmann v. State Farm  Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.
(1991) 2 Cal. Cal. App. 4th 153, 157 [2 Cal. Rptr. 2d 861].)
            “Consequently,
in pleading the tort it is indispensable to set forth the falsity of the
promise at the time it was tendered. (Citation omitted.) In so differentiating
a false promise from the great bulk of broken promises, the allegations
necessary to show contemporaneous intention not to perform should be clear,
specific, and unequivocal. (Citations omitted.)” (Hills Transp. Co. v. Southwest Forest Industries, Inc. (1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 702, 708.)
            “The
mere failure to carry out a promise is not a tort, and it is therefore
essential, in pleading fraud consisting of a false promise, to allege the
elements of fraud.” (Maynes v.
Angeles Mesa Land Co. (1938)
10 Cal.2d 587, 589.)
Fraud must be pleaded with specificity rather than with “ ‘general and
conclusory allegations.’ ” (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th
167, 184 [132 Cal. Rptr. 2d 490, 65 P.3d 1255].)  The specificity
requirement means a plaintiff must allege facts showing how, when, where, to
whom, and by what means the representations were made, and, in the case of a
corporate defendant, the plaintiff must allege the names of the persons who
made the representations, their authority to speak on behalf of the corporation,
to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when the representation was
made. (Lazar v. Superior Court, supra, 12 Cal.4th at p. 645.)
 
We enforce the specificity requirement in consideration of its two
purposes. The first purpose is to give notice to the defendant with
sufficiently definite charges that the defendant can meet them. (Committee on
Children's Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 216
[197 Cal. Rptr. 783, 673 P.2d 660].) The second is to permit a court to weed
out meritless fraud claims on the basis of the pleadings; thus, “the pleading
should be sufficient ‘ “to enable the court to determine whether, on the facts
pleaded, there is any foundation, prima facie at least, for the charge of
fraud.” ’ ” (Id. at pp. 216–217.)
(West v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
(2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 793.)
Here, the 1ACC alleges in general terms that Pappas agreed to timely pay
for all work invoiced by Canepa Group. (1ACC, ¶ 47). The 1ACC does not allege
exactly what Pappas said, when and in what matter (orally or in writing), and
why such representation was known to be false when made. Moreover, the 1ACC
does not allege that such representations were made before Cross-Complainant
performed services.
The allegation that Pappas misrepresented his intention on July 14, 2021 to
have Canepa Group perform future work in order to obtain possession of the
Porsche to have a third party perform interim mechanical work could constitute
actionable fraud, but it is not pled with sufficient specificity, as the exact
misrepresentation is not specifically pled. (1ACC, ¶¶ 48, 49, 50.)[1]
Cross-Complainant was given an opportunity to plead fraud with
specificity but failed to do so. As such, the demurrer to the sixth cause of
action is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
7          Seventh Cause of Action (Receipt of
Stolen Property).
            Cross-Defendant
argues that this is a garden-variety civil dispute which does not violate Penal
Code, § 496. First, the 1995 Porshe was Pappas’ own car, not the property of
another. Second, the fraud claim fails, so the property was not obtained by
defrauding Canepa Group.
            Penal
Code § 496
provides in pertinent part:
(a) Every person who buys or receives any property that has
been stolen or that has been obtained in any manner constituting theft or
extortion, knowing the property to be so stolen or obtained, or who
conceals, sells, withholds, or aids in concealing, selling, or withholding any
property from the owner, knowing the property to be so stolen or obtained,
shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year,
or imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170. However, if the value
of the property does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950), the offense
shall be a misdemeanor, punishable only by imprisonment in a county jail not
exceeding one year, if such person has no prior convictions for an offense
specified in clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision
(e) of Section 667 or for an offense requiring registration pursuant to
subdivision (c) of Section 290.
 
 A principal in the actual theft of the property may be convicted
pursuant to this section. However, no person may be convicted both pursuant to
this section and of the theft of the same property.
 
. . .
 
(c) Any person who has been injured by a violation of subdivision
(a) or (b) may bring an action for three times the amount of actual damages, if
any, sustained by the plaintiff, costs of suit, and reasonable attorney's fees.
            The Court
finds to be persuasive Cross-Defendant’s argument that he cannot violate Penal
Code, § 496 for taking his own property. At most, he took his own property
subject to a mechanic’s lien, but this does not violate § 496. However,
Cross-Defendant can violate § 496 by obtaining labor by false or fraudulent
representation, which constitutes theft.
            Penal Code,
§ 484(a) defines theft as follows:
(a) Every person who shall
feloniously steal, take, carry, lead, or drive away the personal property of
another, or who shall fraudulently appropriate property which has been
entrusted to him or her, or who shall knowingly and designedly, by any false
or fraudulent representation or pretense, defraud any other person of money,
labor or real or personal property, . . ., is guilty of theft. . . . For
the purposes of this section, any false or fraudulent representation or
pretense made shall be treated as continuing, so as to cover any money,
property or service received as a result thereof, and the complaint,
information or indictment may charge that the crime was committed on any date
during the particular period in question. The hiring of any additional employee
or employees without advising each of them of every labor claim due and unpaid
and every judgment that the employer has been unable to meet shall be prima
facie evidence of intent to defraud.

     (Pen.
Code § 484(a)[bold emphasis added].)
            However, Cross-Complainant was given
an opportunity to sufficiently plead fraud upon which Cross-Complainant relied
in performing services. As discussed above, this pleading standard was not met.
            As such, the
demurrer to the seventh cause of action is SUSTAINED without leave to
amend.
Motion To Strike
Meet and Confer
The Declaration of Matthew E. Hess
reflects that Cross-Defendant’s counsel satisfied the meet and confer
requirement set forth in Civ. Proc. Code, § 435.5.
Discussion
            Cross-Defendant
moves to strike the entire First Amended Cross-Complaint because it is a sham
pleading. This request is DENIED as unpersuasive as to the entire 1AC.
            The
sham pleading doctrine is discretionary:
[U]nder the sham pleading doctrine, the trial court may
disregard amendments that omit harmful allegations in the original complaint or
add allegations inconsistent with it. (Citations
omitted.)
(Falcon v. Long Beach Genetics, Inc. (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1263,
1281 [bold emphasis added].)
            Cross-Defendant
also moves to strike the following portions of the First Amended
Cross-Complaint
 

 ¶ 19 – “there is currently a balance due…
     in the amount of about $469,282.40.” 

 
GRANTED in part without leave
to amend. $453,076.94 is ordered stricken as time-barred. See below.
 

 ¶ 34 – “there is now due, owing and
     unpaid the sum of $469,282.40….” 

 
GRANTED in part without leave
to amend. $453,076.94 is ordered stricken as time-barred. See below.
 

¶ 40 –
     “defendants are indebted to Cross-Complainant in the sum of  $469,282.40…” 

 
GRANTED in part without leave
to amend. $453,076.94 is ordered stricken as time-barred. See below.
 

¶ 72 –
     “a total of at least $1,400,000…” 
GRANTED in part without leave
to amend. $1,359,230.85 (3 x $453,076.94) is ordered stricken as time-barred. See
below. 

The
     following invoices attached at Exhibit A to the Cross-Complaint: Nos.
     36102 

(3/12/18, $164,595.34), 36293 (6/21/18, $107,775.63), 38539
(2/27/00 
$169,030.69) and 41079 (9/10/19, $11,675.29).
GRANTED without
leave to amend.
            As
discussed above re: the demurrer, unsigned invoices do not themselves
constitute written contracts and, at most, memorialize oral or implied-in-fact
contracts, which this Court previously ruled are subject to the two-year
statute of limitations set forth in Civ. Proc. Code, § 339(1)(action upon a
contract, obligation or liability not founded upon an instrument of writing).
As such, the amounts reflected in the above invoices are time-barred, as pled.
            Cross-Defendant
is to answer the remaining allegations of the First Amended Cross-Complaint
within 10 days.
