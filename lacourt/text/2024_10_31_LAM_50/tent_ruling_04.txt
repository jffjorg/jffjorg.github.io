[1]The first, second,
and fourth causes of action are alleged against “all Defendants.” The third
cause of action is alleged against David A. Alessi. On February 21, 2023,
Siegel filed a request for dismissal of the third cause of action of the SAC. Dismissal
was entered on February 22, 2023. 
 


[2]The Court notes
that the opposition does not clearly state which party filed the opposition.
However, the caption page of the opposition states “Attorneys for Robert A.
Koenig.” Thus, the Court construes the opposition as filed by Koenig. 


[3]The Court notes
that Siegel’s exhibits appear to be numbered incorrectly. The exhibits do not
appear to be numbered as referenced in the Declaration of James Ellis Arden. 


[4]In the SAC, Siegel
alleges that “[o]n January 4, 2017, judgment was entered against plaintiff,”
and that “[o]n April 13, 2017, as plaintiff was leaving his home, a stranger
walked up and told plaintiff that plaintiff’s house had been auctioned off that
morning...” (SAC, ¶ 28, 32.)


[5]As discussed, the
SAC alleges that defendants “refused plaintiff’s several requests that they
file a motion for relief on plaintiff’s behalf under Code
of Civil Procedure section 473, so that plaintiff could have a chance to
contest the unlawful detainer action…” (SAC, ¶ 45.)


[6]Siegel’s use of
the word “with” appears to be a typo.
