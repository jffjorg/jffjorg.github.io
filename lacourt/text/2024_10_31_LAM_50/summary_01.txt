And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's unopposed motion to continue the trial and all trial-related dates. The current trial date is set for December 4, 2024, but the judge finds that good cause exists for a continuance. The defendant's counsel substituted in the case in September 2024, and the trial will not be able to be completed within the three court days of December 4-6, 2024 due to Department 50 being dark from December 10, 2024 to the end of the year. The new trial date will be set at a later time, and all discovery and motion deadlines will be based on the new trial date.
