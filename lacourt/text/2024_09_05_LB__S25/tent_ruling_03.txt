 Case Number:  24LBCV00239    Hearing Date:   September 5, 2024    Dept:  S25 Procedural BackgroundPlaintiff filed his complaint against Defendants Roseann De Luca and Does 1 through 20 on February 6, 2024. On March 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed an first amended complaint (“FAC”). On May 21, 2024, the Court overruled the Defendant’s Demurrer as to the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 5th causes of action in the FAC and sustained with leave to amend as to 2nd cause of action; the Court also granted in part Defendant’s request to strike portions of the FAC. (May 21, 2024 Minute Order.) On June 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint (“SAC”), alleging the following causes of action:1. Violation of Cal. Code. Regs. tit. 2 § 12176;2. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress;3. Violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act;4. Disability Discrimination – Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodation; and5. Disability Discrimination – Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process.On or about October 5, 2023, Plaintiff Albert Simic (“Plaintiff”) responded to a rental advertisement on Zillow.com for an apartment located on 1337 South Gaffey Street #8, San Pedro, CA 90731. (SAC ¶ 17.) Defendant Roseann Rosman (“Defendant”) was the owner and property manager for the apartment. (SAC ¶ 18.) On October 6, 20023, Defendant responded to Plaintiff’s inquiry and informed Plaintiff of her no pets and no smoking policy. (SAC ¶ 19.) The following day, Plaintiff view the apartment alone. Subsequently, during a phone call, Plaintiff allegedly informed Defendant of his emotional support animal. (SAC ¶ 20.) On October 9, 2023, Defendant emailed the rental application to Plaintiff. In the email, Defendant stated “Please know I do NOT accept pets or other occupants other than you.” (SAC ¶ 21.) That same day, Plaintiff submitted a rental application and indicated to Defendant his difficulties in obtaining an extended credit report as required by Defendant. These difficulties were communicated to Defendant and Plaintiff offered to reimburse Defendant of any costs associated with obtaining an extended credit report. Defendant insisted on an extended credit report to allegedly obtain criminal background check on Plaintiff; Plaintiff ultimately obtained the extended credit report and provided the document to Defendant. Defendant acknowledged receipt of the extended report. (SAC ¶¶ 22-26.) In the evening of October 9, Defendant informed Plaintiff that a relative needed the apartment and asked Plaintiff to “wait.” The next day, using a “disguised” email address, Plaintiff contacted Defendant to ask if the apartment was available; Defendant responded that the apartment was available. Further, on or about November 5, Plaintiff received a Zillow notification that the apartment remained available, and the rental amount was reduced. (SAC ¶¶ 27-28.) Consequently, Plaintiff claims Defendant would not rent the apartment to him because of Plaintiff’s emotional support animal. In late November, Plaintiff informed Defendant of the “perceived discrimination” to which Defendant responded she “did not owe him any explanations” and was allegedly advised against creating unnecessary stress. (SAC ¶ 30.)On July 5, 2024, Defendant filed the instant demurrer with motion to strike. On August 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On August 28, 2024, Defendant filed a reply.Meet and ConferThe requirements are satisfied. Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).Request for Judicial NoticePlaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice of Exhibit 1 is granted.Defendant’s Request for Judicial Notice of Exhibits 1-4 is granted.Tentative RulingPursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 430.1, Defendant demurs to the 1st through 5th causes of action on the ground that each cause of action is not sufficiently pleaded. Defendant also challenges the FAC on the grounds there are inconsistent allegations that violate the “sham pleading” doctrine.Sham Pleading DoctrineRegarding the same pleading doctrine, “[t]he general rule … is that material factual allegations in a verified pleading that are omitted in a subsequent amended pleading without adequate explanation will be considered by the court in ruling on a demurrer to the later pleading.” (Shoemaker v. Myers (1990) 52 Cal.3d 1, 12-13.) Although a court generally must take the allegations in a complaint as true when ruling on a demurrer, “an exception exists where a party files an amended complaint and seeks to avoid the defects of a prior complaint either by omitting the facts that rendered the complaint defective or by pleading facts inconsistent with the allegations of prior pleadings.” (Owens v. KingsSupermarket (1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 379, 383-384.) “In these circumstances, the policy against sham pleading permits the court to take judicial notice of the prior pleadings and requires that the pleader explain the inconsistency. If he fails to do so the court may disregard the inconsistent allegations and read into the amended complaint the allegations of the superseded complaint.” (Id.) “The exception is reserved, however, for the extreme case, and it may not be indiscriminately applied; it ‘must be taken together with its purpose, which is to prevent amended pleading which is only a sham, when it is apparent that no cause of action can be stated truthfully.’ [Citations.]” (Amarel v. Connell (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 137, 144.)Plaintiff previously alleged that Plaintiff’s ESA was a “dog” but now pleads in the SAC that Plaintiff’s ESA is a “cat”. Unlike in Amid v. Hawthorne Community Medical Group, Inc. (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 1383, 1384-1385, wherein plaintiff in the fourth amended complaint alleged a sham allegation of an express oral nondisclosure agreement after the trial court properly sustained the defendant’s demurrer to the physician’s cause of action for intentional breach of confidential relationship on the ground that the plaintiff alleged no basis for a confidential relationship, and Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 751, wherein the omission of alternate allegation that defendant did not tell plaintiff she did not have breast cancer alleged in the second amended complaint did not render the third amended complaint a sham pleading vulnerable to demurrer in the plaintiff’s action against physicians for negligence and fraudulent concealment, here, the change of the ESA from the “dog” to “cat” does not materially alter the fundamental nature of the claims asserted. The Court finds Defendant’s “sham pleading” argument unpersuasive and the demurrer to the entire complaint is OVERRULED on that ground.1st Cause of Action – Violation of Cal. Code. Regs. Title 2 § 12176An individual with a disability seeking reasonable accommodation or modification must make a request for such accommodation or modification. (See CCR 2 § 12176, subd. (f)(1)). “A request for a reasonable accommodation or modification need not be made in a particular manner or at a particular time. An individual makes a reasonable accommodation or modification request at the time they request orally or in writing… because of a disability, regardless of whether the phrase “reasonable accommodation” or “reasonable modification” is used as part of the request. A request for a reasonable accommodation or reasonable modification may be made at any time, including during the inquiry or application process….” (CCR 2, § 12176 subd.(f)(1)(3).The Court recognizes that case law is unclear whether a defendant may properly demur to an amended complaint on grounds overruled in a prior demurrer. (See Bennett v. Suncloud (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 91, 96-97 [holding that a trial judge was “foreclosed from rendering a new determination on the viability of” causes of action which had been the subject of a previous demurrer on the same grounds where the demurrer had beenoverruled, “unless some new facts or circumstances were brought to his attention.”]; contra, Carlton v. Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 1200, 1211 [plaintiff’s filing of a second amended complaint permitted renewed demurrer to entire complaint despite prior unsuccessful demurrer to same cause of action]; Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2024) ¶¶ 7:140-7:142.)As stated above, Defendant’s argument that Plaintiff’s new allegation that he has a cat as an ESA does not substantially change the allegations as to the first cause of action. As Plaintiff points out, the Court previously overruled Defendant’s demurrer to the FAC on May 21, 2024, finding that sufficient facts have been pled. (RJN ¶ 1 [May 21, 2024 Minute Order].) Because Defendant has not demonstrated that any of Plaintiff’s earlier allegations set forth in the FAC has been omitted or changed in the SAC, aside from the ESA fact, the demurrer as to the 1st cause of action is OVERRULED.2nd Cause of Action – Intentional Infliction of Emotional DistressIIED occurs under conditions where there is: (1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff’s suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendant's outrageous conduct. (Hughes v. Pair (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1035, 1050.) A defendant's conduct is “outrageous” when it is so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community. And the defendant's conduct must be intended to inflict injury or engaged in with the realization that injury will result. (Ibid.)Here, Plaintiff has added new allegations as to Defendant’s refusal to accommodate Plaintiff’s disability and need for an Emotional Support Animal (“ESA”), despite Plaintiff’s explicit notification of his need, and Defendant’s subsequent acts of misleading Plaintiff about the apartment’s availability. (See SAC ¶¶ 40-43.) While alleged communications between the parties could be described as “untrue,” “deceitful” “evasive,” Defendant’s alleged conduct does not rise to the level of “extreme and outrageous” conduct that exceeds all bounds tolerated in a civilized society. Based upon the facts previously alleged and Plaintiff’s opposition, it does not appear that Plaintiff can cure this defect. The demurrer is sustained WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND to the 2nd cause of action.3rd Cause of Action – Violation of the Unruh Civil Rights ActDefendant’s argument that Plaintiff’s new allegation that he has a cat as an ESA does not substantially change the allegations as to the first cause of action. As Plaintiff points out, the Court previously overruled Defendant’s demurrer to the FAC on May 21, 2024, finding that sufficient facts have been pled. (RJN ¶ 1 [May 21, 2024 Minute Order].) Moreover, the Unruh Civil Rights Act applies to businesses engaged in the selling orleasing of residential housing, including owners, property managers, developers, and real estate brokers. (CCR 2 § 12005, subd. (f); see Marina Point, Ltd. v. Wolfson (1982) 30 Cal. 3d 721, 730-731; O'Connor v. Village Green Owners Association (1983) 33 Cal.3d 790, 794-795.) The demurrer as to the 3rd cause of action is OVERRULED.4th and 5th Causes of Action – Disability Discrimination: Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodation and Disability Discrimination: Failure to Engage in the Interactive ProcessPlaintiff’s new allegation that he has a cat as an ESA does not substantially change the allegations as to the first cause of action. As Plaintiff points out, the Court previously overruled Defendant’s demurrer to the FAC on May 21, 2024, finding that sufficient facts have been pled. (RJN ¶ 1 [May 21, 2024 Minute Order].) Because Defendant has not demonstrated that any of Plaintiff’s earlier allegations set forth in the FAC has been omitted or changed in the SAC, aside from the ESA fact, the demurrer is OVERRULED as to the 4th and 5th causes of action.Motion to StrikeDefendant requests the Court strike the following portions from the SAC:1.
