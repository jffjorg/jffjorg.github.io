 Case Number:  23LBCV02502    Hearing Date:   September 5, 2024    Dept:  S25 Procedural BackgroundOn January 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants Old Navy, LLC (“Old Navy”), GAP, LLC (“GAP”) and Does 1 to 20, alleging the following causes of action:1. Discrimination on the Basis of Disability [Gov. Code §§ 12940 (a)];2. Disability Discrimination – Reasonable Accommodation – Failure to Engage in Good Faith Interactive Process [GOV. CODE § 12940(n)];3. Disability Discrimination – Failure to Make Reasonable Accommodation [Gov. Code § 12940(m)(1)];4. Retaliation on the Basis of Request for Accommodation [Gov. Code § 12940(m) (2)]; and5. Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy.Plaintiff alleges that she was hired by Old Navy on July 6, 2016 and was employed by Old Navy for over 7 years until her termination on July 14, 2023, also alleging that she believes Old Navy and GAP to be her co-employers. (Compl., ¶¶ 11, 12.) Plaintiff further alleges that she was diagnosed with anxiety and depression and that in March of 2023, Old Navy learned of Plaintiff’s anxiety issues. (Compl., ¶¶ 13-14.) Plaintiff then alleges that in May of 2023, she experienced anxiety issues at work. (Compl., ¶ 15.) After Plaintiff had an anxiety attack on June 6, 2023 in her car that was observed by one of Plaintiff’s co-workers, Plaintiff was not allowed to return to work until she reached out to one of Old Navy’s online counselors for therapy; eventually, Plaintiff was terminated on July 14, 2023 because she violated company police when she went outside during her anxiety attack. (Compl., ¶¶ 16-22.) On February 20, 2024, Defendant Old Navy, LLC filed an answer. That same day, Defendant GAP, Inc. (erroneously sued and served as GAP, LLC) filed an answer.On August 9, 2024, Defendant Old Navy filed the instant motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Defendant Old Navy’s Requests for Production (Set One). On August 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a response stating she does not oppose the instant motion.Legal StandardIf a party to whom document demands are directed fails to respond at all, the propounding party’s remedy is to seek a court order compelling answers thereto. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) All that needs to be shown is that the discovery was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. The moving party is not required to show a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the matter informally before filing this motion. A motion to compel initial discovery responses need not show good cause, meeting and conferring, or timely filing, and need not be accompanied by a separate statement. (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) The failure to timely respond also waives all objections.¿¿On motion, a party may be relieved from its waiver of objections if: (1) the party subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance “with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280” and (2) “[t]he party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a)(1)-(2).)Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (c), provides that, "[t]he court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust." Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010, subd. (d), provides that a misuse of the discovery process is failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010, subd. (h), states that a misuse of the discovery process includes making or opposing, unsuccessfully and without substantial justification, a motion to compel or limit discovery. A court may impose a monetary sanction against a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process or any attorney advising such conduct under Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a). A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771.)AnalysisIn its motion, Defendant Old Navy provides that Requests for Production of Documents (Set One) was propounded on Plaintiff on March 29, 2024. (Deyoung Decl., ¶ 2.) Plaintiff’s responses were due April 28, 2024 and the parties agreed to extend the deadline to respond to July 8, 2024; however, Plaintiff’s counsel still failed to serve any response to all of the Requests for Production of Documents except Request No. 28. (Deyoung Decl., ¶¶ 2-5.) Defendant Old Navy argues for Plaintiff to provide objection-less responses to Defendant Old Navy’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One.Plaintiff filed a response stating that she does not oppose the instant motion. Plaintiff counsel asserts that he has been unable to provide responses as of this date because he was engaged in trial for another case entitled, Danny Salas v. Smart & Final Stores, LLC, et al., LASC Case No. BC724445. (Olivo Decl., ¶ 4.) Expecting the presentation of evidence from both sides in the Salas matter to likely conclude by September 3, 2024, Plaintiff counsel states that he will endeavor to have the responses provided during any down time for the trial or immediately after its conclusion. (Olivo Decl., ¶ 5.)Tentative RulingThe instant motion is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to provide objection-less responses to the Defendants’ Requests for Production of Documents (Set One), within 20 days from the date of the hearing.The Court will not award monetary sanctions at this time based upon counsel’s representations; however, continued failure to respond to discovery by Plaintiff may result in future monetary sanctions.
