On July

2024.  Plaintiff did not file

PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Defendant
asks the Court to compel Plaintiff to provide responses to request for
production of documents, set one, special interrogatories, set one, and form
interrogatories, set one, and to pay Defendant monetary sanctions. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order
compelling a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including
the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent exceptional
circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or any attorney
of a party for failure to provide electronically stored information that has
been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of the routine, good
faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides: 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.)  
DISCUSSION 
On September
7, 2023, Defendant served request for production of documents, set one, special
interrogatories, set one, and form interrogatories, set one, on Plaintiff.  Plaintiff did not provide timely responses
and had not provided responses by the time Defendant filed these motions. 
The
Court grants the motions to compel. 
Defendant
requests $825.00 in sanctions for each motion.  However, Defendant has not identified a
statutory basis for sanctions.  Under Code
of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300, sanctions are available against parties, persons, and attorneys who unsuccessfully make or oppose a
motion to compel a response to interrogatories or requests for production.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c)
[interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c) [demand for inspection].)  Plaintiff has not made or opposed a motion to
compel responses to interrogatories or requests for production.  
Defendant
also relies on the statutory definition of misuse of the discovery
process.  (Code Civ. Proc, §
2023.010.)  However, “[Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.010 is] ‘definitional’ and monetary sanctions may not be
imposed based solely on [the statute]. 
Monetary sanctions may be imposed only if authorized by some other
provision of the Discovery Act.”  (L.
Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial
(Rutter 2023) ¶ 8:1900, p. 8M-2; see Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030 [court may
impose sanctions for misuse of the discovery process “[t]o the extent
authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or other
provision of this title”]; City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers,
LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 498-504.) 
The
Court denies Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions. 
CONCLUSION 
 The Court GRANTS Defendant Robert Romo’s motion to
compel Plaintiff John Dunton’s responses to request for production of
documents, set one, and orders Plaintiff John Dunton to serve verified
code-compliant responses, without objections, and to produce the documents,
electronically stored information, and/or other things requested without
objections by April 29, 2024. 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Robert Romo’s motion to compel Plaintiff John Dunton’s
responses to special interrogatories, set one, and orders Plaintiff John Dunton
to serve verified code-compliant responses, without objections, to the special
interrogatories by April 29, 2024. 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Robert Romo’s motion to compel Plaintiff John Dunton’s
responses to form interrogatories, set one, and orders Plaintiff John Dunton to
serve verified code-compliant responses, without objections, to the form
interrogatories by April 29, 2024. 
The
Court DENIES Defendant Robert Romo’s requests for sanctions. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
