And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the motions to compel filed by the defendant, Robert Romo. The defendant had requested that the court compel the plaintiff, John Dunton, to provide responses to requests for production of documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories. The plaintiff had failed to provide timely responses to these requests.

The court has granted the motions to compel, ordering the plaintiff to serve verified code-compliant responses to the requests for production, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories by April 29, 2024. The court has also ordered the plaintiff to produce the documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things requested without objections.

However, the court has denied the defendant's request for monetary sanctions. The defendant had requested $825.00 in sanctions for each motion, but the court did not find that the plaintiff had engaged in behavior that justified the imposition of sanctions.

The court has also ruled that the plaintiff's failure to provide timely responses was not a result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and therefore, the court did not find that the plaintiff had waived any objections to the requests for production, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories.
