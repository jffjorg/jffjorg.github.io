And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the moving and response papers and rules as follows. The case involves a motor vehicle tort, general negligence, and emotional distress claim filed by plaintiff Menajoyrie Melentha Francis Webster against defendant Ramiro Montiel Lopez and Does 1-20. The defendant filed a motion to compel plaintiff's further responses to form interrogatories, set one, and for sanctions. The court finds that the defendant has satisfied the informal discovery conference requirement and that the motion is timely. The court also finds that the defendant has provided a meet and confer declaration and a separate statement as required. However, the court denies the motion as moot because plaintiff served supplemental responses to the form interrogatories after the defendant filed his motion. The court also denies the defendant's request for sanctions against plaintiff, finding that it would be unjust to award sanctions. The court orders the defendant to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service of this ruling with the court within five days.
