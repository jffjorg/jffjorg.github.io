 Case Number:  BC685290    Hearing Date:   March 29, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment, the Court
rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
December 1, 2017, Plaintiffs Michael Fullerton (“Fullerton”) and Brenda Severns (“Severns”) filed this action against
Defendants Licea Logistics, Inc. (“Licea”), John Vela (“Vela”), and Does 1-25
for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. 
On
January 2, 2018, Plaintiffs filed proofs of service of the summons, complaint,
statements of damages, and other documents on Vela and Licea ("Defendants"). 
On
January 24, 2018, Defendants filed an answer. 
On
May 26, 2021, the Court granted Defendants’ counsel’s motion to be relieved as
counsel. Counsel was relieved on June 8, 2021. Defendants have not notified the
Court that they have retained new counsel. 
On
December 16, 2022, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed a notice of termination of stay,
which stated in part: 
“On or about June 8, 2020, in the case of Commissioner
of the Department of Financial Regulation v. Global Hawk Insurance Co. Risk
Retention Group, (Civil Division Docket No. 196-5-20 Wncv), before the State of
Vermont, Superior Court Washington Unit, an Order of Liquidation was entered,
which included a stay of proceedings involving any claim being defended by
Global Hawk Insurance Co. Risk Retention Group (‘Global Hawk’). SEE EXHIBIT 1
(page 8, Paragraph 9.) Global Hawk was the insurance carrier providing defense
for Defendants Licea Logistics, Inc and John Vela in this action up to that
point.”
“The stay described above as to Global Hawk is no
longer in effect because it expired on August 8, 2020 (60 days from when the
above order was issued.) Plaintiff’s counsel learned of this on September 19,
2022 as a result of email correspondence with the liquidator in the Vermont
case. SEE EXHIBIT 2. 4. As a result, the lawsuit against Defendants in the
current matter with this Superior Court may proceed.” 
On
October 19, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a motion to strike Defendants’ answer and
enter their defaults. Defendants did not file an opposition. 
On
October 27, 2023, the Court issued an order stating: “The Court intends to
strike defendants’ Answer pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 575.2 and
the 8th Amended Standing Order re: Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub if the
Defendants fail to appear at the Final Status Conference and Trial.” (See
October 30, 2023 Nunc Pro Tunc Order.) The Court continued the final status
conference and trial to November 14, 2023. 
On
November 14, 2023, Defendants did not appear for the final status conference
and trial. The Court struck Defendants’ answer. 
On
November 15, 2023, Fullerton and Severns each filed statements of damages
sought against Defendants. 
On
November 21, 2023, the clerk entered Defendants' defaults. 
On
December 8, 2023, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at
