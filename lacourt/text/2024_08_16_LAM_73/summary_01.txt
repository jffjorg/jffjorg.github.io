Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court denies Defendants' motion to compel arbitration. The Court finds that the arbitration agreement does not "clearly and unmistakably" require union members to arbitrate their statutory claims. The Court also finds that Defendants have not waived their right to arbitrate and that the agreement to arbitrate is not valid. The Court notes that the arbitration agreement is permissive, stating that a dispute or grievance "may" be referred to arbitration, rather than requiring arbitration as the "sole and exclusive remedy" for a statutory violation.
