Background
 
            On  August 9,
2024, Plaintiffs Nina Gardner (“Gardner”) and Renee Bixby (“Bixby”)
(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint against Defendant 111 W 7 Owner
LLC (“Defendant”) and DOES 1 through 10, inclusive for: (1) Breach of Implied
Warranty of Habitability; (2) Negligence; (3) Nuisance; (4) Breach of Quiet
Enjoyment; (5) Violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act, Civ. Code § 51; (6)
Violations of the California Anti-Harassment Statute, cal. Civ. Code § 1940.2;
and (7) Violations of the Los Angeles Anti-Harassment Statute, LAMC § 8.52.130 et
seq.
 
            The
Complaint alleges Plaintiffs entered into a rental agreement with Defendant to
reside at the property located at 111 W 7th Street, Apt 817, Los
Angeles, CA, 90014 (“Subject Property”). (Compl., ¶1.) Plaintiffs suffered and
continue to suffer from defective water pipes, plumbing issues, rats, roaches,
and other insect infestation, mold, etc. at the Subject Property due to
Defendant’s neglect. (Id. at ¶7.) Plaintiffs made complaints of these
conditions to Defendant through its managers on several occasions, who failed
to abate them. (Id. at ¶¶22-24.)
 
            On
October 25, 2024, Defendant filed the
instant Motion to Strike without demurrer. On December 12, 2024, Plaintiffs
filed an Opposition. On the same day, Defendant filed a Reply. 
 
Legal Standard
 
“Any party, within the time allowed to respond
to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any
part thereof, but this time limitation shall not apply to motions specified in
subdivision (e).” (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1).)¿¿
 
“The court may, upon a motion made pursuant to
Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper:
(a) Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any
pleading.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (a).)¿
 
Preliminary Issues
 
Defendant contends Plaintiffs’ opposition is untimely. This
motion was initially noticed for hearing on December 19, 2024, thus Plaintiffs’
opposition was due on December 6, 2024. Plaintiffs’ did not file their
opposition until December 12, 2024, the day the reply brief was due. As such,
Plaintiffs’ opposition was untimely. Nevertheless, Defendant was able to reply
to the substantive arguments of the opposition.
 
Therefore, the Court will exercise its discretion and rule
on the merits below. 
 
Discussion
 
            Meet and
Confer 
Prior to filing a motion to
strike, moving party is required to meet and confer in person, by telephone, or
by video-conference with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to
the motion to strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can
be reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5.)¿¿¿
Here, Defendant’s counsel attests
to being unable to meet and confer with Plaintiffs’ counsel prior to the filing
of this motion due to lack of response from Plaintiffs’ counsel to her efforts.
(Issagholi Decl., ¶2.) Therefore, the Court will exercise its discretion and
rule on the merits below. 
            Merits
of Motion 
Defendant moves for an order
striking paragraphs 139, 151, 153, 163, and the prayer for punitive damages from
Plaintiffs’ Complaint on the grounds that Plaintiffs have failed to plead
specific facts sufficient to support such claim. Plaintiffs oppose the motion. 
To state a claim for punitive
damages under Civil Code section 3294, a plaintiff must allege specific facts
showing that the¿defendant has been guilty of malice, oppression or fraud. (Smith
v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal. App. 4th 1033, 1042.) The basis for
punitive damages must be pled with specificity; conclusory allegations devoid
of any factual assertions are insufficient. Id. A motion to strike may lie
where the facts alleged, if proven, would not support a finding that the
defendant acted with malice, fraud or oppression. (Turman v. Turning Point
of Central California (2010) 191 Cal. App. 4th 53, 63.¿)
“Malice” is defined in section
3294(c)(1) as “conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury” or
“despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” “Oppression” is defined
in section 3294(c)(2) as “despicable conduct subjecting a person to cruel and
unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.” The term
“despicable” has been defined in the case law as actions that are “base,”
“vile,” or “contemptible.” (Shade Foods, Inc. v. Innovative Products Sales
& Marketing, Inc. (2000) 78 Cal. App. 4th 847, 891.)¿¿“Fraud” is
defined in section 3294(c)(3) as “an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or
concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the intention on the
part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights
or otherwise causing injury.”¿¿
To prove that a defendant acted
with “willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others,” it is
not enough to prove negligence, gross negligence or even recklessness. (Dawes
v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal. App. 3d 82, 87.) Rather, a plaintiff must
allege facts demonstrating that “the defendant acted in such an outrageous and
reprehensible manner that the jury could infer that he [or she] knowingly
disregarded the substantial certainty of injury to others.” (Id. at 90).
Further, the allegations must be sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude
that Defendant’s conduct was “despicable” defined as “base, vile or
contemptible.” (College Hospital Inc. v. Superior Court (1994) 8 Cal.
4th 704, 725.)
Here, the Complaint alleges Plaintiffs
suffered from roach and rat bites, contamination of food and clothing,
destruction of property, and damaged walls and flooring due to mold. (Compl.,
¶¶59-62.) The Complaint also alleges Plaintiffs complained to Defendant’s
property managers Summer Smith (“Ms. Smith”) and Michelle Langobardo
(“Langobardo”) about the roach and rat infestation, wall and flooring mold
damages, plumbing issues, electrical issues, etc. from February 2024 to the
filing of the Complaint via texts, phone calls, in-person communication,
voicemails, and emails. (Id. at ¶¶9, 10, 22-24.) The Complaint further
alleges Defendant failed to abate these unhabitable conditions and continued to
retain rent from Plaintiff despite notices from Housing Authority to correct
these conditions. (Id. at ¶¶66-69.) 
Based on these allegations, a
reasonable jury could find that Ms. Smith and Ms. Langobardo are managing
agents of Defendant because they are the property managers of the Subject
Property owned by Defendant. Moreover, a reasonable jury could find that
Defendant acted with willful and conscious disregard to the right and safety of
Plaintiffs.  The Court considers this
case close enough to Penner v. Falk (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 858 to
withstand a motion to strike punitive damages at the pleading stage.Therefore, the Court concludes that
the Complaint alleges specific facts sufficient to support Plaintiffs’ request
for punitive damages.
