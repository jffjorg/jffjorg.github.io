(“Defendant”) to serve further verified responses without objection and produce
all documents responsive to Plaintiff’s First Set of Request for Production of

The COURT DENIES Plaintiff’s requests for
sanctions. 
 
 
Background
 
            Plaintiff
alleges that she suffered injuries when she tripped and fell when she was
legally at Dodgers Stadium on April 15, 2022. (Complaint ¶ 15.) Plaintiff
further alleges, that the hazardous, dangerous condition was created by Defendants
and/or existed for a sufficient time prior to the incident for Defendants to
have corrected, removed, and/or warned Plaintiff of the existence of said
conditions, all of which Defendants negligently and carelessly failed to do. (Id.)
On April 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed her complaint seeking to recover money
damages from Defendant in a premises liability and negligence suit.           
 
Discussion
 
            Timeliness

            The motion is timely
because the parties agreed to an extension. Here, Defendant served verified
responses on August 27, 2024. Forty-five (45) days after service would be October
11, 2024. Plaintiff filed the instant motion on November 12, 2024.
Nevertheless, the parties agreed to a November 22, 2024, extension. Thus, the
motion is timely. 
            Meet
and Confer
            The motion must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration in compliance with Code of Civil
Procedure Section 2016.040. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (b); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b).)
            Plaintiff’s counsel had
a “meet and confer” telephone conference with defense counsel on September 11,
2024. (Robie Decl. ¶ 14; Kanarek Decl. ¶ 7.) Thus, the meet and confer
requirement was satisfied. 
            Request
for Production 
          Plaintiff moves to compel further responses from Defendant
to Requests for Production of Documents (Set One) Nos. 1-6; 13, 17, and 18. 
The following are
requested:
          Request for Production of Documents No. 1: All video
footage of any and all trip and falls in YOUR possession occurring on DODGERS
PROPERTY SURROUNDING THE ACTUAL STADIUM from April 15, 2015, to July 9, 2024.
          Request for Production of Documents No. 2: All DOCUMENTS
wherein YOU were made aware of a trip and fall occurring on DODGERS PROPERTY
SURROUNDING THE ACTUAL STADIUM from April 15, 2015 to July 9, 2024.
          Request for Production of Documents No. 3: All DOCUMENTS
evidencing any investigation by YOU of a trip and fall occurring on DODGERS
PROPERTY SURROUNDING THE ACTUAL STADIUM from April 15, 2015 to July 9, 2024.
          Request for Production of Documents No. 4: All
communications (emails, memos, documents) created by YOU as a result of a trip
and fall on DODGERS PROPERTY SURROUNDING THE ACTUAL STADIUM from April 15,
2015, to July 9, 2024.
          Request for Production of Documents No. 5: All depositions
taken during the litigation of a lawsuit where the plaintiff alleged to have
tripped and fallen on DODGERS PROPERTY SURROUNDING THE ACTUAL STADIUM from
April 15, 2015 to July 9, 2024.
          Request for Production of Documents No. 6: All depositions
of any of YOUR employees taken during the litigation of a lawsuit alleging a
trip and fall on DODGERS PROPERTY SURROUNDING THE ACTUAL STADIUM from April 15,
2015, to July 9, 2024.
          Request for Production of Documents No. 13: All DOCUMENTS
that relate to any attempt by YOU to find video footage of the SUBJECT
INCIDENT.
          Request for Production of Documents No. 17: All DOCUMENTS
that evidence any REPAIRS that occurred on DODGERS PROPERTY SURROUNDING THE
ACTUAL STADIUM prior to the SUBJECT INCIDENT from April 15, 2015 to July 9,
2024. 
          Request for Production of Documents No. 18: All DOCUMENTS
that evidence any COMPLAINT made by anyone to YOU regarding the condition of
the walkway, street or parking lot surfaces including the presence of any
uplifts, holes, or other walkway defects on DODGERS PROPERTY SURROUNDING THE
ACTUAL STADIUM from April 15, 2015, to July 9, 2024.
          Plaintiff argues that further response is warranted because the
requests are limited in time (4/15/15 - 7/9/24), scope (trip and falls) and
geography (outside concourses/parking lots). (Not. of Mot. at p. 8.) Further,
Plaintiff argues that good cause exists for the requests because Plaintiff has
the burden of proof to show actual or constructive notice. (Id. at p.
9.) 
          In opposition, Defendant argues that the requests are
burdensome, violate attorney client privilege, and there are third party
privilege concerns. (Opp. at p. 2.) Specifically, Defendant argues that it
would cost the Dodgers hundreds of hours of employee time to review the
documents necessary to determine whether documents exist in their possession
custody and control responsive to these requests. (Id.) In addition,
documents responsive to those requests would include substantial amounts of
personal third-party information protected by case law and the California
Constitution. (Id.) Such private third-party information would be
included in the documents sought in response to request Nos. 5 and 6, Finally,
request nos. 2, 3, 4, 13, and 18 appear to invade the attorney client privilege
and work product protections. (Id.) Additionally, sanctions are not
warranted because the objections were substantially justified. 
          In reply, Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s arguments are
meritless because they are conclusory and not substantiated by evidence. (Reply
at p.2.)
          Burdensomeness and Confidentiality Nos.
1-6; 17-18
          The Court concludes that the time frame Plaintiff requests between
April 15, 2015, to July 9, 2024, is excessive since the alleged fall occurred
on April 15,
2022. Plaintiff failed to show that good
cause exists for her requests of approximately 10 years’ worth of documents and
footage. Nevertheless, Plaintiff has shown good cause for the requests of
substantially similar incidents. Thus, the Court further limits the scope to
January 1, 2020 - April 15, 2022. Additionally, Defendant is able to redact any
identifying information to prevent HIPPA violations.  
          The Court is also comfortable limiting the time frame as
Defendant has already provided Plaintiff a spreadsheet detailing a wider range
of incidents.  If there are any outside
the time frame that appear particularly relevant, Plaintiff can within reason seek
such documents specifically.
                    Work-Product and
Confidentiality No. 13
          Plaintiff requests “All DOCUMENTS that relate to any
attempt by YOU to find video footage of the SUBJECT INCIDENT.” Defendant
objected as follows: “Objection. This request seeks information protected by
the attorney client privilege and work product protections. Without waiving
those objections, after a reasonable search and diligent inquiry, responding
party is not in possession of any documents that are responsive to this request
that are not protected by the above protections.” (Def.’s Res. to Sep. Stat. at
p. 7.)  While objecting to preserve
attorney-client privilege, Defendant stated unequivocally that there are no
such documents. This is sufficient. 
          Monetary Sanctions 
          The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a further response to request for admissions and
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (d).)
          Plaintiff requests
sanctions in the amount of $4,860.00 against Defendant, Los Angeles Dodgers, LLC and their attorney of record,
Jerome M. Jackson and Leigh Robie of the Long & Levit Law. Since the motion was
granted in part and denied in part, sanctions would be unjust. Thus, the Court
denies sanctions.
