Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies Defendant 111 W 7 Owner LLC's motion to strike punitive damages from the Complaint filed by Plaintiffs Nina Gardner and Renee Bixby. The Complaint alleges that the Defendant failed to maintain the Subject Property in a habitable condition, leading to various unhabitable conditions, including roach and rat infestation, mold, and plumbing issues. The Complaint also alleges that the Defendant's property managers failed to abate these conditions despite complaints from the Plaintiffs. The judge concludes that the Complaint alleges specific facts sufficient to support the Plaintiffs' request for punitive damages and that the Defendant's conduct was "despicable" and "willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others."
