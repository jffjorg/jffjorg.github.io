And here is the English-text summary:

The Honorable Gary Y. Tanaka has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the complaint filed by Teresa Herrera and others against South Bay Ford, Inc. and others. The demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. The plaintiffs alleged that their 2021 Ford Explorer has various defects and that the defendant breached express and implied warranties. However, the court found that the plaintiffs failed to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action for negligent repair. The court held that the economic loss rule applies, and since the plaintiffs have not alleged or revealed economic damages, their claim for negligent repair is barred.
