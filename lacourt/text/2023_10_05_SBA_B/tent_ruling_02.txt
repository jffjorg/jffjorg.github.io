Set One

Santa Monica
Propeller Service, Inc.’s Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production

TENTATIVE RULING

Santa Monica Propeller Service, Inc.’s Motions to
Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories and Request for Production of
Documents, Set One, are granted.  
 
Background
 
Plaintiff’s Complaint was filed on February 15, 2022,
and the First Amended Complaint was filed on May 9, 2022. Plaintiff alleges the
following facts. Defendant breached the contract wherein Defendant was required
to service Plaintiff’s propellers. Defendant filed a Cross-Complaint on June
30, 2022.   
 
Motions to
Compel/Deem Admitted
 
CCP § 2030.290 states: “If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the following
rules apply…The party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories.” (CCP § 2030.290(b).)  
 
CCP § 2031.300 states: “If a party to whom a demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a
timely response to it, the following rules shall apply: The party making the
demand may move for an order compelling response to the demand.”  (CCP § 2031.300(b)).
 
Defendant served upon Plaintiff Form Interrogatories,
Set One and Request for Production of Documents, Set One, on March 14, 2023. (Decl.,
Christopher Harshman, ¶¶ 5-6.)  Defendant
contends that it did not receive any responses.  (Id. at ¶¶ 9-10.) 
 
Plaintiff filed written oppositions on September 19,
2023. The oppositions are, strangely, in opposition to motions to compel further
responses when no such motions were filed.  According to the declarations of Plaintiff’s
counsel, it appears that he is contending that he never received the discovery
requests. However, the moving party set forth facially valid proofs of service
indicating valid service of the discovery requests.  The Court cannot simply rely upon a party’s or
counsel’s self-serving statement that discovery requests were never received.   
 
Therefore, the motions to compel responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Production of Documents, Set One, are
granted.  Plaintiff is ordered to serve
verified responses within 10 days of this date.
 
Sanctions
 
Defendant’s requests for monetary sanctions are granted.
 
Plaintiff and plaintiff’s counsel are sanctioned the
total amount of $1,470.00 which is calculated at 3 hours to prepare and appear
at $450/hour and $120 in filing fees. Sanctions are payable within 30 days of
this date.  
 
Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
