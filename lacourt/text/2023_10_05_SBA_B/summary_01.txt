Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the petition to compel arbitration without prejudice. The petitioners, S. Roger Rombro, et al., argue that a valid arbitration agreement exists between the parties and that the respondent, Augustin Pyo, has refused to arbitrate. However, the respondent has filed a written opposition stating that he has not refused to arbitrate. The judge finds that the petitioners have established the existence of a valid arbitration agreement but have not met their initial burden to establish that arbitration must be ordered. Therefore, the petition to compel arbitration is denied without prejudice.
