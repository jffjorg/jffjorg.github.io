1.     
South Bay Ford’s Demurrer
to Complaint   
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING

South Bay Ford’s Demurrer to Complaint is sustained
with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Background 
 
Plaintiffs filed the Complaint on March 24, 2023.
Plaintiffs allege the following facts. Plaintiffs allege that their 2021 Ford
Explorer suffers from defects - suspension, exterior, structural, engine, and
electrical. Plaintiff sets forth a cause of action under the Song-Beverly Act for
Breach of Express and Implied Warranty as well as a cause of action for “Negligent
Repair.”  
 
            Meet and Confer
             
            Defendant set forth a meet and
confer declaration in sufficient compliance with CCP § 430.41.  (Decl., Ravi K. Lally.)  
 
            Demurrer

A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v.
Foundation Health (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In testing the sufficiency of the complaint,
the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.)  The Court may not
consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe (1994) 7 Cal.App.4th
634, 638.) Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint, the
plaintiff must show that the complaint alleges facts sufficient to establish
every element of each cause of action.  (Rakestraw
v. California Physicians Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.)  Where the complaint fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.
 (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig v. County
of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
Sufficient facts are the essential facts
of the case "with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently
specific to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his
cause of action.”  (Gressley v.
Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.) "Whether the plaintiff will be able to
prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer."  (Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180
Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.)  Under Code
Civil Procedure § 430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is
“uncertain.” Uncertainty exists where a
complaint’s factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently
apprise a defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
Defendant demurs to the fourth cause of
action for Negligent Repair for failure to state facts sufficient facts to
state a cause of action.
Fourth Cause of Action for Negligent Repair 

Defendant’s demurrer to the fourth cause of action is sustained
with 20 days leave to amend. Plaintiffs fail to state facts sufficient to state
a cause of action. 
 
“To state a cause of action for negligence, a
plaintiff must allege (1) the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care, (2)
the defendant breached that duty, and (3) the breach proximately caused the
plaintiff's damages or injuries.” Lueras v. BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP (2013)
221 Cal.App.4th 49, 62
 
“[T]he economic loss rule provides: [W]here a
purchaser's expectations in a sale are frustrated because the product he bought
is not working properly, his remedy is said to be in contract alone, for he has
suffered only ‘economic’ losses. This doctrine hinges on a distinction drawn
between transactions involving the sale of goods for commercial purposes where
economic expectations are protected by commercial and contract law, and those
involving the sale of defective products to individual consumers who are
injured in a manner which has traditionally been remedied by resort to the law
of torts. The economic loss rule requires a purchaser to recover in contract
for purely economic loss due to disappointed expectations, unless he can
demonstrate harm above and beyond a broken contractual promise. Quite simply,
the economic loss rule prevent[s] the law of contract and the law of tort from
dissolving one into the other.” Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp.
(2004) 34 Cal.4th 979, 988 (internal citations and quotations omitted). “[C]onduct amounting to a breach of contract becomes
tortious only when it also violates a duty independent of the contract arising
from principles of tort law. An omission to perform a contract obligation is
never a tort, unless that omission is also an omission of a legal duty.” Erlich
v. Menezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th 543, 551 (internal citations and quotations
omitted).
 
As noted above, Plaintiffs’ first cause of action is
based on an express contractual warranty. Plaintiffs then alleged a separate
fourth cause of action for Negligence. Plaintiffs allege: “Plaintiffs delivered
the Subject Vehicle to Defendant SOUTH BAY FORD, INC. for repair of on numerous
occasions. ... Defendant SOUTH BAY FORD, INC. owed a duty to Plaintiffs to use
ordinary care and skill in storage, preparation and repair of the Subject
Vehicle in accordance with industry standards. ... Defendant SOUTH BAY FORD,
INC. breached its duty to Plaintiffs to use ordinary care and skill by failing
to properly store, prepare and repair of the Subject Vehicle in accordance with
industry standards. ... Defendant SOUTH BAY FORD, INC.’s negligent breach of
its duties owed to Plaintiffs was a proximate cause of Plaintiffs’ damages.”
(Complaint, ¶¶ 53-56.)  Plaintiffs have
not articulated a duty of care owed to them by Defendant that is separate and
apart from the contractual duty upon which the first cause of action is based.
In addition, Plaintiffs have merely set forth a conclusion with respect to
damages as the Complaint does not allege or reveal that Plaintiffs have any
economic damages since Plaintiffs have specifically alleged the existence of a
warranty.
 
Thus, Defendant’s demurrer to the fourth cause of
action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
