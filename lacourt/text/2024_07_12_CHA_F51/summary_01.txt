And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motions to compel further responses from the defendant, Dart International, to the plaintiffs' discovery requests. The defendant is ordered to provide code-compliant, objection-free responses to the discovery requests within 30 days. The judge also imposes monetary sanctions of $1,500 on the defendant's counsel for failing to timely and properly respond to the discovery requests and for failing to oppose the motions. The judge notes that the defendant's objections to the discovery requests are waived due to the untimeliness of its responses, and therefore the defendant must provide objection-free responses to the requests and produce the respective documents.
