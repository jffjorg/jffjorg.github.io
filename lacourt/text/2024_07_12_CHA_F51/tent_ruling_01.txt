BACKGROUND
 
This is a consolidated wrongful death action arising from a
vehicle collision which resulted in the death of Juan Carlos Menjivar and Ana
Elena Moreno Santos (collectively, “Decedents”). On 8/15/21, while traveling on
Interstate-5 Southbound, north of San Fernando Mission Boulevard, Los Angeles,
CA, decedent Menjivar drove his vehicle into a parked truck driven by defendant
Dart International’s employee, defendant Dewayne Maurice Floyd, while the truck
was parked on the shoulder of the highway. The collision caused the death of
both Menjivar and decedent Moreno Santos, who was a passenger in Menjivar’s
vehicle. At all relevant times, Floyd was allegedly acting within the scope of
his employment with Dart International to transport goods supplied by Moving
Defendant.
 
On 10/13/21, Plaintiffs Jezebel Moreno (decedent Moreno
Santos’ biological daughter and successor-in-interest) and Marvin Merino
(plaintiff Moreno’s biological father) filed their complaint against Menjivar,
Floyd, and Dart International, alleging the following causes of action: (1)
Wrongful Death; and (2) Negligence in the lead case, LASC Case No. 21STCV37822. On 11/23/21, Plaintiffs filed their first amended
complaint. On 5/12/22, Plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint,
alleging a sole cause of action for Negligence. On 8/29/22, Plaintiffs filed
their third amended complaint, alleging the following causes of action: (1)
Wrongful Death; and (2) Survival. On 5/9/23, Plaintiffs amended their complaint
to name Moving Defendant as previously unnamed Doe defendant 1.
 
On 1/25/22, Moving Plaintiffs Victoria Menjivar and
Sebastien Menjivar (decedent Menjivar’s biological children) filed their
complaint against Floyd and Dart International, alleging the following causes
of action: (1) Motor Vehicle Negligence; and (2) General Negligence in LASC
Case No. 22STCV02907. On 5/21/22, Plaintiffs filed their first amended
complaint.
 
On 8/16/22, Plaintiffs Estate of Ana Elena Moreno Santos,
Arturo Moreno Banda (decedent Moreno Santos’ father), and Maria Santos Flores
(decedent Moreno Santos’ mother) filed their complaint against Menjivar; Floyd;
Dart International; Super Center Concepts, Inc.; Super Center Concepts Holdings
LLC; and Samantah Malexus Menjivar; alleging the following causes of action:
(1) Motor Vehicle Negligence; and (2) General Negligence in LASC Case No.
22STCV26608.
 
On
10/2/23, the parties filed a stipulation to consolidate the three related
cases.
 
On
9/23/22, Moving Plaintiffs propounded the subject discovery requests to
Defendant. (Ex. 1 to Decl of Natalie Kordnaij.) On 1/31/23, Defendant served
its responses thereto. (Ex. 5 to Kordnaij Decl.) On 3/17/23, Moving Plaintiffs
filed the instant motions to compel further responses in Department 30 of the
Spring Street Courthouse. (Kordnaij Decl. ¶ 10.) On 12/4/23, the
case wase transferred to this Court.
 
On 3/7/24, Moving Plaintiffs
re-filed the instant motions to compel Defendant’s further responses to the
subject discovery requests. No oppositions have been filed to date.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A.   
Meet and Confer 
 
Moving Plaintiffs’ counsel declares
that beginning on 1/4/24, she attempted to meet and confer with Defendant’s
counsel, but her efforts were unsuccessful. (Ex. 9 to Kordnaij Decl.) Therefore,
the Court finds that counsel has satisfied the preliminary meet and confer
requirement under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.300, subdivision (b)(1)
and 2031.310, subdivision (b)(2).
 
B.    
Defendant’s
Discovery Responses
 
 
Moving Plaintiffs seek to compel Defendant’s additional
responses to Moving Plaintiffs’ first set of RFPs, Special Interrogatories, and
Form Interrogatories, arguing that Defendant’s objection-only responses are not
code-compliant and without merit. “Here, Defendant’s deadline to respond
to discovery was on December 15, 2022. … Defendant failed to answer the
discovery timely, and instead provided untimely and unverified responses on
January 31, 2023. Defendant waived all objections to the requests due to the
untimeliness of his responses, and therefore is required to provide objection
free responses to the requests [and interrogatories] and produce the respective
documents.” (Pls.’ RFP Mot. 6:18–22.)
 
Here, upon
Defendant’s request, the parties agreed to extend Defendant’s deadline to
provide responses to Moving Plaintiffs’ discovery requests to 12/15/22. (Ex. 4
to Kordnaij Decl.) As Defendant served its responses on 1/31/23, the responses
are untimely. (Ex. 5 to Kordnaij Decl.) The Court
notes that Defendant has failed to oppose the instant motions and has therefore
failed to justify the untimeliness of its responses. The Court also notes that
in failing to oppose the instant motions, Defendant has wholly failed to meet its
burden to justify the objections asserted in its discovery responses.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Defendant’s
responses to the subject discovery requests are untimely, and thus
Defendant has waived all objections to the requests. Therefore, Defendant’s
objection-only responses are not code-compliant. Accordingly, the Court grants Moving
Plaintiffs’ motions to compel Defendant’s further objection-free responses to the
subject discovery requests.
 
C.   
Sanctions 
 
Here, Moving
Plaintiffs request a total combined sum of $8,400.00 in monetary
sanctions against Defendant, accounting for a total of 28 hours of Moving
Plaintiffs’ attorney’s time spent preparing the instant motions, reviewing
Defendant’s oppositions, preparing replies, and appearing at the instant
hearings, at counsel’s hourly billing rate of $300.00 per hour. (Kordnaij Decl.
¶
14.) In granting the instant unopposed motions, the Court finds it reasonable
to award Plaintiffs monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,500.00 against Defendant’s
counsel.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motions are granted. Defendant
ordered to provide code-compliant, objection-free responses to the following
discovery requests within 30 days:
·        
Moving
Plaintiffs’ Requests for Production (“RFPs”), Set One, Nos. 1–100;
·        
Moving
Plaintiffs’ Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 1–9; and
·        
Moving
Plaintiffs’ Form Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 3.1–3.7, 4.1, 4.2, 12.1–12.7,
13.1, 13.2, 14.1, 14.2, 15.1, 16.1–16.10.
The
Court imposes monetary sanctions against Defendant’s counsel in the amount of $1,500.00.
