Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is granting the Plaintiffs' motion for an order compelling Ford to provide further responses to Special Interrogatory Requests Nos. 25 and 40-45. Ford's objections to these requests are not justified, as the requests are relevant to the lawsuit and do not require a showing of "good cause". The judge notes that the Song-Beverly Act does not require a consumer to request a repurchase of a vehicle to recover under the Act. Ford's objections to the requests are also not justified on the ground that they seek information protected by the attorney-client privilege. The judge does, however, narrow the time frame of Special Interrogatory Requests Nos. 40-41 to cover the period between the date of purchase and the present. Ford is directed to provide responses to the requests within 21 days from the hearing date.
