```

Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is granting the Plaintiffs' motion for an order compelling Ford to provide further responses to Special Interrogatory Requests Nos. 25 and 40-45. Ford's objections to these requests are not justified, as the requests are relevant to the lawsuit and do not require a showing of "good cause". The judge notes that the Song-Beverly Act does not require a consumer to request a repurchase of a vehicle to recover under the Act. Ford's objections to the requests are also not justified on the ground that they seek information protected by the attorney-client privilege. The judge does, however, narrow the time frame of Special Interrogatory Requests Nos. 40-41 to cover the period between the date of purchase and the present. Ford is directed to provide responses to the requests within 21 days from the hearing date.

**English Text Summary:**

In this case, Austin Smith and Christopher Alery (Plaintiffs) sued Ford Motor Company (Ford) claiming that their certified pre-owned Ford Fusion did not meet warranty standards and that Ford's repair facilities failed to fix the issues.

The Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel Ford to answer certain interrogatories (questions) more fully. Ford objected to these questions, arguing they were irrelevant because the Plaintiffs didn't request a repurchase of the vehicle and that some questions sought protected attorney-client information.

The Judge disagreed with Ford, stating that the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act doesn't require a consumer to request a repurchase. The Judge also found that Ford's claims of attorney-client privilege weren't broadly applicable to all the questions.

The Court ordered Ford to provide complete and specific answers to the Plaintiffs' interrogatories within 21 days.

**Summary:**

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting the Plaintiffs' motion for an order compelling Ford to provide further responses to Request Numbers 25 and 40-45 in Plaintiffs' Special Interrogatories, Set One.

The Court also finds that Ford's objections to the requests are unjustified and that Ford is required to provide substantive, not privileged, responses to the requests. The Court directs Ford to provide responses to Interrogatory Nos. 25 and 40-45 within 21 days from the hearing on the Motion.

**Defendant:** Ford Motor Company

**People-Names:** Austin Smith, Christopher Alery

**Company-Names:** Ford Motor Company

**Places:** Not specified

**Dates:** May 11, 2022 (date of purchasing the Subject Vehicle)

**Events:** Plaintiffs purchased a certified pre-owned 2021 Ford Fusion. Plaintiffs sued Ford under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, claiming that the vehicle did not conform to applicable warranties and that Ford's authorized repair facilities failed to repair it after a reasonable number of opportunities.

**Money:** Not specified

**Intentions:** The Plaintiffs seek an order compelling Ford to provide further responses to Request Numbers 25 and 40-45 in Plaintiffs' Special Interrogatories, Set One.

**Facts:** Ford's responses to Interrogatory Requests consisted of objections, which the Plaintiffs argue are not justified.

**Disputes:** Plaintiffs vs. Ford regarding the justification for Ford's objections to Interrogatory Requests.

**Acts:** Ford objected to Interrogatory Request Nos. 40-45 on the ground that the Requests seek information protected by the attorney-client privilege.

**Agreements:** None specified in the text.

**Laws:** Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, Code of Civil Procedure Section 2030.300

**Case Citations:** Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255, Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 550, Krotin v. Porsche Cars North America, Inc. (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 294

**Statutes:** Not specified in the text.

**Roles:** Plaintiffs (suing Ford), Ford (defending the lawsuit)

**Significant Statements:** The Judge agreed with the Plaintiffs that Ford's objections to the Interrogatory Requests are not justified, and is granting the Motion. Ford failed to establish good cause for an order to compel further responses to interrogatories. Ford's objections to the temporal scope of Request Nos. 40-41 are considered justified, and the time frame will be narrowed to cover the period between the date of purchasing the Subject Vehicle and the present. Ford is directed to provide responses to Interrogatory Nos. 25 and 40-45 within 21 days from the hearing on the Motion.

In the Judge's tentative ruling, the Court is granting the Plaintiffs' motion for an order compelling Ford to provide further responses to specific Interrogatory Requests in their lawsuit against Ford under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The Judge found that Ford's objections to the Interrogatories lacked justification and that Ford failed to establish the good cause requirement for such an order. However, the Judge considered Ford's objections to the temporal scope of Request Nos. 40-41 as justified and narrowed the time frame accordingly. Ford is directed to provide responses to the specified Interrogatories within 21 days from the hearing on the Motion.
