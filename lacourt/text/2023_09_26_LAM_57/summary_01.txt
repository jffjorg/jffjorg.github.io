```

Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is granting the Plaintiffs' motion for an order compelling Ford to provide further responses to Special Interrogatory Requests Nos. 25 and 40-45. Ford's objections to these requests are not justified, as the requests are relevant to the lawsuit and do not require a showing of "good cause". The judge notes that the Song-Beverly Act does not require a consumer to request a repurchase of a vehicle to recover under the Act. Ford's objections to the requests are also not justified on the ground that they seek information protected by the attorney-client privilege. The judge does, however, narrow the time frame of Special Interrogatory Requests Nos. 40-41 to cover the period between the date of purchase and the present. Ford is directed to provide responses to the requests within 21 days from the hearing date.

**English Text Summary:**

In this case, Austin Smith and Christopher Alery (Plaintiffs) sued Ford Motor Company (Ford) claiming that their certified pre-owned Ford Fusion did not meet warranty standards and that Ford's repair facilities failed to fix the issues.

The Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel Ford to answer certain interrogatories (questions) more fully. Ford objected to these questions, arguing they were irrelevant because the Plaintiffs didn't request a repurchase of the vehicle and that some questions sought protected attorney-client information.

The Judge disagreed with Ford, stating that the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act doesn't require a consumer to request a repurchase. The Judge also found that Ford's claims of attorney-client privilege weren't broadly applicable to all the questions.

The Court ordered Ford to provide complete and specific answers to the Plaintiffs' interrogatories within 21 days.
