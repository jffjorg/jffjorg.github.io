And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case BC512427, scheduled for a hearing on November 1, 2023. The Judge has granted the unopposed motion to compel interrogatory responses, requiring the defendant to respond to the interrogatories within 10 court days, except for any attorney/client privileged information. The Judge has also granted the request for sanctions in the amount of $750, payable within 30 days. However, the Judge has denied the motion to compel production of documents, as no specific documents were requested in the document demand. The Judge notes that if objections had been raised to the interrogatories, some of them may have been sustained due to their overly invasive nature, but since no objections were raised, they are waived.
