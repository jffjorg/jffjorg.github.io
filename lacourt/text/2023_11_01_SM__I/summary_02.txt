Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel discovery responses from the defendant. The defendant has failed to respond to discovery requests, and the plaintiff has been forced to file a motion to compel responses. The judge has also imposed sanctions on the defendant and counsel for their failure to comply with the discovery requests.

The judge has warned the defendant that if they continue to fail to comply with discovery requests, the answer will be struck. The judge has also expressed frustration with the defendant's behavior, stating that they are "fast losing trust and confidence" in the defendant and counsel.

The judge has outlined the following guidelines for discovery responses:

* Discovery responses must be served without objection
* Requests for admission are deemed admitted unless served prior to the hearing
* Boilerplate objections are not permitted
* Objections must be tailored to each specific request
* Responses must conform to the Code of Civil Procedure

The judge has also emphasized the importance of the meet and confer process in resolving discovery disputes. The judge has stated that the process should be approached as a problem-solving exercise, and that the parties should have an agreed statement as to the outcome at the conclusion of the process.
