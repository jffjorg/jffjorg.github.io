 Case Number:  BC512427    Hearing Date:   November 1, 2023    Dept:  I The unopposed motion to compel interrogatory responses is
GRANTED.  Responses to interrogatories
will be served without objection other than attorney/client privilege within 10
court days of today.  The request for
sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $750 (which ought to be enough given the
vanilla nature of the motion).  They are
payable within 30 days.  That said, had
there been an objection regarding the interrogatories, the court might well
have sustained some of them because they do appear to be overly invasive.  However, given that no objections were
served, they are waived.  The motion to
compel production of documents is DENIED as it appears that no documents were
specified in the document demand.
