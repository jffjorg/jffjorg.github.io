The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the case 21SMCV00641, scheduled for a final status conference on November 1, 2023. The court had previously admonished the parties to familiarize themselves with the court's FSC rules, but no materials have been filed. The Judge assumes that the case has settled, and will set an OSC re: Dismissal (Settlement) for approximately 45 days out. If the case has not settled, the Judge will hold a status conference on November 9, 2023, to determine the next steps and why the parties ignored the court's FSC order. The trial date has been vacated, as the case is not ready for trial.
