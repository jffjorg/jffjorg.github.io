  Case Number:  21SMCV00641    Hearing Date:   November 1, 2023    Dept:  I The matter is here for a final status conference.  On March 22, 2022, the court admonished the
parties to be familiar with the court’s FSC rules, which are published on
line.  No FSC materials have been
filed.  The court assumes that this is
because the matter has settled.  If so,
the court will set an OSC re: Dismissal (Settlement) for approximately 45 days
out.  If the case has not settled, the
court will need to have a different discussion with the parties.
In either event, the case is NOT READY FOR TRIAL.  The trial date is therefore VACATED.  If the case has not settled, then a status
conference will be held on November 9, 2023, at 9:00 am (following the MSJ) to
determine what the next steps are and why the parties ignored the court’s FSC
order.
