 Case Number:  23SMCV03774    Hearing Date:   November 1, 2023    Dept:  I The motion to deem admitted is DENIED AS MOOT.  Responses without objection have been
served.  The recent declaration regarding
service is troubling.  Defendant contends
that the RFA’s were not served until September 26, 2023.  There is some evidence that such is in fact
the case.  Plaintiff’s counsel did not
attach a proof of service of the original RFA’s and instead merely declared
that counsel was informed they were served. 
That is hearsay.  More troubling,
it appears that someone is lying—either plaintiff’s counsel or the person who
informed plaintiff’s counsel of the service. 
Further, when defendant sought an extension, she was refused, which is
contrary to plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration, which states that no extensions
were sought.  The request for sanctions
is therefore DENIED.  More problematic,
the court is entertaining doubts as to plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration and
the truth thereof.
The matter is also here for a final status conference.  At the TSC set on September 26, 2023, the
court admonished both parties to be familiar with the court’s FSC rules, which
require all FSC materials to be filed. 
The court has received no FSC materials, and thus the case is NOT READY
FOR TRIAL.  The trial date is therefore
VACATED.  The court will hold a new TSC
on November 6, 2023, at 8:30 am.  The
court is hopeful that, perhaps, this is because the case has settled (at least
as to possession).  If so, that would be
a very good reason not to file the FSC materials (although a notice of
settlement would have been nice).  If,
however, that is not the case, then the court will need to have a different
conversation on November 6.
