And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to deem admitted as moot. The court is concerned about the recent declaration regarding service, which reveals that the request for admissions (RFA's) were not served until September 26, 2023. The plaintiff's counsel did not provide a proof of service and instead relied on a hearsay statement. The court also notes that the defendant was refused an extension, which contradicts the plaintiff's counsel's declaration. The request for sanctions is denied. The court is also entertaining doubts about the truth of the plaintiff's counsel's declaration. The case is not ready for trial, and the trial date is vacated. A new final status conference is set for November 6, 2023, at 8:30 am. The court hopes that the case may have settled, but if not, further discussion will be needed.
