 Case Number:  23SMCV02740    Hearing Date:   November 1, 2023    Dept:  I The matter is here for a final status conference.  The court is in receipt of the Stipulated
Judgment dated October 26, 2023, which the court will sign.  The court notes that the financial aspects
are “reserved,” which could mean that the judgment will resolve the case but
plaintiff reserves the right to file a new suit for money, or it might mean
merely that the case remains ongoing but possession is no longer at issue.  If the latter, the court will hold a CMC to
set the remainder of the case for trial in the normal course.  In either event, the trial date is VACATED.
The court congratulates the parties on their ability to
resolve at least the issue of possession.
