And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Maria Teresa Franco v. First Southern Baptist Church of Sylmar, granting the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Jose Soto Plasencia. The court finds that Mr. Soto Plasencia, who is named as a defendant and cross-defendant, failed to comply with a deposition subpoena and did not appear for his deposition or answer questions under oath. The court orders Mr. Soto Plasencia to appear for deposition and answer questions under oath on October 4, 2024, at 10:00 a.m.

The court also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions, as the Legislature has not authorized sanctions in this situation. The court notes that Mr. Soto Plasencia is not a party to the action and therefore is not subject to the sanctions provisions of the Civil Discovery Act.
