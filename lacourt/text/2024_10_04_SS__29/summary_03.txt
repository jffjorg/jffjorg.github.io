And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff, Michele Glenn, to comply with a demand for a physical examination. The plaintiff has refused to submit to an independent medical exam (IME) despite being served notice and repeatedly reminded of the appointment. The defendant, C&D Rentals, LLC, and Kevin Ciara, argue that the refusal hinders their ability to fairly evaluate the plaintiff's claims and defend the case. The judge finds that the defendant is entitled to a physical examination of the plaintiff under California Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.220 and that the plaintiff failed to respond to the demand or appear for the examination. The judge orders the plaintiff to submit to a physical examination by Dr. Tony Feuerman on October __, 2024, at _____ a.m./p.m. at 16133 Ventura Boulevard, Suite 1105, Encino, California, 91436. The request for sanctions is denied as the plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion.
