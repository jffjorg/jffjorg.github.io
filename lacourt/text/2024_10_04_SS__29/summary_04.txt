And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Richard Darrell Jones's motion for summary judgment. The motion was filed on November 13, 2023, and the hearing was initially set for September 19, 2024. The judge has considered the evidence presented and finds that there are disputed issues of material fact that preclude the granting of the motion.

The accident in question occurred on November 13, 2021, when the driver of a motor vehicle, Jones, stopped at a red light at the intersection of Manhattan Beach Boulevard and Highland Avenue. A passenger, Mungaray, opened the door of the vehicle, causing two plaintiffs, who were riding a tandem bicycle, to collide with the door and fall off their bicycle.

The judge has reviewed the evidence and finds that there are triable issues as to Jones's own negligence, including whether he breached his legal duty to the plaintiffs and whether his actions contributed to the accident. The judge has also considered the possibility that Jones could be held responsible for Mungaray's actions, but has determined that there is no need to reach that issue at this time.

The judge has denied the motion for summary judgment and has ordered that notice be given to the parties.
