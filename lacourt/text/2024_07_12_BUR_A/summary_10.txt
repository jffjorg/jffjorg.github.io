And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to discovery requests filed by Rosa Flores, the plaintiff, against Ford Motor Company, the defendant. The motion was filed in response to Ford's initial response to discovery requests, which the plaintiff alleges was incomplete and inadequate.

The judge has denied the motion, finding that the plaintiff's meet and confer efforts were insufficient. The judge notes that the plaintiff waited until the last minute to file the motion, and that the plaintiff's counsel had already received Ford's initial responses to discovery requests over a month prior to filing the motion.

The judge has ordered the parties to meet and confer in good faith, and has denied the motion to compel further responses. The judge has also scheduled a hearing for August 12, 2024, to review the parties' compliance with discovery obligations.
