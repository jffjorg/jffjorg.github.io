ALLEGATIONS: 
 
Plaintiff Rosa
Flores (Plaintiff) brings this action against Ford Motor Company (Ford) for an
alleged violation of the Song Beverly Act. Plaintiff alleges that Ford sold her
a defective 2020 Ford Explorer (the Subject Vehicle). 
 
Before
the Court is a motion by Plaintiff to compel Ford’s further response to Plaintiff’s Request for the Production of
Documents (RFPD) Nos. 1-31. Ford opposes the motion and Plaintiff replies. 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
A motion
to compel further responses to a demand for inspection or production of
documents may be brought based on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2)
inadequate, evasive, or incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3)
unmerited or overly generalized objections.  (C.C.P. § 2031.310(c).) 
 
A motion
to compel further production must set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand. (See C.C.P. §
2031.310(b)(1).) In Digital Music News LLC v Superior Court (2014) 226
Cal.App.4th 216 at 224, the Court defined “good cause” as a showing that there
“a disputed fact that is of consequence in the action and the discovery sought
will tend in reason to prove or disprove that fact or lead to other evidence
that will tend to prove or disprove the fact.”  
 
If the
moving party has shown good cause for the requests for production, the burden
is on the objecting party to justify the objections. (Kirkland v. Sup.Ct
(2002) 95 Cal. App.4th 92, 98.) 
 
“The
court shall limit the scope of discovery if it determines that the burden,
expense, or intrusiveness of that discovery clearly outweighs the likelihood
that the information sought will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”
(C.C.P. § 2017.020(a).) Generally, objections on the ground of burden require
the objecting party to produce evidence of (a) the propounding party's
subjective intent to create burden or (b) the amount of time and effort it
would take to respond. (See West Pico Furniture Co. of Los Angeles v.
Superior Court In and For Los Angeles County (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417.)
However, no such evidence is necessary where discovery is obviously overbroad
on its face. (See Obregon v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424,
431.)  
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
A motion to compel further
responses to a request for production must include a meet and confer
declaration consistent with C.C.P. § 2016.040. (C.C.P. § 2031.310 (b)(2).) In
turn, Section 2016.040 requires that the moving party have made “a reasonable
and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the
motion.” (C.C.P. § 2016.040.) 
 
“A single letter, followed
by a response which refuses concessions, might in some instances be an adequate
attempt at informal resolution, especially when a legitimate discovery
objective is demonstrated. The time available before the motion filing deadline,
and the extent to which the responding party was complicit in the lapse of
available time, can also be relevant. An evaluation of whether, from the
perspective of a reasonable person in the position of the discovering party,
additional effort appeared likely to bear fruit, should also be considered” (Obregon
v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 432.)
 
Upon review of the parties
submissions, the Court finds the meet and confer efforts of Plaintiff were
insufficient. As evidence of their meet and confer efforts, Plaintiff submits a
letter sent on April 18, 2024 to Ford’s counsel. (Sogoyan Decl. Exh. 5.) This
letter appears to thoroughly address the issues that Plaintiff had with Ford’s
initial production and identifies RFPD Nos. 15-31 as requiring further
response. (Id.) The Court notes that the RFPD identified as requiring
further response in this letter differs from the RFPD identified in Plaintiff’s
separate statement, which appears to be all 31 of the RFPD. In response to this
letter, Ford’s counsel agreed to further production of documents on condition
that the parties enter into a stipulated protected order preventing the release
of certain sensitive information. (Sogoyan Decl. Exh. 6.) These sorts of
stipulated protected orders are extremely common in Song-Beverly cases. On
April 25, 2024, Ford served the proposed protective order and asked Plaintiff
to confirm. (Abramova Decl. ¶ 7, Exh. A.) 
 
Plaintiff’s declaration
includes an email exchange dated May 24, 2024 at 11:31 a.m. (See Sogoyan Decl.
Exh. 7.) This email consists of Plaintiff’s counsel returning the stipulated
protective order to Ford’s counsel. (Id.) In the email, Plaintiff
requests that Ford stipulate to a two-week extension on the timeline for
Plaintiff to bring a motion to compel further responses. (Id.) Also on
May 24, 2024 at 6:55 p.m. Plaintiff filed this motion. 
 
The Court does not construe
Ford’s not responding to this email for a period of roughly seven hours to be a
refusal to stipulate to extend the time period. Plaintiff’s counsel had the
stipulated protective order in his possession for a period of over a month by
the time he returned it to Ford. Additionally, Plaintiff received Ford’s initial
responses to her discovery on April 8, 2024. (Abramova Decl. ¶ 5.) By the
Court’s calculation, Plaintiff’s deadline to file this motion would have been
May 23, 2024. (See C.C.P.§ 2031.310(c) [providing the motion to compel further
responses must be filed within 45 days of service.].) As such, the deadline to
file the motion to which Plaintiff sought an extension had already passed at
the time of the May 24 email. Essentially Plaintiff’s counsel waited until the
eleventh hour to sign and return the protective order and request an extension
to file this motion. When Plaintiff’s counsel did not receive a response after
seven hours, he proceeded to file the motion. This is not evidence that Ford’s
counsel refused Plaintiff’s request and it certainly is not evidence of a good
faith meet and confer effort.  The Court
may deny a motion to compel discovery for lack of a reasonable and good faith
attempt to meet and confer. (Townsend v. Superior Court (1998) 61
Cal.App.4th 1431, 1436-1439; Obregon v. Superior Court (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 424, 434-435.)
 
Given the above, the Court
orders denies the motion to compel, and he parties are ordered to meet and
confer in good faith as mandated by C.C.P. §2023.010(i).  It appears to the Court that Ford is willing
to produce further documentation at this juncture which would address several
of the requests in Plaintiff’s motion.
