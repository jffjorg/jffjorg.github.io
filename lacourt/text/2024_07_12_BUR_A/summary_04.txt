And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the demurrer and motion to strike filed by NBCUniversal, LLC & NBCUniversal Media, LLC, and has made the following tentative rulings:

* The demurrer to the second cause of action for violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act is sustained without leave to amend. This means that the plaintiffs have not adequately stated their claim and cannot proceed with their lawsuit.
* The motion to strike paragraphs one and three of the prayer for relief is granted without leave to amend. This means that the court will not consider these paragraphs in the lawsuit.
* The motion to strike paragraph two of the prayer for relief is denied. This means that the court will consider this paragraph in the lawsuit.

The judge has also noted that the plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to support their cause of action for violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act. Specifically, the judge has ruled that the 90-minute wait for the elevator was not a denial of accommodations, but rather a circumstance that arose from the use of the elevator by able-bodied persons.

The judge's tentative ruling will become the final ruling of the court unless the parties submit written arguments or request oral argument within the specified timeframe.
