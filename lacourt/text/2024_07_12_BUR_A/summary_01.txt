Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

On July 12, 2024, the judge issued a tentative ruling on a motion to consolidate two related cases, Case No. 22BBCV01306 and Case No. 24NNCV00856. The cases involve a real estate transaction and a buyer/broker agreement. The Volkens, who are Cross-Defendants in both cases, moved to consolidate the cases. The judge found that the motion complies with the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.350 and that there exist common questions of law and fact indicating that consolidation is appropriate. The judge also noted that no party has objected to consolidation and that Plaintiff has filed a notice of non-opposition to the motion. Therefore, the judge GRANTED the motion to consolidate the two cases for all purposes, with Case No. 22BBCV01306 as the lead case. The judge ordered that all documents filed in the consolidated cases after the date of the order must include the caption and case number of the lead case, followed by the case numbers of all the other consolidated cases.
