And here is the English summary:

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena served on the Burbank Police Department (BPD) by Plaintiff Brenda Armstrong. The subpoena seeks the police report generated in connection with a motor vehicle incident on April 21, 2021, in which Plaintiff was injured. The BPD declined to comply with the subpoena, citing Plaintiff's failure to serve a Notice to Consumer as required by California Code of Civil Procedure (C.C.P.) § 1985.3(b). The Court finds good cause to waive the consumer notice requirement given the logistic impossibility of Plaintiff's compliance and grants the motion to compel compliance with the deposition subpoena. The Court orders the BPD to produce the police report within 30 days.
