And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge F.M. Tavelman in a case between Victoria Abdo and Mark Towhidlow. Abdo is seeking specific performance of an agreement between her and Towhidlow for the transfer of real property. Towhidlow has refused to honor the terms of the agreement and has filed a Cross-Complaint against Abdo and others.

The Court has sustained Abdo's demurrer to the second cause of action for Fraud, which alleges that Towhidlow was defrauded by Abdo and others. The Court found that the allegations were insufficiently particular and did not specify how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were made.

The Court has also granted Abdo's motion to compel initial discovery responses from Towhidlow, as well as her motion to deem certain requests for admissions admitted. The Court has imposed sanctions on Towhidlow and his counsel in the amount of $1,000 for failure to timely respond to discovery demands and for failing to file opposition to the motion.

The Court has set a Case Management Conference and OSC RE Proof of Service as to Cross-Complaint for November 5, 2024, at 9:00 AM.
