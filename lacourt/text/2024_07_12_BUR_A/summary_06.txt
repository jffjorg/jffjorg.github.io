Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Caltrans' motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $41,075 and costs in the amount of $12,198.55. The motion was filed in an unlawful detainer matter where Caltrans sought possession of a property from Apex Development, Inc. and Anthony Nowaid. Caltrans is the prevailing party in the matter and is entitled to attorney's fees under the written lease agreement between the parties. The Judge found that the amount of fees requested was reasonable, based on the uncontested records of attorney time spent on the case and the hours billed. The Judge also found that the cost award was proper and that Apex did not bring a corresponding motion to tax any of these costs within the 15-day time limit.
