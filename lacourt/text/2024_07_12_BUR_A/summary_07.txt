And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to deem matters in the Request for Admissions (RFA) admitted, as the Defendant failed to respond to the RFA. The Court notes that the Defendant's failure to respond waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege or work product. The Court also declines to grant sanctions, as the Plaintiff did not request them and the Court is required to impose mandatory sanctions only if a party's failure to timely respond to RFA necessitates a motion to compel. The motion is granted, and the RFA matters are deemed admitted.
