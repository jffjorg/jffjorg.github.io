ALLEGATIONS:

 
On September 25, 2023, The People of the State of
California, acting by and through the Department of Transportation (Caltrans)
brought this action against Apex Development, Inc. (Apex), Anthony Nowaid
(Nowaid), Eriks Towing, The Habibi Shack, Challenger Trucking Express, Stone
Concrete Mix, and Valley Green Tree Services. This was an unlawful detainer
matter in which Caltrans sought possession from Apex and Nowaid (Defendants) of
the property located at 12398 Sheldon Street, Sun Valley, CA 91352 (Subject
Property). 
 
On May
30, 2024, the parties stipulated to the entry of judgment as against Apex. The
stipulated judgment was for possession of the property and for $189,853.44 in
damages assessed against Apex. The stipulation did not include a judgment of
damages as against Nowaid. 
 
Caltrans
now moves for an award of attorney’s fees based on a corresponding provision of
the parties’ written lease agreement. Apex has submitted no opposition to the motion.
 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD:
 
The
prevailing party in “any action on a contract” shall be awarded reasonable
attorney’s fees incurred to enforce that contract where the contract
specifically provides for attorney's fees. (Civ. Code § 1717(a).)
 
The Court
begins the attorney fee inquiry “with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number
of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (PLCM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) From there, the “lodestar
figure may then be adjusted [according to a multiplier enhancement] based on
consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided.” (Id.) Relevant
multiplier factors include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions
involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which
the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, [and]
(4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24
Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)
 
No
specific findings reflecting the court’s calculations for attorney’s fees are
required; the record need only show that the attorney’s fees were awarded
according to the “lodestar” or “touchstone” approach. (Rebney v. Wells Fargo
Bank (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1344, 1349.) A trial court has broad discretion
to award attorney fees in an amount that is less than the lodestar amount and,
to discourage claimants from making an unreasonable demand, may deny altogether
a fee request that appears unreasonably inflated. (Id. at 1321-1322; see
Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635.)
 
“The
basis for the trial court's calculation must be the actual hours counsel has
devoted to the case, less those that result from inefficient or duplicative use
of time.” (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State University
(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 395.) “The law is clear, however, that an award of
attorney fees may be based on counsel's declarations, without production of
detailed time records.” (Raining Data Corp. v. Barrenechea (2009) 175
Cal.App.4th 1363, 1375.) 
 
“In
challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are
claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific
items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.
General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do
not suffice. Failure to raise specific challenges in the trial court forfeits
the claim on appeal.” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th
459, 488.)
 
MERITS: 
 
Caltrans
moves for attorney’s fees to be awarded in the amount of $42,075.00. This
amount reflects a total of 153.8 hours of attorney work at a rate of $250 per
hour. Caltrans requests that this amount, in addition to $12,198.55 of
undisputed costs (reflected in a separately filed Memorandum of Costs) be added
to the judgment. 
 
As a
preliminary matter, the Court finds that Caltrans is the prevailing party in
the matter. C.C.P. § 1032(a)(4) defines a prevailing party as one with a net
monetary recovery. There is no doubt that Caltrans is the prevailing party in
this litigation under that definition. The Court also finds that the written
lease agreement between the parties allows Caltrans to seek attorney’s fees in
this unlawful detainer matter. The attorney fees provision of the lease
agreement is as follows: 
 
If Tenant or Landlord shall bring any action for
any relief against the other, declaratory or otherwise, arising out of this
Lease, including any suit by Landlord for the recovery of rent or possession of
the premises, the losing party shall pay the successful party a reasonable sum
for attorney’s fees which shall be deemed to have accrued on the commencement
of such action and shall be paid whether or not such action is prosecuted to
judgment. Should Landlord, without fault on Landlord’s part, be made a party to
any litigation instituted by Tenant or by any third party against Tenant, or by
or against any person holding under or using the premises by license of Tenant,
or for the foreclosure of any lien for labor or materials furnished to or for
Tenant or any such other person or otherwise arising out of or resulting from
any act or transaction of Tenant or of any such other person, Tenant shall save
and hold Landlord harmless from any judgment rendered against Landlord or the
premises or any part thereof, and all costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorney’s fees, incurred by Landlord in connection with such litigation.” 
 
(Choi
Decl. ¶ 39, Ex. 1 at Article 19.5, p. 40.)
 
Given
this suit was for the recovery of possession and past due rent, the attorney’s
fee provision is clearly triggered. 
 
As
concerns the amount of fees requested, the Court finds them to be reasonable. “[T]he
verified time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are
entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are
erroneous.” (Horsford, supra at 396; City of Colton v. Singletary
(2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 751, 785.) 
 
The
underlying matter was vigorously contested which resulted in significant
litigation.  Here, Caltrans presents
uncontested records as to the number of hours spent on the case. The billable
hours timesheets, submitted as Exhibits 6 and 7 to the declaration of Daniel
Choi (Choi), reflect a total of 153.8 hours spent litigating this matter. In
the Court’s experience this number of hours is commensurate with the complexity
of a commercial unlawful detainer case. Further, the Court does not find
anything about the billable hours entries to be clearly erroneous. In short,
the number of hours billed is reasonably supported by Caltrans’ uncontested
declarations and documentary evidence. 
 
As
concerns the rate of Caltrans’ attorneys, the Court finds this to is
reasonable. Caltrans states that, although it does not bill hourly, it could
reasonably bill $250 per hour. (Choi Decl. ¶ 45.) Choi states that he is a
practicing attorney with roughly eleven years of experience and that his rate
in private practice prior to joining Caltrans was $400 an hour. (Choi Decl. ¶¶
41, 42.) Choi additionally supports his rate by providing copies of the United
States Attorney’s Office Fee Matrix and the Laffey Matrix. (Choi Decl. Exhs. 4,
5.) Both matrices indicate a rate higher than $250 per hour for an attorney of
Choi’s experience. As such, the Court finds Choi’s rates reasonable. 
 
The Court
notes that Caltrans does not request a multiplier of the lodestar amount. The
Court also notes that there is a slight discrepancy in Caltrans’ accounting and
their requested fee amount. Although Caltrans requests fees of $42,075, their
billing entries show a total of $41,075 (38,450 + 2,625 = 41,075). (See Choi
Decl. Exh. 6, 7.) The Court finds that $41,075 is the proper amount supported
by Caltrans’ declaration and evidence. 
 
As
concerns Caltrans’ memorandum of costs, the Court finds it too is appropriate. If
items on their face appear to be proper charges, the verified memorandum of
costs is prima facie evidence of their propriety, and the burden is on the
party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary. (Ladas
v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.) Here,
Caltrans submitted a separate Memorandum of Costs within 15 days of entry of
judgment as required by Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700(a)(1). Upon review the
Court finds the charges to be proper. Further, Apex did not bring a
corresponding motion to tax any of these costs within the 15-day time limit
proscribed by Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700(b)(1). As such, the cost award
of $12,198.55 is appropriate. 
 
In sum,
the Court finds Caltrans has shown it is entitled to attorney’s fees in the
amount of $41,075 and costs in the amount of $12,198.55. Caltrans has
adequately demonstrated the reasonableness of these fees and costs, while Apex
has submitted no opposition. Accordingly, Caltrans’ motion for attorney’s fees
is GRANTED.
