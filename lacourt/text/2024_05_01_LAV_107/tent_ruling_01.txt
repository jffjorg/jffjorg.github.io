COURT’S [TENTATIVE] RULING RE: 
Confirm
  Arbitration Award



[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]:
 
THE MOTION IS GRANTED. 
 
I. BACKGROUND
On July 19, 2021,
plaintiff Azalea Zamora (“Plaintiff’) and defendant WHN, Inc., dba Porsche
Woodland Hills (the “Dealer”) entered into a sale agreement (the “Agreement”) whereby
Plaintiff purchased a used vehicle from the Dealer. (Motion p. 2.)
 
On March 8, 2022,
Plaintiff initiated this lawsuit by filing a complaint against the Dealer and
defendant Mercedes-Benz U.S.A., LLC (“Defendant”) alleging causes of action for
breaches of express and implied warranties under the Song-Beverley Consumer
Warranty Act and for negligence. 
 
On April 11, 2022,
Defendant moved to compel arbitration, which motion was granted on June 21,
2022.
 
On February 29,
2024, the arbitrator granted summary judgment to Defendant on all of
Plaintiff’s claims and rendered a final award (the “Award”) in favor of
Defendant and against Plaintiff. (Motion
Attachment 8(c).)
 
On March 5, 2024, Defendant
filed a petition to confirm arbitration award, which was denied on March 29,
2024.
 
On April 3, 2024,
Defendant filed another petition to confirm arbitration award (the “Motion”). Plaintiff
does not oppose the Motion.
 
II. MOVING PARTY’S POSITION
 
Defendant requests that the court confirm the Award and enter judgment
according to it.  (Motion p. 3.) Defendant
attaches to the Motion a copy of the Agreement, which includes a provision to
arbitrate “any claim or dispute between the parties which arises out of or
relates to credit application, purchase or condition of vehicle, [the
Agreement] or resulting transaction or relationship.” (Motion Attachment 4(b).)
Plaintiff alleged “violations of the Beverly-Song Consumer Warranty Act and the
Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.” (Motion p. 2.) Defendant attaches to the Motion a
copy of the Award, which requires neither party to pay the other anything.
(Motion Attachment 8(c).)
 
III. ANALYSIS
 
“Any party to an
arbitration in which an award has been made may petition the court to confirm,
correct or vacate the award.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.) Such a petition must
set forth the substance, or attach copies of: the arbitration agreement, award,
and any written opinion. (Id. at § 1285.4.) It must be served between ten
days and four years from the date the award was served on the petitioner. (Id.
at §§ 1288 & 1288.4.) The other party may respond to the petition. (Id.
at § 1285.2.) 
 
“If a petition or
response under this chapter is duly served and filed, the court shall confirm
the award as made, whether rendered in this state or another state, unless in
accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and confirms it as
corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1286.) The
court may not vacate or correct an award unless a petition or response
requesting that the award be vacated or corrected has been duly served and
filed. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1286.4 & 1286.8.) “If an award is confirmed,
judgment shall be entered in conformity therewith.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
1287.4.) 
 
Here, the Motion correctly
attached copies of the Agreement with the arbitration provision and the Award.
The Award was made and served on Plaintiff on February 29, 2024. This Motion,
which was filed on April 3, 2024 was therefore filed and served between ten
days and four years from the date the Award was served on Plaintiff. No motion
to vacate or correct the Award having been filed, this court shall confirm the
Award as made and enter judgment in conformity therewith.
 
Accordingly, this
court GRANTS the Motion.
