And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motions to compel further responses to form interrogatories and requests for admissions. The plaintiff has failed to provide sufficient responses to discovery requests, including requests for admissions and form interrogatories. The court has ordered the plaintiff to provide further responses to these requests, including providing specific information about their medical records and the names of any medical providers who have knowledge of the facts related to the accident. The court has also ordered the plaintiff to pay monetary sanctions for their failure to comply with discovery requests.

The court has overruled the plaintiff's objections to the defendant's motions to compel, finding that the plaintiff has not shown that the requests are vague or ambiguous, or that they require expert opinion. The court has also found that the plaintiff's responses to the requests do not meet the requirements of the California Code of Civil Procedure.

The court has set a hearing date for February 23, 2024, to consider the motions to compel further responses.
