Discussion
Two related cases arise out of a multi-vehicle automobile
accident on July 6, 2019, near the Adams Exit on the 101 North Freeway in Los
Angeles.
In Case No. 21STCV23847 (the “Marinero Action”), Plaintiffs
Luis Felix Marinero, Ana Rodriguez, and Nathaly Rodriguez filed a complaint on
June 28, 2021, asserting causes of action for negligence and negligence per se
against Defendant Angelica Biana Diaz (“Diaz”) and Does 1 through 25.  Diaz
filed her answer on August 20, 2021.
In Case No. 21STCV24492 (the “Smith Action”), Plaintiff
Lloyd Smith filed a complaint on July 1, 2021, asserting a cause of action for
negligence against Defendants Diaz, Luis Rodriguez, and Does 1 through 50.  On February 1, 2023, Diaz and Luis Rodriguez
each filed their answers.  Diaz and Luis Rodriguez each filed
Cross-Complaints as well.
On March 15, 2023, the Court determined that the Marinero
Action and the Smith Action are related cases.
Currently before the Court in the Smith Action are four motions.
The first three motions were filed by Defendant Luis
Rodriguez on March 29, 2023, to compel Plaintiff Smith to provide initial
responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One),
and Requests for Production (Set One). 
These motions were initially set for hearing on January 30, 2024.  
On January 30, 2024, the Court noted that subsequent to the
filing of the motions: (1) Defendant Luis Rodriguez and Plaintiff Smith
settled; (2) Plaintiff Smith dismissed all claims against Defendant Luis Rodriguez;
and (3) Defendant Luis Rodriguez filed a motion for a determination of good
faith settlement, which is set to be heard on March 22, 2024.  Counsel informed the Court that the discovery
motions may be affected by the outcome of the hearing on the good faith motion;
the Court noted that the parties may file an ex parte application to advance the
hearing on the good faith motion and continued all three hearings to February
23, 2024.
The fourth motion was filed by Defendant Luis Rodriguez on December
15, 2023, for an order against Plaintiff Smith deeming admitted the truth of
the matters specified in Requests for Admission (Set One).  
Based upon the information before the Court, it appears
that all four of these discovery motions may be affected by the Court’s ruling
on the pending good faith motion.
Accordingly, the Court, on its own motion, continues the
hearing on these discovery motions for approximately sixty days.
The Court notes that there is a pending motion to
consolidate this case with the Marinero Action. 
If that motion is granted, all future hearings will be on calendar in
the Marinero Action (Case No. 21STCV23847)
Moving party to give notice.
