  Case Number:  19STCV15141    Hearing Date:   February 23, 2024    Dept:  29 The
Court will hear from counsel.
 
Generally, the so-called “Sidewalk
Accident Doctrine” provides that abutting property owners have no duty to
members of the public in tort law, and are not liable to members of the public,
unless the property owner created the defect or exercised dominion or control
over the abutting sidewalk. (Lopez v. City of Los Angeles (2020) 55
Cal.App.5th 244, 255.)
 
But
where the property owner created or contributed to the dangerous condition, the
property owner may be liable. For example, in Alpert v. Villa Romano
Homeowners Assn. (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 1320,1335, there was evidence that defendant
planted and maintained vegetation on both sides of a sidewalk, which grew roots
which caused the sidewalk to be uplifted and crack, creating or contributing to
the dangerous condition.
 
Plaintiff submits the declaration of Guy
Stivers, a registered landscape architect and certified arborist, who states that
through his investigation, he found roots from a myrtle hedge leading to the
sidewalk less than four feet away from the defect, and a tree planted in the
parkway approximately 18 feet north of the defect. (Declaration of Guy Stivers,
¶ 6.) Mr. Stivers opines that defect in the sidewalk was caused by the root
from the myrtle hedge growing on Moving Party’s property and not the tree in
the parkway. (Id., ¶ 13.)
Defendant objects to this testimony. But if the
Court overrules the objections, does Mr. Stivers’s testimony create a triable
issue of fact regarding whether the property owner created or contributed to
the dangerous condition?
