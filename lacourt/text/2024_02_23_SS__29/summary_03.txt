Summary in English text:
This tentative ruling grants Defendant Angelica Biana Diaz's motion to consolidate the Marinero Action and the Smith Action for all purposes, and also grants her motion for leave to file an amended answer. The cases arise out of the same multi-vehicle accident on July 6, 2019, and there are common parties and common questions of law and fact. The Court finds that consolidation for all purposes will promote judicial economy and avoid duplicative discovery and trial proceedings, and that no party would suffer any unfair or undue prejudice from consolidation. The motion to consolidate is GRANTED, and the Marinero Action (Case No. 21STCV23847) is designated as the lead case. The motion for leave to file an amended answer is also GRANTED, and Counsel for Diaz is directed to give notice to all parties in both cases.
