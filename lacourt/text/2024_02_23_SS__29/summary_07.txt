  - "A party must include in its initial exchange 'every witness it expects to call at trial' but need not also list 'every expert witness it anticipates using to rebut the experts the other wise might designate as an expert'."

And here is the summary in English:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to strike Defendant's supplemental expert designation is denied. The case involves a slip and fall incident that occurred on October 2, 2019, and the parties have been exchanging expert witness information. Defendant disclosed one expert witness, SangDo Park, and Plaintiff disclosed three expert witnesses, Stepan Kasimian, Mark Burns, and Neil Ghodadra. Defendant later filed a supplemental designation of expert witnesses, which included a new expert witness, Alex J. Balian. Plaintiff filed a motion to strike this supplemental designation, arguing that it was improper. The judge considered the late-filed opposition and exercised its discretion to consider it. The judge found that Defendant's supplemental designation was proper and did not unfairly prejudice Plaintiff.
