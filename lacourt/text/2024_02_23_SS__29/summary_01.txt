```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is based on information presented before the hearing. The case involves a sidewalk accident, and the Judge is considering whether the property owner is liable. The "Sidewalk Accident Doctrine" states that abutting property owners have no duty to the public unless they created the defect or exercised control over the sidewalk. However, if the property owner created or contributed to the dangerous condition, they may be liable. The Judge is considering expert testimony from Guy Stivers, a registered landscape architect and certified arborist, who opines that the defect was caused by roots from a myrtle hedge on the defendant's property, not a tree in the parkway. The defendant objects to this testimony, but the Judge is considering whether it creates a triable issue of fact regarding the defendant's liability. The Judge will hear from counsel at the hearing on February 23, 2024.
