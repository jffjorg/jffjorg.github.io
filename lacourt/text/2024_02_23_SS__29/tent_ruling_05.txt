 Case Number:  21STCV26077    Hearing Date:   February 23, 2024    Dept:  29 Plaintiff’s motion for issue, evidence, and terminating
sanctions.
The Court will hear from counsel.
The Court is particularly interested in addressing, first, whether
the discovery responses provided on January 15 are in compliance with the Code
and the Court’s prior orders.  The Court
expects counsel to be prepared to address this issue with specificity, and, as necessary, on a response-by-response basis.
Second, the Court would like counsel to address the issue of
what sanctions are appropriate if the responses are not in compliance with the
Code and the Court’s prior orders.
