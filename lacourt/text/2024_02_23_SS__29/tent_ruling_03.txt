Defendant’s motion for leave to file amended answer.
Tentative
The motion to consolidate is granted.
The motion for leave to file amended answer is granted.
Background
Two related cases arise out of a multi-vehicle automobile
accident on July 6, 2019, near the Adams Exit on the 101 North Freeway in Los
Angeles.
In Case No. 21STCV23847 (the “Marinero Action”), Plaintiffs
Luis Felix Marinero, Ana Rodriguez, and Nathaly Rodriguez filed a complaint on
June 28, 2021, asserting causes of action for negligence and negligence per se
against Defendant Angelica Biana Diaz (“Diaz”) and Does 1 through 25.  Diaz
filed her answer on August 20, 2021.
In Case No. 21STCV24492 (the “Smith Action”), Plaintiff
Lloyd Smith filed a complaint on July 1, 2021, asserting a cause of action for
negligence against Defendants Diaz, Luis Rodriguez, and Does 1 through 50.  On February 1, 2023, Diaz and Luis Rodriguez
each filed their answers.  Diaz and Luis Rodriguez each filed
Cross-Complaints as well.
On March 15, 2023, the Court determined that the Marinero
Action and the Smith Action are related cases.
Currently before the Court in the Marinero Action are two
motions.
The first is a motion filed by Diaz on March 27, 2023, to
consolidate the Marinero Action and the Smith Action.  This motion was previously heard by the Court
on January 22, 2024, and was continued to February 23 so that the moving party
could address a procedural oversight in the moving papers.  The motion was then refiled in both cases on
January 22, 2024.  No opposition has been
filed.
The second is a motion filed by Diaz on April 7, 2023, for
leave to amend her answer.  No opposition
has been filed.
Currently before the Court in the Smith Action are four
additional motions.  Those motions are
addressed in a separate document.
Legal Standard
Motion to Consolidate
“When actions involving a
common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a
joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it
may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders concerning
proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1048, subd. (a).)  The purpose of consolidation is to enhance
trial court efficiency by avoiding unnecessary duplication of evidence and the
danger of inconsistent adjudications.  (See
Todd-Stenberg v. Dalkon Shield Claimants Trust (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 976,
978-979.) 
There are two types of consolidation: a complete consolidation for all
purposes, and a more limited consolidation for trial or certain other specific
purposes (such as pre-trial discovery). 
(Hamilton v. Asbestos Corp., Ltd. (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1127, 1147; Sanchez v. Super.
Ct. (1988) 203
Cal.App.3d 1391, 1396; see also 3 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure Before Trial (2023), ¶¶ 12:340-341.3.)  When cases are consolidated for all purposes,
“the two actions are merged into a single proceeding under one case number and
result in only one verdict or set of findings and one judgment.”  (Hamilton,
supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1147; see also Sanchez,
supra, 203 Cal.App.3d at p. 1396.)  In a
consolidation for limited purposes, “the two actions remain otherwise separate.”  (Hamilton,
supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1147; see also Sanchez,
supra, 203 Cal.App.3d at p. 1396.)  
“Consolidation under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1048 is permissive, and it is for the trial court to
determine whether the consolidation is for all purposes or for trial only.” (Hamilton, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1149.) 
There are a number of special
procedural requirements for a motion to consolidate.  Such a motion must (among other things): “(A)
List all named parties in each case, the names of those who have appeared, and
the names of their respective attorneys of record; (B) Contain the captions of
all the cases sought to be consolidated; with the lowest numbered case shown
first; and (C) Be filed in each case sought to be consolidated.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.350, subd.
(a)(1).)  The motion must be “served on
all attorneys of record and all nonrepresented parties in all of the cases
sought to be consolidated.”  (Id.,
subd. (a)(2)(B).)  And before the motion
is heard, the cases must all be assigned to the same department.  (Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule 3.3,
subd. (g)(1) [“A motion to consolidate two or more cases may be noticed and
heard after the cases, initially filed in different departments, have been
related into a single department, or if the cases were already assigned to that
department.”].)
Motion for Leave to Amend Answer
“The court may …, in its discretion,
after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an
amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars ….” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).)  
“[T]he court’s discretion will usually
be exercised liberally to permit amendment of the pleadings.”  (Howard v. County of San Diego (2010)
184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428.) “If the motion to amend is timely made and the
granting of the motion will not prejudice the opposing party, it is error to
refuse permission to amend and where the refusal also results in a party being
deprived of the right to assert a meritorious cause of action or a meritorious
defense, it is not only error but an abuse of discretion.” (Morgan v.
Superior Court of Cal. in and for Los Angeles County (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d
527, 530; see also Higgins v. Del Faro (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 558, 564 [“Where
no prejudice is shown to the adverse party, the liberal rule of allowance
prevails”].)  Absent prejudice to the
opposing party, delay in requesting the amendment is not grounds for denial of
leave to amend. (See, e.g., Arthur L. Sachs, Inc. v. City of Oceanside
(1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 315, 324 (denial of leave to amend on the eve of trial
was error absent a showing a prejudice); Higgins v. Del Faro, supra,
123 Cal.App.3d at pp. 565–566 (same).)
There are a number of special procedural requirements for a
motion for leave to amend a pleading.  Such
a motion must (among other things): 
(1)  “Include
a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading”;
(2)  “State
what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted”; and
(3)  “State
what allegations are proposed to be added to the previous pleading.”
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(a).)  In addition, a declaration must accompany the
motion and specify:
(1)  “The
effect of the amendment”;
(2)  “Why
the amendment is necessary and proper”;
(3)  “When
the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered”; and
(4)  “The
reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier.”
(Id., subd. (b).)
Discussion
Motion to Consolidate
Defendant Diaz seeks to consolidate the Marinero Action and
the Smith Action for all purposes.  Diaz
argues that the cases arise out of the same multi-vehicle accident on July 6,
2019; that there are common parties and common questions of law and fact,
including issues relating to liability and comparative negligence; that
consolidation for all purposes will promote judicial economy and avoid
duplicative discovery and trial proceedings; and that no party would suffer any
unfair or undue prejudice from consolidation.
No party has filed any opposition to the motion.
The Court has reviewed the moving papers and finds that all substantive
and procedural requirements have been satisfied.  Diaz has shown good cause for a complete
consolidation for all purposes of the Marinero Action and the Smith Action
under Code of Civil Procedure section 1048. 
The motion is GRANTED.
Motion for Leave to Amend Answer
Defendant Diaz seeks leave to file an amended Answer in the
Marinero Action to add certain affirmative defenses.  Diaz argues that there is a strong judicial
policy in favor of allowing amended pleadings so that disputes may be resolved
on the merits and that no party would suffer any unfair or undue prejudice from
allowing the amendment.
No party has filed any opposition to the motion.
The Court has reviewed the moving papers and finds that all substantive
and procedural requirements have been satisfied.  Diaz has shown good cause for leave to amend.
The motion is GRANTED.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS Diaz’s motion to consolidate the Marinero
Action and the Smith Action.  The
Marinero Action (Case No. 21STCV23847) is the lead case.
The
Court GRANTS Diaz’s motion for leave to file her amended answer (attached to
the moving papers) within 10 days.
Counsel
for Diaz to give notice to all parties in both cases.
