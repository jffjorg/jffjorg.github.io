 Case Number:  20STCV36044    Hearing Date:   February 23, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant’s Motion to Compel Further Response to Form
Interrogatories
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Admission 
Tentative
The motions to compel are granted.
The requests for sanctions are granted in part.
Background
This case arises out of an alleged motor vehicle accident on
October 8, 2019, near the intersection of Bledsoe Street and Foothill Boulevard
in Los Angeles.  On September 21, 2020,
Plaintiffs Laura Alcaraz and Laura Elisa Rodriguez (by and through her guardian
ad litem Laura Alcaraz) filed the Complaint in this action against Defendant
Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“MTA”) and Does 1
through 50, asserting causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and general
negligence.  MTA filed its Answer on
November 20, 2020.
On June 13, 2023, MTA served Plaintiff Laura Elisa Rodriguez
(“Plaintiff”) with discovery, including Requests for Admission (“RFAs”) (Set
One) and Form Interrogatories (Set Two). 
(Adelpour Decls., ¶ 1 & Exhs. A.) 
Plaintiff responded and then, following further discussions regarding
the alleged inadequacy of the responses, Plaintiff agreed to provide further
responses by August 24, 2023.  (Id.,
¶ 2.)  A further extension was also
provided.  (Ibid.)  No further responses were ever provided, and
an Informal Discovery Conference did not resolve the issues.  (Id., ¶¶ 3-7.)
On December 20, 2023, MTA filed these two motions to compel
further responses.  MTA also seeks
monetary sanctions.  Plaintiff filed her
oppositions on February 9, and MTA filed its replies on February 13.
Legal Standard
“On receipt of a response to requests for admissions, the
party requesting admissions may move for an order compelling a further response
if that party deems that either or both of the following apply: (1) An answer
to a particular request is evasive or incomplete. (2) An objection to a
particular request is without merit or too general.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd.
(a).)
Notice of a motion to compel further responses must be given
“within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental
verified response, or any specific later date to which the requesting party and
the responding party have agreed in writing.” (Id., subd. (c).)
A motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a meet-and-confer
declaration and a separate statement or, in the discretion of the Court, a
“concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.” (Id.,
subd. (b)(1) & (b)(2); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345.)
“The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel further response, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (d).)
“On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding
party deems that any of the following apply: (1) An answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. (2) An exercise of the option to
produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required
specification of those documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)
Notice of a motion to compel further responses must be given
“within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental
verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the
propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing.” (Id.,
subd. (c).)
A motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a meet-and-confer
declaration and a separate statement or, in the discretion of the Court, a
“concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.” (Id.,
subd. (b)(1) & (b)(2); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345.)
“The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).)
In Chapter 7 of the
Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a)
provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that any person “engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any
attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” A “misuse of
the discovery process” includes (among other things) failing to respond or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery; making, without substantial
justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an evasive
response to a discovery request; disobeying a court order to provide discovery;
and making or opposing, unsuccessfully, a motion to compel without substantial
justification. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d)-(h).)
Discussion
RFAs
MTA moves to compel further responses to RFAs Nos. 5-11, 20,
and 23.
RFA Nos. 5-10 ask Plaintiff to admit that her complaint of hip
pain, lower back pain, left leg pain, right shoulder pain, right arm pain, and
right hand pain predated the accident.  
Plaintiff objects to each RFA on the ground that it “requires
an expert opinion,” that it seeks information protected by the attorney-client
privilege and work product doctrine, and that it is vague and unambiguous.  Plaintiff then states, without waiving these
objections, that she “cannot admit or deny.”
Plaintiff’s objections are OVERRULED.
Plaintiff’s statement that she cannot admit or deny whether
she had pain in certain parts of her body before the accident is a peculiar
response, particularly given that it appears (from the application for
appointment of a guardian ad litem, which the Court granted) that Plaintiff was
an adult at the time of the accident with a variety of medical challenges and
should be able to state what pain she had in various parts of her body prior to
the accident.  In any event, the
responses do not meet the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section
2033.220, subdivision (c).  
The motion to compel further responses to RFA Nos. 5-10 is
GRANTED.
RFA No. 11 asks Plaintiff to admit that she did not injure her
lower back in the accident.
Plaintiff objects to this RFA on the ground that it “requires
an expert opinion,” that it seeks information protected by the attorney-client
privilege and work product doctrine, and that it is vague and unambiguous.  Plaintiff then states, without waiving these
objections, that she “cannot admit or deny.”
Plaintiff’s objections are OVERRULED.  The fact that a particular area of inquiry in
discovery may be the subject of expert opinion at a later stage of the case
does not relieve a party of providing all information known to the party
regarding that area of inquiry at the time of the response.
Plaintiff’s statement that she cannot admit or deny whether
she injured her lower back in an accident is a peculiar response, as an adult
(even one with serious medical issues) should be able to state whether she
believes that an accident caused an injury to her body.  In any event, the responses do not meet the
requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220, subdivision (c).  
The motion to compel a further response to RFA No. 11 is
GRANTED.
RFA No. 20 asks Plaintiff to admit that her hip fracture
healed by October 20, 2020.
Plaintiff objects to this RFA on the ground that it “requires
an expert opinion,” that it seeks information protected by the attorney-client
privilege and work product doctrine, and that it is vague and unambiguous.  Plaintiff then states, without waiving these
objections, that she “cannot admit or deny.”
Plaintiff’s objections are OVERRULED.  The fact that a particular area of inquiry in
discovery may be the subject of expert opinion at a later stage of the case
does not relieve a party of providing all information known to the party
regarding that area of inquiry at the time of the response.
Plaintiff’s statement that she cannot admit or deny whether
her hip fracture healed by October 20, 2020 is a peculiar response, as an adult
(even one with serious medical issues) should be able to state whether she
believes that a hip fracture was or was not healed by a certain date.  In any event, the responses do not meet the
requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220, subdivision (c).  
The motion to compel a further response to RFA No. 20 is
GRANTED.
RFA No. 23 asks Plaintiff to admit that her pelvis was
“non-tender” on October 8, 2019, after the accident.
Plaintiff objects to this RFA on the ground that it “requires
an expert opinion,” that it seeks information protected by the attorney-client
privilege and work product doctrine, and that it is vague and unambiguous.  Plaintiff then states, without waiving these
objections, that she “cannot admit or deny.”
Plaintiff’s objections are OVERRULED.  The fact that a particular area of inquiry in
discovery may be the subject of expert opinion at a later stage of the case
does not relieve a party of providing all information known to the party
regarding that area of inquiry at the time of the response.
Plaintiff’s statement that she cannot admit or deny whether
her pelvis was or was not “non-tender” after the accident is a peculiar
response, as an adult (even one with serious medical issues) should be able to
state whether her pelvis was or was not “non-tender” after an accident.  In any event, the responses do not meet the
requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220, subdivision (c).  
The motion to compel a further response to RFA No. 23 is
GRANTED.
Form Interrogatory 17.1
MTA moves to compel further responses to Form Interrogatory
No. 17.1, as it relates to RFAs Nos. 1-24. 
Complicating the issues here is the fact that Plaintiff grouped the responses,
rather than setting out the response to Form Interrogatory 17.1 for each RFA
separately, but, regardless, the Court will analyze the response for each RFA
separately.
·        
RFA No. 1.
The response to subpart (b) is factual and code compliant.
The response to subpart (c) contains non-responsive
information in the first sentence, but the second sentence is responsive and
code compliant.
The response to subpart (d) is not code compliant.  The reference to “All … medical records,”
produced or not produced, is not a “complete and straightforward” answer, as
required by Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.220, and does not adequately
identify each person who has each document. 
Moreover, Plaintiff’s medical records are not responsive to
interrogatory, which relates to whether MTA was negligent.
The motion to compel a further response to Form Interrogatory
17.1 as it relates to RFA No. 1 is granted as to subpart (d).
·        
RFA No. 2.
The response to subpart (b) contains non-responsive
information and is not code compliant.
The response to subpart (c) contains non-responsive
information in the first sentence, but the second sentence is responsive and
code compliant.
The response to subpart (d) is not code compliant.  The reference to “All … medical records,”
produced or not produced, is not a “complete and straightforward” answer, as
required by Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.220, and does not adequately
identify each person who has each document. 
Moreover, Plaintiff’s medical records are not responsive to
interrogatory, which relates to whether Plaintiff was contributorily negligent.
The motion to compel a further response to Form Interrogatory
17.1 as it relates to RFA No. 2 is granted as to subparts (b) and (d).
·        
RFA No. 3.
The response to subpart (b) is factual and code compliant.
The response to subpart (c) contains non-responsive
information in the first sentence, but the second sentence is responsive and
code compliant.
The response to subpart (d) is not code compliant.  The reference to “All … medical records,”
produced or not produced, is not a “complete and straightforward” answer, as
required by Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.220, and does not adequately
identify each person who has each document. 
Moreover, Plaintiff’s medical records are not responsive to
interrogatory, which relates to whether Plaintiff was solely negligent.
The motion to compel a further response to Form Interrogatory
17.1 as it relates to RFA No. 3 is granted as to subpart (d).
·        
RFA No. 4.
The response to subpart (b) contains non-responsive
information and is not code compliant.
The response to subpart (c) contains non-responsive
information in the first sentence, but the second sentence is responsive and
code compliant.
The response to subpart (d) is not code compliant.  The reference to “All … medical records,”
produced or not produced, is not a “complete and straightforward” answer, as
required by Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.220, and does not adequately
identify each person who has each document. 
Moreover, Plaintiff’s medical records are not responsive to
interrogatory, which relates to whether Plaintiff was offered securement by the
bus operator.
The motion to compel a further response to Form Interrogatory
17.1 as it relates to RFA No. 4 is granted as to subparts (b) and (d).
·        
RFA No. 5.
Plaintiff objects to the interrogatory as it relates to this
RFA on the ground that it “requires an expert opinion,” that it seeks
information protected by the attorney-client privilege and work product
doctrine, and that it is vague and unambiguous. 

Plaintiff’s objections are OVERRULED.  The fact that a particular area of inquiry in
discovery may be the subject of expert opinion at a later stage of the case
does not relieve a party of providing all information known to the party
regarding that area of inquiry at the time of the response.
The motion to compel a further response to Form Interrogatory
17.1 as it relates to RFA No. 5 is granted.
·        
RFA No. 6.
Plaintiff objects to the interrogatory as it relates to this
RFA on the ground that it “requires an expert opinion,” that it seeks
information protected by the attorney-client privilege and work product
doctrine, and that it is vague and unambiguous. 

Plaintiff’s objections are OVERRULED.  The fact that a particular area of inquiry in
discovery may be the subject of expert opinion at a later stage of the case
does not relieve a party of providing all information known to the party
regarding that area of inquiry at the time of the response.

17.1 as it relates to RFA No. 6 is granted.

RFA on the ground that it “requires an expert opinion,” that it seeks
information protected by the attorney-client privilege and work product
doctrine, and that it is vague and unambiguous. 

Plaintiff’s objections are OVERRULED.  The fact that a particular area of inquiry in
discovery may be the subject of expert opinion at a later stage of the case
does not relieve a party of providing all information known to the party
regarding that area of inquiry at the time of the response.
The motion to compel a further response to Form Interrogatory
17.1 as it relates to RFA No. 7 is granted.
·

discovery may be the subject of expert opinion at a later stage of the case
does not relieve a party of providing all information known to the party
regarding that area of inquiry at the time of the response.
The motion to compel a further response to Form Interrogatory
17.1 as it relates to RFA No. 8 is granted.
·        
RFA No. 9.
Plaintiff objects to the interrogatory as it relates to this
RFA on the ground that it “requires an expert opinion,” that it seeks
information protected by the attorney-client privilege and work product
doctrine, and that it is vague and unambiguous. 

Plaintiff’s objections are OVERRULED.  The fact that a particular area of inquiry in
discovery may be the subject of expert opinion at a later stage of the case

discovery may be the subject of expert opinion at a later stage of the case
does not relieve a party of providing all information known to the party
regarding that area of inquiry at the time of the response.

does not relieve a party of providing all information known to the party
regarding that area of inquiry at the time of the response.
The motion to compel a further response to Form Interrogatory
17.1 as it relates to RFA No. 11 is granted.
·        
RFA No. 12.
The response to subpart (b) contains non-responsive
information and is not code compliant.
The response to subpart (c) contains non-responsive
information in the first sentence, but the second sentence is responsive and
