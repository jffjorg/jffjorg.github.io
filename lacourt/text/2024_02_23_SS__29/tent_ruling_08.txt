Tentative
 
The motion is denied without prejudice.
 
Background
On September 30,
2022, Plaintiff Emily Givhan (“Plaintiff”) filed her complaint against Food 4
Less of California Inc., dba Food 4 Less, Katrina Hernandez, and Does 1 through
100 for Negligence and Premises Liability for injuries Plaintiff alleged sustained
on October 6, 2021.  
 
On October 19,
2022, Defendant Alpha Beta Company dba Food 4 Less (erroneously sued as Food 4
Less of California Inc., dba Food 4 Less) (“Defendant”) filed its answer.  On that same day, Defendant served Plaintiff
with Form Interrogatories (Set One.) (Breitburg Decl., Exh. A.)
 
On June 16,
2023, the Court granted the motion of Plaintiff’s attorney of record to be relieved
as counsel.
 
Plaintiff did
not respond to the interrogatories. 
(Breitburg Decl., ¶ 3.)
 
On January
26, 2024, Defendant filed the Motion
to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Form Interrogatories (Set No. One).  Plaintiff was served by email only.
 
No
opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.020, subd. (a).)
“[P]roviding untimely responses does not divest the
trial court of its authority [to hear a motion to compel responses].”  (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.,
supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.)  Even
if the untimely response “does not contain objections [and] substantially
resolve[s] the issues raised by a motion to compel responses … the trial court
retains the authority to hear the motion.”¿ (Id. at pp. 408-409.)¿ This rule gives “an important incentive for parties to
respond to discovery in a timely fashion.”¿ (Id. at p. 408.)¿ If “the propounding party [does not] take the motion off
calendar or narrow its scope to the issue of sanctions,”
the trial court may “deny the motion to compel responses as essentially
unnecessary, in whole or in part, and just impose sanctions.”¿ (Id. at p. 409.) “The court may award sanctions
under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel
discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to
the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving
party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).)  
Discussion
Defendant served
Plaintiff on October 19, 2022, with Form Interrogatories (Set One.) (Breitburg
Decl., Exh. A.) Plaintiff has not responded. (Id., ¶ 3.)
 
Defendant filed this motion and served Plaintiff, who is
representing herself in pro per, by email only. 
Although email service may be mandatory for represented parties,
litigants who are in pro per are not subject to mandatory email service, and
Defendant has presented no evidence that Plaintiff has consented to email
service.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6,
subd. (c)(2); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.251(c)(3)(B).)
Accordingly, the motion to compel was not properly served
and is denied without prejudice.
 
Conclusion
The Court DENIES Defendant’s motion to compel without prejudice.
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
