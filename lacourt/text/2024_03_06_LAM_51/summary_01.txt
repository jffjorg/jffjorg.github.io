And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by Kia America, Inc. against Samuel Linder. The demurrer is filed against the fourth cause of action, which alleges fraud and misrepresentation by Kia. The judge sustains the demurrer, finding that the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. The judge also grants the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages, as the complaint does not sufficiently plead that Kia acted with malice, fraud, or oppression.

The judge notes that the plaintiff failed to file an opposition to the demurrer and motion to strike, and therefore did not demonstrate that he could cure any defects in the complaint. The judge denies leave to amend the complaint, finding that it is unlikely that the plaintiff could amend the complaint in a way that would address the deficiencies identified in the demurrer and motion to strike.

The hearing on this matter is set for March 6, 2024.
