And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the motion by Doctor Laser Medical, Inc., Dr. Laser Medspa, PC, Dr. Laser, LLC, and Joseph Campana (Defendants) to enforce the settlement agreement between them and Jonathan Eagen (Plaintiff). The parties entered into an oral settlement agreement on March 18, 2024, which was read into the record. The agreement provided that Plaintiff would dismiss all Defendants with prejudice, provide a general release of all Defendants, and pay $2,500 in fees and costs, while Defendants would waive fees and costs in excess of $2,500. The Court found that the parties had explicitly defined the terms of the agreement, questioned the parties regarding their understanding, and acknowledged their understanding, making the agreement a binding settlement under California Civil Procedure Code section 664.6. The Court denied the motion as moot, as the parties had already agreed to the settlement. The Court also denied the Defendants' request for sanctions in the amount of $7,980, as it did not appear that Plaintiff's actions were intended to cause delay, but rather attempted to comply with the agreement.
