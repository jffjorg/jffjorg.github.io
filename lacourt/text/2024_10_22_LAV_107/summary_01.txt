Significant Statements:

  - The complaint sufficiently alleges causes of action for premises liability and negligence.
  - The demurrer must be sustained if the defects are apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.
  - Negligence may be pleaded generally, and because premises liability is a form of negligence, defendant's demand for factual specificity within the complaint is not a basis for sustaining her demurrer.
  - To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff's proof need not be alleged.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has reviewed the case and has overruled the demurrer filed by the defendant. The plaintiff, Kamran Dehdashtinejad, was injured at a premises owned or controlled by the defendant, Lurie Physical Therapy, P.C. et al. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant breached its duty to maintain the premises in a safe condition, which caused the plaintiff's injuries. The defendant argued that the complaint fails to state a cause of action, but the judge found that the complaint sufficiently alleges causes of action for premises liability and negligence.

The judge noted that the complaint does not need to specify every fact to survive a demurrer, and that negligence may be pleaded generally. The judge also found that the complaint sufficiently identifies which allegations are alleged against which defendants.

The case will proceed as scheduled, and the parties will have an opportunity to present their evidence and arguments to the court.
