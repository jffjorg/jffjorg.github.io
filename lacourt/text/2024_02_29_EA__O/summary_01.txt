And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The reasons for denial are: (1) the Doe defendants have not been dismissed, and (2) the evidence presented by the plaintiff regarding the loans and rental agreement is insufficient and inadequate. The plaintiff claims that the defendants owe him $56,710 in loans and $90,400.00 in rental agreement, but the evidence submitted by the plaintiff does not match the claimed amounts. The court requires the plaintiff to reorganize the evidence and provide more detailed documentation to support his claims.
