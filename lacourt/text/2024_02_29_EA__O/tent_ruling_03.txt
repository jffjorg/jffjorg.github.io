non-opposition to the instant motions.

Counsels Ian King, Nicole Stewart, and William Thorpe seek
to appear as counsel pro hac vice in this action on behalf of Defendants. If
admitted Pro Hac Vice, the attorneys would associate with Murchison &
Cumming, LLP, counsel of record for Defendants herein.

applications.

Based on the foregoing, the applications are granted.[1]
