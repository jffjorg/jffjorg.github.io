  Case Number:  23PSCV00064    Hearing Date:   February 29, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
Plaintiff ROBERT
LOZA’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice
because (1) Doe Defendants haven’t been dismissed and (2)
Insufficient/Conflicting Evidence Regarding the Loan(s) and Rental Agreement.   
 
Background
 
This case pertains to unpaid loan(s) and breach of a rental
agreement. Plaintiff ROBERT LOZA alleges the following against Defendants
ANDREA COLORADO, aka ANDREA LOZA and DANIEL LOZA[1]:As
for the loans, Defendants owe Plaintiff $56,710. As for the rental agreement,
that was entered into in July 2015 and in 2019, Defendants stopped paying rent;
the sum now due to Plaintiff from the Defendants is $90,400.00. 
 
On January 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed suit against Defendants
alleging the following three (3) causes of action (COAs): 1.    
Breach of Contract 2.    
Money Had and Received 3.    
Intentional Misrepresentation
 
On January 15, 2023, Defendants were served. (See January
17, 2023 Proofs of Service.)[2]
 
On May 25, 2023, default was entered as to both Defendants.
 
On February 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant application
for entry of default judgment. 
 
Discussion
Plaintiff seeks entry of default judgment in the total
amount of $149,499.00, which is comprised of $146,180.00 in damages, $2,680.00
in attorney fees, and $639.00 in costs. 
 
The
application is denied for the following defects. 
 
1.    
Dismissal of Doe Defendants
Pursuant to California Code
of Civil Procedure section 585, a plaintiff seek default judgment must dismiss
all parties against whom judgment is not sought. 
Here, Doe Defendants have not
been dismissed. 
Therefore, that is one defect
warranting denial.[3]
2.    
Evidence Re: Loans
 
According to Plaintiff’s declaration, he has made “numerous
loans” to Defendants. (Loza Decl., ¶3.) “While the
loans are not specifically detailed in any writing, they are on a loan by loan
basis. The Defendants and I have written ledgers that are evidence of the debts
owed, with sufficient detail that describes the amount of the loans, the
reason, the approximate dates, and includes the accruing debt owed.” (¶3.)
 
Here,
however, the submitted evidence (Exhibits 2 and 3) do not match the $56,710 sum.[4] For
one, the filings are duplicates. For example, p. 11 of 25 of the PDF,
loan dated to 6/24/2013, is identical to p. 15 of 25 of PDF. If anything,
the loan appears to be for a grand total of $17,500.00. (See e.g., p. 15 of
25 [“Grand Total $17,500.00.”].) Additionally, the loan amount appears to
include interest, but it is unclear whether the parties agreed to the interest
as Plaintiff’s declaration doesn’t speak to it. (See e.g., p. 15 of 25 of PDF
[“Total $15,000.00 Plus Interest $2,500.00.”].) 
 
Additionally, there is inadequate evidence. While some
of the loan payments were in cash (e.g., p. 16 of 25 of PDF [“Cash 3/16/20
$350.00; 3/15/20 $300”], other payments were transferred from a bank. (Ibid,
[e.g., “Transfer from Bank” dated 1/30/20 for $200 or 1/28/2020 for
$3,500.”].) Therefore, as
a default judgment requires evidence, then bank statements are to be
provided to corroborate said transfers. 
 
Therefore, due to the inconsistent and
insufficient/inadequate evidence, this is another reason the default judgment application
is denied.
 
 
 
3.    
Rental Agreement 
 
According to the complaint, the rent was $2,250.00 per month
for the relevant time period. (See Complaint ¶3.)
 
Here, however, the rental agreement states that the agreed upon
rent was $2,000 per month. (Loza Decl., Ex. A [Month-to-Month Rental
Agreement], p. 6 of 25 of PDF.) 
 
Therefore, absent clarification as to the arbitrary change in the
monthly rental amount, this is another defect that warrants denial of the
default judgment application. 
 
All in all, while Defendants
failure to answer constitutes as an admission of liability, there must still be evidence offered
to support the allegations, evidence of which this court finds insufficient and
inadequate for entry of default judgment. (See Kim v. Westmoore Partners,
Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 272-286.)  
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the application for default judgment is
denied. Should Plaintiff seek to refile its application, the court requests all
material be submitted within 16 court days of the hearing date. Additionally,
if possible, the court requests a reorganization of the evidence such that one
exhibit addresses only the loans and another exhibit only addresses
the rental agreement.
