MOTION
 
On May 7, 2021, Plaintiff Maria Tabarez (“Plaintiff”) served Defendant
Alta Hospitals System, LLC (“Defendant”) and the Labor & Workforce
Development Agency (“LWDA”) with a Notice of Violations and draft complaint.  (Lapuyade Decl. ¶ 11.)  The 65-day “waiting period” pursuant to Labor
Code section 2699.3, subdivision (a)(2)(A) lapsed without the LWDA notifying
Plaintiff it intended to investigate or otherwise take action with respect to
Plaintiff’s claims.  (Lapuyade Decl.
¶13.)  Thus, on August 16, 2021, Plaintiff
filed the instant Private Attorney General’s Act (“PAGA”) action against
Defendant.  
 
On July 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed an amended PAGA notice with the LWDA,
pursuant to the terms of the settlement, including facts and allegations for
violations of various sections of the Labor Code and California Code of
Regulations.  (Lapuyade Decl. ¶ 19.)  On October 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”).
 
Plaintiff now moves for approval of the PAGA settlement.  Plaintiff’s motion is unopposed.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
“Under
PAGA, an aggrieved employee may bring a civil action personally and on behalf
of other current or former employees to recover civil penalties for Labor Code
violations. Of the civil penalties recovered, 75 percent goes to the Labor and
Workforce Development Agency, leaving the remaining 25 percent for the
‘aggrieved employees.”  (Townley v.
BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 179, 181 [cleaned up].)  An individual employee is not entitled to
recover the entire 25 percent amount of civil penalties allocated to aggrieved
employees.  (Moorer v. Noble L.A.
Events, Inc. (2019) 32 Cal.App.5th 736, 742.)
 
            “The superior court shall review and
approve any settlement of any civil action filed pursuant to this part.”  (Labor Code, § 2699, subd. (l)(2).)  “[A] trial court should evaluate a
PAGA settlement to determine whether it is fair, reasonable, and adequate in
view of PAGA's purposes to remediate present labor law violations, deter future
ones, and to maximize enforcement of state labor laws.”  (Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc. (2021) 72
Cal.App.5th 56, 77.) 
 
            The parties seek to settle the
matter for $355,000.00.  From the
settlement proceeds,  $140,808.85 will be
distributed to counsel for attorneys’ fees ($118,333.33) and reimbursement for
litigation costs ($22,475.52).  Further,
of the settlement proceeds, $3,965.00 will be allocated toward administration
expenses; and $10,000 will be distributed to Plaintiff, as the PAGA
representative plaintiff.  
 
            The remaining $200,226.15 will be
allocated as follows:  (i) 75% distributed
to the LWDA and (ii) 25% distributed among the 176 aggrieved employees, as
required under Labor Code section 2699 and ZB, N.A. v. Superior Court (2019)
8 Cal.5th 175.  (Lapuyade Decl. ¶ 22 and
Ex. 1.)
 
            In coming up with the $355,000 figure, Plaintiff’s
consultant performed an in-depth analysis of the potential maximum recovery for
each claim as follows:
 
Claim                         Penalty           # Violations   Violation Rate                       Total 
Unpaid Wages            $50                  10,163             100% of Pay Periods              $508,150
Unpaid Overtime        $100                516                  5.1% of Pay Periods               $51,600
Meal Periods               $50                  6,105               60.1% of Pay Periods             $305,250
Rest Periods                $50                  10,103             99.4% of Pay Periods             $505,150
Wage Statements        $100                10,163             100% of Pay Periods              $1,016,300
Waiting Time             $100                68                    100%
of Pay Periods              $6,800
Reimbursement          $100                10,163             100% of Pay Periods              $1,016,300
 
(Lapuyade Decl. at
¶ 24.)
 
            Thus, the maximum total exposure is
$3,409,550.  (Lapuyade Decl. at ¶
23.)  Thus, the requested $355k figure
represents approximately 10.4% of the maximum potential exposure.  With respect to the risk of litigation, in
order to prevail in obtaining civil penalties, Plaintiff would need to prove
each Labor Code violation for each Aggrieved Employee.  The settlement was negotiated by counsel at
arm’s length, through the assistance of a mediator.  (Lapuyade Decl. at ¶¶ 17, 36.)
 
            Counsel also provides billing
records for attorneys’ fees and costs incurred to date, totaling the requested
$153,535.75.  (Lapuyade Decl. ¶¶ 42, 58; see
also Zakay Decl. and Blouw Decl.) 
Further, Counsel provides an itemization for the requested $3,965.00 in
administration costs.  (Ex. B to
Hartranft Decl.)
 
            Therefore, the Court finds that the proposed
settlement amount is fair, reasonable and adequate in all respects.  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
For the reasons stated, the Court grants Plaintiff’s Motion for
Approval of PAGA Settlement in its entirety and the Court will enter the
proposed Order.
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file the
notice with a proof of service forthwith.
