And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to serve the defendant, Silverston & Associates, Inc., via the California Secretary of State. The plaintiff brought suit against the defendant alleging four causes of action, including breach of contract, foreclosure of mechanic's lien, recovery on mechanic's lien release bond, and quantum meruit. The plaintiff attempted to serve the defendant's registered agent, Sunshine Armstrong, but was unable to do so. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not demonstrated diligent efforts to serve the defendant and therefore denies the motion. The judge also continues the case management conference and order to show cause regarding monetary sanctions for failure to file proof of service of the summons and complaint on the defendant.
