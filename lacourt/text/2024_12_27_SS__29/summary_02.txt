And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Hitabarada v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Case Number: 23STCV20355). The case involves two consolidated actions arising from an accident on May 26, 2023, near the intersection of Broadway and Washington Boulevard in Los Angeles.

The defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, filed a motion for terminating sanctions against the plaintiff, Noah Williams, on November 25, 2024. The motion was unopposed. Williams failed to appear for his deposition on November 7, 2024, and also failed to pay the sanctions ordered by the court.

The judge found that Williams's failure to comply with discovery orders was a serious misuse of the discovery process. However, the judge denied the request for terminating sanctions, finding that there was no evidence of repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process, and that a terminating sanction would create a windfall for Metro.

The judge granted in part the request for monetary sanctions, ordering Williams to pay $750 to Metro within 30 days of notice. The judge also found that monetary sanctions were appropriate as Metro had incurred expenses as a result of Williams's misuse of the discovery process.
