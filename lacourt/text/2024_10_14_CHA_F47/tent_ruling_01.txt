Case #21CHCV00940
 
MOTION TO BE
RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Motion filed on 9/24/24.
 
MOVING ATTORNEY: David K.
Dorenfeld, DorenfeldLaw, Inc.
CLIENT: Plaintiff Lawrence A. Garoutte
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order relieving attorney David K. Dorenfeld of DorenfeldLaw, Inc. as counsel for
Plaintiff Lawrence A. Garoutte in this action.

 
RULING: The motion is placed off calendar.
 
On 9/24/24, attorney David K. Dorenfeld of DorenfeldLaw,
Inc. (Counsel) filed and served the instant motion to be relieved as counsel
for Plaintiff Lawrence A. Garoutte in this action.  The original hearing date listed on the
papers is 3/11/25.  
 
On 10/4/24, Counsel filed a Notice of Advanced Hearing
Date indicating that the 3/11/25 hearing date was “advanced by the Court to the
date of October 14, 2024.”  However,
there is no court order indicating that the Court advanced the hearing date or
shortened time for the hearing on the motion to be relieved as counsel.  Rather, eCourt indicates that on 9/24/24, the
party, not the Court, rescheduled the hearing date to 10/14/24.  The proof of service attached to the Notice
of Advanced Hearing Date indicates that it was served on 9/24/24 by mail and
electronic service.
 
Service by either method on 9/24/24 does not provide the
16 court days plus 5 court days notice required for service by mail and 16
court days plus 2 court days notice required for service by email for the
10/14/24 hearing date.  See CCP
1005(b); CCP 1010.6(a)(3)(B).
 
Since there is no response to the motion to cure the
defect in notice, the matter is placed off calendar.
