And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion filed by the defendant, Gustavo Medina, to deem admitted the truth of all matters specified in his Requests for Admissions, served on the plaintiff, Zulma Suraya Ovando Ramos. The requests were served on Ramos on January 22, 2024, and no responses were received by the deadline. The defendant has not received any opposition to the motion. The judge notes that there is an issue with the service of the motion on the counsel for the other plaintiff, Olivia Capristo Palacios, but if Palacios' counsel appears at the hearing and waives the defect in notice, the motion will be granted. If not, the hearing will be continued to allow the defendant to properly serve the motion on Palacios' counsel.
