And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The ruling states that the demurrer is overruled and the motion to strike is denied. The defendants had filed the demurrer and motion to strike against the plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint, which alleged claims of elder abuse, willful misconduct, unfair business practices, battery, and negligence.

The judge found that the plaintiff's allegations of neglect and abuse were sufficient to support the claims of elder abuse and willful misconduct. The judge also found that the plaintiff's claims for punitive/exemplary damages, attorneys' fees and costs, and restitutionary disgorgement were properly pled.

The judge also denied the defendants' argument that the plaintiff could not recover treble damages under Civil Code 3345. The judge found that the enhanced remedies available to a plaintiff under an elder abuse claim could qualify as a penalty for which treble damages may be awarded.

Finally, the judge ordered that the answer to the Second Amended Complaint is due within 30 days.
