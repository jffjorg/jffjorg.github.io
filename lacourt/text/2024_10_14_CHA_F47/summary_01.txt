And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has placed the motion to be relieved as counsel off calendar due to a defect in notice. The original hearing date was set for March 11, 2025, but was advanced to October 14, 2024, without a court order. The service of the motion was attempted on September 24, 2024, by mail and electronic service, but this does not provide the required notice for the new hearing date. As a result, the matter is being placed off calendar and will not proceed.
