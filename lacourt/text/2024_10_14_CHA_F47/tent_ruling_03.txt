SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises from the care and services provided to
Plaintiff Rose Adele Cavanagh (Plaintiff) beginning on 7/24/20 while she was a
resident at Defendant Pacifica Senior Living Santa Clarita (the Facility), a
residential care facility for the elderly. 
Plaintiff alleges that all defendants owned, operated, managed and/or
controlled the Facility and were Plaintiff’s “care custodians.”  (SAC ¶¶11, 14-15).  
 
Plaintiff alleges Defendants were to provide elderly care
services to Plaintiff including care and supervision to prevent pressure
injuries and ulcers, and safe transportation from her bed to her power
wheelchair, among other requirements mandated by law.  (SAC ¶18). 
Plaintiff alleges that at all relevant times, she was unable to move her
left lower leg due to multiple sclerosis, which required turning her every 2 hours
to avoid pressure ulcers and special care and attention during her transfers.  (SAC ¶¶16, 18-19, 25).
 
Plaintiff alleges that between 9/13/20 and 12/10/20, while
under the care and custody of Defendants, Plaintiff developed a Stage 2 wound
on her coccyx due to being neglected and not properly turned because Defendants
were not following their own Plan of Care which required turning Plaintiff every
2 hours.  (SAC ¶20).  Plaintiff alleges that her wounds continued
to get worse due to Defendants completely failing to care for her wound until
she was transferred out of Defendants’ care on 5/21/21.  (SAC ¶21). 
Plaintiff alleges that upon her return to the Facility on 6/4/21,
Defendants continued to fail to turn Plaintiff every 2 hours as required by her
Plan of Care resulting in Plaintiff developing a Stage 1-2 wound on her
buttocks.  (SAC ¶¶22-23).
 
Plaintiff alleges that prior to 4/14/22, Defendants’
employees were improperly transferring Plaintiff by allowing her immobile left
leg to hit hard objects and get caught in her bedding, causing pain to
Plaintiff’s leg and the need for an X-Ray.  (SAC ¶24). 
Plaintiff alleges that on 5/5/22, Defendants’ employee and caregiver of
Plaintiff, without Plaintiff’s consent, forcefully transferred Plaintiff from
her bed to her wheelchair when her left leg was stuck in the bed—snapping
Plaintiff’s left tibia and fibula requiring surgery.  (SAC ¶25). 
Plaintiff alleges that, based on the circumstances known to the
caregiver, the foregoing conduct was done with the intent to harm her.  (SAC ¶79; See also SAC ¶¶25).   
 
Plaintiff also alleges that Melanie Rivera, Defendants’
Executive Director, had the duty to investigate the 5/5/22 incident and prior
events leading up to Plaintiff’s 4/14/22 X-Ray, and had the duty to reprimand,
retrain, and/or discipline employees for their conduct.  (SAC ¶26). 
Plaintiff alleges that Rivera was aware of the improper transfer by the
caregiver, the repeated failure of caregivers to follow Plaintiff’s Plan of
Care as developed by Defendants, and violations of State and Federal laws.  (SAC ¶26). 
Plaintiff alleges that Rivera approved of and  ratified the conduct complained of in the
Second Amended Complaint by not taking any action to ensure that Defendants’ employees
followed Plaintiff’s Plan of Care or would follow her Plan of Care in the
future.  (SAC ¶26).  Additionally, Plaintiff alleges that
Plaintiff’s pressure sores and leg fracture were caused by Defendants’ failure
to provide their employees with the training mandated by law for elderly care
services, and the failure to properly supervise their employees.  (SAC ¶35). 

 
Plaintiff further alleges that after Defendants were
aware of Plaintiff’s bedsores and fractured leg, Defendants failed to report
the true extent and nature of Plaintiff’s condition as mandated by federal and
state care service laws.  (SAC ¶28).  Plaintiff contends that Defendants’ conduct
violated several Federal and State laws, including but not limited to Welfare
& Institutions Code 15610.57, Health & Safety Code 1569.312, and 22
C.C.R. 87466, 87468.1, 87468.2, 87631. (SAC ¶29).  
 
On 8/2/23, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendants
Pacifica SL Santa Clarita LLC dba Pacifica Senior Living Santa Clarita
erroneously sued as Pacifica Senior Living aka Pacifica Senior Living Newhall
aka Pacifica Senior Living Santa Clarita; Pacifica Living Management LLC; W
Lyons LLC; Pacifica Companies LLC dba Pacifica Senior Living Santa Clarita
(collectively, Defendants) for: (1) Negligence and (2) Elder Abuse.  In response to Defendants’ demurrer and
motion to strike addressing the original complaint, on 3/20/24, Plaintiff filed
a First Amended Complaint against Defendants for: (1) Dependent and Elder
Abuse/Neglect, (2) Willful Misconduct, (3) Negligence, (4) Unfair Business
Practices (Business & Professions Code 17200, et seq.) and (5) Battery.  On 7/18/24, this Court sustained Defendants’
demurrer to the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th
causes of action in the First Amended Complaint and granted Defendants’ motion
to strike portions of the First Amended Complaint regarding
punitive/exemplary damages, attorneys’ fees and costs under Welfare &
Institutions Code 15657, restitutionary disgorgement pursuant to Business and
Professions Code 15657 and treble damages pursuant to Civil Code 3345.  Plaintiff was given 30 days leave to
amend her pleading.  (See 7/18/24
Minute Order).
 
On 8/12/24, Plaintiff filed the subject Second Amended
Complaint alleging the same 5 causes of action asserted in the First Amended
Complaint.  After meet and confer efforts
failed to resolve the issues Defendants had with the Second Amended Complaint,
Defendants filed and served the instant demurrer to the 1st, 2nd,
4th and 5th causes of action in the Second Amended
Complaint and the instant motion to strike which seeks to strike portions of
the Second Amended Complaint regarding punitive/exemplary damages, attorneys’
fees and costs under Welfare & Institutions Code 15657, restitutionary
disgorgement pursuant to Business and Professions Code 15657 and treble damages
pursuant to Civil Code 3345.  Plaintiff
has filed a combined opposition to the 
demurrer and motion to strike and Defendants have filed replies to the
opposition.    
 
ANALYSIS
 
1st cause of action – Dependent and Elder
Abuse/Neglect
 
The elements an elder neglect cause of action are: (1) defendants
had care or custody of Plaintiff; (2) Plaintiff was 65 years of age or older;
(3) Defendants failed to use the degree of care that a reasonable person in the
same situation would have used in protecting Plaintiff from health and safety
hazards; (4) Plaintiff was harmed; and (5) Defendants’ conduct was a
substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s harm.  CACI 3103 Neglect—Essential Factual Elements;
Welfare & Institutions Code 15610.57; Winn (2016) 63 C4th 148, 156. 
 
Such a claim must be pleaded with particularity.  Covenant Care, Inc. (2004) 32 C4th
771, 790; Carter (2011) 198 CA4th 396, 410.  To recover for dependent adult/elder abuse/neglect,
a plaintiff must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant is
liable for physical abuse as defined by Welfare & Institutions Code
15610.63 or neglect as defined by Welfare & Institutions Code 15610.57, and
that the defendant is guilty of recklessness, oppression, fraud, or malice in
the commission of the abuse/neglect.  See
Welfare & Institutions Code 15657; Delaney (1999) 20 C4th 23, 31-32;
Covenant Care, supra at 785. 
Recklessness is defined as the deliberate disregard of the high degree
of probability that an injury will occur, or a “conscious choice of a course of
action with knowledge of the serious dangers to others involved in it.”  Delaney, supra at 31-32.
 
It has been held that “if a care facility knows it must
provide a certain type of care on a daily basis but provides that care
sporadically or is supposed to provide multiple types of care but only provides
some of those types of care, withholding of care has occurred” and “[i]n those
cases, the trier of fact must determine whether there is a significant pattern
of withholding portions or types of care.” 
See Sababin (2006) 144 CA4th 81, 90.  The fact that some care was provided to
Plaintiff by Defendants does not absolve them from liability for elder
abuse/neglect.  Id.
 
Plaintiff’s allegations that: (1) Defendants failed to
turn her every 2 hours as required by their Plan of Care causing Plaintiff’s
transfer to a skilled nursing facility to care for her resulting pressure
wounds; (2) Defendants’ employees’ failed to take precautions for Plaintiff’s
immobile leg when transferring her to her wheelchair resulting in pain, X-Rays
and ultimately a fracture; and (3) ratification of such conduct by Defendants’
Executive Director are sufficient to support Plaintiff’s claim for neglect.  (See SAC ¶¶19-28, 38).
 
2nd cause of action – Willful Misconduct
 
For the same reasons Plaintiff’s 1st cause of
action is sufficiently pled, Plaintiff’s claim for willful misconduct is
adequately pled.  Defendants provide no
authority to support their argument that the demurrer to this cause of action
should be sustained because the claim is duplicative of the elder abuse/neglect
cause of action.  And, such is not a
ground on which a demurrer may be sustained. 
See CCP 430.10.  
 
4th cause of action – Unfair Business
Practices (Business & Professions Code 17200, et seq.)
 
A claim for unfair business practices may be based on unlawful,
unfair or fraudulent business practices. 
See Business & Professions Code 17200; Daugherty
(2006) 144 CA4th 824, 837.  In order for
a private plaintiff to recover on such a claim, there must be a causal
connection between the harm suffered and the unlawful business activity.  Daro (2007) 151 CA4th 1079, 1099.  
 
The same conduct which supports Plaintiff’s claim for
elder abuse/neglect also provides a sufficient basis for Plaintiff’s cause of
action under Business and Professions Code 17200.  See Mahan (2017) 14 CA5th 841,
868; Black (2001) 92 CA4th 917.  
 
5th cause of action – Battery
 
The elements of a battery cause of action are: (1) defendant
touched plaintiff, or caused plaintiff to be touched, with the intent to harm
or offend plaintiff; (2) plaintiff did not consent to the touching; (3)
plaintiff was harmed or offended by defendant’s conduct; and (4) a reasonable
person in plaintiff’s position would have been offended by the touching.  So (2013) 212 CA4th 652, 669.        
 
On demurrer, the Court must accept Plaintiff’s
allegations as true.  Construction
Protective Services, Inc. (2002) 29 C4th 189, 193.  Based on the allegations that: Defendants’
employee intentionally touched Plaintiff on 5/5/22, with intent to harm her;
Plaintiff did not consent to the touching; plaintiff was harmed as a result and
a reasonable person would have been offended by such conduct, Plaintiff has
sufficiently pled a claim for battery. 
(SAC ¶¶25, 78, 79, 80, 82).
 
Motion to Strike
 
The facts which are sufficient to support Plaintiff’s
claims for elder abuse/neglect and willful misconduct are also sufficient to
support Plaintiff’s claim for punitive/exemplary damages.  Similarly, because the 1st and 3rd
causes action are sufficiently pled, Plaintiff’s claims for attorneys’ fees and
costs under Welfare & Institutions Code 15657 and restitutionary
disgorgement pursuant to Business and Professions Code 15657 are properly
pled.  
 
Defendants have also failed to establish, as a matter of
law, that Plaintiff cannot recover treble damages under Civil Code 3345.  Clark (2010) 50 C4th 605, 614, relied
on by Defendants, did not include a claim for elder abuse/neglect.  Rather, the underlying claim was for unfair
competition.  Id.  Here, Defendants merely conclude that there
are no penalty damages under Plaintiff’s elder abuse/neglect cause of
action.  However, Defendant has not
established that the enhanced remedies available to a plaintiff under an elder
abuse/neglect cause of action cannot qualify as a penalty for which treble
damages may be awarded under Civil Code 3345, especially when the conduct which
forms the basis for the elder abuse/neglect claim also forms the basis for an
unfair business practices claim. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer is overruled and the motion to strike is
denied.  Answer is due within 30
days.
