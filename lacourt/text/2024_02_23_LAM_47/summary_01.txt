This is a tentative ruling by Judge Theresa M. Traber in the case of Myung Hye Kim v. David Okju An et al., case number 22STCP03518. The case involves a dispute over alleged fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and elder abuse related to construction work. The Plaintiff, Myung Hye Kim, moves to compel further responses to requests for production and special interrogatories, and seeks sanctions against the Defendant, David Okju An, for failing to provide code-compliant responses. The Judge grants the motion to compel further responses to requests for production in part, ordering the Defendant to provide further verified, code-compliant responses without objections within 20 days. The Judge denies the request for sanctions, finding that the fee request is unreasonably inflated. The case is set for trial on April 16, 2024.
