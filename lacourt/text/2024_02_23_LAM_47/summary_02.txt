And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Theresa M. Traber, is considering a motion to quash a deposition subpoena for business records propounded to Los Angeles Conservation Corps, Inc. by Defendant CS Hotel LLC and Percy Cifuentes. The subpoena seeks various documents related to Plaintiff Stewart Marroquin's employment history, including applications, employee handbooks, termination records, and performance reviews.

The Judge grants the motion to quash as to certain document categories, including disciplinary records and complaints of discrimination. The Judge also limits the production of certain documents, including payroll records and tax forms, to only those that are relevant to the case.

The Judge denies the motion to quash as to other document categories, including employment applications, job descriptions, and termination records, but limits the production of these documents to only those that are relevant to the case.

The Judge's ruling is based on the parties' arguments regarding the relevance and overbreadth of the deposition subpoena, as well as Plaintiff's privacy objections to producing certain documents. The Judge finds that some of the documents sought are reasonably calculated to lead to the disclosure of admissible evidence, while others are not.
