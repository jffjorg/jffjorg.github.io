And here is a brief English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants Herbalcure Corporation's motion to intervene in the lawsuit, allowing them to assert claims against both the plaintiff and defendants. The judge also continues the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction to March 21, 2023, and orders the plaintiff to re-file its moving papers and serve them on Herbalcure Corporation by February 27, 2024. The judge finds that Herbalcure Corporation has demonstrated an interest in the property that is the subject of the action and must be permitted to assert its claims in intervention to protect that interest.
