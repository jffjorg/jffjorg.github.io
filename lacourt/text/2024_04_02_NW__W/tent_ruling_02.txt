BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff John Thomas Skidmore alleges he was a customer of
Verizon Wireless Services. Defendant Luis Angel Cortez, an employee of Verizon,
allegedly offered to reduce Plaintiff’s monthly charges on five of his phone
lines; however, Defendant Cortez made unauthorized changes to Plaintiff’s
account with Verizon which caused him to be overcharged $15,436.30 by opening
over 60 ‘ghost lines’ in Plaintiff’s name.  
 
On March 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants
for breach of contract, money had and received, and fraud.

DISCUSSION
 
I.                   
MOTION TO
COMPEL DEFENDANT'S LUIS ANGEL CORTEZ, FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUESTS FOR
PRODUCTION - SET ONE
 
Plaintiff
moves this court for an order compelling Defendant Luis Angel Cortez to provide
further responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production, Set One. Plaintiff
also requests an order requiring Defendant to pay monetary sanctions to
reimburse Plaintiff for its reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred in
bringing this motion. 
 
A motion to compel further responses to
a demand for inspection or production of documents (“RFP”) may be brought based
on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive or
incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly
generalized objections.  (CCP § 2031.310(c).) A motion to compel
further production must set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying
the discovery sought by the inspection demand. (See CCP § 2031.310(b)(1).) It
is not necessary for the motion to show that the material sought will be
admissible in evidence. “Good cause” may be found to justify discovery where
specific facts show that the discovery is necessary for effective trial
preparation or to prevent surprise at trial. (See Associated Brewers Dist.
Co. v. Superior Court (1967) 65 Cal.2d 583, 586-588; see also CCP §§
2017.010, 2019.030(a)(1)
 
Plaintiff argues to date, the Defendant
has failed to serve any documents with respect to his promise that “Defendant
will produce responsive nonprivileged documents in his possession, custody and
control.” 
 
In opposition, Defendant argues Plaintiff’s
characterization of Defendant’s response is inaccurate. Specifically, Defendant
conditioned production of documents upon the entry of an appropriate protective
order, and subject to objections. Defendant further argues Plaintiff also fails
to comply with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345 requiring that a Separate
Statement set forth the “full response” to each discovery demand. Because
Plaintiff omitted the phrase “after entry of an appropriate protective order”,
Defendant argues the motion should be denied. 
 
The court agrees the Separate Statement
is not the full response as Defendant states “after entry of an appropriate
protective order, Defendant will produce responsive nonprivileged documents in
his possession, custody and control.” The court orders the parties to meet and
confer to enter a protective order agreement. Once executed, Defendant is to
produce the documents as they are relevant. 

 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to
Compel Defendant's Luis Angel Cortez Further Responses to Requests for
Production - Set One is DENIED. 
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff requests $940.00 in sanctions
against Defendant. Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is denied. The court finds
substantial justification in opposing the motion. 
 
II.                 
MOTION TO COMPEL DEFENDANT’S VERIZON WIRELESS
SERVICES LLC, RESPONSES TO REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION - SET ONE
 
Plaintiff moves this court for an order
compelling Defendant Verizon Wireless Services LLC to provide responses
Plaintiff’s Request for Production – Set One and an order requiring Defendant
to pay monetary sanctions. 
 
Where a party fails to serve timely
responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling
responses. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300, 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 403.) A party that fails to serve a timely response to the discovery
request waives any objection to the request, including one based on privilege
or the protection of attorney work product. (CCP §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a);
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at
404.)
 
According to Plaintiff, they served
Plaintiff’s discovery demands on July 11, 2023. (Landsman Decl. ¶5.) Defendant
responded; however, in essence, Defendant refused to respond and contended that
the case would be ordered to arbitration. (Landsman Decl. ¶6.) When Defendant’s
motion for arbitration was denied, Defendant did not meet and confer regarding
their overdue discovery responses and instead, unilaterally asserted it would
respond to Plaintiff’s discovery demand at their convenience. (Landsman Decl.
¶¶9, 10.) Defendant eventually served its responses December 11, 2023.
(Landsman Decl. ¶11.) However, Defendant’s response included no documents.
(Landsman Decl. ¶12.) Plaintiff reached out and Defendant informed Plaintiff “We
will produce documents soon, along with Verizon's verification.” (Landsman
Decl. ¶14.) No further responses have been given. (Landsman Decl. ¶16.) 
 
First, it is true unverified discovery
responses are tantamount to no response at all and are subject to a motion to
compel responses (rather than a motion to compel further responses).  (Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206
Cal. App. 3d 632, 635-36.) However, objections do not need to be
verified.  (See Blue Ridge Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1988) 202
Cal.App.3d 339, 345; Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 651, 657.)  Regardless, Defendant has now provided
verified answers. (Ekmekchyan Decl. ¶6, Exh. D.) As for the responses that
asserted a need for a protective order prior to the production of certain
documents, as noted above, the parties are to work together to enter a
protective order. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to
Compel Defendant’s Verizon Wireless Services LLC, Responses to Requests for
Production - Set One is DENIED. 
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff requests $940.00 in sanctions
against Defendant. Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is denied. The court finds
substantial justification in opposing the motion.
