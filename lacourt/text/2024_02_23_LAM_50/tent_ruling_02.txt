[1]On February 8,
2024, the Opposing Parties filed a Notice of Errata regarding their opposition
to Mr. Little’s supplemental declaration. The instant order concerns the
opposition attached to the Opposing Parties’ February 8, 2024 notice of errata.

 


[2]As discussed, no
opposition was filed to Plaintiff’s November 13, 2023 motion for appellate
attorney’s fees. 


[3]In the January 24, 2024 Order, the Court noted that
“it is unclear what the requested hourly rate is for attorney Robert
Little. Plaintiff’s counsel states that ‘Mr. Little has an hourly rate of $845,
which has been discounted in this matter to $590-$625.’ (Kennedy Decl., ¶ 12.)
However, Plaintiff’s counsel then states that ‘Mr. Little’s current discounted
rate is $680.’ (Kennedy Decl., ¶ 18.).” (January 24, 2024 Order at p. 7:7-10.) The
Court finds that in his January 31, 2024 declaration, Mr. Little has clarified
what is requested hourly rates are.
