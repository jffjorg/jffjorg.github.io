The judge found that the plaintiff, Victoria Trevisan, did not adequately allege that the Merck defendants' conduct was ratified by their officers, directors, or managing agents, as required by Civil Code section 3294, subdivision (b). The judge also noted that the plaintiff did not oppose the motion and did not provide any basis for amending the FAC to cure the deficiencies. The judge granted the motion without leave to amend, citing the previous ruling on the original Complaint. The Merck defendants are ordered to file and serve an answer to the FAC within 10 days of the date of the order.
