[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:
PLAINTIFF’S
  MOTION FOR STATUTORY APPELLATE ATTORNEY’S FEES UNDER C.C.P. § 425.16, SUBD. (c)(1)




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 



 
Background
Plaintiff Curtis R. Olson (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on December
23, 2019 against a number of defendants, including Vidala Aaronoff, Gloria P.
Martinez-Senftner, and the Martinez Law Group, P.C. 
Plaintiff filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) on
November 17, 2020, alleging ten causes of action.
On August 29, 2023, Jane Doe filed a Cross-Complaint in this action
against, inter alia, Plaintiff. The Cross-Complaint alleges nine causes
of action. 
On July 23, 2021, the Court issued an Order concerning Defendants
Vidala Aaronoff, Gloria Martinez-Senftner, and Martinez Law Group, P.C.’s
(collectively “Defendants”) special motion to strike Plaintiff’s SAC. The
Court’s July 23, 2021 minute order provides, inter alia, that “the
anti-SLAPP motions to the initial Complaint and the FAC are denied as moot.
Accordingly, the Court only considers the anti-SLAPP motion to the SAC.” (July
23, 2021 minute order at p. 4.) The July 23, 2021
minute order further provides that “Defendants’ special motion to strike is
denied. Defendants have 30 days from the date of this Order to answer the SAC.”
(Id. at p. 8.) 
Plaintiff indicates that “Defendants appealed the denial of their
anti-SLAPP motions to the Second District Court of Appeal…in appellate case no.
B315237.” (Kennedy Decl., ¶ 8.) On February 24, 2023, the Court of Appeal,
Second Appellate District, Division Two issued an opinion in Case No. B315237.
(Kennedy Decl., ¶ 8, Ex. C.) The Court of Appeal’s February 24, 2023 opinion provides,
inter alia, that “Aaronoff, Martinez-Senftner, and MLG filed a special
motion to strike Olson’s suit under the anti-SLAPP…statute…which the trial
court denied. In challenging that order, they point to two constitutionally
protected activities they contend are endangered by Olson’s suit: (1)
litigation funding and (2) religious expression. Because Aaronoff,
Martinez-Senftner, and MLG have not made the requisite showing for striking a
suit under the anti-SLAPP statute, we affirm the order.” (Kennedy Decl., ¶ 8,
Ex. C, pp. 2-3.) On June 1, 2023, a Remittitur was filed in this action
providing, inter alia, that “the attached is a true and correct copy of
the original order, opinion or decision entered in the above-entitled cause on
February 24, 2023 and that this order, opinion or decision has now become
final.” 
Plaintiff indicates that Defendants sought review by the California
Supreme Court. (Kennedy Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. D.) On May 31, 2023, the California
Supreme Court denied the petition for review. (Ibid.)

Plaintiff moved “for
a statutory award of attorneys’ fees as the prevailing plaintiff who
successfully prevailed against the appeals by Defendants Vidala Aaronoff,
Gloria Martinez-Senftner, and the Martinez Law Group, P.C…” The motion was
unopposed.   
On January 24, 2024, the Court issued an Order on the motion. The
Court’s January 24, 2024 Order provides, inter alia, that “the Court will
require a supplemental declaration from Plaintiff’s counsel more clearly
setting forth the fees incurred by Plaintiff in responding to Defendant’s
appeal. In addition, the Court will require additional information concerning
Mr. Little’s requested hourly rate.” (January 24, 2024 Order at p. 7:23-26.) 
            The January 24, 2024 Order further
provides that “[b]ased on the foregoing, the
Court continues the hearing on the instant motion to 2/23/24…The Court sets the
following briefing schedule: Plaintiff’s supplemental declaration to be
filed and served by 1/31/24, with a courtesy copy delivered to Dept.
50. Defendants’ response, if any, to be filed and served by 2/7/24, with a
courtesy copy delivered to Dept. 50. The argument and evidence in the
supplemental papers are limited to the requested additional information, as
discussed above, and the response thereto. The parties may not include any
argument or evidence on any other issue.” (January
24, 2024 Order at p. 8:12-21.) 
On January 31, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a Declaration of Robert C. Little in Supplemental Support of
Plaintiff’s Motion for Statutory Appellate Attorney’s Fees Under C.C.P. § 425.16, subd. (c)(1). On February 7, 2024, ATW
Trust, John Walkowiak, ATW Church, Martinez Law Group, PC, Gloria
Martinez-Senftner and Vidala Aaronoff (collectively, the “Opposing Parties”)
filed an opposition to Mr. Little’s Declaration in supplemental support of the motion.[1]
Discussion
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
425.16, subdivision (c)(1), “[i]f the
court finds that a special motion to strike is frivolous or is solely intended
to cause unnecessary delay, the court shall award costs and reasonable
attorney’s fees to a plaintiff prevailing on the motion, pursuant to Section 128.5.” (Emphasis added.) “The imposition of
sanctions for a frivolous anti-SLAPP motion is therefore mandatory.” ((Foundation
for Taxpayer & Consumer Rights v. Garamendi (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 1375, 1388.) 
Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5,
subdivision (a) provides, “[a] trial court may order a party,
the party’s attorney, or both, to pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by another party as a
result of actions or tactics, made in bad faith, that
are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.” Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5, subdivision (b)(2)
defines “frivolous”
as “totally and completely without merit or for the sole purpose of harassing
an opposing party.” In addition, “[a] motion is totally and completely without
merit for purposes of a finding of frivolousness under section 425.16, subdivision (c)(1) or section 128.5 only if any reasonable attorney would
agree that the motion is totally devoid of merit. This is an
objective standard. Whether the sole purpose of the motion is to harass an
opposing party or the motion is solely intended to cause unnecessary delay, in
contrast, concerns the subjective motivation of the moving defendant. The
moving defendant’s subjective motivation can be inferred from the absence of
any arguable merit.” ((Chitsazzadeh v. Kramer & Kaslow (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 676, 683–684 [internal
citations omitted].) 
As discussed in the
Court’s January 24, 2024 Order, Plaintiff cites to City of
Alhambra v. D'Ausilio (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1303-1304, where “Appellant Robert D’Ausilio sued respondent City of Alhambra (City) for civil rights violations and then settled
the case with the City. The City then sued appellant for breach of the
settlement agreement and declaratory relief. Appellant moved to strike the
declaratory relief claim under Code of Civil Procedure
section 425.16, the ‘anti-SLAPP’ statute…The trial court denied the motion
and awarded the City its
attorney fees.” The Court of Appeal “agree[d] that appellant failed to
demonstrate that the declaratory relief claim arose from activity protected
under the statute,” and therefore “affirm[ed] the order denying the motion.” (Id. at p. 1304.) the Court of Appeal also “grant[ed]
the City’s request for attorney fees
on appeal, the amount of which [was] to be determined by the trial court.” The City of Alhambra Court noted as follows: 
 
“The City requests
attorney fees on appeal. It argues that because appellant’s appeal ‘raises no
new permissible arguments that change the result, his appeal [like his motion]
is frivolous and was only intended to cause further delay of this litigation.’
We agree. ‘The right to attorney fees extends to attorney fees on appeal
as well.’ (Morrow v. Los Angeles Unified School
Dist. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 1424, 1446 [57 Cal. Rptr. 3d 885];…see
also Carpenter v. Jack in the Box Corp.
(2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 454, 461 [59 Cal. Rptr. 3d 839] [‘The trial
court’s authority to award fees and costs under section 425.16, subdivision
(c), includes authority to award fees incurred in responding to an appeal of an
order granting or denying a special motion to strike, or of an order awarding
attorney fees in connection with such motion.’].) The City is
awarded its attorney fees on appeal.” (City of Alhambra v. D'Ausilio, supra, at pages
1309-1310,
emphasis added.) 
The Court’s January 24, 2024 Order on the instant motion contains a
discussion and then 
provides,
inter alia, that “[b]ased on the foregoing, and in light of the
lack of any opposition by Defendants, the Court finds that Plaintiff has
demonstrated that Defendants’ subject appeal was frivolous for purposes of Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (c)(1).” (January 24, 2024 Order at p. 6:4-7.) 
The Court notes that in
their opposition to the Declaration of Robert Little filed on February 8, 2024,
the Opposing Parties argue that “under the circumstances in which
extrinsic fraud exists, Defendants’ anti-SLAPP motion(s) and appeal should not
be deemed frivolous and should not warrant any attorney’s fees or sanctions on
appeal or otherwise. The Court is respectfully urged to deny all of Plaintiff’s
attorney’s fees. (February 8, 2024 Opposition at p. 10:17-21.) 
As set forth above, the Court’s January 24, 2024 Order provides that “[t]he argument and evidence in
the supplemental papers are limited to the requested additional information, as
discussed above, and the response thereto. The parties may not include any
argument or evidence on any other issue.” (January 24, 2024 Order at p.
8:19-21.) The January 24, 2024 Order provides that “the Court will require a supplemental declaration from Plaintiff’s counsel more
clearly setting forth the fees incurred by Plaintiff in responding to
Defendant’s appeal. In addition, the Court will require additional information
concerning Mr. Little’s requested hourly rate.” (Id.
at p. 7:23-26.) Thus, the Court finds that the Opposing Parties’ arguments concerning
whether fees are recoverable are outside the scope of additional briefing
authorized by the January 24, 2024 Order. The Court thus declines to consider
such arguments.[2] 
As discussed in the January
24, 2024 Order, “[i]t is well established that the amount of an attorney
fee award under the anti-SLAPP statute is computed by the trial court in
accordance with the familiar lodestar method.” ((569 East County Boulevard LLC v.
Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 432
[internal quotations and brackets omitted].) Under the lodestar method, the court tabulates the
attorney fee lodestar by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended by
the reasonable hourly rate prevailing in the community for similar work.” (Ibid.)
With regard to the number of hours reasonably expended, “the verified
time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are entitled to
credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are erroneous.” ((Horsford
v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132
Cal.App.4th 359, 396.) In
determining the reasonable hourly rate, the “burden is on the successful party
to prove the appropriate market rate to be used in calculating the lodestar.” ((MBNA
America Bank, N.A. v. Gorman (2006) 147 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1, 13.) The trial court may reduce the
award where the fee request appears unreasonably inflated, such as where the
attorneys’ efforts are unorganized or duplicative. ((Serrano
v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635, fn. 21.)
In his supporting declaration, Plaintiff’s counsel states that his hourly rate “during the relevant course of events leading
up to and including filing this declaration was $510-600/hour.” (Kennedy Decl.,
¶ 11.) Plaintiff’s requested hourly rate for associate Nina Moreno is
$445/hour, and Plaintiff’s requested hourly rate for “of counsel” Robert M.
Dato is $550/hour. (Kennedy Decl., ¶¶ 13-14.) In his declaration filed on
January 31, 2024, Robert C. Little, Plaintiff’s counsel, states that “[f]rom
commencement to conclusion this appeal lasted over 21 months, from September
10, 2021, to June 14, 2023, as reflected on the Court of Appeal’s docket for
this matter…During that protracted period, my hourly rate ranged from $590
earlier in the case to $625 later in the case.” (Little Decl., ¶ 8.) Mr. Little
also states that “around September 2023, my client agreed to an increased but
still significantly discounted hourly rate of $680 for my time…” (Little Decl.,
¶ 9.)[3] 
The Court finds that the requested hourly rates are reasonable. “The courts repeatedly have stated that
the trial court is in the best position to value the services rendered by the
attorneys in his or her courtroom, and this includes the determination of the
hourly rate that will be used in the lodestar calculus.” ((569
East County Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc., supra, 6 Cal.App.5th at pp. 436-437
[internal citations omitted].) “In making its calculation, the court
may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity with the legal market, as well as
the experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting fees…” ((Id. at p.
437.) In addition, the Court notes that in their February 8, 2024
opposition, the Opposing Parties do not dispute Plaintiff’s requested hourly
rates. 
Next, in the notice of motion, Plaintiff states that he “seeks
$64,941.50 in fees for the appeal from the order denying Defendants’ frivolous
special motions to strike and $7,126.50 for this fee motion, for a total of
$72,068.00.” (Mot. at p. 3:11-13.) The Court’s January 24, 2024 minute order on
the instant motion provides, inter alia, as follows: 
 
“Plaintiff’s counsel also states
that ‘in connection with Defendants’ frivolous anti-SLAPP motions, Olson has
incurred at least about [sic] $64,941.50 in fees for at least 108.1 hours of
combined attorney time successfully defending against her [sic] multiple
(three) anti-SLAPP motions and defeating them. This required significant
analysis and opposition briefing involving a protracted and unwieldy procedural
history, supplemental briefing caused by Defendants, and preparing for and
attending multiple court hearings.’ (Kennedy Decl., ¶ 17.) But the instant
motion concerns fees sought by Plaintiff for ‘defending against Defendants’
appeals [sic] from the denials of their frivolous anti-SLAPP motions’ as well
as fees for ‘preparing and defending [the instant] fee motion.’ (Mot. at p.
5:28-6:1.) In light of paragraph 17 of Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration, it is
unclear whether Plaintiff purportedly incurred $64,941.50 in connection with
Plaintiff’s defense of Defendants’ appeal, or in connection with other matters
that are not the subject of the instant motion. Accordingly, the Court will require a
supplemental declaration from Plaintiff’s counsel more clearly setting forth the
fees incurred by Plaintiff in responding to Defendant’s appeal…” (January 24,
2024 Order at p. 7:11-24.)
In
his declaration in supplemental support of Plaintiff’s motion, Mr. Little
states that “[t]he inadvertent omission of two critical words —
‘on appeal’ — from paragraph 17 of Mr. Kennedy’s November 13, 2023 declaration
created confusion here. Having personally reviewed and redacted for privilege,
attorney work product, and relevance the invoices supporting my client’s
request for fees on appeal, and having performed the majority of the work in
connection with the appeal, I can clarify in connection with Defendants’
frivolous anti-SLAPP motions, that my client has incurred at least $64,941.50
in fees on appeal, representing at least 108.1 hours of combined attorney time
successfully defending and defeating — on appeal — Defendants’ multiple
anti-SLAPP motions.” (Little Decl., ¶ 10, emphasis omitted.) 
Mr. Little further states that “[t]hese were fees incurred for work
performed exclusively in connection with the appeal, and not in connection with
any earlier proceedings in the trial court or any other matters not related to
the appeal at the center of my client’s fee motion. For completeness, the
qualifier ‘at least’ $64,941.50 comes from the fact that I wrote off time
incurred working on my client’s appeal so that his request for fees on appeal
now represents the lowest reasonable amount possible based on my extensive
experience handling numerous appellate proceedings for many years now.” (Little
Decl., ¶ 10.) The Court notes that in their February 8, 2024 opposition, the
Opposing Parties do not challenge
any of Plaintiff’s billing entries. 
The Court finds that the requested $64,941.50 in fees on appeal are
reasonable. (Little Decl., ¶ 10; Kennedy Decl., ¶ 17, Ex. F.) 
Plaintiff also estimates he will incur an additional $7,126.50 in
connection with the instant motion, which includes “7.8 hours of Nina
Moreno’s time drafting this motion; 1.3 hours of Robert C. Little’s time
reviewing and revising the motion; plus an anticipated 4.7 hours of Nina
Moreno’s time reviewing the opposition and preparing the reply brief in support
of the motion; and 1 hour of Robert C. Little’s time appearing at the hearing…”
(Kennedy
Decl., ¶ 18.)  As discussed in the
Court’s January 24, 2024 Order, no opposition or reply¿was¿filed in
connection with the motion. Thus, the Court finds that the requested “4.7
hours of Nina Moreno’s time reviewing the opposition and preparing the reply
brief in support of the motion” shall be deducted from the total amount
requested. (Kennedy Decl., ¶ 18.) At Ms. Moreno’s rate of $445.00/hour,
the total amount deducted is $2,091.50 (4.7 x $445.00). As set forth above,
Plaintiff seeks a total of $72,068.00. This amount subtracted by $2,091.50
equals $69,976.50. 
Conclusion
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for statutory appellate attorney’s fees is
granted in the total amount of $69,976.50. ¿
Plaintiff is
ordered to give notice of this ruling.¿
