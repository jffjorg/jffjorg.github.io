And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied, in part, and granted, in part, the defendant's motion to deem the truth of the matters specified in the defendant's request for admissions, set one, served on the plaintiff deemed admitted and request for sanctions. The judge found that the proposed responses filed by the plaintiff were in substantial compliance with California Code of Civil Procedure § 2033.220, so the motion to deem the admissions was denied. However, the judge also found that the plaintiff failed to serve timely responses to the requests for admissions and therefore awarded sanctions in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiff in the amount of $1,060.00.
