And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has placed the defendants' motion to release deposited funds off calendar. The motion was filed by the Rowlands, who are seeking an order releasing the $10,000.00 in cash deposited with the court on November 19, 2018, per CCP 996.440. The judge has determined that the proof of service attached to the motion is defective and that the service is insufficient. Additionally, the judge has determined that the motion was filed on the same day as the orders of dismissal entered by the court, which is before the time for appeal from the dismissals had expired. Therefore, the judge has placed the motion off calendar.
