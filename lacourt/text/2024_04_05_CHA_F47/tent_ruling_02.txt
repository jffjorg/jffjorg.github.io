SUMMARY OF ACTION & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arose out of a dispute between neighboring
landowners Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants Anthony Fuschillo and Alicia Fuschillo
(the Fuschillos) and Defendants/Cross-Complainants James B. Rowland III and
Jessica R. Rowland (the Rowlands).  
 
On 9/20/18, the Fuschillos filed their complaint against
the Rowlands for: (1) adverse possession, (2) quiet title, (3) prescriptive
easement (in the alternative), (4) trespass, (5) trespass to chattels, and (6)
conversion.  
 
On 10/12/18, the Court granted the Fuschillos request for
a preliminary injunction and ordered them to post an undertaking in the amount
of $10,000.00.  (See 10/12/18
Minute Order; 11/1/18 Order on Preliminary Injunction).
 
On 10/22/18, the Rowlands filed their original
cross-complaint against the Fuschillos for: (1) trespass and (2) quiet
title.  On 12/27/18, the Rowlands filed
their amended cross-complaint alleging the same two causes of action.  On 11/9/18, the Fuschillos filed a notice of
posting the undertaking ordered by the Court. 

 
After several years of litigation, the matter was
scheduled for a jury trial on 3/11/24. 
On that day, pursuant to the oral request made by Plaintiff/the
Fuschillos, the Court ordered the Rowlands dismissed with prejudice from the
Fuschillos’ complaint.  (See
3/11/24 Minute Order).  Similarly, on
that date, pursuant to the request of Defendant/Cross-Complainant/the Rowlands,
the Court ordered the Fuschillos dismissed with prejudice from the Rowlands’
amended cross-complaint.  Id.
 
On 3/11/24, the Rowlands filed the instant motion seeking
an order releasing the $10,000.00 in cash deposited with the court on 11/19/18
to Defendants per CCP 996.440.  The proof
of service attached to the motion indicates that it was executed on 4/5/24 and
that the motion was served on the Fuschillos’ counsel by email/e-delivery on
4/5/24.  The date of execution and
service set forth in the proof of service could not be correct as the date had
not yet occurred at the time the motion was filed on 3/11/24.  As such, the proof of service is
defective.  No opposition has been filed.    
 
ANALYSIS 
 
CCP
996.440(b) provides, in part, that “[t]he motion shall not be made until after
entry of the final judgment in the action or proceeding in which the bond is given
and the time for appeal has expired or, if an appeal is taken, until the appeal
is finally determined.”  It is not clear
if the Rowlands are contending that the orders of dismissal entered by the
Court on 3/11/24 pursuant to the requests of the parties constitute the “final
judgment.”  If so, the instant motion was
filed the same day which is before the time for appeal from the dismissals expired.  See CRC 8.822.  
 
CCP
996.440(c) provides, in part, that “[n]otice of motion shall be served on the
principal and sureties at least 30 days before the time set for hearing of the
motion.”  Even if the date set forth in
the proof of service for the motion is a typographical error and the motion was
served on or around the time it was filed on 3/11/24, the service is
insufficient because it would not have been at least 30 days before the 4/5/24
hearing date.  No opposition or other
response to the motion has been filed to cure the defect in notice.      
 
CONCLUSION
 
Based
on the foregoing, the motion is placed off calendar.
