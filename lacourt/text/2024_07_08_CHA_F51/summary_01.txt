Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motions to compel further discovery responses from the defendant. The defendant had failed to provide code-compliant responses to the plaintiffs' discovery requests, including requests for production of documents and special interrogatories. The judge found that the defendant's objections to the discovery requests were without merit and failed to justify his non-compliance with the discovery requests.

The judge ordered the defendant to provide code-compliant, objection-free responses to the following discovery requests within 30 days:

* Plaintiffs' Demand for Production, Set One, Nos. 1-5 and 7-10
* Plaintiffs' Demand for Production, Set Three, Nos. 18-32
* Plaintiffs' Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 2-5, 18-27, 34-37, and 45-48
* Plaintiffs' Form Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 12.7, 13.1, 13.2, 15.1, 16.9, 16.10, 20.9, 20.10, and 20.11

The judge also imposed monetary sanctions against the defendant and his counsel in the amount of $2100.00, payable within 60 days. The judge awarded the plaintiffs an additional $5,950.00 in sanctions, which the defendant and his counsel were ordered to pay.
