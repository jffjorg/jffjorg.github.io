BACKGROUND
 
This is a personal injury action in which Plaintiffs, a
married couple, allege that on 12/19/20, plaintiffs Jaime Wotherspoon and
Pamela Baldwin-Lampman were standing in front of a lawfully parked truck when
Defendant rear-ended the truck with his vehicle, causing the truck to run over the
plaintiffs. (Compl. ¶¶ 7–9, 14–17.) On 12/8/22, Plaintiffs filed their
complaint, alleging against Defendant the following causes of action: (1)
Negligence; and (2) Loss of Consortium. On 5/25/23, plaintiffs Pamela
Baldwin-Lampman and Richard Lampman dismissed their claims without prejudice.
On 7/19/23, Defendant filed his answer. On 11/16/23, Defendant filed his
amended answer.
 
On 7/28/23, Plaintiffs served the subject discovery requests
on Defendant. (Decl. of Artur Aziev ¶ 2.) On 8/28/23, Defendant served his responses
thereto. (Id. at ¶ 3.) On 11/13/23, Plaintiffs filed the instant motions
to compel Defendant’s further responses to the subject discovery requests. Defendant’s
oppositions and Plaintiffs’ replies were filed as follows:

On 4/10/24, the Court continued the instant motions and
ordered the parties to further engage in meet and confer efforts to resolve
and/or narrow all outstanding discovery issues.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A.   
Meet and Confer 
 
A motion to compel further
discovery responses must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration stating “facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2030.300, subd. (b)(1); 2031.310, subd. (b)(2); 2016.040.) 
 
Here, Plaintiffs’ counsel declares
that on 10/16/23, 10/18/23, 10/19/23, counsel for the parties met and conferred
regarding the issues raised in the instant motion, but the parties were unable
to informally resolve the discovery dispute. (Aziev Decl. ¶¶ 4–8.) Following
the Court’s 4/10/24 order for the parties to engage in further meet and confer
efforts, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed an additional declaration stating that on
6/6/24, counsel for the parties met and conferred telephonically. (6/28/24
Aziev Decl. ¶ 10.) The parties agreed upon 6/20/24 as the deadline for
Defendant to provide further discovery responses; however, no further responses
have been provided to date. (Id. at ¶¶ 10–14.) Therefore, the Court
finds that counsel has satisfied the preliminary meet and confer requirement
under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.300, subdivision (b)(1) and
2031.310, subdivision (b)(2).
 
B.    
RFPs, Set
One
 
California law requires a responding party to respond to
each request for production of documents with either a statement of compliance,
a representation that the party lacks the ability to comply, or an objection to
the demand. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.210, subd. (a).)
 
If the response includes an objection to the demand in
part, it must also include a statement of compliance or noncompliance as set
forth above. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240, subd. (a).) Additionally, the
response must (1) identify the particular document that falls within the
category of the request to which the objection is being made, and (2) expressly
set forth the extent of, and specific ground for, the objection. (Id.,
subd. (b).)¿A propounding party may move for an order compelling further
response to a request for production if it decides that “an objection in the
response is without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310, subd.
(a).) The demanding party must take the initiative to obtain a judicial
determination of the validity of any objection by moving to compel a further
response, but the objecting party has the burden of justifying the objection. (See,
e.g., Coy v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (1962) 58 Cal.2d
210, 220.)
 
Here, Plaintiffs seek to compel Defendant’s additional
responses to RFP Nos. 1–5 and 7–10, arguing
that Defendant’s responses are not code-compliant and his objections thereto
are without merit. The subject requests seek “documents related to the
incident, such as various reports, documents showing property damage, if any,
and insurance documents concerning claims for personal injuries of the parties
to the case. … [and] documents related to Defendant’s driving record.” (Pls.’ RFP1 Mot. 4:19–21.)
 
While Defendant argues that he provided supplemental
responses on 2/20/24, with verifications served on 5/13/24, Plaintiffs maintain
that “Defendant’s responses to RFP Nos. 7–9 fall short of the standard under
section 2031.230, and for that reason, remain noncompliant with the Code. In
addition, Defendant failed to provide any further response to RFP Nos. 1–5, and
10, which to this day rely on improper objections, including privilege
objections.” (Pls.’ RFP1 Reply, 3:6–10.) 
Specifically, Defendant’s additional responses state that the responsive
documents are not within Defendant’s possession, but failed to identify “any
natural person or organization known or believed by that party to have
possession, custody, or control of that item or category of item.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2031.230.)
 
The Court also notes that Defendant has wholly failed to
meet his burden to justify the objections asserted in his discovery responses. Based
on the foregoing, the Court finds that Defendant’s initial and supplemental
responses to Plaintiffs’ RFP Nos. 1–5 and 7–10 are not code-compliant,
and that his boilerplate objections are without merit. Accordingly, the Court
grants Plaintiffs’ motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to
Plaintiffs’ Demand for Production, Set One, Nos. 1–5 and 7–10.
 
C.   
RFPs, Set
Three
 
Here, Plaintiffs seek to compel Defendant’s additional
responses to RFP Nos. 18–32, arguing that
Defendant’s responses are not code-compliant and his objections thereto are
without merit. The subject requests seek “information and documents
about Defendant’s cell-phone records as they relate to his reasoning skills and
decision-making ability leading up to the incident and at the time of the
incident.” (Pls.’ RFP3 Mot. 4:19–20.)
 
Here, Defendant argues that he provided supplemental
responses on 3/5/24, with verifications served on 5/13/24, but Plaintiffs
maintain that “Defendant failed to follow his own statement of compliance
promising to produce the outstanding records” in response to RFP Nos. 18, 19,
and 22–31. (Pls.’ RFP3 Reply, 4:14–15.) The Court again notes that Defendant
has failed to meet his burden to justify the objections asserted in his
discovery responses. 
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Defendant’s
initial and supplemental responses to Plaintiffs’ RFP Nos. 18–32 are not
code-compliant, and that his boilerplate objections are without merit.
Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiffs’ motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Plaintiffs’ Demand for Production, Set Three, Nos. 18–32.
 
D.   
Special
Interrogatories, Set One
 
“The party to whom interrogatories have been propounded
shall respond in writing under oath separately to each interrogatory by any of
the following: (1) An answer containing the information sought to be
discovered; (2) An exercise of the party’s option to produce writings; or (3)
An objection to the particular interrogatory.” (Code Civ Proc. § 2030.210,
subd. (a).) “Each answer in a response to interrogatories shall be as complete
and straightforward as the information reasonably available to the responding
party permits.” (Code Civ Proc. § 2030.220.) “If an objection is made to an
interrogatory or to a part of an interrogatory, the specific ground for the
objection shall be set forth clearly in the response. If an objection is based
on a claim of privilege, the particular privilege invoked shall be clearly
stated.” (Code Civ Proc. § 2030.240, subd. (b).)
 
A propounding party may move
for an order compelling further responses to interrogatories if any of the
following apply: “(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete; (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section
2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is
inadequate; or (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too
general.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300, subd. (a).)
 
Here, Plaintiffs seek to compel Defendant’s additional
responses to Special Interrogatory Nos. 1–5, 18–27, 34–37, and 45–48,
arguing that Defendant’s responses are evasive, incomplete, and his objections
are without merit. “Special Interrogatories
Nos. 1–5 and 18–27 ask Defendant whether he contends that he was not
responsible for causing the incident, whether he used a cell phone during the
timeframe relevant to the incident, and to identify any evidence in support of
his contentions.” (Pls.’ SPROG1 Mot. 8:11–13.) “Interrogatories
Nos. 18–27 and 34–37 also seek a ‘yes or no’ answer as to Defendant’s use of
his personal cell phone on the day of the incident at relevant times.” (Id. at
8:15–17.) “Special Interrogatories Nos. 45–48 are also contention
interrogatories.” (Id. at 8:23.)
 
In opposition, Defendant asserts that he served
supplemental responses on 2/20/24, with verifications served on 5/13/24, but
Plaintiffs argue that Defendant’s supplemental responses “failed to
address the defects with interrogatories Nos. 2–5, 18–27, 34–37, and did not
supplement any responses to Nos. 45–48.” (Defs.’ SPROG1 Reply, 2:18–19.) The Court again notes that Defendant has failed to meet his
burden to justify the objections asserted in his discovery responses. 
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Defendant’s
initial and supplemental responses to Plaintiffs’ Special Interrogatory Nos. 2–5,
18–27, 34–37, and 45–48 are not code-compliant, and that his boilerplate
objections are without merit. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiffs’ motion
to compel Defendant’s further responses to Plaintiffs’ Special Interrogatories,
Set One, Nos. 2–5, 18–27, 34–37, and 45–48.
 
E.    
Form
Interrogatories, Set One
 
Here, Plaintiffs seek to compel Defendant’s additional
responses to Form Interrogatory Nos. 12.1, 12.7, 13.1, 13.2, 14.2, 15.1,
16.9, 16.10, and 20.2–11. The subject interrogatories
seek the identities of witnesses to the subject incident, whether Defendant
conducted surveillance on any individuals involved, whether any person was
cited or charged with a violation of any statute, ordinance, or regulation as a
result of the subject incident, facts supporting Defendant’s affirmative
defenses, whether Defendant has documents concerning Plaintiffs’ claims for
personal injuries, and information about the vehicles involved in collision,
location and route to which Defendant was headed, and conditions of the place
of the collision.
 
Defendant asserts that he served supplemental responses to
the subject form interrogatories on 2/20/24, with verifications served on
5/13/24, but Plaintiffs argue that “although Defendant produced further
responses to some interrogatories on February 20, 2024, Defendant refused to
supplement any response to [form] interrogatories Nos. 12.7, 13.1, 13.2, 15.1,
16.9, 16.10, 20.9, 20.10, and 20.11.” (Defs.’ FROG1 Reply, 1:6–8.) The Court again
notes that Defendant has failed to meet his burden to justify the objections
asserted in his discovery responses. 
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Defendant’s
initial and supplemental responses to Plaintiffs’ Form Interrogatory Nos. 12.7,
13.1, 13.2, 15.1, 16.9, 16.10, 20.9, 20.10, and 20.11 are not
code-compliant, and that his boilerplate objections are without merit.
Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiffs’ motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Plaintiffs’ Form Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 12.7, 13.1, 13.2, 15.1, 16.9, 16.10, 20.9, 20.10, and 20.11.
 
F.    
Sanctions 
 
“The court shall impose a
monetary sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories [or RFPs],
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310,
subd. (h).) Additionally, “the court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney
advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
 
Here, Plaintiffs
request a total combined sum of $5,950.00
in monetary sanctions against Defendant and
his counsel, which encompasses: (1) 10 hours of Plaintiffs’ attorney’s time
spent across all four motions; (2) an anticipated 5 hours reviewing Defendant’s
oppositions and drafting Plaintiffs’ replies; and (3) an anticipated 2 hours
preparing for and attending the instant hearings, at counsel’s hourly billing
rate of $350.00 per hour. In granting the instant motions, the Court finds it
reasonable to award Plaintiffs monetary sanctions in the amount of $2100.00. against Defendant and his counsel.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The
motions are granted. Defendant ordered to provide code-compliant,
objection-free responses to the following discovery requests within 30 days:
·        
Plaintiffs’
RFPs, Set One, Nos. 1–5 and 7–10;

Plaintiffs’
RFPs, Set Three, Nos. 18–32;

The
Court imposes monetary sanctions against Defendant and/or his counsel in the
amount of $2100. 00 payable within 60 days.
