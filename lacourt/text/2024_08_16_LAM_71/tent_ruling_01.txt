JEFFREY ITO,  
  
         vs.
 
USC
  DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY.


 Case No.: 
  23STCV17350
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  August 16, 2024



 
Defendant
University of Southern California’s demurrer to pro per Plaintiff Jeffrey
Ito’s Complaint is denied as moot.
Defendant’s
unopposed motion to strike is denied as moot.
 
          Defendant University
of Southern California [erroneously sued as USC Department of Public Safety]
(“USC”) (“Defendant”) demurs to pro per Plaintiff Jeffrey Ito’s (“Ito”)
(“Plaintiff”) complaint (“Complaint”). 
(Notice of Demurrer, pg. 2; C.C.P. §430.10(e).)
          Defendant
also moves unopposed to strike portions of Plaintiff’s Complaint.  (Notice of MTS, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §§435, 436.)
 
1.    
Demurrer
Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer, the
moving party must meet and confer in person, by
telephone, or by video conference with the party who
filed the pleading to attempt to reach an agreement that would resolve the objections
to the pleading and obviate the need for filing the demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41, emphasis added.) 
Defendant’s counsel declares that
on June 7, 2024, she sent a letter via email to Plaintiff in an effort to meet
and confer.  (Decl. of Hogoboom ¶5,
Exh. B.)  Defendant’s counsel
declares Plaintiff has not responded to Defendant’s meet and confer
correspondence.  (Decl. of Hogoboom
¶7.)  Defendant is in violation of C.C.P.
§430.41 because it did not attempt to meet and confer with Plaintiff in person,
by telephone, or by video conference. 
However, failure to sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to
overrule or sustain a demurrer.  (C.C.P.
§430.41(a)(4); Dumas v. Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors (2020)
45 Cal.App.5th 348, 355; Olson v. Hornbrook Community Services District
(2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 502, 515.) 
Accordingly, the Court will consider Defendant’s demurrer.
 
          Background
          Plaintiff
filed his initial Complaint on July 25, 2023. 
On January 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative first amended
complaint (“FAC”) against Defendant. 
          Defendant
filed the instant demurrer to the initial Complaint on January 12, 2024.  Plaintiff filed his opposition on August 5,
2024.  As of the date of this hearing no
reply has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a
complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385,
388.)  A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Insurance Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider
declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted
for the truth of their contents].)  For
purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed
to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of
law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital
District (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Discussion
Defendant’s
demurrer to the initial Complaint is denied as moot because the operative
pleading is the FAC, filed on January 26, 2024.
 
          Conclusion
Defendant’s
demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint is denied as moot.
Moving Party to
give notice.
 
2.     Motion to Strike
In light of this
Court’s ruling on the demurrer, Defendant’s unopposed motion to strike
portions of Plaintiff’s Complaint is denied as moot.
