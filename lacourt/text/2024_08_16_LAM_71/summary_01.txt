And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the University of Southern California (USC) Department of Public Safety to the complaint filed by Jeffrey Ito, a pro per plaintiff. The demurrer was filed on January 12, 2024, and the judge has determined that it is moot because the operative pleading is the First Amended Complaint filed on January 26, 2024. The judge has also denied USC's unopposed motion to strike portions of Plaintiff's Complaint as moot. The judge notes that USC did not attempt to meet and confer with Plaintiff in person, by telephone, or by video conference, which is a requirement under California Code of Civil Procedure (C.C.P.) §430.41. However, the judge will still consider the demurrer and has denied it. The judge further notes that the sufficiency of Plaintiff's Complaint will be determined based on the facts pleaded in the complaint, which are assumed to be true for purposes of ruling on the demurrer.
