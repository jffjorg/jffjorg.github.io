[1] The
Court notes that the proof of service for the motion compelling responses to
Demands for Production, Set One, contains a name and address other than
Plaintiff’s attorney of record. However, the proof of services for the
remaining motions show that Plaintiff’s counsel received notice. Seeing as
Plaintiff has not filed an opposition, the Court excuses the defect absent any
prejudice to Plaintiff.
