And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling denies Plaintiff's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The Plaintiff seeks to add new causes of action and a new plaintiff to the case. The motion does not meet the procedural requirements of the California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, as it does not specify the effect of the amendment, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered, and why the request for amendment was not made earlier. The Court finds that the motion is denied due to the Plaintiff's failure to provide the required information.
