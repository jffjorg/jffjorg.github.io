Motion
  to Set Aside and Vacate Dismissal

None



 
BACKGROUND
 
On July 15, 2022, Plaintiff Adolfo Muro Arambula (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Defendants Southern California Pizza, Pizza Hut, Maria
Fernanda Hernandez Mendez, and Does 1 to 20 for negligence related to a motor
vehicle accident. The complaint alleges that Maria Fernanda Hernandez Mendez
was driving and acting within the scope of her employment with Southern
California Pizza and Pizza Hut. (Complaint, 4.)
 
On February 28, 2024, Plaintiff and Pizza Hut filed a stipulation to
dismiss Pizza Hut from this case on the representation that the subject Pizza
Hut branded restaurant at issue was owned by franchisee Southern California
Pizza Company, LLC. (Stip. filed 2/28/24, ¶ 2.) The parties agreed to toll the
statute of limitations while Plaintiff investigates and preserves the right to
assert claims against Pizza Hut in the future. 
 
Also on February 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for dismissal,
dismissing the complaint without prejudice.
 
On February 29, 2024, at an OSC re: monetary sanctions for failure to
enter default as to Defendant Pizza Hut, the Court ordered Pizza Hut to be
dismissed from the complaint without prejudice, pursuant to Plaintiff’s oral
request. (Min. Order, 2/29/24.) 
 
On March 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to set aside and vacate
the dismissal of the entire complaint, entered on February 29, 2024, pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). No opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 473(b), the Court may relieve a party from a
dismissal taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.  This application must
be filed no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is
sought, and must contain an affidavit of fault demonstrating the moving party’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. 
 
A mistake
is a basis for relief under section 473 when by reason of the mistake a party
failed to make a timely response.  Surprise occurs when a party is
unexpectedly placed in a position to his injury without any negligence of his
own. Excusable neglect is a basis for relief when the party has shown some
reasonable excuse for the default.  (Credit Managers Association of
California v. National Independent Business Alliance (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d
1166, 1173; Davis v. Thayer (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 892, 905.)  Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, the moving party bears the burden of
demonstrating an excusable ground, such as fraud or mistake, justifying a
court’s vacating a judgment.  (Basinger v. Roger & Wells (1990)
220 Cal.App.3d 16, 23–24.)   
 
Relief under
this section is mandatory when based on an attorney affidavit of fault;
otherwise, it is discretionary. (Id.) Mandatory relief is only available
when a party fails to oppose a dismissal motion (“which are procedurally
equivalent to a default”). (Leader v. Health Industries of America,
Inc. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 603, 620.) With an
attorney affidavit of fault, there is no requirement that the attorney’s
mistake or inadvertence be excusable. (Vaccaro v. Kaiman (1998) 63
Cal.App.4th 761, 770.) The affidavit also does not need to contain a reason for
the mistake. (Martin Potts & Associates, Inc. v. Corsair, LLC (2016)
244 Cal.App.4th 432, 438.) Additionally, since an attorney is responsible for
supervising the work of legal assistants, an error by an employee is considered
the attorney’s error for purposes of section 473(b) relief. (Hu v. Fang (2002)
104 Cal.App.4th 61, 64 [paralegal’s error in calendaring an OSC hearing was
attributable to the attorney and subject to mandatory relief].) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Procedurally,
the present motion is timely because it was filed within six months after the
dismissal. 
 
            Plaintiff
asserts that after the February 29, 2024 OSC hearing, Plaintiff filed a Request
for Dismissal with the Court and failed to check the “Other” box on CIV-110
form, Section 1. b. (6) to indicate that the dismissal was only as to Defendant
Pizza Hut. (Medina Decl. ¶ 10.) Therefore, Plaintiff contends he inadvertently
dismissed the entire case. 
 
            The request
for dismissal that Plaintiff describes appears to have been filed on February
28, 2024, and was entered on February 29, 2024. In it, Plaintiff requested that
the complaint be dismissed without prejudice. The Declaration of Ivan Medina states
that this was a mistake as Plaintiff intended only to dismiss Pizza Hut
pursuant to the stipulation filed that same day. (Medina Decl. ¶ 10.)
Therefore, because it appears this dismissal was due to mistake and
inadvertence, the motion to set aside the dismissal entered on February 29,
2024 as to the entire complaint, is granted. This order does not affect the order
of dismissal filed and entered on February 29, 2024 that applies only to Pizza
Hut. 
             
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
Therefore, the Court GRANTS the motion to set aside dismissal. Trial Setting Conference is scheduled for June 20, 2024, at 08:30 a.m. in Department 32, Spring Street Courthouse.
 
Plaintiff to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
