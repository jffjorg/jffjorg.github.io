Motion
  for Terminating Sanctions   




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant/Cross-complainant Nestor
  Cabrera




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiffs
Alejandra Guzman (“Alejandra”), Joanna Guzman (“Joanna”), and Miguel Angel
Moto, Jr. (“Moto”) sued defendant Nestor Cabrera and Does 1 to 50 for motor
vehicle negligence in connection with an auto accident that occurred on
February 4, 2022. 
 
Defendant/Cross-complainant
Nestor Cabrera (“Defendant”) moves for terminating sanctions against
Plaintiffs
Alejandra Guzman, Joanna Guzman, and Miguel Angel Moto, Jr.  (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) for failure to
comply with the Court’s discovery orders on the following days: August 24,
2023, October 5, 2023, and October 12, 2023. Alternatively, Defendant seeks
monetary sanctions. No opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“To
the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method
or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected
party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may
impose…sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the
discovery process.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 2023.030.) The court may impose a
terminating sanction for misuse of the discovery process by any of the
following: “(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings
of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process; (2) An order
staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed; (3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that
party; (4) An order rendering a judgment by default against that party.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(d).)  Failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery, or
disobeying
a court order to provide discovery, constitutes a
misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d), (g).)

 
“The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse
‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the
party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the
propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the
discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 377, 390,
quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 1225, 1246.)   
 
“Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be
made lightly.  But where a violation is
willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’” (Los Defensores,
supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390 [citation omitted].)    
 
“Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating
sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders.”
(Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 citing Lang, supra, 77
Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244-1246 [discussing cases]; see, e.g., Collisson &
Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 [terminating
sanctions imposed (by striking the defendant’s Answer and subsequently granting
default judgment) after defendants failed to comply with one court order to
produce discovery]; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 481, 491, disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen (1997)
16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4 [terminating sanctions imposed against the plaintiff
for failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating various
discovery statutes].)  
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290(c), “[i]f a party then
fails to obey an order compelling [interrogatory] answers, the court may make
those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).”

 
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300(c), “[i]f a party then fails to obey
the order compelling a response [to requests for production], the court may
make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction,
an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court
may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010).” 
 
DISCUSSION
 
On
August 24, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s motions to compel interrogatories.
Plaintiffs Moto and Alejandra were ordered to provide responses without
objections within 20 days. The Court imposed monetary sanctions. Defendant
served notice on Plaintiffs’ then-counsel on August 25, 2023. 
 
On
October 5, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s motions to compel
interrogatories and demand for production. Plaintiffs Moto and Alejandra were
ordered to provide verified responses within 20 days. The Court imposed
monetary sanctions. 
 
On
October 12, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s motions to compel form
interrogatories and demands for production. Plaintiff Joanna was ordered to
serve responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and demand
for production, within 20 days. Plaintiff Alejandra was ordered to serve
responses to demand for production within 20 days. The Court also imposed
monetary sanctions. Defendant served notice of the rulings on Plaintiffs’
then-counsel on October 17, 2023. 
 
On
December 5, 2023, the Court entered orders relieving Plaintiffs’ then-counsel. Plaintiffs
have not appeared in this action since and have not indicated they are
represented by counsel. 
 
Defendant
filed the instant motion for terminating sanctions on April 8, 2024, and has
provided notice to Plaintiffs’ addresses indicated in the orders relieving
counsel. Defendant argues that Plaintiffs have not complied with the Court’s
previous discovery orders. The discovery was first served on December 12, 2022.
(Arnold Decl. ¶ 3.) Since then, no responses have been served. (Id. ¶
9.) On March 15, 2024, Defendant’s counsel wrote to Plaintiffs in pro per advising
them of the orders, and informing them if no response was provided, she would
move for terminating sanctions. (Id. ¶ 11.) Plaintiffs did not respond
to the letter or provide responses. (Id. ¶ 12.)
 
Therefore,
it appears that discovery was first served in December 2022, and the motions to
compel were granted in August and October of 2023. This delay in time
demonstrates that Defendant has been prevented from mounting a defense against
this case. Considering this, the fact Plaintiffs do not oppose this motion,
Defendant has attempted to informally obtain discovery, and monetary sanctions
have been ineffective, the Court finds Plaintiffs’ actions to be willful.
Therefore, the motion for terminating sanctions is granted. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Therefore,
Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions is GRANTED. The only remaining
defendants are Doe Defendants who have not been named or served, and therefore
the Court
orders the complaint dismissed in its entirety.
 
The Final Status
Conference and Jury Trial dates are advanced and vacated. 
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
