[1] Defendant
discusses Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 throughout its motion.
However, that section only applies where a deponent fails to appear for
deposition. Here, it appears Plaintiff attended the deposition, but just failed
to give complete responses. Therefore, section 2025.480, which Defendant cites
in the motion, is more appropriate.
