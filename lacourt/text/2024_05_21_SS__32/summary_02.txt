```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered Plaintiff Breanna Sprunger's motion for reconsideration of the dismissal without prejudice of her case. The court finds that Plaintiff did not make an application for an order that was then denied, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. Instead, Plaintiff's counsel arrived late to the courthouse on the day of the scheduled trial, and the case was dismissed without prejudice. The court also finds that Plaintiff has failed to show how the fact he was late constitutes a new "fact" to warrant reconsideration of the dismissal. Therefore, the court denies Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration.
