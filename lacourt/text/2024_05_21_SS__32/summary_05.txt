And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions against the plaintiffs. The defendant had filed the motion for terminating sanctions after the plaintiffs failed to comply with the court's discovery orders. The court had previously granted the defendant's motions to compel interrogatories and demands for production, but the plaintiffs had failed to respond to the discovery requests. The court finds that the plaintiffs' actions were willful and that the defendant had attempted to informally obtain the discovery. The court also finds that the plaintiffs' failure to comply with the discovery orders had prevented the defendant from mounting a defense against the case. The court grants the motion for terminating sanctions and orders the complaint dismissed in its entirety.
