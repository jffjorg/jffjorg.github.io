subpoenas served by Defendants on (1) Kaiser Foundation/SCPMG – Radiology ROI
Unit located in Anaheim California, (2) Kaiser Foundation Hospital/SCPMG ROI
located in Rancho Cucamonga, and (3) So. California Permanente Medical Group-Billing.

 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Linda
Planinanc’s claim, by and through her successor-in-interest Anthony Planinac (“Plaintiff”),
that she suffered elder abuse. Plaintiff alleges she was a resident of Sunland
SNF, LLC (“Sunland”). Plaintiff alleges Sunland failed to provide proper care
and supervision causing her to suffer from septic shock. Plaintiff alleges that
Defendants’ improper care caused her to be in poor condition in April of 2023,
causing her to require medical care. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff’s motion to quash
Defendants’ subpoenas served on (1) Kaiser Foundation/SCPMG – Radiology ROI
Unit located in Anaheim California, (2) Kaiser Foundation Hospital/SCPMG ROI
located in Rancho Cucamonga, and (3) So. California Permanente Medical Group-Billing
is GRANTED.
 
The subpoenas are ordered
quashed in their entirety. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
“Any consumer whose personal records are
sought by a subpoena duces tecum and who is a party to the civil action in
which this subpoena duces tecum is served may, prior to the date for
production, bring a motion under Section 1987.1 to quash or modify the subpoena
duces tecum. Notice of the bringing of that motion shall be given to the
witness and deposition officer at least five days prior to production. The
failure to provide notice to the deposition officer shall not invalidate the
motion to quash or modify the subpoena duces tecum but may be raised by the
deposition officer as an affirmative defense in any action for liability for
improper release of records.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 1985.3, subd. (g).)
 
            Code of Civil Procedure
section 1987.1, subdivision (a), provides: “If a subpoena requires the
attendance of a witness or the production of books, documents, electronically stored information, or other
things before a court, or at the trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of
a deposition, the court, upon motion reasonably made by any person described in
subdivision (b), or upon the court's own motion after giving counsel notice and
an opportunity to be heard, may make an order quashing the subpoena entirely,
modifying it, or directing compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as
the court shall declare, including protective orders. In addition, the court
may make any other order as may be appropriate to protect the person from
unreasonable or oppressive demands, including unreasonable violations of the
right of privacy of the person.” 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff
moves to quash three subpoenas for her medical records on the grounds that the
subpoenas seek private and protected information. 
 
            The first subpoena at
issue was served on Kaiser Foundation Hospital located at 1011 South East
Street Anaheim and stated: “THE RECORDS REQUESTED ARE regardless of date FOR
THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF RECORDS: ANY AND ALL FILMS, ORIGINAL X-RAY FILMS, CT
SCANS AND MRI FILMS, INCLUDING ANY FILMS/IMAGES THAT MAY BE STORED DIGITALLY
AND/OR ELECTRONICALLY RELATING TO LINDA CATHERINE PLANINANC . . ..” 
 
            The second subpoena was
served on Kaiser Foundation Hospital located on 4th Street Rancho Cucamonga and
stated: “THE RECORDS REQUESTED ARE regardless of date FOR THE FOLLOWING TYPES
OF RECORDS: ANY AND ALL MEDICAL RECORDS, DOCUMENTS, MEDICAL REPORTS, INCLUDING
DOCTORS’ ENTRIES, NURSING CHARTS, PROGRESS REPORTS, PHYSICAL THERAPY RECORDS,
PATHOLOGY REPORTS, X-RAY REPORTS, LAB REPORTS, CASE HISTORY, EMERGENCY ROOM,
RECORDS, ADMITTING SHEETS, SPECIAL TESTS, INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT RECORDS, AND
ANY SIGN-IN SHEETS, ANY AND ALL PHARMACY/PRESCRIPTION RECORDS, ACTIVITY RX
NOTES, INCLUDING PRESCRIPTIONS FILLED AND REFILLED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO ANY RECORDS/DOCUMENTS THAT MAY BE STORED DIGITALLY AND/OR ELECTRONICALLY
INCLUDING ALL PATIENT ORDERS AND PATIENT RESULTS AND SPECIFICALLY FOR ANY
DISCHARGE ORDERS, ALL DETAILED SCREEN SHOTS WITHIN ANY COMPUTER SYSTEM
PERTAINING TO THE CARE AND TREATMENT, DIAGNOSIS, PROGNOSIS, CONDITION,
DISCHARGE, AFFECTING OR RELATING TO LINDA CATHERINE PLANINAC. . ..”
 
            The third subpoena was
served in So. California Permanente Medical Group-Billing located at 10740 4th
Street, Rancho Cucamonga and stated: “THE RECORDS REQUESTED ARE regardless of
date FOR THE FOLLOWING TYPE OF RECORDS: ANY AND ALL BILLINGS, STATEMENT OF
CHARGES, STATEMENTS OF ACCOUNTS, WRITING, AND DOCUMENTS REFLECTING THE
FOLLOWING: ANY AND ALL PAYMENTS MADE OR RECEIVED, ANY AND ALL CREDITS,
ADJUSTMENTS, WRITE-OFFS, RECONO0LICATIONS, CONTRACT PRICE PAYMENTS OR
REDUCTION, PAYMENT BY ANY HEALTH INSURANCE ENTITY, PERSONAL PAYMENTS BY OR TO

BY ANY ENTITY CONCERNING SAID PATIENT, BILLING LEDGERS, REPORTS AND/OR
STATEMENTS OF CHARGES RENDERED AND ANY INSURANCE RECORDS, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO ANY RECORDS/DOCUMENTS THAT MAY BE STORED DIGITALLY AND/OR
ELECTRONICALLY THIS REQUEST FOR RECORDS INCLUDES ANY AND ALL EVIDENCE OF
PAYMENTS FROM ANY SOURCE REGARDING THE ACCOUNT OF THIS PATIENT TO OR FROM ANY
PERSON AND/OR ENTITY, IN REFERENCE TO LINDA CATHERINE PLANINAC . . ..” 
 
            “ ‘California law
provides parties with expansive discovery rights.” [Citation.] Thus, ‘[u]nless
otherwise limited’ by a court order, ‘any party may obtain discovery regarding
any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in
the pending action ... , if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence
or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence.’ ” (Ross v. Superior Court of Riverside County (2022) 77
Cal.App.5th 667, 679.)
 
The California Constitution
provides Californians with a right to privacy. (Cal. Const., art. 1, section
1.) The California Supreme Court has held that “[t]he party asserting a
privacy right must establish a legally protected privacy interest, an
objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the given circumstances, and a
threatened intrusion that is serious.” (Williams v. Superior Court (2017)
3 Cal.5th 531, 552 (“Williams”), citing Hill v. National Collegiate
Athletic Assn. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, 35.) “The party seeking information may
raise in response whatever legitimate and important countervailing interests
disclosure serves, while the party seeking protection may identify feasible
alternatives that serve the same interests or protective measures that would
diminish the loss of privacy. A court must then balance these competing
considerations.” (Ibid.)
 
            “The Hill test, conceived in the context of a pleaded
cause of action for invasion of privacy, has been applied more broadly,
including to circumstances where litigation requires a court to reconcile
asserted privacy interests with competing claims for access to third party
contact information.” (Williams, supra, 3 Cal.5th at p. 552.) 
 
            Plaintiff seeks to
quash subpoenas seeking records related to her medical records. 
 
            It is “well-settled”
that patients “have a right to privacy with respect to information contained in
. . . medical records.” (Grafilo v. Wolfsohn (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 1024,
1034.) “Medical patients’ privacy interest, our Supreme Court has observed,
derives from their expectation of privacy in their physician's files, which
‘may include descriptions of symptoms, family history, diagnoses, test results,
and other intimate details concerning treatment.’ ” (Ibid.) “ ‘The
information that may be recorded in a doctor's files is broad[-]ranging. The
chronology of ailments and treatment is potentially sensitive. Patients may
disclose highly personal details of lifestyle and information concerning
sources of stress and anxiety. These are matters of great sensitivity going to
the core of the concerns for the privacy of information about an
individual.’ ” (County of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (2021) 65
Cal.App.5th 621, 640-41.)
 
            The documents
Defendants seek to obtain through the three subpoenas are medical records, and Plaintiff
had a legally protected privacy interest. Further, Plaintiff has established an
objectively reasonable expectation of privacy. “[P]laintiffs are ‘not obligated
to sacrifice all privacy to seek redress for a specific (physical,) mental or
emotional injury’; while they may not withhold information which relates to any
physical or mental condition which they have put in issue by bringing this
lawsuit, they are entitled to retain the confidentiality of all unrelated
medical or psychotherapeutic treatment they may have undergone in the past.” (Britt
v. Superior Court (1978) 20 Cal.3d 844, 864.)
 
            Lastly, Plaintiff has
demonstrated a serious threatened intrusion. Plaintiff’s claims alleged are
related to improper care resulting in her poor condition necessitating medical
care in April of 2023. However, Defendants’ subpoenas seek medical records
“regardless of date” and seek an vast variety of documents with no attempt to
limit the discovery of private information to that related to the present case.
Defendants’ subpoenas seek Plaintiff’s medical records in violation of her
privacy rights. Defendants have failed to respond to the present motion and
have also therefore failed to raise legitimate and important countervailing
interests supporting disclosure. 
 
            Plaintiff’s motion to
quash the three subpoenas as GRANTED. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff’s motion to quash Defendants’
subpoenas served on (1) Kaiser Foundation/SCPMG – Radiology ROI Unit located in
Anaheim California, (2) Kaiser Foundation Hospital/SCPMG ROI located in Rancho
Cucamonga, and (3) So. California Permanente Medical Group-Billing is GRANTED.
 
The subpoenas are ordered
quashed in their entirety. 
 
NOTE 
            The court notes that there are
currently 11 discovery motions on the calendar. 
At the hearing the court will discuss whether an IDC should be conducted,
or a Discovery referee appointed.  The parties
are ordered to meet and confer on this question.  Be prepared to update the court on those
discussions.
