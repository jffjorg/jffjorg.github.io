Summary:

The subpoenas seek medical records from Kaiser Foundation Hospital, SCPMG, and So. California Permanente Medical Group-Billing. The judge finds that Plaintiff has established a legally protected privacy interest, an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy, and a threatened intrusion that is serious. The judge also finds that the subpoenas seek a vast variety of documents with no attempt to limit the discovery of private information to that related to the present case, violating Plaintiff's privacy rights. The judge orders the subpoenas quashed in their entirety.
