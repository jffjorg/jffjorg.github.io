And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on Defendant James Pakulis' motion to vacate an order and rule on his motion for an order directing the clerk to file his proposed settled statement nunc pro tunc. The motion was filed on May 28, 2024, and the court has already addressed the issue at a hearing on May 6, 2024, and again at a hearing on June 14, 2024. The court held that Defendant's filings lacked proper proofs of service and directed Defendant to properly file and serve his proposed settled statement. The court considered Defendant's statement and requested that Plaintiff file a response on June 7, 2024. The court then issued a finalized statement on June 17, 2024. Based on these facts, the judge finds that there is no need to rule again on the nunc pro tunc filing, as the issue is moot because the court has already issued a finalized statement. Therefore, the motion is denied.
