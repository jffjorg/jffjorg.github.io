     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant’s motion to expunge lis
  pendens 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On June 14, 2023, Plaintiff Abigail
Rodriguez filed this action against Defendant Susan V. Wopschall-Wengel,
asserting causes of action for (1) breach of contract, (2) promissory estoppel,
(3) quiet title, (4) specific performance, and (5) declaratory relief. 
The complaint alleges that the parties
entered into an agreement for the sale of a home in Covina, California and that
Defendant has failed to perform the conditions required on her part to complete
the transaction. 
            On June 23, 2023, Plaintiff recorded
a lis pendens on the subject property.
            On May 28, 2024, Defendant filed the
instant motion to expunge the lis pendens. Plaintiff filed her opposition on
June 11, 2024. Defendant filed her reply on June 21, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
A lis pendens is a recorded document
giving constructive notice that an action has been filed affecting title or
right to possession of the real property described in the notice. (La Jolla
Group II v. Bruce (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 461, 473.) A lis pendens may be
filed by any party in an action who asserts a “real property claim.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 405.20.) A “real property claim” means “the cause or causes of action
in a pleading which would, if meritorious, affect [] title to, or the right to
possession of, specific real property.” (Id., § 405.4.)
At any time after the lis pendens has been
recorded, a property owner may bring a motion to expunge an improperly recorded
lis pendens. (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.30.) Several statutory bases for
expungement of a lis pendens exist, including (1) the pleadings on which the
lis pendens is based do not contain a “real property claim” (id., §
405.31), and (2) the claimant has not established by a preponderance of the
evidence the probable validity of the real property claim (id., §
405.32). The claimant bears the burden of proof on the motion. (Id., §
405.30.)
“The court shall direct that the party
prevailing on any motion under this chapter be awarded the reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs of making or opposing the motion unless the court
finds that the other party acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of attorney’s fees and costs unjust.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 405.38.)
DISCUSSION
I.
Expungement 
Plaintiff’s claims, except promissory
estoppel,[1]
affect title to or possession of real property because they concern ownership
of the subject property. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant has an obligation to
sell the property to Plaintiff. Thus, Plaintiff’s claims are real property
claims. However, merely stating a real property claim is insufficient to
maintain a lis pendens. A lis pendens must be expunged if the plaintiff cannot
prove the probable validity of his or her claim by a preponderance of the
evidence. (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.32.) On a motion to expunge, the plaintiff
bears the burden of proof. (Id., § 405.30.) 
            Defendant has established through
Plaintiff’s own deposition testimony that Plaintiff did not satisfy her
obligations in the sale agreement prior to the close of escrow. (See Compl.,
Ex. A.) Plaintiff did not obtain a loan nor provide a down payment. (Gomez
Decl., Ex. G at 99:13-15, 100:5-101:10.) Plaintiff also failed to tender a
promissory note secured by a deed of trust. (Id. at 117:9-22.) This
establishes as a matter of law that Plaintiff’s claims have no probability of
success. (See Brown v. Grimes (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 265, 277 [“When a
party’s failure to perform a contractual obligation constitutes a material
breach of the contract, the other party may be discharged from its duty to
perform under the contract”].)   
Plaintiff cites no evidence to rebut
Defendant’s showing.[2]
There is no evidentiary support for Plaintiff’s claim that the lender required
certain repairs to the property before releasing the loan funds. (See Opp.
4:1-6.) There is also no support for Plaintiff’s contention that Defendant made
Plaintiff’s performance impossible by cancelling the escrow. (See Opp.
5:17-19.) The evidence shows that Defendant was entitled to cancel the escrow
because Plaintiff failed to perform her obligations under the agreement. (See Brown,
supra, 192 Cal.App.4th at p. 277.)  
In sum, while Plaintiff has alleged real
property claims, she has failed to establish the probable validity of those
claims by a preponderance of the evidence. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 405.30,
405.32.) Therefore, the motion to expunge must be granted.  
II.
Undertaking
            Plaintiff argues that if the motion
is granted, it must be conditioned upon Defendant posting an undertaking.
However, an undertaking is only required as a condition of expungement “if the
court finds that the real property claim has probable validity, but adequate
relief can be secured to the claimant by the giving of an undertaking.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 405.33.) “The court shall not order an undertaking to be given as
a condition of expunging the notice if the court finds the claimant has not
established the probable validity of the real property claim.” (Id., §
405.32.) As discussed above, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not established
the probable validity of her real property claim. Thus, an undertaking is not
required.  
 
III.
Attorney’s Fees
            Attorney’s fees are warranted under
Code of Civil Procedure section 405.38. 
Defendant claims total costs of $6,810
associated with the motion based on work by various attorneys, paralegals, and
administrative personnel. (See Gomez Decl. ¶¶ 13-25.) The Court finds this to
be excessive given the simplicity of the motion. The Court awards $3,150 based
on 7 hours at a rate of $450.   
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s motion to expunge lis
pendens is GRANTED. The Court awards Defendant attorney’s fees in the amount of
$3,150.
