And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment and granted the plaintiff's opposition to the motion. The plaintiff brought a lawsuit against the defendant, alleging employment discrimination, retaliation, and failure to prevent discrimination. The defendant argued that the plaintiff did not have a prima facie case of discrimination and that the plaintiff's poor performance was the reason for the adverse employment actions taken against the plaintiff. The judge found that the plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to support a reasonable inference that the defendant discriminated against the plaintiff based on her race. The judge also found that the defendant's actions were pretextual and that the plaintiff suffered adverse employment actions after reporting her complaints. The judge denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment and granted the plaintiff's opposition to the motion.
