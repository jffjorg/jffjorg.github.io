And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a case involving a promotion that Plaintiff allegedly failed to receive due to discriminatory motives. The Defendant contends that Plaintiff was passed over because she failed to answer a call, but Plaintiff denies being contacted at all or receiving a voicemail. The judge is considering "me too" evidence presented by Ms. Santos, which is admissible to show discriminatory motive. The judge finds that this evidence is relevant and will be considered at the upcoming hearing, as it is fact-based and related to the Plaintiff's circumstances and theory of the case. The judge also notes that any dissimilarities between the facts presented in Ms. Santos' declaration and the Plaintiff's own case will affect the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. The judge is leaving open the question of whether Plaintiff was indeed contacted and will allow a triable issue to be decided at the upcoming hearing.
