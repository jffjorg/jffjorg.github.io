            v.
 
COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES, 
                        Defendant.
  


 
  Case No.:  22STCV26562
  Hearing Date:  June 28, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant’s motion for summary judgment
  or adjudication 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On August 16, 2022, Plaintiff
Dominique Louissaint filed this employment discrimination action against
Defendant County of Los Angeles. Plaintiff, an African-American nurse in the
Department of Health Services, alleges that she has been routinely denied promotion
on the basis of her race. Plaintiff additionally alleges that she has been
subjected to retaliation for reporting unlawful hiring practices. The complaint
asserts causes of action for (1) discrimination, (2) failure to accommodate,
(3) failure to engage in the interactive process, (4) retaliation, and (5)
failure to prevent. 
            On December 29, 2023, Defendant
filed the instant motion for summary judgment or adjudication in the
alternative. Plaintiff filed her opposition on June 14, 2024. Defendant filed
its reply on June 21, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
The function of a motion for summary
judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing
party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an
order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure section
437c, subdivision (c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if
all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the
evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there
is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp.
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion
for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the
affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of
fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of
Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v.
Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-382.)
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial
burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to
establish a defense. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); Scalf v. D. B.
Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has
met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable
issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a
defense thereto. To establish a triable issue of material fact, the party
opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster
v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.) Courts “liberally construe the
evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts
concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide,
Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)

DISCUSSION
I.
Disability-Based Claims
            “The timely filing of an
administrative complaint is a prerequisite to the bringing of a civil action
for damages under the FEHA.” (Morgan v. Regents of University of California
(2000) 88 Cal.App.4th 52, 63.) While claims not listed in an administrative
complaint may be included in a subsequent civil action if the claims are
sufficiently similar, discrimination based on one protected characteristic is
distinct from discrimination based on another protected characteristic. (Okoli
v. Lockheed Technical Operations Co. (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1607, 1614-15.)
            Plaintiff filed a Department of Fair
Employment and Housing (DFEH) complaint on January 12, 2021 that charged
discrimination based on race, not disability. (Def.’s Undisputed Facts (UF) 1-6.)
Plaintiff concedes that her DFEH complaint does not allege disability
discrimination, and Plaintiff does not dispute that she failed to exhaust her
administrative remedies as to her claims for failure to accommodate and failure
to engage. (Opp. 1:3-5.) Therefore, the second and third causes of action fail
as a matter of law. 
II.
Statute of Limitations
Effective January 1, 2020, Assembly Bill 9
extended the statute of limitations for a FEHA claim from one to three years.
(See Gov. Code, § 12960(e)(5).) However, the expanded limitations period does
not apply retroactively to claims that have already lapsed. (Id., §
12960(f)(3); Quarry v. Doe I (2012) 53 Cal.4th 945, 957.) 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s denied
promotions in 2006, 2008, and 2016 are not actionable because they are
time-barred. Plaintiff does not contest this point. Therefore, the actions in
2006, 2008, and 2016 are not actionable as a matter of law. 
III.
Discrimination
a. Legal Standard
Government Code section 12940, subdivision
(a) prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee based on a
protected characteristic. In order to establish a claim of discrimination,
Plaintiffs must prove: (1) they are in a protected class; (2) an adverse
employment action was taken against them; (3) at the time of the adverse action
they were satisfactorily performing their jobs; and (4) some other circumstance
suggesting discriminatory motive. (Guz v. Bechtel (2000) 24 Cal. 4th
317, 355.) 
Under the McDonnell-Douglas
framework, (1) the plaintiff must initially establish a prima facie case of
discrimination, (2) the defendant must then articulate a legitimate
nonretaliatory explanation for its acts, and (3) in response, the plaintiff
must show that this explanation is pretextual. (Patten v. Grant Joint Union
High School Dist. (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1384.) Therefore, on summary
judgment, the defendant employer must either (1) undermine an element of the
plaintiff’s prima facie case or (2) provide a legitimate nonretaliatory reason
for the adverse employment action. (Cornell v. Berkeley Tennis Club
(2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 908, 926.) 
b. Discriminatory Motive
“Proof of discriminatory intent often
depends on inferences rather than direct evidence.” (Nazir v. United
Airlines, Inc. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 243, 283.) Therefore, “very little
evidence of such intent is necessary to defeat summary judgment.” (Ibid.)
“[S]ummary judgment should not be granted unless the evidence cannot support
any reasonable inference for plaintiff.” (Ibid.) 
Defendant denies that race is a factor in
considering promotions for Registered Nurse (RN) positions. (UF 18.) Defendant
points out that other African-American employees, such as Porsha Union-Brewster
and Josephine Ollawa, were promoted to RN II and Supervising Staff Nurse I,
respectively. (Ibid.) In December 2018, a black employee in the same
band[1] as
Plaintiff (Band 3) was promoted to RN II. (UF 34.) From the 2019 eligibility
list, three black employees who banded higher than Plaintiff were promoted to
RN II. (UF 38.) 
However, a plaintiff is not required to
prove that they were replaced by someone outside of their protected class as an
element of their prima facie case under the McDonnel-Douglas test. (Sandell
v. Taylor-Listug, Inc. (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 297, 321, fn. 12.) For
example, “even evidence that a member of a protected class was replaced by an
older individual would not conclusively disprove age discrimination.” (Id.
at p. 323, fn. 14.) “The fact that one person in the protected class has lost
out to another person in the protected class is thus irrelevant, so long as he
has lost out because of his [protected characteristic].” (O'Connor
v. Consol. Coin Caterers Corp. (1996) 517 U.S. 308, 312.) “[D]iscrimination
against one employee cannot be cured, or disproven, solely by favorable, or
equitable, treatment of other employees of the same race or sex.” (Brown v.
Henderson (2d Cir. 2001) 257 F.3d 246, 252.) An employer cannot be given “license
to discriminate against some employees on the basis of race or sex merely
because he favorably treats other members of the employees' group.” (Conn.
v. Teal (1982) 457 U.S. 440, 455.) 
Therefore, Defendant’s favorable treatment
of other members of Plaintiff’s protected class does not establish as a matter
of law that Defendant did not discriminate against Plaintiff. While Defendant’s
evidence may support an inference against discrimination, even a “strong
inference” against discrimination is insufficient to grant summary judgment
where a reasonable jury may draw a different inference. (Sandell, supra,
188 Cal.App.4th at p. 324.)   
Here, Plaintiff presents sufficient
evidence supporting a contrary inference. The majority of nurses at the Inmate
Reception Center (IRC) where Plaintiff worked were Filipino, including two of
Plaintiff’s supervisors, Guanzon and Arlyn Villegas. (Louissaint Decl. ¶ 43.) At
least one other employee has observed Filipino supervisors giving favorable
treatment to Filipino staff while disfavoring non-Filipino staff, particularly
African-Americans. (Santos Decl. ¶ 9.)[2] This
included preference for assignments, projects, overtime, recognition, and
awards. (Id., ¶ 10.) In 2023, IRC gave Employee of the Month awards
solely to Asian employees. (Id., ¶ 11.) Such awards are recorded in an
employee’s file and affect chances for promotion. (Ibid.) Ms. Santos has
observed that less qualified Asian nurses have been promoted over more
qualified black nurses. (Id., ¶ 12.)   
When Plaintiff applied for a promotion to
RN II in 2018, Guanzon invited 45 other nurses, a majority of whom were
Filipino, to apply as well. (Louissaint Decl. ¶ 8, Ex. D.) From the list of
eligible candidates, Plaintiff and Ms. Union-Brewster were contacted last for
interviews, whereas numerous Asian or Filipino candidates were contacted
earlier. (Def.’s Ex. 13; Plntf.’s Ex. BB, pp. 8-9.) After purportedly leaving a
voicemail[3]
for Plaintiff on October 26, 2018, Defendant moved on to the next band of
candidates without waiting five days for Plaintiff to respond, even though
Defendant’s protocol was to give a candidate five days to respond before
removing them from consideration. (Def.’s Ex. 12; Douglas Decl. ¶¶ 9-10.) 
Taken together and interpreted liberally
in Plaintiff’s favor, this evidence supports a reasonable inference that Defendant
refused to promote Plaintiff due to her race. (See Nazir, supra, 178
Cal.App.4th at p. 283 [requiring “very little evidence” of discriminatory
intent to survive summary judgment].) Therefore, there is a triable issue
regarding whether Defendant harbored the requisite discriminatory animus.    
c. Adverse Employment Action
An adverse employment action is any
“course or pattern of conduct that, taken as a whole, materially and adversely
affected the terms, and conditions of a plaintiff’s employment.” (Holmes v.
Petrovich Development Co., LLC (2011) 191 Cal.App.4th 1047, 1063.)
Defendant argues that the counseling memos were not discipline and therefore do
not constitute adverse employment actions. 
First, the discrimination claim is also
based on the failure to promote Plaintiff, which is indisputably an adverse
employment action. As discussed above, a reasonable jury may find that
Defendant denied Plaintiff’s promotions based on her race. Thus, the
discrimination claim is triable even if the counseling memos were not adverse
employment actions.
Second, a reasonable trier of fact may
conclude that the counseling memos were part of a “course or pattern” of
discriminatory conduct which “materially and adversely” affected Plaintiff’s
employment. (See Holmes, supra, 191 Cal.App.4th at p. 1063.) Defendant
cites no evidence or authority precluding this inference as a matter of law. 
Thus, Defendant has failed to meet its
initial burden of demonstrating that Plaintiff did not suffer an adverse
employment action. 
d. Legitimate Reason
“Generally in cases involving affirmative
adverse employment actions, pretext may be demonstrated by showing the
proffered reason had no basis in fact, the proffered reason did not actually
motivate the discharge, or, the proffered reason was insufficient to motivate
discharge.” (Soria v. Univision Radio Los Angeles, Inc. (2016) 5
Cal.App.5th 570, 594, internal citations omitted.) “[T]he same evidence can be
used both to set forth a prima facie case of discrimination, and to demonstrate
the existence of a triable issue of fact on the issue of pretext.” (DeJung
v. Superior Court (2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 533, 554.) “If triable issues of
material fact exist whether discrimination was a substantial motivating reason
for the employer's adverse employment action, even if the employer's professed
legitimate reason has not been disputed, the FEHA claim is not properly resolved
on summary judgment.” (Husman v. Toyota Motor Credit Corp. (2017) 12
Cal.App.5th 1168, 1186.) 
Defendant argues that its actions were
justified by Plaintiff’s poor performance. (UF 9-10, 12-15.) However, Plaintiff
disputes the basis for the counseling. (Louissaint Decl. ¶¶ 40-41, Ex. Z.)
Plaintiff has received a score of “Competent” or “Very Good” on her performance
evaluations, including notes that she “reported to work as scheduled and
maintained a standard attendance record.” (Plntf.’s Ex. DD.) Furthermore, the
concerns about Plaintiff’s purported deficiencies only materialized after
Plaintiff complained of discrimination. (Louissaint Decl. ¶ 42.) This, combined
with the evidence of racial animus discussed above, supports a reasonable
inference that Defendant’s proffered justification is pretextual. Therefore,
there are triable issues over Defendant’s legitimate justification. 
IV.
Retaliation
To establish a
prima facie case of FEHA retaliation, Plaintiff must show: (1) he engaged in a
“protected activity”; (2) the employer subjected him to an adverse employment
action; and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the
employer’s action. (Moore v. Regents of University of California (2016)
248 Cal.App.4th 216, 244.)   
            Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s
reporting could not have been the basis for the adverse employment actions
because the adverse actions predated Plaintiff’s reporting. Defendant argues
that “Plaintiff cannot demonstrate any adverse employment action after she
complained.” (Mtn. 17:14-15.) It is true that Plaintiff made protected
complaints due to the adverse employment actions against her. Thus, certain
adverse actions necessarily predate Plaintiff’s complaints. However, Defendant
has not presented evidence establishing as a matter of law that all
adverse employment actions predated Plaintiff’s complaints.  
For example, as discussed above, Defendant
began raising concerns about Plaintiff’s performance after Plaintiff’s
complaints, and such counseling may constitute an adverse employment action.
(See Plntf.’s Additional Facts (AF) 82-87 [detailing written and verbal
counselling that Plaintiff received after her protected activity].)
Furthermore, Guanzon sent an email to all staff about a supposed deficiency in
Plaintiff’s work instead of contacting Plaintiff privately. (Plntf.’s Ex. L.) Guanzon’s
claim that this was accidental does not preclude a triable issue. Therefore, a
reasonable jury may find that Plaintiff suffered adverse employment actions
after her protected activity as retaliation for complaining about
discrimination. 
V.
Failure to Prevent
FEHA requires an
employer to “take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and
harassment from occurring.” (Gov. Code, § 12940(k).) Defendant argues that this
claim fails because the underlying discrimination and retaliation claims fail.
However, those claims survive for the reasons discussed above. Therefore, the
failure to prevent claim survives as well. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s
motion for summary judgment is DENIED. Defendant’s alternative motion for
summary adjudication is GRANTED as to the second and third causes of action and
DENIED as to the remaining causes of action.
