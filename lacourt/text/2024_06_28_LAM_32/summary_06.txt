Summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The original complaint had errors, including alleging the wrong guaranty agreement, omitting a defendant from some allegations, and mistakenly corresponding the prayer for damages to the wrong causes of action. The plaintiff seeks to amend the complaint to correct these errors. The Judge finds that the plaintiff has met its burden in properly making the motion and that no defendants have filed an opposition claiming undue prejudice. The Judge grants the motion and orders the plaintiff to file the first amended complaint within 5 days.
