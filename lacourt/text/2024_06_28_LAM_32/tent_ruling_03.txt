[2] “Me too” evidence is admissible to
show discriminatory motive. (Pantoja v. Anton (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 87,
92.) “[T]he relevance of the evidence ‘is fact based and depends on many
factors, including how closely related the evidence is to the plaintiff's
circumstances and theory of the case.’” (Johnson v. United Cerebral
Palsy/Spastic Children's Foundation (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 740, 767.) “Dissimilarities
between the facts related in the other employees' declarations and the facts
asserted by plaintiff with regard to her own case go to the weight of the
evidence, not its admissibility.” (Ibid.) Ms. Santos’ declaration
describes events sufficiently related to Plaintiff’s circumstances and theory
of the case. 
 


[3] Plaintiff denies being contacted
at all or receiving a voicemail (Louissaint Decl. ¶ 10), thus raising a triable
issue to the extent Defendant contends that Plaintiff was passed over for
promotion because she failed to answer the call.
