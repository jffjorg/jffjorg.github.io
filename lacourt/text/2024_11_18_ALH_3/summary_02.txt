And here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to seal court records filed by Jane Doe, the plaintiff in this case. The motion seeks to seal portions of the Declaration of Devon E. Porter, which was filed in support of the defendants' motion to compel arbitration. The plaintiff alleges that she was sexually abused over the course of two years and filed the lawsuit under a pseudonym to protect her privacy. She argues that her privacy interest would be threatened if her name is disclosed because of the extremely private, sensitive, and shocking allegations contained in the complaint.

The Court finds that the plaintiff possesses an overriding privacy interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record and will be prejudiced absent sealing. The proposed redaction of the plaintiff's name is narrowly tailored and there are no less restrictive means to protect her anonymity.

Accordingly, the Court grants the plaintiff's motion to seal and orders the Clerk to file the unredacted lodged copy of the Porter Declaration under seal.
