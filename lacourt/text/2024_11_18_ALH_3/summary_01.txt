And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to compel further responses to the plaintiff's Form Interrogatories. The motion concerns Form Interrogatories - General (Set One) and requests that the plaintiff provide further responses without objections. The judge has granted the motion in part, ordering the plaintiff to provide further responses to certain Form Interrogatories that do not seek information contained within the plaintiff's personnel file. The judge has also denied the motion as to certain Form Interrogatories that seek information contained within the plaintiff's personnel file, citing the Pitchess statutes. Additionally, the judge has denied the motion as to Form Interrogatories Nos. 50.1-50.6, which seek information related to causes of action based on breach of contract. Finally, the judge has denied sanctions to both parties, finding that they acted with substantial justification in making and opposing the motion.
