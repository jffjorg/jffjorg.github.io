And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the demurrer filed by the Defendant to the Second Amended Complaint and has sustained it without leave to amend. The Court has also considered the motion for leave to file a Third Amended Complaint filed by the Plaintiff and has denied it.

The Court has found that the Plaintiff has failed to state a due process claim under either state or federal law, as the daily cap on cryptocurrency kiosk transactions is reasonably related to the legitimate purpose of limiting the impact of fraudulent transactions. The Court has also found that the Plaintiff has failed to state an equal protection claim under either state or federal law, as the daily cap does not infringe on a fundamental right and is rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose.

The Court has further found that the Plaintiff has failed to state a takings claim under either state or federal law, as the daily cap does not constitute a taking without just compensation. The Court has also found that the Plaintiff's motion for leave to file a Third Amended Complaint is futile, as the proposed amendment would not cure the defects in the pleading.

Accordingly, the Court has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and has denied the motion for leave to file a Third Amended Complaint.
