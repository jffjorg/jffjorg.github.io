And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Defendant's motion to strike punitive damages from the complaint. The Plaintiffs, Alba Nidia Villareal, et al., filed this action against the Defendant, Walnut Creek, LLC, alleging habitability issues and defective conditions in the subject premises. The Defendant has failed to correct the deficiencies despite notice from the Plaintiffs and the health department, and has instead retaliated against the Plaintiffs by entering their units for extended periods without making any repairs. The Judge finds that the allegations demonstrate conscious disregard for the Plaintiffs' rights and safety and conduct imposing unjust hardship, and therefore concludes that the complaint adequately pleads a basis for punitive damages. The Judge denies the Defendant's motion to strike.
