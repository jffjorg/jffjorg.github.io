  Case Number:  23STCP04679    Hearing Date:   August 9, 2024    Dept:  32      ALLIANCE FOR THE FAIR ACCESS TO    CRYPTOCURRENCY TERMINALS,                                                  Plaintiff,             v.   THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,    et al.,                          Defendants.           Case No.:  23STCP04679   Hearing Date:  August 9, 2024        [TENTATIVE]    order RE: defendant’s demurrer to second amended    complaint               BACKGROUND             On December 29, 2023, Plaintiff  Alliance for the Fair Access to Cryptocurrency Terminals filed this action for  declaratory and injunctive relief. Plaintiff filed the operative Second Amended  Complaint on May 24, 2024, naming as Defendant the California Department of  Financial Protection and Innovation. The State of California was dismissed per  agreement of the parties.               Through this action, Plaintiff  challenges Financial Code section 3902, which states that “[a]n operator shall  not accept or dispense more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) in a day from or  to a customer via a digital financial asset transaction kiosk.” Plaintiff  alleges that the daily cap harms cryptocurrency kiosk operators and associated  businesses without a corresponding benefit to consumer protection. Plaintiff  alleges that the Legislature enacted Section 3902 based on speculation and  animus. Plaintiff contends that Section 3902 is arbitrary and capricious in  violation of the California Constitution.              On June 27, 2024, Defendant filed  the instant demurrer against the SAC. Plaintiff filed its opposition on July  25, 2024. Defendant filed its reply on August 2, 2024. LEGAL STANDARD A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether a  pleading states a cause of action or defense. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When  considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in  context. (Taylor v. City of Los  Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)  In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the  pleading or by proper judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd.  (a).) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other  extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior  Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the  defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a  demurrer hearing is whether the pleading, as it stands, unconnected with  extraneous matters, states a cause of action or defense. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.) JUDICIAL NOTICE             Defendant’s request for judicial  notice is granted as to the existence and contents of legislative history, but  not for the truth of the factual findings therein. (See Evid. Code, § 452(c); Syngenta  Crop. Prot., Inc. v. Helliker (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1135, 1163; Steed v.  Department of Consumer Affairs (2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 112, 120-21.)  MEET AND CONFER Before filing a demurrer or a motion to  strike, the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the  party who filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the  motion to strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be  reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the  objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.)  The Court notes that Defendants have complied with the meet and confer  requirement. (See Barsegyan Decl.) DISCUSSION I.  Declaratory Relief “Any person interested under a written  instrument . . . or under a contract . . . may, in cases of actual controversy  relating to the legal rights and duties of the respective parties, bring an  original action or cross-complaint in the superior court for a declaration of  his or her rights and duties . . . arising under the instrument or contract.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1060.) A complaint for declaratory relief need only state “facts  establishing the existence of an actual controversy.” (Ludgate Ins. Co. v.  Lockheed Martin Corp. (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 592, 606.) “[T]o be entitled to  declaratory relief, a party need not establish that it is also entitled to a  favorable judgment.” (Ibid.) However, “[a] general demurrer to a  declaratory relief cause of action is proper when the plaintiff does not allege  facts sufficient to state the derivative claim.” (Allen v. City of  Sacramento (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 41, 54.)  Here, Plaintiff seeks declaratory relief  that Financial Code section 3902 violates state and federal due process and  equal protection, and that it violates the takings clauses under the state and  federal constitutions. Therefore, the issue is whether Plaintiff has alleged  sufficient facts supporting these underlying claims. (See Allen, supra, 234  Cal.App.4th at p. 54.) II.  Due Process             a. California In California, “substantive due process .  . . prevents government from enacting legislation that is ‘arbitrary’ or ‘discriminatory’  or lacks ‘a reasonable relation to a proper legislative purpose.’” (Kavanau  v. Santa Monica Rent Control Bd. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 761, 771.) An enactment  pursuant to the state’s police powers will be upheld if “it is reasonably  related to promoting the public health, safety, comfort, and welfare, and if  the means adopted to accomplish that promotion are reasonably appropriate to the  purpose.” (Sunset Amusement Co. v. Board of Police Comm'rs (1972) 7  Cal.3d 64, 72.)  Where “the necessity or propriety of an  enactment [is] a question upon which reasonable minds might differ, the  propriety and necessity of such enactment [is] a matter of legislative  determination.” (Consolidated Rock Products Co. v. Los Angeles (1962) 57  Cal.2d 515, 522.) Courts do not pass on the “wisdom and propriety of a  particular enactment as a means of accomplishing a particular end . . . as long  as there are considerations of public health, safety, morals, or general  welfare which the legislative body may have had in mind, which have justified  the regulation.” (Ibid.)   b. Federal               “The Fourteenth Amendment to the  United States Constitution provides in relevant part that ‘[no] state [shall]  deprive any person of . . . property, without due process of law . . . .’” (20th  Century Ins. Co. v. Garamendi (1994) 8 Cal.4th 216, 291.) An enactment is  unconstitutional if it is “arbitrary, discriminatory, or demonstrably  irrelevant to the policy the legislature is free to adopt.” (Ibid.) “[C]ourts  have upheld challenged governmental acts unless no reasonably conceivable set  of facts could establish a rational relationship between the regulation and the  government's legitimate ends.” (Id. at p. 292.)  “[T]he law need not be in every respect  logically consistent with its aims to be constitutional. It is enough that  there is an evil at hand for correction, and that it might be thought that the  particular legislative measure was a rational way to correct it.” (Williamson  v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc. (1955) 348 U.S. 483, 487-88.) Courts do  not use the due process clause to strike down laws that are merely “unwise,  improvident, or out of harmony with a particular school of thought.” (Id.  at p. 488.)  c. Application Here, it is undisputed that limiting the  damage caused by fraudulent transactions is a legitimate legislative purpose  and that imposing a daily transaction limit is a reasonable means of achieving  this purpose. In fact, Plaintiff’s “members were generally supportive of the  2023 legislation,” although “they suggested modifying the transaction cap to  $5,000 per terminal per day.” (SAC ¶ 28.) The SAC also references an FBI report  that acknowledged “a spike in crypto investment schemes,” although the report  noted that crypto kiosks are “not the exclusive or even primary means through  which crypto-related frauds and scams are conducted.” (Id., ¶ 30.) These facts, combined with the existence  and contents of the legislative history of SB 401 (Def.’s RJN, Ex. B-J),  establish as a matter of law that the cap on daily kiosk transactions is  reasonably related to the legitimate purpose of limiting fraudulent  transactions. Plaintiff’s disagreement as to the amount of the cap ($1,000 or  $5,000) implicates “a question upon which reasonable minds might differ,” and  it is not for the Court to pass judgment on the “wisdom and propriety of [the]  particular enactment” of the $1,000 cap. (See Consolidated Rock Products Co.,  supra, 57 Cal.2d at p. 522.) Ultimately, the facts show that “there [were]  considerations of public health, safety, morals, or general welfare which the  legislative body . . . had in mind, which have justified the regulation.” (Ibid.)     Plaintiff alleges that the cap was imposed  “solely to prevent the kiosk operators from using their property to make a  profit so that they leave the state.” (SAC ¶ 27.) Plaintiff alleges that the $1,000  cap on kiosks does not actually limit damages because the cap simply drives  consumers to utilize alternative transaction sources that have no limits and  are more susceptible to fraud. (Id., ¶¶ 24-26.)  However, “[t]he proper inquiry is not into  the subjective motive of the government agency, but whether there is,  objectively, sufficient connection between the . . . regulation in question and  a legitimate governmental purpose so that the former may be said to  substantially advance the latter.” (Breneric Associates v. City of Del Mar  (1998) 69 Cal.App.4th 166, 184-85.) Even if individual lawmakers may have  harbored animus towards crypto operators, that does not alter the fact that  imposing a transaction limit rationally advances the legitimate purpose of  reducing damages from fraudulent transactions.  Furthermore, for a law to be rationally  related to a legitimate purpose, “the law need not be in every respect  logically consistent” with that purpose. (Williamson, supra, 348 U.S. at  pp. 487-88.) A law is not unconstitutional merely because it is “unwise,  improvident, or out of harmony.” (Id. at p. 488.) Thus, the fact that  the $1,000 cap may not fulfill its purpose of limiting fraudulent transactions  in every instance does not negate its rational relation to that purpose.  In sum, Plaintiff has failed to state a  due process claim under either state or federal law. III.  Equal Protection             a. Federal             “In resolving equal protection  issues, the United States Supreme Court has used three levels of analysis.  Distinctions in statutes that involve suspect classifications or touch upon  fundamental interests are subject to strict scrutiny, and can be sustained only  if they are necessary to achieve a compelling state interest. Classifications  based on gender are subject to an intermediate level of review. But most  legislation is tested only to determine if the challenged classification bears  a rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose.” (Walgreen Co. v.  City and County of San Francisco (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 424, 435.)              Rational basis is the “conventional  standard for reviewing economic and social welfare legislation in which there  is a ‘discrimination’ or differentiation of treatment between classes or  individuals. It manifests restraint by the judiciary in relation to the  discretionary act of a co-equal branch of government; in so doing it invests  legislation involving such differentiated treatment with a presumption of  constitutionality and ‘requir[es] merely that distinctions drawn by a  challenged statute bear some rational relationship to a conceivable legitimate  state purpose.’” (Warden v. State Bar (1999) 21 Cal.4th 628, 641.) “[A]  legislative choice is not subject to courtroom factfinding and may be based on  rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data.” (Fcc v.  Beach Communications (1993) 508 U.S. 307, 315.)    b. California “California follows the federal approach  to evaluating whether a legislative classification transgresses the equal  protection clause.” (California Gillnetters Assn. v. Department of Fish  & Game (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1145, 1152.) Namely, strict scrutiny is  applied “[w]hen a law impinges on certain fundamental rights.” (Id. at  p. 1153.) “For most legislation, however, a court will apply the rational basis  test,” which analyzes “whether the classification is ‘rationally related to a  legitimate governmental purpose.’” (Ibid.) “A distinction within a  legislative scheme is not arbitrary if any set of facts would support it.” (Rupf  v. Yan (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 411, 421.)     c. Application It is undisputed that section 3902 does  not infringe on a fundamental right and is thus subject to the rational basis  test. Plaintiff’s equal protection claim alleges that section 3902 singles out  crypto kiosk operators by imposing the $1,000 transaction limit only on those  operators and no one else. (SAC ¶ 61.) Plaintiff alleges that there is no  rational basis for this disparate treatment. (Ibid.)  However, as discussed above, the alleged  and judicially noticeable facts establish that the $1,000 cap is rationally  related to the legitimate purpose of limiting the impact of fraudulent  transactions. As with due process, it is not for the Court to pass judgment on  the wisdom of the particular cap ultimately imposed by the Legislature. Rational  basis reflects “restraint by the judiciary in relation to the discretionary act  of a co-equal branch of government” and affords disparate laws “a presumption  of constitutionality.” (Warden, supra, 21 Cal.4th at p. 641.) The  allegations in the complaint, even if true, fail to rebut this presumption or  raise an inference that the challenged law cannot be supported by “any  set of facts.” (See Rupf, supra, 85 Cal.App.4th at p. 421.)  Therefore, the SAC fails to state an equal  protection claim under either state or federal law. IV.  Takings Clause             “The Fifth Amendment to the United  States Constitution states that ‘private property [shall not] be taken for  public use without just compensation.’ Article I, section 19 of the California  Constitution contains similar language, stating that governmental entities must  pay just compensation when they ‘take’ private property for public use.” (Home  Builders Ass'n v. City of Napa (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 188, 195.) “[T]he  takings clause in the California Constitution is construed congruently with the  federal clause.” (Lockaway Storage v. County of Alameda (2013) 216 Cal.  App. 4th 161, 183.)              “The paradigmatic taking requiring  just compensation is a direct government appropriation or physical invasion of  private property—a categorical taking.” (Shaw v. County of Santa Cruz  (2008) 170 Cal.App.4th 229, 260.) However, “where the government action does  not result in any physical invasion of the property, the action will still be  considered a taking if the regulation deprives the owner of ‘all economically  beneficial or productive use of [the] land.’” (Ibid.) “Regulatory  takings challenges outside these two categories, i.e., those that do not  involve a physical invasion or that leave the property owner with some  economically beneficial use of the property, are governed by the ‘essentially  ad hoc, factual inquiries’ set forth in Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York  City (1978) 438 U.S. 104, 124.” (Id. at p. 261.)              There is no “set formula” for what  constitutes a taking. (Penn Central, supra, 438 U.S. at p. 124.)  However, several factors have “particular significance.” (Ibid.) These  are: (i) the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant; (ii) the extent  to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed  expectations; and (iii) the character of the governmental action. (Ibid.)  “The takings protection focuses on the impact of the government's action:  whether the government has in effect appropriated private property for its own  use, rather than merely regulating a private use of the property.” (Shaw,  supra, 170 Cal.App.4th at p. 265.)              A court “may dispose of a takings  claim on the basis of one or two of these factors.” (Allegretti & Co. v.  County of Imperial (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1261, 1277.) For example, “where  the nature of the governmental action and the economic impact of the regulation  did not establish a taking, the court need not consider investment-backed  expectations.” (Ibid., citing Bronco Wine v. Jolly (2005) 129  Cal.App.4th 988, 1035.) Or, a court may “dispos[e] of [a] takings claim  relating to trade secrets solely on [the] absence of reasonable  investment-backed expectations.” (Ibid., citing Ruckelshaus v.  Monsanto Co. (1984) 467 U.S. 986, 1005.)             Here, the nature of the governmental  action shows as a matter of law that it is not a taking. Limiting the daily  transaction limit for crypto kiosks constitutes “regulating a private use of  the property,” but the government has not “appropriated private property for  its own use.” (See Shaw, supra, 170 Cal.App.4th at p. 265.) Neither the  SAC nor Plaintiff’s opposition brief explains how the government “takes” the  value of the cryptocurrency that kiosk operators cannot exchange due to the  daily cap. “[M]ere diminution in value of property, however serious, does not  constitute a taking.” (Allegretti, supra, 138 Cal.App.4th at p. 1278.)              Therefore, the SAC fails to state a  takings claim under either state or federal law.  CONCLUSION             Defendant’s demurrer to SAC is  SUSTAINED without leave to amend.   


 
ALLIANCE FOR THE FAIR ACCESS TO
  CRYPTOCURRENCY TERMINALS,
                        
                        Plaintiff,
            v.
 
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,
  et al., 
                        Defendants.



 
  Case No.:  23STCP04679
  Hearing Date:  August 9, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion for leave to file
  third amended complaint 




 


 




BACKGROUND

            On December 29, 2023, Plaintiff
Alliance for the Fair Access to Cryptocurrency Terminals filed this action for
declaratory and injunctive relief. Plaintiff filed the operative Second Amended
Complaint on May 24, 2024, naming as Defendant the California Department of
Financial Protection and Innovation. The State of California was dismissed per
agreement of the parties.  

            Through this action, Plaintiff
challenges Financial Code section 3902, which states that “[a]n operator shall
not accept or dispense more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) in a day from or
to a customer via a digital financial asset transaction kiosk.” Plaintiff
alleges that the daily cap harms cryptocurrency kiosk operators and associated
businesses without a corresponding benefit to consumer protection. Plaintiff
alleges that the Legislature enacted Section 3902 based on speculation and
animus. Plaintiff contends that Section 3902 is arbitrary and capricious in
violation of the California Constitution. 

            On June 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion for leave to file a Third Amended Complaint. Defendant filed
its opposition on July 29, 2024. Plaintiff filed its reply on July 30, 2024. 

LEGAL STANDARD

The court may, in furtherance of justice,
and on such terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading. (Code
Civ. Proc, §§ 473, subd. (a), 576.) Courts must apply a policy of liberality in
permitting amendments at any stage of the proceeding, including during trial,
when no prejudice to the opposing party is shown. (Duchrow v. Forrest
(2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1377.) In determining the extent of prejudice to
the opposing party, the court must consider various factors, such as whether
the amendment would delay trial or increase the discovery burden. (Demetriades
v. Yelp, Inc. (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 294, 306.)

A motion for leave to amend a complaint
must be accompanied by a declaration that explains: (1) the effect of the
amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts
giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the reasons why
the request for amendment was not made earlier. (Cal. Rules of Ct., Rule
3.1324(b).)

DISCUSSION

            Plaintiff seeks to file the TAC to
account for additional facts obtained in discovery purportedly showing that
Defendant acted arbitrarily in enacting the daily cap. However, a court is not required
to grant leave to amend where the proposed amendment would be futile. (See
Foroudi
v. The Aerospace Corp. (2020) 57 Cal.App.5th 992, 1000.) 

As discussed in the Court’s concurrent
ruling on Defendant’s demurrer to the SAC, Plaintiff cannot state the
underlying due process, equal protection, and takings claims as a matter of
law. Plaintiff has not articulated how those claims could be cured by
amendment. The recent deposition testimony and related additional allegations
in the proposed TAC do not remedy the defects. 
 

 

CONCLUSION

            Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file
Third Amended Complaint is DENIED.
