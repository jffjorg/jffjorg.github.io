MOTION
Plaintiff Cypress Escrow
and Settlement Services, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) moves for discharge from this action.  Defendants Avra Properties Beverly Hills 1
LLC and Sasha Matloob (“Defendants”) stipulate to this relief.
ANALYSIS
A stakeholder claiming
no interest in funds held may apply to the court for permission to deposit the
money or property with the court clerk and for an order discharging the
stakeholder from further liability to the adverse claimants.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 386.5.)  
In the instant
case, Plaintiff held $50,000 in escrow in connection with a real property
sale.  After a dispute arose between the
parties to the real property sale as to the disposition of the funds, Plaintiff
filed this complaint in interpleader.  Pursuant
to this Court’s August 20, 2024 order, Plaintiff deposited the funds with the
Court.  Under these circumstances, Plaintiff’s
discharge from this action is warranted.  (Pacific Loan Management Corp. v. Superior
Court (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1485, 1489-1490.) 
A stakeholder may
seek reimbursement for costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred, and the
court may order payment thereof out of the funds deposited by the
stakeholder.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 386.6.)  The attorney fees award is
limited to “costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred in [the interpleader]
action.” (Ibid.)  Plaintiff seeks
attorney fees in the amount of $8,562.  Plaintiff
relies on the declaration of its attorney, Courtney L. Puritsky (“Counsel”).  Counsel states he has incurred attorney fees
and costs in the amount of $8,562 in litigating this action.  (Declaration of Courtney L. Puritsky, ¶ 6.)  Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request for attorney fees and costs.
Plaintiff is ordered
to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
