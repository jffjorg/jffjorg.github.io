  - "To establish a cause of action for breach of contract, the plaintiff must plead and prove (1) the existence of the contract, (2) the plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the defendant's breach, and (4) resulting damages to the plaintiff."
  - "The elements of a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation are: (1) the defendant must have made a representation as to a past or existing material fact; (2) the representation must have been untrue; (3) regardless of the defendant’s actual belief, the defendant must have made the representation without any reasonable ground for believing it to be true; (4) the representation must have been made with the intent to induce the plaintiff to rely on it; (5) the plaintiff must have been unaware of the falsity of the representation and must have acted in justifiable reliance on the truth of the representation; and (6) as a result of reliance on the truth of the representation, the plaintiff must have sustained damage."
