And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses various issues related to a plaintiff's claims for breach of contract and damages against a defendant. The judge rejects the defendant's arguments to strike the plaintiff's exhibits and notes that the March 2019 employment contract is broken into several blocks, including an unsigned October 4, 2021 Independent Contractor Agreement and Fee Agreement. The judge also rejects the defendant's Statute of Frauds argument, finding that the contracts were not completed within one year and that the defendant terminated the plaintiff's employment multiple times within a one-year period.

The judge also addresses the defendant's arguments regarding punitive damages, finding that the court will not strike all paragraphs related to punitive damages, but will strike the prayer for punitive damages as it applies to one defendant. Additionally, the judge notes that the plaintiff's request for $100,000 in compensatory damages is not uncertain and does not render the damages uncertain.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is a preliminary assessment of the issues in the case and may be subject to change based on further argument and evidence presented at a future hearing.
