On August 1, 2024, plaintiff Michelle
Wu (“Plaintiff”) filed this motion for an order compelling defendant American
Southwest Chamber of Commerce (“Defendant”) to serve further responses to her
Requests for Production of Documents (Set One), Nos. 2 through 5, 14, 16, 19,
20, 22 through 24, 27, 28, and 30 through 32. The motion is unopposed, but it
does not appear that the Court has jurisdiction to rule on this motion. 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.310(c) states: “Unless notice of this motion is given within 45 days of
the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or
on or before any specific later date to which the demanding party and the
responding party have agreed in writing, the demanding party waives any right
to compel a further response to the demand.”
Here, based on Plaintiff’s counsel’s
declaration, the correspondence between counsel, and Plaintiff’s separate
statement, it appears that Defendant served initial responses on January 5,
2024, and that the parties met and conferred to extend the deadline to file a
motion to compel further to February 19, 2023. When Defendant retained new
counsel, the parties further met and conferred (and attended an IDC). Based on
the separate statement, Defendant served supplemental responses on April 4,
2024 (Plaintiff did not include a copy of these responses with her motion). The
motion was filed and served on August 1, 2024, which is more than 45 days after
the supplemental responses were served on April 4, 2024. Therefore, Plaintiff
has waived her right to compel a further response from Defendant and the motion
is DENIED.

this 6th
day of November, 2024
