And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The plaintiff, Liping Huang, filed an unlawful detainer action against the defendant, Yihang Duan, and claimed to have personally served him on October 4, 2024. However, the defendant argued that he was detained at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) since February 28, 2024, and therefore could not have been personally served. The defendant attached documents, including a pretrial detention order and a printout from the Bureau of Prisons website, to support his claim. The plaintiff did not oppose the motion, and the judge found that the plaintiff failed to establish the facts required for effective service. Therefore, the judge granted the motion and ordered the service of summons to be quashed.
