And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by plaintiff Michelle Wu to compel defendant American Southwest Chamber of Commerce to serve further responses to her requests for production of documents. The motion is unopposed, but the court lacks jurisdiction to rule on it. According to the Code of Civil Procedure, a demanding party waives their right to compel further responses if they do not file a motion within 45 days of the service of the verified response or supplemental responses. In this case, the plaintiff filed the motion more than 45 days after the defendant served supplemental responses, so the motion is denied. The plaintiff has waived their right to compel further responses from the defendant.
