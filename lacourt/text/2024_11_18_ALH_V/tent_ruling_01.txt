On October 12, 2023, defendant extended the deadline to October 31, 2024. (Decl. of Andrew S. Wellman, ¶ 5.) The parties were optimistic about a resolution when plaintiff’s counsel stopped communicating with defendant’s counsel; defendant’s counsel emailed and/or called plaintiff’s counsel on November 10, November 21, December 6, and January 10, 2024. (Decl. of Andrew S. Wellman, ¶ 6-7.) On February 5, 2024, defendant’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter regarding plaintiff’s missing responses to defendant’s written discovery. (Decl. of Andrew S. Wellman, ¶ 8; Exh. C.) On May 3, 2024, defendant’s counsel emailed plaintiff’s counsel stating that it was seeking court intervention in the form of the instant motion. (Decl. of Andrew S. Wellman, ¶ 11; Exh. D.)The court finds that defendant GEP properly served the written discovery on plaintiff and plaintiff has failed to provide verified responses. Accordingly, the court grants defendant GEP’s motion to compel responses to Form Interrogatories.Based on the foregoing, the court GRANTS defendant GEP’s motion to compel plaintiff to respond to Form Interrogatories – General, Set One.
