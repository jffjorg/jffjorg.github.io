And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the case is granted. The plaintiff's counsel mistakenly believed that the Order to Show Cause hearing was set for July 24, 2024, not June 24, 2024, which led to the failure to appear at the hearing and the subsequent dismissal of the case. The judge finds that the dismissal was caused by the mistake and grants the motion to vacate the dismissal. The case is to be reinstated on the civil active status list.
