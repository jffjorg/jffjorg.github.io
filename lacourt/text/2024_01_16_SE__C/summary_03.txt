The Plaintiff, Ricardo Zaragoza, filed a personal injury action against Lyft, Inc., et al. and Rogelio Cadungog, alleging that the defendants' negligence caused injuries and damages. The Plaintiff allegedly served the Defendant at 9336 Van Nuys Boulevard, Unit 41, Panorama City, CA 91402, but the Defendant claims that he did not reside or receive mail at that address at the time of service. The Defendant provided evidence, including a declaration from Guillermo Moreno Aragon, who confirmed that Rogelio Cadungog did not live at the address and did not receive mail there. The Court finds that the service of process was improper and grants the Defendant's motion to quash the service.
