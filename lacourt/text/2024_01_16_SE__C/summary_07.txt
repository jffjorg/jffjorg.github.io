And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion filed by plaintiffs Amy Suarez and Alyssa Cadena for an order nunc pro tunc correcting an e-filing error of the filing date of their summons and complaint. The plaintiffs' complaint was submitted for filing before the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, but was rejected by the court due to a technical error. The judge has deemed the summons and complaint filed as of July 28, 2023, when they were first presented to the court. The judge also reminds the parties to review the court's First Amended General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil and to comply with the "TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS" when e-filing documents, as failure to do so may result in rejection or other adverse consequences.
