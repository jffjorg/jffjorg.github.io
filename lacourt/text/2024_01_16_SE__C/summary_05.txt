And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Gustavo Mauricio Pacheco De Olazaval, has filed a demurrer to the plaintiff, Peter Gustavo Pacheco Cateriano's, first amended complaint. The demurrer argues that the plaintiff's claims fail to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. The court has analyzed the demurrer and found that the plaintiff has failed to comply with statutory requirements, specifically the Certificate of Merit and Corroborative Fact requirements. As a result, the court sustains the demurrer and gives the plaintiff 20 days to amend their complaint. Additionally, the court strikes the defendant's name from the complaint and replaces it with "Doe 1" until further order of the court.
