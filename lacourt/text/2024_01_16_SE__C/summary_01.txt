Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Plaintiff Jesse Simpson's motion to quash in part and denied it in part. The judge has determined that Plaintiff's attempt to limit the production of pre-October 2018 medical records is unreasonable and has granted the production of medical records from 2013 to the present. The judge has also denied Plaintiff's request to limit the production of mental health records from 2013 to the present, finding that the production of these records is appropriate given the breadth of Plaintiff's claimed emotional injuries. The judge has denied Plaintiff's request to quash records relating to prior acts of aggression by Plaintiff towards hospital staff/security, finding that this information could lead to admissible evidence. The judge has granted Plaintiff's request to quash records relating to drug use before October 24, 2018, but has denied it with respect to records relating to drug use on or after October 24, 2018.
