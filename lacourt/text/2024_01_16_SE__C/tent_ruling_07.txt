Plaintiffs
Amy Suarez and Alyssa Cadena’s Motion for an Order Nunc Pro Tunc Correcting an
E-Filing Error of the Filing Date of The Summons and Compliant is GRANTED. 
 
Background 
 
In
this personal injury action, Plaintiffs AMY SUAREZ, an individual, and ALYSSA
CADENA, a minor, by and through her Guardian ad Litem AMY SUAREZ (“Plaintiffs”)
allege that on July 28, 2021, Plaintiff Suarez was
driving her car northbound on I-605 near Telegraph Road when her vehicle
collided with a vehicle operated by Defendant RAFAEL CESPEDES REBOUCAS.
 
On
July 28, 2023, at 1:19 PM, Plaintiffs attempted to file their Complaint alleging
Negligence.
 
On
8/03/23, at 1:19 PM, the Court generated a Notice of Court Rejection of
Electronic Filing, citing the reason for the rejection as follows: “Reject Reason Other:
Select the word Minor under Subtype for minor party.”

(Ex.
2 to Mot.) 
 
On
8/22/23, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion for an order nunc pro tunc deeming
the Summons and Complaint filed on July 28, 2023..
 
No
opposition has been filed as of January 9, 2024. 
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Plaintiffs
argue that the Court clerk improperly rejected the filing after the two-year
statute of limitations expired. In Rojas v. Cutsforth (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 774, the plaintiff in a personal injury action had mailed the
complaint to the superior court clerk for filing within the statutory period;
however, the clerk returned the unfiled complaint by mail because the
declaration for court assignment was not signed and the summons contained the
address of the wrong branch of the court. In the meantime, the statute of
limitations passed. The trial court denied plaintiff's request for a nunc pro
tunc filing of the complaint and granted summary judgment for the defendant on
the ground that the plaintiff’s action was barred by the applicable statute of
limitations. The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment with instructions to
deem the complaint filed when it was first presented. The court held that the
clerk had no proper basis for rejecting plaintiffs’ complaint; thus, it was
deemed filed on the date that it was first deposited with the clerk. (See
also Dillon v. Superior Court of Nevada County (1914) 24 Cal.App. 760,
765–766 [a paper is deemed filed when deposited with the clerk with directions
to file the paper]; Carlson v. State of California Department of Fish &
Game (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 1268.) 
 
Here,
Plaintiffs’ complaint was submitted for filing before the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations and was rejected for reasons unrelated to any
legal deficiency in the complaint. Therefore, the Court grants the instant
motion, and orders Plaintiffs’ Summons and Complaint to be deemed filed as of July
28, 2023. 
 
Plaintiffs
are reminded to review the May 3, 2019 First Amended General Order Re Mandatory
Electronic Filing for Civil. When e-filing documents, parties must comply with
the “TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS” which are set forth at page 4, line 4 through page
5, line 12 of the Court’s 5/3/19 First Amended General Order Re Mandatory
Electronic Filing for Civil (particularly bookmarking declarations and
exhibits). (CRC 3.1110(f)(4).) Failure to comply with these requirements in the
future may result in papers being rejected, matters being placed off calendar,
matters being continued so documents can be resubmitted in compliance with
these requirements, documents not being considered and/or the imposition of
sanctions.
