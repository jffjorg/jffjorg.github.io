And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied without prejudice Counsel Omar Gastelum's motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Gia Development, LLC. The motion was denied because Counsel's Declaration failed to specify good cause in accordance with the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 3-700(C). The judge noted that the decision to grant or deny an attorney's motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, and that the court should consider whether the attorney's withdrawal would work an injustice in the handling of the case. Counsel may supplement his declaration at the hearing on the motion.
