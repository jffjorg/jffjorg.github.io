Tentative Ruling 
Defendant
Rogelio Cadungog’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons is GRANTED. 
Defendant
to give notice. 
 
Background

This personal injury action
arises from a motor vehicle accident that occurred on March 26, 2021, near the
intersection of S. Santa Fe Ave. and E. Slauson Ave. in Huntington Park.  
Plaintiff alleges that the acts
of defendants were negligent and that the acts were the legal (proximate) cause
of injuries and damages to Plaintiff. Plaintiff is asserting personal injuries
to his body and emotional state.
Plaintiff filed his complaint on
December 2, 2022. On September 3, 2023, Plaintiff alleged that Defendant
Cadungog was personally served at 9336 Van Nuys Boulevard, Unit 41, Panorama
City, CA 91402.
Defendant Caundgog filed this
Motion to Quash Service of Summons on December 12, 2023, alleging that he did
not reside, nor did he receive mail at the Panorama City address on September
3, 2023.
As of January 11, 2024, this motion is unopposed. 
 
Legal
Standard 
“A defendant, on or before the last
day of his or her time to plead or within any further time that the court may
for good cause allow, may serve and file a notice of motion” to “quash service
of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her,”
or to “dismiss the action on the ground of inconvenient forum.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a).) 
Here,
Plaintiff purports to have personally served Defendant at
9336 Van Nuys Boulevard, Unit 41, Panorama City, CA 91402. 
Defendant’s
Counsel has specially appeared to argue that Plaintiff’s service of process was
invalid. Defendant presents competent evidence that he does not currently
reside or receive mail at the Panorama City residential address at which the
process server delivered the summons and complaint.
Further,
Defendant has included the Declaration of Guillermo Moreno Aragon (“Aragon”) who
lives at the Panorama City address. In his Declaration, Aragon
states that on September 3, 2023, someone came to his door, called him Rogelio,
informed him that he had been served and dropped the service papers at his
doorstep. (Aragon Decl., ¶3). Aragon confirmed that at the time of service on
September 3, 2023, no one by the name of Rogelio Cadungog lived at his
residence nor received any mail at his address. (Aragon Decl., ¶¶ 4-5). Aragon
further confirmed that he did not know Defendant Cadungog and that Defendant Cadungog
does not live at 9336 Van Nuys Blvd., Unit 41, Panorama City, CA 91402, nor has
he ever lived with Aragon. (Aragon Decl., ¶¶ 6-7.) 
Since
Plaintiff did not serve Defendant at his “dwelling house,” “usual place of
abode,” or “usual mailing address,” and did not exercise reasonable diligence
to personally serve him, this service violated the Code of Civil Procedure.
Because service was improper, it must be quashed.
 
Accordingly, Defendant Cadungog’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons is
GRANTED.
