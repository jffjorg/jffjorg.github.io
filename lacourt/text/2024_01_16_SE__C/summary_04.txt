Here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by defendant DOE 1. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the plaintiff's Third Cause of Action for Negligent Hiring, Supervision, and Retention, and the Fourth Cause of Action for Negligent Supervision of a Minor. The judge has overruled the demurrer and found that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged the two causes of action.

The judge has also denied the motion to strike, finding that the allegations in the plaintiff's complaint are not deficient simply because they are made on information and belief. The judge has also found that DOE 1 had a special relationship with the plaintiff, giving rise to a duty to protect her from harm.

The ruling is based on the alleged facts in the plaintiff's complaint, which state that DOE 1 knew or should have known that DOE 3, its employee and agent, was a sexual predator and that he was involved in the sexual assault and molestation of the plaintiff. The judge has determined that these allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action for negligent hiring, supervision, and retention, as well as negligent supervision of a minor.
