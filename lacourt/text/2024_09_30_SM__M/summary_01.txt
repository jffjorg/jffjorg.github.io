And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling in favor of the plaintiff, Nancy One LLC, in an unlawful detainer action against defendants Brittany Littleton and Ricardo Arroyo. The plaintiff is seeking summary judgment for possession of the Premises, which is located at 17050 W. Sunset Blvd., Apt. #D, Pacific Palisades.

The plaintiff has met its initial burden by demonstrating that there is no dispute of material fact concerning its right to possession of the Premises. The plaintiff served written notices on May 30, 2023 and May 30, 2024, requiring payment of unpaid rent, and the defendants failed to pay the rent demanded within the periods specified by the notices.

The plaintiff also served Requests for Admissions on July 8, 2024, which were deemed admitted against the defendants on September 6, 2024. The admissions included facts such as the defendants' ownership of the Premises, their obligation to pay rent, and their failure to pay rent in accordance with the notices.

The defendants failed to respond to the Requests for Admissions, and therefore cannot dispute the admitted facts in opposition. The judge finds that the plaintiff has demonstrated that there is no triable issue of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Accordingly, the judge grants the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and orders that judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiff.
