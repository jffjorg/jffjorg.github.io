And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a trial continuance in this habitability case due to good cause. The plaintiff's counsel's father passed away on October 31, 2023, and counsel has been handling his affairs in Florida since November 1, 2023. The trial date is advanced to October 22, 2024, and the final status conference is set for October 11, 2024. The discovery and motions deadlines will be based on the new trial date. The judge has denied the request to advance the pending motions, finding that counsel should have noticed the depositions earlier to avoid this issue.
