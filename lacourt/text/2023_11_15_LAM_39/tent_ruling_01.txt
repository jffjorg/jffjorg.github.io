  Case Number:  21STCV34326    Hearing Date:   November 15, 2023    Dept:  39 JG Medical LLC v.
Purchasing 411, Inc.
Case No.
21STCV34326
Motions to Compel
 
            Defendant
and Cross-Complainant Purchasing 411, Inc. (“Defendant”) moved to compel
responses from Cross-Defendants Stop C-19 LLC and Gredale LLC
(“Cross-Defendants”) to: Requests for Production of Documents, set one (“RPD”);
and Special Interrogatories, set one (“SROG”). 
On July 5, 2023, Cross-Defendants’ counsel filed verified further
responses agreeing to produce the documents, rendering the motions moot.  (See Court’s Minute Order, dated July 10,
2023.)  As of October 19, 2023, Cross-Defendants
had not produced responsive documents. 
(See Declaration of Dan Terzian, ¶¶ 15-18.)  
 
            Defendants
move to compel production of the promised documents.  Under Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.320, the Court may compel a party to comply with its agreement to comply
with a request for production of documents. 
(See Code Civ Proc., § 2031.320, subd. (a).)  Counsel for Cross-Defendants did not file any
opposition to this motion.  The Court
finds no good cause for Cross-Defendants’ failure to honor their discovery
obligations.  
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the Court grants Defendants’ motion and orders the
Cross-Defendants to produce the following documents within 30 days:
 
1.         All
Gredale’s bank statements that contain any transactions relating to either (a)
transfers to or from Stop C-19 LLC or (b) transactions taken on behalf of Stop
C-19 LLC; 
 
2.         All
Gredale’s general ledger entries that relate to transfers to or from Stop C19
LLC; 
 
3.         All
Gredale’s bank statements that contain transactions related to the purchase of
PPE by Gredale or Stop C-19 LLC; 
 
4.         All
Gredale’s general ledger entries that relate to the purchase of PPE by Gredale
or Stop C-19 LLC; 
 
5.         All
Stop C-19’s general ledger entries that relate to transfers to or from Gredale
LLC; and 
 
6.         All
Stop C-19’s general ledger entries that relate to the purchase of PPE by Stop
C-19 or Gredale 19 LLC.
 
Defendant requests sanctions in the
amount of $3,000 against Cross-Defendants, jointly and severally.  The Court finds that their conduct
constitutes an abuse of discovery, warranting sanctions.  The Court finds that the requested amount is
fair and reasonable.  Therefore, the
request for sanctions is granted.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            Based upon the foregoing, the Court
orders as follows:
 
            1.         Defendants’ motion to compel is
granted.
 
            2.         Cross-Defendants shall produce the documents
at issue on or before December 22, 2023.
 
            3.         The Court orders Stop C-19 LLC and
Gredale LLC, jointly and severally, to pay sanctions in the amount of $3,000 to
Defendant Purchasing 411, Inc., by and through counsel, within 30 days.
 
            4.         The Court orders Defendant to provide
notice via email and file proof of service forthwith.
