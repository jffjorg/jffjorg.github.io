And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion for discovery filed by Plaintiff Rigoberto Vasquez, a Sergeant with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), against the City of Los Angeles. The Plaintiff alleges that LAPD Captain Johnny Smith used a racial epithet, which led to an internal affairs investigation, and that Captain Smith retaliated against him. The Plaintiff seeks discovery of peace officer personnel documents related to internal investigations of Captain Smith's conduct. The Court rules that the Plaintiff has satisfied the standard for an in-camera review of certain documents, including internal investigations of Captain Smith's complaints and allegations. However, the Court denies the Plaintiff's request for disclosure of other documents, finding them to be overbroad or protected by privilege. The Court orders an in-camera review of the approved documents and sets a date for the review.
