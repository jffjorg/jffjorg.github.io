 Case Number:  22STCV13356    Hearing Date:   November 15, 2023    Dept:  39 Carlos Patlan v.
Group V. San Bernardino, LP
Case No.
22STCV13356
Ex Parte
Application to Continue Trial Date and Shorten Time on Motions
 
Plaintiffs filed this habitability
case on April 21, 2022.  The Court held
the case management conference on October 18, 2022, and set trial for December
5, 2023.  On October 30, 2023, the
parties filed requests for informal discovery conferences.  Defendant sought to compel a site inspection,
and Plaintiff sought relief from tardy expert designation deadlines.  The Court denied the requests, as these
topics are not appropriate for an informal discovery conference.  Then, on November 8, 2022, Plaintiffs’ counsel
filed motions to compel depositions of Mike Nijjar (who is Defendant’s
President) and Sherri Wilson (who works for Defendant’s property manager).  Plaintiffs’ counsel served the deposition
notice for Mr. Nijjar on September 13, 2023. 
Plaintiffs’ counsel served the deposition notice for Ms. Wilson on
October 24, 2023.  
 
Now, Plaintiffs’ counsel seeks a
trial continuance because his father passed away on October 31, 2023, and he
has been in Florida since November 1, 2023, handling his father’s affairs.  Also, the hearings on Plaintiffs’ counsel’s
motions to compel are set for March 2024. 
This constitutes good cause. 
Therefore, the Court orders as follows:
 
1.         The
ex parte application is granted with respect to a trial continuance.
 
2.         The
Court advances and vacates the final status conference and trial dates.
 
3.         The
Court sets trial on its first available date as follows:
 
            Final
Status Conference:        October 11,
2024, at 9:00 a.m. 
 
            Trial:                                       October
22, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. 
 
The discovery and motions deadlines shall be based on the
new trial date.
 
            4.         The Court denies the ex parte
application to the extent it seeks to advance the pending motions, as the Court
has no availability to hear these motions on shortened time.  Moreover, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ counsel
should have noticed these depositions earlier to avoid this issue.  
 
            5.         Plaintiffs’ counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of such with the Court.
