Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the plaintiff, Sara Simms, to determine that the predispute arbitration agreement between the parties is invalid and unenforceable as to the sexual harassment dispute. The plaintiff alleges that she was sexually harassed by defendant Simon Ourian and that the sexual harassment dispute arose after March 3, 2022, when the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (EFAA) took effect.

The defendants argue that the sexual harassment dispute arose before March 3, 2022, and that the plaintiff waived her right to invoke the EFAA by not raising the issue earlier. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff did not know she had any right to invoke the EFAA until after the Court of Appeal decided Kader in January 2024, and that she did not waive her right to invoke the EFAA.

The judge also finds that the sexual harassment dispute arose after March 3, 2022, when the plaintiff filed her administrative complaint with the former Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) on April 22, 2022. The judge concludes that the predispute arbitration agreement is invalid and unenforceable as to the sexual harassment dispute and grants the plaintiff's motion.

The judge's ruling is significant because it applies the EFAA to the sexual harassment dispute and holds that the parties' predispute arbitration agreement is invalid and unenforceable as to that dispute. The ruling also highlights the importance of considering the date that a dispute arises in determining the applicability of the EFAA.
