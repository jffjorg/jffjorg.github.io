The judge has made a tentative ruling on the request from plaintiff Erin Bourne and defendant Redwood Lending Services to "retain jurisdiction" to enforce the terms of their settlement agreement and to enter a stipulated injunction. The court does not need to "retain jurisdiction" at this point, as it has jurisdiction until the case is dismissed or a judgment is entered. The proposed injunction is an interlocutory order, which will no longer be effective upon dismissal. If the parties seek an injunction that will survive the court's disposition of the case, it must be part of a judgment. The court declines to keep the case open for an indefinite and unlimited period without promise of adjudication. If the parties submit a stipulation that dismisses the action or enters judgment and states that the court shall retain jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement, the court will reconsider their request.
