And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. The demurrer filed by Defendant MKM Investments Operation LLC is taken off calendar. The Plaintiff, Michael Robinson, has filed a complaint against MKM Investments Operation LLC and Jeremy Thana, alleging breaches of contract and negligence. The Plaintiff has filed an amended pleading, adding Ocean Property's as a defendant, and alleging that Thana and others came to the Plaintiff's home, causing harm. The Court has construed the Plaintiff's March 15, 2024 amended pleading as an amendment to the first amended complaint. As the Plaintiff filed the amendment more than nine court days before the April 12, 2024 hearing on Defendant's demurrer, the Court takes the demurrer hearing off calendar.
