And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel further answers to deposition questions and has ordered the deponent, Sergio Ortiz-Vera, to answer the questions that were previously objected to on privacy grounds. The judge has also granted the defendant's request for monetary sanctions against K-VAC Environmental Services and its counsel, Aldo Flores, in the amount of $1,950.00. This is because the deponent's counsel's objections were not substantially justified and because the defendant's motion was successful. The judge has also ruled that the evidence pertaining to standard safety training, practices, and supervision protocol for personnel who performed work at the Lift Station is highly relevant to the case.
