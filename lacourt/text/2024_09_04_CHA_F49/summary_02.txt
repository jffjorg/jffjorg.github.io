The judge finds that Defendant's subsequent response to the interrogatories is in substantial compliance with relevant Code of Civil Procedure sections, and that Defendant's failure to serve a timely response was the result of excusable neglect. The judge has granted in part the request for monetary sanctions against Defendant and his attorney, ordering them to pay $686.65 to Plaintiff's attorney. The judge has also denied the motion as moot.
