MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO FORM
INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE; REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS

Los Angeles Superior
Court Case No. 23CHCV03549

 
Motion
filed: 5/13/24
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiffs Pablo Gaspar 
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Cole Baber 
NOTICE: OK.
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order from this Court compelling Defendant to serve verified responses, without
objection, to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and imposing monetary sanctions
against Defendant and his attorney of record, in the amount of $2,436.65.
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is DENIED as moot. The request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN
PART.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from alleged injuries that Plaintiffs
sustained in a vehicle accident on November 8, 2022.
 
On November 20, 2023, Plaintiffs Pablo Gaspar (“Pablo”) and
Joanna Gaspar (“Joanna”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) initiated this action against
Defendant Cole Baber (“Defendant” or “Baber”) and
Does 1 to 25, alleging (1) Motor Vehicle Liability, and (2) General Negligence.
Subsequently, Defendant filed his Answer to the Complaint on March 28, 2024.
 
On May 13, 2024, Plaintiff Pablo filed the instant Motion to Compel Defendant’s
Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One (the “Motion”). Additionally, Pablo
requests monetary sanctions against Defendant and his counsel.  
 
Subsequently, Defendant filed an untimely Opposition on
August 27, 2024, and Plaintiff filed their consequently late Reply on September
3, 2024.
 
ANALYSIS
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses and for a monetary sanction.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (b).)  The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel
where no responses have been served. All that needs to be shown in the
moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the
opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of
any kind has been served.  (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111
Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.) 
 
A.   
Timeliness
 
An opposition to a motion must generally be filed and served
at least nine court days, and all reply papers at least five court days before
the hearing (Code Civ. Procs., § 1005, subd. (b).) However, no paper may be
rejected for filing on the ground that it was untimely submitted for filing.
The court has discretion to refuse to consider a later filed paper. (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1300(d).)
 
            Here,
Defendant’s Opposition papers were filed on August 27, 2024, only six court
days prior to the hearing, thereby failing to meet the procedural time limit
under Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
            Defendant’s
counsel attests that on May 13, 2024, she informed Plaintiff’s counsel that the
link to the motion papers was inaccessible. (Tiller Decl. ¶ 11.) Although an
additional link was provided, she did not open it. (Ibid.) Defendant’s
counsel only learned of the hearing schedule upon checking the Court’s register
of actions on August 27, 2024. (Id. ¶ 15.)
 
            Based on
the above declaration, the Court, in its discretion, considers the argument
presented in both the untimely filed Opposition and in Plaintiffs’ consequently
late Reply.
 
B.    
Motion to
Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One
 
Plaintiff Pablo’s counsel
(“Counsel”) attests that on January 29, 2024, Defendant was served with the
first set of Form Interrogatories, to which responses were due on March 4, 2024.
(Sadeghian Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. “2.”) Having not received any responses by the due
date, Counsel sent Defendant’s counsel a written meet and confer letter on
April 4, 2024, requesting that Defendant serve responses, without objection, by
April 18, 2024. (Id. ¶ 6, Ex. “3.”) On March 28, 2024, Counsel sent
another meet and confer letter, again requesting written responses to
discovery.  (Id. ¶ 7, Ex. “4.”) Subsequently,
on April 18, 2024, Counsel sent an email to Defendant, granting an extension to
respond by May 2, 2024. (Tiller Decl. ¶ 8.) On May 14, 2024, Defendant emailed Counsel
the discovery responses. (Id. ¶ 11.) 
 
Based on the above records, the
Court determines that Defendant failed to serve a timely response.
Nevertheless, under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (a),
the court,
on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that
both of the following conditions are satisfied: ¶ (1) The party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections
2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. ¶ (2) The party’s failure to serve a
timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
 
Firstly, the Court notes that
Plaintiffs’ Reply
does not contest that Defendant’s subsequent response is in substantial
compliance with relevant Code of Civil Procedure sections.
 
Secondly,
the Court observes that the provision
in section 2030.290 regarding relief based on mistake, inadvertence and
excusable neglect is identical in most respects to the language and spirit of
section 473, subdivision (b). Both statutes serve similar purposes – to allow
relief where it serves the interests of substantial justice. The Court’s
discretion in granting such relief is not unlimited and must be exercised in conformity with the spirit of
relief intended by the statute so that substantial justice is served, not
defeated. Because the law favors that cases be tried and decided on their
merits, if there are any doubts whether relief should be granted, they must be
resolved in favor of the person seeking relief. (New Albertsons, Inc. v.
Superior Court (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1419.)
 
Based on the declaration submitted by Defendant’s counsel
and the application of relevant legal principles, the Court, in its discretion,
finds that Defendant has sufficiently demonstrated excusable neglect, thereby
justifying relief from the waiver that would preclude him from asserting any
objections to the interrogatories. The Court perceives no prejudice to
Plaintiff resulting from the delay, other than the need to pursue their case on
the merits.
 
Accordingly, the Court
DENIES the Motion as MOOT.
 
C.   
Monetary
Sanctions
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.290, subdivision (c), “[t]he Court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust....” Additionally, California Rules of
Court rule 3.1348(A) further provides, “The Court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed.” (Underlines added.)
 
Here, Defendant did not provide
responses to the Form Interrogatories within the timeframe set forth under Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.260. Although Defendant has subsequently served
his untimely responses, the Court finds that it is appropriate to impose
monetary sanctions. 
 
The Court determines the total and
reasonable amount of attorneys’ fees and costs incurred for the work performed
in connection with the Motion to be $686.65, calculated based on a reasonable
hourly rate of $250.00 for 2.5 hours reasonably spent, in addition to a $61.65
filing fee.
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS
IN PART Plaintiff Pablo’s request for monetary sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff Pablo Gaspar’s Motion to Compel Responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, is DENIED as MOOT.
 
Defendant
Cole Baber and his attorney of record are ordered to jointly and severally pay
$686.65 to Plaintiff’s attorney of record within 20 days.
 
Moving
