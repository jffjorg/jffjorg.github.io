And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Hartford Fire Insurance v. John Labib & Associates, regarding the defendant's request for costs. The case went to trial and resulted in a defense verdict. The defendant seeks to recover costs, including expert fees, of $35,118.80. The plaintiff argues that some of the claimed costs are not supported and that the defendant has not established entitlement to expert witness fees or the reasonableness of those fees.

The judge notes that the recovery of costs is limited to those permitted under California Civil Procedure Code section 1033.5(a), and that the costs must be "reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation." The judge also notes that the party challenging the costs bears the burden of demonstrating that the amounts were not "reasonable or necessary."

The defendant argues that the expert fees incurred after the service of a CCP §998 offer on June 26, 2024, are recoverable. The judge finds that the expert fees incurred prior to the CCP §998 offer are not recoverable under CCP §998(d). The judge also finds that the defendant has substantiated the requested fees and dates incurred with declarations and invoices, and that the fees are reasonable.

Based on the evidence presented, the judge denies the plaintiff's motion to tax costs.
