Hartford Fire Insurance v. John
Labib & Associates, Case no. 22SMCV00689
Hearing date November 4, 2024
Plaintiff
Hartford’s Motion to Tax Costs
Plaintiff
and subrogee for the Bradmore Group Hartford Fire Insurance Company sued
defendant John Labib & Associates, Structural Engineers for negligence
arising from cracked trusses at a commercial property in Marina Del Rey. The
case went to trial 7/8/24, and the jury returned a defense verdict. Defendant
filed and served a memorandum of costs seeking $35,118.80. Decl. Delinko para.
4. Plaintiff moves to tax costs, item no. 8b, claimed expert fees of $15,360.00,
arguing some claimed costs are not supported by the memorandum, defendant has
not established entitlement to an award of expert witness fees and has not
established the reasonability of those fees. 
Defendant
opposes, offering declarations of expert witnesses Zeno Martin, P.E., S.E., and
structural engineer Thomas A. Sabol, who testified at trial. Defendant notes
the memorandum of costs erroneously seeks $15,360; defendants actually seek $14,472.50.
CCP
§1032(b) provides a “prevailing party” may recover litigation costs. Not all
costs are recoverable and are limited to those permitted under CCP §1033.5(a). The
recovery of costs is limited to costs “reasonably necessary to the conduct of
the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation.”
CCP §1033.5(c)(2). The costs must be “reasonable in amount.” CCP §
1033.5(c)(3). The party challenging the memorandum of costs bears the burden of
demonstrating the amounts were not “reasonable or necessary.” Ladas v. CA
State Auto. Ass’n. (1993) 19 Cal. App. 4th 761, 774. However, “if the items
are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on
the party claiming them as costs.” Id.
The
award of expert witness expenses where there is a failure to accept a pretrial
CCP §998 offer is discretionary, not automatic. Santantonio v. Westinghouse
Broadcasting Co., Inc. (1994) 25 Ca. App. 4th 102, 121. Plaintiff argues
defendant served an offer to compromise for $50,000 pursuant to CCP §998
6/26/24, 6 days before trial. Decl. Delinko para. 5. Trial was scheduled for 7/8/24
and began 7/9/24, 14 days after service of the CCP §998 offer. The offer was
timely.
Expert
fees incurred prior to the CCP §998 offer are not recoverable. CCP §998(d). Plaintiff
argues defendant’s memorandum of costs only provides a single line entry
listing an amount for each expert without specifying the dates costs were
incurred. Defendant asserts all expert costs sought were incurred after 6/26/24.
See Decl. Martin para. 3, ex. B; Decl. Sabol para. 4, ex. D. Defendant
substantiated the requested fees and dates incurred with declarations and
invoices. All post-date the 998 offer. 
Plaintiff
argues the fees are not reasonable. Defendant seeks $470/hour for 12 hours of structural
engineer Sabol’s time. Decl. Sabol ex. C, D. Defendant seeks $270/hour for 32.8
hours of civil engineer Martin’s time. Decl. Martin ex. A. Both testified in this
case, which relied on expert testimony due to its technical nature. Defendant’s
incurred costs are reasonable. There is no basis to tax defendant’s requested
costs. DENIED.
