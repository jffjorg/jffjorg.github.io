“Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made may petition
the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award. The petition shall
name as respondents all parties to the arbitration and may name as respondents
any other persons bound by the arbitration award.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.) “A petition under this
chapter shall: (a) Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of the
agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of such an
agreement. (b) Set forth the names of the arbitrators. (c) Set forth or have
attached a copy of the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if
any.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.) “If a petition or response under this
chapter is duly served and filed, the court shall confirm the award as
made…unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and confirms
it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.) Any response to the petition
