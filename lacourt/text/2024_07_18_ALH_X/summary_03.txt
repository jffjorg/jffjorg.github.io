And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to set aside and vacate the judgment and stay of execution and proceedings. The judge finds that the motion is untimely and fails to raise any arguments under Code of Civil Procedure Section 663 that supports setting aside or vacating the judgment.

The judge grants the defendants' motion to correct the judgment, correcting a clerical error in the spelling of the plaintiff's name.

The judge grants the defendants' motion for attorneys' fees in the amount of $109,021.00, finding that the defendants are entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred on appeal and post-appeal. The judge rejects the plaintiff's objections to the declaration of the defendants' attorney, Jessica Weisel, and finds that the defendants' description of the work performed and the associated hours expended is adequate.
