And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendant's motions to quash the business record subpoenas served on non-parties Darryl Young, Jerry Acker, Jerry Acker Construction Consulting, All Pro Copper Repipes, Inc., and James E. Vitale. The subpoenas seek documents relating to the plaintiff's claims of unequal treatment by the defendant association. The court found that the subpoenas are relevant to the case and that the defendant's arguments for quashing the subpoenas are not supported by law. The court also found that the defendant has failed to establish a legally protected privacy interest in the records sought and that the burden is on the defendant to show that the records are not discoverable. The court's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and case law.
