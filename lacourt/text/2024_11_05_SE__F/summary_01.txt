And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied, without prejudice, Plaintiff NATIONAL COMMERCIAL RECOVERY, INC.'s unopposed motion to continue trial and related dates. The motion was filed because the plaintiff served Defendant Kenneth Redding with a request for admissions on August 13, 2024, and no responses were received. The trial is currently scheduled to begin on December 11, 2024, but the judge has denied the motion, indicating that the moving party (plaintiff) should give notice to the other parties.
