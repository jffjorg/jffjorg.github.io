```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the parties' requests and submissions and has made a tentative ruling. Stankovic, the cross-defendant, has applied for a good faith settlement determination, stating that he has entered into settlements with K and R Inc. and Plaintiff. However, the court cannot determine the existence or terms of these settlements based on the applications, and therefore cannot make findings about the good faith of the settlements. The court denies Stankovic's applications for good faith settlement determination and denies as moot the motions to challenge the applications. The parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service with the court within five days.
