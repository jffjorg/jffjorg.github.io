LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties and
the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A memorandum
of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal
of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579,
supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.   Damages 
          “Where a cause of action is stated in the complaint,
plaintiff merely needs to introduce evidence establishing a prima facie case
for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow,
Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal. Practice Guide), citing Johnson
v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred in applying
preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
          The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a defendant's
default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or, for personal
injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the amount
listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a), 585,
subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494 (Becker).) The statute insures that “defendants in cases
which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may
be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is
demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in
court—a right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p.
493.) A trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of
the amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at
p. 494; see Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:258,
p. 5-70.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff has submitted a complete default judgment application
with supporting evidence.  
Plaintiff’s statement of damages listed $24,215.00 in
medical expenses.  Plaintiff’s CIV-100
form requests $24,216.24 in special damages. 
The Court will grant the amount listed in the statement of damages. 
The Court grants the application and enters judgment
for Plaintiff for $1,024,819.88. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff Keith
Gibson’s application for default judgment against Defendant Vince Solomon filed
on February 8, 2024 and awards Plaintiff Keith Gibson $1,024,819.88.
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
