 Case Number:  23STCV21989    Hearing Date:   February 23, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
reviewed the petitions for expedited approval of minor’s compromises, the Court
rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
          On September 12, 2023, Plaintiffs Nancy
Rodriguez, Oscar Anthony Garcia, a minor by and through his guardian ad litem
Nancy Rodriguez, and Christopher Eli Lepe, a minor by and through his guardian ad
litem Maria Rodriguez, filed this action against Defendants Eddie James Washington,
Jr. ("Washington"), Enterprise Rental, and Does 1-100 for personal injuries. 
          On January 23, 2024, Petitioners Nancy
Rodriguez and Maria Rodriguez filed petitions for expedited approval of minor’s
compromises. 
PETITIONERS’ REQUESTS 
          Petitioners Nancy Rodriguez and Maria Rodriguez ask the
Court to approve the compromise of the claims of minors Oscar Anthony Garcia
and Christopher Eli Lepe. 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Oscar Anthony Garcia 
According to the petition, Claimant Oscar Anthony was
a passenger in a motor vehicle being operated by Petitioner Nancy Rodriguez.  Their vehicle was traveling northbound on St.
Andrews Place and was slowing down due to a dip in the roadway when Washington,
traveling eastbound on 49th Street at a high rate of speed, failed to yield at
a stop sign and collided with the rear end driver's side of the vehicle Claimant
was traveling in.  Claimant
suffered back strain and arm contusion due to the collision. 
GEICO General Insurance Company, the uninsured
motorist carrier, has agreed to pay $7,500.00 to settle Oscar Anthony Garcia’s
claims. 
The petition states that total medical expenses were
$1,161.11.  (Section 13a(1).)  This amount was reduced by $380.27 as the
result of negotiated, statutory, or contractual reductions.  (Section 13a(3).)  This should mean that $780.84 will be paid or
reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
However, the petition states that only $180.27 will be paid or
reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
(Section 13a(4).)  This leaves
$600.57 of the medical expenses unaccounted for. 
The
petition also states that Medi-Cal has asserted a lien for $720.84 and medical
services providers have asserted liens for $60.00.  It is unclear why Section 13a(4) of the petition
does not include these amounts.  (See,
e.g., Section 17b, Attachment 13a(5).) 
B.   Christopher Eli Lepe 
According
to the petition, Claimant Oscar Anthony was a passenger in a motor vehicle
being operated by Petitioner Nancy Rodriguez. 
Their vehicle was traveling northbound on St. Andrews Place and was
slowing down due to a dip in the roadway when Washington, traveling eastbound on
49th Street at a high rate of speed, failed to yield at a stop sign and
collided with the rear end driver's side of the vehicle Claimant was traveling
in.  Claimant suffered sprain/strain of the thoracic spine due to the collision. 
GEICO
General Insurance Company, the uninsured motorist carrier, has agreed to pay
$7,500.00 to settle Christopher Eli Lepe’s claims. 
The
petition states that total medical expenses were $2,212.24.  (Section 13a(1).)  This amount was reduced by $863.06 as the
result of negotiated, statutory, or contractual reductions.  (Section 13a(3).)  This should mean that $1,349.18 will be paid
or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
However, the petition states that only $500.00 will be paid or
reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
(Section 13a(4).)  This leaves
$849.18 of the medical expenses unaccounted for. 
The
petition also states that Medi-Cal has asserted a lien for $849.18 and medical
services providers have asserted liens for $500.00.  It is unclear why Section 13a(4) of the
petition does not include these amounts. 
(See, e.g., Section 17b, Attachment 13a(5).) The Court denies the petitions without prejudice.

          The Court DENIES the petition for expedited approval of the compromise
of minor Oscar Anthony Garcia’s claims filed by Nancy Rodriguez on January 23,
2024 without prejudice.

Court DENIES the petition for expedited approval of the compromise of minor Christopher
Eli Lepe’s claims filed by Maria Rodriguez on January 23, 2024 without
