And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the petitions for expedited approval of minor's compromises filed by Nancy Rodriguez and Maria Rodriguez. The petitions seek to approve the compromise of the claims of minors Oscar Anthony Garcia and Christopher Eli Lepe, who were passengers in a motor vehicle operated by Nancy Rodriguez. The vehicle was involved in a collision with a vehicle operated by Eddie James Washington Jr. Both minor claimants suffered injuries and GEICO General Insurance Company has agreed to pay $7,500.00 to settle the claims.

However, the Court notes that there is an issue with the petition's accounting of the medical expenses. The petition states that only $180.27 and $500.00 will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds, respectively, but the total medical expenses are $1,161.11 and $2,212.24, respectively. The Court also notes that Medi-Cal and medical services providers have asserted liens for medical expenses, but these amounts are not included in the petition.

As a result, the Court denies the petitions without prejudice. The petitioners are ordered to give notice.
