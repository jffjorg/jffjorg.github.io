The Judge also grants the request for sanctions of $452.00. The motion was filed by Defendant Harbor Dispatch Transport, Inc. and seeks to compel Plaintiff's responses to special interrogatories. The Plaintiff had failed to serve timely responses and had objected to the special interrogatories, despite waiving those objections by failing to serve a timely response. The Judge denied the Plaintiff's request for relief from waiver without prejudice. The Judge also found that the Plaintiff's counsel had agreed to provide code-compliant responses in exchange for the motion being taken off calendar, but did not provide evidence that Harbor's counsel had agreed to take the motion off calendar.
