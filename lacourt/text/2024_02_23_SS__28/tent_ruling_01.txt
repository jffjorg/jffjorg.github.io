PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff’s
CIV-100 form requests that the Court enter a default judgment against Defendant
and award Plaintiff $10,541,234.48, consisting of $10,000,000.00
in general damages and $541,234.48 in special damages. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties and
the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A memorandum
of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal
of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579,
supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.   Damages 
          “Where a cause of action is stated in the complaint,
plaintiff merely needs to introduce evidence establishing a prima facie case
for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow,
Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal. Practice Guide), citing Johnson
v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred in applying
preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
          The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a defendant's
default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or, for personal
injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the amount
listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a), 585,
subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494 (Becker).) The statute insures that “defendants in cases
which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may
be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is
demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in
court—a right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p.
493.) A trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of
the amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at
p. 494; see Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:258,
p. 5-70.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff’s CIV-100 form requests $10,541,234.48,
consisting of $10,000,000.00 in general damages and $541,234.48 in special
damages.  However, Plaintiff’s JUD-100
form requests $10,561,284.00.  Plaintiff’s
declaration requests $10,561,284.34. 
Plaintiff should revise his application to make the damages
requests consistent. 
Plaintiff’s request for special damages is based on a December
30, 2022 letter from the Department of Health Care Services providing “an
estimate of injury-related services paid to date by the Medi-Cal Program" for Plaintiff.  The letter states
that the “[e]stimated amount” of $541,234.48 is “NOT THE FINAL MEDI-CAL LIEN
AMOUNT” and it instructs Plaintiff not to remit payment “until a final review
has been conducted and you receive the final lien amount.” 
In his declaration, however, Plaintiff’s counsel asserts
that “$561,284.34” (an amount the Court does not see in the Department of
Health Care Services letter) is the “total lien amount” for Medi-Cal.  (Dourian Dec. ¶ 3.)  Counsel states that “the State of California has
not provided our office with any further or supplemental lien amounts, and I am
unaware of any other liens claimed in this matter.”  (Dourian Dec. ¶ 3.) 
As the Department of Health Care Services letter
states, “[i]n the event that an updated estimate is required for a legal
proceeding, [Plaintiff] must provide advanced notice and documentation of the
upcoming event to the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) 30 days prior
to the proceeding.”  Counsel does not
state whether he has requested an updated estimate from the Department of
Health Care Services. 
For the reasons stated above, the Court denies the
application without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff Corentin Villemeur’s application
for default judgment against Defendant Elvis Guevara Vasquez, aka Elvis Orlando
Guevara, aka Elvis Orlando Guevara Vasquez, filed on January 31, 2024, without
prejudice. 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
