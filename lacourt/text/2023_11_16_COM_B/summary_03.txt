And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion by counsel for Defendant/Cross-Complainant Hector Flores to be relieved as counsel due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The court finds that the address for service of notice is unclear and that the declaration submitted by counsel does not meet the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362. As a result, the court continues the hearing to December 10, 2023, and orders counsel to file a supplemental declaration addressing the discrepancy.
