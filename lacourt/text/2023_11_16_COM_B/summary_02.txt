Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff's request to strike the First Amended Cross-Complaint and granting Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions. The judge found that Defendant failed to comply with the Court's September 14, 2023, order to provide substantive, code-compliant responses to Plaintiff's discovery requests. Despite this, the judge did not find that a terminating sanction and striking the First Amended Cross-Complaint was warranted. Instead, the judge granted an additional monetary sanction in the amount of $1,465.00 and ordered Defendant to pay Plaintiff $1,465.00 in sanctions and to comply with the September 14, 2023, order by the end of day on November 27, 2023.
