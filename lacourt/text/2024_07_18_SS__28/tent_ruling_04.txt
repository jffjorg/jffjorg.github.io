LEGAL STANDARD  
          Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b),
provides in part: 
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve
a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order,
or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall
be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b).) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 473.5 provides: 
“(a) When service of a summons has not resulted in
actual notice to a party in time to defend the action and a default or default
judgment has been entered against him or her in the action, he or she may serve
and file a notice of motion to set aside the default or default judgment and
for leave to defend the action. The notice of motion shall be served and filed
within a reasonable time, but in no event exceeding the earlier of: (i) two
years after entry of a default judgment against him or her; or (ii) 180 days
after service on him or her of a written notice that the default or default
judgment has been entered. 
“(b) A notice of motion to set aside a default or
default judgment and for leave to defend the action shall designate as the time
for making the motion a date prescribed by subdivision (b) of Section 1005, and
it shall be accompanied by an affidavit showing under oath that the party’s
lack of actual notice in time to defend the action was not caused by his or her
avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect. The party shall serve and file
with the notice a copy of the answer, motion, or other pleading proposed to be
filed in the action. 
“(c) Upon a finding by the court that the motion was
made within the period permitted by subdivision (a) and that his or her lack of
actual notice in time to defend the action was not caused by his or her
avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect, it may set aside the default or
default judgment on whatever terms as may be just and allow the party to defend
the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision
(b) 
Defendant
asks the Court to set aside the default judgment because it was based on inadvertence, surprise, and excusable neglect for purposes of Code of
Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). 
The
Court cannot set aside the default under Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (b), because Defendant did not move for relief until more than six
months after the May 10, 2023 default.  As a result, the Court also cannot set aside the default judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (b), because “that would be ‘an idle act.’ ” (Pulte Homes
Corp. v. Wiliams Mechanical, Inc. (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 267, 273, quoting Howard
Greer Custom Originals v. Capritti (1950) 35 Cal.2d 886, 888 (Capritti).)  “ ‘ “If the judgment were vacated, it would
be the duty of the court immediately to render another judgment of like effect,
and the defendants, still being in default, could not be heard in opposition
thereto . . . .” ’ ” (Ibid., quoting Capritti, supra, 35
Cal.2d at pp. 888–889; see L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2024) ¶ 5:414.1, p.
5-121 (Cal. Practice Guide); Weiss v. Blumencranc (1976) 61
Cal.App.3d 536, 541; Koski v. U–Haul Co. (1963) 212 Cal.App.2d 640, 643.) 
The
Court therefore concludes that Defendant is not entitled to relief under Code
of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). 
B.   Relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5 
Defendant
argues the Court should grant relief under Code of Civil Procedure section
473.5 because “Defendant was not in the
office on the day of service and was never personally served with the
complaint.”  (Motion p. 5.)  The only evidence Defendant presents to
support this assertion is its counsel’s declaration that “My client has
informed me they were not in the office on the day they were allegedly
personally served, and never was served with a copy of the complaint. My
client’s first notice of the case was the Default Judgment on April 8, 2024 [sic].”  (Doty dec. ¶ 4.) 
“Admissible
evidence is required to justify relief under [Code of Civil Procedure section
473.5].  Declarations containing inadmissible
hearsay do not suffice.”  (Cal. Practice
Guide, supra, ¶ 5:431.1, p. 5-125.) 
Counsel’s
statement is inadmissible hearsay.  The
Court denies the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Defendant Angelus Funeral Home’s motion to set aside the default judgment. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
