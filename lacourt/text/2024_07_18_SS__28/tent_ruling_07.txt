PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Defendant
asks the Court to impose terminating and monetary sanctions against Plaintiff. 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to deny the motion for terminating sanctions. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Monetary and terminating
sanctions 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 provides in part: 
“To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court,
after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity
for hearing, may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in
conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process: 
“(a) The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney
advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. The court may
also impose this sanction on one unsuccessfully asserting that another has
engaged in the misuse of the discovery process, or on any attorney who advised
that assertion, or on both. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision
of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.  * * *
“(d) The court may impose a terminating sanction by
one of the following orders: 
“(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of
the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process. 
“(2) An order staying further proceedings by that
party until an order for discovery is obeyed. 
“(3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of
the action, of that party. 
“(4) An order rendering a judgment by default against
that party. . . ." 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030, subds. (a), (d).)         
B.       Sanctions
for failure to comply with Court order to respond to demand for inspection 
          Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.300, subdivision (c), provides in part: 
“If a party . . . fails to obey [an] order [under Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision (b)] compelling a response [to
a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling], the court may make
those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to this sanction, the court may
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)         
C.      Sanctions
for failure to comply with Court order to respond to interrogatories 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (c), provides in part: 
“If a party then fails to obey an order [under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (b)] compelling answers [to
interrogatories], the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)         

D.   Terminating sanctions for failure to comply with
discovery orders 
A
violation of a discovery order supports the imposition of terminating
sanctions. (Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th
1611, 1620.) Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in
disobeying the court's orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d
771, 795-796 (Deyo).) 
A
terminating sanction is a "drastic measure which should be employed with
caution." (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) "A
decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a
violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery
rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280 (Mileikowsky).)   
DISCUSSION 
On
February 20, 2024, the Court (1) granted Defendant’s motion
to compel Plaintiff’s responses to request for production of documents, set
one, and ordered Plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant responses and to
produce the documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things
requested without objections by March 19, 2024, (2) granted Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to special interrogatories,
set one, and ordered Plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant responses to
the special interrogatories without objections by March 19, 2024, and (3)
granted Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses
to form interrogatories, set one, and ordered Plaintiff to provide verified
code-compliant responses to the form interrogatories without objections by
March 19, 2024. 
Defendant
has moved for terminating and monetary sanctions,
arguing Plaintiff has not complied with the February 20, 2024 order.  According to Defendant, Plaintiff served
incomplete and unverified responses to the interrogatories on April 8, 2024, after
the March 19, 2024 deadline, and had not served any responses to the request
for production of documents or produced any documents by the time Defendant
filed this motion. 
On
June 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed a declaration from his counsel with what appear to
be verified code-compliant responses to the outstanding discovery. 
The
Court denies Defendant’s request for terminating sanctions.  Defendant has shown that Plaintiff violated
one discovery order and has not shown that less severe sanctions would be
ineffective in producing compliance with the discovery rules. (See Mileikowsky,
supra, 128 Cal.App.4th at pp. 279-280.) 
Defendant
requests $3,937.50 in monetary sanctions based on approximately 7.5 hours of
attorney time to draft the motion for terminating sanctions at an hourly rate
of $525.00.  The Court awards $750.00 in
sanctions based on three hours of attorney time at a reasonable rate of $250.00
per hour. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES in part and GRANTS in part Defendant
Hollywood Gym, Inc.’s motion for terminating and monetary sanctions as follows. 
The
Court DENIES Defendant Hollywood Gym, Inc.’s
motion for terminating sanctions. 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Hollywood Gym, Inc.’s motion for monetary
sanctions and orders Plaintiff Gregory Hoffman and his counsel to pay Defendant
Hollywood Gym, Inc. $750.00 by August 19, 2024. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling within five days.
