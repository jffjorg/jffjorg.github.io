On

On
June 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to deem admitted matters specified in
requests for admission, set one, served on Munoz, and for sanctions.  The motion was set for hearing on July 18,
2024.  Munoz did not file an opposition. 
PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission,
set one, served on Munoz and to impose sanctions. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides:           
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The requesting party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280.)  
DISCUSSION 
On March
6, 2024, Plaintiff served requests for admission, set one, on Munoz.  Munoz did not serve timely responses and had
not served responses by the time Plaintiff filed this motion. 
The
Court grants the motion and deems admitted the matters specified in the requests
for admission served on Munoz. 
Plaintiff
requests sanctions of $1,500.00 based on three hours of attorney time at an hourly
rate of $500.00 per hour.  Counsel spent one
hour preparing the motion and anticipated spending approximately one hour
reviewing Munoz’s opposition and preparing Plaintiff’s reply and one hour
attending the hearing.  The Court grants
$500.00 in sanctions based on two hours of attorney time at a reasonable rate
of $250.00 per hour. 
CONCLUSION

Court GRANTS Plaintiff Makenna S. Pound’s
motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission, set one,
served on Defendant Gonzalo Munoz.  The
