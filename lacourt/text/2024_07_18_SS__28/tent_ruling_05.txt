BACKGROUND 
On November
2, 2022, Plaintiff Progressive Select Insurance Company
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Jonathan
Castillo (“Defendant”) and Does 1-20 for motor vehicle tort.  The complaint demanded $42,352.40.   
Also
on November 2, 2022, Plaintiff filed a statement of damages asserting property damage
of $10,252.40 and uninsured motorist bodily injury payments of $32,100.00, for
a total of $42,352.40. 
On December
2, 2022, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing substituted service on
Defendant of the summons, complaint, statement of damages, and other documents
on November 20, 2022. 
On
April 16, 2024, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. 
On
April 22, 2024, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
Also
on April 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for default judgment. 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff asks the Court to enter a default judgment
against Defendant and award Plaintiff $42,871.40, consisting
of $42,352.40 as the demand of the complaint and $519.00 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a
cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal.
Practice Guide), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357,
361 [trial court erred in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
          Plaintiff
has submitted a complete default judgment application with all required
information.  The Court grants the
application. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff Progressive Select Insurance Company’s application for default judgment filed on April 22,
2024.  The Court awards Plaintiff Progressive
Select Insurance Company $42,871.40 against Defendant Jonathan Castillo. 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
