And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion for terminating and monetary sanctions filed by Defendant Hollywood Gym, Inc. against Plaintiff Gregory Hoffman. The Court granted Defendant's motion to compel Plaintiff's responses to interrogatories and request for production of documents, but Plaintiff failed to comply with the order. Despite this, the Court denies Defendant's request for terminating sanctions, finding that less severe sanctions would be effective in producing compliance with the discovery rules. The Court awards Defendant $750.00 in monetary sanctions, representing three hours of attorney time at a reasonable rate of $250.00 per hour. The Court denies Defendant's motion for terminating sanctions and orders Plaintiff and his counsel to pay the awarded sanctions by August 19, 2024.
