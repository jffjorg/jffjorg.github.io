And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition to approve the compromises of the claims of minor plaintiffs Katrina Culver and Landon Culver. The petition was filed by Paul Culver, the guardian ad litem for the minor plaintiffs, on June 17, 2024. The judge's ruling is based on the petition and attachments filed by the parties. Specifically, the judge is concerned that the petition does not provide sufficient information to show that Medicare paid for any of the medical expenses, and that the attachment referred to as the "Final Medicare agreement" is a letter from the Rawlings Company, not Medicare. As a result, the judge is denying the petition without prejudice, meaning that the parties can re-file the petition with additional information. The judge is ordering Paul Culver to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service with the court within five days.
