```

And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment. The defendant, Angelus Funeral Home, argues that the default judgment should be set aside because it was based on inadvertence, surprise, and excusable neglect. However, the judge finds that the defendant did not move for relief until more than six months after the default, which is outside the time limit allowed by Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). Additionally, the judge concludes that the defendant's lack of actual notice was caused by its avoidance of service, rather than excusable neglect. The judge further finds that the defendant's evidence is inadmissible hearsay and therefore denies the motion.
