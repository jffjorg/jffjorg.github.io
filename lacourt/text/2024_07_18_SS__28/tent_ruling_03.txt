 Case Number:  22STCV28221    Hearing Date:   July 18, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
August 30, 2022, Plaintiffs Paul Culver, Landon Culver, a minor by and through
his guardian ad litem Paul Culver, and Katrina
Culver, a minor by and through her guardian ad litem Paul Culver, filed this
action against Defendants Karina Del Carmen Hussey (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50
for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. 
On
September 6, 2022, the Court appointed Paul Culver to serve as guardian ad
litem for Plaintiffs Katrina Culver and Landon Culver. 
On
January 24, 2024, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
June 10, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement. 
On June
17, 2024, Petitioner Paul Culver (“Petitioner”) filed petitions for expedited
approval of minor’s compromises. 
PETITIONER’S REQUESTS 
Petitioner
asks the Court to approve the compromises of the claims of Plaintiffs Katrina
Culver and Landon Culver. 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Katrina Culver 
The petition
states that both Medicare and the claimant’s health plan will be reimbursed from
the settlement proceeds for $1,440.00 in medical expenses.  (Sections 13b(2), 13d.)  Petitioner should explain whether both
Medicare and the health plan are receiving this amount as reimbursement (and if
so, why).  (Section 17b of the petition
shows only one reimbursement of $1,440.00.) 
Attachment
13b(2) describes a November 30, 2022 letter from the Rawlings Company as the “Final Medicare agreement.”  (Attachment 13b(2).)  It is unclear why a letter stating that The
Rawlings Company is to receive $1,440.00 is a Final Medicare agreement.  The petition does not provide any information
showing that Medicare paid for any of the medical expenses.  If Medicare is to receive $1,440.00 in
reimbursement, Petitioner should explain why the attachment refers to The
Rawlings Company and not to Medicare. 
(The proposed order states that $1,440.00 will be paid to The Rawlings
Company and does not mention Medicare.) 
For
the reasons stated above, the Court denies the petition. 
B.   Landon Culver 
The
petition states that $1,845.00 in medical expenses will be reimbursed from the
settlement proceeds to Medicare.  (Section
13b(2).)  However,
the attachment described as the “Final Medicare agreement” is a November 30,
2022 letter from the Rawlings Company.  (Attachment
13b(2).)  The letter states that The
Rawlings Company is to receive the reimbursement.  The petition does not provide any information
showing that Medicare paid for any of the medical expenses.  If Medicare is to receive $1,845.00 in reimbursement,
Petitioner should explain why the attachment refers to The Rawlings Company and
not to Medicare.  (The proposed order
states that $1,845.00 will be paid to The Rawlings Company and does not mention
Medicare.) 
For
the reasons stated above, the Court denies the petition. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES without prejudice the petition to
approve the compromise of minor Plaintiff Katrina Culver’s action filed by
Petitioner Paul Culver on June 17, 2024.

Plaintiff Landon Culver’s action filed by Petitioner Paul Culver on June 17,
2024.

is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
