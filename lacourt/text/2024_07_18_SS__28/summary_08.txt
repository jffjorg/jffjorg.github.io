And here is the English text summary:

The judge issues a tentative ruling granting Plaintiff Ardemis Yarijanian's motion to file a first amended complaint. The original complaint alleged general negligence and premises liability, but Plaintiff seeks to add a strict liability claim. The judge finds that the motion is timely and that the granting of the motion will not prejudice the opposing party. The judge notes that the new claim is based on the same facts as previously alleged and that Defendants have not asserted they will suffer prejudice as a result of the new claim. The judge grants the motion and orders Plaintiff to file and serve the first amended complaint within 30 days of the hearing.
