As a result, the Court grants the motion to compel and orders Defendant to produce its Person Most Qualified for deposition and to produce documents related to the case.

The Court has also ordered Defendant to produce documents and information related to its lemon law policies and procedures, as well as any "buy back manual" provided to decision-makers. The Court has imposed sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $1800 for failing to respond to Plaintiff's multiple attempts to meet and confer.

The Court has also granted Plaintiff's request for production of documents and information related to the Subject Vehicle, including any photographs or videos of the vehicle.
