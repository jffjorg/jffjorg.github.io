I.           
INTRODUCTION
On November
 16, 2022, plaintiffs Krikor Kassabian and Christina Chobanian
filed this action against defendants City of
 Glendale (“City”) and Frunzik Sargsyan (“Sargsyan”) arising from motor
 vehicle collision that occurred on September 30, 2021.  
On January 3, 2024, the Court ordered
Sargsyan to serve verified responses, without objections, to City’s Form
Interrogatories, Set One, by March 4, 2024. 
On July 30, 2024, City filed this
motion requesting that the Court impose $1,500 in sanctions due to Sargsyan’s
failure to serve responses as ordered. 
On August 22, 2024, Sargsyan filed an
opposition brief stating that responses would be served before the hearing. On
August 28, 2024, responses were served, but the responses included objections.
Therefore, on August 29, 2024, the Court continued the hearing on this motion and
gave City and Sargsyan opportunities to file supplemental briefs on whether
Sargsyan had complied with the Court’s prior order to serve responses. Briefs
were filed by City and Sargsyan on September 13 and October 22, 2024,
respectively. 
II.         
DISCUSSION
On August 28, 2024, Sargsyan served
responses to Form Interrogatories. He asserted objections in response to Form
Interrogatories 14.1, 20.1 to 20.11, even though the Court’s prior order on
January 3, 2024 (“January 3 Order”), specifically stated that verified
responses, without objections, were to be served because Sargsyan waived all
objections when he failed to serve responses within the time limit to do so. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) The Court reiterates its January 3 Order
and again notes that while it has the power to grant relief from a waiver of
objections on noticed motion, no such motion is pending here. (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 2030.290(a).) 
Therefore, Sargsyan’s responses do not
evidence compliance with the Court’s January 3 Order and the Court considers
whether sanctions should be imposed. In Sargsyan’s supplemental brief, his
counsel, Maria Grover, describes the multitude of problems she has encountered
in attempting to locate and communicate with her client. However, Ms. Grover
was apparently able to sufficiently communicate with her client to provide
responses to some of the form interrogatories in question. Therefore, the
decision to assert objections, without having first filed a motion for relief
from the waiver of those objections, was a willful violation of the Court’s
order issued 10 months ago. Accordingly, the Court imposes sanctions on Defendant
in the amount of $300 consisting of 1 hour at a reasonable hourly rate of $300,
to be paid within 30 days of the date of this Order, unless objection-free
responses are served or a motion for relief from the waiver of objections is
filed within that time. 
III.       
CONCLUSION
City’s motion for sanctions is GRANTED
and imposed against Sargsyan in the amount of $300, to be paid within 30 days. 
Moving party to give notice.
