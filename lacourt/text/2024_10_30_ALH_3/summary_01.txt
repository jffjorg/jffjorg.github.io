And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the City's motion to enforce a discovery order against defendant Frunzik Sargsyan. The City had requested that the Court impose $1,500 in sanctions on Sargsyan due to his failure to serve responses to the City's Form Interrogatories. Sargsyan had previously filed an opposition brief stating that he would serve responses before the hearing, but he did not comply with the Court's order to serve responses without objections. The Court has imposed sanctions on Sargsyan in the amount of $300, consisting of 1 hour at a reasonable hourly rate of $300, to be paid within 30 days. The Court has also ordered that Sargsyan serve objection-free responses or file a motion for relief from the waiver of objections within 30 days.
