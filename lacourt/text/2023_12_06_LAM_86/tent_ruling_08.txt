[1] The court cites to Petitioner’s record, Respondent’s
supplemental record, and Petitioner’s reply record as “Rec.”    


[2] Financial Impacts and Related to COVID-19 are defined
in the Resolution and discussed infra.


[3] Conflict
does not merely refer to a conflict in language. It can refer to a conflict of
jurisdiction where the Legislature has adopted a general scheme for the
regulation of a particular subject. (American Financial Services Assn. v.
City of Oakland (2005) 34 Cal.4th 1239, 1252-1253.) The conflict of
jurisdiction is similar to finding the Legislature implicitly intended to fully
occupy the subject area.


[4] Arguably, nonpayment of rent constitutes a “substantial violation of a material term
of the tenancy” and could fall within
this notice provision from Rental
Housing Assn. of Northern Alameda County v. City of Oakland.  However,
Petitioner cites the codified version of the Oakland ordinance, which appears
to show that an additional notice and cure requirement beyond three days is not
imposed with respect to nonpayment of rent. (Reply 9-10 fn. 3.)  Respondent may address this issue at the
hearing.


[5] Further, Petitioner does not explain how the Resolution
could be structured to provide the intended protection from eviction without a
self-certification component.  


[6] The court acknowledges the cited legislative history arguably
shows an intent to authorize local legislation that provides substantive
limitations on eviction due to nonpayment of rent accruing on or after April 1, 2022.  Nonetheless, because the court denies the
petition on other grounds, the court finds it unnecessary to decide the
point.
