[Tentative]       ORDER
DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 
 
 
Petitioner, Duke Ahn, M.D., seeks a writ of administrative
mandate directing Respondent, George Parisotto, as the Administrative Director
of the Division of Workers’ Compensation of the Department of Industrial
Relations of the State of California, to set aside an administrative decision
suspending Petitioner from participating as a physician, practitioner or
provider in California’s workers’ compensation system pursuant to Labor Code
section 139.21, subdivision (a)(1)(A)(i).[1]  
 
BACKGROUND
 
Petitioner Pleads
Guilty to Accepting Illegal Kickbacks 
 
On May 10, 2019, Petitioner entered a
guilty plea to violating Business and Professions Code section 650 as a
misdemeanor.[2]
(AR 131-137.)  Petitioner offered the
following hand-written factual basis for his plea:
 
On or about and between April 4, 2014 to August 12,
2015, I was a licensed physician in the State of California and I received
consideration as compensation or inducement for referring patients to Tanya
Moreland King and her businesses One Source Labs and King Medical Management in
Orange County. (AR 134.)
 
After Petitioner pled guilty, the
Court placed Petitioner on three years of probation and ordered him to pay
$80,114 in restitution, $8,000 to the Victim Witness Emergency Fund, and other
fines/fees. As a condition of probation, Petitioner agreed to abstain from
practicing in the workers’ compensation system, except for emergencies during
probation. (AR 136-137.)
 
The plea form states: “Defendant
permitted to withdraw his plea of guilty upon successful completion of
probation and DA will move to dismiss case entirely.” (AR 137.)  
 
Petitioner Obtains Dismissal of the
Criminal Case
 
On August 20, 2020, Petitioner moved
the court to terminate his probation early and dismiss his case pursuant to
Penal Code section 1385 “pursuant to plea agreement.” (AR 156.) Petitioner
submitted proof he had paid all required restitution and fines/fees as evidence
in support of his motion. (AR 155-156.) The court, “in the interest of
justice,” granted Petitioner’s motion to dismiss pursuant to Penal Code section
1385 over the People’s objection.  (AR 156.)[3]
 
Administrative Proceedings
 
On August 23, 2022, Respondent issued
a Notice of Provider Suspension to suspend Petitioner from participating as a
physician, practitioner or provider in California’s workers’ compensation
system on the grounds Petitioner had “been convicted of a crime described in
Labor Code section 139.21(a)(1)(A).” (AR 30-32.) Petitioner timely requested a
hearing, and an administrative law judge (ALJ) conducted an evidentiary
hearing. 
 
On September 29, 2022, the ALJ issued
a written recommendation to suspend Petitioner from participating in the workers’
compensation system pursuant to Labor Code section 139.21, subdivision (a)(1)(A).
(AR 220-225.)  On September 30, 2022, Respondent
adopted the ALJ’s recommendation and issued a final order suspending Petitioner
from participating in California’s workers’ compensation system as a physician
or practitioner. (AR 226-227.)
 
STANDARD OF REVIEW 
 
Petitioner
seeks relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. 
 
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, subdivision (b), the issues for review
of an administrative decision are: whether the respondent has proceeded without
jurisdiction, whether there was a fair trial, and whether there was a
prejudicial abuse of discretion.  An
abuse of discretion is established if the respondent has not proceeded in the
manner required by law, the decision is not supported by the findings, or the
findings are not supported by the evidence. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5, subd.
(b).)
 
“The courts must decide on a case-by-case
basis whether an administrative decision or class of decisions
substantially affects fundamental vested rights and thus requires independent judgment review.” (Bixby v.
Pierno (1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 144.) “ ‘In determining whether the right is fundamental the courts do not
alone weigh the economic aspect of it, but the effect of it in human terms and
the importance of it to the individual in the life situation.’ . . . . The
ultimate question in each case is whether the affected right is deemed to be of
sufficient significance to preclude its extinction or abridgement by a body
lacking judicial power.”
(Benetatos v. City of Los Angeles (2015)
235 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1281.) 
 
Neither party sufficiently addresses
whether the administrative decision implicates a fundamental vested right such
that judicial review of the agency’s factual findings are subject to the court’s
independent judgment.  As discussed
below, the writ petition primarily raises a question of statutory construction—an
issue the court decides de novo. To the extent the court also reviews
the fact findings, the court reaches the same result on the writ petition
regardless of whether the independent judgment or substantial evidence test
applies.   
 
In a
mandate proceeding under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, Petitioner
bears the burden of proof to demonstrate, by citation to the administrative
record, the evidence does not support the administrative findings. (Strumsky v. San Diego County Employees
Retirement Assn. (1974) 11 Cal.3d 28, 32; Steele v. Los
Angeles County Civil Service Commission (1958) 166 Cal. App. 2d 129, 137.) A reviewing court “will not act as
counsel for either party to an appeal and will not assume the task of
initiating and prosecuting a search of the record for any purpose of
discovering errors not pointed out in the briefs.” (Fox v. Erickson (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d 740, 742; see also Shenouda v. Veterinary Medical Bd. (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th 500, 513.)  
 
“ ‘On questions of law arising in mandate
proceedings, [the court] exercise[s] independent judgment.’ ” (Christensen v. Lightbourne (2017) 15
Cal.App.5th 1239, 1251.)  The
interpretation of statute or regulation is a question of law. (See State
Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Quackenbush (1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 65, 77.)  
 
“The rules governing statutory
construction are well settled. We begin with the fundamental premise that the objective
of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.
[Citations.] To determine legislative intent, we turn first to the words of the
statute, giving them their usual and ordinary meaning. [Citations.] When the
language of a statute is clear, we need go no further. However, when the
language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation, we look to
a variety of extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved,
the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy,
contemporaneous administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which
the statute is a part.” (Nolan v. City of
Anaheim (2004) 33 Cal.4th 335, 340.)

ANALYSIS 
 
The Weight of the Evidence as well as Substantial
Evidence Supports the Agency’s Findings[4]
 
In an
administrative writ proceeding, “the challenger must identify (with citations
to the record) the factual findings made by the board that he or she is
challenging and demonstrate (with citations to the record) why those factual
findings were against the weight of the evidence.”  (Shenouda
v. Veterinary Medical Bd. (2018)
27 Cal.App.5th 500, 513.) Here, Petitioner’s Opening Brief does not challenge
any of the agency’s factual findings related to the nature of his guilty plea
and conviction prior to the court’s dismissal pursuant to Penal Code section
1385. Rather, Petitioner’s sole contention is he “suffered no conviction” after
the criminal case was dismissed pursuant to Penal Code section 1385 and,
therefore, Respondent lacked grounds to suspend him as a physician,
practitioner or provider from California’s workers’ compensation system
pursuant to Labor Code section 139.21. (See Opening Brief 3-4.) The legal issue
is addressed infra. 
 
The court concludes the weight of the evidence, and substantial
evidence, supports all administrative factual findings related to the nature of
Petitioner’s guilty plea and conviction. 
(AR 220-225.) The court also concludes Petitioner’s guilty plea and
conviction for receiving illegal kickbacks “involve[] fraud
or abuse of the federal Medicare or Medicaid programs, the Medi-Cal program, or
the workers’ compensation system, or fraud or abuse of any patient,” as found
by the ALJ and Respondent.[5]
(See Lab. Code, § 139.21, subd. (A)(1)(A)(i).) 
Petitioner has developed no argument to the contrary.  Accordingly, unless Penal Code section 1385
overrides Labor Code section 139.21, Respondent was required to “promptly
suspend” Petitioner from California’s workers’ compensation system.[6]  
 
///
Labor Code Section 139.21 Required
Petitioner’s Suspension Based on His Guilty Plea and Penal Code Section 1385
Does Not Override Section 139.21
 
Petitioner contends he “suffered no conviction” after the court
dismissed his criminal case pursuant to Penal Code section 1385. Accordingly,
Petitioner argues Respondent lacked grounds to suspend him from the workers’
compensation system pursuant to Labor Code section 139.21. (Opening Brief 4:7-11.)
Petitioner’s argument is unpersuasive because he selective reads Labor Code
section 139.21.
 
Labor Code section 139.21,
subdivision (a)(4) states in pertinent part: 
 
For purposes of this section
and Section 4615, an individual or entity is considered to have been
convicted of a crime if any of the following applies: (A) A judgment of
conviction has been entered by a federal, state, or local court, regardless of
whether there is an appeal pending or whether the judgment of conviction or
other record relating to criminal conduct has been expunged. . . . (C) A
plea of guilty has been accepted by a federal, state, or local court.
(Emphasis added.)
 
Respondent correctly notes a person may be subject to
suspension from the workers’ compensation system under Labor Code section
139.21, subdivision (a)(1) for a qualifying criminal conviction if either:
(1) a judgment has been entered against such person, regardless of whether the
judgment has been expunged; or (2) a plea of guilty has been accepted by
a court.  Respondent argues both of these
criteria are satisfied in this case. Petitioner has not responded to
Respondent’s arguments in a reply brief. (See Sehulster Tunnels/Pre-Con
v. Traylor Brothers, Inc. (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1328, 1345, fn. 16
[failure to address point is “equivalent to a concession”].)  
 
On May 10, 2019, Petitioner pled guilty to violating Business and
Professions Code section 650 for receiving compensation in exchange for
referrals—that is, accepting kickbacks. (AR 131-137.) Petitioner’s guilty plea is
statutorily defined as a “conviction” within the meaning of Labor Code section
139.21, subdivisions (a)(1)(A)(i) and (a)(4)(C). Thus, Petitioner’s guilty plea
constituted a conviction under Business and Professions Code section 139.21
requiring Respondent to suspend Petitioner from participating as a physician,
practitioner or provider in California’s workers’ compensation system. (Lab.
Code, § 139.21, subds.
(a)(1) and (a)(4)(C).)
 
The court need go no further. Petitioner’s guilty plea, accepted by
a state court, required Respondent to suspend Petition from California’s
workers’ compensation system. (Id. at subd. (a)(1).) Accordingly,
Petitioner is not entitled to any relief here. Petitioner makes no argument
otherwise.
 
Respondent also argues Petitioner “entered a plea and a judgment
was pronounced by the court.” (Opposition 9:20-21.) Petitioner does not respond
to Respondent’s assertion in reply seemingly conceding the issue. (See AR
131-139; Pen. Code, § 1193; Sehulster
Tunnels/Pre-Con, supra, 111 Cal.App.4th at 1345, fn. 16 [“equivalent to a concession”].) Accordingly,
Respondent was also required to suspend Petitioner from participating in the
workers’ compensation system based on Petitioner entering his plea and the
court’s pronouncement of judgment.
 
The court recognizes on August 20, 2020, the criminal court granted
Petitioner’s motion to dismiss his criminal case pursuant to Penal Code section
1385. (AR 156.)
 
Petitioner argues “even when there is a plea agreement, if the
court grants a dismissal pursuant to PC 1385 prior to the termination or
completion of probation, no final judgement or conviction is entered.” (Opening
Brief 4:2-4.) Petitioner further contends: “Without a final judgment, the
determination in state court is merely temporary and not final and thus it
would be an error to consider a tenuous decision as a final judgment or
‘conviction.’ Thus, the Administrative Law Judge's conclusions are erroneous
and against black letter law.” (Opening Brief 4:2-4.)
 
Petitioner looks to support for his position from People v.
Chavez (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 110 [Chavez]: 
 
In cases involving a request for dismissal of accusations or an
information against a defendant after the period of probation has ended, the
Legislature has provided clear legislative direction that the courts do not
have authority under section 1385 to grant the requested
relief. Section 1203.4 is the
exclusive method by which a court can dismiss the conviction of a defendant who
has successfully completed probation. (Id. at 122.)  
 
Petitioner’s reliance on Chavez is misplaced. As argued by
Respondent, Chavez and the California Supreme Court’s decision in People
v. Tanner (1979) 24 Cal.3d 514 [Tanner], discussed in Chavez,
support Respondent’s position that Penal Code section 1385 does not supersede or
override Labor Code section 139.21 as applied to this case.  
 
Chavez analyzed the differences between Penal
Code sections 1203.4 and 1385: 
 
Section 1203.4 applies to probationers whose period of probation
has ended. . . . [D]ismissal under section 1203.4 does not erase a conviction;
it ‘merely frees the convicted felon from certain ‘penalties and disabilities’
of a criminal or like nature.’ . . . Section 1385 is different. Pursuant to
that section, a judge or magistrate may, on his or her own motion or upon
application of the prosecuting attorney, and in furtherance of justice, order
an action dismissed. (§ 1385.) A dismissal pursuant to section 1385 may be proper before,
during, or after trial. [Citation.] Unlike a dismissal under section 1203.4, ‘the
effect of a dismissal under section 1385 is to wipe the slate clean
as if the defendant never suffered the prior conviction in the initial
instance. In other words, ‘[t]he defendant stands as if he had never been
prosecuted for the charged offense.’ [Citations.]  (Chavez, supra, 5 Cal.App.5th at 116.)
 
The Chavez Court concluded Penal Code section 1203.4 provided
the authority for a defendant to seek a dismissal after successfully completing
probation. The Court reasoned as follows: 
 
The Legislature could not have intended to preserve the court’s
discretionary power to dismiss under section 1385 when it mandated dismissal
in a later-enacted statute with the same restorative effect that specifically
addressed the dismissal of accusations or an information against a successful
probationer. . . (Tanner, supra,
24 Cal.3d at pp. 519-520.) A contrary interpretation would
nullify the original section 1203.4. ‘Under
well-established rules of construction, any inconsistency between the two
provisions would be resolved by applying the more specific provision.’” (Chavez,
supra, 5 Cal.App.5th at 119.)
 
The Chavez Court relied on the California Supreme Court’s
decision in Tanner.  As summarized
in Chavez:
 
[t]he California Supreme Court considered whether a trial
court could use section 1385 to strike a firearm
allegation and thereby avoid the mandatory prohibition in section
1203.06.  (Tanner, supra, 24
Cal.3d at p. 518 [].) The Court said no, the mandatory provisions of
section 1203.06 could not be avoided by employing section 1385. . . . To hold otherwise would
nullify section 1203.06 and restore prior law allowing a trial court to grant
probation anytime it deemed such a grant appropriate in the interests of
justice. . . . The Court observed that ‘whereas section 1385 is general in nature,
relating to the broad scope of dismissal, section 1203.06 is specific, relating
to the limited power of dismissal for purposes of probation—the very matter at
issue.’ . . . . In addition, section 1203.06 is ‘the later enactment, adopted
by the Legislature in response to the particular problem at hand.’ ” (Chavez,
supra, 5 Cal.App.5th at 117-118 [quoting and discussing People v. Tanner
(1979) 24 Cal.3d 514, 518-521].)
 
Analogizing to Chavez and Tanner, Respondent contends
“Petitioner’s attempt to apply the general law pursuant to Penal Code §1385
overwrites the will of the Legislature” in Labor Code section 139.21 and
“should be rejected.” (Opposition 9:17-19.) Respondent’s arguments, especially
in the absence of any response from Petitioner, are persuasive.  
 
Labor Code section 139.21 is a specific statute that governs the
circumstances in which Respondent must suspend any provider of medical
treatment from participating in the workers' compensation system if the
provider has been convicted of certain types of felonies or misdemeanors. (See
generally Barri v. Workers’ Comp Appeals Board (2018) 28 Cal. App.5th
428, 443-444.) Labor Code section 139.21 was first enacted in 2016 and was
amended in 2017.  (See ibid.) In
contrast, Penal Code section 1385 was first enacted in 1872 and is “general in
nature” and relates to the “broad scope of dismissal” in criminal actions. (Chavez,
supra, 5 Cal.App.5th at 117-118.)  “A
specific provision relating to a particular subject will govern a general
provision, even though the general provision standing alone would be broad
enough to include the subject to which the specific provision relates.” (Chavez,
supra, 5 Cal.App.5th at 117-118.)
 
Petitioner interprets Labor Code section 139.21 such that a
criminal court’s dismissal of an action pursuant to Penal Code section 1385 has
the effect of “wiping the slate clean” as if the defendant had never been
prosecuted for the charged offense or pleaded guilty to the charged offense. That
interpretation, however, would effectively nullify Labor Code section 139.21
with respect to all criminal prosecutions that are dismissed pursuant to Penal
Code section 1385.  Petitioner cites no
statutory language or legislative history related to Labor Code section 139.21
suggesting the Legislature intended that result. As the more specific and later-enacted
provision, Labor Code section 139.21 governs this case and any inconsistencies
with section Penal Code section 1385 must be resolved in favor of applying
section Labor Code section 139.21. (Chavez, supra, 5 Cal.App.5th at
119.) 
 
Most importantly, as argued by Respondent, the Legislature’s intent
that Labor Code section 139.21 apply broadly to the circumstances of this case
is clear. Specifically, the Legislature stated Respondent must suspend the
medical practitioner if a judgment of conviction has been entered, “regardless
of whether there is an appeal pending or whether the judgment of conviction
or other record relating to criminal conduct has been expunged.”  (Lab. Code, 
§ 139.21, subd. (a)(4)(A) [emphasis added].) The Legislature also
stated “an individual or entity is considered to have been convicted of a crime
if . . . a plea of guilty has been accepted by a federal, state, or local
court. (Id. at subd. (a)(4)(C).)  In
addition, the focus is upon an initial finding of guilt without regard to what
may follow that finding. (Lab. Code, § 139.21, subd. (a)(4)(A) [pending appeal of no
consequence]. This statutory language demonstrates an intent for Labor Code section
139.21, subdivision (A)(1) to apply broadly and even to criminal convictions
that have been dismissed pursuant to Penal Code section 1385.
 
Based on the foregoing, Petitioner has not shown any prejudicial
abuse of discretion in the administrative decision suspending Petitioner from
participating as a physician, practitioner or provider in California’s workers’
compensation system pursuant to Labor Code section 139.21.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5, subd. (b).) The
agency’s decision is supported by the weight of the evidence, substantial
evidence and the law.  
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The petition is denied.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
