[1] As described in the court’s October 20, 2023 order,
the Ritter Ranch Project is a master-planned community consisting of
approximately 7,200 residential units and approximately 700,000 square feet of
commercial uses. (AR 3712.) The City approved the Ritter Ranch Project pursuant
to Specific Plan 89-02, EIR 90-04, a General Plan Amendment and Pre-Zone 89-12.
(AR 3712.)


[2] That entitlements may have expired does not inform on
whether the Project is in conformity with EIR 90-04 and the Specific Plan. Hagopian
v. State of California (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 349, 369 is not helpful here;
unlike the non-existent local coastal program, EIR 90-04 and the Specific Plan
do exist. Conformity can therefore be measured against them.


[3] Petitioner’s argument would equally apply to the City.
Like Real Party, the City filed a cross-complaint alleging Petitioner breached
the Settlement Agreement. The City has joined Real Party’s argument related to
the Settlement Agreement and waiver. The City’s first and second affirmative
defenses are identical to those of Real Party—breach of contract and
waiver/release.


[4] While Petitioner takes issue with Real Party’s
reliance on Nicholson v. Barab as “not applicable” because it concerned
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 (Final Reply 9 n. 4), the case is
authority for the general proposition contracts may be enforced in different
ways, including as an affirmative defense.
