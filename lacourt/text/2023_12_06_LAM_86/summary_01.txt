And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the writ proceeding brought by LEONA VALLEY TOWN COUNCIL against the CITY OF PALMDALE. The City had sought to challenge the Project approvals, but the judge has found that the Settlement Agreement entered into by the parties waives and releases any claims related to the Project approvals. The judge has concluded that the Settlement Agreement precludes this proceeding and bars relief to Petitioner. The judge has also found that the City's waiver and release in the Settlement Agreement is enforceable against the City, and that the City cannot argue that it did not release its claims. The judge has further found that the Settlement Agreement's broad release language applies to all future governmental approvals related to the Project, including the Phase 1A Project.
