Summary:

The tentative ruling denies the petition for a writ of mandate to overturn the administrative decision suspending Dr. Duke Ahn from participating in California's workers' compensation system. The decision is based on Dr. Ahn's guilty plea to receiving illegal kickbacks and his conviction under Labor Code section 139.21. The court finds that the Legislature's intent was for Labor Code section 139.21 to apply broadly and that the general provisions of Penal Code section 1385 do not override the specific provisions of Labor Code section 139.21.
