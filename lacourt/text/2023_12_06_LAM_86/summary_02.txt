This tentative ruling addresses the Ritter Ranch Project, a master-planned community with residential and commercial units. The City approved the project under Specific Plan 89-02 and EIR 90-04, a General Plan Amendment and Pre-Zone 89-12. The judge is considering whether the project is in conformity with these documents, despite potential entitlements expiring. The ruling also addresses the Settlement Agreement between the parties, with Real Party arguing that Petitioner breached the agreement. The judge notes that contracts can be enforced in different ways, including as affirmative defenses. The ruling also references a previous case, Hagopian v. State of California, and another case, Nicholson v. Barab.
