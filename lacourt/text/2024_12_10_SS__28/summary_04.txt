And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. The plaintiff, Myron Mackey, filed an action against multiple defendants, including Trap Karaoke, LLC, on August 26, 2022. Trap filed an answer and cross-complaint, and the defendants Belasco and Live Nation filed an answer and cross-complaint. Trap then filed a motion for determination of good faith settlement regarding its settlement with the plaintiff. The motion was set for hearing on September 10, 2024, but was continued to December 10, 2024. No opposition was filed.

The judge notes that the California Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6 provides that a party to an action may request a hearing to determine the good faith of a settlement entered into by the plaintiff and one or more alleged tortfeasors. The judge cites the case of Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) for the nonexclusive factors courts must consider in determining if a settlement is in good faith.

The judge concludes that Trap has submitted a barebones motion which sets forth the ground of good faith and a brief background of the case. No opposition has been filed, and therefore the judge grants the motion. The judge orders that the settlement be deemed made in good faith and dismisses all pending and future claims against Trap Karaoke, LLC by the parties represented by counsel served with this motion.
