And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion to consolidate two cases, 22STCV02323 and 24CMCV00236, and has denied the motion. The motion was filed by the plaintiffs, TC Nevada, LLC, and TLC Luxury, LLC, and seeks to combine the two cases for trial. However, the judge has found that the motion does not comply with the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a). Specifically, the motion did not list all the parties in each case, nor did it contain the captions of all the cases sought to be consolidated. The judge has therefore denied the motion and ordered the parties to give notice of this ruling.
