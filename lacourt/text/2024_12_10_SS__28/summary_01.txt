Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion for terminating sanctions filed by the defendant, Margaret Mary Lewis, against the plaintiff, Malvina Mkchyan. The defendant seeks to impose terminating sanctions on the plaintiff for failing to comply with the court's order to appear and testify at a deposition and to pay $1,191.65 in sanctions. The judge has denied the defendant's request for terminating sanctions, finding that the plaintiff's violation of the discovery order was not willful and that less severe sanctions would be effective in producing compliance with the discovery rules. Instead, the judge has ordered the plaintiff to comply with the court's order by December 24, 2024, and has ordered the defendant to make all reasonable arrangements to ensure that the plaintiff can attend a deposition by that date.
