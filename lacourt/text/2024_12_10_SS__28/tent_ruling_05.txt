 Case Number:  22STCV39295    Hearing Date:   December 10, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
December 19, 2022, Plaintiff Carla Gipson as guardian ad litem for minor Alex
Polk filed this action against Defendants City of Los Angeles (“Defendant”) and
Does 1-10 for premises liability. 
On
May 30, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
May 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement. 
On September
19, 2024, Petitioner Carla Gipson (“Petitioner”) filed a petition for expedited
approval of the compromise of minor Plaintiff Alex Polk’s claims. 
On
September 23, 2024, the Court appointed Petitioner to serve as guardian ad
litem for Plaintiff Alex Polk. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court to grant the petition for expedited approval of the compromise
of the action of minor Plaintiff Alex Polk (“Plaintiff”). 
DISCUSSION 
The petition provides the following information: 
Gross settlement amount:                    $15,000.00
Total medical expenses:                       $2,399.00
Medical expenses paid:                        $448.66
Reductions:                                          $242.44
To be paid/reimbursed:                        $242.44
Liens:                                                   $242.44
          Attorney’s
fees:                                   $3,750.00
          Costs:                                                   $545.00
          Net
settlement amount:                        $10,462.56

           Section
13a(1) of the petition states that total medical expenses were  $2,399.00. 
Section 13a(3) of the petition states that the medical expenses were
reduced by $242.44.  That should mean
that the remaining medical expenses ($2,156.56) will be paid or reimbursed from
the settlement proceeds.  However,
Section 13a(4) of the petition states that only $242.44 will be paid or
reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
As a result, $1,914.12 of the medical expenses remain unaccounted
for.  The Court cannot grant a petition
unless it shows that all medical expenses that have not been waived or reduced
will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
          Attachment
13(a) appears to state that Orthopedic Hospital Medical Group charged $2,088
for its medical services and Medi-Cal paid $448.61.  (The Court notes that the February 16, 2023 letter from the Department of Health Care Services attached to the petition states that Plaintiff received $323.25 in Medi-Cal benefits.  It is unclear why the petition states that Medi-Cal paid $448.61.)  If Attachment 13(a) is saying that Orthopedic
Hospital Medical Group reduced its charges by allowing Medi-Cal to satisfy the
bill for $2,088.00 by paying $448.61, then the difference between these figures
($1,639.30) is a reduction amount that should be included in Section 13a(3) of
the petition.  However, Petitioner should
determine if this reduction amount is correct. 
CONCLUSION
  The
Court DENIES without prejudice the petition to approve the compromise of minor
Plaintiff Alex Polk’s claims filed by Petitioner Carla Gipson on September 23,
2024. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
