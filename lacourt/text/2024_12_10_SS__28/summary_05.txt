And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied, without prejudice, a petition to approve a compromise of a minor's claims against the City of Los Angeles. The petition was filed by Carla Gipson, the guardian ad litem and petitioner, seeking approval of a settlement worth $15,000.00. The settlement includes medical expenses of $2,399.00, but the court found that the petition did not adequately account for all of these expenses. Specifically, the court noted that the petition stated that only $242.44 of the medical expenses would be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds, but that $1,914.12 of the medical expenses remained unaccounted for. The court also questioned the accuracy of a reduction amount listed in the petition and ordered the petitioner to determine if this amount is correct. The judge has given notice of this ruling and ordered the petitioner to file proof of service with the court within five days.
