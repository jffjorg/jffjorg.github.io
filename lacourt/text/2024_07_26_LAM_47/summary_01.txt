And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

On July 26, 2024, Judge Theresa M. Traber issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Los Angeles Clinica Medica General Medical Center, Inc.'s motion to consolidate four cases, including the current unlawful detainer action Atlantic Management LLC v. Los Angeles Clinica Medica General Medical Center, Inc. (Case No. 23STCV28108). The motion was filed to consolidate this case with three other unlawful detainer actions with the same title and with a civil action entitled Los Angeles Clinica Medica General Medical Center Inc. v. Atlantic Management LLC (Case No. 24STCV13007). However, the Court found that the Defendant failed to comply with the procedural requirements for a motion to consolidate, including listing the parties who have appeared in each case, listing the names of the respective attorneys of record, and providing a proof of service. As a result, the Court denied the motion.
