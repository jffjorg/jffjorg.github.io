  Case Number:  22STCV38968    Hearing Date:   January 9, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Motion of Plaintiff for Attorney's Fees and
Costs.  
 
The unopposed motion is granted, as prayed.
 
On 12/15/22, Plaintiff filed a Complaint alleging that
self-represented defendants Ken Trimmer and Claudia Trimmer breached a written
commercial lease of  real property, by
not paying rent due.  The causes of
action are:  1) Breach of the Lease
Agreement;  2)  Account Stated;  and  3)
Money Had and Received.
On 8/9/23, the Court granted summary judgment in favor
of Plaintiff and against Defendants, and entered judgment against Defendants.
In their motion before the Court, Plaintiff requests
an award of attorneys’ fees in the amount of $11,391.25 and costs in the sum of
$l ,250.00.  Bases for those requests
include:  1) Plaintiff is the prevailing
party against Defendants because the Court filed a Judgment against Defendants;  and 2) 
Plaintiff is entitled to recover its attorney's fees and costs pursuant
to Civil Code Section 1717, Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1032 and 1033.5,
Rules 8.104 and 3.1702 of the California Rules of Court, and the prevailing
party attorney’s fees provision in the subject lease agreement between the
parties.
The failure to file a proper and timely opposition in
trial court creates a waiver of the issues on any appeal.  Bell v. Am. Title Ins. Co. (1991) 226
Cal. App. 3d 1589, 1602.   A party appearing without a lawyer is not
entitled to any greater privileges than an attorney.  Bianco v. California Highway Patrol
(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1125-1126;  Morgan
v.  Ransom (1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 664,
669;  Bistawros v.  Greenberg (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 189,
193;  Burnete v. La Casa Dana
Apartments  (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
1262, 1267.
“ ‘In challenging attorney fees as excessive because
too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party
to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and
citations to the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are excessive,
duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.’ ” 
Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488.  Accord 
Etcheson v. FCA US LLC (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 831, 848.  Parties opposing motions for attorneys' fees
fail to show any abuse of discretion unless they file an opposition setting
forth a specific analysis or factual support.  E.g., Mallard v. Progressive Choice
Ins. Co.  (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 531,
545.
If items appear on their face to be proper, the
verified memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence of their propriety,
shifting the burden of proof to the attacking party.  Adams 
v. Ford Motor Co. (2011)  199
Cal.App.4th 1475, 1486-87;  Benach v.
County of L. A. (2007) 149 Cal. App. 4th 836, 855;  Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal. App.
4th 111, 131-32 (“trial court erred in requiring additional proof from” the
party claiming costs, where the party attacking costs had the burden);  Santantonio v. Westinghouse Broad. Co.
(1994) 25 Cal. App. 4th 102, 116, 121 (after a prima facie showing based on
verified cost memorandum, objecting party has the burden to prove costs should
be disallowed);  Ladas v. Cal. State
Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773; 
Rappenecker v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc. (1979) 93 Cal. App. 3d 256,
266.  
In this case, Defendants have not filed any opposition
to meet their burden to challenge the attorneys’ fees and costs.  The Court agrees with Plaintiff that is it is
entitled to fees pursuant to the fees provision in the lease agreement. The
Court’s review of the declarations submitted by counsel demonstrate that the lodestar
figure, i.e., the reasonable hours spent on the case (19.25) multiplied by the
prevailing hourly rate for attorneys in the community is appropriate and
reasonable. The Court notes that Plaintiff’s exhibit 8, which contains the
billing statements for Plaintiff’s attorneys, is not attached to the motion.
The Court directs Plaintiff to bring a copy of exhibit 8 to the hearing for the
Court to review and confirm the information contained in the declarations regarding
the work done on the case. Defendants have not challenged the requested costs and so those are also granted.
