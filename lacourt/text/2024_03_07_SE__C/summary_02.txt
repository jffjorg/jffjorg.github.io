```

**Significant Statements**
```
"The undisputed facts establish that the Regional Center does not have the ability to control J.C. and, therefore, no special relationship exists between the Regional Center and J.C. that could give rise to a duty." (Shalghoun, supra, 99 Cal.App.5th 139, 158)
"Regional Centers do not themselves directly provide any services or support to consumers." (Morohoshi, supra, 34 Cal.4th at 489)
"Evidence that a regional center had the ability to control a consumer, but failed to do so, is not sufficient to establish a duty to protect a third party." (Shalghoun, supra, 99 Cal.App.5th 139, 163)
```

**Tentative Ruling**
```
The Court concludes that TCRC has no duty to protect Plaintiff under the facts of this case. Summary adjudication of the first through third claims is proper because TCRC owes no legal duty of care to Plaintiff.
