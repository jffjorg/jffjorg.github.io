English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Cross-Defendant ELIZABETH AMAYA to the First Amended Cross-Complaint. The court has overruled Amaya's demurrer on the grounds of uncertainty, finding that the allegations of the First Amended Cross-Complaint are sufficient to state a claim. The court has also overruled Amaya's demurrer on the grounds of sham pleading, finding that the added facts in the First Amended Cross-Complaint do not create inconsistency with the prior pleadings. Additionally, the court has overruled Amaya's demurrer on the grounds of res judicata, finding that the dismissal of the Meckler Trust's claims against Cross-Complainant does not bar Cross-Complainant's claims against Amaya. Finally, the court has overruled Amaya's demurrer on the grounds of bona fide purchaser for value, finding that the First Amended Cross-Complaint raises factual determinations that cannot be decided at this stage of the litigation. The court has ordered Amaya to give notice of the ruling.
