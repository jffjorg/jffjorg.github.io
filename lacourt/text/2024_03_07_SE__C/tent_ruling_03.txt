Background
 
This lawsuit was filed on June 12, 2020 by Plaintiff
Bernardo Schaffer (Plaintiff) against Defendants K&M Meat Company, Inc.
(Defendant K&M) and Defendant Felix Goldberg.  Defendant K&M owns, manages, and/or
controls the property located at 2443 E. 27th Street, Vernon, California.
(Complaint, ¶ 2.) Defendant Felix Goldberg is the trustee of the Felix Goldberg
Trust, and the trust is an owner of the property. (Id., ¶ 3.) On February 21,
2019, Plaintiff sustained injury on the property when he fell through the floor
of the second story down to the first story of the premises. (Id., ¶¶ 9, 12.)
Based thereon, Plaintiff asserts causes of action for: 1. Negligence 2.
Premises Liability.

Discussion
 
When the Court granted Summary Judgment in favor of
Defendant K&M on August 25, 2024, the matter had been under submission
since August 9, 2023, and the Court was unaware that Plaintiff filed his
Acceptance of Offer and Proposed Judgment on August 22, 2023.  Plaintiff’s Proposed Judgment was not sent to
this Court for review; rather, it was sent to Dept. SE-F for review by Judge
Rosales.  Judge Rosales denied
Plaintiff’s Proposed Judgment on September 26, 2023 after it “reviewed the
Offer to Compromise and Acceptance Under Code of Civil Procedure Section 998,
Objection to Plaintiff Bernardo Schaffer's Proposed Judgment pursuant to
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1590(j), and declaration of Vanessa K.
Herzog.” (Minute Order, September 26, 2023.) 
Had this Court been aware of Plaintiff’s Proposed Judgment at the time
it was filed, it likely would not have issued the order granting Summary
Judgment in favor of Defendant K&M. 
The Court likely would have scheduled a hearing regarding Plaintiff’s
Proposed Judgment before taking further action on the summary judgment
motion.  
 
At the hearing on February 29, 2024, the Court addressed the
concerns raised by Defendant K&M in its August 29, 2023 objection to
Plaintiff’s Proposed Judgment.  Neither
party mentioned Judge Rosales’s September 26, 2023 order denying the Proposed
Judgment.  The Court determined that a
fully executed Settlement Agreement was reached by the parties on August 16,
2023.  Only after issuing that Order did
this Court discover that Plaintiff’s Acceptance of Offer and Proposed Judgment
was denied by Judge Rosales on September 26, 2023. 
 
If asked to reconsider the Court’s February 29, 2024 order
at this time, the Court would be inclined to vacate the order and leave in
place the denial entered by Judge Rosales. 
It is now apparent to this Court that Plaintiff’s Motion to Enforce
Settlement was in effect a motion to reconsider Judge Rosales’s September 26,
2023 order.  Because Judge Rosales is
available to hear such a motion, the motion was improperly brought before this court.  A motion for reconsideration must be addressed
to the same judge if available: “[O]ne trial court judge may not reconsider and
overrule a ruling by another trial court judge.” (Davcon Inc. v. Roberts
& Morgan (2008) 110 Cal.App.4th 1355, 1361.)  Therefore, Plaintiff’s remedy lies with Judge
Rosales, not with this Court.  
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Ex Parte Application Renewing its
Motion to Enforce Settlement is DENIED. 
 
The Court defers ruling on Defendant K&M’s Proposed
Judgment until March 28, 2024 to allow Plaintiff an opportunity to seek relief
in Dept. SE-F.  If no application for
relief is made by that date, or if relief is sought and denied, the Court will
enter judgment in favor of Defendant K&M pursuant to the Court’s August 25,
2023 order granting Defendant K&M’s motion for summary judgment.
