And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is continuing the plaintiff's application for an order of issuance of writ of attachment in the amount of $185,696.37 to March 28, 2024, at 10:30 a.m. The application was filed by Martha Sandoval, the guardian ad litem for Maria Sandoval, who is the real party in interest. However, Maria Sandoval passed away after the action was filed. The defendant argues that Martha Sandoval lacks standing to present the motion, but the plaintiff argues that since there is a guardian ad litem in the case and no law requires the denial of the motion if a party dies after it is filed, the argument must be dismissed. The court notes that no application for substitution of the decedent's personal representative or successor in interest has been filed, and that no motion to dismiss has been filed. The court will continue the motion to allow for further proceedings.
