And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint is placed off-calendar due to the defendant's failure to comply with CCP §430.41. The plaintiff had filed the original complaint on September 28, 2022, and the First Amended Complaint on October 5, 2023, alleging negligence, elder abuse, willful misconduct, and wrongful death. The defendant had demurred to each cause of action, and the matter was continued to March 7, 2024, to allow the defendant to comply with CCP §430.41. However, as of March 4, 2024, no declaration in compliance with CCP §430.41 has been filed, and the matter is therefore placed off-calendar.
