 Case Number:  21NWCV00477    Hearing Date:   March 7, 2024    Dept:  C JAUREGUI v. CHAVEZ
CASE NO.:  21NWCV00477
HEARING: 03/07/24
 
#2
 
Defendants’ JORGE CHAVEZ; LUZ CHAVEZ; and JASMIN CHAVEZ’s
unopposed Motions to Set Aside Default are GRANTED.  
 
Moving Party to give Notice. 
 
Defendants’ Proposed Answer attached to the Declaration of Richard
Rosiak is not deemed filed. Defendants are ORDERED to file the Proposed
Answer within five court days of the Court’s issuance of this Order. 
 
Default was entered against Defendants Jorge Chavez, Luz
Chavez, and Jasmin Chavez on September 13, 2023. 
 
Defendants now move to set aside the defaults under CCP
§473(b). 
 
CCP § 473(b), states that “[t]he court may…relieve a party or his or her
legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding
taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.” 
 
The policy of hearing cases on
their merits is well-established. (See, e.g., Berman v. Klassman (1971)
17 Cal.App.3d 900.) The law favors trials on the merits. (Rappleyea
v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 980.) 
 
On February 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Notice of
Non-Opposition. 
 
The unopposed Motion is GRANTED.
