Garibay v. Maria Chavez, Case No. 23NWCV03013
 
This
is an unlawful detainer action. Plaintiff George Garibay, a pro per plaintiff,
applies for ex parte relief to set aside or vacate the dismissal of the case
under Code of Civil Procedure sections 473, subdivision (b); Code of Civil
Procedure section 473.5; Civil Code section 1788.61; and the Court’s inherent
duty and power. Plaintiff did not appear for trial, and the Court dismissed the
case. 
 
The
Court will not hear the motion today because it was not brought by noticed
motion. A motion to set aside default brought under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473.5 must be brought by noticed motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5,
subd. (a).)
 
The
Court denies the motion.
