The judge has granted the motion for distribution of funds filed by the defendants/cross-complainants, AAA SOLAR ELECTRIC, INC. and PHILADEPHIA INDEMNITY INSURANCE COMPANY and SAFETY NATIONAL CASUALTY CORP. The court has reviewed the objections to the proposed order filed by the plaintiff/judgment creditor, WNG CONSTRUCTION JV, INC. and sustained them. As a result, Swiss Re Corporate Solutions America Insurance Corporation Bond #2343660 will be fully discharged and the company will be forever released and exonerated by WNG CONSTRUCTION JV, INC. from any further liability under the bond, limited to the appeal bond number affected. However, the court notes that the issues of overpayment and/or whether the judgment has been paid in full were not properly noticed for this hearing date and are improperly adjudicated at this time. The moving party is not foreclosed from seeking these orders via a separately noticed motion if necessary.
