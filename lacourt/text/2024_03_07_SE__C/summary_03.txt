```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's ex parte application to renew their motion to enforce a settlement agreement. The court will defer ruling on the defendant's proposed judgment until March 28, 2024, to allow the plaintiff an opportunity to seek relief in Department SE-F. If no application for relief is made or if relief is sought and denied, the court will enter judgment in favor of the defendant. The court's decision is based on the fact that the plaintiff's proposed judgment was denied by Judge Rosales on September 26, 2023, and the plaintiff's remedy lies with Judge Rosales, not with this court.
