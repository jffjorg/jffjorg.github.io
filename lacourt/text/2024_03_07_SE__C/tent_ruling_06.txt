Defendant MESA VERDE CONVALESCENT HOSPITAL, INC. (“Defendant”) specially
and generally demurs to each cause of action. 
 
On January 18, 2024, this matter was CONTINUED to March 7, 2024 due to
Defendant’s failure to comply with CCP §430.41.
The
Court’s March 7, 2024 Order states: “Defendant MESA VERDE CONVALESCENT HOSPITAL, INC. is ORDERED to
comply with CCP §430.41. If, after complying with CCP §430.41, court
intervention is needed, the parties may appear and argue the merits on the
continued hearing date. If the parties are unable to informally resolve the
issues raised in the instant Demurrer, then the Demurring Defendant must submit
a signed declaration indicating such efforts pursuant to CCP §430.41. The
declaration must be e-filed by no later than Monday, February 26, 2024.” 
As
of March 4, 2024, no declaration in compliance with CCP §430.41 or this Court’s
March 7, 2024 Order have been filed. The matter is placed OFF-CALENDAR due to
Defendant’s failure to comply with CCP §430.41.
