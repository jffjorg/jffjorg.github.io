And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling grants the Motion to Compel Arbitration filed by Tesla Motors, Inc. (Defendant) against Jeanne Cashaw Pierce (Plaintiff). The dispute arises from a complaint filed by the Plaintiff alleging various statutory violations for alleged vehicle defects in a 2018 Tesla Model X purchased from the Defendant. The Defendant filed a Motion to Compel Arbitration, arguing that the arbitration provision in the Order Agreement between the parties is enforceable and that the claims in the Plaintiff's Complaint are covered by the arbitration agreement.

The Court finds that the Arbitration Agreement applies to any dispute between the parties and that the claims in the Plaintiff's Complaint fall under the scope of the arbitration agreement. The Court further finds that the Plaintiff failed to opt out of the arbitration provision in the Order Agreement. As a result, the Court grants the Motion to Compel Arbitration and orders the parties to arbitrate the dispute in accordance with the American Arbitration Association (AAA) rules.
