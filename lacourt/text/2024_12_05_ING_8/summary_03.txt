Significant Statements:

  - "Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified where there is a willful discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and evidence showing that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery rules."
  - "Terminating sanctions should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Defendant's motion for terminating sanctions, but granted monetary sanctions against the Plaintiff in the amount of $1,000. The Plaintiff failed to comply with a court order to provide discovery responses, and the Defendant had requested terminating sanctions as a result. However, the judge found that the circumstances did not warrant imposing terminating sanctions at this time, as the Plaintiff is currently unrepresented and has only failed to comply with one court order. Instead, the judge imposed monetary sanctions against the Plaintiff for failing to comply with discovery obligations and the court's order. The Plaintiff must pay the $1,000 sanction on or before January 9, 2025, or face further consequences.
