And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District, has filed a motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication. The defendant argues that it is immune from liability for the alleged sexual assaults committed by Poe, a school employee, during a school-sponsored trip to Europe. The defendant relies on Education Code section 44808, which provides immunity to school districts and employees unless they have undertaken to provide transportation, sponsored an activity, or otherwise assumed responsibility for the pupil.

The plaintiff, Jane Doe #1, et al., alleges that Poe committed sexual assaults during school-sponsored activities, including the Europe trip. The plaintiff argues that the defendant is not entitled to summary judgment because there are triable issues of fact regarding the defendant's alleged immunity.

The court finds that the defendant's reliance on LeRoy v. Yarboi (2021) 71 Cal.App.5th 737 is misplaced as to Jane Doe #1, #2, and #4, as the alleged sexual assaults occurred on campus, during school hours, and were not solely off-campus. The court also finds that the defendant has not carried its burden in proving its immunity under Evidence Code section 44808.

The court denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment as to all Jane Doe plaintiffs, as to each cause of action, because the defendant has not proven its immunity under Education Code section 44808 and the plaintiff's evidence raises triable issues of fact.
