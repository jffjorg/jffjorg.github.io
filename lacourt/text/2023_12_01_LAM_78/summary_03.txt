Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is in favor of the defendants' motion to compel arbitration. The court finds that an arbitration agreement exists between the plaintiff and EWB Bank, and that the agreement is not unconscionable. The court also finds that the arbitration agreement applies to non-signatories, including EWB Bancorp, Inc. and Renee Chang. The ruling is based on the language of the arbitration agreement, which provides that both employees and EWB would be bound by the agreement if the employee commences or continues employment. The court also finds that the agreement provides for a fair and reasonable process for resolving disputes. The motion to compel arbitration is therefore granted.
