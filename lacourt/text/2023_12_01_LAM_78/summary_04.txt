Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by the defendants. The settlement agreement between the defendants and the plaintiffs includes a release of all claims against the defendants in exchange for $50,000. The judge finds that the proposed settlement is within the ballpark of the defendants' proportionate liability based on the information currently available. The parties reached settlement in good faith after mediation. The judge also finds that the settlement agreement includes a release of all claims against the defendants, which reduces the claims against the other defendants in the amount stipulated by the settlement. The application for determination of good faith settlement is granted.
