And here is a summary in English text:

Judge Jill Feeney's tentative ruling grants Defendant Top of the Mark Homeowners Association, Inc.'s motion to strike punitive damages allegations from the Third Amended Complaint. The complaint alleges that Defendant failed to remedy a burst pipe that caused water damage to Plaintiffs' unit, and failed to disburse insurance funds to Plaintiffs. The Court finds that Defendant's conduct, while negligent and reckless, does not rise to a level of despicable conduct sufficient to support a demand for punitive damages. The Court also denies Plaintiffs' request for leave to amend the complaint. This is the second time the Court has granted a motion to strike punitive damages allegations, and Plaintiffs do not present new facts to allege.
