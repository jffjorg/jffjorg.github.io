And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment in this unlawful detainer case. The plaintiff, AHST 257 LLC, sought summary judgment based on the defendant, Saeid Esmaeilzadeh's, failure to pay rent and holdover damages. The defendant argued that the notice to pay or quit overstated the amount of unpaid rent by 31 percent due to unaccounted payments. The court found that a triable issue of material fact remains and therefore denied the motion. The case will proceed to trial.
