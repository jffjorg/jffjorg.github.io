  Case Number:  21STCV42681    Hearing Date:   January 9, 2025    Dept:  74 De Rosales
v. General Motors, LLC
Defendant General Motors’ Motion for
Summary Judgment 
 
BACKGROUND  
            This
motion arises from a Song-Beverly complaint.
            Plaintiff
Graciela Calderon de Rosales (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against defendant
General Motors (Defendant) alleging a defective product. 
            On
June 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed the Second Amended Complaint (SAC).  Plaintiff alleged six causes of action: (1)
Violation of Civil Code section 1793.2(d); (2) Violation of Civil Code section
1793.2(b); (3) Violation of Civil Code section 1793.2(a)(3); (4) Breach of
Express Written Warranty; (5) Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability;
and (6) Fraud by Omission.
            On
January 31, 2024, Defendant filed a Motion for Summary Judgment of all
Plaintiff’s causes of action. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
            Summary judgment
 or adjudication shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there
 is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
 entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)  Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party
 opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor
 of that party.”  (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384,
  389.)
 
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
The
court sustains Plaintiff’s evidentiary objections.  Ordinarily, percipient witnesses, not
attorneys, provide evidence. Defendant’s counsel fails to lay the foundation
for his personal knowledge that permits him to attest to the authenticity of
any his client’s documents offered in support of Defendant’s motion. Accordingly,
Defendant fails to establish the admissibility of Defendant’s evidence. Because
Defendant fails to present evidence that would allow the Court to grant the
Motion for Summary Judgment, the Court denies the motion.  (See Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850-51.)
CONCLUSION
The
Court denies Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment.  
Defendant
to give notice.
