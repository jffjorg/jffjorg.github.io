And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling continues the Plaintiff's Ex Parte Motion to Seal Exhibit Numbers 13, 22, and 23 attached to the previously filed declaration of John Gomez in support of the Plaintiff's opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment. The Plaintiff must file a supplemental brief of no more than five pages describing a basis for sealing the identified documents.

The judge also continues the Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment or Summary Adjudication, pending the provision of revised separate statements and exhibits for review. The parties must provide revised statements and exhibits, and the Defendants must provide a transcript of any audio recordings on which they rely, authenticated by an employee of the Culver City Police Department.
