And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has conditionally granted the plaintiff's motion to file a second amended complaint, allowing the addition of Los Angeles Surrogacy as a defendant. The court finds that allowing the amendment is proper, despite some procedural errors in the motion. The court concludes that the addition of the new defendant will not prejudice the other side and will not unduly delay the trial. The plaintiff must file the second amended complaint within 10 days of the entry of this order.
