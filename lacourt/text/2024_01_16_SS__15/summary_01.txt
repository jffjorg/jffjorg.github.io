And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on several motions in limine filed by the parties. The judge grants plaintiff's motion to exclude evidence of insurance coverage and payments, except for evidence of actual amounts paid for medical bills. The judge also denies plaintiff's motion to exclude evidence of David Cargill's other health conditions, finding that the evidence could be relevant to life expectancy and damages.

The judge grants defendant's motion to exclude evidence of incidents where people died or were injured as a result of Union Carbide's chemicals other than asbestos, finding that the evidence is irrelevant and would be unduly time consuming.

The judge denies several of plaintiff's motions to exclude evidence, including evidence of family history of cancer, genetics, and references to the Don't Blow It video and an EPA document. The judge finds that the evidence may be relevant and admissible at trial, and that objections can be made at that time.

The judge grants defendant's motion to bifurcate punitive damages.
