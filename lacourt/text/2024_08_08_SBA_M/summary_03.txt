Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted Terracotta Credit Reit LLC's motion to compel a reference pursuant to the written agreements between the parties. The agreements provide for a referee to hear and determine any controversy arising out of or relating to the agreements. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants defaulted on loan agreements, triggering their obligation under the Commercial Guaranty agreements. The defendants oppose the motion, arguing that Loren Cohen is not a party to the agreements, that the reference provision does not apply to the causes of action for intentional and negligent misrepresentation, and that the "one-action rule" is violated. The judge finds that the plaintiff has met its burden to establish the existence of a reference provision and that the controversy should be heard by a referee.
