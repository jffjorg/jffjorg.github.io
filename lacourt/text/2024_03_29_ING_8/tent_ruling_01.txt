I. BACKGROUND¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿¿ 
¿¿
On November 3, 2022,
Plaintiff, Maurice Stephenson (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against
Defendants, Leo Ramsey, Federal and State Income Tax Services, LLC, and DOES 1
through 50. The Complaint alleges causes of action for: (1) Breach
of Oral Contract; (2) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (3) Breach of the Implied
Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (4) Intentional Misrepresentation; (5)
Intentional Misrepresentation; (6) Unjust Enrichment; (7) Negligence; (8)
Declaratory Relief; and (9) Unfair Business Practices in Violation of Business
and Professions Code § 17200, et seq.
 
Per
the moving papers, on August 28, 2023, Plaintiff served his second set of
Requests for Production of Documents on Defendant, Leo Ramsey (“Ramsey”).
Plaintiff notes that responses were due on October 5, 2023. Plaintiff further
asserts that on September 21, 2023, Defense Counsel emailed Plaintiff’s counsel
to request an extension of time until October 30, 2023. Plaintiff contends that
on November 10, 2023 and October 25, 2023, that Plaintiff’s counsel did not
receive any communication from Defendant’s counsel requesting an extension to
respond to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two. After not
receiving any responses, Plaintiff’s counsel contends he contacted Defense
counsel via letter on December 29, 2023 to inquire about the missing responses.
However, since then, Plaintiff contends that no communications have been had
from Defense Counsel regarding the failure to serve any responses or production
to those outstanding discovery requests. As such, Plaintiff now brings this motion to compel initial
responses to discovery. 
¿ 
B. Procedural¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
On February 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed this
motion to compel. On March 18, 2024, counsel for Defendant filed a declaration
in response. On March 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply brief.   
 
¿II.
ANALYSIS¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A.   
Motion
to Compel 
 
Where there has been no timely response to a Code
of Civil Procedure § 2031.010 demand, the demanding party must seek an order
compelling a response. (CCP § 2031.300.) Failure to timely respond waives all
objections, including privilege and work product. Thus, unless the party to
whom the demand was directed obtains relief from waiver, he or she cannot raise
objections to the documents demanded. There is no deadline for a motion to
compel responses. Likewise, for failure to respond, the moving party need not
attempt to resolve the matter outside court before filing the motion. Where the
motion seeks only a response to the inspection demand, no showing of "good
cause" is required. 
B.    
Discussion
 
Here, Plaintiff asserts that he served a second
round of document discovery on Defendant but never received any responses.
Typically, this would be grounds for this motion to order code-compliant,
verified responses without objections. However, on March 18, 2024, Defendant’s
counsel filed a declaration noting that he would be filing a Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel, and requesting this Court CONTINUE this motion in order to
allow time for Defendants to find counsel, and to hear the Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel prior to ruling on this motion. On March 19, 2024, Defense Counsel
filed his motion to be relieved as counsel, which is set to be heard on April
18, 2024. In Plaintiff’s reply brief, Plaintiff notes that Plaintiff has no
objection to and will not be opposing Defense Counsel’s motions, but requested
this Court hear the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel the day of the current
hearing on this motion, March 29, 2024. While understandable, the problem with
Plaintiff’s request is that defendant has already noticed the withdrawal motion
for the April 18 date, and advancing the hearing on that motion for three weeks
without notice or agreement of the Plaintiff himself would be a Due Process
issue.  
 
Here, the Court notes that because there is a Motion
for Defense Counsel to be relieved, that the Court is inclined to CONTINUE this
Motion to Compel to the April 18 date. Defense counsel may present oral
argument on why he should not be sanctioned for failure to communicate with
Plaintiff’s counsel when not submitting responses by the agreed upon due date.
Depending on Defense Counsel’s responses, the Court will address the issue of
sanctions on the April 18, 2024 hearing date. 
 
 
 
 
III. CONCLUSION¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿ 
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendant,
Leo Ramsey’s Response to Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two is
CONTINUED to April 18, 2024. 
 
Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice.
