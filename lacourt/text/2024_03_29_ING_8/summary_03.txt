**Significant Statements**
```
"The critical inquiry when a plaintiff demurs to an answer is whether the answer raises a defense to plaintiff's stated cause of action."
"It is almost inconceivable that a bodily injury case could implicate 38 distinct affirmative defenses or that a trial would raise so many affirmative defenses..."
"The Court is confused as to how Plaintiff believes it met and conferred in good faith with defense counsel."
"Plaintiff's counsel may be confused as well..."
```

**Summary**
The judge has tentatively ruled that the Plaintiff's Demurrer to Defendants' Answer is continued to May 1, 2024, to enable a sufficient meet and confer process. The judge has ordered the parties to meet and confer in good faith and provide a joint status report of what affirmative defenses are still at issue. The judge has also ordered the parties to file their joint status report, or take the demurrer off calendar based on an agreement to file an amended Answer on or before April 26, 2024.
