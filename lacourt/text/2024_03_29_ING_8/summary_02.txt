Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion for terminating sanctions filed by the plaintiffs, Giuseppe Sanzone and Caroline Petersen, against FCA US LLC. The plaintiffs are seeking to strike out the defendant's answer and render judgment by default against the defendant due to the defendant's failure to comply with discovery requests and pay monetary sanctions. The judge has reviewed the facts and legal arguments presented by the parties and is tentatively ruling that the motion for terminating sanctions is denied. However, the judge is granting monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,500 to be paid by the defendant or its counsel to the plaintiffs' counsel on or before April 19, 2024. The judge notes that the defendant's failure to comply with discovery requests and pay monetary sanctions is not enough to warrant terminating sanctions at this stage, but the judge is warning the defendant that future instances of non-compliance may result in more severe sanctions.
