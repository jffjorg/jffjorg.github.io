And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Motion to Compel Arbitration filed by Defendant Milender White Construction, Inc. The ruling states that the payement dispute between the parties should be resolved through arbitration, as per the arbitration clause in their subcontractor agreement. The Judge disagrees with Plaintiff Saddleback Roofing, Inc.'s argument that non-contracting parties cannot be forced into arbitration, and notes that the case does not involve non-signatory parties. The Judge also finds that there is no risk of inconsistent judgments, as the liability of the surety on the bond will only be considered after the determination of liability on the first three causes of action has been made. The Court orders the parties to give notice of the tentative ruling and to proceed with arbitration.
