 Case Number:  22STCV16651    Hearing Date:   February 8, 2024    Dept:  30 STANLEY ATKINS vs AUNDRA SPENCERTENTATIVEThe motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff, Stanley Atkins, is DENIED.Counsel for Plaintiff’s counsel has submitted all of the mandatory judicial council forms (i.e., MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053). However, the hearing dates listed on the proposed order are outdated. Further, the trial date is in April, and it is unlikely that Plaintiff will have sufficient time to obtain new representation in time prior to the trial date if counsel is given time to correct the order. For the foregoing reasons, the motion is denied. Moving party is ordered to give notice.
