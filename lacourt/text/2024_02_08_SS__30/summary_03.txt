And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the motion for a good faith settlement determination filed by the plaintiff and the City of Hawaiian Gardens. The City has filed a joint declaration with its attorney, which sets forth a brief background of the case, including the settlement negotiations and the terms of the settlement agreement. The settlement was reached after 8 hours of mediation and was contingent upon a judicial determination of good faith settlement.

The court finds that the City has met its initial burden to show that the settlement was made in good faith. The City's settlement amount of $117,500 is reasonable, considering the plaintiff's known damages of around $70,000 at the time of settlement. The court notes that there is no requirement to present evidence of financial condition or insurance limits, as held in recent authority.

The plaintiff, Zaragosa, argues that the City has failed to show that the settlement was a good faith settlement. However, the court finds that Zaragosa has failed to meet its burden to establish that the settlement was not made in good faith. Zaragosa's arguments are based on speculation and lack of evidence. The court finds that the settlement was made in good faith and grants the City's motion.
