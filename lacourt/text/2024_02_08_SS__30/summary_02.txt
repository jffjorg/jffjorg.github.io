And here is the summary in English text:

The Court notes that the Plaintiff, CINDY OSORIO, et al., is seeking a continuance due to ongoing medical treatment. The Court allows only one more continuance, citing the age of the case (over three years old) and the fact that the defaulted defendant, DENNIS CASTILLO, et al., is the only remaining party. The Court also identifies several defects in the Plaintiff's request for court judgment, including:

* The Statement of Damages served on the Defendant must be filed with the Court
* The demand for $5,000,000 is unclear (is it for general damages or the total demand?)
* There is no evidence to support the amount sought in special damages ($21,000)
* Does 1-50 has not been dismissed
* There is no proposed judgment filed

Given these defects, the Court allows one last continuance. The Court also orders the Plaintiff to give notice of this ruling and file and serve all paperwork at least five days before the next hearing.
