And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the petitions filed by Plaintiff/Guardian ad Litem Jeanette Martinez for approval of a compromise and settlement of the case. The compromise involves a gross settlement amount of $295,000.00, with payments to each of the four plaintiffs. The Court finds that the compromise is generally reasonable and that the applicable procedures have been followed.

The Court grants the petition with the change that no attorney's fees or costs will be deducted from the amounts awarded to the minors. The funds will be deposited in blocked accounts until the minors reach 18 years old, at which point they can withdraw the principal and interest without a court order.

The Court orders Plaintiff/Guardian ad Litem to deliver a certified or filed copy of this Order to the manager at the financial institution where the funds are to be deposited, and to promptly file a receipt from the financial institution, acknowledging receipt of both the funds deposited and the order for deposit of funds.
