English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration. The Defendant seeks to compel arbitration based on an arbitration provision in the purchase agreement between the Plaintiff and the dealer. The Defendant argues that equitable estoppel applies because the signatory's claims against a nonsignatory arise out of the underlying contract and the nonsignatory's conduct is intertwined with a signatory's conduct. However, the Judge finds that equitable estoppel does not apply because the Plaintiff's warranty-based claims do not rely on and are not inextricably intertwined with the subject purchase agreement.

The Judge also rejects the Defendant's argument that it is a third-party beneficiary who can enforce arbitration. The Judge finds that the subject arbitration provision only mentions third-parties when describing the types of claims which are to be arbitrated, and that the Defendant is not listed in the group of individuals/entities who must arbitrate.

The Judge grants the Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Further Responses, but narrows the requests to exclude documents pertaining to individual vehicles other than the subject vehicle. The Defendant must provide generalized, compiled, aggregate, or summarized information that pertains to other vehicles within 30 days.
