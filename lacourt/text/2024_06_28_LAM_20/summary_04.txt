And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to set aside a default judgment entered against defendants Sidney Sungchul Sohn, Alexander Tsao, and Venerable-Counselors At Law, PC. The motion was filed under California Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b) and (d), which allow a court to set aside a judgment due to improper service or excusable neglect. The defendants claim they were never served with the complaint/first amended complaint and that they believed the case would be dismissed due to a settlement of the underlying personal injury suit. However, the court finds that the defendants' evidence fails to establish improper service, and their conduct in not filing a responsive pleading and not checking the docket to confirm the dismissal is unreasonable and inexcusable. The court is inclined to deny the motion, but will hear further argument.
