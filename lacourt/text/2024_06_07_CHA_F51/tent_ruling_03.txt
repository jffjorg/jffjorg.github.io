BACKGROUND¿ 
 
Plaintiff brings
this action against Defendant under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act
(Civil Code § 1790 et seq.) for a vehicle he purchased on 12/2/20, and for
which Defendant issued the manufacturer’s warranty. (Compl. ¶¶ 4, 8.)
 
On 7/6/22,
Plaintiff filed his complaint, alleging against Defendant the following causes
of action: (1) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty;
(2) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty; and (3)
Violation of the Song-Beverly Act Section 1793.2(b). On 8/5/22, Defendant filed
its answer.
 
On 9/5/23,
this Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to compel the deposition of Defendant’s
Person(s) Most Knowledgeable (“PMK”) and Custodian of Records. On 11/21/23, Plaintiff
filed the instant motion. On 4/10/24, Defendant filed its opposition thereto.
On 5/28/24, Plaintiff filed his reply.

ANALYSIS
 
The Court may
issue terminating or monetary sanctions, upon noticed motion, “against anyone
engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2023.030.) However, “A trial court must be cautious when imposing a
terminating sanction because the sanction eliminates a party’s fundamental
right to a trial, thus implicating due process rights. … Although in extreme
cases a court has the authority to order a terminating sanction as a first
measure … a terminating sanction should generally not be imposed until the
court has attempted less severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful
and/or the record clearly shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez
v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246
Cal.App.4th 566, 604 [internal citations omitted].)
 
Here, Plaintiff
argues that terminating and monetary sanctions are warranted against Defendant because
“GM did not produce,
and still has not produced, its PMK witness” despite the Court’s 9/5/23 Order
to do so. (Pl.’s Mot. 3:5–6.)
 
A.   
Terminating Sanctions
 
Plaintiff
contends that Defendant should be sanctioned for violating the Court’s 9/5/23
Order by failing to produce its PMK for deposition on or before 10/5/23.
(9/5/23 Min. Order.) However, as Defendant notes in opposition, Defendant has
since agreed to produce its PMK witness for deposition on 4/30/24. (Def.’s Opp.
3:7–9.) On reply, Plaintiff confirms that the deposition of Defendant’s PMK
took place on 4/30/24, but maintains that “at the deposition GM did not produce
a witness for all Matters
of Examination as ordered by the Court. … GM did not produce a witness for
Matter of Examination Nos. 2, 7, 8, and 9. … Also, … GM did not produce
documents responsive to Request for Production Nos. 1-14 or 18 -23.” (Pl.’s
Reply 1:27–2:6.)
 
The Court
therefore finds that Defendant has engaged in the misuse of the discovery
process by failing to produce its PMK witness for deposition as ordered by the
Court on 9/5/23. However, the Court declines to issue terminating sanctions
against Defendant for this misuse of the discovery process, as it finds that
Defendant’s actions do not rise to the level of misconduct warranting
terminating sanctions. Although Defendant eventually complied with the Court’s
Order, its compliance was late and insufficient. The Court’s previous Order
stated that Defendant “is ordered to produce its Person(s) Most Knowledgeable
and Custodian of Records to be deposed, and to produce the documents
specified in the deposition notice, on or before 10/5/23.” (9/5/23 Min.
Order, p. 1 [emphasis added].)[1]
 
Based on
the foregoing, the Court orders Defendant to produce its PMK for an additional
deposition on Matters of Examination Nos. 2 and 7–9, and to produce documents
responsive to Requests for Production Nos. 1–14 and 18–23, in full compliance
of Plaintiff’s 9/21/22 Deposition Notice, within 30 days. (Ex. B to Decl. of
Sepehr Daghighian.)

B.    
Monetary Sanctions
 
“The
court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay
the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030, subd. (a).) Here, Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions in the total amount
of $1,500.00 to be imposed on Defendant for Defendant’s violation of the
Court’s 9/5/23 Order. Based the foregoing, the Court
finds it reasonable to impose monetary sanctions against Defendant and/or its
counsel in the amount of $1,500.00.
 
CONCLUSION¿ 
 
The motion is granted in
part. The Court orders Defendant to produce its PMK for an additional
deposition on Matters of Examination Nos. 2 and 7–9, and to produce documents
responsive to Requests for Production Nos. 1–14 and 18–23, as specified in
Plaintiff’s 9/21/22 Deposition Notice, within 30 days. The Court also imposes $1,500.00 in monetary sanctions
against Defendant and its counsel, to be paid within 45 days
