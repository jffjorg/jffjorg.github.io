Court Clerk to give Notice. 
 
The Court will review and consider the untimely Opposition
filed by Defendant GUADALUPE CORONA on October 2, 2023. 
 
This action for partition of real property was filed by
Plaintiffs VANESSA LEAL and RAUL GOMEZ (“Cross-Defendants”) on October 4, 2021.
On January 6, 2023, Defendant/Cross-Complainant GUADALUPE MARIA CORONA
(“Cross-Complainant”) filed the subject Second Amended Cross-Complaint (“SAXC”).


The SAXC alleges, in pertinent part: “CORONA is part owner of the property
located at 14447 Placid Dr, Whittier, CA 90604 (the ‘Subject Property’).” (SAXC
¶6.) “LEAL and GOMEZ moved into the property in 2016, following the death of
LEAL’s mother, CORONA’s daughter. [¶] CORONA had sympathy for LEAL, as LEAL
professed that she had nowhere to go following her mother’s death. [¶] CORONA
and LEAL entered into an oral agreement providing that CORONA and LEAL would
both live at the Subject Property together and CORONA would put LEAL, and LEAL
alone, on the deed to the property in exchange for LEAL providing care for
CORONA when she needed care. CORONA was eighty-one years at the time of the
transaction.” (SAXC ¶¶8-10.) Cross-Complainant alleges that Cross-Defendants
began to “mistreat” Cross-Complainant after the quitclaim deed to the Subject
Property was signed in 2017. (see SAXC ¶¶12-20.)  
 
The SAXC asserts the following
causes of action: (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Elder Abuse; (3) Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress; (4) Assault; (5) Battery; and (6) Promissory
Fraud. 
 
Cross-Defendants demur to the
first, second, third, and sixth causes of action. 
 
Cross-Complainant passed away on
May 7, 2022. 
 
The Demurrer to the First Amended
Cross-Complaint was sustained with leave to amend in order to give the parties
a chance to comply with the requirements of  CCP §377.32. Except as otherwise provided by
statute, a cause of action for or against a person is not lost by reason of the
person’s death, but survives to the applicable limitations period. (CCP
§377.20.) A cause of action that survives the decedent’s death may be commenced
by the decedent’s personal representative. (CCP §377.30.) If no representative
has been appointed, suit may be commenced by the decedent’s “successors in
interest.” (CCP §377.30.) Under CCP §377.32(a), “[t]he person who seeks to
commence an action or proceeding or to continue a pending action or proceeding
as the decedent’s successor in interest under this article, shall execute and
file an affidavit or declaration under penalty or perjury….”  
 
On October 4, 2022, the Amended
Declaration of Laura Corona Re: Appointment of Successor-in-Interest (signed
under penalty of perjury) was filed. The Amended Declaration complies with the
mandatory requirements of CCP §377.32.
 
However, there is currently no
named cross-complainant with standing to prosecute this action. Following the
death of a party, any legal action by that party may only proceed upon
substitution of the decedent’s personal representative or successor in interest
in their place. (CCP §377.31.) “On motion after the death of a person
who commenced an action or proceeding, the court shall allow a pending action
or proceeding that does not abate to be continued by the decedent’s personal
representative or, if none, by the decedent’s successor in interest.” (emphasis
added.) (Id.)  On September 13, 2023,
Laura Corona’s Motion to be Deemed Successor Interest under CCP §377.31 was
filed.  However, this Motion is not set
to be heard until March 12, 2024. 
 
In the interests of judicial
efficiency, this matter is CONTINUED, and the Court ADVANCES the Motion to be
Deemed Successor in Interest as follows: 
 
The demurrer and motion to strike
are CONTINUED to Thursday, December 7, 2023 at 10:30 a.m. in
Dept. SE-C.  On the Court’s
own motion, the Motion of Laura Corona to be Deemed Successor in Interest is ADVANCED
from March 12, 2024 to this date and CONTINUED to Thursday, December
7, 2023 at 10:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C. Opposition and Reply papers may be
filed and served per Code in accordance with the new hearing date.
