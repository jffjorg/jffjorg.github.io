I.       
Defendants
CHLB, LLC; and COLLEGE HEALTH ENTERPRISES, LLC’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s
Further Responses to Request for Admissions (set two) Nos. 90-161 is DENIED.
 
   
II.       
Defendants
CHLB, LLC; and COLLEGE HEALTH ENTERPRISES, LLC’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s
Further Responses to Form Interrogatories (set two) No. 17.1 is DENIED. 
 
Moving
Party to give Notice. 
 
Plaintiff’s
Complaint alleges that on April 23, 2020, Plaintiff was admitted to College
Medical Center following a WIC §5150 hold. Plaintiff was unconscious. When
Plaintiff woke up the next day, April 24, 2020, he was disoriented and
repeatedly asked two orderlies where he was. Plaintiff alleges the two
orderlies shoved Plaintiff, and repeatedly punched Plaintiff’s face and body.
Plaintiff has a history of manic depression. (Complaint ¶¶12-13.) Plaintiff
alleges significant mental suffering and emotional distress because of the
abuse. (Complaint ¶26.) 
 
Further
Responses to Request for Admissions (set two) Nos. 90-161
 
Defendants
move to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to RFA Nos. 90-161, arguing that
further responses are warranted because Plaintiff alleges he was the victim of
assault and battery on April 24, 2020. However, at a deposition conducted on
December 2, 2022, Plaintiff testified that he believed the subject incident
actually occurred on April 22, 2020. Based on this deposition testimony,
Defendants argue that Plaintiff should unequivocally admit that the subject
incident occurred on April 22, 2020. 
 
In
Opposition, Plaintiff argues that further responses are not warranted because
Plaintiff has answered to the best of his ability, based on his recollection of
the subject incident.  Plaintiff responds
that he had limited sleep for several days and he was given medication that put
him to sleep.  The next thing he knew, he
was at a different facility with no memory of when or how he was transported
there and no idea how long he was unconscious for.  After waking up on his first day at College
Hospital, he was unaware of where he was. 

 
A party may
move to compel further responses to RFAs on the grounds that the answers are
evasive or incomplete. (CCP §2033.290(a).) If a timely motion to compel further
responses has been filed, the burden is on the responding party to justify any
objection or failure to fully respond. (Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.) “(a) Each answer in a response to requests for
admission shall be as complete and straightforward as the information
reasonably available to the responding party permits. (b) Each answer shall:
(1) Admit so much of the matter involved in the request as is true, either as
expressed in the request itself or as reasonably and clearly qualified by the
responding party. (2) Deny so much of the matter involved in the request as is
untrue. (3) Specify so much of the matter involved in the request as to the
truth of which the responding party lacks sufficient information or knowledge.”
(CCP §2033.220.)
 
The
court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently complied with the requirements of
CCP §2033.220.  The court recognizes that
an unequivocal response is not always possible. 
In the court’s view, requiring Plaintiff to provide a date certain under
these circumstances would tend to distort, rather than promote, the truth-seeking
function of the discovery process. 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.
 
 
Further
Responses to Form Interrogatories (set two) No. 17.1
 
Form
Interrogatory No. 17.1 is directly related to whether further responses are
warranted as to the RFAs above. Since the Motion to Compel Further Response to
RFA (set two) is DENIED, this Motion is likewise DENIED. 
 
Sanctions
are not requested.
