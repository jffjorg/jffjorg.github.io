And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the Defendant's demurrer to the Plaintiff's Complaint is sustained with 10 days leave to amend. The demurrer was filed to the first, second, third, fourth, and sixth causes of action. The judge has found that the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act does not apply to used vehicles sold with a balance remaining on the manufacturer's express warranty, citing persuasive authority from Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC. The judge has also distinguished the binding authority of Jensen v. BMW of North America, Inc. and has ruled that the demurrer is properly sustained as to the first through fourth causes of action.

The judge has also ruled that the demurrer to the sixth cause of action, which alleges a violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, is sustained with 10 days leave to amend. The judge has cited relevant case law, including Daugherty v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc., to support their ruling.
