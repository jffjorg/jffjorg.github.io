And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of SENIOR OPERATIONS LLC v. CERTIFIED RECORDS MANAGEMENT, LLC, granting the plaintiff's application for a writ of possession. The writ is granted because the plaintiff has established a probable claim to possession of its business records, which are allegedly wrongfully withheld by the defendant. The defendant has failed to provide evidence of notice of rate changes, as required by the 2003 contract, and has refused to return the records despite payment of all outstanding storage fees. The Court will determine the amount of the bond required to secure the writ at the upcoming hearing.
