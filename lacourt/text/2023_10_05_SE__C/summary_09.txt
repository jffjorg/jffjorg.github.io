Significant Statements:
  - "An amended pleading supersedes the original one, which ceases to perform any function as a pleading."

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively ruled that the Special Motion to Strike the Cross-Complaint is continued to December 21, 2023, at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C. The defendant/cross-complainant is ordered to give notice. The court has considered the parties' arguments and has determined that the amended cross-complaint does not substantively change any factual allegations and was likely filed to avoid a ruling on the anti-SLAPP motion. As a result, the court will proceed to analyze the motion as directed towards the original cross-complaint. The court has also granted the cross-complainant's request for a continuance due to untimely service of the anti-SLAPP motion. The court permits supplemental briefing and sets a new hearing date.
