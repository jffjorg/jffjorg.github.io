And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling dismissing the plaintiff's complaint for quiet title without leave to amend. The defendant, Martha Morales, had filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that it failed to support a cause of action under CCP §430.10(e) and was fatally uncertain. The court did not address the merits of the defendant's arguments, but instead focused on the fact that the complaint was unverified, which is a threshold requirement for a quiet title action under CCP §761.020. Since the complaint was not verified, the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.
