Defendant MARTHA MORALES’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint
is SUSTAINED without leave to amend. 
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
No Opposition filed as of October 2, 2023. 
 
This action for quiet title was filed by Plaintiff ARMIDA
CARDENAS (“Plaintiff”) on January 17, 2023. 
 
Defendant MARTHA MORALES (“Defendant”) argues that
Plaintiff’s quiet title claim fails to support a cause of action under CCP
§430.10(e), and that the Complaint is fatally uncertain. 
 
Without
reaching the merits of the arguments raised by Defendant in the subject
Demurrer, the Court notes that the Complaint is unverified. A complaint for
quiet title must be verified. (CCP §761.020.) This is a threshold requirement.
On this basis, the unopposed demurrer is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
