```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to compel further responses to the plaintiff's requests for admissions and form interrogatories. The motion was based on the plaintiff's alleged assault and battery on April 24, 2020, and the defendants' argument that the plaintiff should unequivocally admit that the incident occurred on April 22, 2020, based on the plaintiff's deposition testimony. However, the judge found that the plaintiff has sufficiently complied with the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure Section 2033.220, and that requiring the plaintiff to provide a specific date under these circumstances would distort the truth-seeking function of the discovery process. As a result, the motion is denied.
