```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Defendant's Demurrer to the Plaintiff's Complaint and Motion to Strike Punitive Damages are "off-calendar as moot" due to the Plaintiff's timely filing of a First Amended Complaint on September 21, 2023. The hearing on the Demurrer and Motion to Strike, previously set for October 5, 2023, is no longer necessary. The Judge is ordering the Plaintiff to give notice of this ruling. The ruling is based on California Civil Procedure Code (CCP) §472, which allows a party to amend its pleading without leave of court, and CCP §1005(b), which sets deadlines for filing oppositions to demurrers and motions to strike.
