Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The dispute arises from Plaintiff C CERNIAZ's purchase of a 2018 Honda Odyssey vehicle, which was allegedly defective and failed to be repaired. Defendant seeks to compel arbitration under the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) and its accompanying arbitration agreement. However, the judge finds that the Arbitration Agreement is valid and covers the controversy or controversies in the parties' dispute. The judge also rules that equitable estoppel does not apply to compel plaintiffs to arbitrate their claims because plaintiffs were not making use of the terms of the sale contracts. Furthermore, the judge holds that Defendant may not compel arbitration because Plaintiff's claims arise from Defendant's statutory obligation and are not based on any express contractual language.
