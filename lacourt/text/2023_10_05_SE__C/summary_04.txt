And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Good Shepherd Bible Church's motion to quash service of summons. The church claims it is not a named party in the lawsuit, but the judge finds that the requirements of the statute have been met. The plaintiff satisfied the requirements for service upon Doe Defendants by submitting the certificates of merit for the court's ex parte review. The judge notes that a plaintiff need not be named a defendant in a complaint under subdivision (m) in order to effect service. Therefore, the service of process upon Good Shepherd Bible Church is valid. The certificates of merit filed in this action shall remain under seal until further order of the court.
