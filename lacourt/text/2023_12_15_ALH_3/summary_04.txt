And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a default prove-up hearing in the case of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (Plaintiff) vs. Bo Chen (Defendant). The Plaintiff seeks a default judgment against the Defendant, which includes attorneys' fees in the amount of $1,850. However, the Declaration of Ray Diamond appears to contradict this, stating that the Plaintiff is waiving its claim for fees and costs. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to address this discrepancy and, if necessary, submit revised forms before the Court enters judgment. The tentative ruling also notes that parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the Court, and that the opposing party may still appear at the hearing to argue the matter.
