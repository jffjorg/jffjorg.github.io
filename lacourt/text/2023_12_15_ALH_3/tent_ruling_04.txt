[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: DEFAULT PROVE-UP HEARING

          Plaintiff JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
(“Plaintiff”) seeks a default judgment against defendant Bo Chen (“Defendant”).
The amount of judgment requested on Forms CIV-100 and JUD-100 includes
attorneys’ fees in the amount of $1,850. This contradicts the Declaration of
Ray Diamond in which Plaintiff appears to be “waiving it’s [sic] claim for fees
and costs in connection to the default.” (Diamond Decl., ¶ 6.) Plaintiff is
ordered to address this discrepancy and – if necessary – submit revised forms before
the Court enters judgment. 
Dated
this 15th
day of December, 2023
