The judge has granted Defendant Huntington Memorial Hospital's motion to compel responses to discovery requests, also known as Requests for Production of Documents (Set One).

The judge has ordered Plaintiff to serve verified responses without objections to Defendant's requests within 10 days of the date of the order. The order is based on California Code of Civil Procedure Section 2031.300, which allows the court to compel responses when a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests.
