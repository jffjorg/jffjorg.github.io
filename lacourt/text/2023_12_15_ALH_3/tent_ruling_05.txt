On May 1, 2023,
plaintiff Lala Hovhannisyan (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against defendant Huntington Memorial Hospital (“Defendant”) (erroneously
sued as “Huntington Hospital”) arising from medical
 services provided on June 1, 2022. 
On August 10, 2023, Defendant
served Requests for Production of Documents (Set One) on Plaintiff.  No responses were received.  On October 2,
 2023, defense counsel sent a letter requesting responses by October
 13, 2023. Defendant did not receive Plaintiff’s responses and
Plaintiff did not request an extension of time to serve them. Accordingly,
Defendant filed this motion on November 2, 2023.  
Where a party fails to serve timely
responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling
responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.)
Plaintiff
did not oppose the motion and it is undisputed responses to Defendant’s
Requests for Production of Documents (Set One) were not served.  Defendant’s
motion is GRANTED and Plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses
without objections to Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents (Set
One) within 10 days of the date of this Order. 
Moving party to give notice.
Dated
this 15th
day of December 2023
