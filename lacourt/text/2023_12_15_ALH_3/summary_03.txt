And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's application for default judgment. The plaintiff, U.S. Bank Trust National Association, filed an action against the defendants, S & H Hospital Pharmacies, Inc., Pension Funds, and S & H Hospital Pharmacies Incorporated Pension and Profit Sharing Fund, seeking to cancel an instrument and obtain declaratory relief. The plaintiff alleges that the loans secured by the Prior Deeds of Trust were fully paid and/or satisfied, but the lien was not reconveyed or released by a title insurance company, causing a cloud on title to the property. The court has found that the plaintiff's evidence supports the allegation that the loans were paid off and the Prior Deeds of Trust should be cancelled to place the plaintiff in the first priority lien position. The court has also granted the plaintiff declaratory relief, declaring that the Prior Deeds of Trust are of no further force and effect and that any interest held by the defendants or their successors and assigns is subject to the plaintiff's beneficial interest.
