And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by Defendant Sean Lee. The case involves the death of Jose Zaldivar, who was working on the Subject Premises, a frozen desserts factory owned by non-party Sweety Novelty, Inc. The Plaintiffs, Elva Zaldivar, Stephanie Zaldivar, and Marina Zaldivar, allege that Defendant Sean Lee owed a duty of care to Jose Zaldivar and that his breach of that duty caused Jose's death.

The judge notes that Defendant Sean Lee did not inspect or evaluate the forklift and metal safety cage used by Jose Zaldivar, and that he did not own or control the Subject Premises. However, the judge concludes that Defendant Sean Lee's declaration and deposition testimony raise triable issues of fact regarding the extent of his control over Sweety's business and the Subject Premises.

The judge also addresses the Privette doctrine and Labor Code section 3607, which may bar the Plaintiffs' claims. The judge concludes that the Privette doctrine does not apply because Sweety was Jose Zaldivar's statutory employer, and that Defendant Sean Lee failed to meet his burden to show that Woods was an independent contractor for Sweety.

The judge denies the motion for summary judgment and grants the motion for summary adjudication as to the first cause of action. The judge denies the motion for summary adjudication as to the second and third causes of action.
