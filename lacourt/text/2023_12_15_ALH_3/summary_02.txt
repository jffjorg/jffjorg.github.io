**Significant Statements**
```
- "In the absence of a voluntary submission to the authority of the court, compliance with the statutes governing service of process is essential to establish that court's personal jurisdiction over a defendant....

(Dill v. Berquist Construction Co.)
- "Before allowing a plaintiff to resort to service by publication, the courts necessarily require him to show exhaustive attempts to locate the defendant, for it is generally recognized that service by publication rarely results in actual notice." (Watts v. Crawford)

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to quash service of summons. The motion was filed by the defendant, Lee Siu Fung, Siegfried, who argues that the plaintiff, Alan Chang Wah Tang and Hou Chung Man, did not use reasonable diligence to locate him before attempting service by publication. The Judge has denied the motion and has concluded that the plaintiff exercised reasonable diligence to locate and serve the defendant.

The Judge has found that the plaintiff made several attempts to serve the defendant, including mailing the summons to his address at Edgehill Place and personally serving him through the Sheriff's Department. The Judge has also found that the plaintiff's counsel had received information from two separate sources that forwarding was unavailable, which was sufficient to establish that the plaintiff had used reasonable diligence to locate the defendant.

The Judge has also rejected the defendant's argument that the plaintiff should have called the businesses associated with the defendant to exhaust all possible addresses that he could have been served at. The Judge has concluded that the documentation about these businesses only reflected the defendant's address at Edgehill Place, and therefore, a phone call would not have made any difference.

The Judge has therefore denied the motion to quash service of summons and has ordered that the case proceed with the service by publication.
