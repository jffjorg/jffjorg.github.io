Background 
            Erick
Zavala (Zavala/Plaintiff) filed suit on November 2, 2023 against Defendants
Miner, Ltd.; Miner GC, Limited Partnership; Miner GP, LLC; and Onpoint Group
LLC (collectively, Defendants) for several labor law violations. The operative
First Amended Complaint (FAC) was filed on June 4, 2024, and alleges the
following: 
 
            Defendants are
in the business of installing, repairing and servicing loading docks and
electrical retracting doors at commercial facilities and warehouses. (FAC, ¶
12.) Plaintiff began working for Defendants in May of 2022 as a service
technician, whose job duties involved traveling to facilities to install,
repair, and maintain electrical doors. (Id. at ¶ 13.) On February 13,
2023, Plaintiff was involved in an automobile accident that resulted in serious
injuries. (Id. at ¶ 17.) Plaintiff received medical treatment and
physical therapy for his injuries, moreover Plaintiff’s physician emailed
Plaintiff’s supervisor and manager requesting that Plaintiff be placed on light
duty from home. (Id. at ¶ 17.) For the next several months Plaintiff
worked from home. On May 12, 2023 Plaintiff received a letter from Defendants
informing him his employment had been terminated effective May 5, 2023. ((Id.
at ¶ 23.)
 
            Throughout
his employ, Plaintiff alleges multiple statutory violations including failure
to provide meal periods, failure to provide overtime compensation, and failure
to provide accurate wage statements. The FAC pleads fifteen causes of action:
 
1.    
Nonpayment of Overtime Compensation (Lab. Code, §§ 510,
1194);
2.    
Failure to Provide Off-Duty Meal Periods (Lab. Code, §§
226.7, 512);
3.    
Failure to Provide Off-Duty Rest Periods (Lab. Code, §
226.7);
4.    
Failure to Furnish Accurate, Itemized Wage Statements
(Lab. Code, §§ 226, 226.3);
5.    
Waiting-Time Penalties for Nonpayment of Wages (Lab.
Code, §§ 201, 203, 218);
6.    
Disgorgement of Profits (Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200
et seq.)
7.    
Discrimination in Violation of FEHA (Gov. Code, §§
12940(a), (m)(2); 12941);
8.    
Failure to Accommodate in Violation of FEHA (Gov. Code,
§ 12940(m));
9.    
Failure to Engage in Interactive Process in Violation
of FEHA (Gov. Code, § 12940(n));
10.  Retaliation
in Violation of FEHA (Gov. Code, § 12940(h));
11.  Failure
to Prevent/Remedy Discrimination, Harassment, and/or Retaliation in Violation
of FEHA (Gov. Code, § 12940(k));
12.  Violation
of CFRA Rights (Gov. Code, § 12945.2(a), (q));
13.  Retaliation
in Violation of CFRA (Gov. Code, § 12945.2(k));
14.  Whistleblower
Retaliation (Lab. Code, § 1102.5 et seq.); and
15.  Wrongful
Termination in Violation of Public Policy 
    
 
            The motion
now before the Court is Defendants demurrer and motion to strike. Defendants
demur to causes of action seven through fifteen. Plaintiff opposes the
demurrer, but not the motion to strike. Defendants file a reply to the
opposition to the demurrer, and a notice of non-opposition to the motion to
strike.     
 
Meet and Confer
 
            “Before
filing a demurrer…the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by
telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for
the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would
resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc.
§430.41(a); see also Code Civ. Proc. §435.5 (imposing similar requirements for
a motion to strike).) Defendants provide the Declaration of Shane Bekian which
states that the parties participated in extensive meet and confer efforts from
January 17, 2024 until May of 2024. Although the parties were unable to resolve
the issue, the requirements of both Code Civ. Proc. §§430.41(a) and 435.5 have
been met. The Court now turns its attention to the demurrer and motion to
strike. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Demurrer 
 
Legal Standard
 
            “[A]
demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235
Cal.App.4th 385, 388.) A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that
appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the
pleading that are judicially noticeable. (See Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in
ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not
subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their
contents].) For purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a
complaint are assumed to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the
truth of conclusions of law. (Aubry v.
Tri-City Hosp. Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
 
Analysis
 
            Upon
demurrer, Defendants contend that causes of action seven through fifteen fail
to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. The Court agrees and
sustains the demurrer. 
 
A.   
Causes of Action 7-13
 
            The seventh
through the thirteenth causes of action all rely on whether the FAC sufficiently
alleges discrimination in violation of FEHA. The elements of a disability
discrimination claim under FEHA are: (1) that plaintiff suffered from a
disability, (2) plaintiff could perform the essential duties of the job with or
without reasonable accommodations, and (3) plaintiff was subjected to an
adverse employment action because of the disability. (Glynn v. Superior
Court (2019) 42 Cal.App.5th 47, 53, (“Glynn”.)) 
 
Defendants contend the FAC fails to
draw a nexus between Plaintiff’s physical disability and his termination.
(Dem., 11:16-18.) Plaintiff responds that the FAC explicitly alleges Defendants
wrongfully discriminated against him by denying Plaintiff work opportunities,
interfered with his job duties, and terminated his employment. (Opp Papers,
2:8-11.) However, detail about how the discrimination took place is lacking.
For example, in Glynn the court reversed summary judgment on appeal
because it was found that although there was no animosity against Glynn with
regard to his disability, there was an erroneous belief about his physical
condition which triggered Glynn’s termination. (Glynn, supra, at 53-54.)
Similarly, in Wallace v. County of Stanislaus (2016) 245
Cal.App.4th 109, the plaintiff there was able to demonstrate they
were forced to take unpaid leave because of their knee injury (Wallace, supra,
118-119 and 129.) Here, Plaintiff presents the basic facts that Plaintiff
was injured in a car accident, was then able to work from home, and then was
subsequently terminated. Without more detail as to the discrimination suffered
by Plaintiff, the Court finds no nexus between Plaintiff’s injury, and the
subsequent termination. With no nexus the discrimination claim fails, as does
all related claims. Therefore, the demurrer is sustained, with leave to amend,
as to causes of action seven through thirteen.                     
 
B.   
14th Cause of Action: Whistleblower
Retaliation  
 
            Labor Code section
1102.5 provides whistleblowers protection from employer retaliation. (People
ex rel. Garcia-Brower v. Kolla’s, Inc. (2023) 14 Cal.5th 719,
722, internal citation omitted.). Section 1102.5 was amended in 2013 with the
following italicized language: “"[A]n employer, or any person acting on
behalf of the employer, shall not retaliate against an employee…” 
 
            Upon
demurrer, Defendants contend the only time Plaintiff alleged he informed
Defendants of their violations of federal and state law was after his
termination. (See FAC, ¶ 27.) Defendants argue this cannot be the basis of a
cause of action under section 1102.5 as a matter of law. Defendants are
correct, as the adverse treatment had already occurred. Nowhere in the FAC,
does Plaintiff allege that he engaged in protected activity prior to
termination. Therefore, the demurrer is sustained as to the fourteenth cause of
action.  
 
C.   
15th Cause of Action: Wrongful
Termination in Violation of Public Policy
 
            “The elements of a claim for wrongful
discharge in violation of public policy are (1) an employer-employee
relationship, (2) the employer terminated the plaintiff’s employment, (3) the
termination was substantially motivated by a violation of public policy, and
(4) the discharge caused the plaintiff harm. It is well established that a
termination premised on an employee’s refusal to violate either a statute or an
administrative regulation may support a claim for wrongful termination in
violation of public policy.” (Nosal-Tabor
v. Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center (2015) 239 Cal.App.4th 1224, 1234,
citation omitted.)
 
            In the FAC,
Plaintiff alleges the termination based on his disability was the violation of
public policy here. However, as aforementioned, the FAC fails to provide
sufficient facts to allege discrimination. Therefore, the fifteenth cause of
action also falls to demurrer. 
 
 
            Motion to
Strike
 
Legal Standard
 
            The court
may, upon motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems
proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any
pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (a).) The court may also strike all or
any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this
state, a court rule, or an order of the court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd.
(b).) The grounds for a motion to strike are that the pleading has irrelevant,
false, or improper matter, or has not been drawn or filed in conformity with
laws. The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading
or by way of judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437.)
 
            A motion to strike any pleading must
be filed “within the time allowed to respond to a pleading”—e.g., 30 days after
service of the complaint or cross-complaint unless extended by court order or
stipulation. [CCP § 435(b)(1)]. This does not affect the court's power to
strike sua sponte. Courts are specifically authorized to strike a pleading upon
a motion or at any time in the court's discretion. (CCP § 436.) The Court
notes that motions to strike punitive damages may be granted, where the alleged
facts do not support conclusions of malice, fraud or oppression. (Turman v.
Turning Point of Central Calif., Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.)
 
 
Analysis
            As
each cause of action that requests punitive damages has been successfully
demurred to, the motion to strike is denied as moot. 
 
            Leave to
Amend
            Leave to
amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349 [court shall not “sustain a demurrer without leave to
amend if there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment”]. As there is reasonable possibility of successful amendment, the
Court shall grant 20 days leave to amend. 
 
 
Conclusion
            Accordingly,
Defendants’ demurrer is sustained in its entirety. The motion to strike
is denied as moot. Plaintiff is granted leave to amend. Plaintiff shall
file and serve his amended complaint on or before September 4, 2024.
