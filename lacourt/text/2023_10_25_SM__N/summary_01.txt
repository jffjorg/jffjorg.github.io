And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by BLANKSPACES, LLC to the First Amended Complaint of 1448 Second Street, LLC. The Court has reviewed the pleadings and the lease attached to the complaint. The demurrer is based on the argument that the leasehold charges under the lease are not just the base monthly rate but also include all monetary obligations due under the lease, including insurance charges. The Court finds that the lease does state that "Rent" includes all monetary obligations of Lessee to Lessor under the terms of the lease, and that the Notice to Pay Rent or Quit attached to the complaint seeks a total of $353,268, which includes the base rent plus insurance. The Court also notes that the lease provides that the rent due for the option term is the determination of the fair market rent per rentable square foot after assessment. The Court concludes that the Plaintiff has stated a viable claim for unlawful detainer, and therefore overrules the demurrer. The Defendant is ordered to file and serve an answer to the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint within five days of entry of this order.
