And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by Ford Motor Company to the 2nd cause of action for fraudulent inducement-concealment is sustained without leave to amend. The court found that the plaintiffs failed to plead with sufficient particularity what representations Ford made to them regarding the transmission defect and did not plead that Ford made any specific representations directly to them. The court also found that the plaintiffs do not allege any direct contact with Ford before purchasing the vehicle where representations regarding the transmission defect could have been revealed. Additionally, the court ruled that the economic loss rule bars the plaintiffs' fraud claim, as the claim is based on an alleged fraudulent omission rather than an affirmative misrepresentation and seeks purely economic losses.
