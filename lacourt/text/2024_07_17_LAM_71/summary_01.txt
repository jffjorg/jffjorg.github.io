And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to a motion filed by Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (Defendant) to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Markella Thanou and Non-Party Witness Amalia Thanou. The Judge grants the motion and orders Plaintiff Markella Thanou to appear for deposition and produce documents within 10 days of the ruling. The Judge also grants the motion to compel the deposition of Amalia Thanou and orders her to appear for deposition and produce documents within 10 days of the ruling. Additionally, the Judge awards sanctions of $2,230.00 to the Defendant against Plaintiff Markella Thanou and her counsel, Kingsely Opia Enwemuche, jointly and severally.

The Judge's ruling is based on the fact that Plaintiff's counsel failed to produce Plaintiff and Amalia for deposition despite being properly served with deposition notices. The Judge finds that Defendant's counsel made reasonable efforts to resolve the issues informally and that Plaintiff's counsel's failure to produce Plaintiff and Amalia was unreasonable.
