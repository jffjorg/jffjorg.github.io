Plaintiff
Carlos Felix (“Felix”) (“Plaintiff”) moves unopposed for this Court to vacate
the dismissal entered on May 21, 2018, and enter judgment pursuant to the terms
of the Stipulated Judgment executed between Plaintiff and Defendant Jose Somarriba (“Somarriba”) (“Defendant”) in April
2018.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 1.)
 
Background
          On June 21, 2017, Plaintiff filed the
instant action against Defendant seeking damages for breach of contract and
common counts.  The parties settled
pursuant to a Settlement Agreement and Stipulated Judgment executed on April
16, 2018, and a request for dismissal was filed on May 21, 2018, which provided
for monthly payments of $500, with a balloon payment to conclude the
matter.  (Decl. of Ciaccio ¶¶3-4, Exhs. A,
B.)  The Settlement Agreement, Stipulated
Judgment, and Request for Dismissal indicated this Court would retain
jurisdiction pursuant to C.C.P. §664.6.  (Decl. of Ciaccio ¶4, Exh. B.)  
Defendant
made payments pursuant to the settlement agreement until June 2023, when he
began making payments which were returned for insufficient funds and in July
2023 he stopped making payments altogether.  (Decl. of Felix ¶1.)  
On
February 23, 2024, a demand was made on Defendant to bring his account current
or otherwise judgment would be entered in the amount of $90,000 pursuant to the
Settlement Agreement and Stipulated Judgment without offset payments received.  (Decl. of Ciaccio ¶7, Exh. D.)  Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement,
Defendant was given 10 days to cure the default, which he has failed to do.  (See Decl. of Ciaccio ¶¶3, 7, Exhs. A,
D.)
Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on May 16, 2024. 
As of the date of this hearing no opposition has been filed.
 
Motion to Enforce Settlement
          C.C.P. §664.6 provides, as follows: “If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.”
Plaintiff submitted evidence
Plaintiff and Defendant entered into the Settlement Agreement,
which was signed by both parties on April 16, 2018, and provided for this Court
to retain jurisdiction pursuant to C.C.P. §664.6.  (Decl. of Ciaccio ¶3, Exh. A.)  Pursuant to the terms
of the Settlement Agreement, 
In the event that
either (a) the past due Deferred Payment is not paid within the ten (10) business
day Cure Period, or (b) FELIX has to resort to the Notice Procedure on three
(3) or more occasions by virtue of three (3) or more Defaults, then an “Uncured
Default” shall exist and FELIX shall be entitled to file the stipulation to
entry of judgment in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the “Stipulation to
Entry of Judgment”), and to enter judgment in the form attached as Exhibit B
(the “Judgment”), in accordance with the terms of the Stipulation for Judgment
set forth below in paragraph 4 of this Agreement.  
 
(Decl. of Ciaccio ¶3,
Exh. A at §3.)
Defendant failed to cure his
default during the ten-day cure period; no payment has been received as of
March 11, 2024.  (Decl. of Ciaccio ¶7.)  
Accordingly, the request for
dismissal entered by this Court on May 21, 2018, is vacated. Plaintiff is
entitled to an order entering the Stipulated Judgment in the amount of $90,000.00
against Defendant, with credit for any sums paid to Plaintiff pursuant to the
Settlement Agreement dated April 16, 2018. 
Based on the foregoing,
Plaintiff’s unopposed motion to vacate the entry of dismissal entered by
this Court on May 21, 2018, and enter the Stipulated Judgment executed by
parties on April 16, 2018, is granted.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
unopposed motion
to vacate the entry of dismissal entered by this Court on May 21, 2018, and enter
the Stipulated Judgment executed by parties on April 16, 2018, is granted.
Plaintiff is entitled to an
order entering Judgment against Defendant in the amount of $90,00.000 with
credit for any sums paid to Plaintiff pursuant to the Settlement Agreement
dated April 16, 2018.  This Court retains
jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to C.C.P. §664.6.  
Moving Party to give notice.
