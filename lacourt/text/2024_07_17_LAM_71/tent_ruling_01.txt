Defendant’s counsel declares that on June 11, 2024, his office

deposition; Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond.  (Decl. of Moulin ¶16.)  Defendant’s counsel declares that on June 12,

(Decl. of Moulin ¶17.)

indicated by email that neither Plaintiff nor Non-party witness Amalia would

On June 11, 2024, Defendant’s counsel’s office emailed Plaintiff’s

          Discussion
C.C.P. §2025.280(a) provides, in part,
“[t]he service of deposition notice under Section 2025.240 is effective to
require any deponent who is a party to the action . . . to attend and to
testify, as well as to produce any document or tangible thing for inspection
and copying.”  (C.C.P. §2025.280(a).)
C.C.P. §2025.450 states, in pertinent
part, as follows:
(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action . . .
, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to
appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any
document, . . . described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice
may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and
the production for inspection of any document, . . .  described in the deposition notice.
 
(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the production for inspection of any document . . . described in the
deposition notice.
 
(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition
and produce the documents . . . described in the deposition notice, by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.
 
(C.C.P. §2025.450.)
          The
Court grants Defendant’s motion pursuant to C.C.P. §2025.450 and orders
Plaintiff to appear
for deposition and produce documents and things within ten (10) days of this
Court’s ruling.  Plaintiff was properly served with four
deposition notices and failed to appear for the properly noticed depositions.
          Accordingly,
Defendant’s unopposed motion is granted.
 
Sanctions
C.C.P. §2025.450(g) provides, in part:
If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 . . . in favor of the party who noticed the deposition
and against the deponent . . . unless the court finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(C.C.P. §2025.450(g)(1).)
          Defendant’s
request for sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel, Kingsely Opia
Enwemuche, is granted.  The Court
calculates sanctions in the amount of $2,230.00 as follows:
(3 hours x $200/hour) + $60 filing fee + $1,570.00 court
reporter fees for Plaintiff’s failure to appear at deposition on June 13, 2024,
and July 5, 2024 = $2,230.00
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s unopposed motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff
is granted.  Plaintiff is to appear for
deposition with 10 days of this ruling.
Defendant’s request for sanctions against Plaintiff and
her counsel Kingsely Opia Enwemuche, jointly and severally, is granted in the
amount of $2,230.00.  Sanctions are
payable within 20 days of this ruling.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling. 
 
2.     Motion to
Compel- Amalia
Meet
and Confer
A
motion to compel a deposition must be accompanied by a declaration stating
facts showing “a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of
each issue presented by the motion.”  (C.C.P.
§§2016.040, 2025.480(b).)
Defendant’s
counsel declares that his office served Plaintiff’s counsel with Notice of
Testimony and Records Deposition of Amalia (“Notice”) by email on April 25,
2024.  (Decl. of Moulin ¶11.)  Defendant’s counsel declares the Notice set
the deposition for June 14, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., via Zoom.  (Decl. of Moulin ¶11, Exh. A.)  Defense counsel sent a letter with the Notice
indicating its understanding that Plaintiff’s counsel would represent Amalia, a
non-party witness, at deposition.  (Decl.
of Moulin ¶11.)  Defendant’s counsel
declares Plaintiff’s counsel never served objections to the deposition nor did
Plaintiff’s counsel advise Defendant’s counsel that he did not represent
Amalia, that he would not produce Amalia for deposition, or that Defendant
would have to subpoena Amalia for deposition. 
(Decl. of Moulin ¶12.)  
Defendant’s
counsel declares that on June 11, 2024, his office emailed Plaintiff’s counsel
the Zoom information for Amalia’s June 14, 2024, deposition and asked that
plaintiff’s counsel to confirm Amalia would appear for deposition; Plaintiff’s
counsel did not respond.  (Decl. of

12, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel indicated by email that neither Plaintiff nor
Non-party witness Amalia would appear for deposition.  (Decl. of Moulin ¶18.)  Plaintiff’s counsel indicated that he was in
trial in Van Nuys and unavailable, and he agreed to produce Amalia for
deposition on June 25, 2024.  (Decl. of
Moulin ¶18.)
Defendant’s
counsel declares that on June 25, 2024, Defendant’s counsel appeared via Zoom
for Amalia’s deposition.  (Supp.-Decl. of
Moulin ¶5.)  Amalia did not have video
access on her phone, stated that she was sick, and could not walk 30 meters to
a computer in her home to access the Zoom deposition.  (Supp.-Decl. of Moulin ¶5.)  The deposition was continued because Amalia
could not appear via videoconference.  (Supp.-Decl.
of Moulin ¶5, Exh. B.)
Plaintiff’s
counsel agreed to make Amalia available for deposition on June 28, 2024.  (Supp.-Decl. of Moulin ¶7.)
At
approximately 8:12 a.m. on June 28, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Defendant’s
counsel that Amalia would not be able to appear for deposition because of “her
health.”  (Supp.-Decl. of Moulin ¶8, Exh.
D.)  To date, Plaintiff’s counsel has not
produced Amalia for deposition and has not provided another date for her
deposition.  (Supp.-Decl. of Moulin ¶11.)  
Defendant’s
counsel’s declaration substantially complies with the requirements of C.C.P. §2016.040.

 
Background
Defendant’s counsel served plaintiff’s counsel with
Notice of Plaintiff’s Deposition and Request for Production of Documents
(“Notice”) on April 11, 2024. The Notice required that Plaintiff present for
deposition via Zoom on June 13, 2024.  Plaintiff’s

request a different date until defense counsel contacted plaintiff to confirm the
deposition on June 12, 2024.  (Decl. of Moulin ¶12, Exh. A.)  
On June
11, 2024, Defendant’s counsel’s office emailed Plaintiff’s counsel the Zoom
information or Plaintiff’s June 13, 2024, deposition and asked that plaintiff’s
counsel confirm she would appear for deposition; Plaintiff’s counsel did not
respond.  (Decl. of Moulin ¶16.)  On June 12, 2024, Defendant’s counsel emailed
Plaintiff’s counsel to confirm that Plaintiff would appear for deposition as
noticed on June 13, 2024.  (Decl. of
Moulin ¶17.)  On June 12, 2024,
Plaintiff’s counsel indicated by email that neither Plaintiff nor Non-party
witness Amalia would appear for deposition. 
(Decl. of Moulin ¶18.)  Plaintiff’s
counsel indicated that he was in trial in Van Nuys and unavailable, and he agreed
to produce Plaintiff and Amalia for depositions on June 25, 2024, and June 28,
2024, respectively.  (Decl. of Moulin
¶18.)

excusing plaintiff’s non-appearance. 
(Supp.-Decl. of Molin ¶9.)  
Defendant filed the instant motion on June 20,
2024.  As of the date of this hearing no
opposition has been filed.
 
          Discussion

LLC v. Bader (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 123, 127.)
          The
Court grants Defendant’s motion pursuant to C.C.P. §2025.480(b) and orders Amalia
to appear for deposition and produce documents and things within ten
(10) days of this Court’s ruling.  Amalia was properly served with four
