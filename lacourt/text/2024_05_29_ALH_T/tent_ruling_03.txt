Moving
Party:           Defendant/Cross-Complainant
GGP Northridge Fashion Center, LC (erroneously named and served as Brookfield
Properties Retail Group) (“GGP Northridge”)
Responding Party:    None
Tentative
Ruling:       Granted
Background
On
November 30, 2021, Nahid Yazdanparast (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against
Ashley and GGP Northridge for negligence arising from a slip and fall
incident in the parking lot of the Ashley Homestore located at 9301 Tampa Ave.,
Northridge, California.  
On
May 18, 2023, Ashley filed its answer. On May 30, 20223, GGP Northridge
filed its answer. 
On
September 12, 2023, GGP Northridge filed its Cross-Complaint against
Ashley for equitable indemnity, contribution, express indemnity, breach of
contract, and declaratory relief.
On
November 13, 2023, Ashley filed its answer to the Cross-Complaint.
On
January 8, 2024, GGP Northridge filed the instant motion to compel
Ashely’s further discovery responses to requests for admission without
objection. GGP Northridge requests sanctions in connection with the
motion.
No
opposition has been filed as of May 25, 2024.
Motion to Compel Further
Responses to Requests for Admission  
Where responses to requests for admissions
have been timely served but are deemed deficient by the requesting party, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling the responding party’s
further response.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (a).)  For the
Court to have jurisdiction to hear a motion for orders compelling an opponent’s
further responses to discovery, the moving party must have served the motion on
the responding party within 45 days of the moving party’s receipt of the initial
or supplemental responses for which the motion is being brought.  (Id.
at § 2033.289, subd. (c).) 
“The
court shall impose a monetary sanction … against any party, person, or attorney
who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response …
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (d).)  
Discussion
Defendant/Cross-Complainant
GGP Northridge
moves to compel Defendant/Cross-Defendant Ashely’s further discovery responses,
without objection, to request for admission numbers 9 and 25. GGP Northridge
also request monetary sanctions against Ashley and its attorneys in the sum of
$1,811.65.
1.      Timeliness
and Meet and Confer
For the Court to have jurisdiction to hear
GGP Northridge’s motion, GGP Northridge must have filed it without 45 days of
receiving responses from Ashley.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.289, subd. (c).) 
The
motion must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration in compliance with
CCP § 2016.040. (Code Civ. Pro., § 2033.290, subd. (b).)
Here, Ashely served unverified
responses on November 13, 2023 and later served a signed verification on
December 1, 2023. (Declaration of Michael F. Avila ¶ 11; Ex. “B.”) The parties
agreed to extend the deadline to file motions to compel to January 8, 2023. (Id. at ¶ 14; Ex. “E.”) GGP Northridge filed
this motion on January 8, 2023.  The
Court finds the motion is timely and the declaration of counsel satisfies the
meet and confer requirements. 
2.      Requests for Admission 
 RFA
No. 9:
“Admit that on the date of the INCIDENT, 12/22/19,Defendant/ Cross-Complainant,
GGP NORTHRIDGE FASHION CENTER, LP qualified as one of the “Indemnified Parties”
under Section 12.2 of the lease attached hereto as Exhibit “1 (See pages BATES
Numbered GGP-020- GGP-021).”
 RFA
No. 25:
“Admit that Defendant/ Cross-Complainant, GGP NORTHRIDGE FASHION CENTER, LP
qualifies as an additional insured under a commercial general lability policy
issued to Defendant/ Cross-Defendant, ASHLEY FURNITURE INDUSTRIES, LLC and/or
its related entities.”
 Ashley provides the
same response to each request. Specifically, Ashley objects claiming the
requests are vague, ambiguous, and asks the responding party to speculate as to
the meaning of the term “qualified.” Further, the requests seek a legal
conclusion.
 First, the Court finds
that GGP Northridge has shown good cause that the RFAs are relevant to this
action because, per the lease agreement, GGP Northridge claims that Ashley is required
to defend and indemnify GGP Northridge from Plaintiff’s claim and that Ashley
was required to obtain general liability insurance with limits of $5 million
and to name GGP Northridge as an additional insured so that GGP Northridge
would be protected by said insured under claims such as Plaintiff’s claims in
this instant lawsuit. (Avila Decl. ¶¶ 5, 8 12.)
 Second,
the Court finds Ashley’s objections are meritless. The Court finds that the
requests are neither vague nor ambiguous. As written, the requests are
intelligible. Further, the Court finds that Ashley is not required the
speculate as to the meaning of the term “qualified” because the term is used in
it ordinary and plain meaning. Lastly, “a request
[for admission] may ask a party for a legal conclusion.” (Grace v.
Mansourian (2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 523, 529.)  The Court therefore grants the motion and
orders Ashley to provide further responses to these RFAs without objection.
 3.     
Sanctions
 As concerns
motions to compel, the law only requires sanctions in the event that a party
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (d).) As such, any monetary sanctions granted are
within the discretionary power of the Court as per section 2033.290. As per
section 2023.010, subdivision (d), failure to respond constitutes a misuse of
the discovery process. Additionally, it is customary to grant sanctions where a
party has filed a motion to compel, and the other party fails to file an
opposition. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)   
 Here, Ashley has
provided no opposition to the instant motion. GGP Northridge requests sanctions
in the sum of $1,811.65. (Avila Decl. ¶ 15.) The Court awards sanctions in the amount of $936.65. This
amount reflects five hours of attorney work (preparing this motion and
appearing at the hearing) at the reasonable rate of $175.00 per hour, plus the
$61.65 filing fee. This amount does not include the time spent preparing a
reply, as no opposition was filed. The Court finds this amount of sanctions
appropriate to compensate for the cost of the instant motion.
