 Case Number:  21STCV27987    Hearing Date:   May 29, 2024    Dept:  T Motion To Compel Plaintiff’s Second Independent Medical
Examination
Moving Party:                    Defendant Costco Wholesale
Corporation
Responding Party:          Plaintiff
Cynthia Hopes
Tentative Ruling:             Denied
BACKGROUND
On January 30, 2024, the Court granted Costco’s motion to
reopen discovery based on the July 23, 2024 trial date.
On February 23, 2024, Costco initially filed its motion to
compel Plaintiff’s second medical examination, but it was later taken
off-calendar on March 21, 2024 by the Court, with the Honorable Judge Lisa
Jaskol presiding.  
On May 6, 2024, Costco re-noticed its motion to compel
Plaintiff’s second medical examination. On May 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed her
opposition. On May 22, 2024, Costco filed its reply. 
LEGAL STANDARD
In any case in which a plaintiff is seeking recovery for
personal injuries, any defendant may demand one physical examination of the
plaintiff where: (1) the examination does not include any diagnostic test or
procedure that is painful, protracted, or intrusive; and (2) the examination is
conducted at a location within 75 miles of the residence of the examinee. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2032.220 (a).) A defendant may make a demand for physical
examination without leave of the court after that defendant has been served or
has appeared (Code Civ. Proc. § 2032.220 (b)), and the physical examination
demanded shall be scheduled for a date at least 30 days after service (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2032.220 (d)).  
"If any
party desires to obtain discovery by a physical examination other than that
described in Article 2 (commencing with Section 2032.210), or by a mental
examination, the party shall obtain leave of court. (Code of Civ. Proc., §
2032.310(a).) A motion for an examination shall specify the time, place,
manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination, as well as the
identity and specialty, if any, of the person or persons who will perform the
examination, and shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2032.310(b).) The Court shall grant the motion only for good
cause shown.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2032.310(a).)
DISCUSSION
Costco has failed to meet and confer in compliance with Code
of Civil Procedure §§ 20160.040 and 2032.310(b). While Costco’s counsel sent an
email requesting a second medical examination on December 13, 2023 (Breuer
Decl. ¶ 19, Exh. I), there is no indication that the parties actually met and
conferred in good faith. There is no indication that Costco’s counsel attempted
to discuss with Plaintiff’s counsel following receipt of Plaintiff’s objection.
The mere sending of an email or letter does not establish a good faith attempt
to meet and confer. While there may be good cause in compelling a second
medical examination, these procedural defects cannot be overlooked.
Based on the foregoing, the court DENIES Costco’s motion to
compel Plaintiff’s second independent medical examination without
prejudice. 
Plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
