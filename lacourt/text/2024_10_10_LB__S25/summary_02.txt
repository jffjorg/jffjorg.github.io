And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to withdraw as counsel filed by Plaintiff's counsel should be denied due to a lack of proof of service of the motion, declaration, and proposed order on all other parties who have appeared in the case. The court notes that California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires proof of service on all parties before a motion to withdraw can be considered. The judge plans to discuss the potential lack of notice to other parties at the upcoming hearing.
