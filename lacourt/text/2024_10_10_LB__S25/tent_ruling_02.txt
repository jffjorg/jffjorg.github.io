 Case Number:  23LBCV02387    Hearing Date:   October 10, 2024    Dept:  S25 Legal StandardAn attorney in an action may be changed at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon the order of the court, upon the application of either client or attorney, after notice from one to the other. (Code Civ. Proc., § 284, subd. (2)). California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires:1. Notice of motion and motion to be directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel Civil form (MC-051));2. A declaration stating in general terms, and without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney client relationship, why a motion under CCP §284(2), is brought instead of filing a consent under CCP §284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel Civil form (MC-052));3. Service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and4. The proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel Civil form (MC-053)).The motion should be denied if withdrawal would prejudice the client. (Rules Prof. Conduct, Rule 3-700(A)(2); Weil & Brown, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial, 9:385.2 (2008); 1 Witkin Cal. Pro., Attorneys §72 (2008).) The motion should be denied if it will cause undue delay in the proceeding or cause injustice. (Mandell v. Superior Court, (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.) The determination whether to grant or deny an attorney’s motion to withdraw as counsel of record lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, having in mind whether such withdrawal might work an injustice in the handling of the case. (Lempert v. Superior Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173.) A breakdown in the attorney-client relationship (or personality clash) is grounds for withdrawal. (Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.) An attorney is not limited to withdrawing from a case for cause and may withdraw when withdrawal can be accomplished without undue prejudice to the client. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)Tentative RulingPlaintiff’s counsel has not provided proof of service of the motion, the declaration, and the proposed order on all other parties who have appeared in this case. See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d). Potential lack of notice to be discussed at hearing.
