And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to strike or tax costs after trial. The court finds that the plaintiff, David Houck, is the prevailing party under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, as he obtained a prescriptive easement, an injunction, and damages of $11,000. The court awards Houck costs associated with his deposition of Michael Sanders, as this witness provided expert testimony relevant to Houck's requests for an easement. The court also awards Houck costs associated with his mediation fees, subject to court discretion.

However, the court taxes costs associated with certain depositions, including those of Jack Garvey, David Tokushige, Michael Schaaf, and Steve Frankel, as these witnesses did not provide relevant testimony. The court also taxes costs associated with mediation fees incurred before the action began.

The court reduces the total cost award to $20,196.84, which includes the taxed costs and the costs awarded to Houck. The court grants the defendant's motion to tax costs in part and denies it in part.
