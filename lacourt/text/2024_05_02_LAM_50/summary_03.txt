And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a cross-complaint filed by Caltrans against the City of Burbank. Caltrans alleges that the City's vacation of the Subject Property constitutes an adverse claim against the State's rights to and on the Subject Property. The court notes that the City cites Government Code section 65009, subdivision (c), which provides that certain actions must be commenced and served on the legislative body within 90 days. The court does not see how this case is relevant to the City's Exhibit 7. Caltrans also alleges that the State is informed and believes that the Relinquishment reserved to the State certain property rights, including the rights of ingress and egress. The court is not convinced by the City's argument that the statute of limitations would have run six years ago, i.e. 2018.
