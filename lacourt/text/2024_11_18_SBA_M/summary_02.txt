And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Errica Herring's petition for relief from the claims filing statute. The petition was filed on July 5, 2024, and an amended petition was filed on August 7, 2024. The petition claims that Herring's failure to file a timely claim was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. However, the judge found that Herring failed to present any competent evidence to support her claim and that the failure to file a timely claim was due to her own negligence. The judge also noted that Herring's claim of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect was not supported by any facts and that she failed to exercise reasonable diligence in investigating and pursuing her claim. The judge relied on various California court cases to support her decision, including Hearn v. Howard, Department of Water & Power v. Superior Court, and N.G. v. County of San Diego.
