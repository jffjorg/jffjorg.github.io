And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Honorable Gary Y. Tanaka, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ronette Roebke v. Nusuri Ahmed, et al. (Case Number: 24TRCV00427). The case is an action for residential unlawful detainer, and the defendant's counsel, Madeline B. Liebreich, has filed a motion to be relieved as counsel. The motion is denied without prejudice because counsel failed to demonstrate that she served the notice, declaration, and proposed order on all parties, including the client. The Judge finds that the attorney has filed the required declaration and has shown sufficient reasons for withdrawal, but the motion is denied due to the lack of proof of service. The Judge orders Counsel to give notice of the Court's ruling.
