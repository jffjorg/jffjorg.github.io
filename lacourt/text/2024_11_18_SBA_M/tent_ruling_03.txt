PROCEEDINGS
 
            Ronette Roebke v. Nusuri Ahmed, et al.
            24TRCV00427
1.      Madeline
B. Liebreich’s, Counsel for Defendant Nusuri Ahmed, Motion to be Relieved as Counsel 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Madeline B. Liebreich’s, Counsel for Defendant Nusuri
Ahmed is denied without prejudice. 
 
            Background
 
Plaintiff filed the Complaint on February 6, 2024.
This is an action for residential unlawful detainer.   
 
Motion to be Relieved
as Counsel
 
Counsel
states, in the declaration, valid reasons for withdrawal. Counsel states that there
has been a breakdown in communication. The Court finds that the attorney has
filed the required declaration.  The
Court also finds that the attorney has shown sufficient reasons why the motion
to be relieved as counsel should be granted and why the attorney brought a
motion under Code of Civil Procedure § 284(2) instead of filing a consent under
section 284(1). 
 
However, the
motion is denied without prejudice because counsel failed to demonstrate that
she served the notice, declaration, and proposed order on all parties,
including the client.  Therefore, the
motion to be relieved as counsel is denied without prejudice, unless moving
party can demonstrate proof of service of the moving papers. 
 
Madeline B.
Liebreich is ordered to give notice of the Court’s ruling.
