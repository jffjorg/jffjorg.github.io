And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted plaintiff Blake Williams' motion for leave to file a Third Amended Complaint and/or supplemental complaint, in part. The court has struck language from the proposed pleading that alleges further retaliation by the defendants. The motion is granted because the proposed pleading complies with the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324(a) and (b), and the court has found that the amendment is necessary and proper. However, the court has denied the motion to the extent that it sought to introduce new causes of action. The court has also ordered plaintiff to file and serve the proposed Third Amended Complaint within three days of the date of the ruling. The court will confer with the parties regarding the status of the pending motion for summary judgment.
