 Case Number:  23STCV09455    Hearing Date:   December 8, 2023    Dept:  86 SAN MARCOS PHARMACY, INC., ET AL. V. SANTA MARIA
PHARMACY, INC., ET AL.
Case Number: 23STCV09455
Hearing Date: December 8, 2023 
 
[Tentative]       ORDER
DENYING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF ATTACHMENT 
 
 
Plaintiffs, San Marcos Pharmacy, Inc. and
Guadalupe Pharmacy, Inc., move for a pre-judgment writ of attachment against
Defendant, Santa Maria Pharmacy, Inc., in the amount of $1,482,330. 
 
RELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
On April 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint
for breach of contract and other claims.
 
On August 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed this application
for a writ of attachment and notice of hearing.
 
On September 28, 2023, the court entered
Plaintiff’s request for default against Defendant Santa Maria Pharmacy, Inc.
 
Defendant did not file an opposition to the
application. Plaintiff notes Code of Civil Procedure section 484.060,
subdivision (a) provides a defendant who does not file a timely opposition to
an application for a writ of attachment “shall not be permitted to oppose the
issuance of the order.”
 
ANALYSIS 
 
The
Court shall issue a right to attach order if the Court finds all of the
following:
 
(1)   
The claim upon which the attachment is
based is one upon which an attachment may be issued.
(2)   
The plaintiff has established the
probable validity of the claim upon which the attachment is based.
(3)   
The attachment is not sought for a
purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is
based.
(4)   
The amount to be secured by the
attachment is greater than zero. (Code Civ. Proc. § 484.090.)
 
“The
application [for a writ of attachment] shall be supported by an affidavit
showing that the plaintiff on the facts presented would be entitled to a
judgment on the claim upon which the attachment is based.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 484.030.) Statutory attachment procedures are purely creations
of the legislature and as such “are subject to ‘strict construction.’ ” (Hobbs
v. Weiss (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 76, 79 [emphasis added].) A judge does not
have authority to order any attachment that is not provided for by the
attachment statutes. (Jordan-Lyon Productions, Ltd. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp.
(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1459, 1466.) 
 
An
application for the attachment of property is a law and motion matter. (Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1103, subd. (a)(2). A motion “must consist of at least
the following: (1) A notice of hearing on the motion; (2) The motion itself;
and (3) A memorandum in support of the motion or demurrer.” (Id. at Rule
3.112, subd. (a).) The California Rules of Court do not excuse the submission
of a memorandum of points and authorities with an application for a writ of
attachment. (Id. at Rule 3.1114, subd. (a) [motions for which memo not
required].)
 
“A
party filing a motion, except for a motion listed in rule 3.114, must serve and
file a supporting memorandum. The court may construe the absence of a
memorandum as an admission that the motion . . . is not meritorious and cause
for its denial . . . .” (Id. at Rule 3.113, subd. (a).) A memorandum
“must contain a statement of the facts, a concise statement of the law,
evidence and arguments relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases, and
textbooks cited in support of the position advanced.” (Id. at subd.
(b).)
 
Plaintiffs
did not submit any memorandum in support of the motion. The declarations
(properly) contain no statement of the law and contain no legal analysis. The
declarations (properly) do not contain a single legal citation. The declarations
(properly) may not be deemed a memorandum to support the application.[1]
 
Accordingly,
as Plaintiffs have provided no legal analysis of their legal theory (i.e., the
elements of a breach of contract and common counts) through a memorandum, the
court treats the omission as an admission by Plaintiffs that the application is
not meritorious and as the reason for the application’s denial. 
 
The
court has also reviewed the notice and application forms. Like the declarations,
nothing within the forms could be construed as a memorandum. There is no legal
analysis of Plaintiffs’ theory of why/how it is entitled to relief.
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The application is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. IT
IS SO ORDERED.
