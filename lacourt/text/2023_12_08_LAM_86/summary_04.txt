The judge is considering a petition to review the appropriateness of a penalty imposed on a public employee, Petitioner. The Petitioner does not contest the administrative findings, but argues that the penalty is too harsh. The judge notes that the hearing officer did not make a factual finding that Petitioner is/was an alcoholic, despite the County suggesting that the record supports this conclusion. The judge acknowledges that the hearing officer suggested that Petitioner may have suffered from alcoholism, but notes that this was not a formal finding. The judge is considering the appropriateness of the penalty, citing California case law and the hearing officer's proposed decision.
