Summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a Judge denying a petition for writ of mandate filed by Ronald Rodriguez, a former Senior Detention Services Officer with the Los Angeles County Civil Service Commission. The petition was filed to challenge the Commission's decision to uphold Rodriguez's discharge from employment due to misconduct related to a domestic violence incident. The Judge found that the Commission did not abuse its discretion in upholding the discharge, citing the egregious nature of Rodriguez's misconduct, including his prior 15-day suspension for a conviction for driving under the influence and his failure to control his behavior while under the influence of alcohol. The Judge also noted that the Commission's decision was supported by its disciplinary guidelines and the facts of the case.
