And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Mitchell Beckloff, has issued a tentative ruling denying the application for a pre-judgment writ of attachment filed by Plaintiffs San Marcos Pharmacy, Inc. and Guadalupe Pharmacy, Inc. against Defendant Santa Maria Pharmacy, Inc. The application sought to attach $1,482,330 worth of property. The Judge found that the Plaintiffs failed to provide a supporting memorandum in support of their application, as required by California Rules of Court. The Judge also noted that the Plaintiffs did not provide any legal analysis of their legal theory or citations to support their claim. As a result, the Judge treated the omission as an admission by the Plaintiffs that the application is not meritorious and denied the application without prejudice.
