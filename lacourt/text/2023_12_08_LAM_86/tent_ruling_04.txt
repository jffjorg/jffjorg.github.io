[1] As discussed infra, Petitioner does not
contest the administrative findings. The only issue presented by his petition
is the appropriateness of the penalty. (Opening Brief 5:3-5.) Accordingly, as the factual findings are not in issue, the court may
sometimes cite to the hearing officer’s proposed decision when summarizing the
evidence.

[3]
The County is litigating this matter; the Commission
has filed a notice of no beneficial interest in the outcome of the
litigation.  


[4] As the County argues, Petitioner has cited no medical
evidence he is/was an alcoholic.  (Opposition
13, fn. 4.) Further, the hearing officer did not make any formal factual
finding that Petitioner is/was an alcoholic, or that the disease of alcoholism
caused Petitioner to engage in the his driving under the influence conviction or
the domestic violence incident that led to his discipline. (AR 460-462.) Nonetheless,
the court acknowledges the hearing officer suggested in the “Discussion”
section of his decision that Petitioner may have suffered from alcoholism. (AR
458-459.) The County also seems to concede the record supports a conclusion
that “Petitioner is an alcoholic.” (Opposition 4:13.)
