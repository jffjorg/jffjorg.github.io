And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on an Order to Show Cause re Entry of Judgment in the case of Save Our Rural Town v. County of Los Angeles. The dispute centers on whether the court should enter judgment requiring Real Parties in Interest, Doug Gaudi, Joanna Gaudi, Paul Zerounian, and Robert Friedman, to pay Petitioner, Save Our Rural Town, enforcement costs of almost $94,000. The court finds that Petitioner is not a prevailing party under Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (a)(4) because Petitioner did not recover any relief against Real Parties. The court agrees with the arguments made by Real Parties that Petitioner had an enforceable judgment against them as of June 22, 2021, and that Petitioner could obtain no relief against them in this proceeding. The court intends to revise the judgment to specify that Petitioner is the prevailing party as against Respondents only, strike items 5, 6, 7, and 8, and add a new item 5 specifying that Real Parties are the prevailing parties as against Petitioner.
