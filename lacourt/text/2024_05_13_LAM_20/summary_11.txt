And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendants, 7520 S. Broadway, LLC, Haresh Jogani, and J.K. Properties, Inc., have moved to quash the service of summons, alleging that the plaintiffs failed to serve them properly. The plaintiffs, however, have adequately shown that service was rendered at the defendants' business address, and a receptionist was served with the summons and complaint. Additionally, the subject papers were mailed to the same place. The court finds that the service was proper and therefore denies the motions to quash. The defendants are ordered to file an answer within 20 days.
