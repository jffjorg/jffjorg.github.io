  - "Until there is a conflict or disagreement, there is nothing to resolve in litigation."

```

And here is the English summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Court concludes that the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 applies to this case because a dispute first arose when the Plaintiff filed his DFEH complaint in February 2024, which is after the Act's enactment date of March 3, 2022. The Court finds that a dispute did not arise when the Plaintiff was harassed by Gaspar Garcia, as the harassment continued despite the Plaintiff's requests to stop. The Court denies the Motion to Compel Arbitration.
