And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Bruce Stallworth's motion to set aside a default judgment entered against him. Bruce had argued that he was not responsible for not updating his home address, which he claimed was not notified of the default due to his move to a new location in Missouri. However, the judge found that Bruce's new counsel, Ted Khalaf, had waited three months after being appointed to file the motion to set aside default, which was deemed an unjustified delay. The judge concluded that Bruce and his counsel had not shown diligence in seeking relief, and therefore denied the motion.
