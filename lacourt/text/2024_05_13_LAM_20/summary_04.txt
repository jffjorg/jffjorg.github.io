And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling of the judge is that the motion to compel further responses from Pitzer College (Pitzer) is granted in part. The judge denied requests 1-2, 4, and 11 as they are overbroad and not commensurate with the scope of the suit. The judge granted requests 3, 5, and 15, which are relevant to establishing whether the plaintiff's management of funds was inappropriate, punitive damages, and communications about the plaintiff. The judge also granted requests 12-14, which are relevant to establishing whether the plaintiff's requests were mishandled. The judge denied requests 6-7 and 8-10 as the relevance of the documents is not apparent. The judge granted requests 1-8, 10-17, and 19-35 for admission, as the objections lack merit. The judge ordered Pitzer to provide further responses and production within 30 days. The judge also encouraged counsel to appear remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
