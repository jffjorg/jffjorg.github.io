DEFENDANTS TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
The Court considers the moving papers
and opposition.
 
Defendants move to dismiss this action
for lack of prosecution under CCP § 583.410.
Defendants assert that Plaintiff has refused to pay Plaintiff’s share of
arbitration costs, despite being ordered to arbitration by the Court on
November 16, 2021. 
 
The Court declines to dismiss the action on these grounds. Plaintiff represents
that she has been ill, preventing her from participating in the arbitration.
Plaintiff states that she intends to arrange a hearing before the arbitrator
prior to hearing on this motion.
 
Defendants’ motion is DENIED.
