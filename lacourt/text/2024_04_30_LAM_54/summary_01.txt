And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is denied. The court declines to dismiss the action for lack of prosecution, despite Defendants' assertion that Plaintiff has refused to pay arbitration costs. Plaintiff represents that they have been ill and unable to participate in arbitration, and intend to arrange a hearing before the arbitrator prior to the hearing on this motion. The court finds that Plaintiff's illness and intention to participate in arbitration outweigh the Defendants' concerns about lack of prosecution. The motion is denied."
