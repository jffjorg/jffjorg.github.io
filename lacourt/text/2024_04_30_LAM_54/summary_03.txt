And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by Defendant Blue Legacy Construction, Inc. is OVERRULED. The Defendant had argued that the Plaintiff, Safeco Insurance Company of America, failed to allege negligence and that negligence per se is not a cause of action. However, the judge found that the Plaintiff's complaint sufficiently alleged a cause of action for negligence and that the Plaintiff may also plead negligence per se as an alternative theory of liability. The judge has ordered the Defendant to file and serve an answer to the complaint within 20 days of notice of the ruling.
