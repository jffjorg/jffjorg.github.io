  WILSON CHEMICAL COMPANY 
                                          


 Case No.: 
  22STCV29577 
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  December 4, 2024



 
Defendants’ motion to compel further responses is GRANTED.
Plaintiffs are sanctioned, jointly and severally with counsel, $3,500.
 
On 9/12/2022, Plaintiff Thomas D. Perez and Delia Lopez De Perez
initiated tis suit against 31 Defendants, alleging: (1) negligence; (2) strict
liability—failure to warn; (3) strict liability—design defect; (4) fraudulent
concealment; (5) breach of implied warranties; and (6) loss of consortium. 
 
            On 9/4/2024, Defendant R.R. Street
& co. Inc. (Street), on behalf of all Defendants, moved to compel further
responses from Plaintiffs to Defendants’ Joint Requests for Production of
Documents to Perez (Perez Discovery) and Joint Requests for Production of
Documents to Villalobos (Villalobos Discovery).
 
            The motion is unopposed.
 
Discussion

 
            Defendants argue that a Court order
is necessary to compel Plaintiffs to make further responses to Request Nos. 1–6
of the Perez Discovery and Request Nos. 1–2, 4–6, and 8–10 of the Villalobos
Discovery jointly propounded by Defendants to Plaintiffs. 
 
            Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’
responses served on July 16, 2024 are deficient in three respects:
 
-         
For all
requests, Plaintiffs failed to respond with valid objections, an agreement to
comply, or compliance, contravening CCP §§ 2031.210 and 2031.280(a), and thus
“compliance with the demands [are] incomplete” contravening CCP §
2031.310(a)(1) and/or include meritless objections that are “without merit or
too general,” contravening CCP § 2031.310(a)(3). Furthermore, Plaintiffs’
assertions of privilege are not accompanied by a privilege log, contravening
CCP § 2031.240(c)(1).
 
-         
For
other requests, Plaintiffs promised they would “comply with [each] demand by
producing all non-privileged documents,” but in fact produced no documents
whatsoever, contravening CCP § 2030.320(a).
 
-         
For
other requests, Plaintiffs stated that they “already complied” with each
request, but in fact, had not searched for all documents within Mrs.
Villalobos’ possession, custody, or control pertaining to the documents referenced
in her deposition, contravening CCP § 2031.310(a).
 
Defendants represent that despite at least 9 attempts on the part
of Street’s counsel to resolve this matter informally, Plaintiffs never
responded to any of the messages.
 
After review, the Court finds Plaintiffs’ responses to be
deficient. Moreover, Plaintiffs’ failure to oppose this motion in any way is
taken as a concession on the merits. It also indicates that sanctions are
appropriate, as Plaintiffs have offered no justification for their repeated
failure.
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendants’ motion to compel further
responses is granted. Plaintiffs are sanctioned, jointly and severally with
counsel, $3,500. ($350/hr x 10 hr). 
 
It is so
ordered.
