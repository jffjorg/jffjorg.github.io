And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's motion to compel further responses from the Plaintiff regarding documents requested in the discovery phase of the lawsuit. The Plaintiff's responses were deemed deficient by the Court, and the Plaintiff failed to oppose the motion or respond to the Defendant's attempts to resolve the issue informally. As a result, the Plaintiff is sanctioned $3,500, jointly and severally with their counsel. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's failures to respond to the Defendant's requests and to oppose the motion warrant the imposition of sanctions.
