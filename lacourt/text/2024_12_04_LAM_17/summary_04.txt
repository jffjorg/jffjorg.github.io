And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Eric Greene, has filed a motion for sanctions against the plaintiff's attorney, Bozho Deranga, alleging that the attorney intentionally filed the complaint in unlimited jurisdiction to evade the sealing requirement and to harass him. The defendant also claims that the discovery propounded by the plaintiff was burdensome.

The court has denied the motion for sanctions, finding that there is insufficient evidence to support the claims. The court notes that the plaintiff's counsel filed the complaint in unlimited jurisdiction because the potential damages were unknown and could have exceeded the $35,000 threshold for limited jurisdiction. Additionally, the court finds that the decision to file in unlimited jurisdiction was not an intentional effort to evade the sealing requirement, as the record was sealed due to the defendant's request and no money judgment was entered.

Furthermore, the court finds that the discovery propounded by the plaintiff was not burdensome, as the plaintiff was entitled to utilize all available discovery devices authorized by the Civil Discovery Act. The court concludes that the defendant's motion for sanctions is denied based on the lack of sufficient evidence to support the claims.
