Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Billy Jaite's application for default judgment without prejudice. The judge notes several defects in the application, including:

* Unclear oral contract between Billy Jaite and Vanessa Campa
* Lack of information about the terms of the contract and when they were communicated to/by Defendant
* Prayer in the complaint does not seek costs or interest
* Exhibit 1 does not provide information about the recipient of wire transfers or the year of the transfers
* Billy Jaite's statements in paragraphs 6 and 7 are based on "information and belief" and must be supported by evidence
* Billy Jaite fails to provide a declaration from Matthew Albee, a phone forensics specialist, regarding unsuccessful data retrieval efforts

The judge directs Billy Jaite to submit a revised and complete default judgment packet that addresses these issues.
