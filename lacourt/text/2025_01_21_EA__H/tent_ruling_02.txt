 Case Number:  24PSCV02666    Hearing Date:   January 21, 2025    Dept:  H Leonard v. Queen of the Valley, Case No. 24PSCV02666ORDER CONTINUING HEARING ON DEMURRER The hearing on Defendant Emanate Health Medical  Center dba Emanate Health Queen of the Valley Hospital’s Demurrer to  Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint is CONTINUED to February 13, 2025, at  10:00 a.m., to allow Plaintiff to file and serve the document purporting to  constitute the Second Amended Complaint.   I.        Background Plaintiff Lisa Leonard (“Plaintiff”) alleges that  her mother died in connection with receiving poor care at a medical facility. On August 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended  Complaint against Emanate Health Medical Center dba Emanate Health Queen of the  Valley Hospital’s (sued and served as Queen of the Valley) (“Defendant”) and  Does 1-“1 or who company brings.” On October 24, 2024, the Court sustained  Defendant’s demurrer to the First Amended Complaint, with 30 days’ leave to  amend. Pending before the Court is Defendant’s demurrer to  the Second Amended Complaint.   II.      Legal  Standard A demurrer may be made on the grounds that the  pleading, inter alia, does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of  action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).)“A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the  evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects  appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 [citations omitted].) At the pleading  stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the  defendant of the factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) “[A] demurrer does not, however,  admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the  pleading, or the construction placed on an instrument pleaded therein, or facts  impossible in law, or allegations contrary to facts of which a court may take  judicial knowledge.” (S. Shore Land  Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732 [citations  omitted].) “A general demurrer based on the statute of  limitations is only permissible where the dates alleged in the complaint show  that the action is barred by the statute of limitations. The running of the  statute must appear ‘clearly and affirmatively’ from the dates alleged. It is  not sufficient that the complaint might be barred.” (Roman v. County of Los Angeles (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 316, 324 [citation omitted].)   III.     Discussion Defendant demurs, per Code of Civil Procedure  section 430.10, to Plaintiff’s “Second Amended Complaint,” on the basis that it  fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. On October 24, 2024, the Court sustained  Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint, with 30 days’  leave to amend and ordered Defendant’s counsel to give notice. On October 25,  2024, Defendant filed (and served via mail and email) a “Notice of Ruling.” On December 12, 2024, the instant demurrer was  filed; footnote one therein reads as follows: “On October 24, 2024, defendant’s  demurrer to plaintiff’s first amended complaint was heard before Honorable  Allison L. Westfahl Kong. Judge Kong sustained the demurrer and granted  plaintiff 30 days to file a second amended complaint. Since that date, all  plaintiff has filed is a declaration on November 12, 2024. Defendant is  treating the declaration as plaintiff’s second amended complaint. During meet  and confer efforts, plaintiff has not disputed this.” The Court’s docket does not reflect that Plaintiff  filed a declaration on November 12, 2024. On  December 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed a 20-page document consisting of a one-page  “Declaration” Judicial Council Form MC-030, two pages of an “Attached  Declaration” Judicial Council Form MC-031 labeled “page 2 and page 3a,”  respectively, a one-page unsigned document on pleading paper dated “12/18/2024”  labeled “page 1,” a one-page document with the bolded words “For Reply” at the  top left hand corner, a one-page “Attached Declaration” Judicial Council Form  MC-031 labeled “page 4,” a one-page document entitled “Letter of Intent to  Sue,” a one-page document with the bolded words “Leonard v. Emanate—Meet and  Confer re Second Amended Complaint” at the top left hand corner, a one-page  document with the bolded words “For Court w/QOTV- 2nd in 12/15/24” at the top  left hand corner, a one-page document starting with the words “Fron Lisa M  Leonard” at the top left hand corner, a one-page document with the bolded words  “Court with qotv-4” at the top left hand corner, a one-page document with the  bolded words “Court with qotv-5” at the top left hand corner, a one-page  document with the bolded words “Court with QOTV-6” at the top left hand corner,  four pages of photographs, a one-page August 8, 1995 correspondence from Nancy  L. Sherman RN, Nurse Manager M/SICU at Kern Medical Center addressed “To Whom  it may concern,” a photograph accompanied by handwriting reading “Lisa M  Leonard,” and a one-page document reading “LifeStance Health” at the top. On  January 15, 2025, Defendant filed a reply brief. The  Court does not appear to be in receipt of any document purporting to constitute  Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint; as such, the Court will continue the  hearing, to February 13, 2025, at 10 a.m. Plaintiff is directed to  confirm on the record that the document referenced above by Defendant as “a  declaration [filed] on November 12, 2024” is, in fact, the Second Amended  Complaint; if so, Plaintiff is instructed to file and serve said document, without  any change, no later than January 30, 2025. The Court will not permit any  further briefing.
