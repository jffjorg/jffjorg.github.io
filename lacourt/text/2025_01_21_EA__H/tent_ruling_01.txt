  Case Number:  23PSCV01975    Hearing Date:   January 21, 2025    Dept:  H Jaite v. Campa, Case No. 23PSCV01975 
ORDER ON DEFAULT JUDGMENT APPLICATION 
Plaintiff Billy Jaite’s Application for
Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
Background 
Plaintiff Billy Jaite (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
Plaintiff and Vanessa Campa (“Defendant”) were in a relationship from
approximately May 2017-April 2022. During their relationship, Plaintiff grew
close to Defendant’s daughter, Victoria Isabela Fernandez (“Victoria”).
Plaintiff paid Defendant’s rent from approximately October 2017 to November
2022, in large part to ensure Victoria would not be homeless. Throughout the
years, Plaintiff and Defendant had numerous discussions about establishing a
trust for Victoria’s exclusive benefit. After Plaintiff and Defendant ended
their relationship, Plaintiff made four transfers to Defendant in November and
December 2022 totaling $350,000.00, with the mutual understanding and oral
agreement that these transfers would be put into the trust established for Victoria.
Defendant has ceased all communication with Plaintiff. Defendant is living off
the monies and has failed to establish the trust. 
On June
30, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting causes of action against
Defendant for: (1) specific performance of contract, and (2) breach of contract. 
On
August 17, 2023, Defendant’s default was entered. 
Pending
before the Court is Plaintiff’s application for default judgment. 
 
Discussion 
Plaintiff’s
application for default judgment is denied without prejudice. The
following defects are noted:
1.
      Plaintiff attests that “[t]hroughout
the course of my relationship with Defendant, Defendant and I discussed on
numerous occasions the establishment of a trust for Victoria’s benefit in order
to provide her with health, education, maintenance, and support. After
Defendant and I ended our relationship around August 3, 2022, I still desired
to take care of Victoria. Knowing that I would not be there to raise Victoria,
I wanted to make sure she was financially taken care of. I therefore made four
(4) wire transfers to Defendant totaling three hundred fifty thousand dollars
($350,000.00) under the mutual understanding and oral agreement that all of
these funds would be put into a trust established by Defendant for Victoria’s
benefit.” (Plaintiff’s Decl., ¶ 4.) It is unclear to the Court when the oral
contract was established, what the terms of the contract were, and when the
terms of the contract were communicated to/by Defendant. The Court requests
further information in this regard.
2.
      The prayer in Plaintiff’s complaint
requests that the Court order Defendant to establish a trust for Victoria’s
benefit and to transfer $350,000.00 into said trust, or alternatively, to
transfer $350,000.00 to Plaintiff and “[f]or such other relief as is just and
equitable herein.” Plaintiff seeks $37,972.60 in interest and $1,334.23 in
costs via this instant default prove-up application; however, Plaintiff’s
prayer does not seek costs or interest.
3.
      Plaintiff represents that he wired
$350,000.00 total to Defendant between November 21, 2022 to December 7, 2022,
via one transfer of $50,000.00 and three transfers of $100,000.00 each. (Id.,
¶ 4, Exh. 1.) Exhibit 1, however, does not provide the Court with any
information as to the recipient of any of these wire transfers or the year of
these transfers.
4.
      Plaintiff makes certain statements
in Paragraph 6 (i.e., that “for her own personal benefit and has been living
off such funds” and that “Defendant failed to establish the trust as Defendant
had promised to do”) and Paragraph 7 (i.e., “Defendant deleted all my photo
albums and text messages”) “upon information and belief.” (Star Motor
Imports, Inc. v. Superior Court (1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 201, 204 [“An
affidavit based on ‘information and belief’ is hearsay and must be disregarded,
and it is ‘unavailing for any purpose’ whatsoever”].) Plaintiff must provide
the Court with evidence supporting these statements.
5.
      Plaintiff makes reference to hiring
a phone forensics specialist, Matthew Albee from DataChasers, Inc., but fails
to provide a declaration from him with regard to his unsuccessful data
retrieval efforts. 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s application is denied without prejudice, and Plaintiff is directed
to submit a revised and complete default judgment packet that addresses the aforementioned
issues.
