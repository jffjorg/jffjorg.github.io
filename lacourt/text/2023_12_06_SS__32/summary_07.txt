And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion of Plaintiff Abelino Esquivel's Counsel, Daniel Hakhamzadeh, to be relieved as Counsel without prejudice. The motion is procedurally defective due to Counsel's failure to provide correct notice of the hearing and the proposed order being blank. Although Counsel has filed the required forms, the judge finds that the motion does not comply with the legal standards set forth in California Rules of Court (CRC) 3.1362 and California Rule of Professional Conduct (CRPC) 3.700. The judge notes that an attorney's right to terminate the attorney-client relationship and withdraw from a case is not absolute and that the decision whether to grant or deny an application for withdrawal is within the court's discretion.
