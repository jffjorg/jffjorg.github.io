And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition for minors compromise filed by Rogelia Berrera on behalf of Claimant A.B. and has denied the petition without prejudice. The court finds that Claimant has recovered completely and that the requested attorney fees and costs of $14,850 and $3,794.63, respectively, are reasonable. However, the court notes that the moving party failed to attach a copy of the retainer agreement in attachment 17a and must attach an itemized ledger of the costs. The court also orders the moving party to file and complete form MC-355 Order to Deposit Funds in Blocked Account. Finally, the court orders the moving party to give notice and notes that the net amount of the settlement does not match the amounts listed in the MC-351 and item 18b(2).
