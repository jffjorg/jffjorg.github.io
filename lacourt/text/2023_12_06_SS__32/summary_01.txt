And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the case. The plaintiff, Bethanne Packerd, filed a complaint against Rodolfo Martinez and others for injuries resulting from a motor vehicle/pedestrian accident. After multiple orders to show cause, the case was dismissed for failure to enter default. The plaintiff then filed a motion to vacate the dismissal, claiming that their counsel's calendaring error caused them to miss the order to show cause hearing. The judge finds that the calendaring error constitutes excusable neglect and grants the motion to set aside the dismissal. The judge sets the matter for an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal Failure to Enter Default/alternatively trial setting conference, and admonishes counsel for Plaintiff to properly enter default and obtain a judgment.
