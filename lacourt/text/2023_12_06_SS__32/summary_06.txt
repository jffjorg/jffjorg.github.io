Summary:

This is a tentative ruling in the case of Delbert Webb v. Ann Migyom Kim, The Hertz Corporation, and Does 1-50. The case involves a motion to compel the deposition of Defendant Ann Migyom Kim, who has failed to appear for deposition on three separate occasions. The Court grants the motion and orders Defendant to appear for deposition within 15 days. The Court also awards Plaintiff $661.65 in monetary sanctions against Defendant and her attorney of record. The Court finds that Defendant's objections to deposition were not valid as she failed to provide alternative dates or pursue the deposition in good faith.
