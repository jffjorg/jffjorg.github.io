      Robert

communicate. Counsel served the motion on the client by email and mail.
Counsel has not been able to confirm the client’s address despite a skip trace search.
 Counsel has complied with the
requirements of California Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362.
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED. The order is effective upon the filing of
the proof of service of the signed order upon the client.
