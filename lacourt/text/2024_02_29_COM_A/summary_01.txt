And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for a separate judgment by default against the seller, Tony and Z Auto Motors. The plaintiff purchased a 2006 Chevrolet Silverado from the seller for $18,008.49, but the vehicle was unmerchantable and needed costly repairs. The plaintiff alleges claims for violations of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act, Business & Professions Code § 17200, and Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The plaintiff also seeks contract-based remedies, including rescission, reimbursement, and cancellation of the sales contract.

However, the court has found that the plaintiff has not established grounds for a separate judgment against the seller. The plaintiff's request for punitive damages is also denied because the plaintiff did not allege a basis for the claim. Additionally, the court has found that the plaintiff's request for attorney's fees is not supported by a statutory or contractual basis.

The court has set an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal or Default Judgment against Washington International Insurance Company and Tony Z Auto Motors for April 23, 2024. The plaintiff is ordered to correct the defects identified in the ruling and submit a corrected Request for Court Judgment against both defendants or dismissal of WIIC no less than 10 court days before the continued hearing date.
