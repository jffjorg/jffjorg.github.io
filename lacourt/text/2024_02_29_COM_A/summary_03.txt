This tentative ruling grants the motion of Robert Reza Vanderveer, counsel for Plaintiff Michael Leonard Larson, to be relieved as counsel of record. The Plaintiff no longer responds to counsel's attempts to communicate, and despite efforts to serve the motion on the client by email and mail, counsel is unable to confirm the client's address. Counsel has complied with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362, and the motion is therefore granted. The order will take effect once proof of service of the signed order is filed with the court.
