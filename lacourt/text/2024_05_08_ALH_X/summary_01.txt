And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff's motion to enforce an oral settlement agreement made on March 19, 2024. The agreement was recorded by the court reporter, but the transcript was not certified and was not properly authenticated by Plaintiff. The judge finds that Plaintiff's proposed judgment does not accurately reflect the terms of the oral settlement, and therefore, the motion is denied.
