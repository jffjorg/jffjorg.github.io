RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Plaintiff seeks to compel the
deposition of Defendant’s Person Most Qualified (“PMQ”). 
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff’s purchase
of an allegedly defective vehicle that was manufactured by Defendant.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Plaintiff’s
motion to compel the deposition of Defendant’s PMQ is GRANTED.
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff seeks to compel the deposition of Defendant’s Person Most
Qualified (“PMQ”).
 
If a party or an officer, director,
managing agent, employee of a party, or person designated as the person most
qualified to testify fails to appear for examination or produce documents
without serving a valid objection, the demanding party may move to compel
attendance, testimony, and production. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) The motion must be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration that states facts showing a reasonable and
good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the
motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2025.450,
subd. (b)(2).)
 
Plaintiff served Notices of
Deposition for Defendant’s PMQ on February 3, 2023 and January 8, 2024.  (Gonzalez Decl. ¶¶ 6, 11.)  Each time, Defendant objected that
“Plaintiff’s counsel failed to meet and confer before unilaterally noticing
this deposition.”  (Gonzalez Decl. ¶¶ 7,
12; id., Exs. 2, 5.)
 
Defendant contends that it is “not
refusing to provide a corporate witness in this matter,” but “[i]t has been
extremely difficult for Defendant AHM to match the recent surge in demand for
depositions of persons most qualified.”  (Opposition
at pp. 3-4.)  Defendant argues that
“Plaintiff simply cannot file a lawsuit, make serious allegations, and then
file unnecessary motions without making a true effort to meet and confer with
Defendant AHM to set a mutually-agreeable date for such a deposition.”  (Id. at p. 4.)
 
Defendant’s objection is not a
“valid objection under Section 2025.410.” 
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)  Section 2025.410 requires a party to
serve written objections to a deposition notice “that does not comply with
Article 2 (commencing with Section 2025.210),” or else the party waives any
error or irregularity.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2025.410., subd. (a).)  Valid
objections include, for example, defects in the notice, lack of particularity
of the matters for deposition, and improper deposition location.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2025.210-2025.295.)  Valid objections do not include the date
being unilaterally set or inconvenient for a busy PMQ witness.
 
Additionally, Plaintiff did make a
good faith effort to meet and confer about the timing of the deposition.  Plaintiff’s counsel emailed or called
Defendant’s counsel about alternate deposition dates on January 12, 2024;
January 26, 2024; and February 13, 2024, but Defendant never responded.  (Gonzalez Decl. ¶¶ 13-16.; id., Exs.
6-8.)
 
            Defendant
did not serve valid objections and did not produce its PMQ for a properly noticed
deposition.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (a).)  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
motion to compel the deposition of Defendant’s PMQ is granted.
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s motion
to compel the deposition of Defendant’s PMQ is GRANTED.  Defendant is ordered to produce its PMQ
within 30 days or any other date stipulated by the parties.
 
            Moving party
to give notice.
