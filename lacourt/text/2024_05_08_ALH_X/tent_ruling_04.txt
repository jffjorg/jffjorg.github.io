RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
            Plaintiff seeks to reinstate this
action, which was dismissed on November 16, 2023.
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Defendant allegedly
injuring Plaintiff’s wrist.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff’s motion to vacate dismissal
is DENIED.
 
DISCUSSION
 
On November 6, 2023, Plaintiff did
not appear at the Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to File Proof of Service, so
the Court ordered the first amended complaint dismissed without prejudice.
 
Plaintiff filed a motion to vacate
the order of dismissal.  The Court denied
that motion on February 7, 2024 and explained to Plaintiff the legal basis for
his tentative ruling.
 
On March 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
“Motion for Reply Memorandum Supporting Motion to Vacate and Set Aside Default
and Default Judgement.”  At the April 8,
2024 hearing, the Court deemed it a motion pursuant to California Code of Civil
Procedure section 473(b).  The Court
directed Plaintiff to provide proof of service to counsel for the Defendant
before the next court date, and the Court provided the name and contact
information for defense counsel.  The
Court also ordered Plaintiff to file proof of service of the Amended Complaint
prior to the next court date.
 
On April 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
Proof of Service by personal service. 
The form is almost completely blank. 
Plaintiff does not identify what documents were served, upon whom they
were served, where they were served, or when they were served.
 
Defendant’s lack of opposition to
this motion further suggests that it was not served.
 
Because Plaintiff did not comply
with the Court’s April 8, 2024 order, the motion to vacate dismissal is denied.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff’s motion to vacate
dismissal is DENIED.
