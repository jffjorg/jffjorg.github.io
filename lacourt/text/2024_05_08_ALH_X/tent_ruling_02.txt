RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
            Defendant seeks to have all matters set
forth in Requests for Admission (Set One) admitted. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Defendant’s alleged breach
of a construction contract and failure to pay Plaintiff.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant’s motion to deem all matters
set forth in Requests for Admission (Set One) admitted is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ORDERED to pay sanctions of $635.00
to Defendant within 30 days.
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant MAC Construction Builders,
Inc. seeks to
have all matters set forth in Requests for Admission (Set One) admitted by
Plaintiff The Bird and The Bear LLC.
 
When a party fails to timely respond
to a request for admission, the propounding party may move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests
be deemed admitted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (b).)  The party who failed to respond
waives any objections to the demand, unless the court grants them relief from the
waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially
compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result of
mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)  The court shall grant a motion to deem admitted
requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed
response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section
2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (c).)
 
On February 15, 2024, Defendant propounded
Requests for Admission (Set One) on Plaintiff. 
(Porto Decl. ¶ 10.)  The parties agreed
to extend Plaintiff’s deadline to provide responses to all outstanding written discovery
to March 29, 2024.  (Porto Decl. ¶ 11.)
 
Plaintiff did not serve timely responses
and did not file an opposition to the motion. 
Therefore, it does not appear that Plaintiff served substantially compliant
responses prior to the hearing.
 
Defendant’s motion to deem all matters
set forth in Requests for Admission (Set One) admitted is granted.  Defendant’s request for sanctions is also granted.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  Plaintiff is ordered to pay sanctions of $635.00
to Defendant within 30 days.
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Defendant’s motion
to deem all matters set forth in Requests for Admission (Set One) admitted is GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff is ORDERED to pay sanctions
of $635.00 to Defendant within 30 days.
