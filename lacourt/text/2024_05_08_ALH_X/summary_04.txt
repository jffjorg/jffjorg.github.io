And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling by Judge Joel L. Lofton states that the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the case is denied. The case arises from an alleged injury to the plaintiff's wrist. The plaintiff had previously failed to appear at an order to show cause, leading to the dismissal of the case. The plaintiff then filed a motion to vacate the dismissal, which was denied. The court directed the plaintiff to provide proof of service to the defendant's counsel before the next court date, but the plaintiff failed to comply with this order. The plaintiff's subsequent proof of service was incomplete and did not provide sufficient information about the documents served, the recipients, the location, or the date of service. The court found that the plaintiff did not comply with its order and denied the motion to vacate the dismissal.
