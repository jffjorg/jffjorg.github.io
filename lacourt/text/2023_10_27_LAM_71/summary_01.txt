```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant's motion to enforce deposition subpoena on Sunbelt Realty Services. The motion is untimely because Defendant did not file it within the 60-day period after the Policy Holder objected to the subpoena. Additionally, the judge found that Defendant did not properly serve Sunbelt with the deposition subpoena, which is required by California law. As a result, the judge denied the motion and ordered Defendant to give notice.
