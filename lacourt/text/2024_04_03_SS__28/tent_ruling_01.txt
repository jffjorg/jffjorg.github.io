[Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding [on  the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson v. Superior  Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338; see Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et  seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.)  To  obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner  must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and  must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of  the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co.  (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)  DISCUSSION       Morse offered to settle all six Plaintiffs' claims for $15,000.00.  Plaintiffs accepted the offer and allocated $2,500.00 (out of the $15,000.00 settlement amount) to each of the six Plaintiffs, including Plaintiffs Alaia Vasquez and Jacob Vasquez.  With reductions for attorney's fees and costs, Plaintiff Jacob Vasquez will receive $1,855.05 and Plaintiff Alaia Vasquez will receive $1,855.05. The Court corrects the statement in Section 10 of each petition that the settlement amount for each claimant (Alaia Vasquez and Jacob Vasquez) is $15,000.00.  As just explained, the six Plaintiffs and Morse entered into a global settlement for $15,000.00, which the six Plaintiffs have allocated equally among themselves.  Plaintiffs Alaia Vasquez and Jacob Vasquez will each receive $1,855.05, which is their equal share of the $15,000.00 global settlement amount with reductions for attorney's fees and costs. Subject to this understanding, the Court grants the petitions. CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS the petition for  approval of the compromise of the pending action of Plaintiff Jacob Vasquez against Defendant Curtis Deondis Morse filed by Petitioner Ericka  Vasquez on March 4, 2024.  The net balance will be deposited in an insured account in Chase Bank, Downey Branch, 13535 Lakewood Boulevard, Downey, CA 90242 and will be subject to withdrawal only on the Court's authorization.
