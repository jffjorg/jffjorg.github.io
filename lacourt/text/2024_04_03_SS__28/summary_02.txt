Significant Statements:
  - "A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem)
  - "A terminating sanction is a 'drastic measure which should be employed with caution.'" (Deyo v. Kilbourne)
  - "A party persists in disobeying the court's orders, terminating sanctions are appropriate." (Deyo v. Kilbourne)
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied without prejudice the motion for terminating, issue, evidentiary, and monetary sanctions filed by defendants Luis Enrique Ordaz and Erika Munoz Conde. The motion was filed in response to plaintiffs' non-compliance with a discovery order. The judge found that while plaintiffs did not comply with the discovery order, the defendants did not provide sufficient information to support their request for issue or evidentiary sanctions. The judge also noted that the defendants did not properly serve their motion on the plaintiffs, as the proof of service did not include electronic mail addresses for the plaintiffs. The judge concluded that terminating sanctions were not appropriate in this case, and instead denied the motion for sanctions.
