production of documents, set one, special interrogatories, set one, and form
interrogatories, set one, and to deem admitted matters specified in requests
for admission, set one.  Plaintiff also requested
sanctions.  The motions were set for hearing

one, and form interrogatories, set one, and to deem admitted matters specified
in requests for admission, set one.

LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order
compelling a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including
the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent exceptional
circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or any attorney
of a party for failure to provide electronically stored information that has
been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of the routine, good
faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides: 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) 
C.      Requests for admission 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides: 
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The requesting party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(c) The court shall make
this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission
have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed
response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with
Section 2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or
both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
necessitated this motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
DISCUSSION 
On April
24, 2023, Plaintiff served request for production of documents, set one,
special interrogatories, set one, form interrogatories, set one, and requests
for admission, set one, on Defendant.  Defendant
did not provide timely responses and had not provided responses by the time Plaintiff
filed the motions to compel on January 5,
2024. 
Defendant
asserts that she served verified responses to Plaintiff’s request for production
of documents, special interrogatories, form interrogatories, and requests for
admission on March 18, 2024.  Defendant
asks the Court to deny Plaintiff’s motions and requests for sanctions. 
Plaintiff
does not deny that his counsel received Defendant’s March 18, 2024 discovery responses
but argues the Court should nonetheless award sanctions to compensate him for
having to file these motions. 
Defendant’s
service of discovery responses on March 18, 2024 renders moot Plaintiff’s
requests to compel discovery responses and to deem admitted matters specified
in requests for admission. 
The
Court is required, however, to grant Plaintiff’s request for sanctions on his motion to
deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c) [“It
is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose
failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion”].)  Plaintiff requests $860.00 in
sanctions based on three hours of attorney time at a rate of $400.00 per hour and
one $60.00 filing fee.  Counsel spent 1.5
hours preparing the moving papers and anticipated spending .5 hours to review
the opposition and prepare a reply and one hour to attend the hearing.  The Court grants $560.00 in sanctions based
on two hours of attorney time at a reasonable rate of $250.00 per hour and one
filing fee. 
Plaintiff
also requests sanctions on the motions to compel responses to the request for
production of documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories.  Under Code of Civil Procedure sections
2030.290 and 2031.300, sanctions are available against parties, persons, and
attorneys who unsuccessfully make or oppose a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories or requests for production. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) [interrogatories],
2031.300, subd. (c) [demand for inspection].) 
Defendant’s oppositions were successful because the Court is denying
these motions as moot.  Therefore,
sanctions are not available under these statutes. 
Other
statutes addressing misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves, authorize
a sanctions award.  (See Code Civ. Proc,
§ 2023.010.)  Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.010 is “ ‘definitional’ and monetary sanctions may not be imposed
based solely on [the statute].  Monetary
sanctions may be imposed only if authorized by some other provision of the
Discovery Act.”  (L. Edmon & C.
Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶
8:1900, p. 8M-2; see Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030 [court may impose sanctions
for misuse of the discovery process “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter
governing any particular discovery method or other provision of this title”]; City
of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466,
498-504.) 
The
Court therefore denies Plaintiff’s requests for monetary sanctions on the
motions to compel responses to the request for production of documents, special
interrogatories, and form interrogatories. 
Plaintiff
should have filed the motion to compel responses to the special interrogatories
and form interrogatories as two motions, one for each type of discovery.  The Court orders Plaintiff to pay an
additional $60.00 filing fee to the Court. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES AS MOOT Plaintiff Freddy Funes’s motion to compel responses to request
for production of documents, set one. 
The Court DENIES AS MOOT
Plaintiff Freddy Funes’s motion to compel responses to special interrogatories,
set one. 
The Court DENIES AS MOOT Plaintiff Freddy Funes’s
motion to compel responses to form interrogatories, set one. 
The Court DENIES AS MOOT Plaintiff Freddy Funes’s
motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission, set one, except with
respect to Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions. 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff
Freddy Funes’s request for sanctions on his motion to deem admitted matters
specified in requests for admission and orders Defendant Ermine
Pilavdzhyan and her counsel to pay Plaintiff Freddy Funes $560.00 in sanctions
by May 1, 2024. 
The Court orders Plaintiff Freddy Funes to pay one additional
$60.00 filing fee to the Court by May 1, 2024. 
Moving
party is to give notice of the Court’s ruling. 
Moving
party is to file proof of service of the Court’s ruling within five days.
