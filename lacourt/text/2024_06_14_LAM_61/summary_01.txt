And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to compel arbitration of the Plaintiff's claims. The arbitration agreement was executed on January 24, 2019, as part of the Plaintiff's hiring and onboarding process with the Defendants. The Plaintiff argues that the agreement is unenforceable under 9 U.S.C. § 402, which prevents the enforcement of arbitration agreements in actions based on sexual harassment. However, the Court finds that the Plaintiff's claims accrued prior to the effective date of the statute. The Plaintiff also argues that the agreement is unconscionable, but the Court finds that there is no substantively unconscionable aspect of the agreement. The motion is therefore granted and the case will proceed to arbitration.
