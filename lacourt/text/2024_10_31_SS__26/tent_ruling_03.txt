Mercury Ins. Co. v. Romans, et al.MOTION TO VACATE ENTRY OF DEFAULT OR DEFAULT
JUDGMENT
(CCP § 473(b))

                                                                                                                                
ANALYSIS:
 
On March 11, 2024, Plaintiff Mercury
Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendant Dusti
Romans (“Defendant”). Following Defendant’s failure to file a responsive
pleading, the Court entered Defendant’s default on May 1, 2024. Defendant filed
a Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment on June 7, 2024, which was set for
hearing on September 30, 2024. Plaintiff filed an opposition on August 8, 2024.
 
On September 26, 2024, defense counsel spoke
to Plaintiff’s counsel and the department clerk in order to vacate the hearing
date. (Motion, Barella Decl., ¶13.) The department clerk continued the hearing
date to October 31, 2024. (Ibid.) On October 9, 2024, Defendant sought
to file the new motion but it was rejected by the Court because it was filed
under the prior reservation number. (Id. at ¶14 and Exh. E.) The notice
of rejection advised Defendant to file the new motion as an “amended motion” so
as to not pay an additional filing fee. (Ibid.) The Amended Motion was
filed on October 15, 2024. Plaintiff filed an opposition on October 18, 2024
and Defendant replied on October 24, 2024.
 
Discussion
 
Procedural Objections
 
To the extent Plaintiff opposes the Amended
Motion as procedurally improper, the Court overrules those objections.
Plaintiff does not dispute that Defendant sought to file a new motion and,
through the clerk of the department, obtained a hearing date that was indicated
to be a “continued hearing date.” Furthermore, the clerk of the Court advised
Defendant to file the new motion as an “amended motion” in order to not pay the
additional filing fee. The Amended Motion, therefore, is a new motion to vacate
addressed to the entry of default.
 
Evidentiary Objections
 
Plaintiff’s evidentiary objections to the
Barella declaration are sustained as to paragraphs 6, 7, 10 and 11, and
overruled as to paragraph 14. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 473(d)
 
Defendant moves for relief from entry of default
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d), which states
that “[t]he court may, .... on motion of either party after notice to the other
party, set aside any void judgment or order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd.
(d).) Defendant contends the entry of default is void for lack of proper
service and may be vacated on those grounds. (Citing Ellard v. Conway
(2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 540, 544.) Defendant disputes that they were personally
served as stated in the proof of service filed by Plaintiff, or that any
attempt at service was made as stated. (Motion, Romans Decl., ¶¶2-4.) 
 
As Plaintiff points out in opposition, a proof of service containing a declaration from a
registered process server invokes a rebuttable presumption affecting the
burden of producing evidence, of the facts stated in the return. (Cal. Evid.
Code, § 647; see American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199
Cal.App.4th 383, 390.) The party seeking to defeat service of process must
present sufficient evidence to show that the service did not take place as
stated.  (See Rios v. Singh (2021) 65 Cal.App.5th 871, 885; Cruz v. Fagor
America, Inc. (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 488, 509.) The Court finds this
declaration is insufficient to overcome the presumption of proper service.
Defendant’s first motion to vacate made no mention of improper service, nor did
defense counsel when speaking to Plaintiff’s counsel prior to moving for
relief. (Motion, filed 06/07/24, pp. 1-4; Opp., Laurie Decl., ¶5.) Based on the
lack of evidentiary facts regarding improper service in Defendant’s declaration
and their failure to raise this issue until filing the instant Amended Motion,
the Court finds Defendant has not demonstrated that service of the Summons and
Complaint was improper, such that the entry of default was void.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Dusti Romans’ Amended Motion to Set
Aside Entry of Default is DENIED. 
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
