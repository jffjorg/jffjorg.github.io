And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the amended application for admission pro hac vice filed by Attorney Jenna Fischman, Esq. on behalf of Defendant Playa Hotels & Resorts, LLC. The application was initially denied due to defects, including failure to demonstrate service on the California State Bar, payment of the application fee, and proof of service by mail. The amended application corrected these defects and was granted due to the abuse-of-discretion standard. The judge noted that absent special circumstances, repeated appearances by out-of-state counsel in California lawsuits is cause for denial of their application.
