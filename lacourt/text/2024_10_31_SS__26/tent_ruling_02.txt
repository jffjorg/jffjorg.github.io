ANALYSIS:
 
On March 5, 2024, Petitioner The High Way, LLC
(“Petitioner”) filed the instant Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award (the
“Petition”) against Respondent Michael Connor Mulqueeney (“Respondent”). The
Petition initially came for hearing on July 9, 2024 and was continued to give
Petitioner an opportunity to demonstrate proper service on Respondent.
Petitioner filed proof of service on August 30, 2024. (Minute Order, 07/09/24.)
No opposition to the Petition has been filed to date.
 
 
Legal Standard
 
“Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made
may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.  The petition shall name as respondent all
parties to the arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound
by the arbitration award.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1285.) “If a petition or response under this chapter is duly
served and filed, the court shall confirm the award as made, whether rendered
in this state or another state, unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects
the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the
proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1286.)
 
A response to a
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award that seeks to vacate or correct the award
must be served and filed no later than 100 days after the date of the service
of a signed copy of the award on the respondent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288.2.)
 
Discussion
 
Code of Civil
Procedure, section 1290.4 requires that the Petition and Notice of Hearing be
served on Respondent “in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for
the service of such petition and notice” or “[i]f the arbitration agreement
does not provide the manner in which such service shall be made . . . [s]ervice
within this State shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service
of summons in an action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4, subds. (a), (b).) 
 
As the arbitration agreement does not provide for the manner
of service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing, those papers must be served
in the manner of service for a summons. (Pet., Attachment 4(b).) Proof of
substitute service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing has been filed. (Proof of Service, filed 08/30/24.) Therefore,
the Court finds that the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4
are satisfied. 
 
Service of the Arbitration Award and Timing of Service
of Petition (CCP §§ 1283.6, 1288, 1288.4)
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 1283.6 requires that “[t]he neutral arbitrator shall serve a
signed copy of the award on each party to the arbitration personally or by
registered or certified mail or as provided in the agreement.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1283.6.) This requirement may be satisfied by service by the
arbitrator, or upon proper service of the Award with the Petition. (See Murry v. Civil Service Employees Ins. Co. (1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 796, 799-800.) The
arbitration award is not accompanied by a proof of service, but Petitioner has
demonstrated that the award was served on Respondent with the instant Petition.
(Pet., Attachment 8(c).)
 
Also, a party seeking a court judgment confirming an
arbitration award must file and serve the petition no more than four years, but
not less than 10 days, after the award is served.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.) Petitioner has demonstrated
compliance with Code of Civil Procedure
section 1288 and 1288.4 by serving the instant Petition less than a year
after the award was issued on December 13, 2023. 
 
Confirmation of the Arbitration Award
 
An arbitration award
is not directly enforceable until it is confirmed by a court and judgment is
entered.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1287.6; Jones
v. Kvistad (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 836, 840.) The court must confirm the award
as made, unless it corrects or vacates the award, or dismisses the
proceeding.  (CCP § 1286; Valsan
Partners Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25
Cal.App.4th 809, 818.) Code of Civil Procedure, section 1285.4 states a
petition under this chapter shall:
 
a)     
Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of
the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of such
an agreement.
 
b)     
Set forth the names of the arbitrators.
 
c)     
Set forth or have attached a copy of the award and the
written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.) The Petition complies with the
above requirements. It sets forth the nature of the arbitration agreement and
the name of the arbitrator. (Pet., ¶¶4, 6 and Attachment 4(b).) A copy of the
arbitration award is also attached. (Id. at Attachment 8(c).)
Substantively, the Petition demonstrates that Petitioner is entitled to $25,668.00
from Respondent. (Id. at Attachment 8(c), ¶¶7-11.) 
 
Attorney’s Fees, Costs, and Interest
 
To the extent Petitioner requests costs and fees according
to proof (Pet., ¶10), those are permitted on a petition to confirm arbitration
award. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1293.2; MBNA America Bank, N.A. v. Gorman
(2006) 147 Cal.App.4th.Supp. 1, 7.) Petitioner may file a memorandum of costs
pursuant to Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1700 and a motion for attorney’s fees
pursuant to Cal. Rules of Court 3.1702. Petitioner also seeks interest .(Pet.,
¶10(d).) “[A] successful party to arbitration is entitled to post-award,
pre-judgment interest under Civil Code section 3287, subdivision (a). (Pierotti
v. Torian (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 17, 27.) The rate awarded is that
stipulated by the contract or, if not stipulated, ten percent. (Civ. Code, §
3289.) Petitioner may include the interest calculation in the proposed
judgment. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, Petitioner The High Way, LLC’s Petition to
Confirm Arbitration Award is GRANTED. JUDGMENT IS TO BE ENTERED IN FAVOR OF
PETITIONER AND AGAINST RESPONDENT MICHAEL CONNOR MULQUEENEY IN THE PRINCIPAL
AMOUNT OF $25,668.00. PETITIONER IS TO FILE A PROPOSED JUDGMENT WITHIN
20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
