TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorney Jenna
Fischman, Esq.’s Amended Application for Admission as Counsel Pro Hac Vice for Defendant Playa Hotels

ANALYSIS:
 
On June 17, 2024, Plaintiff Nikola Spasojevic (“Plaintiff”) filed
the instant action against Defendant Playa Hotels & Resorts, LLC
(“Defendant”). Defendant filed a motion to dismiss for forum non conveniens,
which is set to be heard on November 7, 2024. Attorney Jenna Fischman, Esq.
(“Applicant”) filed the instant Application for Admission Pro Hac Vice on
August 27, 2024. The Application initially came for hearing on October 16,
2024, at which time the matter was continued to allow the Applicant to correct the
following defects: failure to demonstrate (1) service on the California State
Bar; (2) payment of the application fee to the State Bar; and (3) proof of
service by of the application and notice of hearing of the application on all
parties who have appeared in the case. (Minute Order, 10/16/24.) On the same
date, Applicant filed the instant Amended Application for Admission Pro Hac
Vice. To date, no opposition has been filed.
 
Counsel
who are not active members of the California State Bar, and have not been
granted permission to appear pro hac
vice, are prohibited from representing a party in California courts. (Gentis
v. Safeguard Bus. Systems, Inc. (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1294, 1308.) Absent
consent, local practice by out-of state counsel in California courts is
disallowed. (Birbrower, Montalbano, Condon & Frank v. Superior
Court (1998) 17 Cal.4th 119, 130; Consumers Lobby against Monopolies v.
PUC (1979) 25 Cal. 3d 891, 914 n.11.) “It is common practice … to permit
upon request an attorney holding a license to practice law from one state to
appear in the courts of a sister state, and there take part in the trial of an
action pending in said courts.” (In re Application of McCue (1930) 211
Cal. 57, 67.) A judge’s determination of whether to grant an application to
appear pro hac vice is
evaluated under the abuse-of-discretion standard. (Walter E.
Heller Western, Inc. v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 706, 711; United
States Golf Ass'n v. Arroyo Software Corp. (1999) 69 Cal. App. 4th 607,
624; Magee v. Superior Court (1973) 8 Cal.3d 949, 953-54 (criminal
action).  Appearance pro hac vice is a privilege and not a right under the United States
constitution. (Leis v. Flynt (1979) 439 U.S. 438, 441.) “Absent special
circumstances, repeated appearances by out-of-state counsel in California
lawsuits is cause for denial of his or her application.” Walter E. Heller,
111 Cal.App.3d at 706.)
