And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by Berkley Insurance Company to amend the name of the plaintiff. The motion is continued to January 30, 2025, at 10:00 AM in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse. By January 2, 2025, the plaintiff must file supplemental papers correcting the defects noted in the ruling. Failure to do so may result in the motion being denied. The court's analysis indicates that the plaintiff's motion is not yet satisfied because it lacks specific information about the new evidence discovered and the reasons for the delay in making the amendment.
