ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Berkeley
Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendant Real
Estate Related Services West (“Defendant”) on November 16, 2023. On August
30, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Leave to Amend the Name of the
Plaintiff. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff moves for leave to file
a First Amended Complaint under Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (a), which provides: 
 
The court may, in furtherance of
justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading
or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting
a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect; and may,
upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or demurrer. The court may
likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any
terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other
particulars; and may upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time
limited by this code.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd.
(a)(1).) 
 
A motion for leave to amend a
pleading must also comply with the procedural requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule
3.1324, which requires a supporting declaration to set forth explicitly what
allegations are to be added and where, and explicitly stating what new evidence
was discovered warranting the amendment and why the amendment was not made
earlier. The motion must also include (1) a copy of the proposed and numbered
amendment, (2) specifications by reference to pages and lines of the allegations
that would be deleted and added, and (3) a declaration specifying the effect,
necessity and propriety of the amendments, date of discovery and reasons for
delay. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, subds. (a), (b).)
 
The Motion is supported by a declaration that vaguely
states Plaintiff had a structural, organizational change and is now known as
Great Divide Insurance Company. (Motion, Chow Decl., ¶3.) The declaration,
however, does not expressly state what new evidence was discovered warranting
the amendment and why the amendment was not made earlier. Nor does the Motion
include (1) a copy of the proposed and numbered amendment, (2) specifications
by reference to pages and lines of the allegations that would be deleted and
added, and (3) a declaration specifying the effect, necessity and propriety of
the amendments, date of discovery, and reasons for delay. Therefore, the requirements
for leave to amend the Complaint are not yet satisfied.
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Berkley Insurance
Company’s Motion to Amend the Name of the Plaintiff is CONTINUED TO JANUARY 30,
2025 AT 10:00 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. BY JANUARY
2, 2025, PLAINTIFF IS TO FILE SUPPLEMENTAL PAPERS CORRECTING THE DEFECTS NOTED
HEREIN. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN THE MOTION BEING DENIED.
