Background
 
On August 28, 2023, Plaintiff Hightimes Holding
Corp. (“Plaintiff”) filed its Complaint against Defendants John Jezzini,
Elevate Capital Investments, LLC, and Elevate Capital Holdings, Inc.
(“Defendants”) on causes of action of intentional interference with existing
contract and intentional interference with prospective economic relations.
 
On October 5, 2023, Defendants separately filed
their respective answers to Plaintiff’s complaint.
 
On April 15, 2024, Defendant John Jezzini
(“Jezzini”) filed this Motion to Deem Request for Admissions, Set One, Admitted
against Plaintiff. No opposition or other response has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
 
When a party fails to serve a
timely response to a request for admission, the party propounding the request
for admission may move for an order to deem the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the requests admitted. (Code Civ.
Proc., §¿2033.280, subd. (b).) A party who fails to provide a timely response
waives any objection, including one based on privilege or work product. (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The court shall make this order, unless it finds that
the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served,
before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for
admission that is in substantial compliance with Section  2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction… on the party or attorney,
or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
necessitated this motion.” (Id., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
Discussion
 
Jezzini
contends to have served Request for Admissions, Set One, on Plaintiff on
February 9, 2024. (Declaration of John Cavan (“Cavan Decl.”), ¶ 2.) Jezzini
contends that Plaintiff responses were due on March 12, 2024. (Id., ¶
4.) The due date was then continued by stipulation, as requested by Plaintiff’s
counsel, to April 12, 2024. (Ibid.) Jezzini contends that Plaintiff has
not provided any responses. (Id., ¶ 5.) Thus, Jezzini argues that the
court should deem Jezzini’s request for admissions, set one, admitted and award
Jezzini monetary sanctions for $2,947.50 against Plaintiff. (Motion, at p. 3; Cavan
Decl., ¶¶ 6-7.) 
 
There
is no evidence before the court that would indicate Plaintiff responded to Jezzini’s
Request for Admissions. 
 
The
court grants Jezzini’s motion. Jezzini’s request for admissions, set one, are
deemed admitted.
 
With
respect to monetary sanctions, the court notes that they are mandatory in
connection with a motion to deem requests for admissions admitted. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
Since
Jezzini’s motion is unopposed, the court finds that Jezzini’s counsel does not
require an additional 2.00 hours to prepare reply papers. The court will
therefore award Jezzini monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,160.00,
comprised of $1,100.00 in attorney’s fees [2 hours to prepare the motion and
attend the hearing, multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate of $550.00], plus the $60.00
filing fee. Said monetary sanctions must be paid by Plaintiff within 20 days of
the court’s order. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant
John Jezzini’s Motion to Deem Request for Admissions, Set One, Admitted is
GRANTED. The court GRANTS Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions in the
reduced amount of $1,160.00. Plaintiff Hightimes Holding Corp. must pay said
monetary sanctions to Defendant within 20 days of the court’s order.
