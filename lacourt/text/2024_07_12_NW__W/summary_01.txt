And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to change jurisdiction for the purpose of collecting a judgment. The plaintiff, Pearlie Kate Miller, requested a change in jurisdiction because the defendant, Tiffany Warren, resides in Fairfield County, Ohio. However, the court has already entered a judgment in the plaintiff's favor, and the plaintiff must petition the Ohio State Court to enforce the California judgment in Ohio if they wish to do so. The relevant Ohio statutes outline the process for domesticating a foreign state judgment.
