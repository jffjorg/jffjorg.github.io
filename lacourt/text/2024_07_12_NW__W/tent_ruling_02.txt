LLC, UrbinoConstruction Services LLC, IO Lifetime Builders, Inc., Chai Group,
LLC, Serrano Demolition, Inc., Expert Decking and Waterproofing Experts, Inc.
and The Ohio Casualty Insurance Company, asserting causes of action for (1)

Plaintiffs
allege Defendants LivinIt Up, LLC, Moshe Zemach, David Zemach, Maya Librush,
Oded Zemach, UrbinoConstruction Services, LLC, IO Lifetime Builders, Inc., and
Chai Group, LLC (“Zemach Defendants”) misrepresented the condition of certain
real property sold to Plaintiff. The Zemach Defendants purchased the real
property in 2015 and had substantially remodeled the property. Plaintiffs
further allege Serrano Demolition was not a licensed contractor nor otherwise
qualified to perform the required work and caused damaged to the property.
Plaintiffs further allege Defendant Expert Decking and Waterproofing not only
delayed substantial completion of its scope of work, Defendant Expert Decking
also defectively and negligently performed its work causing Plaintiffs to
sustain even further damages.

against Roes 1 -100 for (1) equitable indemnity; (2) contribution; (3) comparative

against Serrano Demolition, Inc., Expert Decking and Water Proofing, Inc. and
James West on April 21, 2023 for equitable indemnity, contribution, declaratory
relief. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel the Further
Deposition of Defendant Livinit Up, LLC’s Person(s) Most Qualified and
Production of Documents is GRANTED. 
 
discussion
 
Plaintiff Alen Cohen
moves the court for an order compelling Defendant Livinit Up, LLC to produce
for oral examination its person(s) most qualified, who are adequately prepared
to testify on all 93 topics of examination; conduct a diligent search and
reasonable inquiry for all documents responsive to the Notice’s Requests for
Production of Documents No’s. 1-37 and produce all responsive documents by July
19, 2024; agree to produce Moshe Zemach for his continued oral examination
either July 24, 2024 or July 26, 2034 (after the production of all responsive
documents); serve complete, verified code-compliant responses to the Notice,
including each of the Requests, without any objections; and require Defendant’s
counsel to affirm, under oath and on July 19, 2024, that no documents have been
withheld from production and attesting to his and his client’s efforts to
locate and produce all documents responsive to the Requests. Plaintiff also
seeks an order imposing monetary sanctions in the amount of $18,725.00. 
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 2025.480 provides in relevant part that “[i]f a deponent
fails to answer any question or to produce any document…under the deponent's
control that is specified in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena,
the party seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling that
answer or production.” (CCP §2025.480(a).) The motion must be made “no later
than 60 days after the completion of the record of the deposition, and shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (CCP
§2025.480(b); see also Weinstein v. Blumberg (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 316,
321 [the 60-day deadline is mandatory].) Not less than five days prior to the
hearing on the motion, the moving party “shall lodge with the court a certified
copy of any parts of the stenographic transcript of the deposition that are
relevant to the motion.” (CCP §2025.480(h).)¿ 
 
The court notes
Defendant’s initial argument in opposition to the motion to compel further
deposition. Defendant avers the deposition of Defendant’s PMQ, Moshe Zemach,
took place on April 1, 2024 and was signed by the reporter on April 8, 2024.
(Hanigan Decl., Exh. 1.) Accordingly, Defendant contends the deposition record
was completed on April 8, 2024 and the mandatory provision of Section 2025.480
would have required the motion be made no later than 60 days after April 8,
2024 – June 7, 2024. Plaintiff, however, filed the motion June 14, 2024. 
 
Plaintiff argues that
the deposition was complete, at the earliest, on April 15, 2024, when the court
reporter first sent written notice to the parties that the deposition
transcript was available for review. (See CCP §2025.520; 15. [8:787] Motion to
Compel Answers: Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 8E-15.) The court
agrees. Section 2025.480(b) states that the motion “shall be made no later than
60 days after the completion of the record of the deposition, and shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.”  The deposition was held on April 1, 2024. The
court reporter sent notice under CCP section 2025.520 that the transcript was
ready for review on April 15, 2024. The thirty days for making changes to the
transcript under Section 2025.520 would have expired on May 15, 2024. That
being the latest date for completion of the record of the deposition, sixty
days later would have been July 15, 2024. Defendant filed its motion on June
14, 2024. Accordingly, the motion is TIMELY. 
 
Going to the merits
of the motion, Plaintiff argues Mr. Zemach was not properly qualified to
testify on Defendant’s behalf on the 63 Topics. Mr. Zemach testified that he
was the PMQ for only 16 out of the 93 topics and to date, Defendant has not
designated or produced for deposition any other person qualified to testify on
its behalf as to the outstanding topics. Moreover, Mr. Zemach was not
adequately prepared to testify at the deposition. Mr. Zemach’s testimony
demonstrates that he failed to review documents and other information
reasonably available to him in advance of his deposition. Plaintiff lastly
argues Defendant did not object to the Notice, including any of the Requests,
and did not produce a single document at the April 1 deposition. Moreover,
because Defendant did not serve any responses to the Notice, Plaintiff has no
way of knowing whether Defendant conducted a diligent search and reasonable
inquiry for each of the documents asked for in the Requests, or whether any of
the requested documents ever existed, or are no longer in Defendant’s
possession, custody or control because they were destroyed, lost, misplaced, or
stolen.
 
In opposition,
Defendant argues in May 2023, Defendant produced document nos. 1-934. On April
17, 2024, two weeks after the deposition, Defendant supplemented its document
production by producing documents nos. 935-1311. Accordingly, there are no
other responsive documents to produce. As for witnesses, Defendant contends at
the end of the deposition, Mr. Hanigan (counsel for Defendant) stated that
Defendant would produce David Zemach, Moshe’s son, to testify as to any matters
which were unknown by his father. However, due to calendar conflicts on all
sides, picking a mutually convenient date has been difficult.  Because Defendant has produced all responsive
documents in its possession, and has always been willing to produce David
Zemach for deposition, on a mutually convenient day for all parties and
counsel, Defendant contends the instant motion should be denied. 
 
Based on the record
before the court, the court compels the further deposition of Defendant’s PMQ.
It is not surprising an expansive PMQ request of 63 Topics could not be
answered by one individual. However, Defendant should have been aware of this
and conferred with Plaintiff that Moshe could not answer all 63 Topics. It
seems the parties dispute whether the April 29, 2024 date was actually
confirmed for David Zemach’s deposition. Regardless, Defendant has still failed
to produce David Zemach for deposition. Moreover, Mr. Zemach admitted to only
reviewing the interrogatories answered by him in preparation for the
deposition. 
 
The parties are to
work together to confirm what documents have already been produced and what
needs further production.  Defendant must
confirm whether a diligent search and reasonable inquiry has been done for all
responsive documents. Moreover, the court orders Mr. Moshe to be produced for
any remaining topics that he failed to answer that were in his purview and that
Zemach be produced on the remaining issues. 
 
Sanctions
 
Pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 2025.480(j), “[t]he court shall impose a monetary sanction…against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel an answer or production, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.”
 
Plaintiff requests
monetary sanctions in the amount of $18,725.00 against Defendant and its
counsel of record, jointly and severally, for having to bring the instant
motion for Defendant’s failure to provide a PMQ who was knowledgeable as to all
of the Topics or adequately prepared to testify. 
 
In opposition,
Defendant also seeks sanctions in the amount of $5,750.00 in connection with
opposing the motion. 
 
The court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $3,000.00 (5
hours preparing the motion, reviewing the opposition and preparing the reply at
Geylikman’s hourly rate of $600.). Mr. Geylikman does not describe what Ms.
Benyamin did on this motion. Moreover, Mr. Geylikman has not demonstrated Mr.
Foster’s work is not duplicative of Mr. Geylikman’s work. 
 
The court denies
Defendant’s request. Defendant has not demonstrated substantial justification
in opposing this motion.
