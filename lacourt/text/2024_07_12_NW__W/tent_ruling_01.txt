DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff requests for a change in jurisdiction for
the purposes of satisfying the judgment entered for Plaintiff Pearlie Kate
Miller and against Defendant Tiffany Warren on the grounds Ms. Warren is a
resident of Fairfield County, Ohio. 
 
This is not a basis for a motion to change
jurisdictions or transfer venue. The court has already entered judgment in
Plaintiff’s favor. If Plaintiff wishes to enforce the California judgment in
Ohio State (i.e., domesticate the California or “foreign state” judgment in
Ohio), Plaintiff will need to petition the Ohio State Court. The relevant
statutes in Ohio are outlined in Ohio Revised Code 2329.022 and 2329.023.
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Change Jurisdiction for Purposes of Collection of Judgment is DENIED.
