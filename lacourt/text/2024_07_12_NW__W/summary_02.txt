And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants Plaintiff's motion to compel further deposition of Defendant's PMQ, Moshe Zemach, and production of documents. The court finds that Defendant failed to produce a PMQ who is knowledgeable about all Topics, and has not conducted a diligent search and reasonable inquiry for all responsive documents. The court orders Defendant to produce David Zemach for deposition and to confirm what documents have already been produced and what needs further production. The court also awards Plaintiff $3,000.00 in sanctions and denies Defendant's request for sanctions of $5,750.00. The court notes that Defendant's failure to produce a PMQ who is knowledgeable about all Topics and to conduct a diligent search and reasonable inquiry for all responsive documents has caused unnecessary delay and expense to the litigation.
