Significant Statements:

(Miller v. Fortune Commercial Corporation (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 214, 228-29.)
  - "Whether a defendant's conduct can reasonably be found to be outrageous is a question of law that must initially be determined by the court; if reasonable persons may differ, it is for the jury to determine whether the conduct was, in fact, outrageous." (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 534.)
```

And here is the English text to summarize the Judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's third cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The court finds that the plaintiff's allegations of unfair performance improvement plans and termination do not constitute outrageous conduct, but rather are personnel management decisions that are essential to the welfare and prosperity of society. The court holds that the worker's compensation laws do not preempt the plaintiff's claim, but also finds that the plaintiff's allegations of intentional infliction of emotional distress lack any outrageous conduct. The court has given the plaintiff 30 days to amend their complaint to cure the defects.
