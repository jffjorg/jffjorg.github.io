And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants Defendant Mason Electric Company, Inc.'s motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Plaintiff Hexadyne Corporation. The cross-complaint alleges six causes of action, including breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, concealment, intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and false promise. The court finds that the claims are compulsory and related to the underlying contract. The court also finds that Defendant has not acted in bad faith and that the addition of the cross-claims is unlikely to significantly expand discovery. The court grants the motion, allowing the cross-complaint to proceed.
