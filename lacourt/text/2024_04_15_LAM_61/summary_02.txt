And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants Plaintiff John N. Drooyan's motion to compel further responses from Defendant Marathon HVAC Service regarding photos and videos taken during a site inspection of Plaintiff's property. Plaintiff sought disclosure of all photos and videos taken by Defendant's counsel or agents during the inspection. Defendant objected to the requests based on privilege and work-product. The court found that the work-product doctrine may not apply in this case, as the inspection was conducted in full view of the adverse party. The court also found that Plaintiff was not seeking a strategic selection of the photos or videos, but rather all photos taken during the inspection. The court granted the motion to compel further responses. The court also denied Plaintiff's request for sanctions, as Plaintiff is representing himself and therefore cannot seek attorney's fees.
