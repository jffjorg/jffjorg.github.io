 Case Number:  23STCV26131    Hearing Date:   April 15, 2024    Dept:  61 I.                  
DEMURRER
A demurrer should be sustained only where the defects appear
on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Code Civ. Pro., §§
430.30, et seq.) In particular, as is
relevant here, a court should sustain a demurrer if a complaint does not allege
facts that are legally sufficient to constitute a cause of action. (See
id. § 430.10, subd. (e).) As the Supreme Court held in Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311:
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but
not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. . . . Further, we
give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its
parts in their context.” (Id. at
p. 318; see also Hahn. v. Mirda
(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747 [“A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not
the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.
[Citation.]”) 
 
“In determining whether the complaint is sufficient as
against the demurrer … if on consideration of all the facts stated it appears
the plaintiff is entitled to any relief at the hands of the court against the
defendants the complaint will be held good although the facts may not be
clearly stated.”  (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 639.)
 
“A demurrer
for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some
respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of Cal., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612,
616.) Such demurrers “are disfavored,
and are granted only if the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant
cannot reasonably respond.” (Mahan v.
Charles W. Chan Insurance Agency, Inc. (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 841, 848.)
 
A demurrer should not be sustained without leave to amend if
the complaint, liberally construed, can state a cause of action under any
theory or if there is a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured by
amendment. (Schifando v. City of Los Angeles, supra, 31 Cal.4th at p.
1081.) The demurrer also may be sustained without leave to amend where the
nature of the defects and previous unsuccessful attempts to plead render it
probable plaintiff cannot state a cause of action. (Krawitz v. Rusch
(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 957, 967.)
 
Defendants Huntsman Advanced Materials Americas LLC,
Huntsman International LLC, and David Jarquin (Defendants) demurrer to
Plaintiff Jose Irizarry’s third cause of action for intentional infliction of
emotional distress (IIED) on the grounds that it is preempted by the worker’s
compensation laws, and further fails to allege outrageous conduct. (Demurrer at
pp. 3–6.) 
 
The appellate courts are in
disagreement as to whether the worker’s compensation laws preempt claims for
IIED based on alleged retaliatory or discriminatory misconduct. Defendants rely
on Jones v. Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 1367, 1382, in which the court held a claim for IIED based on
discriminatory conduct to be preempted: “Even if the discriminatory conduct
Jones complained about “may be characterized as intentional, unfair or
outrageous, it is nevertheless covered by the workers' compensation exclusivity
provisions.” (Ibid.) However, other courts have held otherwise: “[W]e
are unwilling to abandon the long-standing view that unlawful discrimination
and retaliation in violation of FEHA falls outside the compensation bargain and
therefore claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress based on such
discrimination and retaliation are not subject to workers' compensation
exclusivity.” (Light v. Department of Parks & Recreation (2017) 14
Cal.App.5th 75, 101.)
The IIED claim here is not barred by worker’s compensation
exclusivity, because, similar to the holding of Light, unlawful
retaliation in violation of Labor Code § 1102.5 is not within the ordinary
compensation bargain.
However, Defendants are correct
that no outrageous conduct is alleged.  “The
elements of a prima facie case for the tort of intentional infliction of
emotional distress are: (1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant
with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of
causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff's suffering severe or extreme
emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of the emotional
distress by the defendant's outrageous conduct.” (Miller v. Fortune Commercial Corporation (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 214,
228–29.) “Whether a defendant’s conduct
can reasonably be found to be outrageous
is a question of law that must initially be determined by the court; if reasonable
persons may differ, it is for the jury to determine whether the conduct was, in fact, outrageous.” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 534.)
 
The conduct alleged by Plaintiff here consists solely of
unfair performance improvement plans and his ultimate termination. (Complaint
¶¶ 33–35.) These allegations constitute only personnel-management decisions.
 
Managing personnel is not outrageous conduct
beyond the bounds of human decency, but rather conduct essential to the welfare
and prosperity of society. A simple pleading of personnel management activity
is insufficient to support a claim of intentional infliction of emotional
distress, even if improper motivation is alleged. If personnel management
decisions are improperly motivated, the remedy is a suit against the employer
for discrimination.
(Janken
v. GM Hughes Electronics (1996) 46
Cal.App.4th 55, 80.)
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer is SUSTAINED as to the third cause of action with 30 days leave to
amend.
