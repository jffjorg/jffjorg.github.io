And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion of defendants John Zhong and Catherine Li to set aside (vacate) the judgment of the preliminary injunction granted to the City of Diamond Bar. The court also strikes the cross-complaint filed by Zhong and Li as untimely and without leave to amend. The court's decision is based on the fact that the preliminary injunction is the subject of a pending appeal and the court lacks jurisdiction to hear the motion to set aside (vacate) the same order. Additionally, the cross-complaint was filed 122 days after the defendants filed their answer to the City's complaint, which is beyond the time limit specified in the Code of Civil Procedure.
