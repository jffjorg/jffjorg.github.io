And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Guruaan LA Real Estate Inc.'s motion to vacate default. The court finds that the motion is timely and that there was a mistake, inadvertence, or surprise that led to the default. The court notes that Guruaan LA Real Estate Inc.'s owner, Gurvinder Aujla, did not receive the papers served on his company and only became aware of the lawsuit in September 2023. The court also notes that the plaintiff, Luis Marquez, has failed to file a timely opposition. Based on these facts, the court grants Guruaan LA Real Estate Inc.'s motion to vacate default and deems the proposed answer submitted with the motion as filed.
