And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Merchants Automotive Group, Inc.'s (MAG) motion to strike punitive damages from Plaintiff Anna Perez's Complaint. The motion is granted with 30 days' leave to amend. The Judge finds that the Complaint lacks sufficient allegations to support a claim of punitive damages against MAG, as it failed to allege how MAG had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee, Dorothy Doe, or how MAG ratified or authorized Doe's conduct in the alleged hit-and-run.
