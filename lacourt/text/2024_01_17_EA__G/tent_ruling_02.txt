 Case Number:  22STCV10734    Hearing Date:   January 17, 2024    Dept:  G Defendant Bonita Unified School District’s Motion for  Judgment on the Pleadings Respondent: Plaintiff T.C. TENTATIVE RULING Defendant Bonita Unified School District’s Motion for  Judgment on the Pleadings is DENIED. BACKGROUND This  action arises from the alleged sexual abuse of a middle school student by  school staff. From 1978 to 1979, Plaintiff T.C. was a student attending Ramona  Middle School in La Verne which was operated and controlled by Defendant Bonita  Unified School District (BUSD). During T.C.’s time at Ramona Middle School,  T.C. alleges Roy Redifer, a history teacher employed by BUSD, sexually abused  T.C. by groping T.C.’s genitals. T.C. also alleges BUSD was made aware of  Redifer’s sexual abuse and failed to take any action to protect T.C. On  March 29, 2022, T.C. filed a complaint against Does 1-25, alleging the  following causes of action: (1) negligence; (2) negligence; (3) negligent  hiring, retention, and supervision; and (4) negligent hiring, retention, and  supervision. On  June 3, 2022, T.C. filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against BUSD and Does  2-25, alleging the same causes of action. On  November 10, 2022, T.C. filed a Second Amended Complaint (SAC) against the same  defendants alleging the same causes of action. On October  26, 2023, BUSD filed the present motion. On November 22, the court continued  the hearing on BUSD’s motion for parties to further meet and confer. On  December 11, BUSD’s counsel telephonically met and conferred with T.C.’s  counsel. (Tourkow Decl., ¶ 4.) A hearing on  the present motion is set for January 17, 2024. REQUESTS FOR JUDICIAL  NOTICE T.C.’s request for judicial  notice of California State Assembly records is GRANTED pursuant to Evidence  Code section 452, subdivision (c). But to the extent T.C. and BUSD both request  judicial notice of trial court orders in other cases, those requests are DENIED  as they are neither precedent nor binding authority for this court. (B.F. v.  Superior Court (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 621, 627, fn. 2.) ANALYSIS BUSD  moves for judgment on the pleadings as to T.C.’s entire SAC on the grounds that  AB 218 violates article 16, section 6 of the California Constitution. For the  following reasons, the court DENIES BUSD’s motion. Legal Standard A defendant may move for judgment on the  pleadings when the “complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a  cause of action against that defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd.  (c)(1)(B)(ii).) “A motion for judgment on the pleadings is akin to a general  demurrer; it tests the sufficiency of the complaint to state a cause of action.  [Citation.] The court must assume the truth of all factual allegations in the  complaint, along with matters subject to judicial notice.” (Wise v. Pacific  Gas & Electric Co. (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 725, 738.) Discussion In  2019, the California Legislature passed AB 218 and it was signed into law.  (Stats. 2019, ch.  861.) As relevant here, it amended Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1 to add  a subdivision (q) which allows a childhood sexual assault claim that would have  been time-barred as of January 1, 2020, to be brought within three years of  January 1, 2020. (Stats. 2019, ch. 861, § 1.) AB 218 also amended Government Code  section 905, subdivision (m), which excludes childhood sexual assault claims  from notice of claim requirements by removing language that made the statute  only applicable “to claims arising out of conduct occurring on or after January  1, 2009” and making such changes retroactive. (Compare Stats. 2019, ch. 861, § 3, with Stats.  2012, ch. 776, § 2.) BUSD  argues this amendment violates article 16, section 6 of the California  Constitution[1] which provides in relevant  part: “The Legislature shall have no power to give or to lend, or to authorize  the giving or lending . . . in any manner whatever, for the payment of the  liabilities of any individual, association, municipal or other corporation  whatever; nor shall it have power to make any gift or authorize the making of  any gift, of any public money or thing of value to any individual, municipal or  other corporation whatever . . . .” Our  supreme court has consistently interpreted the gift clause to prevent the  Legislature from retroactively creating liability for public agencies. In Bourn  v. Hart (1892) 93 Cal. 321, the Legislature passed legislation that  provided compensation for a state prison guard who had been previously injured.  (Id., at p. 326.) The supreme court held the legislation violated the  gift clause because the state was not liable for the guard’s injury “either  upon general principles of law or by reason of some previous statute creating  such liability” at the time of the injury. (Id., at p. 328.) Since  that case, the supreme court has held “[a]n appropriation of money by the  legislature for the relief of one who has no legal claim therefor must be  regarded as a gift” pursuant to the gift clause. (Conlin v. Board of  Supervisors (1893) 99 Cal. 17, 21-22 (Conlin); see Chapman v.  State (1894) 104 Cal. 690, 693 (Chapman) [holding gift clause denies  Legislature “power to create a liability against the state for any such  past act of negligence upon the part of its officers.”]; Powell v. Phelan (1903)  138 Cal. 271, 273-274 (Powell) [holding law appropriating money to  jurors for past jury service was gift because they were not entitled to  compensation at time they served]; Heron v. Riley (1930) 209 Cal. 507,  517 (Heron) [holding the Legislature cannot “create a liability against  the state for any past acts of negligence on the part of its officers, agents  or employees”]; see also Jordan v. California Dept. of Motor Vehicles (2002)  100 Cal.App.4th 431, 450, citing Conlin, supra, 99 Cal. At p.  21-22.) Relying  on these authorities, BUSD argues AB 218 violates the gift clause because it  imposes liability on public entities for past incidents where there was  previously no liability. With regards to claim presentation requirements, our  supreme court has held they are “more than a procedural requirement” and are  “an integral part of plaintiff’s cause of action” that must be satisfied before  a cause of action can be maintained. (State of California v. Superior Court (2004)  32 Cal.4th 1234, 1240, quoting Williams v. Horvath (1976) 16 Cal.3d 834,  842.) But in this case, the court finds changes to claim presentation  requirements do not violate the gift clause. In Chapman, our supreme  court distinguished the creation of a remedy from the creation of a liability.  There, the plaintiff brought an action against the state for negligence after a  cargo of coal was lost during the collapse of a public wharf in San Francisco.  (Chapman, supra, 104 Cal. at p. 692.) While plaintiff brought the  action pursuant to an 1893 law that allowed negligence actions against the  state, the state argued it was not liable for the accident which occurred  before the passage of the 1893 law. (Id., at p. 693.) In Chapman,  our supreme court noted the 1893 law did not create liability for the state as  the state was already liable pursuant to the principles of contract law. (Id.,  at p. 696.) Instead, the court held the 1893 law “merely gave an additional  remedy for the enforcement of such liability.” (Ibid.) In holding so,  the court quoted the following language from a New York case: “The  fact that the state is not subject to an action [on] behalf of a citizen does  not establish that he has no claim against the state, or that no liability  exists from the state to him. It only shows that he cannot enforce against the  state his claim, and make it answer in a court of law for its liability. What  is made out by this objection is not that there is no liability and no claim,  but that there is no remedy.” (Ibid, quoting Coster v. City of Albany  (N.Y. 1871) 43 N.Y. 399, 407-408.) This  distinction is well recognized in California as courts have held the state’s  consent to suit is not a waiver of the state’s immunity from liability. (See,  e.g., Quigley v. Garden Valley Fire Protection Dist. (2019) 7  Cal.5th 798, 811 [noting the court has “rejected the idea that the Legislature,  by offering the state’s consent to suit, also intended to eliminate the state’s  substantive immunity from liability.”]; People ex rel. Dept. of Parks and  Recreation v. West-A-Rama, Inc. (1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 786, 794 [noting claim  statutes are simply notice requirements and do not waive state’s sovereign  immunity].) In  the authorities that BUSD relied on, this distinction also appears. For  example, in Bourn, our supreme court noted as follows: “The  exemption of the state from paying damages for accidents of this nature does  not depend upon its immunity from being sued without its consent, but rests  upon grounds of public policy which deny its liability for such damages. . . . The appropriation made to  petitioner was a mere gratuitous assumption of an obligation from which the  state was and is exempt, and is within the mischief which the framers of the  constitution intended to remedy by the sections before referred to.” (Bourn,  supra, 93 Cal. at p. 328.) In  other words, the court in Bourn distinguished between the state’s  ability to consent to suit and the state’s immunity from liability for the type  of injury suffered by plaintiff. Similarly, in Conlin, the court noted  that the Legislature’s attempt to provide a remedy for unpaid contracts was a  gift because the legislation itself admitted the state had no legal obligation  to pay plaintiff. (Conlin, supra, 99 Cal. at p. 22.) And in Powell,  the court noted the state was under no legal obligation to pay jurors. (Powell,  supra, 138 Cal. at p. 273-274.) In  the present case, AB 218 does not violate the gift clause by retroactively  creating liabilities for BUSD. Instead, such liability is created by Government  Code section 820, subdivision (a), which states “[e]xcept as otherwise provided by  statute (including Section 820.2), a public employee is liable for injury  caused by his act or omission to the same extent as a private person.” In  retroactively adjusting claim presentation requirements, AB 218 has merely  expanded the remedies available to T.C. Thus, because AB 218 does not create  liability for BUSD and instead addresses the remedies available to T.C., it  does not meet the definition of an unconstitutional gift that violates the  California Constitution’s gift clause. Accordingly, BUSD’s  motion is DENIED. CONCLUSION Based  on the foregoing, BUSD’s motion for judgment on the  pleadings is DENIED.
