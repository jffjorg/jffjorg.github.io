The court has denied the Bonita Unified School District's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The motion was filed in response to a complaint alleging sexual abuse by a history teacher at Ramona Middle School. The plaintiff, T.C., alleges that the school district was aware of the abuse and failed to take action.

The court has also held that the creation of a remedy does not create a liability, and that the school district's motion was properly denied.
