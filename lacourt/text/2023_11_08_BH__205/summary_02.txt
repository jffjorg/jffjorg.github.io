Additionally, the judge's tentative ruling can be summarized in English text as follows:

The Court has reviewed the demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint filed by Defendant Niv Levy and has made the following decisions:

* The demurrer to the breach of contract claim is sustained because the Plaintiff has failed to allege specific terms of the purported oral agreement, particularly the amount of compensation due Defendant.
* The demurrer to the unfair business practices claim is sustained because the Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged an unlawful, unfair or fraudulent act or the type of relief available under the UCL.
* The demurrer to the entire Complaint is overruled because the allegations are not uncertain and can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.

The Court overrules the demurrer to the fraud claim because the Plaintiff has made sufficient allegations that Defendant made false representations and that Plaintiff relied on those representations.

The Court sustains the demurrer to the breach of contract claim without leave to amend.
