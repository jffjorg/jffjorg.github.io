Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in two separate motions. The first motion is from Plaintiff Richard Lee, who is seeking to approve a proposed judgment in favor of himself and against the Defendants. The judge has denied this motion because it seeks to dispose of the case piecemeal, and the issue of legal ownership and title has not been fully resolved.

The second motion is from Plaintiff Toni Kopek, who is seeking to sever and try separately the remaining causes of action in the Defendants' cross-complaint. The judge has granted this motion because the remaining causes of action involve purely equitable issues, such as declaratory relief and quiet title, which should be tried first before any jury trial on the Plaintiffs' claims. The judge has discretion to order a severance of trials, and in this case, it is necessary to preserve the right to a jury trial and to promote judicial efficiency and economy.
