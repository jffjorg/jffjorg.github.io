 Case Number:  23SMCV00517    Hearing Date:   November 8, 2023    Dept:  205 HEARING DATE:  November 7, 2023 JUDGE/DEPT:  Moreton/Beverly Hills, 205 CASE NAME: Network Experts Inc. v. Beverly Hills IT Services, et al.  CASE NUMBER:  23SMCV00517  COMP. FILED:  February 3, 2023    PROCEEDINGS:  REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT MOVING PARTY:  Network Experts, Inc.  RESPONDING PARTY: Beverly Hills IT Services and Beverly Hills IT  BACKGROUND This is theft of trade secrets case.  Plaintiff Network Experts provides computer sales, consulting and IT services.  Defendant Mostafa Karbalei Ahmad Baboli (“Baboli”) was employed by Plaintiff to serve as an IT specialist/director.    Baboli later formed Beverly Hills IT Services and Beverly Hills Services (the “Entity Defendants” and together with Baboli, “Defendants”) which then contracted with Plaintiff to perform IT services.  Baboli informed Plaintiff that the Entity Defendants would contract with Plaintiff as an independent contractor, servicing Plaintiff’s clients, while also servicing the Entity Defendants’ own clients as well.    Plaintiff claims Defendants misappropriated its trade secrets to poach Plaintiff’s clients for their competitive business.  Plaintiff also claims Baboli borrowed $9,540 pursuant to a promissory note which he has failed to repay.    The operative complaint alleges claims for (1) misappropriation of trade secrets, (2) breach of promissory note, (3) breach of fiduciary duty, (4) breach of duty of loyalty, (5) unfair competition, (6) intentional interference with prospective economic relations, (7) negligent interference with prospective economic relations, (8) conversion and (9) trespass to chattel.  The complaint seeks unspecified damages, interest, attorney’s fees and costs.      This hearing is on Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment against the Entity Defendants.  Plaintiff served the Entity Defendants by substitute service on February 8, 2023.  Service is deemed completed on the 10th day after mailing, which is February 19, 2023.  Defendants’ response to the Complaint was due by March 21, 2023.  Defendants failed to respond.  Accordingly, default was entered against the Entity Defendants on April 27, 2023.         RELIEF REQUESTED  Default judgment against Defendant for a total of $2,094,298.47 consisting of (1) $118,057.83 in special damages, (2) $1,903,907.70 in punitive damages, (3) $19,736.29 in prejudgment interest at 10% per annum, (4) $51,618.65 in attorneys’ fees, and (5) $978 in costs.   ANALYSIS  Code of Civil Procedure section 585 sets forth the two options for obtaining a default judgment. First, where the plaintiff’s complaint¿seeks compensatory damages only, in a sum certain which is readily ascertainable from the allegations of the complaint or statement of damages, the clerk may enter the default judgment for that amount. However, if the relief requested in the complaint is more complicated, consisting of either nonmonetary relief, or monetary relief in amounts which require either an accounting, additional evidence, or the exercise of judgment to ascertain, the plaintiff must request entry of judgment by the court. In such cases, the plaintiff must affirmatively establish his entitlement to the specific judgment requested.¿ (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 287.) Section 585 also allows for interest, costs and attorney fees, where otherwise allowed by law. (Code of Civ. Proc.  585(a).)  Multiple specific documents are required, such as: (1) form CIV 100, (2) a brief summary of the case; (3) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (4) interest computations as necessary; (5) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (CRC Rule 3.1800.)  Here, Plaintiff has not complied with the requirements for a default judgment.  Plaintiff’s complaint does not specify any damages.  The relief granted to a plaintiff on a request for entry of default judgment “cannot exceed that which [is] demanded in [the] complaint . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc. § 580.)¿ Section 580¿exists to insure that a defaulting defendant has adequate notice of the judgment that might (and probably will) be entered against him, and to permit an enlightened decision about whether to appear and defend or to give up that right “in exchange for the certainty that he cannot be held liable for more than a known amount.” (Ely v. Gray¿(1990) 224 Cal. App. 3d 1257, 1261;¿In re Marriage of Lippel¿(1990) 51 Cal. 3d 1160, 1166;¿Greenup v. Rodman¿(1986) 42 Cal. 3d 822, 826.)  It follows that the amount of damages communicated to the defaulting defendant sets the ceiling on the plaintiff's recovery, and that a default judgment in excess of that amount is void.  (Schwab v. Rondel Homes, Inc. (1991) 53 Cal. 3d 428, 433;¿Greenup v. Rodman,¿ 42 Cal. 3d at 824.)  In addition, Plaintiff seeks punitive damages.  To do so, Plaintiff was required to serve a statement of damages with the amount of punitive damages it is seeking before entry of default.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 425.115.)  There is no indication Plaintiff ever served a statement of damages on the Entity Defendants.     Finally, Plaintiff’s proposed judgment seeks default against Baboli in addition to the Entity Defendants.  The Court has set aside the entry of default against Baboli and accordingly, he should not be included in any proposed judgment.    CONCLUSION AND ORDER   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff Network Express Inc.’s Request for Default Judgment is DENIED as to Defendants Beverly Hills IT Services and Beverly Hills IT.
