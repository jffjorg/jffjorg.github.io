The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Michael Adam Cadena (Plaintiff) vs. Sharon Ibara and Randy Ibara (Defendants). The case arises from a motor vehicle vs. pedestrian accident that occurred on October 12, 2022. The Defendants served discovery requests on the Plaintiff, but the Plaintiff failed to respond in a timely manner. Despite granting extensions, the Plaintiff still did not provide the requested information, and the Defendants filed a motion to compel discovery responses. The Judge has denied the motion as moot since the discovery responses were eventually provided. However, the Judge has awarded sanctions in the amount of $330 to the Defendants, which includes $270 for defense counsel's hourly rate and $60 in filing fees. The Plaintiff is required to pay the sanctions within 20 days of the date of the order.
