And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for a protective order filed by Ford Motor Company (Defendant) in a lawsuit brought by Jose Rodriguez (Plaintiff). The motion seeks to protect confidential materials produced during discovery, including Warranty Policy & Procedure Manuals, Customer Relationship Center Policies and Procedures, and Reacquired Vehicle Policy and Procedures Manuals.

The judge has granted the motion in part, finding that Defendant has demonstrated "good cause" to protect the confidential information. The judge has also modified the proposed protective order to allow attorneys who are affiliated with the same firm as the attorneys of record to access the confidential information, and to require non-lawyer employees to sign a certification before accessing the information. The judge has rejected some of Defendant's proposed modifications, including a prohibition on disseminating confidential information to mock jury participants and a requirement that Plaintiff's counsel return or destroy all confidential documents at the conclusion of the case.

The judge has ordered Defendant to submit a proposed order incorporating the Court's ruling into the Los Angeles Superior Court's Model Order. The parties are advised to submit on the tentative ruling by email to the Court and to assume that the opposing party may appear at the hearing to argue the matter.
