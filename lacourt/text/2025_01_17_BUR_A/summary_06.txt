And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is on six motions brought by the defendant, Hai Van Le, to compel further responses to discovery requests from the plaintiffs, Clarissa Esther Avila-Garduno and Karla Nancy Garduno Hernandez. The motions relate to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents (RFPD) served on the plaintiffs on June 3, 2024. The plaintiffs failed to verify their responses, which were served on August 12, 2024.

The judge finds that the plaintiffs' failure to verify their responses has resulted in an effective failure to respond, and that the defendant's motions are more akin to a motion to compel initial responses than a motion to compel further responses. The judge grants the motions and orders the plaintiffs to serve verified and objection-free responses to the discovery requests. The judge also awards sanctions against the plaintiffs in the amount of $1,321.02 for their failure to respond timely and verify their responses.

The judge notes that the plaintiffs' failure to communicate with their counsel and provide verified discovery responses is unjustified and that the plaintiffs cannot avoid the imposition of discovery sanctions. The judge orders the plaintiffs to serve the verified responses no later than February 14, 2024.
