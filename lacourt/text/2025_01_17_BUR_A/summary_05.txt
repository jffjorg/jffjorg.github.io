And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition to confirm the arbitration award. The petitioners, David Minkin and Jessica Peterson, sought to confirm an arbitration award related to an uninsured motorist claim. The respondent, United Financial Casualty Company, opposed the petition, arguing that no arbitration award was ever made.

The court found that the parties reached a settlement prior to entering arbitration and that no arbitration award was ever made. As a result, the petition is defective and must be denied. The court also noted that the dispute regarding costs and prejudgment interest is properly resolved by the arbitrator, not the court.

The court's ruling is based on the California Civil Procedure Code, the California Insurance Code, and the Briggs v. Resolution Remedies case. The court's decision is final unless a party requests a hearing or files a written opposition to the tentative ruling.
