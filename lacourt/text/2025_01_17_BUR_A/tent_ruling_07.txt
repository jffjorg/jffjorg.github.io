COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY

Los Angeles Superior Court
Case # 24NNCV00360

 



MP:  


Alex Rosales Hernandez (Plaintiff) 




RP:  


Ford Motor Company (Defendant)



 
NOTICE:
 

The Court is
requesting oral argument on this matter to address whether the parties complied
with the Court’s January 2, 2025 orders concerning further meeting and confer
relative to the protective order.  
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Alex Rosales
Hernandez (Plaintiff) brings this action against Ford
Motor Company (Ford). Plaintiff alleges that Ford sold him a defective 2022
Ford F-150 (Subject Vehicle) and thereafter declined to repurchase the vehicle
in violation of the Song-Beverly Act. 
 
Before
the Court are two motions to compel further responses to Plaintiff’s Request
for the Production of Documents (RFPD) and Special Interrogatories. 
 
On
October 25, 2024, these motions came on for hearing. The Court found that
Plaintiff had failed to demonstrate good faith meet and confer efforts prior to
the brining of this motion. The Court ordered the parties to further meet and
confer and continued the motions to December 20, 2024. To the extent that it
was necessary, Ford was ordered to file supplemental briefing as to the
protective order no later than December 6, 2024. Any responsive briefing from
Plaintiff was due no later than December 11, 2024. 
 
Ford did
not file supplemental briefing by the ordered deadline. On December 11, 2024,
despite the fact that Ford had filed no further briefings Plaintiff filed a
short responsive brief. On December 19, 2024, Ford filed a separately noticed
Motion for Protective Order to be heard March 7, 2025. 
 
On
December 20, 2024, these motions were continued once more to January 2, 2025 as
a result of scheduling conflict in the Court’s calendar. On January 2, 2025,
the Court again ordered Ford to provide Plaintiff a copy of the proposed
protective order no later than three court days from the January 2nd
order.  The Court is unaware that this
was completed.  The Court does not know
whether Plaintiff’s counsel has reviewed the proposed changes to the protective
order which were incorporated in Ford’s motion for protective order filed
December 19, 2024.
 
Appearances
of counsel will be required to provide further information.
