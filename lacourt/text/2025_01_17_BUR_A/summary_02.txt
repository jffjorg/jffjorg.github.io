And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a motion to compel the deposition of Defendant Lucille Mary Schermerhorn. The Plaintiff, Gibraltar Convalescent Hospital, brought the motion after Defendant failed to appear at a noticed deposition and did not object to the notice. The judge finds that the Plaintiff has demonstrated that Defendant was properly served with notice of the deposition, failed to object to the notice, failed to appear at the noticed deposition, and did not respond to the Plaintiff's inquiry about alternative dates. As a result, the judge grants the motion to compel Defendant's attendance at deposition, which must occur no later than January 31, 2025, or a later date agreed upon by the parties. The judge also denies sanctions, finding that Defendant's conduct was not malicious or intentional, but rather an attempt to reschedule the deposition.
