Here is a summary in English:

The tentative ruling grants plaintiff's application for a writ of attachment in the reduced amount of $35,131.18, subject to plaintiff posting a $10,000.00 undertaking within 30 days. The court sets an Order to Show Cause for posting the undertaking on April 17, 2024. The writ of attachment is granted to secure the recovery of a debt owed by defendants.

The court denies plaintiff's application for a writ of possession without prejudice. The writ of possession was sought for certain equipment, but the court found that plaintiff failed to comply with certain statutory requirements.
