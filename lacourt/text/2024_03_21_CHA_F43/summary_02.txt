And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Lauren A Landau, counsel of record for Plaintiff Matilde Ortiz. The motion was filed due to an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, which has made it impossible for counsel to continue representing the plaintiff effectively. Since there is no showing of resulting prejudice, the judge has determined that the attorney's request for withdrawal should be granted, in accordance with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362 and the precedent set in People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406. The moving party is required to give notice of the ruling.
