And here is the summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer to the Cross-Complaint filed by Triscenic Production Services, Inc. (Cross-Defendant) against Maurice Starrantino and Karen G. Starrantino (Cross-Complainants) is sustained without leave to amend. The Cross-Complaint alleges that Cross-Defendant breached its lease agreement with Cross-Complainants by sub-letting property without their permission. However, the Judge finds that the claims are barred by the General Release in a Settlement Agreement signed by Cross-Complainants and Cross-Defendant in 2022. The General Release releases Cross-Defendant from all claims, demands, and obligations. The Judge also finds that the causes of action for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and for violations of the Business and Professions Code are not sustained because they do not state a claim.
