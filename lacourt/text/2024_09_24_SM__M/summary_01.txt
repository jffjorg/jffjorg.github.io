And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Rosamond Ranch LP v. South La Cienega Holdings LLC, et al. The ruling addresses a motion for terminating sanctions filed by the Cross-Defendants, who are seeking to strike the complaint of the Plaintiff/Cross-Defendants and strike the answer of the Cross-Defendants to the cross-complaint.

The Judge finds that the Cross-Defendants have engaged in a pattern of discovery abuse, including failing to comply with court orders, destroying or concealing evidence, producing excessive documents, and failing to produce all responsive documents. The Judge concludes that the Cross-Defendants' discovery abuse was willful and intentional, and that lesser sanctions have not been effective in curbing their misconduct.

The Judge is inclined to grant terminating sanctions against the Plaintiff's operative complaint against the Cross-Defendants, as well as against the Cross-Defendants' answer to the cross-complaint. The Judge is also inclined to award monetary sanctions in the amount of $50,235.00 against the Cross-Defendants Elias Shokrian, Rosamond Ranch LP, and Calitex LLC, with 50% of the sanction ($25,117.50) to be jointly and severally payable against counsel of record, Charles Gomez of Gomez Law APC.

The Judge notes that the case will be set for further proceedings to discuss the implementation of the sanctions, and that the parties will have an opportunity to file supplemental briefing on specific issues.
