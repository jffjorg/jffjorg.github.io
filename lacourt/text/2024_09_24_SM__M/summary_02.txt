**Summary in English text:**

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Prang's petition for reconsideration of the Assessment Appeals Board's decision regarding the valuation of the property. The Judge finds that the Board's decision is not arbitrary, capricious, or entirely lacking in evidentiary support. The Judge also concludes that the Assessment Appeals Board's decision not to disturb the valuation of the property at $3.7 million is supported by law. The Judge finds that the Assessor's erroneous determination did not involve an exercise of judgment as to value, but rather was a mechanical or clerical error. Therefore, the petition is denied.
