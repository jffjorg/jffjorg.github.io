And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further responses to interrogatories. The Plaintiffs, Mario Parrales and Marlene Parrales, filed the lawsuit on May 15, 2023, alleging that the Defendant, FCA US LLC, breached the Song-Beverly Act and that the Defendant, Russell Westbrook Chrysler Dodge Jeep RAM of Van Nuys, was negligent in repairing a 2016 Jeep Cherokee. The Plaintiffs moved for an order compelling further responses to their interrogatories and for sanctions against the Defendant and its counsel.

The Judge finds that the motion should be denied as moot with respect to compelling further responses since the Defendant provided further responses after the filing of the motion. However, the Judge does not find this motion moot with respect to sanctions. The Judge is inclined to award at least some sanctions against the Defendant and its counsel for their failure to provide compliant responses to the interrogatories.

The Judge notes that the Defendant failed to provide compliant responses to the interrogatories, and that the Plaintiffs were forced to meet and confer to resolve the issues. The Judge also notes that the Defendant provided amended responses and supplemental responses after the filing of the motion, but that these responses did not address all of the issues raised by the Plaintiffs.

The Judge will hear argument on the motion and will determine whether to award sanctions against the Defendant and its counsel.
