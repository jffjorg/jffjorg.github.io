TENTATIVE
RULING ON MOTIONS TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs,
Mario Parrales and Marlene Parrales, filed the instant lawsuit on 5/15/2023. 
The first cause of action is labeled as “Violation of
Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty” and is alleged against
Defendant, FCA US LLC. As to the first cause of action, Plaintiffs allege they
entered into a warranty contract with FCA US LLC regarding a 2016 Jeep
Cherokee.
The second cause of action is labeled as “Negligent
Repair” and is alleged against Defendant, Russell Westbrook Chrysler Dodge Jeep
RAM of Van Nuys. 
RELIEF REQUESTED
“Plaintiffs
will, and hereby do, move the Court for an order compelling further responses
to Plaintiffs’ Special Interrogatories and for monetary sanctions in the amount
of $2,610.00 against Defendant FCA US LLC and its attorneys of record, Ongaro
PC.
This
motion is made on the grounds that Defendant FCA US LLC has not provided
Code-compliant responses to Plaintiffs’ Special Interrogatories numbers 45-48,
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (e) and
2023.030, subdivision (g).)
This
motion is based upon the Memorandum of Points and Authorities attached hereto,
the Declaration of Zachary Powell, the Separate Statement of Issues in Dispute,

were served by email to sgrimsrud@ongaropc.com. However, a notice of

12/12/2024. This notice of continuance was not served to sgrimsrud@ongaropc.com
and was instead served only to sshepardson@ongaropc.com. The email address of
sshepardson@ongaropc.com is not listed on eCourt as Defendant’s counsel’s email

LEGAL
STANDARD - COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO INTERROGATORIES
Under CCP § 2017.010, “any party may
obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject
matter involved in the pending action..., if the matter either is itself
admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence.”  The
Section specifically provides that “[d]iscovery may relate to the claim or
defense of the party seeking discovery or of any other party to the action,”
and that discovery “may be obtained of the identity and location of persons
having knowledge of any discoverable matter, as well as of the existence,
description, nature, custody, condition and location of any document,
electronically stored information, tangible thing, or land or other property.”
On receipt of a
response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of the
following apply:
(1)   An answer to a particular interrogatory is
evasive or incomplete.
(2)   An exercise of the option to produce documents
under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those
documents is inadequate.
(3)   An objection to an interrogatory is without
merit or too general.
(CCP § 2030.300(a).
If a timely motion to compel has been filed,
the¿burden is on the responding party¿to justify any objection or failure fully
to answer.¿(Coy v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (1962) 58
Cal.2d 210, 220–221 [addressing a motion to compel further responses to
interrogatories]; see also¿Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court¿(2000) 22
Cal.4th 245, 255.)  
“While the party propounding interrogatories may have
the burden of filing a motion to compel if it finds the answers it receives
unsatisfactory, the burden of justifying any objection and failure to respond
remains at all times with the party resisting an interrogatory.” (Williams
v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 541 citing Coy v. Superior Court
(1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-221.)
Furthermore, to the extent there is any doubt in
whether these records should be discoverable, California’s liberal approach to
discovery provides that doubt should be resolved in favor of permitting
discovery. (Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Superior Court (1970) 2
Cal.3d 161, 173.)
The party to whom interrogatories have been propounded
shall respond in writing under oath separately to each interrogatory by any of
the following:
(1) An answer
containing the information sought to be discovered.
(2) An exercise of
the party’s option to produce writings.
(3) An objection to
the particular interrogatory.
 
(CCP § 2030.210(a).)
PROCEDURAL
ANALYSIS
45-Day
Requirement
“Unless notice of this motion is given within
45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding
party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party
waives any right to compel a further response to the interrogatories.” (CCP § 2030.300(c).)
Here, Plaintiffs’ motion is timely.
Meet and Confer
“A
motion under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040.” (CCP §2030.300(b)(1).)
Here, Plaintiffs met and conferred.
TENTATIVE RULING
First, Plaintiffs
should be prepared to address the service issue that this Court pointed out.
 
Plaintiffs
propounded the instant SROGs on November 3, 2023. Before the filing of this
motion, Defendant provided both initial responses and amended responses.
Plaintiffs filed the instant motion on 9/11/2024 because they were not
satisfied with the initial and amended responses. 
 
On November 21,
2024, which was after the 9/11/2024 filing of this motion, Defendant provided further
amended responses. In Defendant’s separate statement, Defendant refers to the
responses provided after the filing of this motion as supplemental responses. 
 
The opposition
argues that this motion is now moot since further responses were provided after
the filing of this motion.
 
Here, the Court
finds that this motion should be denied as moot with respect to compelling
further responses since Defendant provided further responses after the filing
of this motion. 
 
However, the Court
does not find this motion moot with respect to sanctions.
 
Sanctions
“The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP §
2030.300(d).)
 
Plaintiffs argue
that sanctions should be imposed against FCA and its counsel of record (Ongaro
PC) in the amount of $2,610.00.
 
Plaintiffs’
counsel, Zachary Powell, explained the sanctions request as follows:
 
12. As a result of Defendant’s failure to
provide Code-compliant responses and the time and effort it took Plaintiffs to
meet and confer, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court award monetary
sanctions for the costs associated with Plaintiffs’ preparation of this motion.
The total legal fees incurred of preparing the motion and supportive papers
will be as follows:
 
a. I spent a total of two hours (2.0)
drafting the instant motion, separate statement, proposed order, notice of
motion, and declaration, at my normal billing rate of $425.00 per hour, for a
total of $850.00. 
 
b. It is also reasonably anticipated that
I will spend an additional two (2) hours reviewing Defendant’s opposition and
drafting a reply at my normal billing rate of $425.00 per hour, for a total of
$850.00. 
 
c. Finally, it is reasonably anticipated I
will spend an additional two hours preparing for and attending the scheduled
hearing on this matter at my normal billing rate of $425.00 per hour, for a
total of $850.00. 
 
d. In all, legal fees will total $2,550.00
 
13. Our office will be forced to spend
$60.00 in filing the instant motion.
 
(Powell Decl. ¶¶ 12-13.)
 
In Opposition to the discovery sanctions,
Defendant argues that “substantial justification” has been understood to mean
reasonable grounds to believe that the objection was valid when made and that
opposition to the discovery therefore was justified. Defendant cites to Foothill
Properties v. Lyon/Copley Corona Assocs. (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1542,
1557-58 and Doe v. U.S. Swimming, Inc. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1424, 1434
for its interpretation of “substantial justification.”
 
The Court notes that the definition of
“substantial justification” is not entirely clear based on Defendant’s
citations. 
 
The Foothill case does not make any
explicit definition of “substantial justification,” but instead provides
context for when that court found substantial justification. In Foothill,
the Fourth District Court of Appeal noted that it would “uphold the sanction
award unless the court had no rational basis to conclude Lyon’s failure to
produce the documents was unjustified.” (Foothill
Properties v. Lyon/Copley Corona Associates (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1542,
1557.) Further, in Foothill, the Fourth District Court of Appeal found
there was substantial justification when Lyon refused to produce documents
because Lyon was withholding the documents until Lyon was able to litigate its
motion for protective order. (Foothill Properties v. Lyon/Copley Corona
Associates (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1542, 1558.)
 
In Doe, the court explained that
“substantial justification” is understood “to mean that a justification is
clearly reasonable because it is well-grounded in both law and fact.” (Doe
v. United States Swimming, Inc. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1424, 1434.)
 
Opposition argues that sanctions should be
denied because Plaintiffs’ motion should be denied on the merits and because in
an effort to compromise it supplemented its responses.
 
In Reply, Plaintiffs cite to CRC, Rule
3.1348(a) which states, “The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act
in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
 
The Court will hear argument. 
 
The Court is inclined to award at least some
sanctions. The cases Defendant cited does not help the Court in the instant
context where the Court is not compelling further responses based on the fact
that amended responses were provided after the filing of the motion. Further,
for Defendant to simultaneously argue that its objections (in the initial
responses and amended responses) were substantially justified when Defendant
later decided to not object and instead provided further supplemental responses
without objections after the filing of this motion in an effort to compromise
seems to undercut Defendant’s arguments that the objections were substantially
justified in the first place.
