[TENTATIVE RULING
DEMURRER]
RELIEF REQUESTED
“Cross-Defendant STATE COMPENSATION INSURANCE FUND (“STATE FUND”) will and
hereby does demur to the Cross-Complaint filed by Defendant/Cross-Complainant
KARA CONSTRUCTION GROUP INC (“KARA”) on the following grounds:
1.     
STATE FUND demurs to the First Cause of Action for Breach of
Contract on the ground that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction
because KARA has failed to fully exhaust the administrative remedies available
to it before the California Insurance Commissioner. See, Abelleria v.
District Court of Appeal (1941) 17 Cal.2d 280, 292-293; P.W. Stephens,
Inc. v. State Compensation Insurance Fund (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1833,
1840-1841;
 
2.     
STATE FUND demurs to the First Cause of Action for Breach of
Contract on the ground that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision
(e); and
 
3.     
STATE FUND demurs to the First Cause of Action for Breach of
Contract on the ground that it is uncertain pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.10, subdivision (f).
 
STATE
FUND has met and conferred with KARA, who filed the pleading subject to
demurrer, by telephone on or about October 25, 2024. The parties did not reach
an agreement resolving STATE FUND’s objections to the Cross-Complaint.
This
Demurrer is based on this Notice of Demurrer and Demurrer, the accompanying
memorandum of points and authorities, the concurrently filed declaration of
Brandon R. Creel, and any arguments or other evidence as may be presented at or
prior to the hearing on this Demurrer, the record and files in this action, and
such matters upon which the Court may take notice.”

Meet and Confer
A party filing a
demurrer “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who
filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining
whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)  “The
parties shall meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive
pleading is due. If the parties are not able to meet and confer at least five
days prior to the date the responsive pleading is due, the demurring party
shall be granted an automatic 30-day extension of time within which to file a
responsive pleading, by filing and serving, on or before the date on which a
demurrer would be due, a declaration stating under penalty of perjury that a
good faith attempt to meet and confer was made and explaining the reasons why
the parties could not meet and confer.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).) 
Failure
to sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(4).)
Here,
Movant’s counsel alleged that a meet and confer occurred, but an agreement was
not able to be met. (Creel Decl. ¶ 2.)
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff, Creditors
Adjustment Bureau, Inc. filed a complaint on 11/20/2023 against Defendant, Kara
Construction Group Inc. aka Kara Construction Group Inc. alleging four cause of
action for: (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Open Book Account, (3) Account Stated,
and (4) Reasonable Value. 
Plaintiff
alleges that Plaintiff’s Assignor (State Compensation Insurance Fund or SCIF)
and Defendants entered into a written agreement wherein Plaintiff’s Assignor
agreed to provide policies of workers compensation insurance to the Defendants,
bearing Policy Nos. 9268821-21 (covering the period of January 27, 2021 through
January 27, 2022) and 9268821-22 (covering the period of January 27, 2022
through May 1, 2022) and Defendants agreed to pay premiums in accordance with
the terms and conditions of said policies which provided for payment of
premiums. (Compl. ¶ 11.)
Plaintiff
alleges that Defendants breached the part of both policies requiring the
payment of the premium assessed by Plaintiff’s Assignor (State Compensation
Insurance Fund) at the conclusion of the policies. (See Compl. ¶¶ 14-15.)
On
8/12/2024, Defendant/Cross-Complainant, Kara Construction Group Inc. filed a Cross-Complaint
against Cross-Defendant, State Compensation Insurance Fund. [The Court notes
that State Compensation Insurance Fund is indicated to be Plaintiff’s assignor
in the Complaint. (See Compl. ¶ 1.)]
Cross-Complainant/Defendant,
Kara, alleges that Kara procured workers’ compensation insurance policies
(policies) from SCIF. (Cross-Complaint (CC) ¶ 6.) Kara further alleges that it
“paid premiums for the Policies, which are specifically referenced in the
operative complaint filed by SCIF’s assignee, Plaintiff Creditors Adjustment
Bureau.” (Id.)
Kara’s
Cross-Complaint further alleges that “The Policies state that “[t]he final
premium will be determined . . . by using the actual premium basis and the
proper classifications, rates and rating plans that lawfully apply to the
business and work covered by this policy.” The Policies also provide that
“[a]ll premium for this policy will be determined by our manuals of rules,
rates, rating plans and classifications.”” (CC ¶ 7.)
Kara’s
Cross-Complaint further alleges that:
SCIF breached the Policies by overcharging final premium for the
Policies. These are the same policies that form the gravamen of the complaint.
In the complaint, SCIF, through its assignee, has alleged that its final
premium for the Policies is correct and that Kara Construction breached the
Policies. Kara Construction disputes that and contends that SCIF breached the
Polices in determining the final premium SCIF claims is owed.
(CC ¶ 10.)
LEGAL STANDARDS FOR DEMURRERS
Demurrer
– Sufficiency
A demurrer for
sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda, (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747.)  When considering demurrers,
courts read the allegations liberally and in context.  (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of
Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)  The court “treat[s]
the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law ….”  (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 525.)  In a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via
proper judicial notice.  (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and
not the evidence or other extrinsic matters; therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at
747.)  
The
general rule is that the plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts, not
evidentiary facts.  (Doe v. City of
Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) 
“All that is required of a plaintiff, as a matter of pleading … is that
his complaint set forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable
precision and with sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the
nature, source and extent of his cause of action.”  (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp.
(1945) 26 Cal.2d 149, 156-157.)  
On
demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to “determine whether or not
the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any
legal theory.”  (Das v. Bank of
America, N.A. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727, 734.)  Demurrers do not lie as to only parts of
causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose of an
entire cause of action to be sustained.” 
(Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,
119.)  “Generally
it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if
there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.”  (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.)
Demurrer – Uncertainty
A special demurrer for
uncertainty, CCP section 430.10(f), is disfavored and will only be sustained
where the pleading is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e.,
cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or
claims are directed against him/her.  (Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc. (1993)
14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat
vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)
ANALYSIS
Subject
Matter Jurisdiction
Movant/Cross-Defendant/SCIF
argues that Cross-Complainant/Kara was required to exhaust all administrative
remedies before filing this Cross-Complaint. 
SCIF
relies predominantly on Insurance Code sections 11737(f), and 11753.1 and P.W.
Stephens, Inc. v. State Compensation Insurance Fund (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th
1833, 1840-1841 (P.W. Stephens) to argue that Kara was required to
exhaust all administrative remedies before filing this Cross-Complaint. 
The
Court does not find SCIF’s argument availing.
“Administrative
agencies have only such powers as have been conferred on them, expressly or by
implication by Constitution or statute.” (State Compensation Insurance Fund
v. ReadyLink Healthcare, Inc. (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 422, 458 quoting Noble
v. Draper (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1, 12.)
With
respect to SCIF relying on P.W. Stephens as authority for the
proposition that Kara had to exhaust all administrative remedies before filing
its Cross-Complaint alleging breach of the Policies in determining the final
premium owed to SCIF, the Court does not find this argument availing for
several reasons.
First,
P.W. Stephens did not rely on Insurance Code sections 11737(f) and
11753.1 like SCIF does here.
“[W]e
view section 11741 as broad enough to empower the Commissioner to conduct
hearings to assure that premiums are fairly assessed without discrimination.” (P.W.
Stephens, Inc. v. State Compensation Insurance Fund (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th
1833, 1842.)
Unlike
in P.W. Stephens, here, SCIF is not relying on Insurance Code 11741,
SCIF is relying on Insurance Code sections 11737(f) and 11753.1. Further,
Insurance Code 11741 was repealed by Stats.2002, c. 6 (A.B. 749), § 6.5,
operative Jan. 1, 2007. Further, to the extent that P.W. Stephens relied
on Insurance Code § 11737.5(a), not only did Movant here not rely on that
statute, but Insurance Code § 11737.5(a) was repealed by Stats.1993, c. 121
(A.B. 110), § 5.5, eff. July 16, 1993, operative Jan. 1, 1995; Stats. 1993, c.
228 (S.B.30), § 1, operative Jan. 1, 1995.)
Second,
the plain language of Insurance code sections 11737(f) and 11753.1 do not
appear to make it mandatory that Kara must first seek administrative relief
before challenging the final premium owed. 
Under
Ins. Code § 11737(f):
Every insurer or rating organization shall provide within this
state reasonable means whereby any person aggrieved by the application of its
filings may be heard by the insurer or rating organization on written request
to review the manner in which the rating system has been applied in connection
with the insurance afforded or offered. If the insurer or rating organization
fails to grant or reject the request within 30 days, the applicant may proceed
in the same manner as if the application had been rejected. Any party affected
by the action of the insurer or rating organization on the request may appeal,
within 30 days after written notice of the action, to the commissioner who,
after a hearing held within 60 days from the date on which the party requests
the appeal, or longer upon agreement of the parties and not less than 10 days’
written notice to the appellant and to the insurer or rating organization, may
affirm, modify, or reverse that action. If the commissioner has information on
the subject from which the appeal is taken and believes that a reasonable basis
for the appeal does not exist or that the appeal is not made in good faith, the
commissioner may deny the appeal without a hearing. The denial shall be in
writing, set forth the basis for the denial, and be served on all parties.
(Ins. Code § 11737(f).)
Insurance Code § 11737(f) provides that any
person aggrieved may be heard by the insurer or rating organization on
written request. The plain language of this statute does not state that one must
seek administrative review before filing a complaint challenging the price
of a final premium.
Further, Under Ins. Code § 11753.1:
(a) Any person aggrieved by any decision, action, or omission
to act of a rating organization may request that the rating organization
reconsider the decision, action, or omission. If the request for
reconsideration is rejected or is not acted upon within 30 days by the rating
organization, the person requesting reconsideration may, within a reasonable
time, appeal from the decision, action, or omission of the rating organization.
The appeal shall be made to the commissioner by filing a written complaint and
request for a hearing specifying the grounds relied upon. If the commissioner
has information on the subject appealed from and believes that probable cause
for the appeal does not exist or that the appeal is not made in good faith, the
commissioner may deny the appeal without a hearing. The commissioner shall
otherwise hold a hearing to consider and determine the matter presented by the
appeal.
(b) Any insurer adopting a change in the classification
assignment of an employer that results in an increased premium shall notify the
employer in writing, or if the insurance was transacted through an insurance
agent or broker, the insurer shall notify the agent or broker who shall notify
the employer in writing of the change and the reasons for the change. Any
employer receiving this notice shall have the right to request reconsideration
and appeal the reclassification pursuant to this section. The notice required
by this section shall inform the employer of his or her rights pursuant to this
section. No notification shall be required when the change is a result of a
regulation adopted by the Department of Insurance or other action by or under
the authority of the commissioner.
(Ins. Code § 11753.1(a)-(b).)
The plain language of Insurance Code § 11753.1
deals with the handling of an appeal to the commissioner and does not state
that one must seek administrative review before filing a complaint
challenging the price of a final premium.
SCIF also relies on Karlin v. Zalta (1984)
154 Cal.App.3d 953, 983 (Karlin) to support its argument. Reliance on Karlin
is unavailing as it is inapposite because it dealt with medical malpractice
insurance premium rates. Here, we are not dealing with medical malpractice
insurance.
In Opposition, Kara relies on several cases to
argue that it did not have to first exhaust administrative remedies. Some of
the cases that Kara relied on are not entirely on point. However, this Court
does find the Opposition’s citation to State Compensation Insurance Fund v.
ReadyLink Healthcare, Inc. (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 422 (ReadyLink) to be
availing. 
ReadyLink addressed the exact statutes that Movant cites
to support its argument. In relevant part:
The record in this case reveals Insurance Code sections
11753.1 and 11737, subdivision (f) as possible
statutory bases for ReadyLink's appeal to the Insurance Commissioner of
SCIF's audit decision to include the per diem payments as payroll. Both of
these statutory provisions make clear that only the matters identified in those
statutory provisions may be appealed to, and determined by, the Insurance
Commissioner.27 Neither of these provisions indicates that the
Insurance Commissioner has the authority to consider the common law breach of
contract and other collection claims raised by SCIF in this action, or to
consider the equitable and other affirmative defenses to SCIF's claims asserted
by ReadyLink. We have been directed to no authority that would suggest that the
Insurance Commissioner has any authority to consider other aspects of a
premium calculation dispute, beyond the specific matters identified
in sections 11753.1 and 11737, subdivision (f). In fact, case
law and the records in this case suggest otherwise.
(State Compensation Insurance Fund v.
ReadyLink Healthcare, Inc. (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 422, 458-60; the Court
notes that fn. 27 cited the language of 11737(f) and 11753.1.)
“In
contrast, issues of contract interpretation, including whether an insurer accurately calculated
a premium under the contract, and the application of equitable defenses to the
enforcement of a contract, do not involve considerations that fall uniquely
within the Insurance Commissioner's expertise. P. W. Stephens thus
does not support the conclusion that ReadyLink was required to exhaust
administrative remedies before litigating the issues that arise from this
contract dispute.” (State Compensation Insurance Fund v. ReadyLink
Healthcare, Inc. (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 422, 464.)
While
the Reply tries to distinguish ReadyLink to argue that ReadyLink
actually had availed itself to the State Fund’s internal review process as well
as to the DOI’s administrative remedies, the Court does not find this argument
availing as this argument is presented out of context. 
“Further,
the ALJ in this case specifically informed the parties that she was not
determining, and in fact could not determine, whether the
ultimate premium charged by SCIF was correct.” (State Compensation Insurance
Fund v. ReadyLink Healthcare, Inc. (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 422, 462.)
Uncertainty
SCIF also argues that
the breach of contract cause of action is uncertain regarding how SCIF
allegedly breached the policy.
The Court does not find this argument availing. 
A special demurrer for uncertainty, CCP section
430.10(f), is disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so
bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine
what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are
directed against him/her. (Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc. (1993)
14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat
vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)
The Cross-Complaint alleges that “SCIF breached
the Policies in determining the final premium SCIF claims is owed.” (CC ¶ 10.)
TENTATIVE RULING
SCIF’s demurrer to the
first cause of action for breach of contract is OVERRULED.
