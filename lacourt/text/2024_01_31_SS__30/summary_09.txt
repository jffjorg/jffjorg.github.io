Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that Defendant's motions to compel responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, request for production, and motion to deem matters admitted are granted. The judge orders Defendant to provide verified responses to the portion of the discovery responses that contain answers. The judge also orders Plaintiff to provide verified responses to the discovery requests.

The judge finds that Defendant failed to serve verified responses to the discovery requests, despite having been served with the requests. The judge notes that Defendant's counsel has been unable to contact Defendant, but this is not a requirement for serving discovery requests.

The judge also grants Defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $510, to be paid within 20 days of the order. The judge denies Plaintiff's request for sanctions under CCP section 128.5 and CCP section 2023.010.

The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and relevant case law. The judge finds that Defendant is entitled to an order directing Plaintiff to provide verified responses and that Plaintiff is entitled to an order establishing the truth of the matters in the request for admissions served on Defendant.
