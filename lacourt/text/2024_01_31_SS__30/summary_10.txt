And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by Defendant Arquimides Morales. The Defendant's motions to compel Plaintiff Lonnie Marie Ortiz to provide responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents are granted. The Plaintiff is ordered to provide responses without objection to the Defendant's requests within 20 days of the order. The Defendant's request for sanctions is denied. The Court finds that the Defendant is entitled to a court order directing the Plaintiff to provide verified responses to the discovery requests because the Plaintiff failed to serve any responses to the requests. The Defendant's additional request for sanctions under CCP section 2023.010 for misuse of discovery is also denied, citing a prior court decision that monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery are not authorized.
