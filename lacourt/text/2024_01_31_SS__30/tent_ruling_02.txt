 Case Number:  20STCV24453    Hearing Date:   January 31, 2024    Dept:  30 MELTON DAVOOD, et al. vs EDWIN ALDANA, et al.TENTATIVEThe motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff, Karen Shahgeldyan is CONTINUED for 60 days to April 09, 2024 at 1:30 p.m. Plaintiff’s counsel has submitted all of the mandatory judicial council forms (i.e., MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053).However, as this Court has already informed counsel in the last motion to be relieved as counsel, item 8 of the proposed order does not list all the hearings in this matter, e.g., motions for summary judgment scheduled for June 7, 2024 and December 4, 2024. (CRC Rule 3.1362(e).)As such, counsel is ordered to file a corrected proposed order, ensuring that all current hearing dates are listed. At this time, trial is set for March 5, 2024. If trial is continued before the next hearing on this motion, counsel should ensure the continued trial and FSC dates are listed on the proposed order as well. If trial is not continued by the next hearing in this matter, counsel will need to provide an adequate explanation as to how withdrawing so close to trial would not prejudice Plaintiff.Moving party is ordered to give notice.
