Roles:
  - Judge: [Tentative Ruling]
  - Plaintiff: ALEX PEREYA, et al.
  - Defendant: KAISER FOUNDATION HOSPITALS, et al.
Significant Statements:
  - Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged, for purposes of a demurrer or motion for judgment on the pleadings, prior similar incidents of violent crime on Defendant’s premises in order for the special relationship exception to the “no duty to protect” rule to apply.
  - The Court finds that simple means could have been taken by warning of the danger, and that this would have a minimal burden on Defendant.
  - Plaintiff alleges that prior similar incidents had occurred, which satisfies heightened foreseeability.
  - If Defendant had notice of these prior similar criminal acts and failed to take any action, there would be moral blame attached.
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the plaintiff's First Cause of Action fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for negligence against the defendants. The plaintiff has alleged that the defendant had a duty to protect the plaintiff from harm due to prior similar incidents of criminal activity on the defendant's premises. The court finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged prior similar incidents of violent crime on the defendant's premises, which satisfies the special relationship exception to the "no duty to protect" rule. The court also finds that the defendant could have taken simple means to prevent harm, such as warning the plaintiff of the danger, and that this would have had a minimal burden on the defendant.
