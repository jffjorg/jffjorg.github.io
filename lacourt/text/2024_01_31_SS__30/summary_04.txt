```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint. The plaintiff claims that the dismissal was made in error due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, or that there was a clerical error. However, the judge finds that the motion is not timely filed, as it was filed more than six months after the dismissal. The judge also finds that the plaintiff failed to show that there was a clerical error or void judgment. The plaintiff's failure to appear for trial was due to their own negligence, and they failed to move under CCP section 473(b) within six months of the dismissal. Therefore, the judge has no authority to set aside the November 30, 2022 order of dismissal.
