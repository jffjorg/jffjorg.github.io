And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is tentatively ruling that the motion to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Karen Shahgeldyan will be continued for 60 days to April 9, 2024. The plaintiff's counsel has submitted the required judicial council forms, but the proposed order does not list all hearing dates, which is a requirement. The judge is ordering the counsel to file a corrected proposed order that includes all current hearing dates. The trial is currently set for March 5, 2024, and if it is continued, the counsel must ensure that the continued trial and FSC dates are listed on the proposed order. The judge is also requiring the counsel to provide an explanation if the motion to withdraw as counsel close to trial would not prejudice the plaintiff.
