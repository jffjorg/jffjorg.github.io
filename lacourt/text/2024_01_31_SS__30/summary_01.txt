And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge rules that the defendant's motions to compel responses to form interrogatories and special interrogatories are granted, as the plaintiff failed to serve timely responses. The judge orders the plaintiff to provide code-compliant responses within 20 days. The motion to compel responses to the request for production of documents is denied as moot, as the plaintiff has now served amended responses. The request for sanctions is also denied, as the plaintiff's counsel has provided substantial justification for the failure to provide timely responses.
