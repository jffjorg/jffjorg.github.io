The court has granted the defendant's motion to strike the allegations and prayer related to punitive damages in the plaintiff's complaint. The court found that the allegations do not rise to the level of "despicable and willful" conduct required to support a punitive damages claim. The court noted that the plaintiff's allegations of reckless and careless behavior by the defendant are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The court also declined to take judicial notice of certain exhibits submitted by the plaintiff, finding them to be immaterial to the disposition of the motion. The court granted the motion to strike with leave to amend, giving the plaintiff an opportunity to replead the allegations and prayer related to punitive damages.
