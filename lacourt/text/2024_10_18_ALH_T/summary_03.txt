And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The defendant argued that the condition of the sidewalk, which was uneven and raised, was a trivial defect and not a dangerous condition. However, the judge found that the defendant failed to meet its burden of showing that the condition was trivial. The judge also found that the defendant had constructive notice of the condition, which means that it should have been able to discover the condition through a reasonable inspection.

The judge also rejected the defendant's argument that the condition was open and obvious. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had prior knowledge of the condition and that the weather was clear, but the judge found that this was not sufficient to show that the condition was open and obvious.

The judge concluded that there are triable issues of fact on the issues of whether the condition was dangerous or trivial, whether the defendant had notice of the condition, and whether the condition was open and obvious. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment was denied and the case will proceed to trial.
