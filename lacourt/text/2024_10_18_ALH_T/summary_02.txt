And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a personal injury case involving a bicycle accident. The plaintiff, Domingo David Tambriz Cuc, alleges that the defendant, Geocomp Consulting, Inc., was negligent in maintaining the public street where the accident occurred. The defendant argues that the complaint was not served with a certificate of merit as required by CCP § 411.35, and that even if the plaintiff were to file and serve a certificate, it would be untimely.

The judge has overruled the defendant's demurrer, finding that the complaint alleges a cause of action for ordinary negligence against the defendant, rather than professional negligence. The judge has taken judicial notice of various documents and licenses, including the defendant's professional engineering license.

The judge has noted that while the defendant's work may have been performed under the scope of its professional license, it does not necessarily mean that all work performed by the defendant is professional negligence. The judge has also considered the testimony of Mr. Waguespack, who testified that the allegedly dangerous condition was created by the defendant when it monitored a well and filled a resulting hole, which is considered ordinary construction work subject to regular negligence rather than a professional negligence standard.

The ruling is without prejudice to the defendant seeking future relief if a more fulsome factual record establishes that the plaintiff's allegations do indeed fall under the scope of professional negligence.
