And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendant's motion for a new trial. The Defendant argued that the verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence and that juror passion and prejudice led to the excessive damages award. The Defendant also alleged that Plaintiff's attorney engaged in misconduct by waiving economic damages and that the Court abused its discretion by sustaining an objection to admitting into evidence a body camera video. The Judge found that the evidence supported the jury's verdict and that there was no attorney misconduct. The Judge also found that the exclusion of the body camera video was justified because it posed a risk of confusing the jury. The motion for new trial is therefore denied.
