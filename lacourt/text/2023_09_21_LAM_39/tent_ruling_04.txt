Whitley House, LLC v. Gilbert Andrade, Case No. 23STCV17041
 
The
Court advances and continues the final status conference from September 21,
2023, at 8:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. on that same date.  Defendant has
requested a jury trial, so the Court ordered Plaintiff’s counsel to prepare and
file trial documents, i.e., a joint witness list, joint exhibit list, special
verdict form, and proposed jury instructions.  Plaintiff’s counsel failed
to do so.  Therefore, the Court issues an Order to Show Cause why
sanctions should not be imposed against Plaintiff and/or Plaintiff’s counsel,
Ada R. Cordero-Sacks, Esq.  The Court issues this OSC per Code of Civil
Procedure sections 575.2(a) and 177.5, as well as Local Rules 3.10 and
3.25(f)(1).  The Court provides notice that it is considering the
following sanctions: (1) Monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,500 or less
against each party and each counsel-of-record; (2) Evidentiary sanctions, which
may include an order precluding the parties from calling witnesses except
Plaintiff and Defendant’s Person(s) Most Qualified and/or precluding the
parties from introducing any exhibits except those subject to judicial notice;
(3) Issue sanctions; and/or (4) Terminating sanctions.  
 
The
hearing on this OSC re: Sanctions shall be held on September 21, 2023, at 11:00
a.m. at the following location:
 
Stanley
Mosk Courthouse

North Hill Street

The
parties may appear remotely or in-person.  Plaintiff’s counsel may file a
written response on or before September 20, 2023, at 12 Noon, provided they
email a courtesy copy to the Court: SMCDept39@LACourt.org. 
If Plaintiff’s counsel does not wish to file a written response, she may
address the issues orally at the hearing.  
 
If
Plaintiff’s counsel did not file trial documents because the case has settled,
they shall file a notice of settlement forthwith.  If so, the Court’s
clerk is authorized to discharge this OSC without a further hearing or further
authorization from the Court.  
 
The
Court’s clerk shall provide notice by regular mail and by email to each
counsel-of-record.
