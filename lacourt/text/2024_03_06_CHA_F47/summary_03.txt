And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on two motions: a motion for a protective order and a motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories. Ford Motor Company, the defendant, filed a motion for a protective order to protect confidential, proprietary or trade secret information and materials related to the production of documents in response to Plaintiff Omar Maldonado Gonzalez's requests for production. The court granted the motion, but only in part, finding that certain documents contain confidential, proprietary or trade secret information and materials which warrant protection. The court also denied Ford's request to modify the LASC Model Protective Order in certain respects.

The court granted Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories, Set 1, numbers 45-48, finding that the information sought is relevant to Plaintiff's claims and that Ford's responses were evasive or incomplete. The court denied Plaintiff's request for sanctions against Ford and its counsel.

The judge's ruling is based on the facts and procedural history of the case, including the alleged defects and nonconformities in the vehicle, the parties' agreements and disputes, and the relevant laws and regulations. The court's findings and orders are intended to protect the parties' rights and interests while also ensuring the efficient and fair resolution of the case.
