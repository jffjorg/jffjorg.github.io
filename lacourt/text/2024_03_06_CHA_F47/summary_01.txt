And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has denied, without prejudice, a motion filed by attorney Justin Zarcone to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Martin Willerford. The motion was filed on November 17, 2023, along with a declaration in support of the motion. However, the declaration does not include all of the required information, such as confirmation of the client's address and method of service. Additionally, the proof of service for the motion does not indicate that the motion was served on the client. As a result, the Judge has denied the motion without prejudice, meaning that attorney Zarcone may refile the motion and address the deficiencies identified by the Court. The next hearing date is set for August 5, 2024.
