And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion to enforce the settlement agreement between the plaintiffs and defendant. The settlement agreement was signed on September 7, 2023, and provides that the parties would list the property for sale, share the costs of the sale and escrow as sellers, and share the proceeds of the sale 50-50. The court finds that the defendant has breached the settlement agreement by refusing to show the property to prospective buyers and failing to prepare mutual releases. The court orders the defendant to make the property available for showings seven days a week at any time between 9:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. whenever he is given at least 24 hours advance notice, until escrow closes on the sale of the property, and to draft and circulate to the plaintiffs a proposed mutual release document(s) as required by the settlement agreement. The court also notes that the defendant cannot re-negotiate the settlement terms to which he agreed on September 7, 2023.
