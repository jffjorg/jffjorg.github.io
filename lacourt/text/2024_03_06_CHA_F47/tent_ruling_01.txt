Case #22CHCV00016
 
MOTION TO BE
RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Motion filed on 11/17/23.
 
MOVING ATTORNEY: Justin Zarcone
CLIENT: Plaintiff Martin Willerford
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order relieving attorney
Justin Zarcone as counsel for Plaintiff Martin Willerford in this action.  
 
RULING: The motion is denied without
prejudice.  
 
On 11/17/23, attorney Justin Zarcone filed a “Notice of
Motion To Be Relieved As Counsel – Civil” as to Plaintiff Martin Willerford on
Judicial Council form MC-051 which has been adopted for mandatory use.

Judicial Council form MC-052 must be used for a declaration in support

The declaration submitted by attorney Zarcone does not include all of
the information required in the mandatory Judicial Council form
declaration.  For instance, attorney Zarcone
does not set forth that he confirmed the client’s address within the 30 days
before filing the motion.  Additionally,
the declaration does not indicate how the motion was sent to the client’s last
known address which was not confirmed (i.e., by regular USPS mail, personal
service).  Nor does the declaration set
forth the next hearing dates, etc.  (See
Zarcone Decl. filed 11/17/23; Judicial Council for MC-052).
 
Attorney Zarcone has also failed to lodge a proposed
order on Judicial Council form MC-053.
 
Further, the proof of service for the motion filed on 11/20/24 does not
indicate that the motion was served on the client.  The declaration of attorney Zarcone stating
that a copy of the motion was delivered to the client’s last known address does
not meet the requirements for a valid proof of service (i.e., no information as
to how the motion w
