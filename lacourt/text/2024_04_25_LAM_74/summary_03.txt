And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge grants Defendant's motion to compel Plaintiff's responses to form interrogatories (general) and special interrogatories (set one) due to Plaintiff's failure to provide timely responses. The court also grants Defendant's request for sanctions, ordering Plaintiff to pay Defendant's counsel $240 in attorney fees within 30 days. The court will adjust the award accordingly. The judge notes that Defendant's counsel's proposed hourly rate is reasonable and that the court will adjust the award based on the amount of work performed. The court also notes that this motion largely duplicates Defendant's other motions to compel.
