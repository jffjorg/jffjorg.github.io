And here is the summary in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The defendants filed the motion on February 23, 2023, but the court determined that the motion was untimely because it was not served 75 days before the initial hearing date of May 12, 2023. The court based its decision on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 437c and 1010.6, which require that notice of a motion for summary judgment be served at least 75 days before the hearing date. The defendants' failure to serve their notice and motion on time means that their motion is untimely and will be denied.
