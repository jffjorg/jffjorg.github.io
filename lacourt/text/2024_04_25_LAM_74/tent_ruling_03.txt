 Case Number:  23STCV05044    Hearing Date:   April 25, 2024    Dept:  74 April Netus
v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, et al.
Defendant Noor Staffing Group LLC’s
Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Form Interrogatories (General) and
Request for Sanctions.
 
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from an employment dispute.
            On
March 7, 2023, Plaintiff April Netus (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against
Defendant Noor Staffing Group (Defendant) and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
            On
September 24, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with form interrogatories
(general). 
            After
multiple extensions, Plaintiff’s counsel failed to provide timely responses.
            On
March 15, 2024, Defendant filed this motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to
the form interrogatories and request for sanctions.
LEGAL STANDARD
¿¿            If
a party to whom interrogatories or an inspection demand were directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses without objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b),
2031.300, subd. (b).) Moreover, failure to timely serve responses waives
objections to the requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300,
subd. (a).) Failure to verify a response is equivalent to no response at all. (Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)  
DISCUSSION  
            The
court grants this motion because Plaintiff has failed to provide timely
responses to the form interrogatories. Because Plaintiff lacked substantial
justification for her failure to respond, sanctions are necessary. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).) Defendant’s counsel’s proposed hourly rate is
reasonable, and she has provided a breakdown of work performed. (Marko Decl., ¶
7.) However, this motion largely duplicates Defendant’s other discovery motions.
The court will adjust the award accordingly.
CONCLUSION 
The
court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff responses to form
interrogatories (general). Plaintiff shall provide Code-Compliant responses
without objections within 30 days of this order. The court grants Defendant’s
counsel’s request for sanctions. Plaintiff shall pay Defendant’s counsel $240
in attorney fees within 30 days of this order.
Defendant
shall give notice.///////////////////////April Netus
