  Case Number:  21STCV28191    Hearing Date:   April 25, 2024    Dept:  74 Kevin Blackman v. Transdev Services,
Inc., et al.
 
Motion for Summary Judgment or, in
the alternative, Summary Adjudication
 
The
court considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from an employment dispute. 
            On
July 30, 2021, Plaintiff Kevin Blackman (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against
Defendants Transdev Services, Inc., Transdev North America, Inc., and Timothy
Grensavitch (Defendants). 
            The
complaint alleges race discrimination, disability discrimination, racial
harassment, disability harassment, retaliation under Fair Employment and
Housing Act (FEHA), failure to prevent harassment, discrimination, harassment,
or retaliation, retaliation under Labor Code section 1102.5, constructive
discharge in violation of public policy, violation of Civil Code section 43,
intentional infliction of emotional distress, failure to provide reasonable
accommodation, and failure to engage in the interactive process.
            On
February 23, 2023, Defendants filed this motion for summary judgment or, in the
alternative, summary adjudication.
DISCUSSION 
            The
court denies Defendants’ motion for summary judgment because it is untimely.
             Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (a)(2) requires that notice of this motion and supporting papers be
served at least 75 days before the hearing. Code of Civil Procedure section
1010.6, extends the period of notice by two court days for electronic service.
(See Cole v. Superior Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 87-88.) To
determine the deadline for the last day to serve, the moving party counts
backward, starting with the day before the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 12,
12c, subd. (a).) The moving party counts the last day unless it is a Saturday,
Sunday, or other judicial holiday. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 12, 12a; California
Rules of Court, rule 1.10, subd. (a).) If the last day falls on a Saturday,
Sunday, or other judicial holiday, the moving party continues moving backward
until the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or judicial holiday. (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 12, 12a, 12c.) After determining the last day for service, the
moving party then counts backward from that day for any extra days that are
added based on method of service. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 12c, subd. (b).) 
            The
hearing for this motion was set for May 12, 2023.[1] 75
days before this date fell on Sunday, February 26, 2023, meaning the 75-day
cut-off fell on Friday, February 24, 2023. But the proof of service indicates
that Defendants served the notice and motion by email. Thus, Defendants needed
to serve their notice and motion by Wednesday, February 22, 2023. Defendants
did not, however, serve their papers until February 23, 2023. Accordingly, Defendants’
motion is untimely. 
CONCLUSION
                The court denies Defendants’ motion
for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication.
            Defendants
shall give notice.
