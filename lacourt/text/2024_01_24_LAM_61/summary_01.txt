  - "Sanctions should be tailored to serve the remedial purpose, should not put the moving party in a better position than he would otherwise have been had he obtained the requested discovery, and should be proportionate to the offending party's misconduct."
  - "Rather than decide the facts with respect to the intentional destruction of evidence and impose a nonmonetary sanction on a pretrial motion in circumstances not contemplated by the discovery statutes, we believe that in most cases of purported spoliation the facts should be decided and any appropriate inference should be made by the trier of fact after a full hearing at trial."

Summary:

The judge has denied Defendant Citimortgage, Inc.'s motion for terminating, issue, or evidentiary sanctions against Plaintiffs Claudette Marie Leslie, Rodwell N. Leslie, and Lillette E. Leslie based on alleged spoliation of evidence. The dispute arose from the loss of digital copies of two alleged November 2018 letters, which were stored on a computer that was auctioned off on May 16, 2023. Defendant claimed that the loss of the computer was intentional and sought to hold Plaintiffs accountable for the destruction of evidence. However, the judge found that the evidence of intentional spoliation was not strong enough to warrant dispositive sanctions and that the facts should be decided by the trier of fact at trial.
