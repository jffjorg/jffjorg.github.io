And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer and motion to strike portions of the First Amended Complaint with leave to amend as to the fifth cause of action for falsification of medical records, the fourth cause of action alleged against Defendants Tsuyoshi Todo, M.D., and Mohammad Alzhari, M.D., and the prayer for attorney fees and prejudgment interest.

The judge finds that the Plaintiff's claims are insufficient as a matter of law in certain respects, including the failure to plead the elements of fraud in the fifth cause of action and the lack of specificity in the allegations of informed consent violations. The judge also finds that the Plaintiff's claims are duplicative of each other and that the Plaintiff is not entitled to attorney fees and prejudgment interest.

The judge grants the motion to strike with leave to amend as to the prayer for attorney fees and prejudgment interest, and sustains the demurrer with leave to amend as to the fourth cause of action alleged against Defendants Tsuyoshi Todo, M.D., and Mohammad Alzhari, M.D.

The judge's ruling does not affect the remaining causes of action, which are still pending.
