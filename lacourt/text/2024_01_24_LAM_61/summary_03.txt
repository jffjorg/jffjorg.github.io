And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Vladimir Rozumny, has moved to quash the service of summons, claiming that the proof of substitute service is defective. However, the judge has denied the motion. The judge has found that the proof of service is supported by the sworn statement of the registered process server, which creates a presumption in favor of the facts stated therein. The defendant's declaration, on the other hand, is framed in an evasive manner and does not rebut the testimony of the process server. The judge has also pointed out that the defendant's characterization of the surveillance footage, which he does not submit with the motion, raises the natural inference that the process server could have entered the premises at any time before 12:51 p.m. on the day in question. Therefore, the judge has denied the motion to quash the service of summons.
