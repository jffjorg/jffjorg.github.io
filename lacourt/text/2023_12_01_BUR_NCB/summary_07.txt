Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Defendant Douglas Peter Richter's motion to seal the court records in this unlawful detainer action. The Defendant argues that the records should be sealed because they arise from a matter that was previously sealed by the courts, and that there is an overriding interest in protecting his rental records and ability to find affordable housing. However, the Judge finds that the Defendant has not demonstrated a legitimate basis for sealing the records, and that the presumption of openness of court records should prevail. The Judge also notes that the proposed sealing would be too broad and would not be narrowly tailored to specific documents or redactions. Therefore, the motion to seal is denied.
