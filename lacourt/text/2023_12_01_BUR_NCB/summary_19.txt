Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering the case brought by Diana Gomez and William Antonio Barrera, Jr. against the trustees of the original trust. The petitioners allege that the amendment and restatement of the trust agreement in 2022 is invalid, and that the trustees have breached their duties. The petitioners also seek to invalidate the lis pendens filed by the defendants and to return the trust property to the trust. The judge notes that the petitioners' opposition papers argue that a previous case (Case No. 22BBCV00328) found that the lis pendens did not affect the title or right of possession of real property, but the judge finds that this is not accurate. The judge also notes that the defendants did not refile the lis pendens in the first action, but instead filed a new one in the probate action. The judge is considering the petitioners' claims under Probate Code, Civil Code, and California Code of Civil Procedure, and will likely issue a ruling on the petitioners' intentions.
