[TENTATIVE] order RE:
APPLICATION for writ of attachment
 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations

Plaintiff ARF Financial LLC f/k/a Advance
Restaurant Finance, LLC, a California limited liability company, assignee of
Mission Valley Bank. (“Plaintiff”) alleges that on March 30, 2023, Defendants We
Waffle, LLC dba The Waffle Experience (“Waffle”) and Michael Don Donoho
(“Donoho”) entered into a written Merchant Credit Application requesting a loan
for $250,000.  Plaintiff alleges it
obtained financing for defendants on March 31, 2022 from Mission Valley Bank
and executed and Defendants executed and delivered to Mission Valley Bank a
Merchant Agreement obtaining a loan for $280,000.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendants were to pay
the loan in 78 weeks starting from April 6, 2022.  Plaintiff alleges that on March 7, 2023,
Waffle executed and delivered to assignor an Amendment D to the agreement, refinancing
the terms of the original agreement with the new loan amount of $240,960.32 and
payment of the loan over 156 weekly payments. 
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants have breached their obligations under
the Agreement and Amendment by failing to pay all the sums due.  The total amount due is $396,426.10.  
Plaintiff also alleges that Donoho
executed a written Guarantee of the Agreement and Amendment, to guaranty
Defendants’ obligation under the agreement. 

Plaintiff alleges that Mission Valley Bank
assigned its rights, title, and interest in the loan back to Advance Restaurant
Finance, LLC pursuant to the Transfer Agreement.  
             The complaint, filed August 3, 2023, alleges causes
of action for: (1) breach of written agreement; (2) breach of guarantee; (3) money
lent; (4) indebtedness; (5) unjust enrichment; and (6) account stated. 
B.    
Application
for Writ of Attachment 
On October 19, 2023, Plaintiff filed an
application for writ of attachment against Defendant Michael Don Donoho. 
The Court is not in receipt of an
opposition brief. 
LEGAL
STANDARD
“Upon the filing of the complaint or at
any time thereafter, the plaintiff may apply pursuant to this article for a
right to attach order and a writ of attachment by filing an application for the
order and writ with the court in which the action is brought.”  (CCP § 484.010.)
The application shall be executed under
oath and must include:
(1)              
a statement showing that the attachment is sought to secure
the recovery on a claim upon which an attachment may be issued;
(2)              
a statement of the amount to be secured by the attachment;
(3)              
a statement that the attachment is not sought for a purpose
other than the recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is based;
(4)              
a statement that the applicant has no information or belief
that the claim is discharged or that the prosecution of the action is stayed in
a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. section 101 et seq.); and 
(5)              
a description of the property to be attached under the writ
of attachment and a statement that the plaintiff is informed and believes that
such property is subject to attachment.
(CCP
§ 484.020.) 
“The application [for a writ of
attachment] shall be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on
the facts presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the
attachment is based.”  (CCP §
484.030.)  Statutory attachment procedures are purely
creations of the legislature and as such “are subject to ‘strict
construction.’”  (Hobbs v. Weiss
(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 76, 79 [citing Vershbow v. Reiner (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 879, 882]; see also Nakasone v. Randall (1982) 129 Cal.App.3d
757, 761.)  A judge does not have
authority to order any attachment that is not provided for by the attachment
statutes.  (Jordan-Lyon Productions, Ltd. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29
Cal.App.4th 1459, 1466.)  “The
declarations in the moving papers must contain evidentiary facts, stated ‘with particularity,’ and based on actual
personal knowledge with all documentary evidence properly identified and
authenticated.”  (Hobbs, supra, 73
Cal.App.4th at 79–80 [citing CCP § 482.040].)  “In contested applications, the court
must consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective parties
and make a determination of the probable outcome of the litigation.”  (Id. at 80 [ellipses and quotation marks omitted].)  “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is
more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the
defendant on that claim.”  (CCP §
481.190.)  
The Court shall issue a right to attach
order if the Court finds all of the following:
(1)              
The claim upon which the attachment is based is one upon
which an attachment may be issued.
(2)              
The plaintiff has established the probable validity of the
claim upon which the attachment is based.
(3)              
The attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the
recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is based.
(4)              
The amount to be secured by the attachment is greater than
zero.
(CCP § 484.090(a).)  
A claim of exemption must describe the
property to be exempted and specify the statute section supporting the
claim.  (CCP § 484.070(c).)  The plaintiff has the burden of opposing the
defendant’s claim of exemption, and if the plaintiff fails to oppose a claim of
exemption, “no right to attach order or writ of attachment shall be issued as
to the property claimed to be exempted.” 
(CCP § 484.070(f).)
DISCUSSION

A.    Probable
Validity of Plaintiff’s Claims
Plaintiff applies
for writ of attachment against Defendant Donoho.  
“The standard elements of a claim for
breach of contract are: “(1) the contract, (2) plaintiff's performance or
excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) damage to plaintiff
therefrom. [Citation.]”  (Wall
Street Network, Ltd. v. New York Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171,
1178.)  
In support of the application, Plaintiff
provides the declaration of Vince Monard, who is employed by Plaintiff as the
Chief Financial Officer.  (Monard Decl.,
¶1.)  Mr. Monard states that he is the
custodian of records.  (Id., ¶¶2-4.)    
Mr. Monard states that on March 30, 2020, Defendants
executed the written Merchant Credit Application and Loan Agreement
(“Agreement”) to Plaintiff in the principal sum of $280,000.  (Id., ¶5, Exs. 1-2.)  He states that Donoho executed a written
Guarantee of the Agreement and Amendment to induce Plaintiff to enter into the Agreement
with Waffle.  (Id., ¶5, Ex.
2.)  By the terms of the Agreement, Defendants
were to pay the principal sum of $280,000 to Plaintiff over 78 weekly payments
starting on April 6, 2022.  (Id.,
¶7.)  On March 7, 2023, Defendants
executed an Amendment D in the principal sum of $240,960.32.  (Id., ¶8, Ex. 3.)  Mr. Monard states that Plaintiff performed
its obligations under the Agreements.  (Id.,
¶9.)  He states that Defendants have
breached their obligations under the Agreement and Amendment by failing to pay
all sums due.  (Id., ¶10.)  He states that pursuant to the Agreement and
Amendment’s terms, Plaintiff is declaring the whole sum of the principal and
interest due and payable, which totals $396,426.10.  (Id., ¶¶11, 13, Ex. 4 [Statement of
Account].)  Mr. Monard states that the
total amount sought in the writ of attachment is $414,470.47, which includes
$396,426.10 in unsecured principal, $17,609.37 in attorney’s fees, and $435 in
costs.  (Id., ¶17.)  
Based on the declaration of Mr. Monard,
the Court finds that Plaintiff has established the probable validity of its
breach of Agreement/Amendment and Guarantee claims.  Plaintiff has shown each of the elements of a
breach of contract claims by way of the declaration of Mr. Monard and the
attached exhibits.  The motion is not
opposed and no contradictory evidence has been presented.
Accordingly, Plaintiff has established the
probable validity of its claims upon which the attachment is based.
B.     Basis
of Attachment
The Court shall issue a right to attach order
if the claim upon which the attachment is based is one upon which an attachment
may be issued.  (CCP § 484.090.)  “[A]n attachment may be issued only in an
action on a claim or claims for money, each of which is based upon a contract,
express or implied, where the total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or
readily ascertainable amount not less than five hundred dollars ($500) exclusive
of costs, interest, and attorney’s fees.” 
(CCP § 483.010(a).)  “If the action
is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be issued
only on a claim which arises out of the conduct by the defendant of a trade,
business, or profession.”  (CCP §
483.010(c).)
This first requirement has been met. 
Plaintiff’s claim is based on Defendant’s outstanding debt owed to
Plaintiff as a result of breaches of the Agreement/Amendment and the
Guarantee.  The amount Plaintiff seeks to
be secured by the attachment is $414,470.47 (which includes $435 in costs and
$17,609.37 in attorney’s fees), which is greater than $500.00.  (See AT-105, §8.)  
C.     Purpose and Amount of Attachment
CCP §
484.090(a)(3)-(4) states that the Court shall issue a right to attach order if
“the attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the
claim upon which the attachment is based . . . [and] the amount to be secured
by the attachment is greater than zero.”
In this case, Plaintiff attests on Form
AT-105 that the attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery
on a claim upon which the attachment is based. 
(AT-105, §4.)  Also, it is clear
from the evidence presented that the amount to be secured is greater than
zero.  There is no indication that the
application is sought for any other purpose, and Defendants do not argue that
the action is brought for any other purpose. 

Accordingly, the Court determines that Plaintiff has complied with CCP
§§ 484.020 and 484.090.
D.    Subject
Property
CCP § 484.020(e) provides, as follows:
Where the defendant is a corporation,
a reference to “all corporate property which is subject to attachment pursuant
to subdivision (a) of Code of Civil Procedure Section 487.010” satisfies the
requirements of this subdivision. Where the defendant is a partnership or other unincorporated association, a reference to “all
property of the partnership or other unincorporated association which
is subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (b) of Code of
Civil Procedure Section 487.010” satisfies the requirements of this
subdivision. Where the defendant is a natural person, the
description of the property shall be reasonably adequate to permit the
defendant to identify the specific property sought to be attached.
(CCP
§ 484.020(e).)  
Plaintiff seeks
the following property from Defendant Donoho, who is a natural person:
1)
Property including, but not limited to: equipment and inventory of a going
business, specifically the Sacramento location at 4391 Gateway Park Blvd, Ste
650, Sacramento, CA 95834, subject to CCP sections 488.375 and 448.395; 2) All
vehicles of a going business, pacifically the Sacramento location at 4391
Gateway Park Blvd, Ste 650, Sacramento, CA 95834, pursuant to CCP Section
488.385; 3) Deposit Accounts thereof pursuant to CCP Section 488.455; 4) Any
accounts receivables or general intangibles pursuant to CCP Section 488.470; 5)
Any interest in real property except: leasehold estates with unexpired terms of
less than 1 year (CCP 487.010); If defendant’s real property is subject to a
homestead declaration, the amount of any surplus over the total of (CCP
487.025): a) All liens and encumbrances on the homestead at the time attachment
lien created; plus b) The homestead exemption; 6) Liquor license, specifically
the Sacramento location at 4391 Gateway Park Blvd, Ste 650, Sacramento, CA
95834.  
(AT-105,
¶9(c); Attachment AT-105.)  
Plaintiff has properly described the
property sought to be attached. (See CCP § 487.010.)
E.     Exemptions
As the motion is
not opposed, Defendant has not stated whether they are claiming an entitlement
to any exemptions.  Accordingly, the
Court finds that Defendant is not entitled to any exemptions.  
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
Plaintiff’s application for writ of
attachment against Defendant Michael Don Donoho is granted in the total amount
of $396,426.10.  At this time, the Court
declines to grant a writ of attachment for attorney’s fees and costs incurred
to bring the application.  
CCP § 489.210 requires the plaintiff to
file an undertaking before issuance of a writ of attachment.  CCP § 489.220 provides that “the amount of an
undertaking filed pursuant to this article shall be ten thousand dollars
($10,000).”  The Court may increase this
amount “to the amount it determines to be the probable recovery for wrongful
attachment if it is ultimately determined that the attachment was wrongful.”  (CCP § 489.220(b).)  Accordingly, upon granting the application, Plaintiff
is ordered to post an undertaking in the amount of $10,000.00 prior to the
issuance of the writ of attachment against Defendant Michael Don Donoho. 
Plaintiff shall
provide notice of this order.
