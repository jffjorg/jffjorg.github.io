And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Umar Calderon. Counsel seeks to withdraw due to a complete breakdown of the attorney-client relationship, which occurred after Defendant's insurer tendered its policy limits but Plaintiff refused to accept settlement of his claims. The judge finds that there is sufficient time for Plaintiff to obtain substitute counsel before the next scheduled hearing, and accordingly grants the motion. The order will become effective upon the filing of a proof of service of a signed copy of the order on Plaintiff Umar Calderon.
