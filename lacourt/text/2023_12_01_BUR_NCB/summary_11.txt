Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from Defendant Shay Production, Inc. regarding special interrogatories. The plaintiff seeks to identify each person who worked at the same hours and dates as he did during his employment with Shay. Defendant Shay Production, Inc. objected to the request, claiming it was overbroad and sought information protected by attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine. The judge finds that the request is not overbroad and is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The judge also awards $610 in sanctions to the plaintiff.
