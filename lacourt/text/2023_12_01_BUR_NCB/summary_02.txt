And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendants' motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiff. The defendants claim that they were aware of their breach of contract claim since the time they filed their answer, but the court finds that they have not acted in good faith in filing the cross-complaint. The court also finds that the cross-complaint is without merit and seems calculated to cause delay. The court orders that the defendants provide notice of this order.
