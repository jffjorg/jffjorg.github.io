```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the third affirmative defense, which alleges Anticipatory Repudiation. Defendants claim that the plaintiff breached their contract, which excuses their duties to perform their obligations. The judge notes that the answer was filed by self-represented litigants and that the retainer agreement is not produced. The judge also finds that the attorney-client privilege has been waived as to any communications or work-product that mention the cross-complaint, but not as broadly as the plaintiff's counsel suggests. The judge concludes that if the direction to file a cross-complaint was made at the outset of representation, it would have been mentioned in the retainer agreement. The judge's tentative ruling is based on the facts and law presented before the court, including Evidence Code ยง 412, and will be finalized after further consideration.
