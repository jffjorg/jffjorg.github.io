  order RE:
Application for an order permitting daniel r. strecker, esq. to
  appear as counsel pro hac vice 
 



 
            Counsel
Daniel R. Strecker, Esq. (“Counsel”) applies to appear as counsel pro hac vice for Defendant Safety-Kleen
Systems, Inc.  
Under CRC Rule 9.40, attorneys licensed and in good standing in other
states may, upon the California court’s approval, appear as counsel pro hac vice in a pending case if an
active member of the state bar is associated as attorney of record.  (CRC Rule 9.40(a).)  Counsel is a member, in good standing, of the State Bar
of New York.  (Counsel
Decl., ¶¶1, 3.)  In addition, Counsel is not a resident of the State of California, is
not regularly employed in the State of California, and is not engaged in
substantial business, professional or other activities in the State of
California.  (Id., ¶2.)  Thus, Counsel
satisfies the eligibility
requirements of CRC Rule 9.40(a). 
Counsel’s declaration addresses the six content
requirements outlined in CRC Rule 9.40(d). 
Counsel provides: (1) his residence and office address (Counsel
Decl., ¶2); (2) the
courts to which he has been admitted to practice and the dates of admission (id., ¶3); (3) that he is a member in
good standing in those courts (id., ¶3);
(4) that he is not currently suspended or disbarred in any court (id., ¶3); (5) that he has filed 4 applications
to appear as counsel pro hac vice in
the state of California, which were granted on December 15, 2022 in Farro v.
Safety-Kleen Systems, Inc. (Orange County Case No.
30-2020-01130033-CU-TT-CXC), on March 29, 2022 in Razi v. Ashland LLC
(Alameda County Case No. RG21094270), on January 4, 2022 in Torres v. Barnes
Group Inc. (San Bernardino Case No. CIVDS1906092), and February 1, 2022 in Mansour
v. 3M Company (Los Angeles County Case No. 19STCV10959) (id., ¶6); and (6) the name, address, and
telephone number of the active member of the State Bar of California who is
attorney of record (id., ¶4).  
Furthermore, Counsel has met the requirement of CRC 9.40(c)(1) which
states that “a person desiring to appear as counsel pro hac vice in a superior court must file with the court a
verified application together with proof of service . . . of a copy of the
application and of the notice on all parties who have appeared in the cause and
on the State Bar of California at its San Francisco office.”  (David M. Uchida Decl., ¶4, Ex. A; Proof of Service.)

R. Strecker, Esq. is
