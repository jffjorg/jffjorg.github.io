  [TENTATIVE] order RE:
petition to confirm contractual arbitration award
 



            
BACKGROUND 
A.   
Petition Allegations 
Petitioner Forward Financing, LLC filed a Petition to Confirm
Contractual Arbitration Award against Respondents Special Effects Unlimited,
Inc. dba Special Effects Unlimited (“Special Effects”) and Pamela Elliot
(“Elliot”).  According to the petition,
the parties entered into a written Future Receipts Sales Agreement on August 8,
2022, which included an arbitration provision at section 10.  (Pet., Attachment 4(b).)  The underlying dispute was based on
Respondents’ alleged breach of the agreement whereby the parties agreed
Petitioner would purchase $106,400 worth of future receivables for $69,005 from
Respondents.  Respondents had allegedly failed
to pay Petitioner the weekly rate of $3,325 until the $106,400 was paid.  (Pet., ¶5.) 

The matter went to arbitration on July 21, 2023 in Boston,
Massachusetts before Arbitrator Anne W. Larkin. 
(Pet., ¶¶6-7.)  The Award of
Arbitrator was made that same day, which required Respondents to pay to
Petitioner the amount of $60,160.  (Pet.,
¶8; Attachment 8(c).)  Petitioner alleges
that a signed copy of the award was served on July 21, 2023.  (Pet., ¶9(b).)  
Petitioner filed this petition on August 14, 2023.  It now requests that the Court confirm the
award and enter judgment according to the Award of Arbitrator.
The matter initially came for hearing on October 6, 2023.  The Court continued the hearing to December
1, 2023 in order to provide time for Petitioner to serve Respondent Pamela
Elliot with the petition papers or file proof of service of the petition.  The Court ordered any opposition and reply
brief to be filed pursuant to code. 
On August 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing that
Special Effects was served by personal service on August 25, 2023.  On October 6, 2023, Plaintiff filed a proof
of service showing that the petition documents were personally served on Elliot
on August 26, 2023.  
The Court is not in receipt of an opposition brief.  
DISCUSSION
A.   
Service of the Arbitration Award and Timeliness of the
Petition 
            CCP § 1288 states: “A petition to confirm an award shall be served and filed not later than four
years after the date of service of a signed copy of the award on the
petitioner. A petition to vacate an award or to
correct an award shall be served and filed not later than 100 days after the
date of the service of a signed copy of the award on the petitioner.”  “No petition may be served and filed under
this chapter until at least 10 days after service of the signed copy of the
award upon the petitioner.”  (CCP
§ 1288.4.) Under CCP § 1290.2, no less than 10 days’ notice must be provided to
the responding party before any hearing on the confirmation petition.  
The arbitration took place on July 21, 2023.  (Pet., ¶7.) 
The Award of Arbitrator was entered on July 21, 2023, which required
Respondents to pay Petitioner the amount of $60,160.  (Pet., ¶8; Attachment 8(c).)  In the letter attached to the Award of
Arbitrator, a signed copy of the award was actually served on July 21, 2023.  (Pet., ¶9; see Attachment 8(c).)  
On August 28, 2023, Petitioner filed a proof of service of the petition
papers on Defendant Special Effects by personally serving Elliot on August 25,
2023 at 12:38 p.m. at 8942 Lankershim Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 91352.  On October 6, 2023, Plaintiff filed a proof
of service showing that the petition documents were personally served on Elliot
on August 26, 2023 at 10326 Johanna Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 91040.  
Based on this timeline of events, the petition was timely filed and
served.  The service of the Final Award
took place on July 21, 2023.  The
petition was filed within 4 years of that date. 
Service of the petition occurred at least 10 days after the Final Award
was served, and at least 10 days prior to this petition hearing date.  
B.    
Merits of Petition 
            The petition includes
a copy of the Future Receipts Sale Agreement (i.e., the underlying written
agreement between the parties), which is attached as Attachment 4(b) to the
petition.  Section 10 includes the “Mandatory
Arbitration of Disputes / Waivers” term. 
Section 10(a) states that the parties agree that any court with
jurisdiction may enter judgment upon the arbitrator’s award, which will be
final and binding.    
The arbitration was conducted by Anne W. Larkin on July 21, 2023 with
the AAA in Boston, Massachusetts.  (Pet.,
¶¶6-7.)  According to the Award of
Arbitrator, Petitioner appeared through its in-house counsel and Respondents
failed to appear through their attorney to the arbitration hearing.  The arbitrator reviewed the evidence and
determined that Respondents owed to Petitioner $60,160, which included $58,975 in
damages, $47.50 in a financing charge, and $1,137.50 for administrative fees
and arbitration costs.  Pursuant to the
agreement, Respondents were jointly and severally liable for the amount
awarded.  
             According to the petition, Petitioner seeks
confirmation of the Award and entry of judgment according to its terms.  (Pet., ¶10.) 

Therefore, there is substantive merit to granting this petition
according to the terms of the arbitrator’s Final Award.  In addition, the petition is not opposed and
Respondents have not filed a petition to vacate the award within 100 days of
service of the signed award (i.e., 100 days from February 22, 2019 is June 2,
2019).  (See CCP §1288.)  Thus, the Court grants this petition.  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Petitioner Forward
Financing, LLC’s petition to confirm the arbitrator’s Award of Arbitrator is granted.

Warning regarding electronic appearances:  All
software for remote or electronic appearances is subject to malfunction based
on system weakness and human error, which can originate from any of the
multiple parties participating each morning. The seamless operation of the
Court’s electronic appearance software is dependent on numerous inconstant and
fluctuating factors that may impact whether you, or other counsel or the Court
itself can be heard in a particular case. Not all these factors are within the
control of the courtroom staff. For example, at times, the system traps
participants in electronic purgatories where they cannot be heard and where the
courtroom staff is not aware of their presence. If you call the courtroom,
please be respectful of the fact that a court hearing is going on, and that the
courtroom staff is doing their best to use an imperfect system. If it is
truly important to you to be heard, please show up to the courtroom in the
normal way. Parking is free or reasonable in Burbank.
Petitioner shall provide notice of this order.
