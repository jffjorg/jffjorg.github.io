And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by General Motors LLC in a case involving a vehicle purchase. The plaintiffs, Manuel Sibrian and Julia Michelle Sibrian, alleged that the vehicle was delivered with a defective transmission and other defects. General Motors LLC demurred to the fourth cause of action, which alleged fraud, and moved to strike the allegations for punitive damages.

The judge found that the demurrer to the fourth cause of action was sustained, but with 20 days' leave to amend. The judge also granted the motion to strike the allegations for punitive damages, as they were not adequately pled. The judge noted that the plaintiff's warranty and fraud claims were inextricably interrelated and that a fraud involves a concealment or misrepresentation of a cold, hard fact.

The judge also cited various legal authority, including California Civil Code Section 1794 and California Civil Code Section 3294, to support their ruling. The judge cautioned that the electronic appearance software used for remote appearances may malfunction and advised counsel to be respectful of the courtroom staff and to show up in person if necessary.
