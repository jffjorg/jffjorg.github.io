[TENTATIVE] order RE:
APPLICATIONs for writ of attachment
 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations

Plaintiff Pawnee Leasing Corporation
(“Plaintiff”) alleges that on April 3, 2023 Defendant AM Executive Group Inc.
(“AM Executive”) entered into a written Equipment Finance Agreement (“EFA”) with
Plaintiff’s assignor, Hampton Ridge Financial, LLC, for the finance of 147
Alexa Dining Chair-Chrome.  Plaintiff
alleges that Hampton assigned all of its rights, title, and interest in and to
the EFA to Plaintiff.  Plaintiff alleges
that AM Executive agreed to make payments as set forth in the EFA for 60
months.  Plaintiff alleges that on May
15, 2023, AM Executive failed to make the monthly payment, such that Plaintiff
has accelerated the receivable balance declaring all amounts due and
owing.  As of July 18, 2023, it alleges
that the total amount of rental payments owing, discounted at 4% pursuant to
paragraph 11, totals $35,242.20. 
Plaintiff also seeks additional charges for returned payment,
miscellaneous charges, and a termination fee, for a total of $28,062.95.
Plaintiff also alleges that Defendants
Artak V. Ghandilyan aka Artak Ghandilyan (“Ghandilyan”) and Arayik Arshakyan (“Arshakyan”)
executed a written Guaranty of the EFA.  Thus,
Plaintiff alleges that Ghandilyan and Arshakyan are indebted to Plaintiff in
the amount of $38,062.95. 
The complaint, filed July 26, 2023, alleges
causes of action for: (1) breach of written agreement; (2) breach of personal guaranty;
(3) open book account; (4) reasonable value; (5) account stated; (6)
indebtedness; (7) unjust enrichment; (8) claim and delivery; and (9)
conversion. 
B.    
Relevant
Background and Applications for Writs of Attachment 
On October 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed
proofs of service showing that the summons and complaint were served on
Defendants Ghandilyan, AM Executive, and Arshakyan by substituted service on
October 6, 2023 at 1:15 p.m. by leaving the documents with the person in
charge, Edgar Manissian, at 137 S. Glenoaks Blvd., Burbank, CA 91502.  The documents were thereafter mailed on
October 7, 2023.  Service was effectuated
by I. Anis, a registered California process server.  
On July 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed 3
applications for writ of attachment against Defendants Ghandilyan, AM
Executive, and Arshakyan.  
The Court is not in receipt of an
opposition brief from Defendants. 
LEGAL
STANDARD
“Upon the filing of the complaint or at
any time thereafter, the plaintiff may apply pursuant to this article for a
right to attach order and a writ of attachment by filing an application for the
order and writ with the court in which the action is brought.”  (CCP § 484.010.)
The application shall be executed under
oath and must include:
(1)              
a statement showing that the attachment is sought to secure
the recovery on a claim upon which an attachment may be issued;
(2)              
a statement of the amount to be secured by the attachment;
(3)              
a statement that the attachment is not sought for a purpose
other than the recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is based;
(4)              
a statement that the applicant has no information or belief
that the claim is discharged or that the prosecution of the action is stayed in
a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. section 101 et seq.); and 
(5)              
a description of the property to be attached under the writ
of attachment and a statement that the plaintiff is informed and believes that
such property is subject to attachment.
(CCP
§ 484.020.) 
“The application [for a writ of
attachment] shall be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on
the facts presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the
attachment is based.”  (CCP §
484.030.)  Statutory attachment procedures are purely
creations of the legislature and as such “are subject to ‘strict
construction.’”  (Hobbs v. Weiss
(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 76, 79 [citing Vershbow v. Reiner (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 879, 882]; see also Nakasone v. Randall (1982) 129 Cal.App.3d
757, 761.)  A judge does not have
authority to order any attachment that is not provided for by the attachment
statutes.  (Jordan-Lyon Productions, Ltd. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29
Cal.App.4th 1459, 1466.)  “The
declarations in the moving papers must contain evidentiary facts, stated ‘with particularity,’ and based on actual
personal knowledge with all documentary evidence properly identified and
authenticated.”  (Hobbs, supra, 73
Cal.App.4th at 79–80 [citing CCP § 482.040].)  “In contested applications, the court
must consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective parties
and make a determination of the probable outcome of the litigation.”  (Id. at 80 [ellipses and quotation marks omitted].)  “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is
more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the
defendant on that claim.”  (CCP §
481.190.)  
The Court shall issue a right to attach
order if the Court finds all of the following:
(1)              
The claim upon which the attachment is based is one upon
which an attachment may be issued.
(2)              
The plaintiff has established the probable validity of the
claim upon which the attachment is based.
(3)              
The attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the
recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is based.
(4)              
The amount to be secured by the attachment is greater than
zero.
(CCP § 484.090(a).)  
A claim of exemption must describe the
property to be exempted and specify the statute section supporting the
claim.  (CCP § 484.070(c).)  The plaintiff has the burden of opposing the
defendant’s claim of exemption, and if the plaintiff fails to oppose a claim of
exemption, “no right to attach order or writ of attachment shall be issued as
to the property claimed to be exempted.” 
(CCP § 484.070(f).)
DISCUSSION

A.    Probable
Validity of Plaintiff’s Claims
Plaintiff’s application
for writ of attachment against Defendants Ghandilyan, AM Executive, and
Arshakyan.  
“The standard elements of a claim for
breach of contract are: “(1) the contract, (2) plaintiff's performance or
excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) damage to plaintiff therefrom.
[Citation.]”  (Wall
Street Network, Ltd. v. New York Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171,
1178.)  
In support of the application, Plaintiff
provides the declaration of Kenny Fitzgerald, who is employed by Plaintiff and
Vice President Legal and Asset Management. 
(Fitzgerald Decl., ¶1.)  Mr. Fitzgerald
states that he is the custodian of records. 
(Id., ¶¶2-3.)  
Mr. Fitzgerald states that on April 3,
2023, Hampton entered into the EFA with AM Executive for the finance of 147
Alexa Dining Chair-Chrome.  (Fitzgerald
Decl., ¶4.)  The EFA was assigned to
Plaintiff. (Id.)  Pursuant to the
EFA, AM Executive is further liable to Plaintiff for taxes, fees, charges, and
other obligations.  (Id.,
¶6.)  On May 15, 2023, AM Executive
failed to make the monthly payment due and owing on the EFA, such that
Plaintiff has accelerated the receivable balance.  (Id., ¶8.)  As of July 18, 2023, the total amount of payments
owing under the EFA, discounted at 4% pursuant to paragraph 11, totals
$35,242.20.  (Id.)  He states that AM Executive is further liable
for returned payments of $675.44, other miscellaneous charges of $2,050.31, and
a termination fee of $95, creating a net payoff balance of $38,062.95, plus
interest at a rate of 24% per annum and legal fees and costs pursuant to
paragraph 11 of the EFA.  (Id., ¶¶9-11.)  Mr. Fitzgerald states that in order to induce
Hampton to enter the EFA, Ghandilyan and Arshakyan executed the written
Guaranty to the EFA.  (Id.,
¶12.)  As such, he states that these
individual Defendants are indebted to Plaintiff in the $38,062.95 amount, plus
interest and reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.  (Id., ¶¶13-14.)  A statement of account is attached as Exhibit
2.  (Id., ¶15, Ex. 2.)  Mr. Fitzgerald states that Plaintiff is
seeking $38,062.95, plus $2,000 in attorney’s fees, and $1,500 in costs, for a
total amount of $41,562.95.  (Id.,
¶17.)  
Based on the declaration of Mr. Fitzgerald,
the Court finds that Plaintiff has established the probable validity of its
breach of the EFA and Guaranty claims. 
Plaintiff has shown each of the elements of a breach of contract claims
by way of the declaration of Mr. Fitzgerald and the attached exhibits.  The motion is not opposed and no
contradictory evidence has been presented.
Accordingly, Plaintiff has established the
probable validity of its claims upon which the attachment is based.
B.     Basis
of Attachment
The Court shall issue a right to attach order
if the claim upon which the attachment is based is one upon which an attachment
may be issued.  (CCP § 484.090.)  “[A]n attachment may be issued only in an
action on a claim or claims for money, each of which is based upon a contract,
express or implied, where the total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or
readily ascertainable amount not less than five hundred dollars ($500) exclusive
of costs, interest, and attorney’s fees.” 
(CCP § 483.010(a).)  “If the
action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a claim which arises out of the conduct by the defendant of a
trade, business, or profession.”  (CCP §
483.010(c).)
This first requirement has been met. 
Plaintiff’s claim is based on Defendants’ outstanding debt owed to
Plaintiff as a result of breaches of the EFA and Guaranty.  The amount Plaintiff seeks to be secured by
the attachment is $41,562.95 (which includes attorney’s fees and costs), which
is greater than $500.00.  (See AT-105,
§8.)  
C.     Purpose and Amount of Attachment
CCP §
484.090(a)(3)-(4) states that the Court shall issue a right to attach order if
“the attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the
claim upon which the attachment is based . . . [and] the amount to be secured
by the attachment is greater than zero.”
In this case, Plaintiff attests on AT-105 Forms
that the attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on a
claim upon which the attachment is based. 
(AT-105, §4.)  Also, it is clear
from the evidence presented that the amount to be secured is greater than
zero.  There is no indication that the
application is sought for any other purpose, and Defendants do not argue that
the action is brought for any other purpose. 

Accordingly, the Court determines that Plaintiff has complied with CCP
§§ 484.020 and 484.090.
D.    Subject
Property
CCP § 484.020(e)
provides, as follows:
Where the defendant is a corporation,
a reference to “all corporate property which is subject to attachment pursuant
to subdivision (a) of Code of Civil Procedure Section 487.010” satisfies the
requirements of this subdivision. Where the defendant is a partnership or other unincorporated association, a reference to “all
property of the partnership or other unincorporated association which
is subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (b) of Code of
Civil Procedure Section 487.010” satisfies the requirements of this
subdivision. Where the defendant is a natural person, the
description of the property shall be reasonably adequate to permit the
defendant to identify the specific property sought to be attached.
(CCP
§ 484.020(e).)  
            Plaintiff seeks the following
property from Defendant AM Executive: “Any property of a defendant who is not
a natural person.”  (AT-105 Form re AM
Executive, ¶9(a).)
Plaintiff seeks the following property
from Defendant Ghandilyan: “(1) Deposit accounts pursuant to CCP Section
488.455; (2) Any accounts receivable or general intangibles pursuant to CCP
Section 488.470; (3) Real property pursuant to CCP Section 488.315 and/or
488.415 – commonly known as 7978 Bellaire Avenue, North Hollywood, CA 91605,
and legally described on the attached Grant Deed.”  (AT-105 Form re Ghandilyan, ¶9(c).)  
Plaintiff seeks the following property
from Defendant Arshakyan: “(1) Deposit accounts pursuant to CCP Section
488.455; (2) Any accounts receivable or general intangibles pursuant to CCP
Section 488.470; (3) Real property pursuant to CCP Section 488.315 and/or
488.415.”  (AT-105 Form re Arshakyan,
¶9(c).) 
Plaintiff has properly described the
property sought to be attached. (See CCP § 487.010.)
E.     Exemptions
As the motions are
not opposed, Defendants have not stated whether they are claiming an
entitlement to any exemptions. 
Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendants are not entitled to any
exemptions.  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Plaintiff’s applications for writ of
attachment against Defendants AM Executive Group Inc., Artak V. Ghandilyan aka
Artak Ghandilyan, and Arayik Arshakyan are granted in the total amount of $36,012.64.  At this time, the Court declines to grant the
writs of attachment for miscellaneous fees ($2,050.31), attorney’s fees
($2,000) and costs ($1,500) incurred to bring the applications.  
CCP § 489.210 requires the plaintiff to
file an undertaking before issuance of a writ of attachment.  CCP § 489.220 provides that “the amount of an
undertaking filed pursuant to this article shall be ten thousand dollars
($10,000).”  The Court may increase this
amount “to the amount it determines to be the probable recovery for wrongful
attachment if it is ultimately determined that the attachment was
wrongful.”  (CCP § 489.220(b).)  Accordingly, upon granting the applications,
Plaintiff is ordered to post an undertaking in the amount of $10,000.00 prior
to the issuance of the writs of attachment against Defendant. 
Plaintiff shall
provide notice of this order.
