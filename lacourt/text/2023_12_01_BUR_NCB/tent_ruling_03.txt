[1] The third
affirmative defense is for Anticipatory Repudiation, which alleges: “These
answering Defendants are informed and believe and on such information and
belief allege that Plaintiff breached his contract, if any, with Defendants,
and that by reason of said breach of contract, Defendants have been excused of
their duties to perform all obligations set forth in said contract.”  


[2] See October 1,
2021 Answer at 4-5.  Defendants filed the
answer as self-represented litigants.
 


[3] See Evidence Code
§ 412. 
 


[4] If the direction
to file a cross-complaint was made at the outset of the representation, it is
likely that it would have been mentioned in the retainer agreement regarding
the scope of services. Yet that agreement is not produced. 
 


[5]
It
is true that by placing their communications with counsel in issue, Defendants
have waived the attorney-client privilege, but not as broadly as Plaintiff’s
counsel suggests. The privilege has been waived as to any communications or
work-product that mention the cross-complaint. If such communications were
truly made, they should have been produced in support of the motion.

minute order of August 18, 2023.
