[TENTATIVE] order RE:
motion for attorney’s fees 



 
BACKGROUND
A.    Allegations of the
Operative Complaint 
On February 14,
2023, Plaintiff Milan REI VIII, LLC (“Plaintiff”) commenced this unlawful
detainer action against Defendant Claudia Cota, an individual dba Legal Action
Group & Associates, Inc. (“Defendant”). 

The action involves
the properties located at 6400 Laurel Canyon Blvd., Suite 540, in North
Hollywood, CA 91606.  Plaintiff alleges
that on January 5, 2022, Defendant agreed to rent the premises at a monthly
rent of $5,418 pursuant to a written agreement with Plaintiff.  Pursuant to the lease terms, Defendant’s rent
would be reduced by 50% until November 1, 2022. 
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant was served with a 3-day notice to pay
rent or quit and that on February 7, 2023, the period stated in the notice
expired.  Plaintiff alleges that at the
time of the 3-day notice, the amount of rent due was $35,217.  Plaintiff seeks possession of the premises,
costs incurred in this proceeding, past due rent of $35,217, reasonable attorney’s
fees, forfeiture of the agreement, and damages at the fair rental value of the
premises of $180.60 per day starting January 1, 2023.      
B.     Relevant Background
On May 5, 2023,
the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment. 
On May 9, 2023,
judgment was entered in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant, such that
Plaintiff was awarded possession of the commercial premises and monetary
damages in the amount of $52,374. 
C.     Motion on Calendar

On July 6, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a motion for attorney’s fees seeking $8,563 against Defendant.  
The Court is not
in receipt of a written opposition brief. 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff moves
for attorney’ fees against Defendant in the total amount of $8,563.00. 
A.   
Entitlement to Attorney’s Fees
Plaintiff
relies on the fee provision in the lease as the basis for attorney’s fees.  The lease states in relevant part:
In any action to enforce the terms of this
Lease, including any suit by Landlord for the recovery of rent or possession of
the Premises, the losing party shall pay the successful party a reasonable sum
for attorneys’ fees and costs in such suit and such attorneys’ fees and costs
shall be deemed to have accrued prior to the commencement of such action and shall
be paid whether or not such action is prosecuted to judgment.
(Corey E. Taylor Decl., Ex. A [Lease, § 31.2(i)].)  
Here, the lease
agreement provides for a basis of attorney’s fees for this action.  Plaintiff is the prevailing party in this
action as judgement was entered in Plaintiff’s favor following its motion for
summary judgment, such that Plaintiff was entitled to possession of the
premises and damages in the form of unpaid rent.  As the prevailing party, Plaintiff is
entitled to fees pursuant to the parties’ contract.  
B.    
Reasonableness of Attorney’s Fees 
Plaintiff seeks $8,563
in attorney’s fees against
Defendant.  In support of the request, Plaintiff
provides the declaration of its counsel, Mr. Taylor. 
Mr. Taylor provides the breakdown of his billing in connection with the
action.  (Taylor Decl., ¶¶7-12.)  He states that she has been an attorney since
1995 and provides his experience.  (Id.,
¶¶13-14.)  Mr. Taylor states that his standard
billing rate is $495/hour, but he charged a reduced rate of $395/hour from
March 1, 2023 and then increased it to $425/hour thereafter, which he believes
is standard in the legal community and for the landlord-tenant practice in
particular.  (Id., ¶15.)  He states:
“The total fees sought
here consist of .7 hours of my time at $395 per hour ($276.50), 11.1 hours of
my time at $425 per hour ($4,717.50), 10.6 hours of associate attorney time at
$295 per hour ($3,127.00), .5 hours of paralegal time at $150 per hour ($75)
and 2.1 hours of paralegal time at $175 per hour ($367.50). Thus, the total
fees sought by Plaintiff here through today are $8,563.50.”  (Id.)  He provides his firm’s billing records/invoices
as Exhibit C.  (Id., ¶7, Ex.
C.)   
The Court has
reviewed the billing records and finds that the tasks performed and the time
spent by counsel and his staff on this action are reasonable.  Further, the Court finds that Mr. Taylor’s
hourly rates are reasonable in light of his experience and the work performed
in this action. 
Accordingly, the
motion for attorney’s fees is granted in the amount requested.  
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER 
Plaintiff Milan
REI VIII, LLC’s motion for attorney’s fees is granted in the amount of
$8,563.00.
Plaintiff shall provide
notice of this ruling.

is dependent on numerous inconstant and fluctuating factors that may impact
whether you, or other counsel or the Court itself can be heard in a particular

where they cannot be heard and where the courtroom staff is not aware of their
