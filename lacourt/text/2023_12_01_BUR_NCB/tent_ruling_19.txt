[1] The Probate Action’s complaint, Petitioners Diana
Gomez and William Antonio Barrera, Jr. allege causes of action for: (1) to invalidate
amendment and restatement of the Barrera 1996 Trust Agreement; (2) to
invalidate 2022 amendment; (3) for an order for return of trust property to
Trust (Probate Code, §§ 850, 856, 859); (4) cancellation of instruments; (5) breach
of duties of trustees (Probate Code, § 16000 et seq.); (6) an order
compelling trustees to account and disclose trust information; (7) an order
compelling trustees to turnover trust’s books and records; (8) removal of
trustee of original trust and appointment of successor trustee; (9) surcharge
of trustee; (10) imposition of constructive trust (Civil Code, §§ 2223 and
2224); (11) enforcement of the terms of the original Trust; (12) IIED; and (13)
injunctive relief.  


[2] On page 5 of the opposition papers, Plaintiff argues
that “Judge Kralik found in Case No. 22BBCV00328 that the lis pendens
Defendants recorded did not affect ‘the title or right of possession of real
property, as authorized or regulated by law.’” 
The Court has reviewed its February 27, 2013 and June 16, 2023 orders in
the First Action and finds that it did not make this statement as represented
by Plaintiff.  In the prior orders on the
motion to expunge lis pendens and the demurrer to the TAC in the First
Action, the Court did not discuss the litigation privilege pursuant to Civil
Code, § 47.  In addition, the Court only
discussed the quiet title cause of action as asserted in First Action (i.e.,
whether title would be affected) and did not discuss the right of
possession because the Court only discussed the quiet title cause of action. 


[3] CCP § 405.36 states: “Once a
notice of pending action has been expunged, the claimant may not record another
notice of pending action as to the affected property without leave of the court
in which the action is pending.”  Defendants
did not refile/re-record a lis pendens in the First Action, but instead
filed another lis pendens in the separately filed Probate Action.
