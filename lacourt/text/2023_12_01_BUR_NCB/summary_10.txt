Summary:

The Tentative Ruling is regarding a motion to set aside/vacate the entry of default and a motion to strike portions of the complaint. The case involves a negligence claim against Beacon Management, Inc. and Larry Goldberg, alleging that they were negligent in managing the real property located at 11331-11337 Ventura Blvd. in Studio City, CA. The plaintiff, X Alexander, was an invitee on the property when he fell into a hole on the pathway. The default was entered on March 14, 2023, and Beacon filed a motion to set aside the default, alleging that the default was caused by its agent's failure to forward the summons and complaint. The Court grants the motion to set aside the default, but imposes a penalty of $1,000 on Beacon for its negligence. The motion to strike is continued.
