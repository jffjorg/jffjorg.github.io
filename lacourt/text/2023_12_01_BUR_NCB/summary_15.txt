And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel further responses from Defendant Artur Hovsepyan. The motion was filed by Plaintiff Nicharaporn Chantraramat, who is seeking Hovsepyan's further responses to Request for Production No. 22 (RPD No. 22). The Plaintiff argues that Hovsepyan's response to RPD No. 22 is unverified and therefore tantamount to no response at all. The Judge agrees and grants the motion, ordering Hovsepyan to provide a verification of his response to RPD No. 22. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff's request for sanctions against Hovsepyan is improper, as it was directed against Margaryan, a different defendant.
