And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the ex parte application to amend the Complaint to add derivative claims against Same Jadtar LP, a new nominal defendant. The trial date will need to be vacated pending the completion of appraisals for the additional derivative claims. The judge believes it is in the interests of justice to add the new defendant and include the additional claims in the appraisal. The delay in seeking the amendment and the fact that the defendants' legal strategy was based on the prior allegations do not outweigh the need to add the new defendant.
