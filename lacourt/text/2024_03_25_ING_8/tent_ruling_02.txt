CASE
NUMBER:                          22TRCV00273 
 
CASE
NAME:                               David
Zimmerman v Jay and Thomas Zimmerman
 
TRIAL
DATE:                                 April
22, 2024
 
MOTION: 
                                   Ex
parte application to amend Complaint to add derivative claims as to the
additional entity Same Jadtar LP
 
TENTATIVE RULINGS:               Granted.  The trial date will need to be vacated
pending an estimate completion date for the appraisals of these additional derivative
claims, but it appears to be in the interests of justice (notwithstanding the
delay in seeking the amendment and notwithstanding the fact that defendants’
legal strategy had been based on the prior allegations) to add nominal
defendant Sam Jadtar LP and direct the appraisers to include these additional derivative
claims to the claims the appraisers are already assessing.
