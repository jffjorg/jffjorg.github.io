And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively granted the ex parte application of Matrix Service, Inc. for an order compelling answers to deposition questions and production of documents by Orlando Carbajal. The court finds that the deponent's refusal to answer questions at his deposition was improper and that further discovery is necessary to determine whether all responsive documents have been produced in discovery. The court notes that the deponent verified Matrix's discovery responses and that further discovery can be directed to the deponent to determine the sources of the initial responses. The court also finds that the instructions to the deponent not to answer questions were without merit and a misuse of the discovery process. The court orders that the deponent be required to answer questions and produce documents prior to the filing of Matrix's motion for summary judgment opposition.
