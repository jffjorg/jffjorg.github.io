RELIEF REQUESTED
Defendant, Erlich, moves for judgment on the pleadings as to Plaintiff Oshein
Khachikian’s Complaint as follows:
“(1) As to the Complaint pursuant to Code Civ. Proc.

cause of action as the Complaint and the sole cause of action alleged therein
is precluded due to the failure to file a Certificate of Merit as required
under Code Civ. Proc. section 411.35.
This
Motion will be based on this Notice, the attached Memorandum of Points and
Authorities, the Request for Judicial Notice served herewith, the Declaration
of Zachary Law, the complete files and records of this action, and on such oral
argument as the Court may entertain at the hearing of this Motion.”

TENTATIVE RULING
On 07/25/2023,
Plaintiff, Oshein Khachikian, filed a Complaint alleging two causes of action
for: (1) Breach of Contract, and (2) Negligence. The breach of contract cause
of action was alleged against Defendant LA CCS, Inc., and the negligence cause
of action was alleged against all Defendants – LA CCS, Inc., and Erlich
Architect.
Defendant,
Erlich, filed the instant moving papers on 01/08/2024.
On
01/23/2024, the Court held proceedings for an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure
to File Proof of Service. 
The
January 23, 2024 Minute Order states:
The above matter is called for hearing.
 
The Court and counsel confer regarding the order to show cause.
 
The Court rules as follows:
 
The OSC re: proof of service is discharged and vacated.
 
The Motion for Judgement on the pleadings is withdrawn by the
moving party.
 
The matter remains on calendar as previously set for 3/18/2024.
 
Notice is waived.
 
(Min. Order Jan. 23, 2024.)
 
Although the January 23, 2024 Minute Order does
not state who the moving party is with respect to the motion for judgment on
the pleadings, presumably the Court was referring to Defendant Erlich because
the only motion for judgment on the pleadings that was filed in this case was
filed by Defendant Erlich on January 8, 2024.
 
Therefore, the Court DENIES this motion as moot for
being withdrawn by the moving party at the January 23, 2024 hearing pertaining
to the Order to Show Cause RE: Failure to File Proof of Service.
