And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further responses from defendant FCA US LLC. The plaintiff, Danitza Maravilla Torres and Andres Morales Rios, had filed a motion to compel further responses to their requests for production, alleging that defendant had failed to provide code-compliant responses. The Judge found that the motion was timely and that defendant had provided supplemental responses to the instant requests, making the motion to compel further responses moot. However, the Judge did not deny the motion as moot as to the issue of sanctions, as defendant had only provided supplemental responses after the plaintiff had filed the motion. The Judge will hear argument on the issue of sanctions, which the plaintiff is seeking in the amount of $2610.00.
