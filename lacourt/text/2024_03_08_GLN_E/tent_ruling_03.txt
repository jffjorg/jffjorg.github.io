Trial Date: 03/11/2025
Case Name: FELIX CRUZ v. GENERAL MOTORS LLC, a Delaware
Limited Liability Company, and DOES 1-10 inclusive
 
[TENTATIVE RULING ON
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER]
TENTATIVE RULING
The instant hearing pertains to Plaintiff, Felix Cruz,
moving to compel further responses to Plaintiff’s first set of Requests for
Production of Documents and monetary sanctions against Defendant, General
Motors, LLC, and its attorneys of record.
It does not appear as if this motion scheduled for 03/08/2024
should be heard in Department E of the Glendale Courthouse.
On 1/30/2024, a Notice of Case Reassignment was filed
by Plaintiff. In the Notice of Case Reassignment, attached as Exhibit 1 is a
“Notice of Case Reassignment And Order For Plaintiff to Give Notice (Dates
Remain).”
In relevant part, it states:
You are hereby
notified that effective 02/05/2024, an order was made that the above-entitled
action, previously assigned to Ashfaq G. Chowdhury, is now and shall be
assigned to Sarah J. Heidel as an Individual Calendar (IC), direct calendaring
judge for all purposes, including trial, in department V at Alhambra
Courthouse. (See Chapter 3, Los Angeles Court Rules) All matters on calendar in
this case will remain set on the dates previously noticed, in the department
indicated above unless otherwise ordered by the court.
 
(Not. Case
Reassign.. Ex. 1.)
Therefore, although the notice of
reassignment states that all matters in this case remain set on the dates
previously noticed, the notice states that those matters are in the department
indicated above – in this notice, the department indicated is Dept. V at the
Alhambra Courthouse. Further, the notice indicates that it is effective
02/05/2024. Therefore, since the instant hearing is set for 03/08/2024, this motion
appears as if it should be heard in Dept V at the Alhambra Courthouse.  Motion is rescheduled to 05/02/24 @ 8:30 A.M. in Dept. V at the Alhambra Courthouse.
