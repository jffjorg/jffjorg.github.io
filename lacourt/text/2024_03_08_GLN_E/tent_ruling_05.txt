RELIEF REQUESTED¿ 


“Cross-Defendant, MERI ISKANDARYAN,
will move the Court for an Order compelling Cross-Complainant, LA COUNTY
METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY, to serve answers to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, which were served on the Cross-Complainant on August
17, 2023, and will further move this Court for an order requiring
Cross-Complainant LA COUNTY METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY and/or its
attorneys Joel F. Citron, Esq. and Thomas H. Citron at the CITRON & CITRON
Law Firm to pay to Cross-Defendant, MERI ISKANDARYAN his reasonable expenses,
including attorney’s fees, incurred in obtaining this order in the amount of
$461.65.
 
The motion will be made on the
grounds that Cross-Complainant has not responded to this discovery request,
that the information sought by said request is relevant to the subject matter
involved in the pending action or is reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence and is not privileged, and that the failure of
Cross-Complainant to respond to this discovery request is without substantial
justification. The motion will be based on this notice of motion, on the
Declaration of ANNA SARGSYAN served and filed herewith, on the Memorandum of
Points and Authorities served and filed herewith, on the papers and records on
file herein, and on such oral and documentary evidence as may be presented at
the hearing of the motion.”
 
Procedural


16/21 Day Lapse (CCP § 12c and § 1005(b): Ok
Proof of Service Timely Filed (CRC, rule 3.1300): Ok
Correct Address (CCP § 1013, § 1013a): Yes/No – Moving party, Cross-Defendant,
did not serve the moving papers on the email address that is listed on eCourt
for Cross-Complainant’s counsel. However, Cross-Complainant submitted an
untimely declaration in Opposition that essentially opposed this motion. The
Cross-Complainant’s declaration did not argue that the instant motion was not
served at the proper email address; the declaration argued why the instant
motion should not be granted. 
LEGAL STANDARD –
COMPEL RESPONSES, INTERROGATORIES


Within 30 days after service
of interrogatories, the party to whom the interrogatories are propounded shall
serve the original of the response to them on the propounding party, unless on
motion of the propounding party the court has shortened the time for response,
or unless on motion of the responding party the court has extended the time for
response. (CCP § 2030.260(a).)
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the party propounding the interrogatories may move
for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (CCP § 2030.290(b).)
“The party to whom the interrogatories are directed
waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section
2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based
on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing
with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this
waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are
satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial
compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. (2) The
party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 2030.290(a).)
Unlike a motion to compel further responses, a motion
to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding
party does not have to demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a
“meet and confer” requirement. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404 [citing Weil
and Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group
2006) ¶¶8:1137 to 8:1144, pp. 8F-59 to 8F-60, ¶¶ 8:1483 to 8:1489, pp. 8H-29 to
hH-30].)
ANALYSIS

Cross-Defendant,
Meri Iskandaryan (Movant), argues that initial responses to her Form
Interrogatories, Set One, have not been received; therefore, responses should
be compelled. Movant does not state which statute she is moving under as her
legal authority to compel responses, she simply states that discovery was
served, and since no responses have been received, the Court should compel
responses. Presumably, Movant is implying that since initial responses were not
received within 30 days, Movant is entitled to responses. [To compel initial
responses to form interrogatories, the appropriate code section is CCP §2030.290.]


A formal opposition was not submitted by the opposing party (Cross-Complainant,
Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority), but a declaration
was submitted by its counsel, Joel F. Citron. Presumably the opposition
intended for the declaration to be its opposition. This opposition was
submitted late. This declaration states that initial responses were submitted
timely and provides the proofs of service for its initial responses to the form
interrogatories,
TENTATIVE RULING


The Court’s inclination is to DENY the motion, but the
Court will hear argument.
Sanctions

In
the motion to compel responses to form interrogatories, Movant does not cite to
the appropriate code section of § 2030.290(c) to request sanctions. Movant
simply cites to § 2030.030 in general as its basis for requesting sanctions.
Movant does not even state the specific sub-section of § 2030.030 as to what
its basis it is requesting sanctions. 
Plaintiff should have moved for sanctions under § 2030.290(c).
Section 2030.290 states in relevant part:
The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(CCP § 2030.290(c).)
 
“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act
in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).) 
The Court will hear argument as to Movant’s request
for sanctions in the amount of $461.65.

LEGAL STANDARD – COMPEL RESPONSES, INSPECTION DEMANDS


Within 30 days after service of a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the party to whom the demand is
directed shall serve the original of the response to it on the party making the
demand, and a copy of the response on all other parties who have appeared in
the action, unless on motion of the party making the demand, the court has
shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the party to whom the
demand has been directed, the court has extended the time for response. (CCP § 2031.260(a).)
If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
demand. (CCP § 2031.300(b).)
If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). (CCP § 2031.300(a).) “The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions
are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in
substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240,
and 2031.280. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result
of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP  § 2031.300(a)(1)-(2).)
Unlike a motion to compel further responses, a motion

And Inspection of Documents, Set One, have not been received; therefore,
responses should be compelled. Movant does not state which statute she is

requests for production.

TENTATIVE RULING MOTION 2

The
Court inclination is to DENY the motion, but the Court will hear argument.


Sanctions


Movant cites to § 2031.310, without specifying a
specific subsection, as its legal authority for requesting sanctions.
Confusingly, § 2031.310 pertains to compelling further responses
and not initial responses to requests for production, so it is
unclear why Movant cites this section as its legal authority for requesting
sanctions. Movant should have cited to 2031.300(c).
In relevant part, § 2031.300(c) states as follows:
Except as provided
in subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(CCP § 2031.300(c).)
 
“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act
in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).) 
The Court will hear
argument as to Movant’s request for sanctions in the amount of $461.65.
