BACKGROUND
This
case does not arise from a Complaint. On 11/10/2022, Petitioners filed a
Petition. 
The caption of the Petition requested as follows:
PETITION
FOR ORDERS SUMMARILY:
 
1.
AUTHORIZING THE USE OF THIRD-PARTY ELECTION AGENT [Civil Code § 5103, § 5105
and § 5110 and Corporations Code § 7510(c) et seq.]
 
2.
AUTHORIZING A SPECIAL MEETING OF MEMBERS CALLED BY 5% PERCENT OR MORE OF THE
MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION [Corporations Code § 7510(e)] and,
 
3.
SETTING A DATE CERTAIN FOR THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION AND ELECTIONS
OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THEREAFTER, ENFORCING PROCEDURES AND ELECTION
RESULTS [Corporations Code § 7510(c), § 7515, § 7616 and § 7520 et seq.]
 
(Petition
filed 11/10/2022, p.1.)
 
This
action arose when Petitioners, owners/members of Woodglen Homeowners
Association, alleged that Respondent, Woodglen Homeowners Association, through
its then allegedly rogue Board of Directors, repeatedly refused to hold a
lawfully mandated annual meeting and election and interfered with Petitioners
efforts to conduct one. According to the “Preliminary Statement” section of
this motion, the purpose of the Petition was to obtain a Court order to ensure
that an election of the Board of Directors of Woodglen Homeowners Association
took place on a date certain, with use of an authorized third-party election
agent, and that the results of said election be enforced by the Court.
 
The
Petition was granted on February 3, 2023. 
 
On
February 14, 2023, the Hon. David A. Rosen of this Court signed the Order After
Hearing on Petition.
 
On
August 14, 2023, the Hon. David A. Rosen of this Court signed the Amended Order
After Election.
 
On
August 16, 2023, Petitioners served and filed the Notice of Entry of Judgment
or Order.
 
TENTATIVE
RULING
The
Court will hear from the parties at the hearing. 
 
In
Petitioners’ motion, Petitioners state that Respondent, Woodglen Homeowners
Association, “has acknowledged that all efforts undertaken by the Petitioners  prior to and including with this Petition (as
defined below) were for the benefit of the community as a whole and have agreed
that Petitioners are entitled to reimbursement of their expenses in their
entirety, which amounts the Association has since agreed that Petitioners are
entitled to full reimbursement for.” (Pet. Mot. p. 6.) 
 
Further,
Petitioners filed a Stipulation and a Proposed Order on the Stipulation on
2/13/2024.
 
This
Stipulation was titled “Stipulation to Dismiss Case with the Court Retaining
Jurisdiction Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 664.6.”
 
In
relevant part, the Stipulation states:
 
1.
The parties have entered into a written settlement agreement and stipulation
for judgment which provides that judgment shall only be entered in the event
the Association defaults on the settlement agreement and stipulation for
judgment. 
 
2.
The parties agree and request that the case be dismissed without prejudice
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 664.6 with the Court retaining
jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement and stipulation for judgment. 
 
3.
This stipulation may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and
the same  instrument. In addition, signed
copies of this stipulation exchanged via electronic transmission, including,
without limitation, facsimile, email or photocopy shall be deemed originals and
delivered for all purposes.
 
(Stip.
filed 02/13/2024.)
 
In light of the proposed
stipulation, the fact that there was no Opposition to this motion, and that
Petitioners allege that Respondent agreed that Petitioners are entitled to full
reimbursement, the Court will hear argument. 
The Court is
unclear if  the parties intend for the
motion for attorney’s fees to be taken off calendar as moot if the Court signs
the proposed stipulation. 
 
If so, the Court
likely has no problem with signing the stipulation and denying the motion for
attorney’s fees as moot.
 
The Court also
would like the parties to address how this Stipulation, if signed by the Court,
affects the August 16, 2023 Notice of Judgment or Order. 
 
The Court would
like the parties to address this because the Stipulation states in ¶1 that “The
parties have entered into a written settlement agreement and stipulation for
judgment which provides that judgment shall only be entered in the event the
Association defaults on the settlement agreement and stipulation for judgment.”
(Stip. filed 02/13/2024; italics added.) 
 
The Court is
uncertain whether the parties are attempting to stipulate that the prior Notice
of Judgment or Order is no longer in effect based on the proposed stipulation. 
 
The Court is
inclined to GRANT the unopposed motion, but the Court will hear from the
parties.
