And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling regarding the motion to compel further responses to Requests for Production of Documents filed by the plaintiff, Felix Cruz. The plaintiff is seeking monetary sanctions against the defendant, General Motors LLC, and its attorneys of record. The judge has determined that the hearing scheduled for March 8, 2024, should be rescheduled to May 2, 2024, at 8:30 A.M. in Dept. V at the Alhambra Courthouse. This is because the case was reassigned to a different department and courthouse on February 5, 2024, and the notice of case reassignment states that all matters in the case will remain set on the dates previously noticed, but in the department indicated in the notice, which is Dept. V at the Alhambra Courthouse.
