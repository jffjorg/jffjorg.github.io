Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion for attorney's fees and costs filed by petitioners, Traci Ann Curtis-De Rago, Margarita Hirapetian, Roubina Malayan, Edgardo P. Rosales, and Nazly Bim. The petitioners seek to recover $149,948.75 in attorney's fees and $1,087.45 in costs as the prevailing party in the case. The respondent, Woodglen Homeowners Association, has not filed an opposition to the motion.

The court is inclined to grant the motion, but is uncertain if the parties intend for the motion to be taken off calendar as moot if the court signs the proposed stipulation to dismiss the case with the court retaining jurisdiction. The court would like the parties to address how the stipulation, if signed by the court, affects the August 16, 2023 Notice of Judgment or Order.

The court will hear argument from the parties at the hearing and will make a final ruling on the motion.
