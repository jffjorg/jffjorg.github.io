Summary:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to vacate the notice of entry of judgment on sister-state judgment entered on May 18, 2023. The plaintiff seeks to vacate the judgment based on the voidness of the default judgment in the Nevada Case, which was obtained during a bankruptcy stay. The court notes that it is skeptical about its authority to vacate the judgment under CCP § 1710.40(a) and that the motion was not made "not later than 30 days after service of notice of entry of judgment" as required by CCP § 1710.40(b). However, the court grants the motion as a practical matter since the judgment was in favor of the plaintiff and the defendant does not oppose the motion.
