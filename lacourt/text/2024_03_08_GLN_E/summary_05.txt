And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is to deny the motion to compel response to interrogatories and demand for production, but the court will hear argument on the issue. The judge notes that the Cross-Defendant, Meri Iskandaryan, has not stated which statute she is moving under as her legal authority to compel responses, and that the Cross-Complainant, LA County Metro Trans Authority, has failed to respond to discovery requests. The judge also notes that the Cross-Complainant submitted an untimely declaration in opposition to the motion, which did not argue that the instant motion was not served at the proper email address.

The judge is inclined to deny the motion because the Cross-Complainant has submitted a declaration stating that initial responses were submitted timely and providing proofs of service for its initial responses to the requests for production. The judge notes that the Cross-Defendant has not cited the appropriate code section as its legal authority for requesting sanctions and has not stated the specific subsection of § 2030.030 as to what its basis it is requesting sanctions.

The judge will also hear argument on the issue of sanctions, as the Cross-Defendant has requested sanctions in the amount of $461.65.
