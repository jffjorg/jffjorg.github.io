And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on December 13, 2023, regarding a motion to compel responses to a request for admissions filed by Defendant Ronald Smothers against Plaintiff Jason Mota. The motion is granted, and Plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses without objections within 20 days of notice of the ruling. Additionally, the Judge orders Plaintiff to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $260 within 30 days of the order. The dispute arose when Defendant served a request for admissions on March 1, 2023, and Plaintiff failed to provide verified responses, despite serving unverified responses on May 16, 2023. The Judge cites California Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280(c) in support of the ruling, which provides for mandatory sanctions in connection with a motion to deem the truth of the matter in the requests for admissions admitted.
