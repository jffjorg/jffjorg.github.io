And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to consolidate cases 22STCV31782 and 22STCV33087 without prejudice. The motion was filed by Plaintiff Robert Ochoa, who seeks to consolidate the two cases, which involve identical causes of action for negligence and negligence per se arising from two separate motor vehicle accidents. The Judge finds that the cases are related and involve similar issues of law and fact, but denies the motion due to procedural deficiencies, including the failure to list all named parties, parties who have appeared in the actions, and the names of their respective attorneys of record in the notice of motion to consolidate.
