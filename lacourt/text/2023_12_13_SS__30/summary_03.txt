And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied. The plaintiff failed to file an amended complaint within the period allotted by the court, but the defendant did not move for judgment on the pleadings based on the ground that the court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the complaint or the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the defendant. Instead, the defendant moved for judgment on the pleadings based on the plaintiff's failure to file an amended complaint. The court notes that the meet and confer requirements have not been met, but this is not a ground to deny the motion. The court finds that the motion is denied on procedural grounds, and the court will address the merits of the parties' arguments in the motion to strike.
