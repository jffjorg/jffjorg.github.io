 Case Number:  22STCV00377    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2023    Dept:  30 JASON MOTA, AN INDIVIDUAL vs RONALD SMOTHERS, AN INDIVIDUALMotion to Compel Responses to Request for AdmissionsTENTATIVEDefendant Ronald Smothers’ motion to compel responses to request for admissions is GRANTED. Plaintiff Jason Mota is ordered to serve verified responses without objections within 20 days of notice of ruling.Defendant’s request for sanctions is GRANTED. The Court orders Plaintiff Jason Mota to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $260 within 30 days of this order.Moving party is ordered to give notice.DiscussionOn March 1, 2023, Defendant served Request for Admissions, Set One, on Plaintiff. (Mullen Decl., ¶ 2; Exh. A.) On May 16, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel served unverified Responses to Request for Admissions, Set One. (Id., Exh. B.) No verified responses were provided.Because Defendant properly served the requests for discovery, and Plaintiff has failed to provide verified responses, the Court finds Defendant is entitled to an order compelling verified responses without objections to the request for admissions served on Plaintiff. The motion is granted.Defendant also requests sanctions. Sanctions are mandatory in connection with a motion to deem the truth of the matter in the requests for admissions admitted. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).) Thus, the request for sanctions in connection with this motion is granted. However, the amount awarded is reduced due to the simplicity of this motion and lack of opposition. As such, the Court imposes sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $260 ($200 per hour for one hour, plus $60 filing fee) to be paid within 30 days of this order.
