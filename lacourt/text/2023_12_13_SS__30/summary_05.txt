And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, ruling that West Palm Detox, a non-medical adult residential detox treatment facility, did not owe a duty of care to the public to protect it from the criminal acts of its residents. The judge found that the defendant relied on the case of Rice v. Center Point, Inc. (2007), which held that a residential rehabilitation facility did not owe a duty to the public to protect it from the criminal acts of its residents. The judge also found that the plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence or legal authority to rebut or distinguish the holdings in Rice. As a result, the judge granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment and deemed the issue of punitive damages moot.
