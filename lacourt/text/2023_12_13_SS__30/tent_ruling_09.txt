 Case Number:  22STCV31782    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2023    Dept:  30 ROBERT OCHOA vs EVAN TAKESHI TSUJI, et al.Motion to ConsolidateTENTATIVEThe motion to consolidate is DENIED without prejudice. Moving party to give notice.BackgroundOn September 28, 2022, Plaintiff Robert Ochoa filed a complaint against Defendants Evan Takeshi Tsuhi, and Joni Tsuji, alleging causes of action for negligence, and negligence per se, arising out of a collision that occurred on October 30, 2021, in Arcadia.On October 7, 2022, in case number 22STCV33087, Plaintiff Robert Ochoa filed a complaint against Defendants Victoria Gonzalez, and Louis Joseph Gonzalez, alleging causes of action for negligence, and negligence per se, arising out of a collision that occurred on December 10, 2021.On November 2, 2023, this Court found that these two actions are related.On October 26, 2023, Plaintiff Robert Ochoa filed the instant motion to consolidate. No opposition has been filed.  DiscussionPlaintiff moves for consolidation of this case with 22STCV33087, arguing that both incidents involve bodily injury incidents, i.e., two motor vehicle accidents causing personal injury to Plaintiff’s neck and back. Moreover, both incidents will have overlapping damages, lay witnesses and healthcare providers. Further, both incidents will involve testimony from all parties to each accident as each side will want to know the biomechanical injury causation details of each accident.This action and 22STCV33087 were deemed related and assigned to this Department on November 2, 2023. The motion thus complies with Local Rule 3.3(g).The Court finds that both cases arise from similar incidents, vehicle collisions, and involve the same causes of action for negligence and negligence per se. Further, Plaintiff is the plaintiff in both cases and alleges injuries to his neck and back in both cases. Thus, all these actions involve common issues of law and fact.            However, procedural deficiencies preclude the Court from granting the motion. Plaintiff has not listed all named parties in each case, the parties who have appeared in the actions, and the names of their respective attorneys of record in the notice of motion to consolidate. Nor has Plaintiff included the captions of all the cases sought to be consolidated. Further, Plaintiff has not filed the notice of motion to consolidate in related case 22STCV33087. Plaintiff has thus not complied with CRC Rule 3.350(a)(1).
