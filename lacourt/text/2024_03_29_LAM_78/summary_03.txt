And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that this matter will have to be continued due to the Plaintiff's failure to comply with court orders. Specifically, the Plaintiff failed to dismiss the Doe Defendants, did not file a unified proposed judgment, and did not file proof of service as required by the court. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff requested entry of default using separate forms for each defendant, but must file one CIV-100 as to all defaulted defendants. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff has not submitted proof of service of the Plaintiff's Brief Re: Prove-Up Hearing and the Exhibit List with respect to the three individual defendants. As a result, the Judge will not grant the Plaintiff's request for default judgment at this time.
