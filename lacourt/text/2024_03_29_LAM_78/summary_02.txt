And here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel plaintiff Yoan Koh's responses to requests for production filed by defendants Pacific Union International, Inc., Daniel Kim, and Compass California, Inc. The motion is granted, and plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses without objections within 15 days and produce all responsive documents within 15 days. The court finds that plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests, which waives all objections, including privilege and work product. The court notes that plaintiff's failure to respond is tantamount to no response at all and is subject to a motion to compel responses. Sanctions are not sought in this case.
