And here is the English summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting plaintiff Rosa Maria Mendez's motion to vacate the court's order waiving her right to a jury trial. The waiver was granted because the plaintiff failed to post the required jury fee prior to the Case Management Conference, as required by statute. However, the Judge has discretion to allow a jury trial despite the waiver, and the court's electronic file shows that the plaintiff posted the jury fee on September 11, 2023. Since no opposition has been filed, the motion is granted. The Judge notes that the right to a jury trial is fundamental and doubts are resolved in favor of allowing a jury trial.
