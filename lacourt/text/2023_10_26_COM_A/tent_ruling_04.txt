[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING
MOTION
 TO VACATE COURT’S ORDER OF WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY
 
      Plaintiff
failed to post jury fees prior to the Case Management Conference as required by
statute, resulting in a waiver of jury trial. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 631; Min. Ord. August 28,
 2023.) Plaintiff seeks relief from the waiver.
      A party
waives jury trial by failing to timely pay the jury fee. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 631 (f) (5).) 
The court has discretion to allow a jury
trial although there may have been a waiver. (Code Civ. Proc., § 631 (g).) Relief from waiver may be granted where there
has been no prejudice to the other party or to the court from an inadvertent
waiver. (Wharton v. Superior Court (1991)
231 Cal.App.3d 100, 104.)
Because the right to jury trial is fundamental, doubts are resolved in favor of
allowing a jury trial. (Tesoro del Valle Master Homeowners
Assn. v. Griffin (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 619, 638.)
      The
Court’s electronic file reflects that Plaintiff posted jury fees on September
11, 2023. No opposition has been filed. Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.
