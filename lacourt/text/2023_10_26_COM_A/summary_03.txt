And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted the Plaintiffs' motion to compel the Defendant's compliance with the Court's discovery order, dated May 16, 2023. The motion was filed due to the Defendant's failure to provide complete and relevant documents in response to the Plaintiffs' requests. The Judge finds that the Defendant's supplemental responses are incomplete and do not comply with the Court's order. The Judge orders the Defendant to immediately comply with the Court's order by producing responsive documents within 10 days and imposes prospective sanctions of $500 for each day the Defendant fails to produce the requested documents. The Judge also notes that the Defendant's actions do not reflect a good faith compliance with the Court's order.
