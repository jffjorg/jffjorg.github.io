And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to substitute successors in interest for the deceased plaintiff, Georgia McGreggor. The complaint alleges that the parties jointly own real property as tenants-in-common, with the defendant, Lorna McGreggor, living on the property. The plaintiffs, Wanda McGreggor-Allen and Joseph Cleotha Young, seek to partition the property by sale and account for the property. Georgia McGreggor passed away on August 10, 2023, and her claims survive her death. The court has allowed the motion, which was supported by an affidavit providing a copy of the death certificate and stating that no proceeding is pending in California for administration of the decedent's estate. The court has granted the motion and ordered the complaint to be amended to reflect Wanda's additional capacity as Trustee of the Bernard Trust and Young's substitution as successor-in-interest of Georgia McGreggor and Trustee of the Georgia Trust.
