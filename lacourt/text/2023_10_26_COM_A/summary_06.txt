And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled to sustain the demurrer filed by the County of Los Angeles to the plaintiff's first amended complaint, without leave to amend. The plaintiff, Michael Brian Smith, alleged eight causes of action, including civil rights violations, tort claims, and punitive damages, arising from a traffic stop on March 26, 2020. The defendant argued that the claims are barred by the plaintiff's failure to comply with the Government Claims Act, the lack of alleged facts sufficient to state a claim, and the statute of limitations. The judge found that the plaintiff's claims for punitive damages and money damages are barred by the Government Claims Act, and that the claims for civil rights violations are time-barred. The judge also found that the plaintiff failed to allege facts sufficient to state a claim for the remaining causes of action. Therefore, the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.
