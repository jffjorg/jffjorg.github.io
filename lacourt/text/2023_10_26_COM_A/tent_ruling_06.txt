[TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING
DEMURRER
 TO PLAINTIFF’S FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND
 
I.       
BACKGROUND
       Plaintiff
commenced this action on February 21, 2023. The first amended complaint (“FAC”)
alleges that Defendant violated Plaintiff’s civil rights during a traffic stop
that occurred on March 26, 2020.  Plaintiff
alleges eight causes of action for separate civil rights violations, tort
claims, and for punitive damages.
       Defendant
demurs to the entire pleading on various grounds. The claims for money damages
are barred by Plaintiff’s failure to allege compliance with the Government
Claims Act (“GAC”), the civil rights claims fail to allege facts sufficient to
state a claim, the FAC is uncertain, and the claims are barred by the statute
of limitations. Leave to amend should be denied as any attempt to amend would
be futile. Despite Defendant’s attempt to meet and confer with Plaintiff prior
to filing this demurrer, Plaintiff did not respond. 
       Defendant
served Plaintiff with the demurrer on September 11, 2023. Plaintiff did not
file an opposition. 
II.     
LEGAL STANDARDS
       A demurrer tests the sufficiency of the pleading as
a matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v. Foundation Health
(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.) In testing its sufficiency, the court must
assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual allegations; (2) facts
that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly pleaded; and (3)
judicially noticed matters. (Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The Court may not consider contentions, deductions,
or conclusions of fact or law. (Moore v. Conliffe
(1994) 7 Cal.4th 634, 638.) The Plaintiff must show that the pleading alleges
facts sufficient to establish every element of each cause of action. (Rakestraw v. California Physicians Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) Where the pleading fails
to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, courts should
sustain the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(e); Zelig v. County of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.4th 1112, 1126.) 
III.   
DISCUSSION

A.     
Causes of action for (5)
willful and wanton conduct, (7) malicious prosecution, and (8) punitive
damages. 
       A party cannot commence an action
for money or damages against a public entity unless it first presents a timely
claim to the public entity. (Gov.
Code, § 945.4.) A “public entity” “includes the state, the Regents of the
University of California, the Trustees of the California State University and
the California State University, a county, city, district, public authority,
public agency, and any other political subdivision or public corporation in the
State.” (Gov.
Code, § 811.2.)
       A plaintiff
must allege facts demonstrating or excusing compliance with the claim
presentation requirement. Otherwise, the complaint is subject to a general
demurrer for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
(State
of California v. Superior Court (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1234, 1243.)    
       The
FAC includes an order issued in the related case: 22CMCV00104 Smith v. County
of Los Angeles. (SAC, Ex. A). That action arose from the same March 26, 2020,
traffic stop. The Hon. George F. Bird sustained Defendant’s demurrer to the First
Amended Complaint in that action without leave to amend for failure to timely present
a late claim application with the Defendant within one year from when the claim
accrued.  (M.O. filed 10/13/22 in
22CMCV00104; 5:12-17.) 
Therefore, it would be futile to permit leave
to amend to allege compliance with the GCA given what Plaintiff alleged in
22CMCV00104. 
       Finally,
the claim for punitive damages fails because such damages are not recoverable
against a government entity. (Gov. Code § 818). Demurrer is SUSTAINED as to the
fifth, seventh, and eight causes of action without leave to amend. 
 
B.      Causes of action
for (1) excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment, (2) false
imprisonment/false arrest in violation of the Fourth Amendment, (3) search and
seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment, (4) invasion of privacy by
intrusion and seclusion in violation of the First and Fourth Amendments, (6) 14th
Amendment violation of due process.
 
       Plaintiff brings these claims for
deprivation of rights under 42
U.S.C. § 1983. Courts apply the forum state’s statute of
limitations for personal injury actions. (Klein
v. City of Beverly Hills (9th Cir. 2017) 865 F.3d 1276, 1278.) California
has a two-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 335.1). Plaintiff’s claim accrued on the
date of incident, which was March 26, 2020. The statue was tolled during the
pandemic from April 6, 2020, until October 1, 2020, a period of six months. (Cal
Rules of Court, Appendix, App. I, Emergency Rule 9.) The
claim would have expired on March 26, 2022. Adding six months to that date would
be September 26, 2022. Plaintiff filed this action on February 21, 2023. 
       Defendant
also argues that these claims fail because Plaintiff did not “allege the
conduct occurred in execution of a government's policy or custom
promulgated either by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly
be said to represent official policy.” (Bach
v. County of Butte (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 554, 569.) 
       The
FAC does allege these policies, customs, and practices, sufficient to withstand
demur, but remain barred by the statute of limitations. (FAC ¶¶6-7, 9-11, 18, 23-24;
30, Exs. B and C.)
 
IV.   
CONCLUSION
       Leave to amend is
ordinarily given if there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be
cured. However, it is the Plaintiff’s burden to demonstrate how the defects can
be cured by demonstrating how he can amend his complaint and how that amendment
will change the legal effect of his pleading. (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now v. Department
of Industrial Relations (1995) 41
Cal.App.4th 298, 302.) 
       As
shown above, Plaintiff’s Section 1983 claims are time barred, and the personal
injuries claims cannot be adequately alleged for failure to comply with tort
claims presentation requirements. Based on the foregoing, demurrer to the First
Amended Complaint is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
