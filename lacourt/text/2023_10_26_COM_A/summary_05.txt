And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the matter of Aurmani Jerrell, a minor, who is seeking to change her name to Aurmani Oliver. The petition was filed by Aurmani's mother, Dominique Oliver, and the court has ordered the petitioner to comply with certain requirements before the hearing can proceed. Specifically, Aurmani must disclose the other parent's name and address, serve the other parent with an Order to Show Cause, and file proof of service with the court. If the other parent cannot be located, Aurmani must file a supplemental declaration explaining her attempts to locate them. Additionally, the court notes that Aurmani failed to comply with the requirements for publication of the Order to Show Cause. As a result, the hearing is continued to December 5, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton Courthouse, and Aurmani is ordered to comply with the foregoing requirements.
