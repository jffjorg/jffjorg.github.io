[TENTATIVE]
ORDER CONTINUING
 THE HEARING ON PETITION FOR CHANGE OF NAME
 
Petitioner, Aurmani
 Jerrell by and through her mother, Dominique Oliver, filed this
Petition to change Petitioner’s name to
 Aurmani Oliver as mother named the child after the wrong person. 
              Since only one
parent consented to the name change, Petitioner is required to disclose the
other parent’s name and address and serve the other parent with the Order to
Show Cause at least 30 days before the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1277(a)(4).)
The OSC shall be personally served on the other parent if that parent resides
in California. (Id.) Service outside California may be accomplished by
mail, return receipt requested. Code Civ. Proc., § 415.40 Petitioner
shall file the proof of service with the court prior to the hearing date.
              Petitioner is
required to make diligent efforts to locate the other parent. If the other
parent cannot be located, Petitioner shall file a supplemental declaration under
penalty of perjury stating what attempts were made to locate the other parent and
why service cannot be reasonably accomplished. The supplemental declaration
shall be filed no less than 10 court days before the continued hearing date. Additionally,
the Court’s electronic file does not reflect that Petitioner complied with the
requirements for publication of the Order to Show Cause. Code Civ. Proc., §
1277. 
              Accordingly,
the Court continues the hearing to December 5, 2023,  at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton
Courthouse. Petitioner is ordered to comply with the foregoing requirements.
