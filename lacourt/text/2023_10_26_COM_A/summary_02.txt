And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrers filed by Clear ReCon Corp. and CeLink to the First Amended Cross-Complaint (FAXC) are sustained with leave to amend. The FAXC alleges that Cross-Defendants failed to secure a loan for Plaintiffs to purchase real property and went forward with the foreclosure sale despite knowing of a pending sale to a third party. The judge finds that the FAXC does not state a factual basis for a duty owed by Cross-Defendants to Plaintiffs and Cross-Complainants, and that the claims for declaratory relief are also not well stated. The judge has also denied CeLink's motion to strike the FAXC, finding that it was filed in good faith and that CeLink has not shown any prejudice resulting from the addition of CeLink as a defendant.
