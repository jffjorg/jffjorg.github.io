The judge's tentative ruling is a response to the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's IIED claim and motion to strike the request for attorney's fees. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant failed to remediate serious habitability issues with the residential premises, which caused her to suffer serious health issues and emotional distress. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's IIED claim is uncertain and fails to allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action. The judge grants the defendant's demurrer to the IIED claim with leave to amend. The judge also grants the defendant's motion to strike the request for attorney's fees with 20 days leave to amend.
