BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from an alleged breach of contract.
 
On October 18, 2023, Plaintiff BMO Bank N.A. (“Plaintiff” or “BMO Bank”) initiated the action against
Defendants Medina Truck & Transport, Inc. (“MT&T”), Salvador Medina
(“Medina”) (collectively, “Defendants”) and Does 1-20. The Complaint alleges:
(1) Breach of Written Agreement (against MT&T); (2) Breach of Continuing
Guaranty (against Medina); (3) Claim and Delivery (against all Defendants); and
(4) Conversion (against all Defendants).
 
On May 30, 2024, the Court
overruled a demurrer with motion to strike, filed by Medina on December 2,
2023. Subsequently, Defendants filed their Answer to the Complaint on June 12,
2024.
 
On the same day, May 30, 2024,
the Court granted Plaintiff’s application for writ of possession against
Medina.
 
On June 17, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One (the “Motion”).
 
No Opposition or Reply papers
have been received by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“If a party to
whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails
to serve a timely response to it, the following rules shall apply: (a) The
party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The
party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with
Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280. (2) The party’s
failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or
excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (a).)
 
A.   
Motion to Compel
Responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One
 
Defendants’ counsel, Michael
Brown (“Brown”), attests that on or about December 20, 2023, Defendant Medina was
served with the first set of Requests for Production of Documents by both mail
and email. (Brown Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. “1.”) This service established that responses were
due on January 24, 2024. On February 6, 2024, Brown’s office sent a meet and
confer letter to Medina’s counsel requesting responses. (Id. ¶ 5.)  However, as of the date of filing of the
Motion, Medina has not served any responses. (Id. ¶ 6.) 
 
Based on the above records,
the Court determines that Defendant Medina failed to serve a timely response,
thereby waiving any objection to the requests, including those based on
privilege or the protection for work product, pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision (a).
 
Nevertheless,
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision (a), “[t]he court,
on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that
both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently
served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210,
2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280. (2) The party’s failure to serve a
timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.”
 
Here,
Defendant Medina did not file an Opposition to the Motion. Nor did he move
separately for relief from the waiver. Additionally, there is no record
indicating any responses have been subsequently served by Medina prior to the
hearing. Consequently, the Court finds that relief under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision(a) is unavailable in this circumstance.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the unopposed
Motion.
 
A.   
Monetary
Sanctions
 
Monetary
sanctions, as outlined under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300
subdivision (c) are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand,
unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
 
Additionally,
California Rules of Court rule 3.1348(A) further provides, “The Court may award
sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to
compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Underlines added.)
 
The Court finds the mandatory sanction
applies in this case. Utilizing the lodestar approach, the Court determines the
total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work
performed in connection with the Motion to be $547.50, calculated based on a
reasonable hourly rate of $325.00 for 1.5 hours reasonably spent, plus a $60.00
filing fee.
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiff’s request for
monetary sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff BMO Bank N.A.’s unopposed Motion to Compel
Defendant Salvador Medina to Respond to Requests for Production of Documents,
Set One, is GRANTED.
 
Defendant Salvador
Medina is ordered
to serve verified responses, without objection, to the Requests for
Production of Documents,
Set One, within 20 days. 
 
Plaintiff BMO Bank N.A.’s Request
for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART. 
 
Defendant Salvador
Medina and his
attorney of record are ordered to jointly and severally pay $547.50 to Plaintiff BMO Bank N.A.’s counsel within 20 days.
