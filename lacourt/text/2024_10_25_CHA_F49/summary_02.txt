And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by Defendant Burns & Partners, Inc. to the Second Amended Complaint and has made the following rulings.

The demurrer to the First Cause of Action for Breach of Contract is overruled. The court finds that the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to state a claim for breach of contract and that the defendant's arguments attempting to strike the complaint are without merit.

The demurrer to the Third Cause of Action for Gross Negligence is sustained without leave to amend. The court finds that the allegations in the complaint do not state a claim for gross negligence and that the defendant's breach of contract does not rise to the level of tort liability.

The motion to strike is denied as moot, as the court has already sustained the demurrer to the Third Cause of Action and struck the related portions of the complaint.

The defendant is ordered to serve and file its answer to the Second Amended Complaint within 30 days.
