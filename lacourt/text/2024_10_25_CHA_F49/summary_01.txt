And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff BMO Bank N.A.'s unopposed Motion to Compel Defendant Salvador Medina to respond to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One. The motion to compel is granted because Defendant Medina failed to serve a timely response, waiving any objection to the requests. The judge finds that relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 is unavailable because Defendant Medina did not file an Opposition to the Motion or serve any subsequent responses.

The judge also grants in part Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against Defendant Medina and his counsel. The court awards $547.50 in attorney's fees and costs incurred in connection with the Motion to Compel, calculated based on a reasonable hourly rate of $325.00 for 1.5 hours reasonably spent. The court orders Defendant Medina to serve verified responses to the Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, within 20 days, and to jointly and severally pay the awarded amount to Plaintiff's counsel within 20 days.
