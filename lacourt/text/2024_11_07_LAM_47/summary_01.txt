And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to require the plaintiff to post an undertaking pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1030. The defendants, Brown Label Inc. and Travis Burk, had argued that they had a reasonable possibility of prevailing on the plaintiff's claims for assault and battery, but failed to address the remaining claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, or negligent hiring, retention, and supervision. The judge found that the defendants had not met their burden of demonstrating a possibility of success in the case, and therefore denied the motion. The decision does not affect the determination of any issues on the merits of the action and may not be given in evidence or referred to in the trial.
