## English Summary

This tentative ruling addresses a motion by Plaintiffs Xavier Richie and Karime Aguilar Richie for attorneys' fees following a jury trial against Defendant Kia America, Inc.  

The Court finds that Plaintiffs were not the "prevailing party" because, despite prevailing on one of five causes of action, they received a significantly smaller judgment ($2,287.25) than the Defendant's pre-trial offer ($35,000), and spent a disproportionate amount on legal fees ($367,295.92). 

As a result, the Court denies Plaintiffs' request for attorneys' fees under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.  It also does not rule on Plaintiffs' request for costs at this time.

English:
The tentative ruling states that Plaintiffs' motion for attorneys' fees is denied. The court does not rule on Plaintiffs' request for costs. The Plaintiffs, Xavier Richie and Karime Aguilar Richie aka Karime Aguilar, brought a lemon law action against Defendant, Kia America, Inc. fka Kia Motors America, Inc. under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. Defendant made a C.C.P. §998 Offer to Plaintiffs for $35,000, which Plaintiffs declined. Plaintiffs were awarded $2,287.25 at trial. Plaintiffs sought attorneys' fees and costs in the amount of $367,295.92, but the court found that they were not the prevailing party and therefore not entitled to attorneys' fees under Song-Beverly. The court also noted that there is no authority supporting the contention that an offer to pay money in exchange for a dismissal without a payment date renders the offer invalid. Plaintiffs' costs are limited to costs before the March 20, 2023, §998 Offer.
