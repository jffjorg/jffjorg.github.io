attorney fees; (2) a 0.5 multiplier enhancement on the attorney fees (or $103,789.75);
and (3) $55,926.67 in costs and expenses for KLG.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 1; Civ. Code
§1794(d).)  Plaintiffs also appear to
request in their reply an additional $2,975.00 for Plaintiffs’ counsel to
review Defendant’s Opposition, draft the Reply, and anticipate attending the

Background
This is a lemon law action
brought under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (“Song-Beverly Act”).  Defendant served Plaintiffs with a C.C.P. §998
Offer to Compromise (“998 Offer”) in this matter on March 20, 2023.  (Decl. of Kirnos ¶¶18-19, Exhs. D-E.)  On May 16, 2023, a jury trial began.  (Decl. of Kirnos ¶21.)  On May 25, 2023, the jury delivered a verdict
for Plaintiffs and against Defendant in the amount of $2,287.25, with Judgment
entered on June 29, 2023.  (Decl. of
Kirnos ¶22, Exh. G.)
On
August 31, 2023, Plaintiffs filed this motion for attorneys’ fees.  Defendant filed its opposition on September
15, 2023.  Plaintiffs filed their reply
on September 21, 2023.
 
Discussion
Civil
Code §1794(d) provides that a buyer who prevails in an action under that
section, “shall be allowed by the court to recover as a part of the judgment a
sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s
fees based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have been
reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and the
prosecution of such action.” 
C.C.P.
§998(c)(1) provides as follows: “If an offer made by a defendant is not
accepted and the plaintiff fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or award, the plaintiff shall not
recover his or her postoffer costs
and shall pay the defendant’s costs from
the time of the offer.”  (C.C.P.
§998(c)(1).)  “In
determining whether the plaintiff obtains a more favorable judgment, the court .
. . shall exclude the post offer costs.” 
(C.C.P. §998(c)(2)(A).)  “If an
offer made by a defendant is not accepted and the plaintiff fails to obtain a
more favorable judgment or award, the costs under this section, from the time
of the offer, shall be deducted from any damages awarded in favor of the
plaintiff.”  (C.C.P. §998(e).)
Here,
Plaintiffs were offered $35,000 to settle this case in the March 20, 2023, §998
Offer, declined the offer, and eventually received only $2,287.25 at trial.
To
trigger §998 cost-shifting, “the offer must be sufficiently specific to permit
the recipient meaningfully to evaluate it and make a reasoned decision whether
to accept it, or reject it and bear the risk he may have to shoulder his
opponent’s litigation costs and expenses. [Citation.] Thus, the offeree must be
able to clearly evaluate the worth of the extended offer.”  (MacQuiddy v.
Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 1036, 1050,
citations omitted.)
Plaintiffs
argue the §998 Offer was impermissibly vague, ambiguous, uncertain and
incomplete, rendering it wholly invalid, because the offer lacked specificity
on the date payment to Plaintiffs would be made and was completely silent on
the issue of payment of statutory attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to the
Song-Beverly Act as well as whether Plaintiffs would be deemed the prevailing
party for purposes of any attorney fee motion.  (Decl. of Kirnos
¶¶18-19, Exhs. D-E.) 
Defendant’s §998 Offer was
valid because it was sufficiently specific and unconditional based on Duff
v. Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC.  In Duff, the plaintiff could either
accept the §998 Offer for a sum certain for vehicle repurchase or allow the
defendant to determine the restitution amount if plaintiff provided
documentation of a greater amount than the sum certain.  (Duff v. Jaguar
Land Rover North America, LLC (2022) 74
Cal.App.5th 491, 500.)  Here, unlike Duff, the §998 Offer
provided Plaintiffs with a single option: Defendant would pay Plaintiffs
$35,000.00, and in exchange, Plaintiffs would dismiss the entire action of all
parties and all causes of action with prejudice.  (Decl. of Kirnos ¶¶18-19, Exhs. D-E.)  At the time the §998 Offer was made,
Plaintiffs were provided with a sufficiently specific and unconditional offer
of $35,000.00, which they chose not to accept.
Further, in Covert v. FCA
USA, LLC, cited in Plaintiffs’ reply, the Court of Appeal stated there is
no authority in support of the contention that an offer to pay money in
exchange for a dismissal without a payment date renders the offer invalid.  (Covert v. FCA USA, LLC
(2022) 73 Cal.App.5th 821, 840, as modified (Jan. 11, 2022), reh’g
denied (Jan. 25, 2022), review denied (Mar. 30, 2022).)
Consequently,
Plaintiffs’ costs are limited to costs before the March 20,
2023, §998 Offer.
Defendant
argues Plaintiffs are not entitled to attorneys’ fees under Song-Beverly
because they were not the prevailing party. 
(Opposition, pg. 2.)
Song-Beverly
does not define the term prevailing party.  (Duff, 74 Cal.App.5th at pg. 541,
citing Civ. Code §1794(d).)  Courts
have split regarding how to define this term when it comes to the award of
attorney fees.  (Id.)  The Duff Court elected to take a more
“pragmatic” approach to assess whether a buyer has prevailed, asking “[t]o what
extent did the buyer achieve her litigation objectives?”  (Id. at pg. 542, citing Wohlgemuth
v. Caterpillar (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 1252, 1264; MacQuiddy, 233
Cal.App.4th at pg. 1047; and Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc.
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 149-151.)
Here,
Plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging five causes of action, and only prevailed
on one of those five causes, earning a total judgment of $2,287.25, despite
already spending $367,295.92 on attorneys’ fees and costs in order to litigate
the case for three and a half years.  Plaintiffs
turned down a prelitigation offer for a purchase, replacement, or $10,000, testifying
at trial that it was not enough.  Plaintiffs also turned down $35,000 plus a hearing
on fees prior to trial. Plaintiffs articulated their litigation objective was
to recover in excess of $10,000, and in fact, in excess of the repurchase or replacement
which was also offered.  Plaintiffs
failed to prevail on their first cause of action for breach of express warranty
and prevailed on their §1793.2(b) claim, despite testifying they had no damages
from that one long repair.
The
Court of Appeal in Duff noted of the trial court’s decision to apply
attorneys’ fees per the mechanical approach to §1794(d)
“would make attorney fees almost automatic in any case where a buyer proved his
claim even if he was not harmed and proved no damages.”  (Id. at 503.) While the reward here was
slightly more than the nominal $1 award in Duff, Plaintiffs still failed
to achieve their litigation objective.
Accordingly,
Plaintiffs were not the prevailing party and are therefore not entitled to
attorneys’ fees under Song-Beverly.
 
Conclusion
Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ motion for attorneys’ fees is denied. 
The
Court does not rule on Plaintiffs’ request for costs.
Moving
Party to give notice.
