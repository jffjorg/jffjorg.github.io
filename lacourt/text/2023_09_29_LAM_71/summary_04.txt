And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to Plaintiff's counsel, Raymond Ghermezian, Esq.'s, failure to provide Code of Civil Procedure compliant discovery responses to Defendant's requests for production. The Judge has ordered Ghermezian to provide compliant responses by October 30, 2023, and has sanctioned him $1,000 for his failure to comply. The Judge has also set a hearing to show cause why Ghermezian should not be sanctioned $2,000 and/or Plaintiff's case dismissed for failing to provide compliant discovery responses. Additionally, the Judge has set a hearing to show cause why the Court should consider any of Plaintiff's discovery responses served after December 1, 2022, verified, and, if not properly verified, why the Court should not sanction Ghermezian $2,000 and/or dismiss Plaintiff's case.
