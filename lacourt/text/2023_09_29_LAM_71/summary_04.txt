## English Summary:

This tentative ruling pertains to a case where Plaintiff Juan Galicia is suing Defendant DS Services of America, Inc.  The judge is concerned that Plaintiff's attorney, Raymond Ghermezian, has repeatedly failed to provide discovery responses that comply with California law. 

Specifically, the judge found issue with the wording of Plaintiff's responses, which stated both that Plaintiff was fully complying with the request for documents and that they were unable to produce all requested documents. This ambiguity prevents Defendant from knowing what documents have been produced and what documents are still outstanding.

As a result of these repeated failures, the judge has sanctioned Ghermezian $1,000 and ordered Plaintiff to provide compliant discovery responses by October 30, 2023.  

The judge has also set hearings to determine:

* Whether Plaintiff's discovery responses since December 2022 were properly verified.
* Whether Plaintiff's counsel should face further sanctions, up to dismissal of the case, for failing to comply with discovery rules.

The judge has advanced the trial date and set a Trial Setting Conference for October 30th to address these issues.
