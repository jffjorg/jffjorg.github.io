DISCUSSION
 
Motion to Enforce Settlement
 
Plaintiff asserts that Defendant Best Performance Tire and
Service, LLC (Best Performance) failed to comply with the terms of the parties’
Settlement. Plaintiff requests the Court to enter judgment against Best
Performance in the amount of $17,595 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 664.6.
 
The Court is authorized to enter judgment pursuant to the
stipulated settlement. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.) In reviewing a motion to
enforce a settlement, the Court determines “whether the parties entered into a
valid and binding settlement.” (Hines v.
Lukes (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182.) “A settlement is enforceable
under section 664.6 only if the parties agreed to all material settlement
terms.  [Citations.]  The court ruling on the motion may consider
the parties’ declarations and other evidence in deciding what terms the parties
agreed to, and the court’s factual findings in this regard are reviewed under
the substantial evidence standard. 
[Citations.]  If the court determines
that the parties entered into an enforceable settlement, it should grant the
motion and enter a formal judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement.”  (Id. at pp. 1182-1183; see also Osumi
v. Sutton (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1355, 1357 [“Strong public policy in favor
of the settlement of civil cases gives the trial court, which approves the
settlement, the power to enforce it”].)
 
Strict compliance with
the statutory requirements is necessary before a court can enforce a settlement
agreement under section 664.6. (Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v.
Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37.) The
party seeking to enforce a settlement “must first establish the agreement at
issue was set forth ‘in a writing signed by the parties’ (§ 664.6) or was made
orally before the court.  [Citation.]” (Harris v. Rudin, Richman
& Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 304 [holding that a letter
confirming the essential terms of a settlement agreement was not a “writing
signed by the parties” sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Section
664.6].) 
 
            Plaintiff’s counsel, Joseph Toubbeh, submitted a declaration
in support of the motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement. The Settlement
Agreement between Plaintiff and Best Performance was entered into orally before
the Court on March 7, 2024. (Toubbeh Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A [Minute Order].) Under
the terms of the Settlement, Defendant Best Performance was obligated to pay
the settlement amount of $17,000.00 in installment payments. (Toubbeh Decl., ¶ 3.) The first
installment payment of $1,500.00 was due payable to Plaintiff on March 18,
2024, and subsequent installments of $1,200.00 are due payable to Plaintiff on
the 15th day of each month thereafter.[1]
(Toubbeh Decl., ¶ 3.)
 
Counsel represents that
although Defendant paid the first payment obligation of $1,500, Defendant has
failed to make any payments thereafter. (Toubbeh Decl., ¶¶ 5-12.) Thus, as of April
15, 2024, Defendant Best Performance has not submitted any payments as required
under the Settlement Agreement.
 
            Defendant Best Performance did not file an opposition to
this motion and does not challenge Plaintiff’s assertions.  
 
            The court finds that the Settlement Agreement is valid
and binding. Defendant does not dispute that it entered into the Settlement
Agreement, any of its terms, or that it has failed to make timely payments.
Therefore, Defendant Best Performance is in breach of the Settlement Agreement.
The motion is granted and the terms of the parties’ settlement will be entered
as a judgment.  
 
            Additionally, Plaintiff requests prejudgment interest at
10% per annum retroactive to the date of the Settlement Agreement, less any
payments made by the Defendant prior to the entry of such judgment. This
request is improper as the date of the Settlement Agreement is not the date of
the breach of the Settlement; Plaintiff is only entitled to interest from the
date of the breach – April 15, 2024. (Civ. Code, § 3289.)
 
Request for Attorneys’ Fees and
Costs
 
Plaintiff also seeks an award of attorney’s fees in the
amount of $1,980 and costs of $115. 
 
With respect to attorney fees, Plaintiff has not provided the jurisdictional basis
for the recovery of attorney fees in this case. Attorney fees are recoverable
in an action when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1033.5, subd. (a)(10).) In this case, judgment was entered according to the
parties' oral contractual agreement, which did not include an attorney fee
provision. Thus, there is no basis for the recovery of attorney fees.
 
However, Plaintiff’s request for
costs in the amount of $115 is granted. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1032, 1033.5.)
 
CONCLUSION
 
            The motion to enforce the Settlement
Agreement pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 664.6 is granted in part
and denied in part. The Court will enter judgment pursuant to terms of the
March 7, 2024 Settlement Agreement in the amount of $15,500 plus costs of $115
and prejudgment interest accruing at 10% from the date of April 15, 2024. The
request for attorney fees is denied.
