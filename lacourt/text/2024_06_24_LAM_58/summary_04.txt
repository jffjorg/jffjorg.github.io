And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to enforce a settlement agreement between the plaintiff, Steven Devote, and the defendant, Best Performance Tire and Service, LLC. The settlement agreement was entered into orally before the court on March 7, 2024, and required the defendant to pay the plaintiff $17,000 in installment payments. The defendant has failed to make any payments since the first installment payment of $1,500, which was due on March 18, 2024. The judge has determined that the settlement agreement is valid and binding, and has entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $15,500, plus costs of $115 and prejudgment interest accruing at 10% from April 15, 2024. The request for attorney fees of $1,980 is denied, as there is no jurisdictional basis for the recovery of attorney fees in this case.
