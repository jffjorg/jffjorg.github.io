And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is based on the information presented before the hearing. The plaintiff, Barrett Daffin, as the substitute trustee under the deed of trust, has agreed to be bound by any non-monetary order or judgment issued by the court. The defendant, Trinity, argues that the one-year statute of limitations under 12 C.F.R. ยง 1026.41 limits the claims that can be asserted to those that occurred on June 8, 2020 and thereafter. However, this argument is inappropriate in a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The judge will consider the facts and laws presented in the case, including the definition of a "charge off" and the concept that a debt that is charged off remains collectable. The judge will also consider the plaintiff's intention to treat the account receivable as a loss or expense and the defendant's argument that the statute of limitations applies to all claims.
