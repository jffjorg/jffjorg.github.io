under the Deed of Trust that is the subject of this action, subsequently agreed
to be bound by any non-monetary order or judgment issued by the court regarding
the Subject Deed of Trust. (See 6/30/21 Declaration of Non-Monetary Status, ¶

[2]           “A ‘charge off’ is an accounting term
that is means to ‘treat (an account receivable) as a loss or expense because
payment is unlikely; to treat as a bad debt.’” (Lehman v. Denmark
Bancsahres, Inc. (E.D. Wisc. Nov. 6, 2017) 2017 WL 5151687, *2 [quoting
Black’s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014)].) “By reporting a debt charged off, a
creditor merely declares that the debt is unlikely to be collected.” (Talaie
v. Wells Fargo Bank (C.D. Cal. Jun. 27, 2013) 2013 WL 3316157, *5.)
However, “a debt that is ‘charged off’ remains collectable.” (Id.)


[3]           Trinity argues that the one-year statute
of limitations under 12 C.F.R. § 1026.41 means Plaintiff can only assert claims
relating to Section 1026.41 that occurred on June 8, 2020 and thereafter –based
on the filing of the Complaint on June 8, 2021. This argument for limiting damages
is inappropriate in a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication.
