            This
arises from an employment dispute. The Complaint alleges causes of action for
numerous Labor Code violations by Plaintiff Lazaro Ventura Gomez (Plaintiff) against
his employers, Defendants Duckmill LLC dba Berkshire House, Berkshire
Restaurant and Rami Haddad. 
            
            The
Complaint was filed on August 17, 2021. On March 16, 2022, Defendants Duckmill
LLC dba Berkshire House, Berkshire Restaurant and Rami Haddad filed a joint
answer. On August 2, 2023, the Court struck the answer of Duckmill, LLC and
Rami Haddad and entered default as to these parties.

Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint against Defendants Duckmill LLC dba
Berkshire House and Rami Haddad. The FAC alleges causes of action for labor
code violations for employee misclassification, failure to pay minimum wages,
wages for all hours worked, and overtime, failure to provide accurate itemized
wage statements, failure to pay wages when employment ends, failure to pay
wages every pay period, failure to provide pay records and personnel file,
violation of labor code section 558, and unfair business practices pursuant to
California Business and Professions Code section 17200.
 
            Default
on the FAC was entered as to Defendants Duckmill LLC dba Berkshire House, and
Rami Haddad on March 26, 2024. 
 
            Plaintiff
now moves for default judgment against Defendants. Does 1-50 have been dismissed.
The request for entry of default judgment is denied. 
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff
seeks default judgment in the amount of $70,951.15, which includes $14,514.96 in
interest, $1,328.49 in costs, and $2,237.70 in attorney fees. 
 
            The
filing of the FAC addressed the Court’s prior concerns that Plaintiff’s request
for default judgment damages exceeded the amount requested in the Complaint, running
afoul of Code of Civil Procedure section 580.
 
            With
respect to the sufficiency of the evidence of damages in this case, Plaintiff submits
an identical declaration to the declaration submitted on the prior default judgment.
(See generally 8/22/23 Gomez Decl.) Plaintiff’s evidence shows that he worked for
Defendants as an hourly, non-exempt cook, dishwasher, food prepper, and cleaner.
(Gomez Decl., ¶ 3.) He states that from December 1, 2019, through March 20,
2021, there were several weeks where he did not receive any compensation for
work provided; specifically, he states he was not paid s $12,440.00 in regular
wages; he also requests an additional $12,440 in liquidated damages for the
unpaid wages. (Gomez Decl., ¶ 4.) He also states that he worked overtime
approximately 14 hours a week and should have been compensated an additional $6,120.00.
(Gomez Decl., ¶ 5.) The total damages for the unpaid minimum wages Labor Code
violations are $30,600. (Gomez Decl., ¶ 5.) In addition to these damages, he
also seeks penalties in the amount of $6,700 pursuant to Labor Code section
204. 
 
With respect to
the remaining Labor Code violations, Plaintiff he states he is entitled to
$3,350 for Defendants’ failure furnish Plaintiff pay stubs that accurately
reflected all information required by Labor Code section 226. (Gomez ¶ 6; Summary
of the Case, 4:25-5:9.) Plaintiff also states that Defendants failed to pay all
his wages when his employment ended pursuant to Labor Code section 201(a) such
that Defendants were liable for an additional $3,420. (Summary of Case:
5:10-23.) Relying on the evidence that Defendants failed to pay all minimum and
overtime wages generally, Plaintiff submits evidence of his daily rate to
substantiate his damages for unpaid wages upon his termination. (Gomez Decl., ¶
7; Summary of the Case, 5:11-23.) 
 
Lastly, Plaintiff
submits evidence that he is entitled to 350 days’ worth of rest breaks ($4,200
at $12 an hour) and meal breaks ($4,200 at $12 an hour), entitling him to a total
of $8,400. (Summary of Case 5:24-6:27.) Again, Plaintiff does not submit
evidence that he was not given rest or meal breaks for 350 days. 
 
Thus, Plaintiff’s
damages amount has not been substantiated in the amount of $8,400.[1]

 
Further, Plaintiff
again seeks prejudgment interest starting to accrue from December 1, 2019, the
date Plaintiff’s employment purportedly began. (Nigoghosian Decl., ¶¶ 2-5.) However, the damages and civil penalties purportedly
incurred were not fully incurred as to all amounts until March 20, 2021, or
more than 30 days after for some of Plaintiff’s claims. Thus, Plaintiff’s
interest calculation of $14,514.96 still appears improper. 
 
The request for
costs in the amount of $1,328.49 has been substantiated. (CIV-100, ¶ 7.) The attorney fees sought are reasonable under Los
Angeles Superior Court Local Rule 3.214 are correctly based on the total
damages sought. (Nigoghosian Decl., ¶¶ 6-7.) 
 
Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment in the
amount of $70,951.15
is denied.
