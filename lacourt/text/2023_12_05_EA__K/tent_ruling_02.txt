A Case
Management Conference is set for December 5, 2023.
Legal Standard
A demurrer may be made on grounds that the
pleading, inter alia, does not state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action and/or is uncertain. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subds. (e) and
(f).)
When considering
demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. In a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via
proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d
902, 905 [citations omitted].) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only
allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis
for the claim against him. (Semole v.
Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) “[A] demurrer does not,
however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in
the pleading, or the construction placed on an instrument pleaded therein, or
facts impossible in law, or allegations contrary to facts of which a court may
take judicial knowledge.” (S. Shore Land
Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732
[citations omitted].) 
Discussion
Miri demurs,
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 430.10, subdivision (e), to the entirety
of TSI’s FACC, on the basis that it fails to state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action. Miri also demurs, pursuant to subdivision (f), to
the third, fourth and sixth causes of action in TSI’s FACC, on the basis of
uncertainty.
Request for
Judicial Notice
The court
rules on Miri’s Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”) as follows:
1.      Granted as to Exhibit 1 (i.e., SAC
filed in Case No. 22PSCV00134); 
2.      Granted as to Exhibit 2 (i.e., FACC
filed in Case No. 21PSCV00336) and DENIED as to Exhibit 3 (i.e., email string
dated between February 4, 2021-April 8, 2021).
Evidentiary
Objection
TSI’s
evidentiary objection to Exhibit 3 in Miri’s RJN is denied as moot.
Merits
First
Cause of Action (i.e., for Cancellation of Registration for Non-Use)
Miri contends that TSI is judicially estopped from alleging
actual abandonment on the basis that it has purportedly alleged use of the
trademark in the cross-complaint and in prior proceedings.
Judicial
estoppel “prohibits a party from taking inconsistent positions in the same or
different judicial proceedings.” (M. Perez Co., Inc. v. Base Camp
Condominiums Assn. No. One (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 456, 463.) The
five requirements for the application of judicial estoppel are: “(1) the same
party has taken two positions; (2) the positions were taken in judicial or
quasi-judicial administrative proceedings; (3) the party was successful in
asserting the first position (i.e., the tribunal adopted the position or
accepted it as true); (4) the two positions are totally inconsistent; and (5)
the first position was not taken as a result of ignorance, fraud, or mistake.”
(The Swahn Group, Inc. v. Segal (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 831, 842).
Miri fails to address the above requirements for the
application of judicial estoppel, focusing only on what she claims are
inconsistent positions TSI has taken in the instant FACC, the SAC in Case No.
22PSCV00134 and the FACC in Case No. 21PSCV00336. Without delving into whether
or not Miri’s argument is correct, the court notes that Miri has not addressed,
at a minimum, the third requirement set forth above. The court, then, overrules
Miri’s demurrer to the first cause of action on the basis of judicial estoppel.
Miri also contends that TSI’s allegations of Miri’s use of
the trademark set forth in the FACC indicate there was no abandonment. A mark
shall be deemed to be ‘abandoned’ if either of the following occurs: (1) When
its use has been discontinued with intent not to resume such use. . . (2) When
any course of conduct of the owner, including acts of omission as well as
commission, causes the mark to become the generic name for the goods or
services on or in connection with which it is used or otherwise to lose its
significance as a mark . . .” (15 U.S.C.A. § 1127).
TSI has alleged, in relevant part, that “Cross-Defendant has
not continuously carried apparel associated with the TEEHEE KIDS Mark and that
it was not until sometime in 2021 that Cross-Defendant purported to carry
apparel associated with the TEEHEE KIDS Mark” (FACC, ¶ 10) and that
“Cross-Defendant abandoned the TEEHEE Kids Mark for apparel because she
discontinued use of that Mark with an intent not to resume selling, offering
for sale, shipping, transporting, advertising, promoting or otherwise using
that MARK in the United States in interstate commerce” (Id., ¶ 11). The foregoing
allegations, however, are made on information and belief. “[W]here factual
allegations are based on information and belief, the plaintiff must allege
information that lead[s] [the plaintiff] to believe that the allegations are
true.” (Brown v. USA Taekwondo (2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 1077, 1106
[internal quotations and citation omitted].) TSI has not alleged any such
information that leads it to believe that the allegations set forth in
Paragraphs 9 and 10 are true. Further, TSI appears to concede that Miri was, in
fact, using the trademark in 2021 (and, as subsequently set forth in the fifth
cause of action, “is currently using the trade names and/or brands ‘Teehee
Socks’ and ‘Teehee Kids’”). (Id., ¶¶ 10 and 39).
Miri’s demurrer to the first cause of action is sustained on
this basis.
Second
Cause of Action (i.e., for Cancellation of Registration for Fraud)
Miri contends that TSI’s second cause of action fails because
TSI has not alleged damages.
“Any person who shall procure registration in the Patent and
Trademark Office of a ‘mark by a false or fraudulent declaration or
representation, oral or in writing, or by any false means, shall be liable in a
civil action by any person injured thereby for any damages sustained in
consequence thereof.” (15 U.S.C.A. § 1120 [emphasis added]). 
TSI has not alleged any damages in its second cause of
action. TSI has only alleged, with respect to its first cause of action (the
allegations of which are incorporated into the second cause of action), that it
is “likely to be damaged . .  .,” which
infers that there are no existing damages (FACC, ¶ 13). Miri’s demurrer to the
second cause of action is sustained on this basis.
Third and
Fourth Causes of Action (i.e., for Declaratory Judgment)
The elements of a cause
of action for declaratory relief are: (1) a person interested under a written
instrument or a contract; or (2) a person who desires a declaration of his or
her rights or duties; (3) with respect to another; or (4) in respect to, in,
over or upon property; and (5) an actual controversy. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1060.)
TSI alleges
that there is an “actual case and controversy” between TSI and Miri “as to
their respective rights and responsibilities with respect to the TEEHEE KIDS
Mark and U.S. Trademark Application No. 87446748.” (FACC, ¶¶ 26 and 31). TSI
has not alleged ultimate facts to show a legal right to the Teehee Kids
trademark. Miri’s demurrer to the third and fourth causes of action is sustained
on this basis.
Fifth
Cause of Action (i.e., for Common Law Unfair Competition)
“The common law tort of unfair competition is generally
thought to be synonymous with the act of ‘passing off’ one's goods as those of
another. The tort developed as an equitable remedy against the wrongful
exploitation of trade names and common law trademarks that were not otherwise
entitled to legal protection.” (Bank of the West v, Superior Court
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1263).
TSI has not
alleged facts showing that it is entitled to use of the trademark. Miri’s demurrer
to the fifth cause of action is sustained.
Sixth
Cause of Action (i.e., for Unfair Business Practices [Business and Professions
Code Section 17200, et seq.])
“To bring a UCL claim, a plaintiff must show either an (1)
unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business act or practice, or (2) unfair,
deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising.” (Lippitt v. Raymond James
Financial Services, Inc. (2003) 340 F.3d 1033, 1043 [internal citations and
quotation omitted].)
TSI’s
allegations are conclusory and factually devoid. Miri’s demurrer to the sixth
cause of action is sustained.
