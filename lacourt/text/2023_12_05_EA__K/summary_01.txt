Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on defendant General Motors LLC's motion to strike and tax certain costs claimed by plaintiffs Eduardo Govea and Elvia Elizarraras. The plaintiffs are seeking to recover costs in the action, including jury fees, filing and motion fees, and costs associated with motions to compel.

The defendant argues that the plaintiffs' memorandum of costs is untimely and should be stricken in its entirety. However, the court disagrees and finds that the memorandum of costs was timely filed. Additionally, the court denies the defendant's request to strike out certain costs, including jury fees and costs associated with motions to compel, finding that these costs were reasonable and necessary.

Finally, the court reduces the amount of jury fees from $167.10 to $150.00. The court concludes that the defendant's motion to strike the memorandum of costs in its entirety and alternative motion to tax costs are denied.
