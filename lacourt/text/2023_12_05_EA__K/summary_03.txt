And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a demurrer filed by the defendant on September 21, 2023, which was originally set for hearing on November 7, 2023. The hearing was later rescheduled to December 5, 2023. Although the defendant filed a notice of continuance for the Case Management Conference, they failed to mention the rescheduling of the demurrer hearing. However, the plaintiff, Miri, received notice of the new hearing date and filed a timely opposition to the demurrer. The Judge notes that it is evident that Miri received appropriate notice of the December 5, 2023 hearing date.
