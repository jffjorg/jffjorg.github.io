Strike Memorandum of Costs is DENIED.

is DENIED. The court reduces the amount of

Background   
Plaintiffs Eduardo Govea and Elvia Elizarraras (“Plaintiffs”) allege as follows:
On or about March 23,
2019, Plaintiffs purchased a 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 1500, VIN No. 1GCUYGEDXKZ123656
(“subject vehicle”). Plaintiffs allege that the subject vehicle suffers from
various defects and that the subject vehicle has not been repaired after a
reasonable number of attempts. 
On September 9, 2020, Plaintiffs
filed a complaint, asserting causes of action against General Motors, LLC (“Defendant”)
and Does 1-50 for:
1.                 
Violation of Subdivision (d) of Civil Code Section
1793.2
2.                 
Violation of Subdivision (b) of Civil Code Section
1793.2
3.                 
Violation of Subdivision (a)(3) of Civil Code Section
1793.2
4.                 
Breach of Express Written Warranty (Civil Code Section
1791.2 Subdivision (a); Section 1794)
5.                 
Breach of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability
(Civil Code Section 1791.1; Section 1794)
On February 21, 2023, a conditional
“Notice of Settlement of Entire Case” was filed.
On October 11, 2023, an
“Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Attorneys’ Fees” was filed.
An Order to Show Cause
Re: Dismissal (Settlement) is set for February 7, 2024.
Legal Standard
In general, the
“prevailing party” is “entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any
action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).) The phrase
“prevailing party” includes “the party with a net monetary recovery, a
defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither
plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against those
plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)
Code of Civil Procedure § 1034,
subdivision (a) states that “[p]rejudgment costs . . . shall be claimed and
contested in accordance with rules adopted by the Judicial Council.” A
prevailing party claiming costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs. (California
Rules of Court (“CRC”) rule 3.1700, subd. (a)(1).) “The memorandum of costs
must be verified by a statement of the party, attorney, or agent that to the
best of his or her knowledge the items of cost are correct and were necessarily
incurred in the case.” (Id.) The
contesting party may dispute any or all of the items in the prevailing party’s
memorandum of costs by a motion to strike or tax costs. (CRC rule 3.1700, subd.
(b).)
“If items on their face appear to be
proper charges, the verified memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence of
their propriety, and the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show
they were not reasonable or necessary. On the other hand, if items are properly
objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party
claiming them as costs. However, whether a cost item was reasonably necessary
is still a question of fact to be decided by the trial court. (Jones v. Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th
1258, 1266 [internal quotations and citations omitted].) “Initial
verification will suffice to establish the reasonable necessity of the costs
claimed. There is no requirement that copies of bills, invoices, statements, or
any other such documents be attached to the memorandum. Only if the costs have
been put in issue via a motion to tax costs must supporting documentation be
submitted.” (Id. at 1267.)
Discussion
Defendant moves
the court for an order, pursuant to California Rules of Court Rule 3.1700,
striking out Plaintiffs’ memorandum of costs in its entirety or, in the
alternative, taxing same as to the following items: (1) filing and motion fees
(i.e., $61.65 of the $672.51 in total requested); (2) the entirety of $167.10
in jury fees; and (3) other fees (i.e., $425.00 of the $478.60 in total
requested).
Motion to Strike
Defendant first asserts that Plaintiffs’ memorandum of costs
is untimely and should be stricken in its entirety. The court disagrees. CRC
rule 3.1700, subdivision (a)(1) provides, in relevant part, that “[a]
prevailing party who claims costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs
within 15 days after the date of service of the notice of entry of judgment or
dismissal by the clerk under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5 or the date
of service of written notice of entry of judgment or dismissal, or within 180
days after entry of judgment, whichever is first . . .”
Defendant’s reliance upon Madrigal v. Hyundai Motor
America (2023) 90 Cal.App.5th 385 (“Madrigal”) in support of its
timeliness argument is unavailing. Madrigal determined that Code of
Civil Procedure § 998’s cost-shifting penalty provisions applied under the
facts of that case when an offer to compromise was rejected and the case ended
in settlement. Madrigal did not determine that the deadline for filing a memorandum
of costs pursuant to CRC rule 3.1700 is “triggered” by the acceptance of
a Section 998 offer. Here, no judgment has ever been entered, nor any
dismissal, for any deadline to take effect per CRC 3.1700.
Additionally, as shown in the accepted Section 998 offer,
the parties agreed that “Plaintiffs will file a Request for Dismissal of the
entire action, with prejudice, within five business days after receiving all
payments from GM due Plaintiffs and their counsel.” (Fennell Decl., ¶ 3, Exh.
1.) No request for dismissal has been filed, to date. Defendant’s untimeliness
argument contradicts the terms of the accepted Section 998 offer.
Defendant’s request to strike out the entirety of
Plaintiffs’ memorandum of costs, then, is denied.
Motion to Tax
Defendant alternatively seeks to strike out $61.65 in costs
related to reservations for a hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion for attorney fees,
on the basis that Plaintiffs had not filed said motion by the time they filed
their memorandum of costs. Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiffs
ultimately filed a motion for attorney fees, which was heard by the court. Motion
fees are expressly recoverable under Code of Civil Procedure § 1033.5,
subdivision (a)(1). Defendant has not met its burden of showing that the motion
“w[as] not reasonable or necessary;” as such, Defendant’s request is denied.
Defendant seeks to strike out $167.10 in costs related to
jury fees on the basis that this case never went to trial because it was
settled. Jury fees are expressly recoverable under Code of Civil Procedure §
1033.5, subdivision (a)(1). Plaintiffs, moreover, were required to pay jury
fees in order to preserve their right to a jury trial pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure § 631, subdivision (b) [i.e., “At least one party demanding a jury on
each side of a civil case shall pay a nonrefundable fee of one hundred fifty
dollars ($150), unless the fee has been paid by another party on the same side
of the case . . .”]. Defendant has not met its burden of showing that the
payment of jury fees here “w[as] not reasonable or necessary;” as such,
Defendant’s request is denied. The court will, however, reduce the amount of jury
fees from $167.10 to $150.00.
Finally, Defendant seeks to strike out $425.00 for costs
associated with Plaintiffs’ motions to compel, on the basis that they were
optional and unnecessary and that the “motions practice was entirely
one-sided.” (Motion, 5:8-10). Defendant has not met its burden of showing that
the motions “were not reasonable or necessary;” as such, Defendant’s request is
denied.
Conclusion
Defendant’s Motion to Strike Memorandum of
Costs is denied. Defendant’s alternative Motion to Tax Costs is denied. The court reduces the
amount of jury fees from $167.10 to $150.00.
