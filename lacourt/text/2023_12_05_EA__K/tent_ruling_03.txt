[1]              The demurrer was filed (and
electronically served) on September 21, 2023 and originally set for hearing on
November 7, 2023. On October 23, 2023, the hearing was rescheduled by moving
party to December 5, 2023; although moving party filed (and electronically
served) a “Notice of Continuance of Case Management Conference” on October 24,
2023, advising therein that the November 7, 2023 Case Management Conference had
been rescheduled to December 5, 2023, said notice did not advise that the
demurrer had likewise been rescheduled to that date. However, Miri filed a
timely opposition to the demurrer and identified December 5, 2023 as the
hearing date; as such, it is evident that Miri received appropriate notice of
the December 5, 2023 hearing date.
