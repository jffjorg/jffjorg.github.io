And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the bifurcation motions of Defendants Helen Kim Law, APC and Helen U, Kim, except for the issue of whether Helen U. Kim is the alter ego of Helen Kim Law, APC, which will be tried separately in a bench trial. The judge has also granted some of the defendants' motions in limine, including the exclusion of evidence related to Helen Kim's pregnancy and the admission of evidence related to the Network Deposition Services lawsuit. The judge has denied other motions in limine, including those related to the purported oral agreement to split costs and the admission of evidence related to Helen Kim's billing practices. The judge has ordered the trial to proceed in three phases: jury trial on liability and damages, jury trial on the amount of a punitive damages award, and bench trial on the alter ego issue.
