 Case Number:  22SMCV02721    Hearing Date:   April 19, 2024    Dept:  57 The Court is granting Defendant City of Santa Monica's Motion ("the City") to Compel Non-Party Orange County Sanitation District ("OCSD") to Produce For Deposition the Person Most Qualified ("PMQ") and to Produce Documents.Each of the eight categories listed in the City's subpoena to OCSD about which the City seeks to depose the PMQ are sufficiently clear and specific and are reasonably calculated to lead to discoverable evidence bearing on the City's defense to the employment discrimination claims the Plaintiff has asserted against the City in this action. Any burdens imposed on OCSD and its PMQ by the listed categories are not undue.  The City has established good cause for the production of the documents listed in the subpoena's twelve categories.  OCSD must produce to the City all non-privileged, responsive documents that it has not already produced to the City in response to an earlier subpoena. (Per the motion, OCSD already has produced Plaintiff's application for employment at OCSD, pay history, and performance reviews).  The document requests in the twelve categories are sufficiently clear and specific and are reasonably calculated to lead to discoverable evidence bearing on the City's defense to the Plaintiff's claims.  Any burden imposed on OCSD are not undue.  And any third party privacy interests that may be implicated by the document requests are outweighed by the City's interest in obtaining the information that it is seeking.
