And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case, granting the City of Santa Monica's motion to compel Orange County Sanitation District (OCSD) to produce documents and a person most qualified to testify. The City's subpoena is sufficiently clear and specific, and reasonably calculated to lead to discoverable evidence bearing on the City's defense to the Plaintiff's employment discrimination claims. The judge finds that any burdens imposed on OCSD are not undue, and that the City has established good cause for the production of the listed documents. The judge orders OCSD to produce all non-privileged, responsive documents that have not already been produced in response to an earlier subpoena.
