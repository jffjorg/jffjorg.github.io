Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants have filed demurrers to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint and motions to strike portions of the complaint. The court has reviewed the pleadings and finds that the plaintiff's complaint lacks paragraph numbers and page numbers are mislabeled. The court also notes that the plaintiff has declined to identify the specific title of each cause of action.

The court rules as follows:

* The demurrers by Dr. Gerhardt, Cariveau, and Cedars Sinai Kerlan-Jobe Institute are sustained with 30 days leave to amend as to the first, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action, and sustained without leave to amend as to the second and third causes of action.
* The demurrer by Providence Saint John's Health Center is sustained with 30 days leave to amend as to the fifth and sixth causes of action.
* The motions to strike by Dr. Gerhardt, Cariveau, and Cedars Sinai Kerlan-Jobe Institute are denied as moot.
* The motion to strike by Providence Saint John's Health Center is denied as moot.

The court notes that the plaintiff may amend his complaint only as authorized by the court's order and may not amend the complaint to add a new party or cause of action without having obtained permission to do so. The court also notes that the plaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege claims for professional negligence, breach of duty of reasonable care, and failure to provide reasonable skill and standard of care.

The court declines to rule on certain evidentiary objections raised by Providence Saint John's Health Center, as they were not material to the court's ruling.
