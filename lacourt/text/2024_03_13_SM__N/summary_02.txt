The judge has granted the motion to substitute Georgianne Levangie in place of the deceased plaintiff, Christophe Elise. The motion was made on behalf of Georgianne Levangie, who is married to Christophe Elise and is his successor in interest. The judge found that Georgianne Levangie has filed the required declaration, as mandated by Code of Civil Procedure section 377.32, and that no party challenges her right to substitute in the action. The judge makes no findings on Georgianne Levangie's capacity to continue the individual causes of action alleged in the complaint, but will address such issues if necessary at a later juncture.
