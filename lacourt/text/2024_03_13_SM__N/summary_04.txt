The judge has granted the defendants' motions to compel responses from the plaintiff to their Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Demand for Production and Inspection of Documents. The plaintiff failed to respond to these requests despite two extensions granted by the defendants. As a result, the defendants are entitled to receive responses without objections. The judge has also granted the defendants' request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,684.95, payable by the plaintiff and her counsel to the defendants and their counsel. The plaintiff is required to serve code-compliant responses to the requests within 30 days of the entry of this order.
