And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for contempt of court orders against the defendant. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant failed to comply with a court order dated December 6, 2023, and that the defendant harassed the plaintiff and gave the plaintiff's name to others. However, the judge found that the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to support the motion, including a proof of service upon the defendant. The judge also noted that the defendant provided evidence contradicting the plaintiff's accounts. As a result, the judge denied the motion and ordered that the clerk give notice of the ruling.
