Significant Statements:
  - "The doctrine of forum non conveniens is an equitable doctrine invoking the discretionary power of a court to decline to exercise the jurisdiction it has over a transitory cause of action when it believes that the action may be more appropriately and justly tried elsewhere."
  - "The party seeking a dismissal due to an inconvenient forum bears the burden of proof."
  - "The private interest factors are those that make trial and the enforceability of the ensuring judgment expeditious and relatively inexpensive, such as the ease of access to sources of proof, the cost of obtaining attendance of witnesses, and the availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling witnesses."
  - "The public interest facts include avoidance of overburdening local courts with congested calendars, protecting the interest of potential jurors so that they are not called upon to decide cases in which the local community has little concern, and the weighing of competing interests of California and the alternative jurisdiction in the litigation."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Brink's Incorporated's motion to dismiss or stay the action based on forum non conveniens. The judge found that while Utah has an interest in the action, California also has a significant interest, given that the alleged fraud was perpetrated by California residents and the Regal Assets Defendants' activities took place in Los Angeles County. The judge noted that Brink's Incorporated can still participate in the action by submitting to deposition in Utah or remotely, and that California's discovery rules can accommodate out-of-state parties.

The judge has also denied Brink's Incorporated's request for an order dismissing or staying the action, citing the plaintiff's choice of forum and the need to balance the interests of the parties. The judge has continued Plaintiff Stephen Newland's motion to compel further production from Brink's Incorporated to May 13, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
