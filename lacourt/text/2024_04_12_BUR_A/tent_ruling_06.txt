MP:  


Lincoln Training Center
  and Rehabilitation Workshop (Defendant)




RP:  


None



 
NOTICE:
 

The Court is not
requesting oral argument on this matter.  The Court is guided by
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1308(a)(1) whereby notice of intent to appear
is requested.  Unless the Court directs argument in the Tentative Ruling,
no argument is requested and any party seeking argument should notify all other
parties and the court by 4:00 p.m. on the court day before the hearing of the
party’s intention to appear and argue.  The tentative ruling will become
the ruling of the court if no argument is received.   
 
Notice may be given
either by email at BurDeptA@LACourt.org or by telephone at (818) 260-8412.
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
This
motion was continued from February 9, 2024 on the Court’s own motion. As
indicated in the February 9th Minute Order, the Court was inclined to grant Lincoln
Training Center and Rehabilitation Workshop’s (Defendant) motion to dismiss but
found that notice was lacking as to the Labor & Workforce Development
Agency (LWDA). The Court reasoned that even though Plaintiff wished to dismiss
his claims, the nature of the PAGA claims meant that LWDA was technically a
party to the action entitled to notice of the motion. The Court ordered
Defendant to serve notice of the motion to the LWDA prior to the rescheduled
April 12, 2024 hearing. 
 
On April
8, 2024, Defendant filed a “Notice of Request to Dismiss” showing service of
the motion upon LWDA. It appears that service on the LWDA is mandated to be
filed through the LWDA’s online system. Defendant’s notice is accompanied by a
proof of service indicating that notice was electronically filed with the LWDA
on February 12, 2024.  Defendant also
submits proof of service by mailing to the LWDA, also on February 12, 2024. 
 
Having
reviewed the notice provided and having received no opposition from the LWDA,
the Court is satisfied that Defendant has fulfilled the requirements of C.R.C.
Rule 3.770 (a). As such, the motion to dismiss this action with prejudice is
GRANTED. 
 
It
follows that Defendant’s demurrer to the Complaint, scheduled to be heard April
12, 2024, is moot in light of the motion to dismiss being granted.
