Case # 20BBCV00099

 
MP: 
   Catalina Sandoval (Plaintiff)
RP:      None
 
 
NOTICE:
 
The Court is requesting oral argument on this matter on the
limited issue of the responsible party to the settlement agreement.  Whether all defendants are liable jointly and
severally or simply RK Company, Inc.
 
Case History
 
On September 13, 2023
the parties reached a settlement through mediation in which the defendants,
William S. Prevots III and RK Company, Inc. dba Cigar Cartel in which RK
Company, Inc. (“RK”) agreed to pay $45,000 to Plaintiff to settle the
case.   The payment would be made within
60 days of defense counsel receiving a fully executed settlement agreement and
an IRS W-9.  The settlement check was to
be made payable to “The Gilleon Law Firm.” (Corrales Decl. Exh 1, Settlement
Agreement ¶2.1)
 
The settlement
agreement further states that:
 
Each party hereto shall bear all attorney’s fees and costs
arising from the actions of its own counsel in connection with the Action, this
Settlement Agreement and the matters and documents referred to herein, the
filing of a Dismissal of the Complaint, and all related matters.  (Exh 1, Settlement Agreement ¶4).
 
The settlement
agreement also contained an agreement that the Superior Court shall retain
jurisdiction pursuant to CCP §664 et seq., which would include CCP §664.6.
 
Despite having
complied with the prerequisites for payment and multiple attempts to obtain
payment, the settlement remained unpaid. (Corrales Decl. Exh 2)
 
Issue Before the
Court
 
The Plaintiff seeks
an order enforcing the judgment and an order for attorney’s fees pursuant to
Government Code §12940.   Plaintiff
requests an initial order enforcing the settlement agreement and to retain
jurisdiction to file a motion for attorney’s fees.
 
Law and Analysis
 
CCP §664.6(a) states
that, “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in writing signed by the
parties outside the presence of the court […] for settlement of the case[…] the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.  If requested by the parties, the court may
retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.”
 
From the information
provided to the Court, the parties entered into a valid settlement agreement,
the Plaintiff met all conditions precedent to RK’s obligation to perform,
Plaintiff sought to have RK remedy its breach which it failed to do.   The Plaintiff has met its burden to show a
valid and enforceable settlement agreement, and the Court’s continuing jurisdiction.
 
Under what is
commonly known as the American Rule, each party to a contract pays its owne
attorney fees.  Kim v. Euromotors West/The
Auto Gallery (2007) 149 Cal. App. 4th 170.  CC §1021 unless attorney’s fees are
specifically provided by statute, attorney fees are left to agreement between
the parties.  CC §1717(a) applies to
enforcement of settlement agreements, as to other actions on a contract and
permits attorney’s fees to a prevailing party for enforcement.  Notwithstanding the above, CC §1717 does not
bar a fee award where the prevailing party’s right to recover fees arises under
a fee-shifting statute.  In some
instances, an award of attorney’s fees is possible even where the matter is
resolve by a settlement agreement, absent an enforceable agreement to the
contrary.  Kim v. Euromotors West/The
Auto Gallery, supra 149 Cal. App. 4th at 178-179.
 
Conclusion
 
Judgment entered
against RK Company, Inc. in the amount of $45,000.  The request for attorney’s fees shall remain
reserved by the Court subject to CCP §664.6 and Government Code §12940.
