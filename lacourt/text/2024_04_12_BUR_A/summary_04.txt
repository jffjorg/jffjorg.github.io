And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied John Harvard's motion to quash service of summons. Harvard had challenged the court's personal jurisdiction over him, arguing that he was not properly served with the summons and complaint. However, the judge found that the plaintiff had demonstrated substantial compliance with the code requirements for service of process and that notice was received by Harvard. The judge also found that Harvard's counsel had failed to provide any explanation for how Harvard became aware of the action and had failed to provide any evidence that Harvard had not received notice. Therefore, the judge ruled that the motion to quash service of summons was denied.
