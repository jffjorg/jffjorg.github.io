Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motions to compel further responses to discovery requests are denied as moot, as the plaintiffs have since served supplemental responses to the discovery requests. The judge has also awarded sanctions in the amount of $1,445 against the plaintiffs and their counsel, jointly and severally, to be paid within 30 days. The judge did not agree with the defendant's request for $1,787.50 in sanctions, finding the amount excessive. The judge also did not agree with the plaintiffs' argument that sanctions should not issue, finding that the plaintiffs' failure to provide timely responses to discovery requests was unjustified.
