And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the motion to vacate the dismissal of the lawsuit brought by Mercury Insurance Company against Arthur Melkonyan and Gregor Darakchyan. The court finds that the mistake made by the plaintiff's counsel in requesting the dismissal of the entire action was an honest mistake and that the plaintiff intended only to dismiss one defendant. The court has set a case management conference for August 14, 2024, and has ordered the plaintiff to provide notice of the conference.
