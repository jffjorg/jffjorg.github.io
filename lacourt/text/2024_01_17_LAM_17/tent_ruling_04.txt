Now,
Plaintiff moves to compel further responses from Defendant Paul Aoun to
discovery. 
 
The Court
requires that parties participate in an informal discovery conference (IDC)
before motions to compel further are heard on the merits. 
 
Defendant’s
opposition also indicates that Plaintiff did not engage in good faith meet and
confer before filing these motions. 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff is to contact Department 17 to schedule an IDC. Given
that Defendant already extended proposals to resolve at least some of the
disputed issues here, the Court urges the parties to attempt informal resolution
of this dispute.  Depending on the Court’s
schedule, it may be able to hear the IDC following the morning calendar call.
 
 
It is so ordered.
