And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to waive the appeal bond. The defendant claimed to be indigent and unable to pay the bond, but the court found that this claim was not supported by evidence. The defendant has failed to produce financial documents to support his claimed financial situation and has made contradictory claims about his financial situation. Additionally, the defendant receives $24,978 in monthly rent from investment properties, which suggests that he is not indigent. Therefore, the court has denied the defendant's motion and the appeal bond will not be waived.
