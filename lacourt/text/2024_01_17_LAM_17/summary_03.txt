```

And here is a summary in English text:

In this tentative ruling, Judge Jon R. Takasugi denies the defendant's motion for a judgment on the pleadings. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's claims are legally impermissible because they violate the California Constitution. The plaintiff alleged negligence and negligent hiring, retention, and supervision against the defendant. The court disagreed with the defendant's argument, citing previous cases that held that legislation reviving the statute of limitations on civil law claims does not violate constitutional principles. The court also noted that there is no difference between a claim previously barred by the statute of limitations and one barred for failure to timely comply with the claims presentation requirement. The defendant's motion was denied, and the case will proceed to trial.
