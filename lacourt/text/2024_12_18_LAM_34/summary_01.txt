And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendants' Motion to Stay Pending Appeal, which sought to stay the trial court proceedings pending appeal of the denial of their Motion to Compel Arbitration. The Defendants argued that a stay was mandatory and automatic under the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Coinbase, Inc. v. Bielski (2023) 599 U.S. 736. However, the Judge found that the FAA only applies to federal litigation and does not mandate a stay in state court proceedings. Additionally, the Judge noted that the recent amendment to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1294(a) eliminates the presumption of an automatic stay in cases like this one, where a petition to compel arbitration has been denied. The Judge concluded that the court is disinclined to stay the instant matter and denied the Defendants' motion.
