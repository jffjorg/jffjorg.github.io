And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's applications for a right to attach order and issuance of writs of attachment against the defendants. The amount secured by the attachment is $1,405,288.50, which includes $1000 in costs and $15,942.89 in attorney's fees. The attachment is based on the loan agreement, note, and guaranties between the plaintiff and the defendants.

The court has found that the plaintiff has established the probable validity of its breach of contract claim against the defendants. The defendants have defaulted on their loan obligations, and the plaintiff has accelerated the unpaid balance. The court has also found that the attachment is not sought for a purpose other than recovery on the claim, and that the amount to be secured by the attachment is greater than zero.

The court has ordered the plaintiff to post an undertaking in the amount of $10,000.00 as to each defendant and to submit a proposed right to attach order and order for issuance of writ of attachment after hearing. The plaintiff is also ordered to give notice of the ruling.
