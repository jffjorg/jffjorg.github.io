I.          BACKGROUND
 
            This is a breach of habitability action filed by the tenants
of 920 S. Hobart Boulevard in Los Angeles, California, against Defendants, L.A.
Portfolio Management I, LLC and Hobart Portfolio.
 
            On June 26,
2023, Gavin McCarroll, a plaintiff in this action, passed away.
 
            On October
11, 2023, Petitioner, Sarah Reese, Mr. McCarroll’s only surviving child, filed
this motion for an order substituting herself as Mr. McCarroll’s Successor-in-Interest.  
 
            The motion
is unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
 
            “A
pending action or proceeding does not abate by the death of a party if the
cause of action survives.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.21.)  “On motion
after the death of a person who commenced an action or proceeding, the court
shall allow a pending action or proceeding that does not abate to be continued
by the decedent’s personal representative or, if none, by the decedent’s
successor in interest.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.31.)  
 
            The
person who seeks to commence an action or proceeding or to continue a pending
action or proceeding as the decedent’s successor in interest shall execute and
file an affidavit or a declaration under penalty of perjury under the laws of
this state stating: (1) The decedent’s name, (2) The date and place of the
decedent’s death, (3) “No proceeding is now pending in California for
administration of the decedent’s estate,” (4) If the decedent’s estate was
administered, a copy of the final order showing the distribution of the
decedent’s cause of action to the successor in interest, (5) Either of the
following, as appropriate, with facts in support thereof, (6) “No other person
has a superior right to commence the action or proceeding or to be substituted
for the decedent in the pending action or proceeding,” and (7) the statements
are true, under penalty of perjury.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
377.32.)  
 
            A
certified copy of the decedent’s death certificate shall be attached to the
affidavit or declaration.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.32, subd. (c).) 
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            Upon review of the papers, the Court finds
the Declaration of Sarah Reese complies with the requirements of Code of Civil
Procedure section 377.32.  Accordingly, Petitioner makes a sufficient
showing that she is Mr. McCarroll’s successor-in-interest.
             
IV. 
     CONCLUSION 
 
The unopposed motion is GRANTED.  Sarah Reese is substituted as Plaintiff Gavin
McCarroll’s Successor-in-Interest.
