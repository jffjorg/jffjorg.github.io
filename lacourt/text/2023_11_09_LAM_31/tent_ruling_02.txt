I.          BACKGROUND
 
            This case concerns an attorney-client fee dispute.  Respondent, Entoro Capital, LLC failed to pay
legal fees and costs to Petitioner, Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton,
LLP.  Respondent was served with notice
of its right to fee arbitration, but Respondent did not elect to participate in
fee arbitration.  As a result, on January
24, 2022, Petitioner, filed a Demand for Arbitration with JAMS. 
 
            On April 12,
2023, the JAMS arbitrator entered a final award against Respondent in the
amount of $269,423.90.  On the same day, the arbitrator served a
signed copy of the final arbitration award on Respondent.  
 
            On July 18,
2023, Petitioner filed this Petition to Confirm the Contractual Arbitration Award.  Petitioner
requests that the Court confirm the award of $269,423.90 plus interest and
costs of suit.
 
            The
Petition is unopposed.
