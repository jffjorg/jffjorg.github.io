BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiffs bring this action under the Song-Beverly Consumer

around 9/10/19, for which Defendant issued the manufacturer’s express warranty.
(Compl. ¶¶ 4, 6.)
 
On 5/4/21, Plaintiffs filed their complaint, alleging
against Defendant the following causes of action: (1) Violation of Civil Code
section 1793.2, subdivision (d); (2) Violation of Civil Code section 1793.2,
subdivision (b); (3) Violation of Civil Code section 1793.2, subdivision
(a)(3); (4) Breach of Express Written Warranty; and (5) Breach of the Implied
Warranty of Merchantability. On 6/4/21, Defendant filed its answer.
 
On 8/24/22, Defendant sent Plaintiffs a settlement offer
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 998, “proposing to settle
this entire lawsuit by paying Plaintiffs’ $65,675.00, plus $10,000.00 for
attorney fees and costs (or fees by Motion). Plaintiffs signed the 998 Offer on
September 27, 2022.” (Decl. of Cameron Major ¶ 5.) On
4/28/23, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Conditional Settlement of the entire case. 
 
On 10/5/23, Plaintiffs filed and served their Memorandum of Costs.
On 10/12/23, Defendant filed the instant motion. On 1/29/24,
Plaintiffs filed their opposition. On 2/2/24, Defendant filed its reply.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to
recover costs of suit in any action or proceeding. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1032,
subd. (b).) Costs recoverable under Section 1032 are restricted to those that
are both reasonable in amount and reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5, subd. (c)(2)–(3).)
 
A.   
Timeliness
 
“A prevailing party who claims costs must serve and file a
memorandum of costs within 15 days after the date of service of the notice of
entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk under Code of Civil Procedure section
664.5 or the date of service of written notice of entry of judgment or
dismissal, or within 180 days after entry of judgment, whichever is first.”
(Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1700(a)(1).)
 
Here, as a preliminary matter, Defendant argues that the
Court should strike Plaintiff’s memorandum of costs because it was untimely
filed pursuant to rule 3.1700 of the California Rules of Court. Defendant
contends that the time limit under rule 3.1700 began to run on 9/27/22, when
Plaintiffs agreed to accept Defendant’s settlement offer. (Def.’s Reply 4:1–2.)
 
However, as Plaintiff observes in opposition, “here,
there has been no dismissal [or judgment]. The parties bargained for and agreed
that this matter shall not be dismissed until after all payments due Plaintiffs
and their counsel are received.” (Pl.’s Opp., citing Ex. 2 to Decl. of Diana
Rivero, ¶ 10: “Plaintiffs will file a Request for Dismissal of the entire
action, with prejudice, within five business days after receiving all payments
from GM due Plaintiffs and their counsel.”) Here, it appears to the Court that
the parties agreed for Plaintiffs to dismiss the action after all payments have
been rendered, which include Plaintiffs’ reasonably incurred attorney fees,
expenses, and costs, without limitation as to the time period for which
Plaintiffs were to file a motion for such costs and fees. (Ex. 2 to Rivero
Decl., ¶ 3 “at Plaintiffs’ election, Plaintiffs’ attorney’s fees, expenses and
costs that have been reasonably incurred pursuant to California Civil Code §
1794(d) may be determined by the Court via noticed motion. For purposes of any
such motion, GM will agree that Plaintiffs are the prevailing party.”)
 
Based on
the foregoing, the Court finds that rule 3.1700 of
the California Rules of Court is inapposite to the instant case, where there
has been no judgment nor dismissal entered. While Defendant cites to Madrigal
v. Hyundai Motor America (2023) 90 Cal.App.5th 385, where the Court found
that the structure and terms of the settlement agreement between the parties
supported a finding that the case ended with a judgment within the meaning of Section
998, this Court finds that the Madrigal court’s analysis is inapplicable
to the instant case. (90 Cal.App.5th at 402.) In Madrigal, the parties
entered into a Section 998 settlement of the plaintiffs’ Song-Beverly claims
against Defendant, including that the “plaintiffs could seek ‘fees by
motion,’ to ‘be filed within six months’ of the date of settlement.” (Id. at
391–392.) The issue presented in Madrigal was “whether section 998’s
cost-shifting penalty provisions apply when an offer to compromise is rejected
and the case ends in settlement,” and therefore whether the plaintiffs could
recover for costs or fees incurred after the date of the rejected Section 998
offer. (Id. at 390.)
 
Here, as
Plaintiffs note, “neither of these cases interpret the meaning of the word ‘judgment’
for purposes of Rule 3.1702.” (Pl.’s Opp. 1:17–18.) Moreover, this Court
declines to modify or add any provision to the settlement agreement entered
into between the parties, where the subject agreement otherwise fails to
provide for any time limit within which Plaintiffs, as the prevailing party,
shall file its motion for attorney fees and accompanying memorandum of costs. (Ex.
2 to Rivero Decl., ¶ 3.) “The court is powerless to impose on the parties more
restrictive or less restrictive or different terms than those contained in
their settlement agreement.” (Hernandez v. Board of Education (2004) 126
Cal.App.4th 1161, 1176.)
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s
memorandum of costs is not time-barred by rule 3.1700 of the California Rules
of Court.
 
B.    
Reasonableness
and Necessity
 
A cost award may consist only of allowable costs which are
“reasonable in amount” and “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5, subd. (c)(2)–(3).) In a Song-Beverly action, the
prevailing “buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the
judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including
attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have
been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and
prosecution of such action.” (Civ. Code § 1794, subd. (d).)
 
If the charges listed on a submitted memorandum of costs
appear to be proper charges on their face, the verified memorandum of costs is
prima facie evidence of their propriety, and the burden is on the party seeking
to tax costs to show they were not reasonable or necessary. (Ladas v.
California State Auto. Ass'n (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774–776.)
 
Here, Defendant seeks to tax $930.31 from Plaintiff’s
memorandum of costs, relating to Plaintiff’s motions to compel, Plaintiff’s
jury deposit fee, and Plaintiff’s motion for attorney fees.
 
1.     
Motions to
Compel
 
Here, Defendant seeks to strike the expenses incurred by
Plaintiffs relating to their motions to compel, arguing that “these were
optional costs that Counsel elected, where the motions practice was entirely
one-sided.” (Def.’s Mot. 6:6.) Plaintiffs argue in opposition that “Defendant
has failed to offer any valid argument or evidence in support of its contention
that the costs at issue here were neither reasonable nor necessary.” (Pl.’s
Opp. 3:26–28.) Plaintiffs further contend that “to the extent Defendant argues
that Plaintiffs should not recover the costs associated with their Motion to Compel
Defendant’s Compliance with the Court’s Discovery Order, Plaintiffs’ Motion was
denied without prejudice given that the Court ordered Plaintiffs to file a
motion to compel further responses pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310.” (Id.
at 5:18–21.)
 
The Court agrees, and finds that based on the foregoing, Defendant
has failed to meet its burden to show that the above fees were not reasonably
incurred in the prosecution of Plaintiffs’ claims. Therefore, the Court denies
Defendant’s request to tax the costs associated with Plaintiffs’ motions to
compel.
 
2.     
Jury Deposit
Fee
 
Defendant further seeks to strike Plaintiffs’ jury fee
deposit, arguing that “this case never went to trial and GM should
therefore not be billed for the $150 jury deposit.” (Def.’s Mot. 6:8–9.)
Plaintiffs argue in opposition that when a party demands a jury trial, “a jury
fee deposit is required to preserve a party’s right to a jury trial in this
state, regardless of whether the matter goes to trial or doesn’t.” (Pl.’s Opp. 4:9–11,
citing Code Civ. Proc. § 631, subd. (b).) The Court agrees
and finds that Defendant has failed to meet its burden to show that Plaintiffs’
jury fee deposit was not reasonably incurred. Accordingly, the Court denies
Defendant’s request to tax the cost thereof.
 
3.     
Motion for
Attorney Fees
 
Finally, Defendant seeks to strike the filing fee incurred
by Plaintiffs relating to their attorney fee motion, arguing that “at
the time Plaintiffs filed their Memorandum of Costs, Plaintiffs still had not
filed its Motion for Attorney Fees despite reserving a hearing date. Such costs
are not properly billable to Plaintiffs and therefore should not be billed to
GM.” (Def.’s Mot. 6:11–12.) Plaintiffs argue in opposition that “Plaintiffs are
entitled to all costs and expenses reasonably incurred in the commencement and
prosecution of this matter, including attorney fees.” (Pl.’s Opp. 4:18–19,
citing Civ. Code § 1794, subd. (d).) The Court
agrees, and finds that as of 10/30/23, Plaintiffs filed their motion for
attorney fees, and therefore reasonably incurred the filing fee thereof.
Accordingly, the Court denies Defendant’s request to tax the filing fee
Plaintiffs incurred relating to their attorney fee motion.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is denied.
