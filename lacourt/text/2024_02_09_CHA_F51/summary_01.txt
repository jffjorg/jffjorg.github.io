Summary:

The judge issued a tentative ruling in the case of 21CHCV00354, denying the defendant's motion to strike and/or tax $930.31 from the plaintiffs' Memorandum of Costs. The plaintiffs brought an action under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, alleging that the defendant, General Motors LLC, breached the express warranty on a vehicle purchased on or around September 10, 2019. The defendant sent a settlement offer, which the plaintiffs accepted, and the case was settled. The plaintiffs then filed a Memorandum of Costs, which the defendant claimed was untimely and sought to strike and/or tax. The judge found that the Memorandum of Costs was not time-barred and that the defendant had failed to meet its burden to show that the costs were not reasonably incurred. The judge also denied the defendant's requests to tax the costs associated with the plaintiffs' motions to compel, jury fee deposit, and motion for attorney fees.
