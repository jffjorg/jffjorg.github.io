## English Summary

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Pat Amaka Levison (Plaintiff) vs. Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook-Meta (Defendants). The judge found the Plaintiff's complaint to be unclear and lacking a clearly stated legal claim.  

The complaint alleges that Plaintiff's Facebook account was hacked and that Facebook failed to restore access despite her requests. However, the complaint does not specify what legal cause of action the Plaintiff is pursuing (e.g., breach of contract, fraud, violation of privacy).

The judge sustained the Defendant's demurrer, essentially dismissing the current complaint. However, the judge recognized that this was the original complaint and granted Plaintiff a chance to amend it within 30 days. The amended complaint must clearly state the legal basis for the Plaintiff's claims and provide specific factual details to support those claims.  The judge strongly encouraged Plaintiff to seek legal counsel to assist in this process.

## Case Summary:

**Case Number:** 22LBCV00518 
**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023 
**Dept:** S27

**Plaintiff:** Pat Amaka Levison
**Defendant:** Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook-Meta (Meta Platforms, Inc.)

**Judge's Tentative Ruling:**

The judge sustains the defendant's demurrer (a legal challenge to the plaintiff's complaint).

**Reasons for Sustaining Demurrer:**

* **Uncertainty:** The complaint is unclear and fails to specify a valid cause of action. While the caption suggests a contract claim, the body lacks details about any contract between the parties.
* **Failure to State a Cause of Action:** The plaintiff doesn't allege sufficient facts to support a claim for fraud or violation of protection, as required by California law. 
* **Lack of Specific Detail:** The complaint lacks the necessary detail to support a claim for fraud, needing to specify the misrepresentation, knowledge of falsity, intent to defraud, reliance, and damages.

**Communications Decency Act:**

The judge doesn't rule on whether this Act bars the plaintiff's claims yet, as the facts and legal basis for the claims are unclear.

**Next Steps:**

The plaintiff is given **thirty days** to file an amended complaint that:

* Clearly states a valid cause of action recognized under California law.
* Provides specific details to support all elements of the alleged cause of action.

**Other Notes:**

* The defendant attempted to meet and confer with the plaintiff before filing the demurrer, but the plaintiff did not respond.
* The court granted the defendant's request for judicial notice of Facebook's Terms of Service during the relevant time period.


## English Summary:

The judge has decided to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit against Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook because the plaintiff's complaint is unclear and does not properly state a legal claim. 

The plaintiff alleges that her Facebook account was hacked and that Facebook hasn't helped her regain access. However, the complaint doesn't clearly explain what legal basis she has for her claim. It doesn't specify if she's suing for breach of contract, fraud, or violation of some other law. 

The judge has given the plaintiff a chance to rewrite her complaint and make it clearer. If she fails to do so within 30 days, the lawsuit will be dismissed.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in Markdown format:

**Case Number**: 22LBCV00518
**Hearing Date**: September 26, 2023
**Dept**: S27

**Background**: Plaintiff Pat Amaka Levison filed a complaint against Defendants Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook-Meta on September 28, 2022. The complaint alleges that someone, either from Facebook or a third party, hacked Plaintiff's account and despite Plaintiff's requests, Facebook has not restored access to the account.

**Facts**:

* Plaintiff filed a proof of service of unspecified documents on Zuckerberg on February 16, 2023.
* Plaintiff filed a proof of service of the summons, complaint, and related documents on Facebook-Meta by serving its registered agent for service of process on April 3, 2023.
* Meta Platforms, Inc. filed a demurrer on April 26, 2023.
* Plaintiff filed an opposition to the demurrer on July 14, 2023.

**Demurrer**: The court will rule on the demurrer on its merits, as Defendant satisfied its obligation to engage in the interactive process prior to filing the pleading challenge.

**Grounds for Demurrer**:

* **Uncertainty**: The complaint is uncertain and fails to state a cause of action.
* **Failure to State a Cause of Action**: The complaint does not plead a viable cause of action that exists under California law. Specifically, the complaint does not plead a claim for fraud, breach of contract, or violation of protection.
* **Communications Decency Act**: The court is not ruling on the issue of whether or not the Communications Decency Act bars Plaintiff's claims at this time.

**Conclusion**: Defendant's demurrer is sustained. Plaintiff has not articulated how she would amend if given leave to do so. However, because this is the original complaint, the court is inclined to give Plaintiff an opportunity to attempt to cure the defects in her complaint.

**Order**:

* Plaintiff must file and serve an amended complaint, in compliance with the above, within thirty days.
* Defendant must file a responsive pleading within the statutory time thereafter.
* Defendant is ordered to give notice.

**Case Summary: 22LBCV00518, Hearing Date: September 26, 2023, Dept: S27**

* Parties: Plaintiff Pat Amaka Levison, Defendants Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook-Meta
* Background: Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants on 9/28/22, alleging that someone hacked her account and Facebook failed to restore access. Defendants filed a demurrer on 4/26/23, challenging the legal sufficiency of the complaint.
* Legal Standard on Demurrer: A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of other pleadings, not the truthfulness of the complaint. It can be used to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.
* Meet and Confer: Defense Counsel made multiple attempts to meet and confer, but Plaintiff did not respond. The Court will rule on the demurrer on its merits, as Defendant satisfied its obligation to engage in the interactive process prior to filing the pleading challenge.
* Request for Judicial Notice: Defendant seeks judicial notice of the Terms of Service that governed users’ relationship with Facebook during the relevant time period. The RJN is unopposed and granted.
* Grounds for Demurrer: Defendant contends the complaint is uncertain, fails to state a cause of action, and is barred in its entirety by the Communications Decency Act.
* Court Findings: The complaint is uncertain and fails to allege any cause of action. Plaintiff must allege a viable cause of action that exists under California law. The Court encourages Plaintiff to consult with a licensed attorney.
* Conclusion: Defendant’s demurrer is sustained. Plaintiff has 30 days to file an amended complaint, ensuring that the pleading makes clear what legally recognized cause of action or causes of action she is pleading and that all elements of any recognized cause of action are pled.
