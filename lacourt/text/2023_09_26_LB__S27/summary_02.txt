## English Summary

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Pat Amaka Levison (Plaintiff) vs. Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook-Meta (Defendants). The judge found the Plaintiff's complaint to be unclear and lacking a clearly stated legal claim.  

The complaint alleges that Plaintiff's Facebook account was hacked and that Facebook failed to restore access despite her requests. However, the complaint does not specify what legal cause of action the Plaintiff is pursuing (e.g., breach of contract, fraud, violation of privacy).

The judge sustained the Defendant's demurrer, essentially dismissing the current complaint. However, the judge recognized that this was the original complaint and granted Plaintiff a chance to amend it within 30 days. The amended complaint must clearly state the legal basis for the Plaintiff's claims and provide specific factual details to support those claims.  The judge strongly encouraged Plaintiff to seek legal counsel to assist in this process.
