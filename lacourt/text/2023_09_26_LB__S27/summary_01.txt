Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants against the plaintiff's second amended complaint. The plaintiff, Ariel Knight, alleges various causes of action against the defendants, including breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, violation of Civil Code §1940.2, and breach of warranty of habitability.

The judge identifies several areas of dispute, including the applicability of the sham pleading doctrine, the sufficiency of the pleadings, and the meaning of certain legal terms. The judge also orders the parties to file declarations and briefs addressing the meet and confer efforts and any unresolved issues.

The judge sets the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike for six weeks from the date of the tentative ruling, and orders the parties to submit on the tentative if they do not appear at the hearing.

## Tentative Ruling Summary: Case 22LBCV00019

**Case Number:** 22LBCV00019
**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023
**Department:** S27

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Ariel Knight
* **Defendants:**
    * Robert Louis Wood
    * Jacqueline Amy Wood
    * The Wood Family Trust
    * Robert Louis Wood and Jacqueline Amy Wood as Trustees
    * Henry Perry

**Summary:**

This case involves a landlord-tenant dispute. Plaintiff Ariel Knight filed a Second Amended Complaint (SAC) against the Wood Defendants and Henry Perry alleging various claims arising from their landlord-tenant relationship. The Wood Defendants filed a demurrer and a motion to strike against the SAC.

**Key Issues:**

* **Sham Pleading Doctrine:**  The Defendant argues the sham pleading doctrine bars the SAC. The parties must meet and confer to determine if this doctrine applies.
* **Cause of Action Clarity:**  The Court notes ambiguities in the SAC regarding the second and third causes of action. 
    * The second cause of action incorrectly cites Civil Code §1941.2 instead of §1940.2.  The parties must clarify the intended claim.
    * The third cause of action appears to be both a claim for retaliation by harassment and a breach of warranty of habitability. Plaintiff must clarify which claim is intended and provide supporting authority.
* **Damages:** The Plaintiff's prayer for exemplary and punitive damages is redundant. The parties must meet and confer on the appropriateness of this prayer.  The prayer for statutory damages is tied to the claim under Civil Code §1942.5 and must be addressed in the meet and confer.

**Court Orders:**

* **Continuance:** The hearing is continued for six weeks to allow the parties to meaningfully meet and confer on the above issues.
* **Meet and Confer:**  The parties must meet and confer forthwith and submit declarations detailing their efforts. 
* **Briefs:** If issues remain unresolved after meet and confer, the parties must submit briefs (not to exceed ten pages) addressing those issues.

**Next Steps:**

The parties must implement the Court's orders and meet and confer to resolve the issues raised in the demurrer and motion to strike.

3. **Third Cause of Action**: The parties should meet and confer to determine whether the sham pleading doctrine applies and to clarify whether the cause of action is for retaliation by harassment or breach of warranty of habitability.
4. **Punitive Damages**: The parties should meet and confer to clarify the prayer for punitive damages and ensure it is adequately pled.
5. **Statutory Damages**: The parties should meet and confer to address both the cause of action and the corresponding prayer for damages in relation to §1942.5.
6. **Conclusion**: The hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike is continued for six weeks to Tuesday, November 7, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. in Department S27. The parties must meet and confer forthwith and submit a brief if any issues remain unresolved.
