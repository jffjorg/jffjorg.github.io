And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to vacate a judgment entered in favor of the plaintiffs, Eda DiPasquale and Scott McChesney, against the defendant, John Cruz. The defendant claims he did not receive notice of the trial date. The judge notes that the defendant's credibility is questionable, as he failed to appear at previous hearings and filed a motion to quash and demurrer that were denied. The judge also notes that the defendant's claims about not receiving notice of the trial date are not supported by evidence. Despite this, the judge is inclined to grant the motion to vacate the judgment due to the strong presumption in favor of trial on the merits. However, the judge is also inclined to proceed with a trial on the merits immediately following the hearing on this motion, so that the parties can resolve the case expeditiously.

* **Arguments in Plaintiff's Favor:**
