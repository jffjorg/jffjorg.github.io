Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion to vacate a judgment in an unlawful detainer action. The plaintiff, Eda DiPasquale and Scott McChesney, filed a complaint against the defendant, John Cruz, seeking possession and damages. The defendant did not appear at the bench trial, and the court entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant then filed a motion to vacate the judgment, claiming that he was not given notice of the trial date. The judge is inclined to grant the motion, but only if the defendant appears prepared for trial at the hearing on this motion. The judge is also inclined to proceed with trial on the merits at the conclusion of the hearing. The decision is based on the credibility of the parties' claims and the strong presumption in favor of trial on the merits.
