And here is the English-text summary:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to continue the trial, which was scheduled for July 15, 2024, to approximately December 18, 2024. The motion was filed on March 15, 2024, and was granted after considering the factors set forth in California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332. The court found that good cause exists to continue the trial due to the defendant's timely filed motion for summary judgment, which is set to be heard on October 28, 2024. The court also considered that the plaintiff did not oppose the motion until April 15, 2024, and that the defendant has a right to have his timely filed summary judgment motion heard before trial. The court's decision is based on the principles of justice and fairness, and is intended to ensure that all parties have a fair and reasonable opportunity to present their cases.
