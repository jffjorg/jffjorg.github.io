English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment on the plaintiff's cross-complaint. The plaintiff was electrocuted while performing work on August 16, 2018, and alleges that the defendant, American Home Shield of California, Inc., is liable for his injuries. The defendant argues that it has no liability to the plaintiff because it is a home warranty company that administers home warranty contracts and does not have any control over the work performed by independent contractors. The Judge finds that the defendant has met its burden of showing that it did not have any duty, and did not breach any duty, to the plaintiff. As a result, the plaintiff's claims for equitable indemnity, contribution, and declaratory relief are dismissed. The defendant's motions for summary judgment or summary adjudication on each of the three causes of action in the cross-complaint are granted.
