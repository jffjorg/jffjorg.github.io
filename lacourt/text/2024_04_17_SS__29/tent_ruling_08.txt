 Case Number:  21STCV46280    Hearing Date:   April 17, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Respond to Requests for
Production (Set Two), filed by Defendants Sportsmen’s Lodge Owner, LLC and
Midwood Management Corp.
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
The request for sanctions is denied.
Background
On December 20, 2021, Plaintiff Jody
Swafford (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants County of Los
Angeles (“County”), City of Los Angeles (“City”), Los Angeles Homeless Services
Authority (“LAHSA”), State of California (“State”), Sportsmen’s Lodge Owner,
LLC (“Owner”), Midwood Management Corp. (”Management”), and Does 1 through 100,
asserting causes of action for negligence, violation of Government Code
sections 815.2(a) and 820(a), and dangerous condition of public property,
arising out of a slip and fall incident on March 15, 2021.
County filed its answer on July
7, 2022.  Owner and Management filed
their answer on September 9, 2022.  
City filed its answer on July 5,
2023.  On the same day, City filed a
cross-complaint against LAHSA, Owner, Management, and Roes 1 through 20. 
On December 8, 2023, the Court granted the motion
of Plaintiff’s counsel to be relieved.
On January 12, 2024, Owner and Management (collectively
“Defendants”) served Plaintiff with discovery, including Requests for
Production (Set Two).  (Carpenter Decl.,
¶ 2 & Exh A.)  Defendants served
Plaintiff by mail (Id., Exh. A.) 
Plaintiff did not respond.  (Id.,
¶ 4.)
On February 21, 2024, Defendants filed this
motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to the Requests for Production.  Defendants also seek sanctions.  The motion was served on Plaintiff by mail.
Plaintiff has not filed any opposition.
Legal Standard
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7
of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.030 provides
that the court may impose sanctions “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter
governing any particular discovery method or any other provision of this
title.”  Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to
include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery.”  Where a party or attorney
has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary
sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd.
(a).)
Discussion
Defendants served Plaintiff with Requests for
Production (Set Two) on January 12, 2024. 
(Carpenter Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh A.) 
Plaintiff has not served a response. 
(Id., ¶ 4.)
Defendants need not show anything more.  Their motion to compel is GRANTED.
Defendants’ request for sanctions is DENIED.  
Defendants seek sanctions under section 2031.300,
subdivision (c), and sections 2023.010, et seq.  Section 2031.300, subdivision (c), authorizes
an award of sanctions against a party or attorney “who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes” a motion to compel initial responses; here, no opposition was
filed.  Sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 “do not independently authorize the trial court to
impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.”  (City of Los Angeles v.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466,
504.)  (The Court is aware that the California Supreme Court has
granted review of the City of Los Angeles case, but the Court notes that the
order granting review, filed on January 25, 2023, states that pending review,
the appellate opinion “may be cited,” including “for its persuasive
value.”  The Court finds the reasoning of Justice Moor in the City
of Los Angeles case to be persuasive.)
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to serve written,
code-compliant, verified responses, without objection, to Defendants’ Requests
for Production (Set Two) within 30 days of notice.
The Court DENIES Defendants’ request for sanctions.
The Court ORDERS
moving parties to give notice.
