And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's demand for a jury trial. The plaintiff had filed a complaint against the defendants for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence causes of action arising from an automobile accident. The plaintiff had failed to post jury fees in a timely manner, but claimed that the delay was due to excusable neglect and inadvertence. The defendants argued that they would be prejudiced by the delay and would have to pay additional costs for a jury trial. The judge found that there was no undue or unfair prejudice and exercised its discretion to deny the motion to strike and relieve the plaintiff from waiver of the right to a jury trial.
