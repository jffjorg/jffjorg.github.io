Legal Standard
 
“Any party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral
deposition of any person, including any party to the action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.)  Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210
through 2025.280 provide the requirements for (among other things) what must be
included in a deposition notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and
how and when the notice must be served.  
“The service of a deposition notice … is effective to require any
deponent who is a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent,
or employee of a party to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection
and copying.”  (Id., § 2025.280,
subd. (a).)
Section 2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a
written objection at least three days before the deposition if the party
contends that a deposition notice does not comply with the provisions of
sections 2025.210 through 2025.280.
“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action
or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization
that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410,
fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce
for¿inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move
for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (a).)  Any such motion to compel must show good
cause for the production of documents and, when a deponent has failed to
appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a declaration stating that the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”  (Id., subd. (b).)  
When a motion to compel is granted, “the court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor
of the party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party
with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450,
subd. (g)(1).) 
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery.”  Where a party or attorney
has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary
sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Id., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On
January 12, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiff with notice of taking deposition
of Plaintiff. (Bauerlein Decl., ¶ 12.) Plaintiff failed to appear at the
January 31, 2024 deposition, and a certificate of non-appearance was taken. (Id.,
¶ 7.) 
 
Plaintiff
has an obligation under the Civil Discovery Act to appear for and testify at a
properly noticed deposition.  Plaintiff
has not done so.  Defendant need not show
anything more.  The motion to compel is
granted.
 
The request for monetary sanctions is also
granted in part.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (g)(1).)  Given the relatively straightforward
nature of this motion, sanctions are set in the amount of $615, calculated
based on three hours of attorney time, multiplied by counsel’s billing rate of
$185 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee. 
(Bauerlein Decl., ¶ 8.)
The
request for terminating sanctions is denied. 
Defendant has not made a showing sufficient to support this request.
 
Conclusion
 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to compel. 
 
The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff to appear for and testify at deposition on May __, 2024,
at 1:30 pm, by Zoom.
 
The
Court GRANTS in part Defendant’s request for sanctions.

Discovery Act in the amount of $615, within 30 days of notice.
