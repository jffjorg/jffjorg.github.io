 Case Number:  21STCV36581    Hearing Date:   April 17, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Quash filed by Specially
Appearing Defendant Steve
Jakubczak.
 
TENTATIVE
The motion to quash service of the summons is
granted.
BACKGROUND
 
On October 4,
2021, Santiago Merlos and Nelson Blanco (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a
complaint against Steve Jakubczak (“Defendant”) and PV Holding Corp. for a
negligence cause of action arising out of an automobile accident occurring on
October 15, 2019.
 
On May 4, 2023, Defendant
filed this motion to quash service of summons. No opposition has been filed.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
C.C.P. §415.10 provides the requirements of
personal service of summons and the complaint as follows: “A summons may be
served by personal delivery of a copy of the summons and of the complaint to
the person to be served. Service of a summons in this manner is deemed complete
at the time of such delivery.  The date
upon which personal delivery is made shall be entered on or affixed to the face
of the copy of the summons at the time of its delivery. However, service of a
summons without such date shall be valid and effective.”
“When a defendant challenges the court’s
personal jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of process ‘the burden
is on the plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter
alia, the facts requisite to an effective service.’”  (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140
Cal.App.4th 403, 413; see also 1 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide:
Civil Procedure Before Trial (2023), ¶ 4:421.5.) 
C.C.P. §418.10(a)(1) provides that, “A
defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any
further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a
notice of motion… To quash service of summons on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction of the court over him or her.” 
If service of summons is not properly and
validly effectuated by one or more of the approved methods, California courts
lack personal jurisdiction over the defendants, and any judicial actions taken
without such service violates principles of fundamental due process and is
therefore void. (County of San Diego v. Gorham (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th
1215, 1231.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant challenges the validity of the
proof of service.  When the validity of
service is challenged, the burden of proof is on plaintiff to show effective
service.  (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140
Cal.App.4th 403, 413.) 
 
Here, however, Plaintiff has not opposed
the motion at all, much less presented facts that show that service was
effective.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff has not
carried his burden, and the motion to quash is granted.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion to quash service of the
summons.
 
The Court requests
that the Judicial Assistant give notice.
