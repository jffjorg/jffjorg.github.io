 Case Number:  21STCV14423    Hearing Date:   April 17, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Continue Trial filed by Defendant James W.
Stewart II.
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
Plaintiff Louise Bellamy (“Plaintiff”) alleges that on November
10, 2020, she fell and was injured on a public path or walkway in Long Beach,
California. On April 16, 2021, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants
City of Long Beach (“City”) and Does 1 to 50 asserting causes of action for negligence
and premises liability. City filed an answer on June 1, 2021.
On December 15, 2021, Plaintiff filed an amendment to the
complaint to name James W. Stewart, II (“Stewart”) as Doe 1. 
On June 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”)
asserting the same claims against the same defendants. On June 6 and 29, 2023,
Stewart and City filed their answers to the FAC.
On March
1, 2024, Stewart filed his motion for summary judgment.  The motion is set for hearing on October 28,
2024, more than three months after the current trial date of July 15, 2024. 
 
On March 15, 2024, Stewart filed this motion to continue
trial. No timely opposition was filed. 
On April 15, Plaintiff filed an untimely opposition.  Stewart filed a reply on April 16.
 
Legal Standard
Code Civ. Proc. § 128(a)(8) provides that the
court has the power to amend and control its process and orders so as to make
them conform to law and justice. “The power to determine when a continuance
should be granted is within the discretion of the trial court.” (Color-Vue,
Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide
latitude in the matter of calendar control including the granting or denying of
continuances.” (Park Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.)  
Each request for a continuance must be
considered on its own merits according to California Rules of Court, Rule
3.1332(c). The court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of
good cause requiring the continuance. Circumstances of good cause include:  
“(1) The unavailability of an essential lay
or expert witness because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(2) The unavailability of a party because of
death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;  
(3) The unavailability of trial counsel
because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;  
(4) The substitution of trial counsel, but
only where there is an affirmative showing that the substitution is required in
the interests of justice;  
(5) The addition of a new party if: (A) The
new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare
for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had a reasonable opportunity to
conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard to the new party's
involvement in the case;  
(6) A party's excused inability to obtain
essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent
efforts; or  
(7) A significant, unanticipated change in
the status of the case as a result of which the case is not ready for
trial.”  
(Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1332(c).)  
 
California Rules
of Court, Rule 3.1332 sets forth a list of non-exhaustive factors to be
analyzed when determining whether good cause for a trial continuance is
present. A court considers factors such as: 

“(1) The proximity of the trial date;  
(2) Whether there was any previous
continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party;  
(3) The length of the continuance
requested;  
(4) The availability of alternative means to
address the problem that gave rise to the motion or application for a
continuance;  
(5) The prejudice that parties or witnesses
will suffer as a result of the continuance; 
(6) If the case is entitled to a preferential
trial setting, the reasons for that status and whether the need for a
continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; 
(7) The court's calendar and the impact of
granting a continuance on other pending trials; 
(8) Whether trial counsel is engaged in
another trial;  
(9) Whether all parties have stipulated to a
continuance;  
(10) Whether the interests of justice are
best served by a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by imposing
conditions on the continuance; and  
(11) Any other fact or circumstance relevant
to the fair determination of the motion or application.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(d).) 
“A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment
motion filed within the time limits of section 437c.” (Sentry Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529; accord Cole v. Superior
Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.)
Discussion
The Court exercises its discretion to consider the late filed opposition
of Plaintiff.
The motion is granted.  Good cause
exists to continue trial as Defendant have filed a motion for summary judgment,
set to be heard October 28, 2024, after the current trial date of July 15, 2024.
(Elder Decl., ¶¶ 6, 8.) Although Plaintiff argues that Stewart could have and should
have filed the motion earlier, the fact remains that the summary judgment
motion was timely filed, and Stewart has a right to have his timely filed
summary judgment motion heard before trial.
Accordingly, the motion to continue trial is GRANTED.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS
Stewart’s motion to continue trial.
The Court
advances and continues the trial date to approximately December 18, 2024.  Final Status Conference and all deadlines are
reset based on the new trial date. 
Moving Party is
ORDERED to give notice.
