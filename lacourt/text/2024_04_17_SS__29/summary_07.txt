```

And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling is that the motion for terminating sanctions filed by Plaintiff Fernando Sanchez is denied. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has not shown repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process, and that a terminating sanction would create an improper windfall for the Plaintiff. The Court has previously denied the Plaintiff's first motion for terminating sanctions due to a defect in service, and this defect has not been remedied. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff has not made a sufficient showing to justify the imposition of terminating sanctions. Finally, the Court orders the Plaintiff to give notice and file proof of service within 5 days of the hearing.
