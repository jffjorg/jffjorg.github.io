```

And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) and motion for new trial. The defendant had argued that the plaintiff's breach of warranty claim was barred by the four-year statute of limitations and that the jury's award of "cover" damages was improper. The judge found that there was substantial evidence to support the jury's findings and that the defendant had not met the standard for granting a new trial. The defendant's motion for JNOV was denied on the grounds that the evidence supported the jury's findings, and the motion for new trial was denied because there was no legal error, excessive damages, or insufficiency of the evidence.
