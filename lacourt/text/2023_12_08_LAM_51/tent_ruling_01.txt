STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
Plaintiff Diana Parros (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint against
Defendant Kia Motors America, Inc. (Defendant) on June 15, 2018. On October 18,
2018, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint. On February 19, 2019,
Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint. On July 1, 2019, Plaintiff filed a
Third Amended Complaint (TAC) with six causes of action for: (1) Violation of
Subdivision (D) of Civil Code Sec. 1793.2; (2) Violation of Subdivision (B) of
Civil Code Sec. 1793.2; (3) Violation of Subdivision (A)(3) of Civil Code Sec.
1793.2; (4) Breach of Express Written Warranty; (5) Breach of the Implied
Warranty of Merchantability; and (6) Fraud by Omission. 
 
According to the TAC, Plaintiff purchased a 2013 Kia Optima
hybrid (the Subject Vehicle) on June 19, 2013 from Defendant’s authorized
dealership in Valencia, California. Plaintiff alleges that the Subject Vehicle
contained or developed various defects during the warranty period that could
not be fixed despite multiple repair attempts.
 
On February 13, 2020, Defendant filed an Answer to the TAC.
 
On October 6, 2021, Plaintiff filed a request for dismissal
of her Sixth Cause of Action for Fraud by Omission.
 
On October 20, 2021, the court heard Defendant’s motion for
summary judgment, or alternatively summary adjudication, where it GRANTED as to
Plaintiff’s Fifth Cause of Action and DENIED as to Plaintiff’s First, Second,
Third, and Fourth Causes of Action.
 
On August 8, 2023, jury trial commenced.
 
On August 10, 2023, the court dismissed Plaintiff’s Second

Judgment or Order. 
 
On October 19, 2023, Defendant timely filed a Notice of
Intent to Move for and Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict and a Notice
of Intent to Move for New Trial.
 
On October 20, 2023, the court filed a Notice of Hearing on
Motion for New Trial for December 8, 2023.

and Authorities in Support of its Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the
Verdict and Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of its Motion for
New Trial.
 
On November 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed an ex parte application for an Order
Extending Plaintiff’s Time to Respond to Defendant’s Motion for New Trial and
Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict, which the court GRANTED. Plaintiff’s
response was now due no later than November 27, 2023 and any reply would be due
no later than December 4, 2023.
 
On November 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed an Opposition to
Defendant’s Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict and Motion for New
Trial.
 
On December 4, 2023, Defendant timely filed reply briefs.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Motion for Judgment
Notwithstanding the Verdict
 
A motion for judgment
notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) shall be made within the period specified by
Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 659, in respect of the filing and serving of notice of
intention to move for a new trial. (CCP § 629.) That is, motions for judgment notwithstanding the
verdict must be written and properly served on the trial court and parties,
within the fifteen (15) days prescribed by CCP
§ 659. (Younesi v. Lane (1991) 228 Cal. App. 3d 967, 975, overruled on different
grounds by Van Beurden Ins. Services,
Inc. v. Customized Worldwide Weather Ins. Agency, Inc. (1997) 15 Cal. 4th 51, 63; see also Sturgeon v. Leavitt (1979) 94 Cal. App. 3d 957, 962 (When
a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is filed after the fifteen
(15) day period denoted in CCP § 659, the motion is ineffectual and the trial judge has no
power to act on it.)) Yet, the court shall not rule upon the motion for
judgment notwithstanding the verdict until the expiration of the time within
which a motion for a new trial must be served and filed, and if a motion for a
new trial has been filed with the court by the aggrieved party, the court shall
rule upon both motions at the same time. (CCP § 629.)¿ 
¿ 
The trial court has limited
discretion to grant a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict; it may
grant it only when there is no substantial evidence to support the verdict. (Teitel v. First Los Angeles Bank (1991)
231 Cal. App. 3d 1593, 1603 (Teitel);
Campbell v. Cal-Gard Surety Services,
Inc. (1998) 62 Cal. App. 4th 563, 570.) A judgment notwithstanding the
verdict can be sustained only when it can be said as a matter of law that no
other reasonable conclusion is legally deducible from the evidence, and that
any other holding would be so lacking in evidentiary support that the reviewing
court would be compelled to reverse it, or the trial court would be compelled
to set it aside as a matter of law. (Moore
v. City and County of San Francisco (1970) 5 Cal. App. 3d 728, 733 – 734.)
The trial court renders judgment notwithstanding the verdict when a motion for
directed verdict should have been granted if made. (Code Civ. Proc. § 629; Hansen v. Sunnyside Products, Inc. (1997)
55 Cal. App. 4th 1497, 1510 [Rev. Den. 9/17/97]; Walton v. Magno (1994) 25 Cal. App .4th 1237, 1239–40.) The trial
judge cannot, therefore, reweigh the evidence, or judge the credibility of
witnesses; if the evidence is conflicting or if several reasonable inferences
may be drawn, the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict should be
denied. (Teitel, supra, at p. 1603.)¿ 
 
Motion for New
Trial
 
A verdict may be vacated and any other decision may be modified or vacated, in
whole or in part, and a new or further trial granted on all or part of the
issues on the application of the party aggrieved, for any of the following
causes, materially affecting the substantial rights of such party:¿ 
¿ 
(1)¿Irregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury¿or
adverse party, or any order of the court or abuse of discretion by which either
party was prevented from having a fair trial;¿ 
 
(2)¿Misconduct of the jury;¿and whenever any one or more of
the jurors have been induced to assent to any general or special verdict, or to
a finding on any question submitted to them by the court, by are sort to the
determination of chance, such misconduct may be proved by the affidavit of any
one of the jurors;¿ 
¿ 
(3) Accident or surprise, which ordinary prudence could not
have guarded against;¿ 
¿ 
(4) Newly discovered evidence, material for the party
making the application, which he could not, with reasonable diligence, have
discovered and produced at the trial;¿ 
¿ 
(5) Excessive or inadequate damages;¿ 
¿ 
(6) Insufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict or
other decision, or the verdict or other decision is against law;¿ 
¿ 
(7) Error in¿law, occurring at the trial and¿excepted to by
the party making the application.¿ 
¿ 
(See CCP § 657.)¿ 
¿ 
When ruling on an application for a new trial, the court
sits as an independent trier of fact.¿(Lane
v. Hughes Aircraft Co. (2000) 22 Cal.4th¿405, 412.)¿The court, therefore,
has broad discretion to order new trials, limited only by the obligation to
state its reasons for granting a new trial and the existence of substantial
evidence in the record to support those reasons.¿(Ibid.)¿¿In assessing¿the need for a new trial,¿the court must rely
on its¿view of the overall record,¿taking
into account such factors, among others, as
the nature and seriousness of the¿alleged¿misconduct, the general¿atmosphere,
including the judge’s control, of the trial, the likelihood of prejudicing the
jury, and the efficacy of objection or admonition under all the circumstances.¿(Dominguez v. Pantalone¿(1989) 212
Cal.App.3d¿201, 211.)¿ 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
JNOV
 
Defendant advances two main arguments supporting their
request for JNOV: (1) Plaintiff’s express warranty claim is barred by the
four-year statute of limitations, or (2) to strike the jury’s improper award of
“cover” damages and to reduce the civil penalty to the maximum permitted by
law. 
 
“A motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict may be
granted only if it appears from the evidence, viewed in the light most
favorable to the party securing the verdict, that there is no substantial
evidence in support. [citation omitted.] If there is any substantial evidence,
contradicted or uncontradicted, to support the verdict, we affirm the verdict.
[citation omitted.] Substantial evidence is that of a “ponderable legal
significance, reasonable, credible, and of solid value…We resolve all evidentiary
conflicts and indulge all reasonable inferences in support of the judgment.” (Burch v. CertainTeed Corporation (2019)
34 Cal.App.5th 341, 348.)  
 
Statute of
Limitations
 
Defendant contends that the evidence shows that Plaintiff
had reason to suspect she had been wronged and to investigate the factual basis
for her breach of warranty claim by at least February 2014. Plaintiff argues
there is substantial evidence supporting the jury’s finding that her claims
accrued on May 23, 2017 because she believed that the vehicle could be repaired
until that time.[1]
Plaintiff additionally argues that Defendant bore the burden of proof at trial
concerning their statute of limitations defense. 
 
There was substantial evidence at trial supporting the
jury’s finding that Plaintiff’s claim was timely.
 
Accordingly, the court DENIES Defendant’s motion for JNOV
on statute of limitations grounds.
 
Cover Damages
 
Defendant contends Plaintiff was not entitled to “cover car”
damages because they put her in a better position than had she never purchased
the Subject Vehicle and “cover” damages are not available in the context of
commercial transactions, not for Song-Beverly violations. Plaintiff argues the
court already rejected this argument when ruling on Defendant’s Motion in
Limine No. 8. Additionally, Plaintiff argues that under the California Uniform
Commercial Code (CUCC) Sec. 27115(1) allows these damages as incidental damages
and, alternatively, that CUCC Sec. 2712 separately allows recovery as a covered
car.[2]
Plaintiff further argues that Defendant waived their argument that Plaintiff
failed to justifiably revoke acceptance because they did not request a jury
instruction on the issue. 
 
There was substantial evidence at trial supporting the
jury’s finding for Plaintiff’s damages.
 
According, the court DENIES Defendant’s motion for
partial JNOV as to “cover” damages.
 
Civil Penalty
 
Defendant contends that the civil penalty should be reduced
to no more than $65,968.24 reflecting double the amount of the revised total
damages amount after the appropriate “incidental” damages reduction as
discussed above. 
 
In light of the above denial, this argument is moot.
 
New Trial
 
Defendant makes substantially the same arguments as for the
JNOV motion. 
 
Not only was there substantial evidence at trial to support
the jury’s findings, the Court, sitting as a “thirteenth juror” independently
reviewing the evidence, concurs with the jury’s verdict. In sum, Defendant has
not met the standard under CCP § 657 demonstrating legal
error, excessive damages or insufficiency of the evidence.
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion
for new trial is DENIED.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Motion
for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict is DENIED;
2.      
Motion for New Trial is DENIED.
 
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
