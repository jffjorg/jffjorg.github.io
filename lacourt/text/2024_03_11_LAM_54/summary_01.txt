And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Martina A. Silas vs. The Fox Law Corporation, Inc. et al. The ruling denies both the defendants' motion for summary adjudication and the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication.

The defendants had moved for summary adjudication of the plaintiff's eleventh cause of action for declaratory relief and their fifteenth affirmative defense for lack of ownership. They argued that most of the funds paid by James Arden, a third-party, were his inheritance funds and not subject to the assignment order obtained by the plaintiff. The court finds that the defendants' motion does not completely dispose of the cause of action or affirmative defense and is therefore denied.

The plaintiff had moved for summary adjudication of the defendants' fifteenth affirmative defense for lack of ownership. The plaintiff argued that Arden held any funds subject to the assignment order in a constructive trust and therefore any subsequent deposits from non-assigned funds remain part of the trust. The court finds that the parties dispute whether the "lowest intermediate balance" analysis is necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was the rightful owner of the funds paid to the defendants and therefore there is a triable issue of fact and the motion is denied.

The court also notes that the defendants' motion did not address procedural defects in reply and that there is no stipulation or declaration to adjudicate the issues jointly. As a result, the court denies the defendants' motion for summary adjudication.
