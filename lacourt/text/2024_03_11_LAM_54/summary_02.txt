And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies Defendant's motions to compel further responses to discovery requests for special interrogatories, requests for production of documents, and requests for admission, except for one interrogatory. The Plaintiff's motions to compel further responses to discovery are also denied. The Plaintiff's motion for protective order is denied as well, as there is no showing of good cause to protect any confidential information. The Plaintiff is ordered to serve further responses to discovery within 20 days of notice of ruling.
