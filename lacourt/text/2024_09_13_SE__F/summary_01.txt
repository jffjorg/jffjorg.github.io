And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to continue the trial from October 28, 2024 to March 24, 2025. The defendant argued that there was a significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case, specifically the recent discovery of new parties and the need for additional time to prepare for trial. The court considered the factors outlined in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, including the proximity of the trial date, the length of the continuance requested, and the potential prejudice to parties and witnesses. The court found that the defendant's arguments provided good cause for the continuance, and therefore granted the motion.
