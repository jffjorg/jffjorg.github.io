This action is related to Sara Diba
v. Khosroabadi Alireza (23VECV04983).
 
[Tentative]
Ruling
 
Defendant Khosroabadi Alireza’s Motion
for Protective Order is GRANTED. 
 
discusion
 
Defendant Khosroabadi Alireza seeks a
protective order precluding his deposition from going forward on March 21, 2024
and continuing the same to late June. In addition, Defendant seeks sanctions in
the amount of $560.00, jointly and severally as to Plaintiffs Shabnam Mahdavi Doraji
and Ali Seyed Taheri. 
 
“Before, during, or after a deposition, any party,
any deponent, or any other affected natural person or organization may promptly
move for a protective order. The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (CCP §2025.420(a).)¿¿ 
 
For good cause shown, the Court may issue any order
that “justice requires to protect any party from unwarranted annoyance,
embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense.” (CCP
§2025.420(b).)¿Section 2025.420(b) provides a nonexclusive list of directions
that may be included in a protective order, including orders directing that the
deposition may not be taken at all or that the deposition be taken at a
different time.¿ (CCP §2025.420(b).)¿
 
First, the court briefly notes Defendant’s
contention that the opposition is untimely and they did not receive a copy of
the opposition. Plaintiff did submit a proof of service with their opposition.
It is unclear why Defendant did not receive it. The court does note the
opposition was filed two days late. However, as Defendant has filed a reply
that addresses the merits of Plaintiff’s opposition, the Court finds Defendant
has waived any procedural defects. (See Carlton v. Quint (2000) 77
Cal.App.4th 690, 697.) Therefore, the Court will consider Plaintiff’s
opposition. 
 
Defendant argues neither himself nor his attorney were
able to proceed with the deposition noticed for March 21, 2024. According to
Defendant, Plaintiffs unilaterally scheduled and served Defendant a notice of
taking deposition on March 6, 2024 to be taken March 21, 2024. However, both
Defendant and Defense counsel were unavailable that date and reached out to
Plaintiff’s counsel to reschedule. Defense counsel was ill and could not meet
with their client to prepare for the deposition. Defendant was also unavailable
that day due to clinic and patient obligations. Defendant also notes they would
not be available for deposition from the latter part of April through May due
to the fact that he will be on a medical mission in Nepal. However, Plaintiffs
never responded to Defendant’s request and now Defendant seeks a protective
order. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues in view of the fact
that the deposition dates are long since passed and Defendant failed to appear,
the question of a protective order is moot as a matter of law. Moreover,
Defendant failed to adequately meet and confer. 
 
The court finds good cause to have the deposition
taken at another time. Although the date has passed, a party may obtain an
order regarding the timing of a deposition under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2025.420. Defendant has stated they would not be available through May
2024 for deposition as they will be out of the country. Defendant has stated
they attempted to resolve the issue informally but never heard from Plaintiff. (Shaghzo
Decl., Exh. C.) 
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion for protective order
is GRANTED. The parties are to meet and confer to set up a date, time, and
place for the deposition to occur upon Defendant’s return. 
 
Sanctions
 
Both parties request sanctions. Defendant requests $560.00 in sanctions. Plaintiff requests $2,700.00 in
sanctions. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 authorizes
the Court to impose monetary sanctions on any attorney engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process by requiring that attorney to pay the reasonable
expenses incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. (CCP § 2023.030.)
Moreover, the Court “shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion for a protective order under this
section, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” (CCP § 2025.420(h).) 

 
The court denies both parties’ request for
sanctions.  This entire dispute should
have been resolved by counsel through the meet and confer process.
