And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge issued a tentative ruling on a motion by Defendant Khosroabadi Alireza for a protective order to delay the deposition scheduled for March 21, 2024. Defendant had claimed that he was unable to attend the original date due to medical obligations and that plaintiff failed to respond to his requests to reschedule the deposition. Plaintiff opposed the motion, arguing that the deposition dates have passed and defendant failed to adequately meet and confer. The Judge granted the motion, finding good cause to have the deposition taken at a later date, and ordered the parties to meet and confer to set up a new date, time, and place for the deposition. The Judge also denied both parties' requests for sanctions.
