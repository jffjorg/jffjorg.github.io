The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Jennifer Sari, the plaintiff, and MG Carillon Apartments, LLC, MG Carillon Apartments Sea, LLC, and Gleiberman Properties, INC. dba MG Properties, LLC, the defendants. The defendants had filed a demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint, alleging that the complaint failed to state a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The Judge found that the plaintiff's complaint sufficiently alleged a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress and overruled the demurrer. The Judge also denied the defendants' motion to strike the complaint, finding that the plaintiff's allegations were sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages.
