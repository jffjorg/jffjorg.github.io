  Case Number:  19PSCV00178    Hearing Date:   March 5, 2024    Dept:  K Plaintiff Derek
Siri’s Motion to Set Aside Order and/or for Reconsideration is DENIED in full.
Background   
Plaintiff Derek
Siri (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
On February 16, 2018, Plaintiff was
injured during an altercation with Dwayne Cooper aka Duane Cooper (“Cooper”), a
Fire Inspector for the Los Angeles County Fire Department (“LACFD”), after he
discovered Cooper engaged in sexual conduct with Plaintiff’s wife. Plaintiff
thereafter went to LACFD Station #32 in Azusa to file a complaint against
Cooper, but John Doe Fire Captain ended up making a false police report in
which he blamed Plaintiff for the disturbance.
On March 11, 2020, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended
Complaint (“SAC”), asserting causes of action against Cooper, County of Los
Angeles (“County”), LACFD, John Doe Fire Captain and Does 1-50 for:
1.                 
Intentional Interference with Prospective
Economic Relations
2.                 
Trespass
3.                 
Private Nuisance
4.                 
Negligence
5.                 
Assault
6.                 
Battery
7.                 
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
8.                 
Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress
9.                 
Negligent Hiring, Retention and Supervision
10.             
False Imprisonment 
On November 24, 2020, the court sustained County’s demurrer
to the Second through Fourth, and Seventh and Eighth Causes of Action, without leave
to amend. The court also sustained Cooper’s demurrer to the Second through Fourth,
and Seventh and Eighth Causes of Action, without leave to amend.
On January 4, 2021, an “Order Re: Stipulation Concerning
Stricken Language of Nonconsensual Actions in Plaintiff’s Second Amended
Complaint” was filed. On January 6, 2021, a “Court Order Re: Stricken Language
in the Second Amended Complaint” was filed, wherein portions of Paragraphs 19,
46, 49 and 52 were stricken from the SAC.
On June 30, 2022, the court granted County’s Motion for
Summary Judgment. On July 1, 2022, “Judgment on Defendant County of Los
Angeles’ Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Summary
Adjudication” was entered.
On November 14, 2022, an “Order Denying Defendant Duane
Cooper’s Motion for Summary Judgment and, Alternatively, Granting, in Part, and
Denying, in Part, Motion for Summary Adjudication” was entered, wherein
Plaintiff’s first and tenth causes of action were adjudicated in Cooper’s
favor.
The case proceeded to jury trial on July 26, 2023. On August
10, 2023, judgment was entered. On August 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed (and served
via email) a “Notice of Entry of Judgment.”
On October 31, 2023, the court granted judgment
notwithstanding the verdict on its own motion pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure § 629(a). On November 6, 2024, a “Memorandum Denying Defendant Duane
Cooper’s Motion for New Trial and Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the
Verdict (‘JNOV’) and Granting Court’s JNOV in Favor of Defendant Cooper
Concerning Medical Expenses and Punitive Damages” was filed.
On November 13, 2023, the “Order for Judgment
Notwithstanding the Verdict” and “Judgment” were entered.
Discussion
Plaintiff moves the court to set aside its order filed
November 6, 223 and/or for reconsideration of the court’s grant of judgment
notwithstanding the verdict on its own motion.
Request for Judicial Notice
The court rules on Defendant’s Request for Judicial Notice
(“RJN”) as follows: Granted as to Exhibit A (i.e., October 31, 2023 minute
order) and Granted as to Exhibit B (i.e., Memorandum Denying Defendant Duane
Cooper’s Motion for New Trial and Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the
Verdict (‘JNOV’) and Granting Court’s JNOV in Favor of Defendant Cooper
Concerning Medical Expenses and Punitive Damages” filed November 6, 2023).
Merits
Plaintiff first seeks reconsideration of the court’s
judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration is
summarily denied on the basis of lack of jurisdiction. “A court may reconsider its
order granting or denying a motion and may even reconsider or alter its
judgment so long as judgment has not yet been entered. Once judgment has been
entered, however, the court may not reconsider it and loses its unrestricted power to change the judgment. It may
correct judicial error only through certain limited procedures such as motions
for new trial and motions to vacate the judgment.” (Passavanti v. Williams
(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 1602, 1606.) The motion was filed on November 13,
2023; however, the “Order for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict” and
“Judgment” were entered that same day. The court cannot rule on the
reconsideration aspect of the motion.
At any rate, Plaintiff has not articulated any “new or
different facts, circumstances, or law,” as required by Code of Civil Procedure
§ 1008; rather, Plaintiff’s argument is that he disagrees with the court’s
November 6, 2023 memorandum setting forth the reasons for its October 31, 2023
rulings.
Plaintiff then asserts that the court’s ruling on its own
judgment notwithstanding the verdict is “void and late as a matter of law”
because “[t]he court lost jurisdiction to rule[] after October 31, 2023.”
(Motion, 2:3-4 and 3:16-17). This argument, however, ignores the fact that the
court granted its judgment notwithstanding the verdict on October 31, 2023.
(RJN, Exh. A). Code of Civil Procedure § 660, subdivision (c) states, in
pertinent part, that “[a] motion for new trial is not determined within the
meaning of this section until an order ruling on the motion is entered in the
permanent minutes of the court or signed by the judgment and filed with the
clerk. The entry of a new trial order in the permanent minutes of the court
shall constitute a determination of the motion even though that minute order,
as entered, expressly directs that a written order be prepared, signed, and
filed . . .”
The court’s November 6, 2023 memorandum was prepared and
entered in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure § 657, which provides, in
relevant part, that “[i]f an order granting such motion does not contain [a]
specification of reasons [for granting a new trial], the court must, within 10
days after filing such order, prepare, sign and file such specification of
reasons in writing with the clerk. The court shall not direct the attorney for
a party to prepare either or both said order and said specification of
reasons.”
Plaintiff’s citation to Powell v. County of Orange
(2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 1572 and Banning v. Newdow (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th
438 for the proposition that “[a]n unsigned minute order, is. . . not valid for
purposes of granting a JNOV based upon 629(a)” is misplaced. In Powell,
an unsigned minute order was issued dismissing the action without prejudice for
lack of prosecution. Plaintiff filed a motion to set aside the dismissal, which
was denied, as was a subsequent motion for reconsideration.  The Court of Appeal there held that the order
denying the motion for reconsideration was not an appealable order and that an
unsigned minute order of dismissal was not effective as a judgment under Code
of Civil Procedure § 581d[1]. Banning
involved a father’s appeal of an order requiring him to pay a portion of the
mother’s attorney’s fees in child custody proceedings pursuant to Family Code §
7640. Neither case involved a judgment notwithstanding the verdict or Code of
Civil Procedure § 629.
Plaintiff’s complaints about the propriety of the court’s
October 13, 2023 minute order are irrelevant to his jurisdictional argument. The
October 13, 2023 minute order, moreover, does not constitute a “new or
different fact[], circumstance[] or law,” inasmuch as it was in existence at
the time of the court’s October 31, 2023 minute order and November 6, 2023
memorandum.
The motion is denied.
