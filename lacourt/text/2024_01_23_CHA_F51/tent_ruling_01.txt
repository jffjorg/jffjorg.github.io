DEMURRER WITH
MOTION TO STRIKE

Los Angeles Superior Court Case
# 23CHCP00018

 
Demurrer with Motion to Strike Filed: 5/19/23
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendants Albert Gonzalez, Jr.; and
Albert Gonzalez, Sr. (collectively, “Defendants”) 
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Daniel Torres (“Plaintiff”)
NOTICE: OK
 
TENTATIVE RULING: The hearings on both Defendants’
demurrers and motions to strike are continued to 3/21/24.
 
ANALYSIS
 
On 1/18/23, Plaintiff filed his
complaint, alleging against Defendants and nonmoving defendant ALALDA, LLC the
following causes of action: (1) Dissolution of Limited Liability Company; (2)
Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (3) Accounting; (4) Declaratory Relief; and (5)
Conversion.
 
On 5/19/23, Defendants each
respectively filed a demurrer with motion to strike against Plaintiff’s
complaint. However, the Court notes that Defendants reserved only one hearing
for the two separate motions. On 1/9/24, Plaintiff filed his opposition to Defendant
Albert Gonzalez, Jr.’s’ demurrer and motion to strike. On 1/12/24, Defendants
filed a joint reply.
 
Based on the foregoing and based on
Defendants’ counsel’s representations that he erroneously reserved one hearing
for two separate motions, the Court continues the hearings on both demurrers
and motions to strike to 3/21/24 to afford the parties the opportunity to file
their oppositions and replies thereto.
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The hearings on both Defendants’ demurrers and motions to
strike are continued to 3/21/24.
