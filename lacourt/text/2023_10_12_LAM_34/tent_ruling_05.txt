 Case Number:  23STCV01630    Hearing Date:   October 12, 2023    Dept:  34 SUBJECT:        Motion for  Terminating Sanctions Against Plaintiff Ramish Manglani   Moving Party: Defendant  Ha-Rakhamon Farhod Azizi Resp. Party:    Plaintiff Ramish Manglani     The Motion is  DENIED.    BACKGROUND:           On  January 25, 2023, Plaintiffs Eliyaho Schefres and Ramish Manglani filed their  Complaint against Defendant Ha-Rakhamon Farhod Azizi (erroneously sued as Azizi  Ha Rakhamon Farhod) on causes of action arising from alleged negligence.            On  April 21, 2023, Defendant filed his Answer to the Complaint.            On  May 24, 2023, Defendant/Cross-Complainant Ha-Rakhamon Farhod Azizi filed his  Cross-Complaint against Cross-Defendants Peter Velasquez Hernandez, Daniel  Anselmo Arroyo, and Cali Exotic Rentals.            On  August 1, 2023, the Court ordered Plaintiff Ramish Manglani (but not Plaintiff  Eliyaho Schefres) to provide initial responses to the form interrogatories  (“FROGs”) and special interrogatories (“SROGs”) propounded by  Defendant/Cross-Complainant within 14 days of the issuance of that Order. The  Court also deemed admitted the requests for admission (“RFAs”) that  Defendant/Cross-Complainant had propounded upon Plaintiff Ramish Manglani.            On  September 8, 2023, Defendant/Cross-Complainant filed his Motion for Terminating  Sanctions against Plaintiff Ramish Manglani (“Motion”). In support of his  Motion, Defendant/Cross-Complainant concurrently filed Declaration of Ronnie  Kashri.            On  October 3, 2023, Plaintiff Ramish Manglani filed Declaration of John F. Bazan  in Opposition to the Motion (“Declaration in Opposition”). Plaintiff Ramish  Manglani did not file a memorandum of points and authorities in opposition to  the Motion, nor did Plaintiff Eliyaho Schefres file anything regarding the  Motion.            On  October 5, 2023, Defendant/Cross-Complainant filed his Reply regarding the  Motion.    ANALYSIS:   I.           Legal  Standard   Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 gives  the court the discretion to impose sanctions against anyone engaging in a  misuse of the discovery process. A court may impose terminating sanctions by  striking pleadings of the party engaged in misuse of discovery or entering  default judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).) A violation of a  discovery order is sufficient for the imposition of terminating sanctions. (Collison  & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620.) Terminating  sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in disobeying the court's  orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 795–796.)   A terminating sanction is a "drastic  measure which should be employed with caution." (Deyo, supra,  at p. 793.)    "A decision to order terminating  sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful,  preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe  sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial  court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky v.  Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279–280.)   While the court has discretion to impose  terminating sanctions, these sanctions "should be appropriate to the  dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to protect the  interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery." (Deyo, supra,  84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) "[A] court is empowered to apply the ultimate  sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with  his discovery obligations." (Id.) Discovery sanctions are not to be  imposed for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure of  discovery to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of information. (See Midwife  v. Bernal (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 57, 64 [superseded on other grounds as  stated in Kohan v. Cohan (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 967, 971.)   "A trial court has broad discretion to  impose discovery sanctions, but two facts are generally prerequisite to the  imposition of nonmonetary sanctions . . . (1) absent unusual circumstances, there  must be a failure to comply with a court order, and (2) the failure must be  willful." (Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315,  1327; but see Reedy v. Bussell (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1272, 1291  ["willfulness is no longer a requirement for the imposition of discovery  sanctions."].)   II.       Discussion    Defendant/Cross-Complainant moves the Court to issue terminating  sanctions and monetary sanctions against Plaintiff Ramish Manglani and in favor  of Defendant/Cross-Complainant. (Motion, p. 5:12–15.)  Defendant/Cross-Complainant argues: (1) that the Court has broad discretion to  impose terminating sanctions; and (2) that willful discovery abuses require  terminating sanctions. (Id. at pp. 3:10, 4:24.)   Plaintiff Ramish Manglani did not file a memorandum of points and  authorities (nor was he required to do so). But his Counsel (John F. Bazan) did  file (an untimely) Declaration in Opposition. The Court chooses to consider the  Declaration in Opposition.    Among other things, Counsel Bazan declares: (1) that he has only spoken  to Plaintiff Ramish Manglani once; (2) that he was under the impression he  substituted out of his representation of both Plaintiffs in or around April 23,  2023; (3) that he was under the impression that he was completely out of the  case after April 23, 2023; (4) that as of October 3, 2023, he became aware that  he had not substituted out of the case regarding Plaintiff Ramish Manglani; and  (5) that he admits to his mistake and inadvertence regarding this issue. (Decl.  in Opp’n, ¶¶ 4–7, 9, 14.)   In his Reply, Defendant/Cross-Complainant argues: (1) that Plaintiff  Ramish Manglani abandoned his case or never intended a lawsuit to be filed; (2)  that the Declaration in Opposition does not address receiving documents by  mail; and (3) that the Declaration in Opposition is conclusory and does not  address how Counsel Bazan was under the wrong impression. (Reply, pp. 2:1–2,  2:15–16, 3:3–4.)   The question at hand is whether less severe sanctions than terminating  sanctions would produce compliance with the discovery rules. (Mileikowsky,  supra, 128 Cal.App.4th at pp. 279–280.) Upon considering the Declaration  in Opposition, the answer is yes. Now that Counsel Bazan is engaged in this  matter, the Court has reason to believe that Plaintiff Manglani will comply  with the discovery rules. Thus, terminating sanctions are not appropriate at  this time.    That only leaves the question of whether to impose monetary sanctions. The  Court declines to award monetary sanctions. Among other reasons, Defense  counsel has requested 11.5 hours of attorney's fees for a 5-page MPA.  Defense counsel was admitted to the bar in  2010, and with the exception of 4 months in 2016, has been an active member of  the bar since that time.   The MPA submitted has a cursory analysis of  the law; it appears to have been copied-and-pasted from a Rutter-Guide summary.   “If . .  . the Court were required to award a reasonable fee when an outrageously  unreasonable one has been asked for, claimants would be encouraged to make  unreasonable demands, knowing that the only unfavorable consequence of such  misconduct would be reduction of their fee to what they should have asked in  the first place. To discourage such greed, a severer reaction is needful.”  (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d  621, 635 [cleaned up].)   “A fee request  that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance permitting the trial court to  reduce the award or deny one altogether.” (Chavez v. City of Los Angeles  (2010) 47 Cal.4th 970, 990; Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,  1137; Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635.)      III.      Conclusion   The Motion is  DENIED.
