And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint is granted in part. The punitive damages are stricken from the breach of contract claim, but the request for punitive damages remains in the non-contract causes of action. The court agrees that punitive damages are unavailable for breach of contract claims, but the plaintiff is entitled to allege that the defendant acted with oppression, fraud, and/or malice on the non-contract causes of action.
