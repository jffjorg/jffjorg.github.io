And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, Eddie Navarrette, against the Second Amended Complaint of the plaintiffs, Spaciot, LLC and Alessandro Paciotti. The demurrer argues that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and that the third cause of action for intentional misrepresentation fails.

The Judge agrees with the defendant that the complaint is insufficient and lacks specificity, particularly in paragraphs 10 and 40. The Judge notes that the complaint does not provide sufficient information about how the defendant is responsible for the alleged acts and that the language in the complaint remains unclear.

The Judge sustains the demurrer with leave to amend, allowing the plaintiffs to cure the defects in the complaint. The Judge encourages the plaintiffs to add the required information and requests leave to amend.

The ruling does not reach the argument about intentional misrepresentation.
