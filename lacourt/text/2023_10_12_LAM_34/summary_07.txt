And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the complaint is sustained, and the case is dismissed. The plaintiff, Meera Paul, filed a complaint seeking declaratory relief, but the defendant, Gurmit Paul, argued that the complaint does not state a sufficient cause of action. The plaintiff did not oppose the demurrer, and the Judge agrees with the defendant's argument that the complaint is unclear about the bases for the declaratory relief sought. The Judge notes that the plaintiff's counsel did not request leave to amend the complaint at the hearing, and therefore the case is dismissed.
