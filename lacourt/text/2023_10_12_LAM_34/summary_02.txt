Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment and dismissed the complaint. The plaintiff, Timothy Burke, filed the complaint against the defendants, The Wizard of Construction, Inc., A Perfect View Builders, Inc., and Oz Mizrahi, alleging that the contract signed by his father, Norman Burke, was invalid due to elder abuse and fraud. However, the judge found that the plaintiff had not provided sufficient evidence to prove his claims. The judge noted that the majority of the evidence presented was inadmissible hearsay, and that the plaintiff's own declaration was the only admissible evidence presented. The judge also found that the property tax bills mentioned in the complaint had not been provided, and that no evidence of the contract had been submitted. Without sufficient evidence, the judge could not grant the plaintiff's request for default judgment.
