And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to form interrogatories as moot, since the initial responses were filed just hours after the motion was filed. The judge has also denied the defendant's request for monetary sanctions, finding that the plaintiff's counsel had been in good faith contact with the defendant's counsel and that there was no bad faith on the part of the plaintiff. The judge's decision is based on California Code of Civil Procedure, which requires a response to form interrogatories within 30 days of service, and allows for monetary sanctions to be imposed if a party fails to respond.
