ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal
Standard
 
“Any party to an
arbitration in which an award has been made may petition the court to confirm,
correct or vacate the award. The petition shall name as respondents all parties
to the arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound by the
arbitration award.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.) 
 
“A petition under this chapter shall:
 
(a)      
“Set
forth the substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate
unless the petitioner denies the existence of such an agreement.
 
(b)      
“Set
forth names of the arbitrators.
 
(c)       
“Set
forth or have attached a copy of the award and the written opinion of the
arbitrators, if any.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
1285.4, subds. (a)–(c).)
 
“If a petition or
response under this chapter is duly served and filed, the court shall confirm
the award as made, whether rendered in this state or another state, unless in
accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and confirms it as
corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceedings.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1286.)
 
“If an award is
confirmed, judgment shall be entered in conformity therewith. The judgment so
entered has the same force and effect as, and is subject to all the provisions
of law relating to, a judgment in a civil action of the same jurisdictional
classification; and it may be enforced like any other judgment of the court in
which it is entered, in an action of the same jurisdictional classification.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1287.4.)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
On November 30, 2022, the Arbitrator, Kirk D. Yake, awarded a “Final
Award of Arbitrator” in the total amount of $164,079.44 in favor of Petitioner
and against Respondent. (Proposed Judgment, Exh. A, pp. 1, 9–10.) The award was
comprised of $106,000.00 for disgorgement of payment, $36,414.44 in net damages
for breach of contract, and $21,665.00 in attorney’s fees. (Ibid.) The
Parties were ordered to bear their own costs. (Ibid.)
 
        On April 17, 2023, Petitioner filed the
Petition. Petitioner requests: (1) confirmation of the award and entry of
judgment according to it; (2) prejudgment interest from November 30, 2022 at
the statutory rate; (3) costs of suit in the amount of $515.00; and (4)
attorney’s fees in the amount of $397.50. (Petition, Item 10.)
 
        Petitioner argues: (1) that the Court is
authorized to confirm an arbitration award upon petition of a party to the
arbitration; (2) that Petitioner is entitled to judgment awarding attorney’s
fees and costs pursuant to the agreement to arbitrate; (3) that Petitioner is
entitled to prejudgment interest; and (4) that Respondent will be properly
noticed and served the Petition and supporting papers. (Memorandum, pp. 4:6–7,
5:1–2, 5:16, 6:1–2.)
 
        Petitioner followed all the requirements
of Code of Civil Procedure sections 1285, 1285.4, and 1286. As the Court is not
correcting the award, vacating the award, or dismissing the proceedings, the
Court must confirm the award as made. 
 
        As Petitioner is the prevailing party
and there is an applicable attorney’s fees provision, Petitioner is entitled to
additional attorney’s fees and costs incurred during the post-award, pre-judgment
period. (Petition, Attachment 4(b), Attachment, Section 11; Code Civ. Proc., §§
1032, subds. (a)(4), (b), 1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(B), 1293.2; see also Marcus
& Millichap Real Estate Inv. Brokerage Co. v. Woodman Inv. Grp. (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 508, 513.) 
 
However, the fees and costs must be reasonable. Here, Petitioner
requests an additional $2,250.00 in fees (six hours of work at $375.00 per
hour) and an additional $690.08 in costs. While the hourly rate is reasonable,
a review of the invoice indicates that the number of hours and costs requested
are excessive. For example, more than 3.5 hours are claimed for the combined
acts of drafting this very simple, unopposed petition and its related
documents. Similarly, “costs” are claimed for various items that are not costs
charged by the Court or otherwise allowable as costs. The Court will allow 4.0
hours of work at the requested hourly rate (totaling $1,500.00 in fees) and
$500.00 in costs. 
 
Finally, as the issue in this case involves contractual damages
(certain damages which appear to have been liquidated and other damages which
appear to have been unliquidated prior to the Final Award of Arbitrator),
Petitioner is now entitled to the requested relief of prejudgment interest from
the date of the arbitration award to the date of judgment. (Civ. Code, § 3287,
subds. (a), (b); see Tenzera, Inc. v. Osterman (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th
16, 21–22 [“Section 3287 applies to arbitration awards. A prevailing party in
arbitration is entitled to prejudgment interest as of the date of the final
award to entry of judgment.”].) Further, as Petitioner correctly argues, the
attorney’s fees portion of the Final Award of Arbitrator is allowable in this
calculation of prejudgment interest. (Britz, Inc. v. Alfa-Laval Food &
Dairy Co. (1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 1085, 1107 [“The arbitration award was the
contractual equivalent of a judgment in respondents’ favor. In the context of a
judicial judgment, it is clear that interest after judgment accrues as to the
entire award, including attorney fees.”].) Petitioner correctly calculates the
correct amount of prejudgment interest to be $14,205.23, which is based on a
damages award of $164,079.44, an interest rate of 10% for a contract claim, and
316 days from date of entry of arbitration award (November 30, 2022) to date of
entry of judgment (October 12, 2023). 
 
        The Court GRANTS in part the
Petition.  
 
The Court CONFIRMS the Arbitration Award. 
 
        The Court AWARDS $1,400.00 in attorney’s
fees, $500.00 in costs, and $14,205.23 in prejudgment interest favor of
Petitioner and against Respondent. 
 
III.    
Conclusion
 
The Petition is GRANTED in part. 
 
The Arbitration Award is CONFIRMED. 
 
        Attorney’s fees, costs, and prejudgment
interest are AWARDED in the total amount of $16,105.23 in favor of Petitioner
and against Respondent.
