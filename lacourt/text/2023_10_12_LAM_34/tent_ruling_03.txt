ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal
Standard
 
California Code of Civil Procedure requires a response
from the party to whom form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and
demand requests are propounded within 30 days after service of the requests,
unless the time is extended by agreement of the parties. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.260, subd. (a), 2030.270, subd. (a), 2031.260, subd. (a), 2031.270, subd.
(a).) If a party fails to serve timely responses, "the party making the
demand may move for an order compelling response to the demand.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b).) By failing to respond, the offending party
waives any objection to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)
 
For a motion to compel, all a propounding
party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the
time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were
directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Super. Ct.
(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905, 906.) Indeed, "[o]nce [a party] 'fail[ed]
to serve a timely response,' the trial court had authority to grant [opposing
party's] motion to compel responses." (Sinaiko Healthcare Counseling,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 405.)
 
The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel motions for
interrogatories or requests for production, unless the Court finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an
order compelling answers, the court may make those orders that are just,
including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
Defendant
moves the Court to compel Plaintiff to serve responses to the form
interrogatories (“FROGs”) that Defendant propounded on June 21, 2023. (FROGs
Motion, p. 4:24–26, 8:14–19, and Exh. 1, p. 9.) According to Defense Counsel,
Plaintiff has not responded to the FROGs. (FROGs Motion, Decl. Fidler, ¶¶ 5,
7.)
 
        However,
Plaintiff’s Counsel declares that the responses were filed just hours after the
FROGs Motion was filed, and that Plaintiff’s Counsel had been in contact with
Defense Counsel for weeks in an effort to keep Defense Counsel apprised of the
situation. (Opposition, pp. 3–4; Decl. Eballar, ¶¶ 6–12.)
 
        As
the initial responses have been served, the FROGs Motion is moot. 
 
        Defendant
has also requested monetary sanctions. However, given what appears to be a
misunderstanding and subsequent good faith effort by Plaintiff’s Counsel,
monetary sanctions are not warranted here. 
 
        The
Court DENIES as moot the FROGs Motion. 
 
        The
Court DENIES Defendant’s Request for Sanctions. 
 
III.     Conclusion
 
The FROGs
Motion is DENIED as moot. 
 
        Defendant’s
Request for Sanctions is DENIED.
