And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendant's/Cross-Complainant's motion for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff Ramish Manglani. The Defendant/Cross-Complainant had argued that Plaintiff Manglani's failure to comply with discovery orders justified the imposition of terminating sanctions. The Judge, however, found that less severe sanctions would be sufficient to encourage compliance with the discovery rules, given that Counsel Bazan has now taken responsibility for the case and will likely ensure that Plaintiff Manglani complies with the discovery orders. The Judge also declined to award monetary sanctions, finding that the Defendant's/Cross-Complainant's request for attorney's fees was unreasonably inflated.
