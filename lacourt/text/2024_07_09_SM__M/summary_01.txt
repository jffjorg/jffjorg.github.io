Summary Text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case Amaya v. General Motors LLC, case number 23SMCV00933. The defendant, General Motors LLC, demurs to the First Amended Complaint, arguing that the statute of limitations bars the first and second causes of action. The judge sustains the demurrer with leave to amend as to the first cause of action, which alleges fraud. The judge also overrules the demurrer as to the second cause of action, which alleges violations of the Unfair Competition Law (UCL) and the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The judge concludes that the UCL claim is well-stated and that the FAC pleads the elements required for an "unlawful" UCL claim. The judge also grants the motion to strike the punitive damages claim, as it is moot. Plaintiff has 20 days to file an amended complaint.
