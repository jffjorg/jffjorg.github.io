Complaint  
HEARING DATE:   7/9/2024
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed. (CCP §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff
need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the
factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28
Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the
construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore
Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations
omitted.) 
 
A special demurrer for uncertainty is
disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that
defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what
issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed
against him/her. (CCP § 430.10(f); Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat
vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)  
 
Any party, within the time allowed to
respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole
or any part thereof. (CCP § 435(b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1322(b).)
The court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion and upon terms it
deems proper: (1) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted
in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of
the court. (CCP §§ 436(a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767,
782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage;
probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].) 
 
“Liberality in permitting amendment is
the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to show¿in
what manner¿plaintiff can amend the complaint, and¿how¿that
amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading.¿(Id.) 
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Defendant
General Motors LLC demurs to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) and moves to
strike punitive damages. GM argues that the 3-year statute of limitations for
fraud bars the first and second causes of action. GM also argues that both
causes of action fail under the pleading standards for fraud. 
 
Fraud Cause of
Action
 
The statute of limitations for fraud is
three years. (CCP § 338(d).) “Generally, a cause of action accrues and the
statute of limitation begins to run when a suit may be maintained. Ordinarily
this is when the wrongful act is done and the obligation or the liability
arises . . .. In other words, a cause of action accrues upon the occurrence of
the last element essential to the cause of action. [Citation.]” (Cobb v.
City of Stockton (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 65, 72-73, alterations and
internal quotation marks omitted.) Under the so-called “discovery
rule,” the accrual of the statute is tolled until a plaintiff discovers, or has
reason to discover, the cause of action. The discovery rule protects those who
are ignorant of their cause of action through no fault of their own. (April
Enterprises, Inc. v. KTTV (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 805, 832.) Unless a complaint affirmatively
discloses on its face that the statute of limitations has run, demurrer must be
overruled. (Lockley v. Law Office of Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz &
McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875, 881.)
 
On
June 28, 2019, Plaintiff travelled to an authorized Chevrolet dealership and
leased the subject vehicle, a 2019 Chevrolet Bolt EV. (FAC ¶ 8.) According to
the FAC, during this process, GM intentionally and knowingly concealed certain
material facts regarding the defective high voltage battery pack in the
Vehicle. In reliance on these omissions, Plaintiff purchased the vehicle on
that date. GM delivered the vehicle to Plaintiff “with serious defects and
nonconformities to warranty” including the battery defect. (FAC ¶ 10.)
Plaintiff would not have leased the Vehicle if she knew of the battery defect.
(FAC ¶ 12.) These allegations show that all elements of the fraud cause of
action were complete on June 28, 2019. On the face of the FAC, the three-year
statute of limitations accrued on that date, and expired three years later, on June
28, 2022. Plaintiff did not file the instant fraud action until eight months
later – February 28, 2023. Plaintiff fails to plead any facts justifying her
late filing, such as delayed discovery of the fraud. Plaintiff also does not
address this issue in opposition. 
 
The Court also concurs that the fraud
cause of action IS not stated with sufficient particularity. Plaintiff argues
that “[t]he requirement of specificity is relaxed when the
allegations indicate that the defendant must necessarily possess full
information concerning the facts of the controversy or when the facts lie more
in the knowledge of the opposite party.” (Tarmann v. State Farm Mutual
Auto-Mobile Ins. Co. (1992) 2 Cal. App. 4th 153, 158.) However, the FAC
makes clear that Plaintiff possesses the facts of the representations she
relied on in leasing the Vehicle. Plaintiff
alleges that a salesperson made certain representations to her but does not
disclose such statements. (FAC ¶ 8.) “The salesperson spoke to
Plaintiff about the Vehicle, how far it could drive on a single charge, and
all of its features. Due to the lack of extensive EV infrastructure and
Plaintiff’s driving needs, it was vitally important to Plaintiff that the
Vehicle could go at least 230 miles on a single charge. Once Plaintiff was
satisfied by the representations made by the salesperson and by Defendant
Manufacturer through its advertisements and publications that the Vehicle’s
range on a single charge was 238 miles, she decided to lease the Vehicle.” (Id.,
emphasis added.) Plaintiff thereby
alleges that GM and its representatives made representations concerning the Vehicle,
including the Vehicle’s battery and range. Since these representations were
made to Plaintiff, she must necessarily possess full information of the salesperson’s
specific representations. Thus, Plaintiff must plead such information in line
with the heightened pleading standards of fraud.
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s demurrer
is SUSTAINED with leave to
amend as to the first cause of action.
 
UCL
 
First, GM does not show that the statute of limitations bars
this claim. The statute of limitations for a UCL claim is four
years. (Bus. & Prof. Code § 17208.) This four-year statute of limitations
applies even if the borrowed law provides a shorter statute of limitations. (Cortez
v. Purolator Air Filtration Products Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 163, 178-79 [time-barred
action still viable as a UCL action seeking restitution].) Thus, the shorter
three-year statute cited by GM applying to fraud causes of action does not bar
the UCL claim.
 
            Second, the UCL claim is well stated
as to the unlawful and fraud prongs. Business and Professions Code section 17200
prohibits “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.” (Bus.
& Prof. Code § 17200.) “An unlawful business practice or act is an act or
practice, committed pursuant to business activity, that is at the same time
forbidden by law.” (Klein v. Earth Elements, Inc. (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th
965, 969.) A violation of other
laws is deemed independently actionable under the UCL. (Law Offices of
Mathew Higbee v. Expungement Assistance Services (2013) 214
Cal.App.4th 544, 554.) “‘Virtually any law—federal, state or local—can serve as
a predicate for a section 17200 action.’” (Id.)
 
To
bring a claim under the fraud prong, a plaintiff must allege an affirmative
misrepresentation, conduct, or business practice on the part of a defendant; or
an omission in violation of a defendant’s duty to disclose; and that is likely
to deceive members of the public. (Buller v. Sutter Health (2008) 160
Cal.App.4th 981, 986; Hypertouch, Inc. v. ValueClick, Inc. (2011) 192
Cal.App.4th 805, 839-840 [whether statements or advertisements are likely to
deceive a reasonable consumer, is a fact question].) The fraud prong of the UCL
is less rigorous than common law fraud, as common law fraud requires
allegations of actual falsity and reasonable reliance while fraud under UCL
does not. (Morgan v. AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th
1235, 1256.)
 
            Here,
the FAC alleges GM unlawfully violated the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.
(FAC ¶¶38-39; ¶¶47-86.) GM does not dispute that the FAC states a claim under
Song-Beverly. Thus, the FAC pleads the elements required for an “unlawful” UCL
claim. Moreover, the FAC establishes an omission in violation of GM’s duty to
disclose which is likely to deceive a member of the public. (FAC ¶¶ 8,
30.) 
 
Accordingly, the demurrer is OVERRULED
as to this cause of action.
 
Motion to Strike - Punitive Damages
 
The motion to strike is moot pursuant
to the demurrer ruling.
 
Plaintiff has 20 days to file an
amended complaint.
