 Case No.: 
  21STCV46199  
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  October 25, 2023 




 
Defendant’s motion for a
protective order is GRANTED. 
 
On
12/17/2023, Plaintiff T.K. (Plaintiff) filed suit against DOE 1, alleging: (1)
negligence and negligent hiring, retention, and supervision.
 
            Now,
Defendant moves to stay the deposition of LAUSD’s PMK and quash Plaintiff’s
Notice of Deposition for LAUSD’s PMK. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Defendant
argues that a protective order is necessary here because Plaintiff’s Deposition
Notice is overly broad and burdensome. Defendant also contends that it did not
waive its objections to the Second Amended Notice of Deposition, and if it did,
relief is warranted. 
 
            After
review, the Courts concludes that there has been no waiver, that relief would
be warranted if there had been waiver, and that the scope of the PMK Deposition
should be substantially narrowed. 
 
            As to the
issue of waiver, LAUSD served timely objections to the original PMK
Notice.  In addition to raising
objections based on overbreadth, LAUSD also objected to the unilaterally
noticed date of the deposition notice. After meet and confer, the deposition
was continued to the mutually agreed upon date of 7/24/2023. On July 13, 2023,
Plaintiff served a “Second Amended Notice of Taking Deposition of Person Most
Knowledgeable for the School District” that, aside from the date and time which
had been agreed to, was identical to her June 12, 2023 notice. LAUSD did not
resubmit the objections raised to the original Notice. 
 
            CCP section
2025.410 (a) states that a party “waives any error or irregularity” to a
deposition notice unless a written objection “specifying that error or
irregularity” is served “at least three calendar days prior to the date for
which the deposition is scheduled.” Here, LAUSD served an objection to
Plaintiff’s deposition notice which specified the errors and irregularities
with the deposition notice on June 23, 2023. LAUS did not waive any objections
to the deposition notice. While Plaintiff contends its “Second Amended Notice
of Taking Deposition of Person Most Knowledgeable from Los Angeles Unified
School District” required its own objection, that notice was identical to the
first notice, other than the date and time of the deposition, which at that
point had been mutually agreed to. The Court does not find waiver under the
circumstances.
 
            However,
even assuming there was waiver, the spirit of the Discovery Act does not reward
games of “gotcha” or a failure to meet and confer. Here, Plaintiff unilaterally
noticed a deposition without meeting and conferring with Defendant. The amended
notice was identical aside from the date and time. Accordingly, to conclude
that LAUSD has waived its right to properly raised objections would reward
Plaintiff’s unilateral conduct and failure to meet and confer. 
 
            Having
concluded there is no waiver, this leaves only the issue of whether or not
Plaintiff’s PMK categories are overly broad. The Court already noted at the
9/6/2023 IDC that it would be extremely unlikely it could ever find every
sexual abuse from day one to the present to be discoverable. Rather, the Court
found that a more appropriate scope was to limit the dates to 1970-1980, with
the exception that the alleged perpetrator William Alexander’s entire personnel
file is discoverable (his dates of employment were from 1970-2007). As such,
the Court adopts the following scope of the proposed categories:
 
-         
Category 1: General policies regarding responding to
reports of childhood sexual abuse from January 1, 1970 to December 31, 1979.
 
-         
Categories 2, 3, 6, 9, 10, and 11: General policies
regarding school safety as it pertains to childhood sexual abuse from January
1, 1970 to December 31, 1979.
 
-         
 Categories 4-5:
Any records of accusations of childhood sexual abuse made against William
Alexander, if any, from any time. 
 
-         
Categories 6, 7: General policies and/or practice
regarding background investigations conducted for teachers from January 1, 1970
to December 31, 1979. 
 
            Based on
the foregoing, Defendant’s motion for a protective order is granted, and the
scope of the PMK Deposition is narrowed accordingly.  
 
 
It is so ordered.

T.K
  
         vs.
 
DOE
  1 
  


 Case No.: 
  21STCV46199  
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  October 25, 2023 




            
 
Defendant’s
motion to compel is MOOT. Plaintiff is sanctioned, jointly and severally with
counsel, $2,700.00.   
 
On
12/17/2023, Plaintiff T.K. (Plaintiff) filed suit against DOE 1, alleging: (1)
negligence and negligent hiring, retention, and supervision.
 
Now,
Defendant moves to compel Plaintiff to comply with the Court-ordered mental
examination with Dr. James High. Defendant also requests monetary sanctions. 
 
Discussion
 
            Defendant
argues that Plaintiff failed to comply with the Court’s 7/21/2023 Order which
required Plaintiff to appear for her psychiatric evaluation by Dr. James High.
 
            In
opposition, Plaintiff indicates that she appeared for her Independent Medical Examination (IME) on September 7,
2023, thus making Defendant’s motion moot.
 
            However, after review, the Court still finds sanctions to
be warranted. 
 
Because
Plaintiff’s mental and psychological condition is in controversy in this
action, the parties entered into a stipulation for a psychiatric evaluation of
Plaintiff, and the Court signed the Order regarding the Stipulation. The
parties then mutually agreed to conduct the IME on July 19, 2023. On July 19,
2023, Plaintiff did not appear for the IME, and Dr. High charged a no-show fee
of $2,700.
 
            Notably, the parties already participated in an IDC over
Plaintiff’s non-appearance, and the Court was under the impression that the
issue had been informally resolved. However, Plaintiff still advanced an
opposition to this motion, in which Plaintiff argued that Defendant had
attempted to unilaterally change the terms of the Stipulation for the
psychiatric evaluation of Plaintiff, and thus should not be sanctioned for the
failure to appear. 
 
However,
the correspondence between the parties establishes that Defendant’s counsel
never indicated that the Stipulation would not be followed. Rather, Defense
counsel notified Plaintiff’s counsel, prior to the July 19, 2023 evaluation,
that Dr. High intended to conduct an additional test, the Personality
Assessment Inventory (PAI). The stipulation expressly provided that Dr. High
could select additional tests and if he determined they were needed, could
conduct such additional tests with notice to the parties. 
 
While
Plaintiff objected to the fact that no psychological testing had yet been
performed at the time of notice, it would not have been a violation of the
Stipulation for Plaintiff to appear and for Dr. High to have administered the
PAI and MMPI-3 based on his determination (and having provided notice). As
such, Plaintiff’s failure to appear was without substantial justification. 
 
Based
on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion to compel is moot. Plaintiff is
sanctioned, jointly and severally with counsel, $2,700.00. 
 
It is so ordered.
