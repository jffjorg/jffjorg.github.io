And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant's motion to transfer the action to San Mateo County. The plaintiff had filed a lawsuit against the defendant, alleging violations of Computer Fraud CPC section 501, breach of implied covenant, misrepresentations, and negligence. The defendant argued that the parties had agreed to try the dispute in San Mateo County and that the plaintiff had voluntarily agreed to the Instagram Terms of Use, which established San Mateo County as the exclusive jurisdiction for claims arising out of or related to Instagram. The court found that the forum selection clause was valid and enforceable, and that the transfer was mandatory. The court also rejected the plaintiff's arguments that the clause was part of an adhesion contract and that public policy did not favor the clause. The court concluded that the forum selection clause was aligned with public policy and that the transfer was reasonable.
