Summary: The judge has denied Defendant Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC's motion to compel binding arbitration. The Defendant argued that Plaintiff Cisco Adler agreed to arbitrate claims related to the condition of the vehicle through a Motor Vehicle Lease Agreement, and that the Defendant was entitled to enforce the arbitration provision as a nonsignatory. The judge found that the Plaintiff's claims were not intimately intertwined with the underlying contract, and that the Defendant could not invoke the arbitration provision under an equitable estoppel theory or as a third-party beneficiary.
