And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lemon law case involving Heriberto Aguilar and Jennifer Aguilar as plaintiffs and Ford Motor Company and WC Performance Ford as defendants. The defendants demurred to the complaint, alleging that the plaintiffs failed to state causes of action for fraudulent concealment and negligent repair. After reviewing the pleadings, the judge has decided to overrule the demurrer to the Fifth Cause of Action for fraudulent concealment and sustain the demurrer to the Sixth Cause of Action for negligent repair with 20 days' leave to amend. The judge found that the plaintiffs had alleged sufficient facts to state a cause of action for fraudulent concealment, but the complaint failed to allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action for negligent repair. The judge also ruled that the economic loss rule bars the negligent repair claim.
