And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Sammy's Café Mexican Food and Carlos Entertainment, Inc. (Sammy's Café) to the Fourth and Fifth causes of action in the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Plaintiff Saul Vanegas.

The Court finds that Sammy's Café's demurrer is based on an incorrect assumption that Plaintiff was an employee and therefore has no claim against the defendants. However, the Court notes that Plaintiff has alleged that he worked "under the table" for CulichiTown Management Group, Inc. (CulichiTown), which is defined as "covert and usually unlawful." Therefore, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has not only alleged that he was an employee, but that the employment was covert and possibly unlawful.

The Court further finds that there is no showing that the worker's compensation policy mentioned in the FAC would apply to Plaintiff due to his status as an "under the table" employee. Therefore, the Court overrules Sammy's Café's demurrer and allows the Fourth and Fifth causes of action in the FAC to proceed.

In conclusion, the Court has issued a tentative ruling that overrules Sammy's Café's demurrer and allows the Fourth and Fifth causes of action in the FAC to proceed.
