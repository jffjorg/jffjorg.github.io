MOTIONS
            Defendant
Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“Defendant”) moves to
deem admitted matters specified in Requests for Admissions, set one (“RFA”),
which Defendant served on Plaintiff Alireza Kehanpour (“Plaintiff”).  Plaintiff has not opposed the motion.
ANALYSIS
When a party fails
to respond to requests for admissions, the propounding party may move for an order that the genuineness of any
documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. 
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The Court “shall” grant a motion to
deem admitted the matters specified in the requests for admissions, “unless it
finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)  
Defendant served
the RFA on Plaintiff on July 10, 2024 by mail. 
Plaintiff’s responses were thus due by August 14, 2024.  As of the filing date of the motion,
Plaintiff had not responded to the RFA.  Therefore,
the Court grants the motion to deem admitted matters specified in the RFA. 
Defendant is ordered to provide notice of
this order and to file proof of service of same.
