MOTION
Defendant Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Defendant”) filed a motion for summary judgment, which the
Court granted in its order of November 25, 2024.  Defendant moves to seal exhibits Defendant
lodged in support of its motion. 
Plaintiff has not opposed the motion. 

ANALYSIS
Civil court
proceedings are presumptively open to the public. (Richmond Newspapers, Inc.
v. Virginia (1980) 448 U.S. 555, 580, fn. 17.)  Before sealing records, “a trial court must
hold a hearing and expressly find that (i) there exists an overriding interest
supporting closure and/or sealing; (ii) there is a substantial probability that
the interest will be prejudiced absent closure and/or sealing; (iii) the
proposed closure and/or sealing is narrowly tailored to serve the overriding
interest; and (iv) there is no less restrictive means of achieving the
overriding interest.” (NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court
(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1217-1218.)
Defendant’s
sealing request is narrowly tailored to identifying information of Plaintiff,
who filed this lawsuit anonymously, and the identifying information of clients
of Defendant who are not parties to this lawsuit.  The Court finds sealing is necessary to
support Plaintiff’s overriding interest in her personal identifying information
and Defendant’s interest in maintaining its clients’ confidences.  Accordingly, the
motion to seal is granted in keeping with the Proposed Order Defendant filed concurrently
with the motion. 
Defendant is ordered
to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
