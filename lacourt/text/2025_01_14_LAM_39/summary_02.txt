And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion to deem admitted matters specified in Requests for Admissions, which were served on the plaintiff by the defendant. The plaintiff did not respond to the requests, and the defendant is seeking an order deeming the matters admitted. The law requires that the court grant this motion unless the plaintiff serves a proposed response to the requests before the hearing on the motion, and the proposed response is in substantial compliance with the law. Since the plaintiff did not respond, the court grants the motion and orders the defendant to provide notice of the order and to file proof of service.
