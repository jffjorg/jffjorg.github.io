BACKGROUND
             On July 21, 2023, Plaintiffs Greisyle Parada
and Bryan Andrew Carrillo filed a complaint for violations of the Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act against Hyundai Motor America.  Plaintiffs alleged causes of action for: (1)
violation of Civil Code §1793.2(d); (2) violation of Civil Code §1793.2(b); (3)
violation of Civil Code §1793.2(a)(3); (4) violation of breach of express
warranty (Civil Code §1791.2(a); 1794); and (5) breach of the implied warranty
of merchantability (Civil Code §§1791.1 and 1794).
 
On
May 29, 2024, this Court entered an order (the “Order”) on Plaintiffs’ Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Plaintiffs’ Request for Production of Documents,
Set One and Request for Sanctions (the “Motion to Compel”).  On June 7, 2024, Defendant filed a Motion for
Reconsideration of the Order (the “Motion for Reconsideration”).  Defendant asserted as a ground for the Motion
for Reconsideration that it was not served with the Motion to Compel.  Plaintiffs filed an opposition to the Motion
on July 8, 2024.
 
DISCUSSION
“When
an application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and
refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms,
any party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the
party of written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different
facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that
made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior
order. The party making the application shall state by affidavit what
application was made before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions
were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed
to be shown. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008(a).) 

 
The Court initially notes that a proof of
service is in evidence that states that Defendant’s attorneys were served.  A
proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that service was proper.  (American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara
(2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390.)  The
presumption only arises if the proof of service complies with the statutory
requirements regarding such proofs.  (Dill,
supra, 24 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1441-1442.)  Proof of service of summons may be impeached
by evidence that contradicts it. (City of Los Angeles v. Morgan (1951)
105 Cal.App.2d 726, 731.) 
 
Based on the facts presented, the Court finds the
proof of service presented by Plaintiffs create the presumption that
Defendant’s counsel was properly served with the Motion to Compel, such that
the Court finds that no valid evidence establishes any new evidence to support
a motion for reconsideration based upon CCP Section 1008(a), and on that ground
the motion for reconsideration is DENIED.
 
When
a motion for reconsideration is not in itself warranted under the statute,
however, even absent a change in the law or new facts, the court has the inherent
power to reconsider its own interim orders at any time on its own motion.  (Le Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th
1094, 1107;  Nieto v. Blue Shield of
Calif. Life & Health Ins. Co. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 60, 73.) Here, the
Court finds that it is in the interest of justice for the Order to be vacated,
since officers of the Court have attested under penalty of perjury that they
did not receive the service copies of the Motion.  Therefore, the Court, on its own motion,
vacates the Order and sets a new hearing on the Motion to Compel for August 20,
2024 at 8:30 am.  Any opposition to the
Motion to Compel is due to be filed and served on or before August 2, 2024 and
any reply is due on or before August 9, 2024. 

 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
