And here is a summary in English text:

The Tentative Ruling is a summary of the judge's thinking based on the information presented to date. The case, 23STCV25326, involves Patrick Molloy and others (Plaintiffs) suing Carey Hellman and others (Defendants) for various claims related to a construction project. The Plaintiffs allege that Hellman, as the contractor, was not properly licensed during the project and that his subcontractors were also not licensed. The Defendants, Hellman and his company Hellman Associates, dispute these allegations.

The judge has reviewed the moving, opposition, and reply papers and has considered the facts presented. The judge finds that the evidence shows that Hellman's contractor's license with the Contractor's State License Board (CSLB) was inactive or had lapsed during the project, and that the subcontractors hired by Hellman were also not licensed. The judge rejects the Defendants' claims that they were properly licensed throughout the project.

As a result, the judge has ruled on the Defendants' demurrer (a legal challenge to the validity of the Plaintiffs' claims) and has found that the Plaintiffs have a valid cause of action for breach of implied-in-fact contract, negligence, breach of implied warranty, disgorgement, unfair business practices, and fraud. The judge has overruled the Defendants' demurrer to the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Causes of Action.
