BACKGROUND
This
is an action arising from allegedly uninhabitable conditions in four adjacent
apartment buildings located at 4018 Gelber Place, Los Angeles, CA 90008
(“4018”), 4024 Gelber Place, Los Angeles, CA 90008 (“4024”), 4029 Gelber Place,
Los Angeles, CA 90008 (“4029”), and 4036 Gelber Place, Los Angeles, CA 90008 (“4036”)
(referred to sometimes collectively in the SAC as the “Property”).  On August 30, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the
operative Second Amended Complaint (the “SAC”) against, among others,
Defendants Crawford, Apts, Gelber and Expo (sometimes collectively, the
“Crawford Defendants”) alleging causes of action for: (1) negligence; (2)
breach of implied warranty of habitability;
(3) breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment; (4) nuisance; (5) premises
liability; (6) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (7) negligent
infliction of emotional distress; (8) violation of Civil Code §1942.4; (9)
constructive eviction and willful interruption of services; (10) retaliation;
(11) harassment; (12) violation of unfair competition laws; (13) violation of
tenant anti-harassment ordinance; (14) violation of Civil Code §1940.3(b); (15)
violation of Fair Employment and Housing Act; (16) violation of Unruh Civil
Rights Act; (17) violation of disabled persons act; (18) intentional
misrepresentation; (19) negligent misrepresentation; and (20) breach of implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  Only the first through twelfth and twentieth
causes of action are directed to the Crawford Defendants. 
 
The
Crawford Defendants filed a demurrer to the SAC pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure (“CCP”) § 430.10(d), on the ground that they have been improperly
joined in this action. 
 
MEET
AND CONFER
The
meet and confer requirement has been met. 
 


 
DISCUSSION
            “A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter
of law.”  (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)
“[T]he court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation, and treats the
demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded.”  (Id.)  “The court accepts as true all material
factual allegations, giving them a liberal construction, but it does not
consider conclusions of fact or law, opinions, speculation, or allegations
contrary to law or judicially noticed facts.” 
(Shea Homes Limited Partnership v.
County of Alameda (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1246, 1254.)  In the demurrer context a court “may also
take notice of exhibits attached to the complain[t].”  (Holland
v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447.)  “If facts appearing in the exhibits contradict
those alleged, the facts in the exhibits take precedence.”  (Id.)
 
A
party against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been filed may file a
special demurrer on the ground that there is a defect or misjoinder of parties.
(Code of Civil Procedure § 430.10(d); Union Carbide Corp. v. Superior Court
(1977) 36 Cal. 3d 15, 21-22.) This defect must appear on the fact of the
complaint or in matters judicially noticed. (Royal Surplus Lines Ins. Co.,
Inc. v. Ranger Ins. Co. (2002) 100 Cal. App. 4th 193, 198.) Pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure § 389, “defect” means a necessary or indispensable
party is absent from the action. Whereas, “misjoinder” states that a party has
been improperly joined to an action.
 
CCP
§ 379(a)(1) provides:
(a)
All persons may be joined in one action as defendants if there is asserted
against them:
(1)
any right to relief jointly, severally, or in the alternative, in respect of or
arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or
occurrences and if any question of law or fact common to all persons will arise
in the action; or
(2)
a claim, right, or interest adverse to them in the property or controversy
which is the subject of the action.
 
Special
Demurrer for Misjoinder Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 430.10(d)
             The Crawford
Defendants specially demur to the SAC on the ground that they have been
improperly joined in this action as there are no common questions of law or
fact arising out of the same transaction or events for all of the named
defendants. 
 
            Initially, the Court notes that although 4018, 4024, 4029
and 4036 are all referred to in the SAC collectively as “the Property,” they are
in fact separate apartment buildings. (SAC ¶ 4.)  Plaintiffs in fact allege that only Defendant
Expo held title to 4018 and 4024, and then only from February 2012 to November
2017.  (SAC ¶ 83.)  Defendant Gelber is alleged to have held
title to 4029 and 4036 from February 2014 until in and about November 2017.
(SAC ¶ 84.)  
 
            One of the reasons why the allegations directed to “the
Property” in the SAC are indicative of improper joinder is that although there
are numerous allegations that recite deficiencies in “the Property,” the vast
majority of these allegations relate to a single apartment building, namely 4029.  Allegations regarding 4029 are reflected
(often relating to multiple issues) in Paragraphs 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117,
118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133,
134, 135, 138, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 149, 150 and 151.  These alleged violations are serious and
continuous from 2010 to 2023.  In
contrast, the only violations listed with regard to 4018 are a citation in 2016
relating to the laundry room (SAC ¶ 139) and improper mesh size on vent screens
in 2019 (SAC ¶ 147) and with regard to 4024 a violation in June 2014 for
failure to properly install or maintain required lighting fixtures and failure
to maintain the plumbing system free from defective, damaged, leaking faucets
or plumbing fixtures.  (SAC ¶ 143.)  Another violation was issued on 4024 for
improper mesh size in 2019 and another notice was issued on May 17, 2022. (SAC
¶ 151.)  All of the cited violations at 4018
and 4024 occurred after the Crawford Defendants ceased to own any of the
buildings.  No violations are referenced
in the SAC relating to 4036.  
 
            Apart from the issue of the joinder of claims relating to
the four buildings, which apparently had wildly disparate histories with regard
to their state of disrepair, the very captions of the twenty causes of action
demonstrate a problem with joinder.  In
all of the causes of action alleged against the Crawford Defendants, each
single cause of action recites three separate sets of Plaintiffs and three separate
sets of Defendants.  For example, in the
initial cause of action, the caption reads:
                                                FIRST

            Here, a single cause of action purports to address
different claims by different groups of plaintiffs against different groups of
defendants.  This manner of pleading fails
to give adequate notice of what claims are being brought against what
defendants by what plaintiffs.  It is
clear from the captions alone that these are not properly pleaded claims.
 
 
“Although
modern joinder statutes are to be liberally construed and applied, neither the
statutes nor the case law in California permit unlimited joinder.” (Hoag v.
Sup. Ct. (1962) 207 Cal. App. 2d 611, 618.) Where there has been no showing
that different defendants operated cooperatively to cause the injury, a
plaintiff has not established that defendants are jointly and severally liable.
(Id.) In Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Adams (1985) 170 Cal. App. 3d
712 (disapproved on other grounds by Garvey v. State Farm Fire &
Casualty Co. (1989) 48 Cal. 3d 395), an insurance company sued numerous
homeowner policy holders for declaratory relief seeking a judicial declaration
that the policy did not provide coverage for damages arising from a single
storm. The court held there was a misjoinder of parties even though the same
storm played a role in each claim. The court stated that while it may be
possible to join certain of the defendants together under a more specific factual
allegations, it was improper to label damages herein to innumerable types of
structures occurring at widely separate locations across the state, resulting
from a myriad of causes and under various conditions as the same transaction or
occurrence. (Id. at 723.)
 
            Here, Plaintiffs have alleged that, during the relevant
time period, several different individuals and entities as defendants have had ownership
and/or management interests in “the 
Property”. (SAC ¶¶ 4-5, 74-104.) Effectively, these defendants are
alleged to have failed to maintain the Subject Properties in a habitable
condition and were aware of the unsafe and unsanitary conditions present at the
apartment buildings. (Id. at ¶¶ 2-3, 5-6.) As to the Crawford
Defendants, they are only alleged to have had an interest in the Subject
Properties to varying degrees between February 2012 to November 2017. (Id. at
¶¶ 83-92.) The only allegation linking the Crawford Defendants with the
remaining defendants is an allegation that each defendant was an agent of the
other defendants during the relevant periods of time (Id. at ¶ 104.) There
are no allegations to suggest that the Crawford Defendants’ ownership or
management of the various apartment buildings constituting the “Property”
overlapped with those of the remaining defendants. 
 
            Plaintiffs argue that the Crawford Defendants have a
common interest in all four of the properties based on the overlap of ownership
and management of the four buildings. 
(Opposition, p.2.)  While the
allegations within the SAC suggest that there is a common issue regarding the
purported mismanagement and uninhabitable conditions of the four buildings, the
SAC fails to show how the Crawford Defendants “operated cooperatively” with the
remaining defendants to cause Plaintiffs’ injuries. (Hoag, supra, 207
Cal. App. 2d at 618.) Moreover, while the SAC alleges that all defendants were
agents of the other, this conclusory allegation is undermined by the fact that
the Crawford Defendants’ ownership or management of the Subject Properties did
not overlap with that of the remaining defendants. Thus, as alleged, any
conduct of the Crawford Defendants relating to the “Property” cannot be imputed
to the remaining defendants and vice versa. As a result, any harm that the
Plaintiffs suffered by the Crawford Defendants’ mismanagement is unrelated to
the harm purportedly caused by the remaining defendants. Therefore, the
Crawford Defendants have been improperly joined in this action and any viable
claim should be made in a separate lawsuit against them. 
 
            Plaintiffs argue that the Crawford Defendants have failed
to show that they suffered any prejudice for being improperly joined in this
action. (Opposition at pp. 7-8.) 
Plaintiffs also suggest that they would suffer prejudice should the
Court sustain the Crawford Defendants’ Demurrer. (Opposition, Section III D.)  The problem is that the entanglement of the
four buildings, the sixty-plus plaintiffs – who lived in different buildings at
different times -- and the nineteen defendants – who allegedly had different
roles at different times in connection with the four buildings -- render the
litigation of this case in one case.  
 
            Accordingly, the Court sustains the instant demurrer because
the Crawford Defendants have been improperly joined in this action.
 
Leave to Amend
“Where the defect raised
by … demurrer is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and
liberally granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in
question.” (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120
Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.) Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a
reasonable possibility of successful amendment. 
(See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is
on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended
successfully. (Id.)
 
Plaintiffs request that the Court grant leave to
amend in order to cure the defect found in the SAC. (Opposition at pp.-7-8.)  Defendants request that the Demurrer be sustained
without leave to amend because Plaintiffs have had three opportunities to allege
a valid claim against them and have not demonstrated that they are able to do
so.  
 
This is not a situation where there may or may not
be a valid claim alleged against the defendants; this situation involves what
may be a valid claim that has improperly joined claims and defendants in one single
complaint.  Because Plaintiffs are not at
fault for the decision to plead this matter as one case, the Court will grant
Plaintiffs one more chance to plead a case that does not misjoin defendants and
claims – perhaps by severing these claims into different cases.  
            
The
Demurrer is SUSTAINED with twenty days leave to amend.  The Crawford Defendants are ordered to give
notice of this ruling.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
