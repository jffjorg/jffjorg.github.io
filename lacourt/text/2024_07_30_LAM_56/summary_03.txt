And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is regarding a demurrer filed by the Crawford Defendants, Mark Crawford, Mary Crawford, Apts Managements LLC, Gelber Apts, LLC, and Expo Apts, LLC, to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) filed by the Plaintiffs, Denise Doris, et al. The SAC alleges various causes of action against the defendants, including negligence, breach of implied warranty of habitability, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, among others.

The court has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers and has determined that the Crawford Defendants have been improperly joined in the action. The court finds that the SAC fails to show how the Crawford Defendants "operated cooperatively" with the remaining defendants to cause the Plaintiffs' injuries. The court also notes that the SAC alleges that all defendants were agents of the other, but this conclusory allegation is undermined by the fact that the Crawford Defendants' ownership or management of the Subject Properties did not overlap with that of the remaining defendants.

The court sustains the demurrer with twenty days leave to amend, granting the Plaintiffs one more chance to plead a case that does not misjoin defendants and claims. The court orders the Crawford Defendants to give notice of this ruling.
