And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion for reconsideration of an order granting a motion to compel further responses to a request for production of documents. The defendant, Hyundai Motor America, moved for reconsideration, alleging that it was not served with the motion to compel. The court found that the proof of service presented by the plaintiffs creates a presumption that the defendant's counsel was properly served with the motion to compel, and therefore denied the motion for reconsideration. However, the court also found that it was in the interest of justice to vacate the original order and set a new hearing on the motion to compel, due to the fact that officers of the court attest under penalty of perjury that they did not receive the service copies of the motion. The new hearing is set for August 20, 2024 at 8:30 am.
