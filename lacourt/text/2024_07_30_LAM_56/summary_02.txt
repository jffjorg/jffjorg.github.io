And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by Plaintiffs to amend their complaint to include new allegations of defects in a Hyundai automobile. The accident occurred on May 13, 2021, and the Plaintiffs obtained new evidence through discovery responses and test results. The new evidence relates to a condition known as "brake pedal drift." The Judge has granted the motion, finding that the Plaintiffs have provided sufficient credible evidence to support the amendment. The Judge orders the Plaintiffs to file the amended complaint within five court days. If the amended complaint is filed, it will become the operative pleading in the case, and the currently scheduled motion for summary judgment will be moot.
