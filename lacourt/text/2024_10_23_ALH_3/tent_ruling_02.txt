Salar
 Hendizadeh seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for plaintiff
 Jamice Quick (“Plaintiff”) on grounds that there has been
 an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should
be granted. (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) 
Counsel’s Motion complies with
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362. The Court notes that trial in this
matter is not yet set and no prejudice will result from granting this motion.
Accordingly, this unopposed motion to be relieved is GRANTED and effective upon
filing a proof of service showing service of this Order on Plaintiff.
Moving party to give notice.
 
Dated
this 23rd
day of October 2024
