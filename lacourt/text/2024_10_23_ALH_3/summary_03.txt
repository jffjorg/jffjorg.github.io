Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Ford Motor Company's motion to transfer the case to Imperial County. The case was filed by Jose Carmen Lopez, who alleges that Ford failed to repair his 2019 Ford Fusion. Ford argues that the proper venue for the case is Imperial County because Lopez purchased the vehicle in El Centro, California, and the warranty repairs were performed by El Centro Motors. The judge found that Ford had submitted sufficient evidence to support the transfer, including records showing that the vehicle was invoiced to El Centro Motors and that all warranty repairs were performed by that location. As a result, the judge ordered the case to be transferred to Imperial County and required Lopez to pay all applicable costs and fees.
