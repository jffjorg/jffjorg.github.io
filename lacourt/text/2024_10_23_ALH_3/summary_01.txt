And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Gary Smith (plaintiff) vs. General Motors LLC (defendant). The plaintiff has filed a motion to compel further discovery responses to special interrogatories, while the defendant has filed objections to those same interrogatories. The judge has found that the defendant has not provided sufficient responses to the special interrogatories, particularly with respect to identifying key witnesses and providing information about warranty policies. The judge has ordered the defendant to serve further responses within 20 days of the ruling, which includes providing the identities of individuals involved in warranty repairs, inspections, and investigations. The judge has also denied the defendant's request for sanctions, as the plaintiff did not request them.
