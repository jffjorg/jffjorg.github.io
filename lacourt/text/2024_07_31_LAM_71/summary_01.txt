Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion of BMI Group, Inc. and its co-defendants (Mike Agazaryan, David Agazaryan, and Ara Baljian) to bifurcate the trial and hold a bench trial on the issue of contract interpretation. The moving defendants argued that a bench trial would promote judicial economy and efficiency, as well as convenience to the prospective jurors, since the issues in the case revolve around the terms of the Binding Letter of Intent Re: Joint Venture for the operation of licensed commercial cannabis businesses in Lompoc, California. However, the judge has determined that the credibility of extrinsic evidence is crucial in determining the parties' obligations under the LOI, and therefore, a jury trial is necessary to resolve the factual conflict. The judge has scheduled the trial for October 7, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., and a Final Status Conference for September 26, 2024, at 9:30 a.m.
