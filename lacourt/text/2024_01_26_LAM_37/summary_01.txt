And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Defendant's Motion to Strike the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by the Plaintiff. The Defendant moves to strike certain paragraphs of the FAC alleging punitive damages, and the Plaintiff opposes the motion. The judge grants the Defendant's motion, striking the paragraphs alleging punitive damages. The Plaintiff is granted 10 days leave to amend the FAC, and a Non-Appearance OSC re Amended Complaint is set for February 23, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The Case Management Conference is continued to March 28, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The judge finds that the FAC fails to allege facts showing malice, oppression, or fraud, and that the Defendant's failure to fix the plumbing issues is not sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages.
