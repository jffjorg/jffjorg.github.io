And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a dispute between the Cohens and the Kaplans regarding property in Malibu. The Kaplans' Third Amended Cross-Complaint alleges that the Cohens agreed to a settlement that included an easement, but later reneged on the agreement. The Cohens argue that a settlement agreement was never formed, as Elaine Cohen did not sign the agreement.

The Judge has sustained the Cohens' demurrer to the third cause of action for breach of a settlement agreement, as the settlement agreement does not contain Elaine Cohen's signature. However, the Judge has also given the Kaplans leave to amend their complaint to allege that Paul Cohen executed the agreement as Elaine Cohen's agent.

The Judge has also sustained the Cohens' motion to strike portions of the cross-complaint that relate to mediation and settlement negotiations, as these communications are confidential and inadmissible.

The Judge has denied the Kaplans' request for sanctions against Paul Cohen and his former counsel Bloch for falsely representing that Elaine Cohen signed the settlement agreement. However, the Judge has granted the Kaplans' motion for sanctions against the Cohens and Bloch under CCP 128.5(b)(2) for their actions in bad faith. The Judge has ordered the Cohens and Bloch to pay the Kaplans' reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred as a result of their actions.
