And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is in favor of the defendants, Jerry Kohen, Orit Kohen, and Adir Haroni, on their motion for summary judgment and/or summary adjudication. The court holds that the doctrine of laches (unreasonable delay) bars the plaintiff, Daniella and Yaakov Wolf, from bringing their claim for quiet title and declaratory relief. The court finds that the Wolfs delayed for nearly two decades in bringing their claim, causing substantial prejudice to the defendants. The court also denies the Wolfs' motion for summary judgment on their countermotion, finding that the evidence presented by the defendants is sufficient to support their claims.

The court also rules on the issue of estoppel, finding that the defendants are not estopped from enforcing the note and deed of trust because the Wolfs did not repudiate the debt or the deed of trust until the lawsuit was filed. The court concludes that the Wolfs' delay was unreasonable and resulted in actual prejudice.

The tentative ruling is subject to change pending the hearing on March 12, 2024.
