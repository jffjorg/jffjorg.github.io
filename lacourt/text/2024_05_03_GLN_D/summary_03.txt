Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to compel compliance with a subpoena for production of business records from Chester Litvin, Ph.D. The defendants, Procare Transportation, Inc. and Nairi Hunanyan, had sought to compel Litvin to produce records related to the care and treatment of plaintiff Olga Miroshnikova. However, the defendants failed to show that the subpoena was personally served on Litvin, and therefore, the court was unable to determine that personal jurisdiction was obtained over Litvin or that Litvin failed to comply with the subpoena. The court also noted that the defendants did not provide proof of service or demonstrate that Litvin was served with the subpoena. As a result, the motion was denied without prejudice. The court also denied the request for sanctions and forfeiture. The parties are ordered to meet and confer in good faith prior to the filing of any further motion on this issue.
