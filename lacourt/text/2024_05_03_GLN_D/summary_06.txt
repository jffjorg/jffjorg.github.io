The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion for order evidencing assignment of judgment by operation of law is denied without prejudice. The plaintiff, American Express Centurion Bank, seeks an order evidencing the assignment of the judgment to American Express National Bank. The plaintiff argues that the two entities merged effective April 1, 2018, and that it intends to enforce the judgment under its true and current name of American Express National Bank. However, the court finds that the plaintiff has not properly submitted the required documentation for assignment of the judgment. The court also finds that the plaintiff's motion is deficient in several respects, including the failure to submit a properly authenticated acknowledgment of assignment of judgment. The court further finds that the plaintiff's attempt to amend its pleading to reflect its current name is also denied.
