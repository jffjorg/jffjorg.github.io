```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court denies the petition for approval of transfer of structured settlement payment rights without prejudice due to several procedural irregularities. The petitioner failed to provide notice of the continuance of the hearing date and failed to file proof of service of such notice. The petition also lacks several required documents, including the annuity contract and settlement agreement. The court cannot confirm that the annuity holder has been properly served and does not object to the transfer, which is required to overcome the enforcement of a contractual provision prohibiting assignment. The court dismissed the petition without prejudice and continued the hearing date.
