The court rules on plaintiff Seran
Ng, D.M.D. Inc.’s objections to the evidence filed by defendant Yang Lu in
connection with the motion to compel further discovery responses, filed on
April 26, 2024, as follows:
Objections Nos. 1, 8, and 10-12 are overruled. 
Objections Nos. 2-7, and 9 are sustained. 
MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER
Defendant Yang Lu
(“Defendant”) requests that the court issue a protective order that   (1) Defendant need not respond to the
newly-served discovery responses served on her by plaintiff Seran Ng,
D.M.D. Inc. (“Plaintiff”), and (2) Defendant need not sit for additional
testimony above the seven hours already provided.  (Mot., p. 9:18-21.)  Defendant also appears to request monetary
sanctions against Plaintiff.  (Mot., pp. 2:23-24,
9:12-15.) 
The court denies Defendant’s
motion because Defendant did not (1) file a notice of motion, and (2) submit a
meet and confer declaration that satisfies Code of Civil Procedure section
2016.040. 
First, the court finds that Defendant
did not file a notice of motion stating (1) “when, and the grounds upon which [the
motion] will be made, and the papers, if any, upon which it is to be based[,]”
or (2) “the nature of the order being sought and the grounds for issuance of
the order” as required.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1010; Cal. Rules of Ct., rules 3.1110, subd. (a), 3.1112, subd. (a)(1)
[“the papers filed in support of a motion must consist of at least the
following:[ ¶] (1) A notice of hearing on the motion”].)  Moreover, Defendant’s motion does not clearly
set forth the discovery requests that are the subject of her request for a
protective order.  For example, while Defendant
appears to take issue with the number of discovery requests propounded on her,
she has not identified which sets of discovery that she contends she should not
have to answer.  (Mot., pp. 3:5-6
[stating that Plaintiff served 12 sets of special interrogatories and 11 sets
of document demands], 7:23 [stating that Plaintiff served 113 requests for
admission].)  Instead, Defendant has only
generally requested that the court issue a protective order to protect her from
“responding to Plaintiff’s newly-served discovery requests[.]”  (Mot., p. 9:18-21.) 
Thus, the court finds that
Defendant has not provided Plaintiff with sufficient notice of the nature of
the order sought by failing to file a notice of motion that sets forth all of
the information required by statute.[1] 
Second, even if Defendant had
filed a notice of motion specifying the relief sought, the court finds that
Defendant did not submit a meet and confer declaration satisfying Code of Civil
Procedure section 2016.040.
A motion for a protective
order must be “accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.090, subd. (a) [motion for a protective order after interrogatories have
been propounded], 2031.060, subd. (a) [motion for a protective order after
documents have been demanded], 2033.080, subd. (a) [motion for a protective
order after requests for admission have been propounded], 2025.420, subd. (a)
[motion for a protective order made before, during, or after a deposition].)  “A meet and confer declaration in support of a
motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)
Defendant has submitted a
letter dated November 22, 2023, in which Defendant’s counsel (1) asked that
Plaintiff “cease all discovery requests, all motions to compel or further
compel, and motion for further deposition[;]” (2) advised Plaintiff’s counsel
that if Plaintiff did not agree to do so, Defendant would “be forced to seek
the court’s intervention in this matter[;]” (3) stated that, due to Plaintiff’s
harassment, Defendant “must now seek a protective order in this matter[;]” and
(4) stated that counsel was “meeting and conferring” on this matter, with the
hope that Plaintiff would “reconsider [its] position[,]” but advising
Plaintiff’s counsel that if Plaintiff did not cease its harassment of
Defendant, Defendant would “file the attached motion for a protective order.”  (Stone Decl., Ex. B, pp. 1-2.)  The court finds that this letter does not
reflect a “reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each
issue presented by” Defendant’s motion. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.) 
Instead, this communication does little more than advise Plaintiff’s
counsel of (1) Defendant’s position that Plaintiff’s conduct is harassing, and
(2) Defendant’s intent to file the pending motion for a protective order. 
Thus, the court finds that
Defendant did not submit a meet and confer declaration showing a reasonable and
good faith attempt to informally resolve each issue presented by the pending
motion for a protective order.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)  
For the reasons set forth
above, the court denies Defendant’s motion.
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO
REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION
Plaintiff moves the court for an order (1) compelling Defendant to
serve further responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission, Set Nine,
numbers 106-113, and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and
against Defendant in the amount of $5,261.65.[2]
The court finds that Defendant has not shown, for the reasons set
forth above, that the court should issue a protective order directing that
Defendant need not answer the subject requests for admission on the ground that
Plaintiff propounded more than 35 discovery requests.  (Opp., pp. 6:9-13, 8:15-21.)  The court therefore rules on the merits of
Plaintiff’s motion to compel her further responses to this discovery. 
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Requests for Admission, Set Nine, numbers 106-113 because Defendant’s
objections to those requests are without merit. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (a)(2).) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against
Defendant.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290,
subd. (d).)  The court finds that $1,861.65
((4.5 hours x $400 hourly rate) + $61.65 motion filing fees) is a reasonable
amount of sanctions to impose against Defendant in connection with this
motion.  (Chan Decl., ¶¶ 24-25.) 
The court denies Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.290, subd. (d).) 
ORDER
            The court denies defendant Yang Lu’s
motion for protective order. 
The court grants plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D. Inc.’s motion to compel
further responses to requests for admission. 
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2033.290, the court orders defendant Yang Lu to serve further, full and
complete responses to plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D. Inc.’s Requests for Admission,
Set Nine, numbers 106-113, that comply with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2033.210-2033.240,
within 20 days of the date of service of this order. 
            The court orders defendant Yang Lu
to pay monetary sanctions to plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D. Inc. in the amount of $1,861.65
within 30 days of the date of service of this order. 
            The court orders plaintiff Seran Ng,
D.M.D. Inc.  to give notice of this
ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
