And here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding the upcoming hearing on the motion for protective order and the request for monetary sanctions. The defendant appears to have requested monetary sanctions against the plaintiff, but failed to file a notice of motion as required by Code Civ. Proc., ยง 2023.040. As a result, the court will not consider the request for sanctions. The court did, however, continue the hearing on the motion for protective order to May 3, 2024, and will hear it on the same date as the defendant's motion for a protective order.
