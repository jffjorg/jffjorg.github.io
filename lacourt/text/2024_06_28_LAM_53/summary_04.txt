And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint and the motion to strike portions of the complaint. The court overrules the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint as to all causes of action except the fourth and eighth causes of action, which are sustained. The court also grants the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages and the supporting allegations.

The court finds that the allegations in the First Amended Complaint are sufficient to establish causes of action for breach of the implied warranty of habitability and covenant of quiet enjoyment. However, the court finds that the allegations are insufficient to establish causes of action for breach of contract and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

The court also finds that Essex Property Trust is a landlord or owner of the subject property, or may be held liable as an alter ego of the landlord. The court grants the plaintiff 20 days to file a Second Amended Complaint that cures the deficiencies in the ruling.

The court orders that the prayer for punitive damages and the supporting allegations be stricken from the First Amended Complaint. The court also orders the defendants to give notice of this ruling.
