And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions: Defendant Yang Lu's motion for a protective order and Plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc.'s motion to compel further responses to requests for admission. The judge denied Defendant's motion for a protective order because Defendant did not file a notice of motion with the court and did not submit a meet and confer declaration showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion. The judge also denied Defendant's request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff.

The judge granted Plaintiff's motion to compel Defendant to serve further responses to requests for admission, Set Nine, numbers 106-113, because Defendant's objections to those requests are without merit. The judge also awarded Plaintiff monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,861.65 against Defendant for failing to comply with discovery requests.
