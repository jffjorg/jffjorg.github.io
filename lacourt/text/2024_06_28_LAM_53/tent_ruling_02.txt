The court also notes that Defendant appears to have requested that the court
award monetary sanctions in her favor and against Plaintiff.  (Mot., p. 9:13-15.)  However, “[a] request for a sanction shall, in
the notice of motion, identify every person, party, and attorney against
whom the sanction is sought, and specify the type of sanction sought.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.040 [emphasis added].)  As set forth above, Defendant did not file a
notice of motion. 


[2] On
May 3, 2024, the court issued an order (1) noting that Defendant filed the
motion for protective order discussed above, and (2) exercising its discretion
to continue the hearing on this motion, so that it could be heard on the same
date as Defendant’s motion for a protective order.  (May 3, 2024 Order, pp. 1:22-25, 2:1-3.)
