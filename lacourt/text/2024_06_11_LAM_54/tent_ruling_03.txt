The Court considers the moving

received.  
 
Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made may petition
the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.  (CCP § 1285.) 
Petitioner has complied with CCP § 1285.4 as Petitioner has set forth
the name of the arbitrator, attached documents evidencing an agreement to
arbitrate and attached a copy of the arbitration award. Respondents were served
with the petition by personal service and notice and acknowledgment and receipt.
 
The court file reflects that respondents
do not oppose to the petition.  (See
CCP § 1290.6 [“A response shall be served and filed within 10 days after
service of the petition”].)  As
Respondents do not oppose, the allegations of the petition are deemed admitted
by Respondents.  (CCP § 1290.) The
petition is GRANTED.
