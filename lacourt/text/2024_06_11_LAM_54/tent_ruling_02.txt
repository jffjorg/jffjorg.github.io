PETITIONER TO NOTICE.

day of the hearing. 
 
The Court considers the moving papers,
opposition, and reply.
 
A. Entitlement to Attorney’s Fees
 
Under CCP § 1021.5, attorneys’ fees may
be awarded (1) “to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in
any action which” (2) “has resulted in the enforcement of an important right
affecting the public interest if” (3) “a significant benefit, whether pecuniary
or nonpecuniary, has been conferred on the general public or a large class of
persons,” (4) “the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement . . .
are such as to make the award appropriate, and” (5) “such fees should not in
the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery, if any.” (CCP § 1021.5.) 
 
Petitioner moves for an award of
attorney fees under CCP § 1021.5. Petitioner asserts that it is the prevailing
party because it successfully challenged the County’s adoption of an amendment to
the General Plan’s Safety Element that violated Gov. Code § 65302(g)(5). This section
requires that the County "identify residential developments in any hazard
area identified in the safety element that do not have at least two emergency
evacuation routes." The Court granted Petitioner’s writ on this issue,
finding the County failed to comply with Gov. Code § 65302(g)(5).
 
Petitioner argues that it is entitled to fees under section 1021.5 because the petition
has enforced important public rights - the enforcement of Gov. Code § 65302(g)(5), has resulted in a significant
benefit to the public by requiring the City to properly identify and assess
communities that are at increased risk of danger due to lack of evacuation
routes in the event of a natural disaster, and the financial burden of private
enforcement makes an award of fees appropriate. Additionally, there is no
monetary recovery to cover attorney’s fees.
 
Petitioner is the prevailing party in
this action and is entitled to fees under CCP § 1021.5. Petitioner has achieved
a principal litigation objective, conferring a significant benefit on the public.
Petitioner and Petitioner’s counsel brought this action at financial risk.
 
B. Reasonableness of Attorney’s Fees
 
Petitioner asserts that Hanson Bridgett
LLP incurred $143,124.50 in fees to prosecute this action. Petitioner seeks $72,451.50
in fees to bring and defend this motion. Counsel charges between $325.00 and
$745.00 per hour and spent 297.2 hours on this case over
approximately two years. Respondents
argue that counsel’s fees are vague, unreasonable and inefficient, counsel’s
hourly rates are excessive and fees should be reduced for unsuccessful claims.
The Court does not take issue with counsel’s hourly rates. The Court also does
not find counsel’s hours excessive. This action lasted two years, included complicated
motion work, and resulted in a favorable outcome for Petitioner. Work on the
unsuccessful claims largely overlaps with work on the successful claims. 
 
However, the Court finds that $72,451.50
for the attorneys’ fee motion is excessive. The number of hours claimed for
preparation of the motion and reply, preparing for the hearing, and
post-hearing work exceeds a reasonable number of hours for those tasks. The
amount requested for the attorneys’ fee motion is more than 50% of the fees
requested for the work on the merits. The Court will award 18 hours for Alene
Taber’s work, 18 hours for Jillian Ames’ work, 2 hours for Evelyn Goessling’s
work, and 4.7 hours for Janell Gehrke’s work, at their respective rates, for a
total of $24,290.50.
 
Petitioner’s motion for attorney’s fees
is GRANTED in the amount of $167,415.
