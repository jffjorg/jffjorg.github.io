And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion to strike various allegations in the First Amended Complaint. The defendants argued that answering the complaint as drafted would require them to disclose confidential attorney-client communications, but the court declined to strike these allegations. The court noted that the attorney-client privilege is a rule of evidence, and whether a communication is privileged is a matter reserved for evidentiary motions or trial. The defendants' motion to strike is therefore denied.
