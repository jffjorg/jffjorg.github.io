English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling issued by Judge Maurice A. Leiter in the case of Jose Gutierrez v. Tesla Energy Operations, Inc. The defendant, Tesla Energy Operations, Inc., moved to compel arbitration based on an arbitration agreement signed by the plaintiff, Jose Gutierrez, on October 31, 2020. The court found that the defendant had met its burden to establish an agreement to arbitrate, and the burden shifted to the plaintiff to establish any defenses to enforcement. The court considered evidence and made a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and staying the action. The court found that the arbitration agreement was procedurally unconscionable due to the unequal bargaining power between the employer and employee, but not substantively unconscionable.
