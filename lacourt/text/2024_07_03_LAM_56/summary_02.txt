**Case Information**

* Case Number: 23STCV14422
* Hearing Date: July 3, 2024
* Department: 56

**Parties**

* Plaintiff: Saeed Farkhondehpour, et al.
* Defendant: Cochran, Davis & Associates, PC, et al.

**Key Points**

* The court considered the moving and opposition papers, with no reply papers filed.
* The dispute revolves around motions to quash and/or limit deposition subpoenas for production of business records.
* The subpoenas were served on Alon, LLP, First Credit Bank, Rosenheim & Associates, Inc., and Jonathan Hakakha.
* The defendants assert that the information sought is relevant to the subject matter of the action and is not privileged.

**Legal Standard**

* A motion to quash a deposition subpoena must be based on a ground specified in Code of Civil Procedure section 1987.1, such as defects in form or content, defects in service, or requesting production of records not within the permissible scope of discovery.

**Analysis**

* The court finds that the information sought in the subpoenas is relevant or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
* The court also finds that the requests are not overly broad and declines to limit their scope.
* The court notes that the party asserting a privacy interest must establish the extent and seriousness of the prospective invasion, and the court must weigh the countervailing interests of the opposing party.

**Ruling**

* The plaintiff's motions are denied.
* The moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
* The court grants sanctions to the defendants in the amount of $1,000, payable by the plaintiffs and their counsel, jointly and severally, within twenty days of the date of this order.

**Summary**

This tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motions to quash and/or limit deposition subpoenas for production of business records. The court finds that the information sought is relevant to the subject matter of the action and is not privileged. The court also grants sanctions to the defendants in the amount of $1,000 for the plaintiff's bad faith or lack of substantial justification in making the motions.
