Here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses an ex parte application to strike privileged materials from the record. The plaintiff, Leticia Vasquez, is an elected public official who serves on the Central Basin Municipal Water District's Governing Board, and has filed a complaint alleging violations of the Tom Bane Civil Rights Act. The defendants, the District and its general manager, Alex Rojas, have filed a motion for summary judgment and/or summary adjudication, and have also filed an ex parte application to strike privileged materials from the record.

The judge rules that the Report, which is a confidential investigation report, is not privileged because there is no evidence to support the contention that the author of the report, Carr, Riggs, & Ingram, LLC, is an agent of Burke, Williams & Sorensen, LLP, the law firm that represents the District.

The judge also rules that the portion of the Correspondence pertaining to the email exchange between Ponto, the general counsel of the Board, and Plaintiff is covered by the attorney-client privilege and should thus be stricken. Additionally, the Memorandum, which is a legal opinion and guidance provided by Porto to the Board as its counsel, is a protected attorney-work product and is also covered by the attorney-client privilege, and is thus stricken in its entirety.

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion is denied in part and granted in part, and that the moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
