And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is based on the evidence presented before the hearing. The judge finds that the defendant allegedly made racist comments, calling COVID-19 the "Chinese Virus" and making references to Chinese people bringing the virus to the store. The plaintiff felt offended and harassed by the comments. The judge notes that there is no suggestion that the defendant's comments were motivated by race or national origin. The judge is considering the cumulative effect of these events, stating that this incident is like the "straw that broke the camel's back". The judge will consider the evidence further and make a final ruling after the hearing.
