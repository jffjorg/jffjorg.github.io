And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendants' motions to compel the plaintiff's responses to written discovery, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The plaintiff did not serve verified responses by the due date and did not file an opposition to the motions. As a result, all objections are waived. The court has also imposed sanctions against the plaintiff and their counsel, Paul Kingston, in the amount of $880, payable to the defendants within 15 days.
