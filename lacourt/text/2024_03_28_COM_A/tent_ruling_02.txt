[TENTATIVE] ORDER
GRANTING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO COMPEL PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO SPECIAL
INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE, AND REQUEST FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER
GRANTING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO COMPEL PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR
PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET ONE, AND REQUEST FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS
 
      The complaint
alleges that Plaintiff fell and sustained injury while walking on a defective
walkway at real property owned and controlled by Defendants.  Plaintiff alleges claims for (1) negligence,
(2) breach of contract, and (3) breach of the implied covenant of good faith
and fair dealing.
      Defendants,
Clinton B. Eull, III; and Yule3.SP1LLC, move to compel Plaintiff’s initial
responses to written discovery served on October 4, 2023. Plaintiff did not
serve verified responses by the due date after three extensions to respond.
Plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motions by March 15, 2024, (nine
court days before the hearing). (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005 subd. (b).)
      Where a
party fails to timely respond to interrogatories and a document request, the
court has authority to compel a response. (Code Civ. Proc., §2030.290 subd.
(b), §2031.300 subd. (b).) Untimely responses result in a waiver of objections.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290 subd. (a), §2031.300 subd. (a).)  As Plaintiff has not served any responses, all
objections are waived.
      Imposition
of sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel is warranted as
Plaintiff has not shown substantial justification for failing to comply with discovery
obligations. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.310, 2031.310.)  The Court finds that $175 per hour to prepare
each motion is a reasonable fee to prepare discovery motions. One hour to
prepare each motion (reduced from two) and one hour to appear are both
reasonable under the circumstances. Defendant incurred costs of $180 ($60 per
motion) in filing fees. 
      Accordingly,
Defendants’ three motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses to form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, and request for production of
documents are GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses to all
written discovery at issue without objection within 15 days.  Sanctions for all three motions totaling $880
are imposed against Plaintiff and counsel, Paul Kingston, jointly and
severally, and payable to Defendants within 15 days.
