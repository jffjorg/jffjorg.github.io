And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Defendant's motion to compel the depositions of both Plaintiffs. The Judge found that the Defendant had attempted to schedule the depositions, but the Plaintiffs' counsel refused to provide available dates. The Judge also ruled that the Plaintiffs had not shown substantial justification for requiring a three-month delay in providing the Defendant with available dates for the depositions, and therefore, sanctions were warranted. The Judge ordered the Plaintiffs to appear for deposition on a date that is mutually convenient for the parties within 30 days. Additionally, the Judge imposed sanctions of $825.00 against the Plaintiffs and their counsel for the excessive time spent preparing the motion.
