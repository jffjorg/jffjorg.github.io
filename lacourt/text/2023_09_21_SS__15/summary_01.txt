## English Summary:

This document outlines a tentative ruling by a judge about two separate motions filed by defendants National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (NASSCO) and Vanderbilt Minerals, LLC. 

**NASSCO:** Plaintiffs did not oppose NASSCO's motion for summary adjudication, arguing that Plaintiffs failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove their claims of negligence and premises liability. 

The judge agreed, finding that Plaintiffs' discovery responses were vague and did not establish a genuine dispute about the facts necessary for their claims.  Therefore, the motion for summary adjudication was granted, effectively dismissing Plaintiffs' claims against NASSCO.

**Vanderbilt:** Plaintiffs sued Vanderbilt, alleging that exposure to asbestos in their talc product caused the death of the decedent.  Vanderbilt moved for summary judgment on the entire case and for summary adjudication of the punitive damages claim.

The judge noted the higher standard of proof required for punitive damages.  While Plaintiffs did not provide any documents supporting their punitive damages claim, the judge found that they could potentially obtain such evidence through depositions and other discovery.

Based on this, the judge denied Vanderbilt's motion for summary judgment but also denied their motion for summary adjudication of the punitive damages claim.

 The judge's tentative ruling means that the case will move forward against Vanderbilt, but some claims have been dismissed against NASSCO.

Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary adjudication filed by Defendant National Steel and Shipbuilding Company and Vanderbilt Minerals, LLC. The motion seeks to dismiss the first and third causes of action filed by Plaintiffs Maria Gonzalez, Roberto Gonzalez, and Gerardo Gonzalez.

The court has found that the Plaintiffs' responses to Defendant's interrogatories were factually devoid and shifted the burden to the Plaintiffs to demonstrate the existence of triable issues of fact. As a result, the court has granted the motion as to the first cause of action for negligence and the third cause of action for premises liability.

In the alternative, Defendant Vanderbilt Minerals, LLC has also moved for summary adjudication of the punitive damages claim. The court has denied this motion, finding that the Plaintiffs have shown the existence of a disputed issue regarding the presence of asbestos-containing talc from Defendant in Donald Durham Rock Hard putty.

The court has also denied Defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the punitive damages claim, finding that the Plaintiffs have not produced any evidence of fraud, malice, or oppression, and that Defendant has not shifted the burden to the Plaintiffs to demonstrate the existence of such evidence.

english:
This tentative ruling addresses two separate motions for summary adjudication, one brought by the defendant National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (NASSCO) and the other by Vanderbilt Minerals, LLC (VANDERBILT).

In the NASSCO case, the defendant filed a motion for summary adjudication of the plaintiffs' first cause of action for negligence and third cause of action for premises liability. The plaintiffs did not oppose the motion. The court found that the plaintiffs' responses to interrogatories were factually devoid and failed to present any facts about Defendant's products, shifting the burden to the plaintiffs to demonstrate the existence of triable issues of fact. As the plaintiffs did not file an opposition, the motion is granted as to the first and third causes of action.

In the VANDERBILT case, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment of the plaintiffs' claims that Roberto Gonzalez was exposed to asbestos in talc from Defendant. Alternatively, Defendant moves for summary adjudication of the punitive damages claim. The court found that the plaintiffs' discovery responses were factually devoid and shifted the burden to the plaintiffs. However, in their opposition, plaintiffs showed the existence of a disputed issue regarding the presence of asbestos-containing talc from Defendant in Donald Durham Rock Hard putty. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment is denied.

For the punitive damages claim, the court found that a higher standard of proof is required, and summary judgment or summary adjudication is proper only when no reasonable jury could find the plaintiff's evidence to be clear and convincing proof of malice, fraud, or oppression. The court denied the motion as Defendant did not shift the burden.

 **Overall:** The Judge is carefully considering the arguments and evidence presented by both sides.  The ruling on the NASSCO motion is in favor of the Defendant, but the ruling on the Vanderbilt Minerals motion is in favor of the Plaintiffs.

---

In this tentative ruling, the court addresses the motion for summary adjudication by National Steel and Shipbuilding Company and the motion for summary judgment by Vanderbilt Minerals, LLC. The court grants the motion for summary adjudication regarding the first and third causes of action against National Steel and Shipbuilding Company. However, the court denies the motion for summary judgment regarding Vanderbilt's liability and punitive damages claim due to disputed facts and insufficient evidence. Plaintiffs need to demonstrate the existence of triable issues of fact, while Defendants must show that Plaintiffs cannot establish an element of their cause of action.
