**Significant Statements:**

* "A defendant seeking summary judgment must conclusively negate a necessary element of the plaintiff’s case, or demonstrate that under no hypothesis is there a material issue of fact that requires the process of trial."
* "The defendant may, but need not, present evidence that conclusively negates an element of the plaintiff’s cause of action. The defendant may also present evidence that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, needed evidence."
* "If plaintiffs respond to comprehensive interrogatories seeking all known facts with boilerplate answers that restate their allegations, or simply provide laundry lists of people and/or documents, the burden of production will almost certainly be shifted to them once defendants move for summary judgment and properly present plaintiff’s factually devoid discovery responses."
