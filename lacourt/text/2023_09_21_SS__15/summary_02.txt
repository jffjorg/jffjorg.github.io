The court denied the motion, finding that the plaintiff did not satisfy the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure sections 2024.050, 2034.610, and 2034.620. The court also granted defendant Honeywell International's request for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), allowing the company to file its objections to the Rogers transcript late. Additionally, the court sustained defendant's objections to the Rogers transcript, finding that the transcript was not admissible as evidence.
