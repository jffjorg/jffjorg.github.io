## English text summary:

This legal document outlines the Judge's preliminary thoughts before a hearing on September 21, 2023. The Judge is considering two motions:

1. Plaintiffs' request to allow David Fractor to be added as an expert witness after the deadline.

2. Defendant Honeywell's request to be allowed to file objections to the use of former deposition testimony from Eugene Rogers.

The Judge finds that Plaintiffs did not meet the requirements to add a new expert, stating they were not diligent in handling the situation and did not show enough reason why their original expert was unavailable. 
The Judge also found that Honeywell's late filing of objections to Rogers' testimony is acceptable.

This document does not provide a final ruling, but suggests the Judge is leaning towards denying Plaintiffs' motion.

**Tentative Ruling**

### Motion to Reopen Discovery

* The court granted Plaintiffs' motion for a trial preference, setting the trial for September 25, 2023.
* The parties were to exchange expert designations, reports, and writings by August 6, 2023.
* Plaintiffs retained an expert, Robert Johnson, on June 16, 2023, and designated him as an expert on August 4, 2023.
* However, Plaintiffs did not offer Johnson's deposition date to Defendants and instead learned that he was unavailable on September 6, 2023.
* On September 8, 2023, Plaintiffs notified Defendants that they were substituting a new expert, David Fractor.
* The court denied Plaintiffs' motion to reopen discovery and allow Fractor's deposition, citing the lack of diligence in handling the matter and the prejudice to Defendants.

### Motion to Amend Expert Witness List

* The court must consider the necessity for the discovery, the diligence of the party seeking the discovery, and the reasons that the discovery was not completed.
* The court must also consider the likelihood that permitting discovery will prevent the case from going to trial or result in prejudice to any other party.
* Plaintiffs did not present evidence of the reasons why Johnson's deposition cannot go forward and did not show diligence in handling the matter.
* The court denied Plaintiffs' motion to amend the expert witness list.

* Plaintiffs listed 233 transcripts they intend to use against Honeywell, which is unreasonable, cumulative, and oppressive.
