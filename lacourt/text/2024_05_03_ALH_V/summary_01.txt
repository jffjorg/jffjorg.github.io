Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

This Tentative Ruling addresses a demurrer filed by Defendant WESCO INSURANCE COMPANY to the third cause of action for breach of insurance contract in a lawsuit brought by Plaintiff LEXHAM OLIVE, LLC against THE CARVING BOARD, LLC, WESCO INSURANCE COMPANY, RDCS SERVICE INC. DBA LJ CONSTRUCTION, and DOES 1 through 20. The court finds that the demurrer is untimely but will address the merits of the demurrer despite its untimeliness. The court finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that it is an insured under the policy and has pleaded sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action against the defendant. However, the court sustains the demurrer due to the plaintiff's failure to plead the material terms of the insurance policy and to properly allege a bad faith breach of contract claim. The court grants the defendant 20 days to amend its demurrer.
