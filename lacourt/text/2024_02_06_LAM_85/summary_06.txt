The judge also notes that a court may issue an injunction to maintain the status quo without a cause of action in the complaint. Finally, the judge addresses several specific disputes, including Tenant's miscategorization of eviction notices and Landlord's misreading of the minute order. The judge's tentative rulings aim to clarify the issues in the case and provide guidance on the next steps in the litigation.
