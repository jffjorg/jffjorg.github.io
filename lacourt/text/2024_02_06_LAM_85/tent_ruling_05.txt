 Case Number:  23STCV28792    Hearing Date:   February 6, 2024    Dept:  85 
Lawrence Worthen v. Collin
Hinds, 23STCV28792 
Tentative decision on application for preliminary injunction: denied



 
 
            Plaintiff
Lawrence Worthen (“Tenant”) applies for a preliminary injunction to enjoin Defendant
Collin Hinds (“Landlord”) from collecting rent for his unit in 5622 Keniston
Ave., Los Angeles, CA, 90043 (“Property”) during the pendency of the action.
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers and opposition (no reply was
filed) and renders the following tentative decision. 
            
            A.
Statement of the Case
            1.
The Complaint
            Plaintiff
filed the Complaint on November 27, 2023. 
The operative pleading is the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) filed
December 26, 2023, alleging (1) collection of rent on a substandard dwelling,
(2) breach of the implied warranty of habitability, (3) private nuisance, and
(4) a violation of unfair competition law, Business and Professions Code
sections 17200 et seq.  The FAC
alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            Tenant
has rented the Property pursuant to a rental agreement (“Lease”) with Landlord since
December 15, 2022.  The City of Los
Angeles’ Housing Authority (“HA”) was a party to this Lease and agreed to pay a
portion of the rent.  
            When
he signed the Lease, Tenant did not know it was illegal for Landlord to charge
rent in the Property’s substandard condition. 
For the past eight months the Property has been infested with mold and
had electrical and structural defects along with a damaged roof.  
            Landlord
knows about these problems due to numerous complaints from Tenant and from a
Mold Inspection and Testing Report by Nations Laboratories and Indoor Restore
Environmental Services.  Landlord has still
to address these issues.
            Tenant
seeks actual, general, special, punitive, and exemplary damages along with
attorney’s fees and costs.  Actual
damages include rent due and paid during the tenancy.  Tenant also seeks injunctive relief
compelling Landlord to cease his current course of conduct and correct all
existing code violations and uninhabitable conditions of the Property.
 
            2. Course of Proceedings[1]
            On
December 18, 2023, Department 47 (Hon. Theresa Taber) denied Tenant’s
handwritten application for a preliminary injunction enjoining Landlord from
transferring possession of the Property and neighboring properties during the
pendency of this action.  Taber ordered Tenant
to file a motion with supporting declarations if he sought this relief.
            On
December 5, 2023, Tenant personally served Landlord with the Complaint and
Summons.
            On
January 16, 2024, this court granted Tenant’s ex parte application for a
temporary restraining order (“TRO”) and order to show cause (“OSC”) re:
preliminary injunction enjoining Landlord from collecting rent for the pendency
of this action.
            On
January 17, 2024, Tenant personally served Landlord with the TRO/OSC.

Applicable Law
            1.
Preliminary Injunctions
            An
injunction is a writ or order requiring a person to refrain from a particular
act; it may be granted by the court in which the action is brought, or by a
judge thereof; and when granted by a judge, it may be enforced as an order of
the court.  Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”)
§525.  An injunction may be more
completely defined as a writ or order commanding a person either to perform or
to refrain from performing a particular act. 
See Comfort v. Comfort, (1941) 17 Cal.2d 736, 741. McDowell
v. Watson, (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1155, 1160.[2]  It is an equitable remedy available generally
in the protection or to prevent the invasion of a legal right.  Meridian, Ltd. v. City and County of San
Francisco, et al., (1939) 13 Cal.2d 424.
            The
purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo
pending final resolution upon a trial.  See
Scaringe v. J.C.C. Enterprises, Inc., (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1536. Grothe
v. Cortlandt Corp., (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1313, 1316; Major v. Miraverde
Homeowners Assn., (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 618, 623.  The status quo has been defined to
mean the last actual peaceable, uncontested status which preceded the pending
controversy.  Voorhies v. Greene
(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 989, 995, quoting United Railroads v. Superior Court,
(1916) 172 Cal. 80, 87. 14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s Assn. v. VRT Corp.,
(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402.
            A
preliminary injunction is issued after hearing on a noticed motion.  The complaint normally must plead injunctive
relief.  CCP §526(a)(1)-(2).[3]  Preliminary injunctive relief requires the
use of competent evidence to create a sufficient factual showing on the grounds
for relief.  See e.g. Ancora-Citronelle
Corp. v. Green, (1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 146, 150.  Injunctive relief may be granted based on a
verified complaint only if it contains sufficient evidentiary, not ultimate,
facts.  See CCP §527(a).  For this reason, a pleading alone rarely
suffices.  Weil & Brown, California
Procedure Before Trial, 9:579, 9(ll)-21 (The Rutter Group 2007).  The burden of proof is on the plaintiff as
moving party.  O’Connell v. Superior
Court, (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1452, 1481. 
            A
plaintiff seeking injunctive relief must show the absence of an adequate
damages remedy at law.  CCP §526(4); Thayer
Plymouth Center, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors, (1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 300, 307; Department
of Fish & Game v. Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation Dist., (1992) 8
Cal.App.4th 1554, 1565.  The concept of
“inadequacy of the legal remedy” or “inadequacy of damages” dates from the time
of the early courts of chancery, the idea being that an injunction is an
unusual or extraordinary equitable remedy which will not be granted if the
remedy at law (usually damages) will adequately compensate the injured
plaintiff.  Department of Fish &
Game v. Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation Dist., (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1554,
1565.
            In
determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction, the trial court
considers two factors: (1) the reasonable probability that the plaintiff will
prevail on the merits at trial (CCP §526(a)(1)), and (2) a balancing of the
“irreparable harm” that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction is
denied as compared to the harm that the defendant is likely to suffer if the
court grants a preliminary injunction. 
CCP §526(a)(2); 14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s Assn. v. VRT Corp.,
(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402; Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro v.
Schectman, (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1283; Davenport v. Blue Cross of
California, (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 435, 446; Abrams v. St. Johns Hospital,
(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 628, 636.  Thus, a
preliminary injunction may not issue without some showing of potential
entitlement to such relief.  Doe v.
Wilson, (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 296, 304. 
The decision to grant a preliminary injunction generally lies within the
sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent
an abuse of discretion.  Thornton v.
Carlson, (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1249, 1255.
            A
preliminary injunction ordinarily cannot take effect unless and until the
plaintiff provides an undertaking for damages which the enjoined defendant may
sustain by reason of the injunction if the court finally decides that the
plaintiff was not entitled to the injunction. 
See CCP §529(a); City of South San Francisco v. Cypress Lawn
Cemetery Assn., (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 916, 920.
 
            2.
Nuisance
            Anything
which is injurious to health, including, but not limited to, the illegal sale
of controlled substances, or is indecent or offensive to the senses, or an
obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the
comfortable enjoyment of life or property, or unlawfully obstructs the free
passage or use, in the customary manner, of any public park, square, street or
highway, is a nuisance.  Civil Code
§3479.  
            A
nuisance that is not a public nuisance is a private nuisance.  Civil Code §3481.  Civil action and abatement are among the
proper remedies for nuisance.  Civil Code
§§ 3491, 3501.  “Abatement” is the
removal or destruction of the thing which constitutes the nuisance without
committing a breach of the peace or doing unnecessary injury.  Civil Code §§ 3495, 3501.   A private person may abate either a public
or private nuisance.  Civil Code §§ 3495,
3502.  
            Where
a civil action is filed against a private nuisance, the defendant property
owner is presumed to know the business conducted at his or her property.  People ex rel. Bradford v. Barbiere,
(1917) 33 Cal.App. 770, 779.  Owners of
premises where nuisance acts occur may be liable even if they are not negligent
in permitting the nuisance to occur.  Lew
v. Superior Court, (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 866, 871 (property was nuisance
because used for sale of drugs; court did not decide whether liability could be
imposed on owners whose property is a nuisance through no fault of their own).
A plaintiff does not have a right of private eminent domain to compel a
defendant landowner to install a nuisance remedy on the latter’s property.  Aspen Grove Condominium Association v. CNL
Income Northstar, LLC, (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 53, 62-63 (preliminary
injunction against nuisance water retention basin which seeped water onto
landowner’s property; landowner was not required to permit an interceptor
trench to be built on its property as a remedy).  
            A
dwelling shall be deemed untenantable if it is a residential unit described in
Health & Safety Code (“H&S Code”) section 17920.3 or 17920.10.  Civil Code §1941.1(a).  H&S Code section 17920.3(a)-(c) defines a
substandard building as any building or portion thereof in which there exists inadequate
sanitation, structural hazards, or a nuisance to such an extent that endangers
the life, limb, health, property, safety, or welfare of the public or the
occupants thereof.  “Inadequate
sanitation” includes but is not limited to (13) visible mold growth, except
when minor and on surfaces that can accumulate moisture as part of their
properly functioning and intended use; (14) general dilapidation or improper maintenance.  H&S Code §17920.3(a).  Structural hazards include but are not
limited to (1) deteriorated or inadequate foundations and (2) defective or
deteriorated flooring or floor supports. 
H&S Code §17920.3(b).  
            No
duty to repair a dilapidation shall arise for the landlord if the tenant is in
substantial violation of one of a predefined set of affirmative obligations, if
the violation substantially contributed to the existence of the dilapidation or
interferes with the landlord’s obligation to effect necessary repairs.  Civil Code §1941.2(a).  One such duty is the duty to properly use and
operate all electrical, gas and plumbing fixtures and keep them as clean and
sanitary as their condition permits.  Civil
Code §1941.2(a)(3).
Substandard housing conditions may constitute a public or
private nuisance.  On a finding that the
building violates the state housing law, the tenant or a tenant association may
seek an order appointing a receiver for the substandard building pursuant to
H&S Code section 1790.7(c).  Erlach
v. Sierra Asset Servicing, LLC, (“Erlach”) (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th
1281, 1293-94.  If a receiver is
appointed, the owner of the substandard building will be enjoined from
collecting rents from the tenants.  Id.
at 1294.  
Civil Code section 1942.4 provides a tenant with a statutory
cause of action where the premises are untenantable.  Erlach, supra, 226 Cal.App.4th
1281, 1293-98 (building inspector’s “red tag” of building and order for tenant
to vacate due to unsafe conditions did not terminate the tenancy for purposes
of damages).  A landlord of a dwelling
may not demand rent, collect rent, issue a notice of a rent increase, or issue
a three-day notice to pay rent or quit if all of the following apply: (1) the
dwelling, inter alia, is substandard per H&S Code section 17920.3;
(2) a public officer or employee who is responsible for the enforcement of any
housing law, after inspecting the premises, has notified the landlord or the
landlord’s agent in writing of his or her obligations to abate the nuisance or
repair the substandard conditions; (3) the conditions have existed and not been
abated for 35 days beyond the date of service of said notice; and (4) the
conditions were not caused by an act or omission of the tenant that violates
Civil Code sections 1929 or 1941.2. 
Civil Code §1942.4(a).
             In addition, the implied warranty of
habitability provides the tenant with a remedy. 
The tenant may either defend an unlawful detainer action or bring suit
against the landlord for damages from the breach.  Id .at 1297.  The implied warranty does not require a
landlord to ensure that leased premises are in perfect, aesthetically pleasing
condition, but “bare living requirements” must be maintained.  Green v. Superior Court, (1974) 10
Cal.3d 616, 637.  Where the landlord
breaches the implied warranty, the tenant is not excused from paying rent; he
or she remains liable for the reasonable rental value during the period that
the defective condition existed.  See Erlach,
supra, 226 Cal.App.4th at 1298.

Statement of Facts
            1.
Tenant’s Evidence
            As
of March 14, 2022, Tenant met the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development’s (“HUD”) definition of a Person with Disabilities.  Worthen Decl., ¶7, Ex. G.  He is legally blind, has recently suffered a
stroke, and has both a bad vertebrae in his spine and a newly operated knee.  Worthen Decl., ¶7.
 
            a.
Property History
            On
December 14, 2022, Tenant signed a one-year lease for the Property effective
the next day.  Worthen Decl., Decl.,
¶2(a), Ex. A.  Tenant agreed to pay
$2,045 per month in rent and acknowledged the condition of the premises as
described in an attached Statement of Condition.  Worthen Decl., ¶2(a), Ex. A.  Tenant also acknowledged receipt of an
attached booklet title “Information on Dampness and Mold for Renters in
California.”  Worthen Decl., ¶2(a), Ex.
A.
            Tenant
agreed to use and safeguard all fixtures and to immediately notify Landlord of
any problem, malfunction, or damage with any item.  Worthen Decl., ¶2(a), Ex. A, §11.A.  Tenant would be financially responsible for
any repairs or replacements he caused, including damage that results from a
failure to timely report a problem.  Worthen
Decl., ¶2(a), Ex. A, §11.A.  
            Landlord
has been in continuous violation of the Lease since December 15, 2022.  Worthen Decl., ¶2(b).  On September 11, 2023, Indoor Restore
Environmental Services (“Indoor”) confirmed the presence of mold at the
Property via a test by Nation Laboratories. 
Worthen Decl., ¶3(a), Ex. B.  On
September 15, the Department of Environmental Health (“DEH”) filed a complaint,
Case No. COO386573 (“DEH Complaint”), for failure to address mold at the
Property.  Worthen Decl., ¶3(b).  
            The
Property failed a September 21, 2023 HUD inspection based on a cracked wall and
damage to the ceiling of a closet in the front room.  Worthen Decl., ¶12, Ex. L.  The ventilation needed weatherization, and
the water heater made a knocking noise.  Worthen
Decl., ¶12, Ex. L.  To date, repairs on
these issues are not complete.  Worthen
Decl., ¶12.
            Landlord
issued Notices to Enter Dwelling for September 28, November 28-30, and various
days in December 2023.  Worthen Decl., ¶4(a),
Ex. D.[4]  Several of these notices cite mold, Section 8
inspections, and the need to make necessary, agreed, or mold remediation
repairs.  Worthen Decl., ¶4(a), Ex.
D.  The December 6 notice also cited the
need to install “toilet and floor.”  Worthen
Decl., ¶4(a), Ex. D.  
            Rapid
Response Mold Testing performed a mold inspection based on samples from
December 15, 2023.  Worthen Decl., ¶4(b),
Ex. E.  The Mold Inspection Report revealed
fungal growth on the storage wall.  Worthen
Decl., ¶4(b), Ex. E.  
            On
December 27, 2023, REHS Chief Environmental Health Specialist Yvette Boston (“Boston”)
conducted the fourth mold test on the Property. 
Worthen Decl., ¶3(c), Ex. K.  Because
the Property failed the test, the test confirmed the Property still had ongoing
mold issues.  Worthen Decl., ¶3(c)[5].  
            The
DEH Complaint remains open, and an inspector has confirmed ongoing mold
presence.  Worthen Decl., ¶7.[6]  Boston’s inspection also confirmed the
Property suffers from several building safety code violations, including a
buckled subflooring due to improper flooring installation.  Worthen Decl., ¶10.[7]
 
            b.
Damages
            On
October 4, 2023, Tenant visited his doctor based on shortness of breath,
wheezing, chest pain, an enlarged aorta, and a multinodular goiter.  Worthen Decl., ¶5(a), Ex. F.  Cedars Sinai prescribed Advair for a month
and told him to use albuterol only if needed for shortness of breath.  Worthen Decl., ¶5(a), Ex. F.  It also advised him to “consider
environmental change” to see if he felt better “without particular
environmental factor.”  Worthen Decl., ¶5(a),
Ex. F.  
            A
Mosaic Diagnostics Report based on a November 16, 2023 sample found above-normal
levels of the mycotoxin Citrinin in Tenant’s bloodstream.  Worthen Decl., ¶5(a), Ex. F.  
            Tenant’s
utility bill increased by $420 from November 28 to December 15, 2023 due to the
conditions at the Property.  Worthen
Decl., ¶6.
            Property
damage from the mold includes $2,000 in clothes, $1,320 in shoes, $450 in
kitchen items, $800 in the dining room, $1,900 in the living room, $2,100 in Tenant’s
bedroom, $300 in curtains, and $400 in pictures for a total of $9,270.  Worthen Decl., ¶9, Ex. I.  
            Tenant
has incurred various other expenses because of the mold.  Worthen Decl., ¶10, Ex. J.  
 
            2.
Landlord’s Evidence
            a.
Merits
            On
September 1, 2023, Tenant told Landlord and management company 401k Realty that
he has left the washing machine on and returned to witness flooding on at least
three different occasions.  Hinds Decl.,
¶4.  This flooding occurred between December
17, 2022 and February 28, 2023, months before Tenant told Landlord.  Hinds Decl., ¶4.  This caused mold and other damage to the
apartment floor.  Hinds Decl., ¶4.  Tenant’s failure to report the floods before
this damage occurred constituted a violation of the Lease.  Hinds Decl., ¶4.  
            Based
on the mold, Tenant filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Dept, of
Public Health (“DPH”), Case No. CO0389837 (“DPH Complaint”).  Hinds Decl., ¶4.  This led to inspections on November 9 and
December 27, 2023, and January 11, 2024. 
Hinds Decl., ¶4, Ex. B.  The DPH inspection
report from January 11, 2024 confirmed that Landlord had removed the mold on
the closet wall.  Hinds Decl., ¶4, Ex. B.  As for the soft flooring foundation in the
kitchen and wash area, DPH referred the matter to the Building and Safety
Southwest District.  Hinds Decl., ¶4, Ex.
B.  DPH would therefore close the DPH Complaint.  Hinds Decl., ¶4, Ex. B.  
            Landlord
and 401k Realty incurred $11,000 in costs related to mold testing, mold
abatement and flooring repair.  Hinds
Decl., ¶5, Ex. C.  These costs may not
reflect all costs that resulted from Tenant’s failure to timely communicate
multiple floodings.  Hinds Decl., ¶5.  
            Based
on a monthly rent of $2,047, the rent for the days Landlord had to access the
Property to repair the damage totaled $1,023.60.  Hinds Decl., ¶6, Ex. D.  Landlord has reimbursed Worthen for those
days via a $400 check on November 28, 2023, and $623.60 check on January 5,
2024.  Hinds Decl., ¶6, Ex. D.  
            On
December 18, 2023, the Los Angeles County Development Authority sent Landlord
notice that Tenant had issued a lease termination notice for the Property,
effective December 31, 2023.  Hinds
Decl., Ex. J.  The Development Authority
would not provide housing assistance payments for any month after Tenant
vacates the premises.  Hinds Decl., Ex.
J.  Despite this notice, Tenant has not
moved out of the Property.  Hinds Decl.,
¶15.  He refuses to sign documentation
allowing Section 8 to pay a portion of the rent.  Hinds Decl., ¶15.  Enjoining Landlord from collecting rent from Tenant
will impact Hind’s income as a single father of two sons.  Hinds Decl., ¶15.  
 
            b.
Course of Proceedings
            On
December 18, 2023, Department 47 issued a minute order compelling Tenant to
serve Landlord with the Complaint, Summons, and any motion for a preliminary
injunction.  Hinds Decl., ¶7; RJN Ex.
A.  Tenant never served Landlord with
this minute order.  Hinds Decl., ¶7.[8]
            On
December 26, 2023, Louis Francis (“Francis”) filed a notice declaration for an ex
parte application for a TRO/OSC.  RJN Ex.
C.  He asserted that he called Landlord’s
number, 310-863-4032, at 8:00 a.m. that day to give notice of the application.  RJN Ex. C. 
Landlord’s call log does not show he received a call from Francis at
that time or any time that day.  Hinds
Decl., ¶8, Ex. E.
            Later
that day, Alexandra Melgoza alleged via signed proof of service that she personally
served the FAC and ex parte application for a TRO/OSC.  Hinds Decl., ¶9; RJN Ex. D.  In reality, Tenant only served an unsigned
copy of the ex parte application by taping a copy to Landlord’s
door.  Hinds Decl., ¶9; RJN Ex. B.  Landlord did not see this copy until December
28, 2023, the day after the hearing on the application.  Hinds Decl., ¶9.  
            On
December 27, 2023, Department 1 continued the hearing on the ex parte
application to January 2, 2024, and ordered Tenant to give notice.  RJN Ex. E. 
Instead of personally serving this minute order by personal delivery to Landlord,
who lives above the Property, Tenant mailed it by certified mail.  Hinds Decl., ¶10, Ex. F.  Landlord did not receive the certified
mailing until January 11, 2024.  Hinds
Decl., ¶10.
            On
January 3, 2024, Tenant filed a new, unsigned ex parte application but
failed to personally serve it.  Hinds
Decl., ¶11; RJN Ex. G.  The application included
a declaration from Francis alleging that he called Landlord the day before at
9:57 a.m., and a proof of service asserting that Francis served the application
via mail.  Hinds Decl., ¶11; RJN Ex.
G.  Neither is true.  Hinds Decl., ¶11.  Tenant withdrew this application.  RJN Ex. H. 

            On
January 8, 2024, Octavio Lopez (“Lopez”) left Landlord a voicemail stating that
Tenant would appear ex parte on January 10, 2024 seeking a TRO/OSC.  Hinds Decl., ¶12.  That hearing never went forward.  Hinds Decl., ¶12.
            On
January 10, 2024, Lopez asserted via declaration he gave Landlord notice of an ex
parte application for January 11 via phone at 8:50 a.m.  Hinds Decl., ¶13; RJN Ex. I.  This declaration’s signature was dated
January 8, two days before the purported notice.  Hinds Decl., ¶13; RJN Ex. I.  In any case, Landlord’s call logs do not show
any such call.  Hinds Decl., ¶13, Ex. G.
            On
January 11, 2024, Tenant filed three versions of a proposed order with January
11 as the hearing date, along with a fourth with January 12 as the hearing
date.  Hinds Decl., ¶14; RJN Ex. J.  Tenant did not serve Landlord with any of the
proposed orders.  Hinds Decl., ¶14.
 
            D.
Analysis
            Tenant seeks a
preliminary injunction enjoining Landlord from collecting rent during the
pendency of this action.
 
            1.
Procedural Defects
            When the court granted Tenant’s
ex parte application for a TRO/OSC, it ordered Tenant to personally
serve Landlord with the Complaint, Summons, and moving papers by January 17,
2024.  Landlord asserts that despite proofs
of service on file, Tenant failed to personally serve Landlord with anything
but the TRO/OSC.  Opp. at 3.
            The court need not
discuss this issue in detail.  It ordered
that Landlord file his opposition by January 28, 2024.  Because this was a Sunday, the deadline
automatically moved to the next court day, January 29, 2024.  See CRC 1.10.  Landlord filed and personally served Tenant
with his opposition that day.  Because Landlord
has generally appeared and the timely opposition addresses the merits of this application,
no prejudice has been sustained and Tenant’s service defects are waived.
 
            2. Probability of Success
            Tenant asserts that he
has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the four causes of action in
the FAC, which include collection of rent on a substandard dwelling, breach of
the implied warranty of habitability, private nuisance, and a violation of
unfair section 17200.  App. at 4.  The sole matter at issue is whether there is mold
in Tenant’s unit rendering it uninhabitable.
            Tenant presents evidence
that mold remains in his unit.  On
September 11, 2023, Indoor confirmed the presence of mold at the Property.  Worthen Decl., ¶3(a), Ex. B.  Landlord issued several Notices to Enter
Dwelling from September to December 2023, often for mold remediation
repairs.  Worthen Decl., ¶4(a), Ex. D.  Despite this, tests confirmed the continued
presence of mold as of December 15 and 27, 2023.  Worthen Decl., ¶¶ 3(c), 4(b), Ex. E.  
            Tenant also presents
evidence of harm caused by the mold.  Tenant
visited a doctor in October 2023 for shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain,
an enlarged aorta, and a multinodular goiter. 
Worthen Decl., ¶5(a), Ex. F.  Treatment
advice included an environmental change to avoid particular environmental
factors.  Worthen Decl., ¶5(a), Ex.
F.  A November 2023 test found
above-normal levels of a mycotoxin Citrinin in his bloodstream.  Worthen Decl., ¶5(a), Ex. F.  Because the mold endangered Tenant’s life,
limb, health and safety, it rendered the Property a substandard building.
            Because Tenant has only
a private inspection from Rapid Response Mold Testing that there is mold
at his unit as of December 15, 2023 (Worthen Decl., ¶4(b), Ex. E), he cannot
meet the elements of Civil Code section 1942.4(a) excusing him from paying
rent.  A landlord of a dwelling may not collect rent if all of the following
apply: (1) the dwelling, inter alia, is substandard per H&S Code section
17920.3; (2) a public officer or employee who is responsible for the
enforcement of any housing law, after inspecting the premises, has notified the
landlord or the landlord’s agent in writing of his or her obligations to abate
the nuisance or repair the substandard conditions; (3) the conditions have
existed and not been abated for 35 days beyond the date of service of said
notice; and (4) the conditions were not caused by an act or omission of the
tenant that violates Civil Code sections 1929 or 1941.2.  Civil Code §1942.4(a).
            Additionally, Landlord
presents evidence that Tenant caused of the mold.  Landlord asserts that Tenant admitted to
leaving his washing machine unattended multiple times, only to find it caused
flooding in his absence.  Hinds Decl.,
¶4.  This flooding occurred between
December 17, 2022 and February 28, 2023, but Tenant only told Landlord and 401k
Realty months later, in September 2023.  Hinds
Decl., ¶4.  Landlord asserts that this
flooding and the inability to address it when it occurred caused the mold and
structural damage. Hinds Decl.,
¶4.  Worden has not contested these
allegations.  The Lease requires Tenant
to use and safeguard all fixtures and to immediately notify Landlord of any
problem, malfunction or damage with any item. 
Worthen Decl., ¶2(a), Ex. A, §11.A. 
Tenant violated this provision when he used a washing machine that
flooded his floor three separate times.  Tenant
violated the Lease again by not telling Landlord about each incident for nine
to six months.
            Assuming arguendo
that Tenant did not cause the mold, Landlord presents evidence that he has addressed
the issue.  On January 11, 2024, DPH
issued an inspection report concluding Landlord had removed the mold on the
Property.  Hinds Decl., ¶4, Ex. B.  It therefore dismissed the DPH Complaint initiated
by Tenant.  Hinds Decl., ¶4, Ex. B.  If Landlord ever lost the right to collect
rent, he has regained it.
            Tenant has not
demonstrated a probability of success on the merits.  
 
            2.
Balance of Hardships
            The
second factor which a trial court examines is the interim harm that plaintiff
is likely to sustain if the injunction is denied as compared to the harm that
the defendant is likely to suffer if the court grants a preliminary injunction.  Donahue Schriber Realty Group, Inc. v. Nu
Creation Outreach, (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1177.  This factor involves consideration of the
inadequacy of other remedies, the degree of irreparable harm, and the necessity
of preserving the status quo.  Id.
            Tenant’s
medical reports demonstrate the mold on the Property affected his health.  Worthen Decl., ¶5(a), Ex. F.  With the mold removed, Tenant will no longer
sustain these injuries in the absence of a preliminary injunction.  
            As
Landlord notes, granting the preliminary injunction would deprive him of a
source of income.  Hinds Decl., ¶15.  He asserts that such income is important as a
single father of two sons.  Hinds Decl.,
¶15.  
            The
balance of hardships disfavors a preliminary injunction.
            
            E.
Conclusion
            The
application for a preliminary injunction is denied.
