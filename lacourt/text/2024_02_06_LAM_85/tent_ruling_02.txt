            [1] If the
court denies the plaintiff’s application for a writ of possession, any TRO must
be dissolved.  CCP §513.010(c).


            [2] Notwithstanding
any other requirements of CCP section 473, the court shall vacate any default
or dismissal resulting from attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect whenever application for relief is made no more than six
months after entry of judgment and accompanied by attorney’s sworn affidavit of
fault.  CCP §473(b).  Silverlake does not reference this provision
for mandatory relief.  Mem. at 7-8.  Because it failed to state an intention to
move for mandatory relief, it has waived it.
