  Case Number:  23STCP00104    Hearing Date:   February 6, 2024    Dept:  85 
Ajah Alvarez v. Silverlake
Auto Body and Paint, 23STCP00104
 
 
 
Tentative decision on (1)
motion for reconsideration: denied; (2) motion to vacate order granting
application for writ of possession: granted
 




 
            Defendant
Silverlake Auto Body and Paint (“Silverlake”) moves for reconsideration of the
court’s order granting Plaintiff Ajah Alvarez’s (“Alvarez”) application for a writ
of possession against Silverlake to recover a Black 2021 Subaru Crosstrek, VIN
JF2GTAACXM9357581, license plate number 8XTA450 (“Vehicle”).  Alternatively, Silverlake moves to vacate the
order.
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers (no opposition was filed) and
renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            Plaintiff
Alvarez commenced this proceeding on January 12, 2023 against Defendant Silverlake
for an order releasing the Vehicle from a mechanic’s lien.  The verified Complaint alleges in pertinent
part as follows.
            Alvarez
is the Vehicle’s owner.  Silverlake
claims to have repaired the Vehicle. 
Silverlake has not recorded a claim of mechanic’s lien against it.  Alvarez never granted an extension of credit
under Civil Code section 8460(b) or filed for relief in federal bankruptcy
court.  
            On
December 28, 2022, Alvarez gave Silverlake written notice under Civil Code
section 8482 demanding that Silverlake execute and record a release of the
lien.  Silverlake is unwilling to do so
and has not filed an action to enforce the lien.
            Alvarez
seeks a judgment that Silverlake’s lien has expired and is unenforceable under
Civil Code section 8460(a), and that releases the Vehicle from the lien.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
January 23, 2023, the court denied Alvarez’s ex parte application for a
writ of possession to recover the Vehicle.
            On
February 9 and 10, 2023, the court denied Alvarez’s second and third ex
parte application for a writ of possession to recover the Vehicle.
            On
February 28, 2023, the court granted Alvarez’s temporary restraining order (“TRO”)
and order to show cause (“OSC”) re: preliminary injunction enjoining Silverlake
for selling, auctioning, leasing or assigning possession of the Vehicle.  The court ordered Alvarez to file
supplemental moving papers with both a declaration under penalty of perjury and
memorandum of points and authorities. 
Alvarez failed to file a memorandum of points and authorities but did
file a supplemental declaration.  She
also filed an application for writ of possession that was not set on 16 court
days’ notice under CCP section 1005 or properly scheduled through the court
clerk.
            On
March 21, 2023, the court granted Alvarez’s application for a preliminary
injunction enjoining Silverlake from selling, auctioning, leasing, or assigning
possession of the Vehicle.
            On
May 18, 2023, Department 25 (Hon. Katherine Chilton) took Alvarez’s petition
for release of a mechanic’s lien off-calendar as moot.
            On
September 20 and 25, 2023, the court denied Alvarez’s ex parte
applications for a writ of possession to recover the Vehicle on the ground that
she had waited too long to seek ex parte relief.
            On
November 9, 2023, Alvarez personally served Silverlake with a copy of the
Complaint.
            On
November 15, 2023, the case was reassigned to Department 26 (Hon. Mark Windham).
            On
December 7, 2023, the court granted Alvarez’s application for a writ of
possession against Silverlake for possession of the Vehicle.  At the hearing, Silverlake’s counsel
requested a continuance because it did not receive notice of the application of
moving papers.  The court denied the
request but told Silverlake’s counsel that it could move to vacate the decision
for lack of service.
            On
January 4, 2024, this court granted Silverlake’s ex parte application to
advance the hearing date for the current motion, and for a TRO enjoining the
enforcement of the writ of possession until that hearing.
            Silverlake
has moved to dissolve the preliminary injunction.  Department 26 is scheduled to hear this motion
on February 21, 2024. 
 
            B.
Applicable Law
            1.
Reconsideration
            Code
of Civil Procedure section 1008(a) (“section 1008(a)”) provides for
reconsideration of court orders.  Section
1008(a)’s motion to reconsider is broad in scope and allows any party affected
by the order to seek reconsideration and modification, amendment or vacation of
prior orders.  Relief under section
1008(a) is strictly limited; motions to reconsider must be brought within 10
days of service of written notice of the original order.  
            A
motion for reconsideration constitutes the exclusive means for a party seeking
modification, amendment or revocation of an order.  Morite of Calif. v. Superior Court,
(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 485, 490.  To be
entitled to reconsideration, a party must show (1) new or different facts, circumstances,
or law and (2) a satisfactory explanation for failing to produce such evidence
earlier.  Kalivas v. Barry Controls
Corp., (“Kalivas”) (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1152, 1160-61.  The requirement of satisfactory explanation
for failing to provide the evidence earlier can only be described as a
strict requirement of diligence.  Garcia
v. Hejmadi (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 674, 690. 
A motion for reconsideration cannot be granted on the ground that the
court misapplied the law in its initial ruling. 
Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.  A mistake based on ignorance of law is not a
proper basis for reconsideration.  Pazderka
v. Caballeros Dimas Alang, Inc. (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 658, 670.  
            Relief
under CCP section 1008(a) is strictly limited. 
A motion to reconsider must be brought within ten days of service of
written notice of the original order.  Kalivas,
supra, 49 Cal.App.4th at 1160.  
 
            2.
Vacating an Order
A party may move for discretionary relief from a default,
dismissal, or other order under CCP section 473(b) on the ground that it was
entered as a result of the party’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable
neglect.  CCP §473(b).  An application for discretionary relief under
section 473(b) must be filed within six months of the entry of default.  CCP §473(b); Rutan v. Summit Sports, Inc.
(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 965, 970.  A party
seeking discretionary relief “must act diligently in seeking relief,” Elston
v. City of Turlock (1985) 38 Cal.3d 227, 234, and must provide a reasonable
excuse for any substantial delay in seeking such relief after discovery of the
entry of default or dismissal.  Ludka
v. Memory Magnetics, Int’l (1972) 25 Cal.App.3d 316, 321.  The moving party bears the burden of proving
that he or she is entitled to relief under section 473(b).
Section 473(b) does not expressly require a balancing of any
prejudice to the opposing party from the proposed relief.  But where the party in default moves promptly
to seek relief, and no prejudice to the opposing party will result from setting
aside the default/dismissal/order, very slight evidence will be required.  Elston v. City of Turlock, (1985) 38
Cal.3d 227, 233;  Aldrich v. San
Fernando Valley Lumber Co., (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 725, 740.  Because the law strongly favors trial and
disposition on the merits, any doubts in applying section 473 must be resolved
in favor of the party seeking relief.  Elston
v. City of Turlock, 38 Cal.3d at 233. 




Notwithstanding any other requirements of CCP section 473,
the court shall vacate any default or dismissal resulting from attorney’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect whenever application for
relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment and accompanied
by attorney’s sworn affidavit of fault. 
CCP § 473(b); Bernasconi Comm’l Real Estate v. St. Joseph’s Regional
Healthcare System (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1078, 1082.  To obtain mandatory relief under section
473(b), plaintiff’s counsel need not show that the mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect was excusable; no reason need be given for the existence of
these circumstances, mere attestation that such circumstances did exist is
sufficient to obtain relief.  Graham
v. Beers (1994) 30 CalApp.4th 1656, 1660.
If relief is granted on discretionary mistake, surprise, or
excusable neglect, the court may, in its discretion, order the moving
party to pay costs and attorney fees in granting relief where no attorney
affidavit of fault is filed.  Rogalski
v. Nabers Cadillac (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 816, 823.  The court shall, whenever relief is granted
based on an attorney’s affidavit of fault, direct attorney to pay reasonable
compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing counsel (CCP §473(b)), and the
court may direct an offending attorney to pay an amount no greater than
$1,000.00 to the State Bar Client Fund (CCP §473(c)(1)(B)).
 
            3.
Writ of Possession
            A
writ of possession is available in any pending action.  It also is available where an action has been
stayed pending arbitration, so long as the arbitration award may be ineffectual
without provisional relief.  See CCP §1281.7. 
 
            a. Procedure
            Upon
the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, a plaintiff may apply
for an order for a writ of possession. 
Unlike attachment, where Judicial Council forms are optional, the
parties must use the mandatory approved Judicial Council forms in a claim and
delivery proceeding.  (Judicial Council
Forms CD-100 et seq.).
            A
plaintiff must make a written application for a writ of possession.  CCP §512.010(a), (b); (Mandatory Form
CD-100); CCP §512.010(a).  A verified
complaint alone is insufficient.  6
Witkin, California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §255, p.203.  The application may be supported by
declarations and/or a verified complaint. 
CCP §516.030.  The declarations or
complaint must set forth admissible evidence except where expressly permitted
to be shown on information and belief.  Id.
            The
application must be executed under oath and include: (1) A showing of the basis
of the plaintiff's claim and that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of
the property claimed.  If the plaintiff's
claim is based on a written instrument, a copy of it must be attached; (2) A
showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, how the
defendant came into possession of it, and, the reasons for the detention based
on the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief; (3) A specific description
of the property and statement of its value; (4) The location of the property
according to the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief.  If the property, or some part of it, is
within a private place which may have to be entered to take possession, a
showing of probable cause to believe that the property is located there; and
(5) A statement that the property has not been taken for (a) a tax, assessment,
or fine, pursuant to a statute, or (b) an execution against the plaintiff’s
property.  Alternatively, a statement
that if the property was seized for one of these purposes, it is by statute
exempt from such seizure.  CCP
§512.010(b).
 
            b. The Hearing
            Before
noticing a hearing, the plaintiff must serve the defendant with all of the
following: (1) A copy of the summons and complaint; (2) A Notice of Application
and Hearing; and (3) A copy of the application and any supporting declaration.  CCP §512.030(a).  If the defendant has not appeared in the
action, service must be made in the same manner as service of summons and
complaint.  CCP §512.030(b).
            Each
party shall file with the court and serve upon the other party any declarations
and points and authorities intended to be relied upon at the hearing.  CCP §512.050. 
At the hearing, the court decides the merits of the application based on
the pleadings and declarations.   Id.  Upon a showing of good cause, the court may
receive and consider additional evidence and authority presented at the
hearing, or may continue the hearing for the production of such additional
evidence, oral or documentary, or the filing of other affidavits or points and
authorities.  Id.  
            The
court may order issuance of a writ of possession if both of the following are
found: (1) The plaintiff has established the probable validity of the
plaintiff’s claim to possession of the property; and (2) The undertaking
requirements of CCP section 515.010 are satisfied.  CCP §512.060(a).  “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is
more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the
defendant on that claim.”  CCP
§511.090.  This requires that the
plaintiff establish a prima facie case; the writ shall not issue if the
defendant shows a reasonable probability of a successful defense to the claim
and delivery cause of action.  Witkin,
California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §261, p.208.  A defendant’s claim of defect in the property
is not a defense to the plaintiff’s right to possess it.  RCA Service Co. v. Superior Court,
(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 1, 3.
            No
writ directing the levying officer to enter a private place to take possession
of any property may be issued unless the plaintiff has established that there
is probable cause to believe that the property is located there.  CCP §512.060(b).  
            The
successful plaintiff may obtain a preliminary injunction containing the same
provisions as a TRO that remains in effect until the property is seized by the
levying officer.[1]  CCP §513.010(c).  
            The
court may also issue a “turnover order” directing the defendant to transfer
possession of the property to the plaintiff (See Mandatory Form CD-120). 
The order must notify the defendant that failure to comply may subject
him or her to contempt of court.  CCP
§512.070.  The turnover remedy is not
issued in lieu of a writ, but in conjunction with it to provide the plaintiff
with a less expensive means of obtaining possession.  See
Edwards v Superior Court, (“Edwards”) (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 173,
178.
 
            c. The Plaintiff’s Undertaking
            Generally,
the court cannot issue an order for a writ of possession until the plaintiff
has filed an undertaking with the court (Mandatory Form CD-140 for personal
sureties).  CCP §515.010(a).  The undertaking shall provide that the
sureties are bound to the defendant for the return of the property to the
defendant, if return of the property is ordered, and for the payment to the
defendant of any sum recovered against the plaintiff.  Id. 
The undertaking shall be in an amount not less than twice the value of
the defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.  Id. 
The value of the defendant's interest in the property is determined by
the market value of the property less the amount due and owing on any
conditional sales contract or security agreement and all liens and encumbrances
on the property, and any other factors necessary to determine the defendant’s
interest in the property.  Id.
            However,
where the defendant has no interest in the property, the court must waive the
requirement of the plaintiff’s undertaking and include in the order for
issuance of the writ the amount of the defendant’s undertaking sufficient to
satisfy the requirements of CCP section 515.020(b).  CCP §515.010(b). 
 
            4.
Lien Sale
            A
person has a lien on a vehicle for repair services and storage, subject to
limitations.  Civil Code §3068(a).  The lien arises after a written statement for
charges for completed work or services is given to the vehicle’s registered
owner or 15 days after the work or services are completed, whichever occurs
first.  Ibid.  The lien is extinguished 30 days after it
arises unless (A) the lienholder either applies to the DMV for an authorization
to conduct the sale or (B) a court action is filed before then.  Civil Code §3068(b)(1).  
            A
lien in excess of $1500 for work performed, and in excess of $1025 for any
storage of the vehicle, is invalid unless written consent of the vehicle’s
legal owner or lessor was obtained before the work was performed or the storage
occurred.  Civil Code §3068(c)(1).  The “legal owner” is defined as a person
holding a security interest in a vehicle which is subject to UCC.  Civil Code §3067; Vehicle Code §370.   The lien shall be extinguished if the
vehicle’s legal owner or lessor tenders, by cashier’s check or cash, the amount
for storage, safekeeping, or parking space rental to which the lienholder is
entitled under Civil Code section 3068(c). 

            The
lienholder shall apply to the DMV for authorization to conduct a liens sale for
any vehicle with a value more than $4000. 
Civil Code §3071(a).  For a
vehicle valued at $4000 or less, the lienholder shall apply to the DMV for the
names and addresses of the registered and legal owners and notify them of a
pending lien sale.  Civil Code §3071(a),
(b).  If the DMV receives a timely
Declaration of Opposition form, it shall notify the lienholder within 16 days
of receipt of the form that a lien sale shall not be conducted unless the
lienholder files an action in court within 30 days of the DMV’s notice.  Civil Code §3071(d).  Any lien sale shall be void if the lienholder
does not comply with this requirement. 
Civil Code §3071(l).
            
            C. Statement of Facts 
            1.
Merits
            On
November 30, 2022, Silverlake Manager A.C. Abegian (“Abegian”) provided Alvarez
with Repair Order 10212 as she dropped the Vehicle off for repairs.  Abegian Decl., ¶2.  The repair order listed the cost as $3,251.03.  Abegian Decl., ¶2.  Abegian never wrote on the repair order that
Alvarez owed no balance for the repair work. 
Abegian Decl., ¶2.  
            On
December 27, 2022, Silverlake finished repair of the Vehicle.  Abegian Decl., ¶3.  Abegian called AAA, which said that it already
paid $1,239.21 to Alvarez for the damage and would pay only the balance to
Silverlake.  Abegian Decl., ¶3.  Abegian contacted Alvarez and asked her to
pay $1,239.21 for the repair work.  Abegian
Decl., ¶4.
            On
December 30, 2022, Abegian texted Alvarez an offer to reduce the daily storage
fee if she paid in cash.  Abegian Decl.,
¶5.  She said she would pay in cash but
never did.  Abegian Decl., ¶5.  
            On
January 19, 2023, Alvarez arrived at the Silverlake premises screaming, cursing,
and refusing to leave until Silverlake released the Vehicle.  Abegian Decl., ¶6.  She insulted Abegian and screamed at
customers.  Abegian Decl., ¶6.  Silverlake could not conduct business until
police arrived and escorted Alvarez off the premises about two hours
later.  Abegian Decl., ¶6.  
 
            2.
Lack of Notice
            Counsel
for Silverlake Noah Green, Esq. (“Green”) never received service of Alvarez’s
application for a writ of possession. 
Green Decl., ¶2.  On November 29,
2023, Wells Fargo informed Green’s co-counsel, Abraham Niman, Esq. (“Niman”), about
the application and asked what Silverlake would do about it.  Niman Decl., ¶2.  Niman reviewed the court’s online access to
confirm the existence of the application. 
Niman Decl., ¶2.  
            Niman
then asked his staff to download Alvarez’s application.  Niman Decl., ¶2.  Because of some “mix-up,” Niman received and reviewed
only a one-page notice of the application on Judicial Form CD-110.  Niman Decl., ¶2.  Alvarez is pro per in this action and
has made erroneous filings in the past. 
Niman Decl., ¶3.  Niman assumed that
Alvarez had made another mistake and only filed one page.  Niman Decl., ¶3.  He believed there was nothing he needed to
oppose.  Niman Decl., ¶3.  Neman was not aware that Alvarez had
submitted evidence and argument until he read this court’s tentative decision
on the application the morning of the hearing. 
Niman Decl., ¶4.  
            
            D.
Analysis
            Defendant
Silverlake moves for reconsideration of, or alternatively to vacate, the
court’s decision to grant Alvarez’s application for a writ of possession
against Silverlake to recover the Vehicle.
 
            1.
Motion to Reconsider
            a.
Timeliness
            A
motion to reconsider must be filed within ten days of service of written notice
of the original order.  Kalivas, supra,
49 Cal.App.4th at 1160.  The court
granted the writ of possession on December 7, 2023.  Because December 17, 2023 was a Sunday, the deadline
was extended to the next court day, December 18.  CRC 1.10. 
Because Silverlake filed this motion on that date, the motion is timely.
 
            b.
Request to Reconsider
            To be entitled
to reconsideration, a party must show (1) new or different facts, circumstances,
or law and (2) a satisfactory explanation for failing to produce such evidence
earlier.  Kalivas v. Barry Controls Corp., (“Kalivas”)
(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1152, 1160-61. The requirement of satisfactory
explanation for failing to provide the evidence earlier can only be
described as a strict requirement of diligence.  Garcia, supra,
58 Cal.App.4th at 690.   
            Silverlake
argues that the new fact is that Alvarez preserved Silverlake’s mechanic’s lien
when she filed this Complaint within 30 days after the lien arose under Civil
Code section 3068(b)(1).  Mem. at 5.  Alternatively, the new fact is that, even if
the mechanic’s lien has not been preserved Alvarez would still owe $2,925 for
the first 15 days of storage fees under Vehicle Code section 10652.5(a).  Mem. at 6. 

Silverlake’s first contention about the proper interpretation
of Civil Code section 3068(b)(1) is not a new fact or circumstance that was not
before the court during the hearing on the application.  It is an argument based on the interpretation
of a law that was before the court. 
Silverlake’s second contention about Alvarez’s obligation to pay storage
fees has no bearing on the issue of possession. 
Silverlake is free to pursue that contention during the lawsuit without
possession of the Vehicle.  The motion to
reconsider is denied.
 
            2.
Motion to Vacate
            Silverlake
moves under CCP section 473(b) for the court to set aside the order granting
Alvarez’s application for a writ of possession. 
Mem. at 7.  Silverlake relies on the
discretionary prong of CCP section 473(b),[2]
whereby a party may move for discretionary relief from a default, dismissal, or
other order on the ground that it was entered because of the party’s mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. 
Silverlake cites Hover v. MacKenzie (1954) 122 Cal.App.2d 852, 857,
which defines “excusable neglect” to include neglect which might have been the
act of a reasonably prudent person under the same circumstances.  Mem. at 7-8. 

Silverlake’s neglect was not excusable.   Niman learned there was an opposition, had
staff download it, received only one page, and wrongly assumed that Alvarez did
not submit any supporting evidence without asking his staff or checking the
online filing himself.  Niman Decl., ¶¶
2-3.  Instead of appearing at the noticed
hearing and asking for a continuance, or filing an opposition based on untimely
notice, he then chose not to oppose the application until he learned of this
mistake on the morning of the hearing.  Niman
Decl., ¶4.  A reasonably prudent person would
not have responded in the same way. 
Silverlake is not entitled to discretionary relief under CCP section
473(b).
However, Silverlake also asserts that Alvarez never properly
served the application, despite the proof of service on file.  Green Decl., ¶2.  Green only learned about the application on
November 29, 2023, when Wells Fargo informed Green’s co-counsel, Niman, about it.  Niman Decl., ¶2.  Niman reviewed the court’s online access to
confirm the existence of the application. 
Niman Decl., ¶2.  He then directed
staff to download the application from the online copy of court filings,
received only the first page from staff, and assumed it was the only page of
the filing.  Niman Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.
            The filing of proof of service creates a rebuttable
presumption that the service was proper if it complies with applicable
statutory requirements.  Floveyor
Internat. v. Sup. Ct. (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 789, 795.  The proof of service supporting Alvarez’s
application filed on November 9, 2023 states that Ted Sorrano served Green
personally on November 9, 2023 at 4:18 p.m. 
Mr. Sorrano states that he is not a registered process server but fails
to provide any identifying information that would enable him to be
subpoenaed.  This proof of service may
comply with CCP section 1011, but it is non-compliant with the Judicial Council
form POS-020.  In any event, it is rebutted
by Green’s declaration.  Thus, Silverlake
only had notice of the December 7 hearing when its counsel learned of it on
November 29, six court days before the hearing.
            Service
of moving and supporting papers in any law and motion matter shall occur at
least 16 days before the hearing.  CCP
§1005(b).  Silverlake has demonstrated
that it did not receive adequate notice and the writ of possession order is
vacated.
 
            E.
Conclusion
            The
motion for reconsideration is denied. 
The motion to vacate is granted.
