And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling states that if the court denies the plaintiff's application for a writ of possession, any temporary restraining order (TRO) must be dissolved. Additionally, the court notes that under California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b), when an attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect results in a default or dismissal, the court can vacate the default or dismissal if an application for relief is made within six months of the entry of judgment and accompanied by an attorney's sworn affidavit of fault. However, the court finds that Silverlake did not intend to move for mandatory relief and has therefore waived this option.
