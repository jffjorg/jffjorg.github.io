 Case Number:  23STCP01063    Hearing Date:   February 6, 2024    Dept:  85 
 
Public Land for Public
Use v. City of Beverly Hills and Beverly Hills City Council, 23STCP01063

 
Tentative decision on motion
to compel further responses: granted in part



            
 
Petitioner Public Land for Public Use (“PLPU”) moves to
compel Respondent City of Beverly Hills (“City”) to provide further
discovery responses to its Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two
(“RFPs”).  
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and renders
the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Petition
            Petitioner
PLPU commenced this action on April 7, 2023, against the City and its City
Council (collectively, “City”), alleging three causes of action for traditional
mandamus.  The Petition names the City
Clerk as a Real Party-in-Interest and alleges in pertinent part as follows.  
            This
action concerns five acres of City-owned property on Foothill Road between W. 3rd
Street and Alden Drive in Beverly Hills, CA (“Property”).  The City has attempted to dispose of the
Property in the past but has faced opposition each time.  To avoid this, Council placed a vague,
unknowable “Item E-6” on its January 24, 2023 meeting agenda which simply said that
the subject ordinance would declare “certain real property owned by the City
meets the definition of” Government Code (“Govt. Code”) section 54221(b) and that
the Subject Land Declaration (“Declaration”) is exempt from the California Environmental
Quality Act (“CEQA”).  Pet. Ex. 2.
            Item
E-6 does not describe the Property’s location or size, and it does not alert
citizens of the City’s intent to cease use of the Property.  The City staff’s comment underneath Item E-6
says that this would allow the City to negotiate with “entities in agreements
such as ground leases, to redevelop the properties with future projects that do
not meet the definition of Exempt Surplus Land.”  This comment does not make it clear that E-6
applies to City-owned property.  
            The
placement of Item E-6 on a consent calendar meant that it would be treated as a
routine matter.  This avoided a public
hearing which would notify residents of Council’s intention.  Citizens only learned about Item E-6 when a
City watchdog consultant reviewed the agenda report and advised residents of
the intended action.  When two residents
raised concerns, a Councilmember removed the agenda item from the consent
calendar.  The City Council majority
still refused to continue the matter for proper notice and input from
residents.  
            A
City official revealed during the same meeting that the purpose of the Declaration
was to allow the City to receive an offer from United Talent Agency (“UTA”) to
lease the Property.  Item E-6 did not
disclose this fact.  The City also
concealed that it could not meet the requirements under the Surplus Land Act
(“SLA”), Govt. Code sections 54221 et seq, to declare that City property
is “surplus land.”  
            Well-established
protocol requires the City to initiate robust public outreach and study to
elicit public input on whether the use of City property should change and for
what purpose.  When asked at the January
24 meeting why it did not do this, the City falsely asserted that plans for
such property use cannot be legally discussed without a declaration that the
Property is surplus land.  The SLA does not
require this confidentiality.
            Despite
public requests to re-notice and continue the hearing for public input, and
without findings or the ability to find that the Property is actually surplus
land, the City approved Resolution No. 23-R-13447 (“Resolution”) and the Declaration.  The Resolution stated that the Property is “surplus
land” not necessary for the City use within the meaning of the SLA.  It described the Property as four parcels and
a combined five acres of land.  Existing
developments include a 62,000 square-foot office building with two stories, subterranean
parking, and adjacent surface parking.  Other
uses included a dog park, a laydown yard, and vehicle storage. 
            The
Resolution asserted that most of the Property was formerly leased to a private
entity and has been vacant for many years. 
The low-intensity development of adjacent properties provided a unique
opportunity to assemble the properties for a single project. 
            The
lack of transparency in this matter also violated the Brown Act, Govt. Code
section 54950 et seq.
            PLPU
seeks an injunctive relief restraining the City from implementing or taking
further action on the Resolution, a writ of mandate invalidating the
Resolution, and an award of attorney’s fees and costs.
 
            2. Course of Proceedings
            On April 12, 2023, the
court denied PLPU’s ex parte application for a temporary restraining
order (“TRO”) and order to show cause re: preliminary injunction (“OSC”)
enjoining the City from giving any legal force or effect to the Resolution or Declaration,
and from taking any action in reliance on said Resolution.  The court ruled that PLPU failed to
demonstrate any risk of harm without a pending project, sale, lease, or
development.
            On
May 11, 2023, the City filed its Answer.
            On
September 12, 2023, this court set a discovery cutoff of October 27, 2023 and a
November 16, 2023 deadline for filing any discovery motion.
 
            B. Applicable Law 
            Motions
to compel discovery must comply with discovery “cut-off” dates.  Any party shall be entitled as a matter of
right to have a discovery motion heard on or before the 15th day before the
date initially set for trial of the action. 
CCP §2024.020(a); Beverly Hospital v. Superior Court, (1993) 19
Cal.App.4th 1289, 1293-96.
 
            1. Motion
to Compel Further Responses
            If
the party demanding inspection, on receipt of a response to an inspection
demand, deems that (1) a statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete,
(2) a representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or
evasive, or (3) an objection in the response is without merit or too general,
that party may move for an order compelling further response to the
demand.  CCP §2031.310.  
            The
moving party on a motion to compel further responses to a production demand
bears the initial burden of demonstrating “good cause” for discovery of the
requested information.  CCP
§2031.310(b)(1).  This burden is met by a
demonstration (a) that the responsive documents contain information which is
relevant to the subject matter of the action, and (b) of specific facts
indicating the information is necessary. 
See Glenfed Development Corp. v. Superior Court, (1997) 53
Cal. App. 4th 1113, 1117. 
Good cause is normally established by submission of a declaration made
on “information and belief.”  Weil &
Brown, Civil Procedure Before Trial, (2000) 8:1495. 8H-26; See Grannis
v. Board of Medical Examiners, (1971) 19 Cal. App. 3d 551, 564.  Good cause may be found to justify discovery
where specific facts show that the discovery is necessary for effective trial
preparation or to prevent surprise at trial. 
Associated Brewers Dist. Co. v. Superior Court (1967) 65 Cal.3d
583, 588.  So, where there is no
privilege issue or claim of attorney work product, the burden to show good
cause is met by a fact-specific showing of relevance.  Glenfed Development Corp. v. Superior
Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117. 
Once good cause is shown, the burden shifts to the opposing party to
justify any objections or failure to fully respond.  Coy v. Superior Court, (1962) 58
Cal.2d 210, 220-21.  
            Unless
notice of the motion is given within 45 days of the service of the response, or
any supplemental response, or on or before any specific later date to which the
propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the
propounding party waives any right to compel further response to requests for
production.  CCP §§2031.310(c).
            The
motion must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under CCP section 2016.040.  CCP §2031.310(b)(1).  The motion shall be accompanied by a separate
document which sets forth each demand to which a further response is requested,
the response given, and the factual and legal reasons for compelling it. CRC
3.1345(a)(2).  The separate statement
must be full and complete so that no person is required to review any other
document in order to determine the full request and the full response.  CRC 3.1345(c). Material must not be
incorporated by reference.  CRC 3.1345(c).

            The
court shall impose a monetary sanction under CCP section 2023.010 against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a further response to an inspection demand, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.  CCP §2030.310(h).
 
            2.
Privilege Log
            If an
objection is based on a claim of privilege or a claim that the information
sought is protected work product, the response shall provide sufficient factual
information for other parties to evaluate the merits of that claim, including,
if necessary, a privilege log.  CCP
§2031.240(c)(1).  The Discovery Act has
codified the concept of a privilege log as that term is used in California case
law.  CCP §2031.240(c)(2). 
            A
privilege claimant has the initial burden of proving the preliminary facts to
show the privilege applies.  Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc.,
(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 596.  The purpose of a privilege log is to
provide a specific factual description of documents in aid of substantiating a
claim of privilege in connection with a request for document production.  Catalina
Island Yacht Club v. Superior Court, (“Catalina”) (2015) 242
Cal.App.4th 1116, 1125.  The purpose of providing a specific factual
description of documents is to permit a judicial evaluation of the claim of
privilege.  Id. at 1125.  
            The court
in Catalina held that the precise information required for an adequate
privilege log will vary from case to case based on the privileges asserted and
the underlying circumstances.  Id. at 1130.  In general,
however, a privilege log should provide the identity and capacity of all
individuals who authored, sent, or received each allegedly privileged document,
the document’s date, a brief description of the document, and its contents or
subject matter sufficient to determine whether the privilege applies, and the
precise privilege or protection asserted.  Id. 
 
            C. Statement of Facts
            1. PLPU’s Evidence[1]
            a. Initial RFP Response
            On September 12, 2023,
PLPU propounded RFPs.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶2,
Ex. 1.
            On October 16, 2023, the
City responded to the RFPs.  Bojeaux
Decl., ¶3, Ex. 2.[2]  After a prefatory statement, it objected to
every RFP at issue as compound.  Bojeaux
Decl., ¶3, Ex. 2.  It also objected to RFP
Nos. 3-7 and 12-13 as vague and ambiguous, RFP Nos. 3-13 and 19-20 as
irrelevant, RFP Nos. 10-13 as overbroad in time and scope, RFP Nos. 19-20 as
overbroad, RFP Nos. 12-13 as lacking foundation, and RFP Nos. 3-11 and 16-20 as
protected under the attorney-client privilege and attorney work product
doctrine.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶3, Ex. 2.
            As to relevance of RFP
Nos. 2-9, the City argued that the only relevant question was whether the description
of Item E-6 on the January 24, 2023 agenda complied with the Brown Act.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶3, Ex. 2.  Any information about the drafting process
was therefore irrelevant.  Bojeaux Decl.,
¶3, Ex. 2.  As to RFP Nos. 3-7, they were
vague and ambiguous because the City cannot have “thought” anything because it
is an entity and not an individual.  Bojeaux
Decl., ¶3, Ex. 2.  RFP Nos. 12-13 were
vague and ambiguous because they asked about the “interest” and “desire” of a
third party.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶3, Ex.
2.  
            Without waiving the
objections, the City agreed to produce documents responsive to RFP Nos. 3 and 8-9.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶3, Ex. 2.  It also agreed to produce documents
responsive to RFP Nos. 10-11 dated on or after January 1, 2022.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶3, Ex. 2.  It produced the agendas for City Council
meetings on November 15 and December 6, 2022 but asserted no other
non-privileged documents were responsive to RFP Nos. 16-17.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶3, Ex. 2.  
            The City asserted that it
could not produce documents responsive to RFP Nos. 4-7 without clarification.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶3, Ex. 2.  It did not respond to RFP Nos. 12-13 or 19-20
beyond the objections.  Bojeaux Decl.,
¶3, Ex. 2.
            Also on October 16,
2023, the City produced a privilege log listing 45 documents protected as
either attorney-client communications, attorney work product, or closed session
materials under Govt. Code section 54956.8. 
Bojeaux Decl., ¶4, Ex. 3.  The
privilege log did not explain which documents would otherwise be responsive to
which RFPs.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶4, Ex.
3.  Privileged documents include attorney/client
communications and work product notes by Stephanie Cao (“Cao”) dated November
5, 2022 (No. 6) and December 6, 2022 (No. 7), an email chain about
closed session reports from Logan Phillippo (“Phillippo”) to Ryan Gohlich
(“Gohlich”) on June 23, 2023 at 8:47 a.m. (No. 25), and an email chain about
closed session reports from Gohlich to Phillippo later that day at 1:07 p.m. (No.
26).  Bojeaux Decl., ¶4, Ex. 3.
              On October 18, 2023, PLPU asked the City to
explain which of the produced documents were responsive to which RFPs.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶6.  The City’s response on October 23, 2023
showed that documents were responsive to only RFP Nos. 2-3, 8-11, 14-15, and
18.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶6, Ex. 4.
 
            b. Communications
            On October 30, 2023, PLPU
emailed the City about its refusal to properly respond to RFP Nos. 4-7, 16-17,
and 19-20.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶7, Ex. 5.  PLPU asserted that the City violated the SLA
by negotiating with UTA in closed agenda sessions before it issued an SLD and
dealt with housing providers.  Bojeaux
Decl., ¶7, Ex. 5.  It then realized it
could not enter a proper SLD because the Property was used for a City
purpose.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶7, Ex. 5.  
            The City did not want
residents to weigh in on the Property’s use because they would oppose leasing
or selling it to UTA.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶7,
Ex. 5.  It also did not want residents to
know of the blunder in hopes that the City could move forward with leasing the
Property to the UTA before an unsuspecting public.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶7, Ex. 5.  City agents therefore obfuscated their
intentions with a deceptive agenda item description and placed the matter on
the consent calendar.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶7,
Ex. 5.  
            The October 30 email noted
that, when PLPU applied for a TRO, the court chose not to act because City
personnel had not acted on the Declaration. 
Bojeaux Decl., ¶7, Ex. 5.  The
City has since complied with required procedures based on the fraudulent Declaration,
without negotiating with affordable housing providers.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶7, Ex. 5.  The RFPs at issue sought to demonstrate the
City’s motivation.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶7,
Ex. 5.  PLPU then outlined how each RFP
was relevant.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶7, Ex.
5.  
            On October 31, 2023, PLPU
sent City an email regarding its response to RFP Nos. 16-17.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶8, Ex. 6.  The City had asserted the only non-privileged
documents responsive to those RFPs were the closed session agendas for November
15 and December 6, 2022 City Council meetings. 
Bojeaux Decl., ¶8.  The privilege
log had asserted that Govt. Code section 54956.8 protects Privilege Log Nos.
6-7 as closed session materials.  Bojeaux
Decl., ¶8, Ex. 6.  However, PLPU’s October
31 email asserted that Govt. Code section 54956.8 does not protect closed
session materials from production in litigation under a confidentiality
agreement.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶8, Ex. 6.  It also noted that although the privilege log
labeled these documents as attorney notes, these notes could also include
minutes of the closed sessions meeting or unprivileged documents from the
closed session packets.  Bojeaux Decl.,
¶8, Ex. 6.  
            The October 31 email
also asked why Privilege Log Nos. 25-26, email chains about closed session
reports, remain confidential when they do not involve communication with legal
counsel.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶8, Ex. 6.  PLPU argued they should be produced per the parties’
confidentiality stipulation (“Stipulation”). 
Bojeaux Decl., ¶8, Ex. 6.  
            On November 2, 2023, PLPU
asked the City to identify which of the documents in the privilege log apply to
which RFPs.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶9, Ex. 7.  
            On November 9, 2023, PLPU
asked to meet and confer regarding the substance of four emails it had
previously sent.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶10, Ex.
8.  PLPU explained it needed to draft
motions to compel further responses on any unresolved issues by the November 16
deadline the court had set.  Bojeaux
Decl., ¶10, Ex. 8.
            On November 12, 2023,
the City responded to the meet and confer email.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶11, Ex. 9.  PLPU responded later that day.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶12, Ex. 10.  
            On November 13, 2023, the
parties met and conferred over the telephone about the various concerns with
the RFPs and City’s responses.  Bojeaux
Decl., ¶13, Ex. 11.  An email after the
conversation memorialized the substance thereof.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶13, Ex. 11.  
 
            e. Attorney’s Fees and Costs
            Counsel for PLPU spent over
3.5 hours drafting the emails prior to November 12, 2023, 40 minutes reviewing
the City’s November 12 email, 1.5 hours drafting the November 12 email, 1.25
hours on the telephonic meet and confer, 20 minutes to draft the November 13,
2023 email memorializing it, and 15 hours to prepare the moving papers for this
motion.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶14.  PLPU’s counsel expects to spend another hour preparing
for the motion, plus one more reviewing the tentative and attending the hearing,
for a total of 24 hours.  Bojeaux Decl.,
¶14. 
            Based on 36 years of
trial and appellate experience, counsel for PLPU’s $350 hourly rate is
reasonable.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶14.  PLPU’s attorney’s fees total 24 x $350 =
$8,400.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶14.  PLPU also will incur about $100 in costs
related to this motion, for a total of $8,500. 
Bojeaux Decl., ¶14.  
 
            2.
The City’s Evidence
            When
the City responded to the RFPs on October 16, 2023, it sent a privilege log and
a link to responsive documents Bates-stamped from 651 to 1143.  Giovinco Decl., ¶2, Ex. A.  The same email explained that because a
Paralegal Manager became ill and had to leave early, counsel still needed to
confirm the status of some redacted items for production.  Giovinco Decl., ¶3, Ex. A.  This included whether they were already
listed on the privilege log or needed to be added.  Giovinco Decl., ¶3, Ex. A.  Counsel expected to complete this by the next
day, but the Paralegal Manager was out sick then as well.  Giovinco Decl., ¶3, Ex. A.  
            On
October 18, 2023, the City produced additional documents Bates-stamped from 1144
to 1192.  Giovinco Decl., ¶4, Ex. A.  It also sent an updated privilege log adding
nine partially redacted documents.  Giovinco
Decl., ¶5, Exs. A-B.
            The
City was never amenable to producing documents relating to RFP Nos. 12-13 over
a nine-year timespan.  Giovinco Decl., ¶11.  During the November 13, 2023 meet and confer,
the City suggested a timeframe from January 2022 to the date of the lawsuit,
without conceding that was appropriate.  Giovinco
Decl., ¶11.  PLPU refused to agree to
anything less than a 13-year span.  Giovinco
Decl., ¶11.  
            On
November 25, 2023, the court signed the Stipulation between the parties as to
confidential documents.  Giovinco Decl.,
¶12, Ex. C.  
            On
January 17, 2024, the parties continued meet-and-confer efforts via a one-hour
meeting in person to discuss the City’s objections to the demands in this
motion to compel.  Giovinco Decl., ¶8.  The parties continued to dispute the
relevance of RFPs 3-7, 12-13, 16-17, and 19-20 based on the limited scope of
the case.  Giovinco Decl., ¶9.  They discussed the scope of RFP Nos. 4-7,
which PLPU still wanted to include documents reflecting the thoughts of unnamed
staff as well as City attorneys.  Giovinco
Decl., ¶9.  As to RFPs 12-13, the City
rejected PLPU’s suggested seven-year timeframe for the same reasons it rejected
a 13-year timeframe.  Giovinco Decl., ¶9.  PLPU also continued to request confidential
and privileged documents subject to the attorney-client communication and
attorney work product privileges, communications with third parties for at
least the last seven years, and additional information regarding the privilege
log.  Giovinco Decl., ¶9.  
            The
City has never engaged in gamesmanship or otherwise used the discovery process
for an improper purpose.  Giovinco Decl.,
¶13.  It timely responded to multiple
rounds of discovery with specific and detailed responses, and objections
supported by case authority, thousands of pages of documents, and detailed
privilege logs.  Giovinco Decl.,
¶13.  This dispute arose from the City’s
good-faith, reasoned understanding of the law surrounding the relevant issues.  Giovinco Decl., ¶13.  
 
            3. Reply Evidence
            Although the City
produced 2,500 pages of documents, most were duplicates because people often
copied prior emails to several other people. 
Bojeaux Reply Decl., ¶5.  If the
City was not trying to hide things, it would have produced the documents it
understood PLPU wanted and indicated which privilege log entries relate to
which RFPs.  Bojeaux Reply Decl., ¶6.  
 
            b. UTA
            In emails from late
March 2023, UTA said the City has indicated it was required to offer the
Property as housing.  Bojeaux Reply
Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  Depending on where
that “ended up,” the City had said that it could reengage with UTA in the
latter half of 2023.  Bojeaux Reply
Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  UTA now asked when the
City thought this reengagement could occur. 
Bojeaux Reply Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.
            Two days later, the City
explained the 60-day period for certain agencies to express interest in the
Property would expire on April 11, 2023. 
Bojeaux Reply Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  Because
one entity had expressed interest, the City needed to negotiate with the entity
for at least 90 days, or through July 2023. 
Bojeaux Reply Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  The
City would then have a better understanding of the situation, but the third or
fourth quarter of 2023 still felt like an appropriate estimate for when UTA
discussions would recommence.  Bojeaux
Reply Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  
            PLPU believes the City
does not want to produce documents after the Petition’s filing date.  Bojeaux Reply Decl., ¶4.  These documents would show the City sought to
go through empty motions of negotiating with housing providers per the SLA
before returning to UTA negotiations. 
Bojeaux Reply Decl., ¶4.  
 
            c. Meet and Confer
            On January 18, 2024, the
parties met and conferred about the issues in this motion.  Bojeaux Reply Decl., ¶3.  PLPU memorialized the substance thereof in an
email the next day.  Bojeaux Reply Decl.,
¶3, Ex. 1.  
            
            d. Attorney’s Fees
            Counsel for PLPU spent
an hour to meet and confer in person, one hour of travel time, 0.75 to confirm the
substance of such meet and confer in email format, and over 8 hours to review
the opposition and prepare a reply.  Bojeaux
Reply Decl., ¶7.  These 10.75 hours of
work add $350 x 10.75 = $3,763 to the accrued fees on this motion, for a total
of $8,500 + $3,763 = $12,263.  Bojeaux
Reply Decl., ¶7.  
 
            D. Analysis
            Petitioner
PLPU moves to compel further
responses to RFP Nos. 4-7, 12-13, 16-17, and 19-20, including the production of
Privilege Log Document Nos. 6, 7, 25, and 26 and to compel the City to explain
which of the documents listed in the privilege log are responsive to RFP Nos.
3-11, 16-17, and 19-20.  
 
            1.
Separate Statement
Each motion shall be accompanied by a separate
document which sets forth each demand to which a further response is requested,
the response given, and the factual and legal reasons for compelling it. CRC
3.1345(a)(2).  The separate statement
must be full and complete so that no person is required to review any other
document in order to determine the full request and the full response.  CRC 3.1345(c).  Material must not be incorporated into the
separate statement by reference.  Id.  For each request, the statement must include
(1) the text of the request or interrogatory; (2) the text of each response,
answer, or objection; and (3) a statement of the factual and legal reasons for
compelling further responses, answers, or production.  Material must not be incorporated by
reference.  Id.  
PLPU’s separate statement is non-compliant for RFP
Nos. 5, 6, 7, 13, and 17 because it incorporates its arguments for other RFPs
in violation of CRC 3.1345(c).  As a
result, these demands will not be further considered and only RFP Nos. 4, 16,
19, and 20 will be addressed.[3]
 
            2. Prefatory Statement
            If the responding party to discovery objects to the
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of an item or category of
item, the response shall identify with particularity any document, tangible
thing, land, or electronically stored information falling within any category
of item in the demand to which an objection is being made.  CCP §2031.240(b)(1).  
PLPU asserts that the objections in the prefatory
statement of the City’s response to the RFPs are improper and should be
excluded.  Mot. at 77.  Although the City disputes whether this
statement was improper, it also asserts it did not rely on this statement in
its response to each RFP.  Opp. at
14.  The court need not discuss the
prefatory statement further.  
 
            3. Merits
            a. Relevance and Good Cause
            The Civil Discovery Act applies to
statutory special proceedings that are silent with respect to discovery.  City of Los Angeles v. Superior Court,
(2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 272, 286. 
A trial court may compel discovery if the petitioner makes an
adequate showing that the discovery is likely to aid in the resolution of the
particular issues presented in the proceeding. 
See id. at 289. 
However, the trial court may exercise its conventional authority to
limit discovery as required.  Id.
at 289.  
            In the
absence of contrary court order, a civil litigant’s right to discovery is
broad.  Williams v. Superior Court, (2017) 3 Cal. 5th 531,
541.  The Civil Discovery Act permits discovery regarding
any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in
the pending action or to the determination of any motion made in that action,
if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated
to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  CCP §2017.010. 
Evidence is relevant if it has any tendency in reason to prove or
disprove any disputed fact that is of consequence to the determination of the
action.  Evid. Code §210.
            The motion for an order compelling
further responses to a request for production shall set forth specific facts
showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.  CCP §2031.310(b)(1).  The supporting declarations must show
specific facts rather than conclusions. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. v. Superior
Court, (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1138, 1141 (desire to review documents for
“context” insufficient).  If good cause
is shown, the burden shifts to the responding party to justify any objections made
to document disclosure.  Kirkland v
Superior Court, (202) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.
            RFP No. 4 seeks documents pertaining
to any facts or statements that the City thought should be included or omitted in
agenda Item E-6.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶2, Ex.
1.  The City relies on its objection that
RFPs about agenda drafts are not relevant because the only issue is whether the
final Item E-6 complies with the Brown Act. 
Bojeaux Decl., ¶3, Ex. 2.  Opp. at
8.  In essence, the Citiy contends that
PLPU has not made a fact-specific showing of relevance.  See Glenfed Development Corp. v.
Superior Court, supra, 53 Cal.App.4th at 1117.  
            The Brown Act is codified at Govt. Code section 54950 et seq.  The
purpose of the Brown Act is to ensure the public’s right to attend public
meetings, to facilitate public participation in all phases of local government
decision making, and to curb misuse of the democratic process by secret
legislation of public bodies.  Chaffee v. San Francisco Library
Commission, (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 461.  A major objective of the
Brown Act is to facilitate public participation in all phases of local
government decision making and to curb misuse of democratic process by secret
legislation by public bodies.  Sacramento Newspaper Guild v. Sacramento
County Bd. of Supervisors, (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 41, 50.  The Brown
Act “is a remedial statute that must be construed liberally so as to accomplish
its purpose.”  Shapiro v. Board of Directors, (2005) 134
Cal.App.4th 170, 181 (citing Epstein v. Hollywood Entertainment Dist. II
Bus. Improvement Dist., (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 862, 869).
            PLPU believes Item E-6 was so worded
and listed on a consent calendar to prevent public scrutiny of the
measure.  The Brown Act seeks to prevent
such underhanded lawmaking through transparency requirements.  PLPU contends that RFP No. 4 is relevant to
prove the agenda description was intended to be misleading.  Prior drafts are relevant insofar as changes
between them may reveal whether the City tried to conceal plans to lease the
Property to the UTA.  PLPU has explained
this to the City more than once, and the City has failed to respond to this
argument.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶7, Ex. 5.  RFP No. 4 seeks relevant information.
            RFP
No. 12 seeks any communication between the City and UTA about any interest or
desire UTA had in leasing or purchasing property in the City, including but not
limited to the Property.  Bojeaux
Decl., ¶2, Ex. 1.  The City argues that
this action challenges the City Council’s legislative determination that the
Property is surplus.  As a result, the
Resolution and possibly the accompanying staff report are the only relevant
documents.  No other documents are
relevant to this issue.
            PLPU asserts that the City’s motive was
to lease the Property to UTA when it knew the public would not agree.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶7, Ex. 5.  It presents evidence that UTA wants to
recommence such negotiations after the City finishes mandatory negotiations
with a housing developer.  Bojeaux Reply
Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  Whether UTA was
interested before the January 24, 2023 City Council meeting is relevant to
whether the City had reason to make the Declaration vague and planned to do
so.  RFP No. 12 seeks relevant information.
            RFP
Nos. 19-20 seek information about the City’s use of the Property after the City
Council passed the Resolution, including discussions about the Property at the
June 27, 2023 closed session City Council meeting.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶7, Ex. 5.  The City’s motive in passing the Resolution
and Declaration is relevant.  Any
conversations after their passage are relevant because they reflect the City’s
intent to execute whatever plans motivated the decision to begin with.  RFP
Nos. 19-20 are relevant.
            The City’s objections based on
relevance lack merit.
 
            b. Vagueness
            An objection for vagueness is
unjustified and evasive when there is ample information that the party
understood the meaning of the term.  See Clement v. Alegre,
(2009), 177 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1286-87. 
            RFP No. 4 asks what the City “thought”
to include or exclude in agenda Item E-6 or the agenda report.   Bojeaux
Decl., ¶2, Ex. 1.  The City argues that this
was vague and ambiguous because the City is an entity, not an individual and it
could not produce documents responsive without clarification.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶3, Ex. 2.
            PLPU later asserted the City “does
its thinking through its agents and employees.” 
Bojeaux Decl., ¶7, Ex. 5.  The
City responded that its official legislative body is the City Council and what other
individual employees think is irrelevant.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶11, Ex. 9.  The City now argues that it cannot reasonably
ascertain what every agent and employee “thought” should be included in the agenda
description or report.  When it attempted
to limit the list of relevant employees during meet-and-confer efforts on January
17, 2024, PLPU still wanted documents reflecting the thoughts of unnamed staff
as well as City attorneys.  Giovinco
Decl., ¶9.
            PLPU asserts that based on the
context, it was easily understood that the RFP used the word “City” to refer to
employees responsible for drafting the agenda description or report.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶11.  Reply at 5. 
The court agrees.  
            RFP Nos. 12-13 seek any
communication between the City and UTA about any interest or desire UTA had in
leasing or purchasing property in the City. 
Bojeaux Decl., ¶2, Ex. 1.  The
City argues that it cannot determine the interest or desire of a third party
like UTA.  Opp. at 12.  
            Not so.  Documents that include statements from the UTA
reflect its intent.  For example, PLPU
has submitted an email from UTA asking the City about when they can resume
negotiations to rent the Property.  Bojeaux
Reply Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  This email makes
it clear UTA intends to rent the Property.  
            The objections based on vagueness lack
merit.
 
            c. Scope and Undue Burden
            Burden is inherent in all demands
for discovery.  West Pico Furniture Co. v. Superior Court (1961) 56
Cal.2d 407, 417.  There is always a burden in a search and
production.  See Alpine Mutual Water Co. v. Superior Court,
(1968) 259 Cal.App.2d 45, 55.  To support an undue burden objection, there
must be some showing that the ultimate effect of the burden is incommensurate
with the result sought.  Id. at 417.  In deciding the issue,
the court has a discretionary power to grant in part and deny in part, balance
the equities, including costs, and to balance the purpose and need for the
information against the burden which production entails.  Id. 
See Mead Reinsurance Co. v. Superior Court, (“Mead”) (1986) 188 Cal. App. 3d
313, 318, 320-21 (denying motion to compel when defendants had demonstrated
that a response would have required manual evaluation of over 13,000 open files
and cost the company thousands to hire and train personnel). 
            RFP Nos. 12-13 do not include a timeframe
for which the City should search for responsive documents.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶2, Ex. 1.  Opp. at 12. 
PLPU’s November 13 email memorializing a telephonic meet and confer asserted
that PLPU offered to limit the timespan to 13 years, the tenure of the most
senior Councilmembers supporting the Resolution.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶13, Ex. 11.  The City asked PLPU to limit RFP No. 12 and
13 to nine years, ending on February 1, 2023 even though PLPU asserted the City
and UTA continued discussing the Property after that date.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶13, Ex. 11.  
            The City denies that it ever offered
to produce responsive documents over a nine-year timespan.  Giovinco Decl., ¶11.  It offered a timeframe from January 2022 to
the date of the lawsuit, without conceding that was appropriate.  Giovinco Decl., ¶11.  On January 17, 2024, it rejected PLPU ‘s
suggested seven-year timeframe for the same reasons it rejected a 13-year
timeframe.  Giovinco Decl., ¶9.  
            PLPU explains that it did not want
to limit the scope because it wants to show a longstanding dialogue between UTA
and the City.  Mot. at 75.  This dialogue continued after the City passed
the Resolution, when UTA asked via email for an estimated date by which reengagement
on the issue could occur.  Bojeaux Reply
Decl., ¶4, Ex. 2.  As discussed above, the
Petition alleges the City violated the SLA so it could lease the Property to
UTA.  This motive can pre-date the
adoption of the SLA in 2019.
            The City’s evidence does not describe
the burden it would face if forced to produce these documents.  PLPU cites Mead Reinsurance Co. v.
Superior Court, (1986) 188 Cal. App. 3d 313, 321, which requires the
non-propounding party to show that the ultimate effect of the burden is
incommensurate with the result sought. 
Reply at 6.  The City has not
shown an undue burden.
            Nonetheless, PLPU fails to show good
cause for the production of an entire 13-year period of documents simply to
show a longstanding relationship between the City and UTA.  The court also has discretion to limit
discovery.  CCP §2019.030(a)(2); Mead,
supra, 188 Cal. App. 3d at 321.  Because
the City’s relationship with UTA is relevant only as to motive, PLPU cannot
justify reviewing 13 years of communications between UTA and the City.  Although there is nothing significant about
the SLA’s adoption in 2019, limiting production to the five-year period after
its passage is reasonable.
            The City asserts that RFP Nos. 19-20
are overbroad because they seek documents post-dating the lawsuit, which cannot
be relevant.  Opp. at 13.  As discussed, post-lawsuit documents can
demonstrate that the intention to lease the Property has survived the
Resolution and influenced its adoption.  
            The scope of RFP Nos. 12-13 is
limited to documents after the SLA’s adoption in 2019.  The scope of RFP Nos. 19-20 is not overbroad.
 
            d. Compound
            The City objected to every RFP at
issue as compound.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶3,
Ex. 2.  The November 12 emails dispute
whether the use of the word “or” multiple times rendered the RFPs
compound.  Bojeaux Decl., Exs. 9-10.  The City reiterates this argument, noting
that several RFPs being with the phrase “writings that evidence, mention,
discuss, or refer to any facts or statements…” 
Bojeaux Decl., ¶2, Ex. 1.  Opp. at
13.
            The court need not discuss this in
detail.  Special interrogatories may not
contain subparts or a compound, conjunctive, or disjunctive question.  CCP §2030.060(d).  As PLPU notes, no statute creates a similar
constraint for RFPs.  The City admits
that its responses to the RFPs at issue do not rely on this objection.  Opp. at 14.
 
            e. RFP Nos. 16-17
            RFP Nos. 16-17 seek writings
concerning the discussions, conclusions, and decisions relating to the Property
at closed session City Council meetings in December 2022 and June 2023.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶2, Ex. 1.  The City notes that it provided the agenda
for each session while asserting there were no other non-privileged responsive
documents.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶3, Ex.
2.  Opp. at 14-15.  
            PLPU concedes in reply that the
agenda was produced but argues that the City should have produced unprivileged
documents from the closed session packets. 
Reply at 7.  PLPU made this
argument in the October 31 email, noting that the privilege log labeled these
documents as attorney notes and closed session materials protected under Govt.
Code section 54956.8.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶8,
Ex. 6.  This argument therefore concerns
whether PLPU has demonstrated the City should produce any documents listed in
the privilege log.  See post.
 
            f. Privilege Log
            (1) Production of Privilege
Log Documents
            PLPU’s requested relief includes the
production of non-privileged portions of Privilege Log Document Nos. 6-7 and
25-26 listed in the City’s privilege log. 
Mot. at 78.  These include Cao’s attorney/client
communications and work product notes dated November 5 and December 6, 2022,
and emails about closed session reports between Phillippo and Gohlich on June
23, 2023.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶4, Ex. 3.
            The City asserted the documents were
protected as either attorney-client communications, attorney work product, or closed
session materials under Govt. Code section 54956.8.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶4, Ex. 3.  PLPU disputed whether the documents labeled
as attorney notes may also include minutes of the closed sessions meeting or
unprivileged documents from the closed session packets.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶8, Ex. 6.  
            The court need not discuss this issue
in detail.  The memorandum of points and
authorities for this motion (Mot. at 69-78) does not discuss why the court
should compel production Nos. 6-7 and 25-26. 
Opp. at 15.  PLPU asserts in reply
that the separate statement discussed the merits of this argument.  Reply at 7. 
It does not.  Rather, the separate
statement identifies each of Nos. 6-7 and 25-26 and improperly purports to
impermissibly incorporate arguments from other demands.  
            The City is not required to produce Privilege
Log documents Nos. 6-7 and 25-26.
 
            (2) Matching Privileged
Documents with RFPs
            PLPU asserts the City must identify
which documents listed in the privilege log are responsive to which RFPs.  Mot. at 72-73.  
            The City cites Catalina, supra,
242 Cal.App.4th at 1130 which holds that a privilege log should generally provide
the identity and capacity of all individuals who authored, sent, or received
each allegedly privileged document, the document’s date, a brief description of
the document, and its contents or subject matter sufficient to determine
whether the privilege applies, and the precise privilege or protection
asserted.   Opp. at 10.  The City’s privilege log includes this
information, and the City asserts it needs nothing else.  Id. 

            The City’s argument ignores Catalina’s
larger holding that a specific log might need will vary based on the privileges
asserted and the underlying circumstances. 
Catalina, supra, 242 Cal.App.4th at 1130.
            The City argues that PLPU is unable
to cite any case authority beyond “common sense” to support its position.  Opp. at 11. 
PLPU need not cite case law when the statute is clear about the nature of
privilege logs.  The Discovery Act has
codified the concept of a privilege log as that term is used in California case
law.  CCP §2031.240(c)(2).  The response to an RFP must provide
sufficient factual information for other parties to evaluate the merits of any
claim of privilege or protected work product. 
CCP §2031.240(c)(1).  The
responding party must provide a separate response to each RFP, including objections
of privilege.  CCP §2031.210(a)(3).  
            Based on this statutory scheme, when
discovery responses take the form of a privilege log, the log must be divisible
into responses for each discovery request to be compliant with CCP section 2031.210(a).  The City must identify which items on the
privilege log respond to which RFPs.
 
            4. Sanctions
            The court shall impose a monetary
sanction against any party or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.  CCP §2031.310(h).
            PLPU seeks sanctions of $12,263, the
total attorneys’ fees it incurred through this motion.  Bojeaux Decl., ¶14; Bojeaux Reply Decl., ¶7.  The City asserts sanctions are not warranted
because it did not engage in gamesmanship or otherwise used the discovery
process for an improper purpose. 
Giovinco Decl., ¶13.  Opp. at
17.  It timely responded to multiple
rounds of discovery with specific and detailed responses, and objections
supported by case authority, thousands of pages of documents, and detailed
privilege logs.  Giovinco Decl., ¶13.  This dispute arose from the City’s
good-faith, reasoned understanding of the law surrounding the relevant
issues.  Giovinco Decl., ¶13.  
            Some of the City’s actions during
the meet and confer process undermine this argument.  For example, on November 13, 2023, the City
offered to produce documents responsive to RFP Nos. 12-13 from January 2022 to
the date of the lawsuit.  Giovinco Decl.,
¶11.  If there was no dispute as to
production for this period, the City should have produced some responsive
documents while the parties negotiated as to beyond this timeframe.  The City instead chose to withhold any
documents that could be responsive.  Bojeaux
Decl., ¶3, Ex. 2.  
            The City has not acted with
substantial justification.  On the other
hand, PLPU has not prevailed on all the issues. 
The City’s failures are sufficient to warrant sanctions, albeit
reduced.  Sanctions of $5,000 are imposed.
 
            E. Conclusion
            The motion to compel further
responses is granted in part.  Within ten
days, the City is ordered to produce further responses to RFP
Nos. 4, 16, 19, and 20 without objection. 
For the privilege log, the City is ordered to show which
documents described in the log correspond to which RFPs.  Sanctions are granted in the amount of $5,000,
payable within 30 days and collectible as a judgment.
