would be untimely as filed more than 45 days after such response.  CCP §§ 2030.300(c), 3031.310(c).

The City also is correct that PCLU’s separate statement does not contain a
statement of facts, concise statement of the law, evidence and arguments relied
on (Opp. at 7), but the court will not deny the other RFPs on that basis.
