And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case Hannley, et al. v. Mann, et al., Case No. 23SMCV01268. Defendant Cabo has filed a demurrer to the third amended complaint (TAC) and a motion to strike portions of the complaint. The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, finding that the allegations against Cabo are insufficient to establish conspiracy or alter ego liability. The judge has also found that the allegations against Cabo are not based on any alleged conduct by his company, Alternate Health (AH), but rather on a package allegedly sent by defendant Blaine Labs, AH's subsidiary. The judge has concluded that the motion to strike is moot since the demurrer has been sustained without leave to amend.
