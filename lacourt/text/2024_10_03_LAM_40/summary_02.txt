And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motion to seal limited portions of the Complaint and First Amended Complaint is granted. The motion is to seal two sections of the Complaint and First Amended Complaint, which contain information about "allegations by the State Bar" learned by the lawyer during representation. The judge finds that there is an overriding interest in protecting confidential attorney-client information, which outweighs the right of public access to the information. The judge orders the plaintiff to file a redacted version of the Complaint and First Amended Complaint, redacting the specified portions, within five court days.
