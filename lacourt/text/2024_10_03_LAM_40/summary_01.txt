And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Wawanesa General Insurance Company's motion for summary judgment, finding that there is no triable issue of material fact regarding the "Duties After An Accident Or A Loss" condition of the policy. The court denied Wawanesa's motion for summary judgment as to the "Fraud and Misrepresentation" condition of the policy, finding that there is a dispute of material fact.

The case involves a dispute between Wawanesa and defendants Cheryl Lyn Martinez and Joyce Robles over insurance coverage. Wawanesa alleges that the defendants breached the terms of the policy by failing to fully cooperate with Wawanesa's claim investigation and by concealing or misrepresenting material facts.

The court found that Wawanesa has established that the defendants failed to comply with the "Duties After An Accident Or A Loss" condition of the policy, which requires them to cooperate with Wawanesa's claim investigation. However, the court found that there is a dispute of material fact regarding whether the defendants breached the "Fraud and Misrepresentation" condition of the policy.

The judge's ruling grants Wawanesa's motion for summary judgment and declares that the defendants are not entitled to any benefits or coverage under the Wawanesa policy.
