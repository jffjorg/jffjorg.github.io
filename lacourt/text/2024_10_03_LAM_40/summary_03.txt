Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion filed by Defendant Evaristo Rodriguez Gonzalez to set aside the default entered against him on July 29, 2024. The Defendant argues that the default was entered due to his excusable neglect, as he mistakenly believed that his former counsel, Monica Graham, would file an answer on his behalf. The Court finds that this neglect was excusable and grants the motion to set aside the default.

The Court also orders Defendant Gonzalez to remit payment of $1,000.00 to Plaintiff Ivan Rodriguez within 14 calendar days of notice of entry of this Order. Additionally, Defendant Gonzalez is ordered to file his Answer attached to his Declaration as Exhibit 2 within 5 court days.

It is worth noting that the Court has not made a finding on the merits of the case and has only granted the motion to set aside the default. The case is now set to proceed with the filing of the Answer and further proceedings as necessary.
