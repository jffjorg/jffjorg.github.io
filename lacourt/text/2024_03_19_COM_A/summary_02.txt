And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to quash the defendant's deposition subpoena, but with modifications. The plaintiff was a victim of childhood sexual assault and alleges that the defendant, a religious non-profit corporation, is responsible for the abuse. The defendant sought production of the plaintiff's police records, including criminal history records, but the plaintiff argued that the subpoena was overbroad and infringed on their privacy rights.

The judge found that the plaintiff had established a privacy interest in their criminal history records and that the defendant had not shown that the records were directly relevant to the plaintiff's claims. However, the judge also noted that the plaintiff had implicitly waived their right to privacy with respect to their 1992 felony conviction for grand theft auto, which was disclosed in response to an interrogatory.

The judge modified the subpoena to limit the production of records to those related to the 1992 felony conviction and directed compliance with the modified subpoena. The judge also noted that the defendant had not established the direct relevance of the plaintiff's entire criminal history and that speculation as to what the records may contain was not enough to meet the threshold burden.
