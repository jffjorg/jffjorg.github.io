And here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for judgment against Seiko Epson Corporation. The plaintiff alleges that he was racially profiled, targeted, and harassed by a manager named Rodger while working at Seiko Epson Corporation, and that his reputation was damaged as a result. The plaintiff filed a complaint and a motion for judgment, which was previously denied by the court. Epson America, Inc. filed its answer to the complaint on March 1, 2024. The court finds that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient authority to support a default judgment against Epson, which has answered the amended pleading. The court also notes that the plaintiff's claims are not viable because the amended pleading is defective and the plaintiff has not cured the defects as ordered by the court. The court concludes that the plaintiff's request for judgment is denied.
