And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration, ordering the case to be stayed pending the results of the arbitration. The judge finds that the arbitration provision in the Retail Installment Sale Contract (RISC) is enforceable by the nonsignatory defendant, relying on the case of Felisilda v. FCA US LLC. The judge notes that the arbitration provision explicitly extends to third-party nonsignatories, and that the manufacturer was clearly intended to benefit from the arbitration agreement. The judge also notes that the California Supreme Court has recently granted review of the Ford Motor Warranty Cases (Ochoa), which may clarify the issue. The judge sets a status review/OSC re: dismissal for December 16, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., and is willing to stay the entire case, including the final ruling on this motion, until the California Supreme Court issues its ruling in Ochoa, if the parties are agreeable.
