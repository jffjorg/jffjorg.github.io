 Case Number:  23VECV02824    Hearing Date:   October 23, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV02824 JORGE ALVAREZ ROCHOA, et al. vs AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR  Tentative ruling: Motion to Stay-Grant.  The court grants a complete stay of this action which tolls the running of the 5 year time to try the case. Rodriguez v. FCA US LLC (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 209 (review granted on July 13, 2022) is pending before the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court of California granted review of this case in which the issue, also an issue in this case, is whether the Song-Beverly Act’s express warranty provisions apply to consumers who purchase used vehicles sold with a balance of the manufacturer’s original warranty.  The Supreme Court issued the following order on 7/15/2024: "Pending review, the opinion of the Court of Appeal, which is currently published at 77 Cal.App.5th 209, may be cited, not only for its persuasive value, but also for the limited purpose of establishing the existence of a conflict in authority that would in turn allow trial courts to exercise discretion under Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court (1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 456, to choose between sides of any such conflict. The requests for an order directing depublication of the opinion are denied. (S274625)" Accordingly, staying this action until Rodriguez is resolved and a final decision rendered will further the goals of judicial efficiency and economy.  It is for this reason the court issues the complete stay. Non appearance re review of status of Rodriguez is set for ___________________. Clerk to give notice
