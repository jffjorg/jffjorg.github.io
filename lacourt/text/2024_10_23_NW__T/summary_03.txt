And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the first amended complaint is overruled. The judge has also granted the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages from the first, second, third, and fourth causes of action, but denied the motion to strike punitive damages from the fifth cause of action for concealment fraud. The judge has ordered the defendant to file an answer within 20 days.

The judge's ruling is based on the facts alleged in the first amended complaint, which allege that the defendant had exclusive knowledge of a transmission defect and failed to disclose it to the plaintiff. The judge has held that these allegations are sufficient to state a claim for concealment fraud and that the plaintiff has sufficiently pled a fraud, as defined under Civil Code section 3294.

The judge has also held that punitive damages are not a permitted remedy under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, but that they may be available under Civil Code section 3294 for the concealment fraud cause of action.
