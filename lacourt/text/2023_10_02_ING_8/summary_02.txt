**English Summary:**

The Judge is issuing a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the Plaintiffs, David R. Zimmerman, et al. against the Defendants, Jay H. Zimmerman and Thomas B. Zimmerman. The Plaintiffs are seeking to compel the Defendants to fully comply with discovery requests, including providing verified written responses and documents, and potentially face sanctions for non-compliance.

The Court previously ordered the Defendants to provide these materials by September 15, 2023, but the Plaintiffs claim this order wasn't fully met.  Furthermore, the Plaintiffs allege the produced documents were formatted in a way that made them difficult to review and organize.

At the upcoming hearing, the Judge will hear oral arguments from the Defendants' counsel regarding these allegations. Specifically, the Judge wants to understand:

1. Why the Defendants didn't provide the required responses and privilege log by the deadline.
2. If this issue has been resolved since the deadline.
3. Why the documents were produced in a way that seems intentionally obstructive.
4. Whether the Defendants acknowledge that the Plaintiffs will need to spend $1,400 to properly organize the documents.
5. What sanctions, if any, are appropriate given the alleged discovery misuse. 


The Judge may impose monetary sanctions on the Defendants if they find their actions were intentional and obstructive to the discovery process.

The court will also consider imposing monetary sanctions given the apparent deliberate tactics by the defendants.
