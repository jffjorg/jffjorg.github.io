Code, § 452(d).) DISCUSSION            Defendant demurs to the FAC, arguing that it fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain.             The Court has reviewed the FAC and finds that it is uncertain.  While Plaintiffs have checked the boxes off in section 10 of the form complaint that they seek to allege causes of action for general negligence, premises liability, and harassment of tenants in violation of Civil Code, § 1940.2, they have not pled any of the causes of action separately with supporting facts.  Plaintiffs should comply with the Code of Civil Procedure to draft a coherent complaint with the proper headings of the causes of action they seek to assert and the factual allegations to support each cause of action. As currently alleged, the FAC is uncertain.            The demurrer is sustained with leave to amend. CONCLUSION AND ORDER            Defendant Masis Khodaverdian’s demurrer to the amended complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
