And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses a motion to compel further responses to a request for production, set one (RPD) from the defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc. The plaintiffs, Tania Murrieta and Jose Murrieta Garcia, seek to compel the defendant to provide further responses to three requests: RPD No. 20, which seeks all scripts and flow charts used in handling California consumer requests for a vehicle repurchase or replacement since 2018; RPD No. 43, which seeks documents evidencing complaints by owners of 2019 Honda Odyssey vehicles regarding any of the complaints for which the subject vehicle was presented for repair; and RPD No. 45, which seeks all documents produced in connection with the Browning case, a class-action lawsuit filed in the Northern District of California.

The court grants the motion to compel further responses to RPD No. 20, but limits the scope of the request to all scripts and flow charts used in handling the vehicle at issue in this case. The court denies the motion to compel further responses to RPD Nos. 43 and 45, finding that these requests are overbroad and not relevant to this action.

The court also notes that the defendant did not request sanctions in connection with its opposition brief, and therefore denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $2,125. Finally, the court concludes that the motion to compel further responses to RPD Nos. 20, 43, and 45 is denied, and that no sanctions shall be awarded on this motion.
