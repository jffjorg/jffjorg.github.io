Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrers to the 3rd, 4th, and 7th causes of action, and also sustains the demurrer to the 8th cause of action without leave to amend. The judge also grants the motion to strike portions of the complaint as moot. The ruling is based on the allegations in the complaint and the laws and cases cited. The judge finds that the allegations do not support claims of strict products liability, breach of warranty, negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress against the defendant. The judge will hear oral argument as to whether leave to amend should be granted as to the 7th and 8th causes of action.
