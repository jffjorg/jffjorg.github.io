And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by self-represented litigants Victoria Goring and Carson Goring against Masis Khodaverdian and has found it to be uncertain. The FAC lacks sufficient facts to support each cause of action and fails to plead them separately. The judge has granted defendant's request for judicial notice of certain documents. As a result, the judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, giving the defendant 20 days to re-file a revised complaint. The judge emphasizes the importance of drafting a coherent complaint with proper headings and factual allegations to support each cause of action.
