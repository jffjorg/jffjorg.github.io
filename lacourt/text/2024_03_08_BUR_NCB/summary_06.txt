And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to amend a default judgment. The plaintiff, Blue Bridge Financial, LLC, claims that the default judgment entered on September 12, 2023, is incomplete because it omitted Attachment 7. The attachment is necessary to provide details about the collateral listed in the judgment. The plaintiff's counsel, Martin Hoffmann, states that the office submitted a request for entry of default judgment, but Attachment 7 was not included. The Court grants the motion and orders the plaintiff to submit an amended default judgment with the proposed Attachment 7 document.
