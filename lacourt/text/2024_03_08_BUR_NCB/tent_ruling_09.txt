Shraibati, Esq. and BD&J (“Counsel”), moves to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Lesly Quintana Santos (“Plaintiff”). Counsel filed this instant motion to be relieved as counsel on February 9, 2024.  Counsel has filed the requisite forms pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1362. According to the declaration of Counsel, Counsel seeks to be relieved as counsel because there has been a significant breakdown in the attorney-client relationship such that Counsel is no longer able to effectively prosecute this action and represent Plaintiff’s interest.  Counsel states that this has resulted in irreconcilable differences that make the ogling representation impossible.   (MC-052, §2.)  For these reasons, Counsel seeks to withdraw from representing Plaintiff in this action. Counsel properly served Plaintiff at her last known mailing address.  Counsel states that they have been unable to confirm the address, but made efforts by mailing the motion papers to Plaintiff’s last known address, return receipt requested, and by calling Plaintiff’s last known telephone number(s).  (No proof of service of the summons and complaint on Defendant has been filed.)As for future hearing dates, the Case Management Conference is set for June 24, 2024.  Thus, there is sufficient time for Plaintiff to obtain substitute counsel.Accordingly, the motion to be relieved as counsel is granted.  The order electronically lodged by Counsel will be signed at the hearing.  The order will become effective upon the filing of a proof of service of a signed copy of the order on Plaintiff.
