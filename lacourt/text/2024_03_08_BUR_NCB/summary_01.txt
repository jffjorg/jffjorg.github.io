Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Douglas Peter Richter's motion for reconsideration of the Court's January 19, 2024 order granting Plaintiff Ariella Lousky's motion to deem the requests for admission (RFAs) admitted. The Defendant argues that the Court should reconsider its order because his opposition brief to the RFA motion was accepted by the Court for filing, but the Court did not consider his opposition brief prior to the hearing. The Judge finds that the Defendant's opposition brief was untimely filed, but the Defendant did provide responses to the RFAs prior to the hearing date. Therefore, the Judge grants the Defendant's motion for reconsideration and denies Plaintiff's motion to deem the RFAs admitted. The Judge also maintains the sanctions imposed in the amount of $560 on the RFA motion.
