And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a motion by counsel for Plaintiff Northern Resources, Inc. to withdraw as counsel. The motion was opposed by Defendant Capitol Indemnity Corporation, which argued that the motion should be continued until after the hearings on Defendant's special motion to strike and demurrer. The judge found that "good cause" had been demonstrated by Counsel and that there was no obvious prejudice to Defendant if Counsel was relieved at this time. The judge granted the motion to be relieved, but with conditions: Counsel must submit a new order indicating that the next hearing will be an OSC re; Striking of Answer on a date to be determined, and if Plaintiff does not have a new attorney of record by that date, its complaint may be stricken. Any necessary continuances of the demurrer and anti-SLAPP motion necessitated by this ruling will be addressed when ruling on Plaintiff's pending ex parte motion to continue those hearings.
