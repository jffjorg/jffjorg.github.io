And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment. The Defendant, Roy Wolfe III as Trustee of the Roy Wolfe III Revocable Living Trust, had argued that he did not have actual notice of the lawsuit and therefore should be allowed to set aside the default judgment. However, the Judge found that the Defendant had been personally served with the summons and complaint on June 10, 2024, and that his declaration was self-serving and lacked corroboration. The Judge also noted that the Defendant had failed to demonstrate any mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect that would warrant relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b).

Additionally, the Judge found that the Defendant's claim that he was not served with process was untruthful and that he had followed the same path of self-destruction as the defendant in the related case, Brandi Linton. The Judge noted that the transfer of property from Brandi Linton to the Trust was a fraudulent transfer and that granting the Defendant relief would serve no legitimate purpose.

The Judge also denied the Defendant's objections to the notice of related case and his purported inability to file a peremptory challenge. The Judge noted that the Defendant had been given written notice of the notice of related case and that the Trust had failed to file a peremptory challenge within the time allowed.
