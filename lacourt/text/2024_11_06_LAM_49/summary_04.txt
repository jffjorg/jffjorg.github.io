And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, enjoining Defendants from terminating Plaintiff's lease until trial on the merits or December 31, 2025, whichever comes first. The Judge finds that Plaintiff has a high likelihood of success on the merits of its breach of contract claim, as Plaintiff has established that Defendants breached the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) by failing to extend the lease term. The Judge also finds that Plaintiff has complied with its obligations under the MOU, including providing employee data and assisting in the transfer of licenses.

The Judge orders Plaintiff to file an undertaking in the amount of $10,000, which is a nominal bond amount. The Judge finds that the damages Defendants might sustain in the event the preliminary injunction was improperly issued, if any, is purely speculative, and there is no evidence in the record to establish the extent of the difference between the rent Plaintiff is currently paying and the fair market rental rate.

The Judge's ruling is based on the following findings: (1) the likelihood of success on the merits, (2) the balance of the harms, and (3) the need for a bond. The Judge concludes that the balance of the harms shifts in favor of granting the motion for a preliminary injunction, as Plaintiff faces extreme and potentially irreparable harm if the lease is terminated, while Defendants' harm is less if the preliminary injunction is granted.
