Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Bank of Hope vs. Green Masters Building Service, Inc., et al. (Case Number 23STCV31463). The Judge denies the Plaintiff's default judgment packet and sets a hearing for November 26, 2024, to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or the Plaintiff's counsel sanctioned $250 for failing to enter default judgment. The Judge's decision is based on several reasons, including the lack of an interest calculation provided by the Plaintiff, which is required for breach of contract claims. The Judge also notes that the supplemental declaration of Bo Seong Jang fails to provide the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate, which is the basis for the interest calculation of 15%. The Judge is requiring the Plaintiff to demonstrate why the interest rate is 15% for a breach of contract claim and where the contract provides for a 15% interest rate.
