CARL SHAFF, II, et al.


 Case No.:

 Hearing
  Date:  November 26, 2024



 
Defendants
Stephen Pattillo’s, individually and dba Quality Stamp Shows and OrcoExpo,
Brianna Pattillo’s, and Eric Pattillo’s motion
to tax pro per Plaintiff Wesley Robbins’ memorandum of costs is denied.
Defendants Edwin Kawasaki’s,
Stephen Radell’s, William Miller’s, William Janson’s, Caj Brejtfus’, and Lois
Evans’ joinder to Defendants Stephen
Pattillo’s, individually and dba Quality Stamp Shows and OrcoExpo, Brianna
Pattillo’s, and Eric Pattillo’s motion
is denied.
 
Defendants Stephen Pattillo,
individually and dba Quality Stamp Shows and OrcoExpo (“Stephen”), Brianna
Pattillo (“Brianna”), and Eric Pattillo (“Eric”) (collectively, “Pattillo
Defendants”) move to tax costs requested by pro per Plaintiff Wesley
Robbins (“Robbins”) (“Plaintiff”) in their entirety on the basis Plaintiff was
not the prevailing party in this case, and thus is not entitled to claim costs,
and therefore, the entirety of Plaintiff’s Memorandum of Costs must be
stricken.  (Notice Motion, pg. 2.)
Defendants Edwin Kawasaki
(“Kawasaki”), Steven Radell (“Radell”), William Miller (“Miller”), William
Janson (“Janson”), Caj Brejtfus (“Brejtfus”), and Lois Evans (“Evans”)
(“Joining Defendants”) join the Pattillo Defendants’ motion to tax and strike
the entirety of the Memorandum of Costs filed by Plaintiff.  (Notice Joining Motion, pg. 2.)
 
Procedural
Background
On
July 19, 2024, at trial, all Defendants moved for nonsuit after parties rested
upon the close of evidence before a jury. 
(8/14/24 Minute Order.)  Upon
Defendants’ motion, Plaintiff agreed to dismiss all the remaining causes of
action against Defendants.
On
July 29, 2024, Cobb filed a dismissal of his Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff
without prejudice.  The dismissal was
entered on July 30, 2024.
On
August 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Memorandum of Costs claiming $29,880.00 in
costs, consisting of $3,830.00 in filing and motion fees; $150.00 in jury fees;
$300.00 in deposition costs; $14,600.00 in service of process; $5,000.00 in attorney
fees; $3,500.00 for models, enlargements, and photocopies of exhibits; and $2,500.00
in “Other” unspecified costs.  (See
Memorandum of Costs.)  Plaintiff’s
memorandum of costs does not indicate under which pleading and which Defendants
he seeks to recover such costs.  However,
the docket reflects, under the register of actions, that on August 19, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the memorandum of costs against David Cobb (Cross-Complainant), Carl
Shaff, II (Defendant), and Steve Radell (Defendant).  The docket also reflects on the register of
actions that on August 19, 2024, Plaintiff changed the parties the memorandum
is filed against from Stephen Pattillo (Defendant), Lionel Pereira (Defendant),
Steve Radell (Defendant), John Weigle (Defendant), Carl Shaff, II (Defendant),
David Cobb (Cross-Complainant), Briana Pattillo (Defendant), Eric Pattillo
(Defendant) to David Cobb (Cross-Complainant). 
Therefore, the memorandum is only filed against David Cobb (“Cobb”) as a
Cross-Complainant.
On
August 19, 2024, Plaintiff also filed a proposed judgment against David Cobb as
Cross-Complainant.
On
August 20, 2024, Cobb filed an objection to Cross-Complainant Robbins’ Proposed
Judgment on August 19, 2024.
On
August 20, 2024, this Court denied Robbins’ proposed judgment against
Cross-Complainant Cobb.
On
August 27, 2024, Pattillo Defendants filed the instant motion.  On September 4, 2024, Joining Defendants
filed their joinder.  On November 12, 2024,
Plaintiff filed his opposition.  As of
the date of this hearing no reply has been filed.
 
Motion
to Tax Costs 
“If
the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is
on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or
necessary. On the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are
put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as
costs.”  (Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131.) 
“[T]he
mere filing of a motion to tax costs may be a ‘proper objection’ to an item,
the necessity of which appears doubtful, or which does not appear to be proper
on its face.  [Citation] However, ‘[i]f
the items appear to be proper charges the verified memorandum is prima facie
evidence that the costs, expenses and services therein listed were necessarily
incurred by the defendant [citations], and the burden of showing that an item
is not properly chargeable or is unreasonable is upon the [objecting party].’
[Citations.]”  (Id.)
“The
court’s first determination, therefore, is whether the statute expressly allows
the particular item, and whether it appears proper on its face. [Citation] If
so, the burden is on the objecting party to show them to be unnecessary or
unreasonable. [Citation.]”  (Id.) 
A prevailing party is
entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding,
except as otherwise expressly provided by statute.  (C.C.P. 
§1032(b).)  California law
recognizes three types of litigation costs: allowable, not
allowable, and discretionary.  (C.C.P.
§§1033.5(a), (b), (c)(4).) 
Items not specifically allowable as costs under C.C.P. §1033.5(a), and
not specifically prohibited under §1033.5(b), may be allowed as costs at the
discretion of the trial court if reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation.  (Citizens for Responsible
Development v. City of West Hollywood (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 490, 506,
citing Ladas v. California State Auto Association (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th
761, 774.)   For allowable costs, C.C.P.
§1033.5(c) provides: 
(2) Allowable costs
shall be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than
merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation.


(3) Allowable costs
shall be reasonable in amount.
 
(C.C.P.
§§1033.5(c)(2)-(3).)  
To the extent Plaintiff challenges
costs, they must be challenged as costs that were not, “reasonably necessary to
the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to
its preparation” or not “reasonable in amount.” 
(C.C.P. §§1033.5(c)(2)-(3).)  
A defendant who is dismissed
from the action is the “prevailing party.” (C.C.P. §1032(a)(4); see City
of Long Beach v. Stevedoring Services of America (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th
672, 678, 680 [stating cross-defendant is prevailing party entitled to costs
under §1032 when cross-complaint is dismissed as moot].)  
A defendant dismissed from
the action is the “prevailing party” regardless of whether the dismissal is
voluntary or involuntary.  (Santisas
v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606 [stating defendant entitled to costs
as a matter of right after plaintiff voluntarily dismissed proceeding]; Crib
Retaining Walls, Inc. v. NBS/Lowry, Inc. (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 886, 890 [involuntary
dismissal pursuant to C.C.P. §877.6 order approving good faith settlement]; Cano
v. Glover (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 326, 328, 331 [defendant who obtained
dismissal without prejudice and was unnamed in fourth amended complaint was
entitled to dismissal with prejudice and costs award (costs award was not
dependent on whether dismissal was with or without prejudice)].)
Where neither plaintiff nor
defendant obtains any relief, defendant is the “prevailing party.” (C.C.P.
§1032(a)(4).)
Here, the Pattillo Defendants
and Joining Defendants are not parties to Cobb’s Cross-Complaint and therefore
do not have standing to challenge Robbins’ memorandum of costs on Cobb’s
Cross-Complaint; only Cobb could challenge the costs asserted by Robbins on the
Cobb Cross-Complaint.  Therefore, Pattillo
Defendants’ and Joining Defendants’ motions to tax costs on Robbins’ memorandum
of costs on Cobb’s Cross-Complaint is denied.
In order
for the prevailing party to obtain its costs, all that is required is the
timely filing and service of the “memorandum of costs” that is verified with a
statement, “that to the best of his or her knowledge the items of costs are
correct and were necessarily incurred in the case.”  (CRC, Rule
3.1700(a)(1).)  Robbins timely
filed his Memorandum of Costs.
Here,
Robbins was the prevailing party on the Cobb Cross-Complaint because Cobb
dismissed Robbins.  (C.C.P. §1032(a)(4).)  Therefore, Robbins’ memorandum of costs on
the Cobb Cross-Complaint is proper.
In light of the fact that
Cobb did not file a motion to tax costs, Robbins is entitled to all costs
against Cobb in his August 19, 2024, Memorandum of Costs.
Accordingly, Pattillo
Defendants’ and Joining Defendants’ motions are denied.
 
         Conclusion
         Defendants Stephen Pattillo’s,
individually and dba Quality Stamp Shows and OrcoExpo, Brianna Pattillo’s, and
Eric Pattillo’s motion to tax pro per Plaintiff Wesley Robbins’ memorandum of
costs is denied.
Defendants
Edwin Kawasaki’s, Stephen Radell’s, William Miller’s, William Janson’s, Caj
Brejtfus’, and Lois Evans’ joinder to Defendants Stephen Pattillo’s,
individually and dba Quality Stamp Shows and OrcoExpo, Brianna Pattillo’s, and
Eric Pattillo’s motion is denied.
         Moving party to give notice.
