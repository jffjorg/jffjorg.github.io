And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Tyrone Murphy's unopposed motion for leave to amend his second amended complaint and file a third amended complaint. The motion was denied because it did not substantially comply with California Rules of Court (CRC) rules. Specifically, the motion did not include a copy of the proposed third amended complaint, and Plaintiff failed to submit a declaration setting forth the allegations proposed to be added and deleted, and when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered. The judge also noted that Plaintiff did not follow the proper format for the first page of a filing with the Court, as required by CRC Rule 2.111. The motion was denied without prejudice, meaning Plaintiff can re-file the motion if the issues are remedied.
