```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the motion to tax costs filed by Pattillo Defendants and Joining Defendants, which sought to strike the entirety of Plaintiff Wesley Robbins' Memorandum of Costs. The judge finds that Plaintiff was the prevailing party on the Cross-Complaint filed by David Cobb, as Cobb dismissed the Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff. As a result, Plaintiff is entitled to all costs against Cobb in his Memorandum of Costs, which totals $29,880.00. The judge also finds that Pattillo Defendants and Joining Defendants lack standing to challenge Plaintiff's costs on the Cross-Complaint, as they are not parties to the Cross-Complaint.
