 Case
  No.:  23STCV31463
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  November 26, 2024



 
The Court denies Plaintiff’s default
judgment packet.  
The Court sets a hearing on an order
to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or Plaintiff’s
counsel sanctioned $250 for failing to enter default judgment (California Rule
of Court, rule 3.110(h)) on December 27, 2024, at 8:30 AM in Department 71 at
Stanley Mosk Courthouse for the following reasons:

1.     No
interest calculation provided.  The
proposed judgment indicates that interest is sought at a rate of 15%.  Breach of contract claims have a default
prejudgment interest rate of 10% (unless a different rate is specified in the
contract).  (See Civ. Code §3289(b); Cal. Const., art. XV, §1.)  Plaintiff fails to demonstrate why the
interest rate is 15% for a breach of contract claim, and where the contract
provides for a 15% interest rate.
 
The supplemental declaration of Bo
Seong Jang fails to provide the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate (“WSJP”) that is
the basis for the interest calculation of 15%.
