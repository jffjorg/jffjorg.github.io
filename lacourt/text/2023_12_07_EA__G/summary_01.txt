And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Ford Motor Company's motion for a protective order to govern the production of confidential materials in this lemon law action. The court has modified the proposed protective order to address certain concerns raised by the parties. The modifications include striking language that would limit access to Ford's documents to only attorneys in the same firm, and adding language that would require counsel to deliver a copy of the protective order to mock jury participants prior to disclosing confidential materials. The court has also declined to issue a protective order with certain proposed modifications, including language that would prohibit the posting or sale of confidential documents and language that would require the return or destruction of confidential documents after settlement or termination of the case. The court's decision is based on its discretion to grant and craft protective orders under California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.090, 2031.060, and 2033.080.
