And here is the English text summary:

The City of Diamond Bar has filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin John Zhong and Catherine Li from continuing to operate a short-term rental at the Knoll Court property in violation of the Diamond Bar Municipal Code. The City alleges that Zhong and Li have been operating the property as a short-term rental since March 2022, despite multiple notices of violation and citations issued by the City. The City seeks to enjoin Zhong and Li from continuing to operate the property as a short-term rental, arguing that it is likely to prevail on the merits of the case and that the potential harm to the City outweighs any potential harm to Zhong and Li. The Court finds that the City has established a reasonable probability of success on the merits and that the potential harm to the City outweighs any potential harm to Zhong and Li. Therefore, the Court grants the City's motion and enjoins Zhong and Li from continuing to operate the property as a short-term rental.
