And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge has temporarily ruled on a motion by the State of California to dismiss the complaint filed by Sonia Moreno. The judge has decided to continue the hearing to a later date to allow the parties to meet and confer (talk and discuss) about the issues in the case. The judge has also ordered the State's lawyer to file a document describing the results of these discussions at least 9 days before the next hearing. This is because the State's lawyer did not properly show that they met and conferred with Moreno's lawyer before filing the motion to dismiss.
