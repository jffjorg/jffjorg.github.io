And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of John Roe L.S. v. California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The case involves allegations of sexual abuse by CDCR employees and inmates, and claims for damages, negligence, and civil rights violations. The judge has sustained CDCR's demurrer to the second through seventh causes of action in the operative complaint, which means that those claims are dismissed. The judge has also denied CDCR's motion to strike out portions of the operative complaint as moot. The judge has granted Plaintiff 20 days' leave to amend the operative complaint. The ruling is based on the court's interpretation of California Code of Civil Procedure section 340.16(a)(1), which revives certain expired claims, including claims alleging a cover-up of previous instances of sexual assault. The judge has determined that CDCR is a "legal entity" within the meaning of the statute and that the Legislature intended to revive certain expired claims.
