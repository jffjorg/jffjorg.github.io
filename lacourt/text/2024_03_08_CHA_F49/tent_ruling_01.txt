  Case Number:  22CHCV00821    Hearing Date:   March 8, 2024    Dept:  F49    Dept.    F49      Date:    3/8/24     Case    Name: Surjit Multani, et al. v. Sanjiv Jain, et al.     Case    # 22CHCV00821      LOS  ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH  VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT  F49    MARCH 8, 2024    MOTION TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT  (C.C.P. ¶ 473(b))  Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 22CHCV00821    Motion  filed: 12/5/23   MOVING PARTY: Defendants Sanjiv Jain and Shubha Jain RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiffs Surjit Multani and  Amrita Multani (collectively, “Plaintiffs”)  NOTICE: ok    RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order setting aside the Default and Default Judgment if entered.   TENTATIVE  RULING: The  motion is GRANTED.   BACKGROUND   On October 5, 2022, Plaintiffs initiated the present action  against Defendants Sanjiv Jain, Shubha Jain (collectively, “Defendants”), and  all persons unknown, claiming any legal or equitable right, title, estate,  lien, or interest in the property described in the Complaint adverse to Plaintiff’s  title, or any could on Plaintiffs’ title thereto, and Does 1 through 50.     On August 21, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their operative First  Amended Complaint (“FAC”), alleging the following causes of action: (1) Breach  of Contract; (2) Fraud; (3) Preliminary and Permanent Injunction; and (4)  Declaratory Relief.   On October 17, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Request for Entry of  Default, which was entered on the same day. However, no Judgment of Default is  shown in the case files.   On December 5, 2023, Defendants filed the instant Motion to  Set Aside Default (the “Motion”).    On February 28, 2024, Plaintiffs opposed the Motion.  Subsequently, on March 1, 2024, Defendants replied.     ANALYSIS   Under Code of  Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision (b), an application for relief must  be made no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is  sought and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the moving  party’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,  subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130,  143.)                Here, the  Default against Defendants was entered on October 17, 2023, and the instant  Motion was filed on December 5, 2023, which falls within the six-month time  limit under Code of Civil Procedure section 473 subdivision (b).   Moreover, the Motion is accompanied by Defendants’  counsel’s declaration, stating that the entry of default took them by surprise  as negotiations were ongoing with Plaintiffs regarding setting a mediation  (Mot., 4, Joshi Decl., ¶¶ 7-8), and Plaintiffs counsel did not provide notice  of taking Default. (Joshi Decl., ¶ 9.)   The Court notes that it is a settled rule that by taking a  default without giving notice, counsel took the risk that the trial court would  grant relief from the default (Pearson v. Continental Airlines (1970) 11 Cal.App.3d 613, 619), however, the failure to notify did  not require the court to grant relief. (Bellm v. Bellia (1984)  150 Cal.App.3d 1036, 1038.)   Nevertheless, the Court finds that Defendants’ neglect in  failing to provide an Answer due to the ongoing negotiation with Plaintiffs regarding  setting a mediation is excusable.    Furthermore, Plaintiffs acknowledge that they have no  objection to setting aside the Default, although they argue that “the order  should be conditioned on Defendants’ filing an Answer to FAC within 20 days.”  (Opp’n., at 2, ¶ 8.)   Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the Motion to Set Aside  Default entered on October 17, 2023, against Defendants. Additionally, the  Court exercises its discretion under Code of Civil Procedure section 437  subdivision (a), allowing Defendants to file their answer or other appropriate  pleadings within 10 days of the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1)  [“The court may, ... upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or demurrer.”])   CONCLUSION   Defendants’ Motion to Set Aside Default is GRANTED.    Defendants are ordered to file an Answer or other  appropriate pleadings within 10 days.    Moving party is ordered to provide notice of this order.
