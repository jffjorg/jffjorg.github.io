Summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to quash service of summons filed by Mr. Jose G. Arriaga (Mr. Arriaga Senior) in the case of Jane Doe v. Jose Arriaga, et al. (Case #23CHCV02609). Mr. Arriaga Senior contends that he was not properly served with process and is not the intended defendant. The plaintiff, Jane Doe, opposes the motion, arguing that service on Mr. Arriaga Junior was successfully completed on November 3, 2023, subsequent to the filing of the instant motion. The court agrees with the plaintiff that Mr. Arriaga Senior is not the intended defendant and that service on Mr. Arriaga Junior was successful. Therefore, the court denies the motion to quash as moot.
