 Case Number:  23CHCV02609    Hearing Date:   March 8, 2024    Dept:  F49 Dept. F49  Date: 3/8/24 Case  Name: Jane Doe v.  Jose  Arriaga, et al. Case #23CHCV02609   LOS  ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH  VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT  F49    MARCH 8, 2024    MOTION TO QUASH SERVICE OF  SUMMONS  Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 23CHCV02609    Motion  filed: 10/3/23   MOVING PARTY: Special appearing Mr. Jose G. Arriaga  (“Mr. Arriaga Senior”) RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Jane Doe (“Plaintiff”)  NOTICE: ok    RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order to quash the service of summons on Mr. Arriaga Senior   TENTATIVE  RULING: The  motion is DENIED AS MOOT.   BACKGROUND   On August 30, 2023, Plaintiff initiated this action against  Defendants Magic Mountain, LLC, Jose Arriaga (“Mr. Arriaga Junior”), and Does 1  through 50. The Complaint alleges 12 causes of action: (1) sexual battery/abuse  of a minor; (2) intentional infliction of emotional distress; and (3) sexual  harassment; (4) negligent hiring, supervision & retention of an unfit  employee; (5) negligent failure to warn, train or educate; (6) negligent  supervision of a minor; (7) negligence; (8) retaliation in violation of the  FEHA; (9) retaliation under Labor Code §§ 98.6, 1102.5; (10) sexual harassment  in violation of FEHA; (11) discrimination in violation of FEHA; and (12)  failure to prevent harassment and discrimination in violation of FEHA.   On October 3, 2023, special appearing Mr. Arriaga Senior filed  the instant Motion to Quash Service of Summons on him, asserting that he is not  the intended Defendant Mr. Arriaga Junior. (Arriaga Decl., ¶ 3.)   On February 26, 2024, Plaintiff opposed the Motion.  Subsequently, Mr. Arriaga Senior replied on February 29, 2024.   ANALYSIS   “A defendant, on or before the last day or his or  her time to plead or within any further time that the court may for good cause  allow, may serve and file a notice of motion. . . (1) To quash service of  summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her. .  .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10.) (Underlines added.)   “A motion to quash service of summons lies on the ground  that the court lacks personal, not subject matter, jurisdiction over the moving  party.” (Greener v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals Bd. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1028,  1036.)                 “When  a defendant challenges the court’s personal jurisdiction on the ground of  improper service of process ‘the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the  existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an  effective service.’” (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403,  413.)    Under certain circumstances, service is authorized by leaving a copy of the summons and  complaint at the person’s dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of  business, or usual mailing address in the presence of a competent member of the  household; and thereafter mailing additional  copies to defendant. (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20, subd. (b).) However, in using substitute service for individual, as  opposed to entity, defendants, a plaintiff must show a good faith effort at  personal service (“reasonable diligence” requirement) must first be attempted.  (Ibid.) “Ordinarily. . . two or three attempts at personal service at a  proper place should fully satisfy the requirement of reasonable diligence and  allow substituted service to be made." (Bein v. Brechtel-Jochim Group,  Inc. (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1387, 1391-1392, internal quotations and citation  omitted.)    A.     Limited  Scope Representation in Special Appearing   On October 3, 2023, counsel Mr. David Russomanno  (“Counsel”) filed a Notice of Limited Scope Representation (Form “CIV-150”), indicating  that his representation is limited to special appearing for “Jose G. Arriaga,”  and “only on matters and appearances related to the Special Appearing Jose  Arriaga’s Motion to Quash.” (CIV-150, ¶¶ 1, 2c.)   The Court acknowledges that Counsel’s representation is  solely for Mr. Arriaga Senior based on the filed CIV-150 form. Importantly, Counsel  is not authorized to present legal arguments on behalf of Mr. Arriaga Junior,  who is not the moving party and is not represented by Counsel at the time of  the filing.   Consequently, the Court deems any arguments made on behalf  of Defendant Mr. Arriga Junior to be procedurally improper and irrelevant.   B.      Motion to Quash   Mr. Arriaga  Senior contends that Plaintiff failed to properly serve him personally or  through substitute service when the process server left case documents on his  property at 27758 Walnut Spring Ave., Canyon Country, CA, 91351 (“Canyon  Country address”) on September 3, 2023. (Arriaga Decl., ¶ 3.) He argues that he  is the “wrong Jose Arriaga” as he had never worked at Magic Mountain. (Mot. at  1.) Moreover, in his Reply, Mr. Arriaga Senior states that he informed the  process server that the intended Defendant, Mr. Arriaga Junior, no longer lived  at this address and had moved out of state. (Reply, at 3.) In response, Plaintiff acknowledges that Defendant  Mr. Arriaga Junior’s full name is Jose Antonio Arriaga, noting that he shares  the same first and last name as his father, Mr. Arriaga Senior. (Opp’n., at 1.)  Nonetheless, Plaintiff argues that Mr. Arriaga Senior’s Motion is moot because Mr.  Arriaga Senior was not the defendant, and service on Defendant Mr. Arriaga  Junior was successfully completed on November 3, 2023, subsequent to the filing  of the instant Motion. The Court agrees with the Plaintiff that, even if the  service on September 3, 2023, is unsuccessful, it is undisputed that Mr.  Arriaga Senior is not the intended defendant; rather, the service of process  was aimed at his son, Defendant Mr. Arriaga Junior. Furthermore, as outlined  above, any arguments related to the subsequent services of process, which occurred  on October 3 and October 31, 2023, must be brought forward by the proper party,  Defendant Arriaga Junior. It is clear in the Motion that Mr. Arriaga Senior  moves under the authority of Code of Civil Procedure section 418.10 which  provides, in relevant part, “[a] defendant, ... may serve and file a  notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes: (1) To quash  service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him  or her.” (Underlines added.) Considering Mr. Arriaga Senior is not a defendant  in the present case, section 418.10 is inapplicable.  Accordingly, the Court DENIES AS MOOT the Motion to  Quash.   CONCLUSION   Special  appearing Mr. Jose G. Arriaga’s Motion to  Quash Service of Summons is DENIED AS MOOT.   Moving  party to give notice of this order.
