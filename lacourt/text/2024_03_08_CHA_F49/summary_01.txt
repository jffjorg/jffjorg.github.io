And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants, granting their motion to set aside the default judgment entered on October 17, 2023. The default was entered despite ongoing negotiations between the parties regarding a potential mediation. The judge found that the defendants' neglect in failing to provide an answer due to these negotiations was excusable and that the failure to provide notice of taking default did not require the court to deny relief. The judge has also ordered the defendants to file an answer or other appropriate pleadings within 10 days.
