Summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Motion for Leave to File Cross-Complaint filed by the moving Defendants, Valdez Innovations Inc., Ricardo Valdez, and Oscar Valdez. The Court finds that the proposed cross-complaint is compulsory and that the moving Defendants acted in good faith in seeking leave to file it. The Court concludes that the moving Defendants' failure to file the cross-complaint earlier was due to a good faith mistake and inadvertent delay, and that they did not act in bad faith. The Court orders the moving Defendants to file their Cross-Complaint within 15 days of the hearing and to submit proof of service within the same period.
