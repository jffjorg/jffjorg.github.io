Inc., et al.
Case No.: 19NWCV00633

#1
Tentative Ruling 
On its own motion, the Court appoints a
Discovery Referee for all discovery purposes in this action.  Until further order of the Court, all costs
shall be borne by Defendant S&H Business Management, Inc.
Clerk to give notice.  
Background
This is a shareholder derivative action filed on August 8,
2019. On May 16, 2022, Plaintiff Myung Sik Kim (“Plaintiff”) filed a second
amended complaint against Defendant S&H Business Management, Inc.
(“Defendant”) alleging: (1) Involuntary Dissolution of a Corporation; (2)
Accounting; (3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (4) Aiding and Abetting Breach of
Fiduciary Duty; (5) Breach of Fiduciary Duty- Duty of Care, Loyalty, and Good
Faith; (6) Constructive Trust; and (7) Declaratory Relief
On February 13, 2024, the Court on its own motion, and
without opposition, appointed a discovery referee for all discovery purposes in
the action. (CCP 639(a)(5).) The Court found that Plaintiff was unable to pay a
pro rata share of the referee’s fee based upon her declaration.  The Court ordered that all costs be paid by
Defendant S&H Business Management, Inc. (“S&H”). On February 22, 2024,
pursuant to the Court’s order, Plaintiff Myung Sik Kim (“Plaintiff”) filed a
list of nominees for appointment. On February 27, 2024, Defendants filed an
objection to the Court’s February 13, 2024 order to the extent that it required
S&H to bear all costs. Defendants argued that Plaintiff’s declaration was
insufficient to establish an inability to pay because it merely stated that
dividend payments from S&H “were my means to support myself” (Kim Decl., ¶
23) and not her “sole income” as Plaintiff argued in her brief. (See
Plaintiff’s Response to OSC re Appointment of Discovery Referee, p. 2:6-7.)
Defendants also pointed out that Plaintiff admits to financing this litigation
and another related litigation without dividend payments from S&H. (Kim
Decl., ¶ 24.) On February 29, 2024, the Court, on its own motion, scheduled a
hearing for today’s date to reconsider the issue of Plaintiff’s inability to
pay and the apportionment of costs.  Plaintiff
was permitted to file supplemental evidence relating to her inability to pay.  
Revised
Finding re Ability to Pay to Costs
On March 11, 2024, Plaintiff submitted a supplemental declaration
regarding her income. In her declaration, Plaintiff declared that in 2019 she
received $14,250.00 from S&H.  She
and her husband received $16,173.00 from the Social Security Administration.
(Kim Decl., ¶¶4-6.) Since 2019, Plaintiff has not received any income from
S&H.  She and her husband continue to
receive Social Security benefits in the following amounts: $16,687.00 (2020)
$16,932.00 (2021) $17,930.00 (2022) and $19,483.20 (2023). (Kim Decl., ¶¶7-17.)

A court shall not appoint a referee at a cost to the
parties if one party is unable to pay and no other party is willing to pay that
additional share of the referee’s fee. 
The Code provides as follows: “All appointments of referees pursuant to
this section shall be by written order and shall include the following … (6)(A)
Either a finding that no party has established an economic inability to pay a
pro rata share of the referee’s fee or a finding that one or more parties has
established an economic inability to pay a pro rata share of the referee’s fees
and that another party has agreed voluntarily to pay that additional share of
the referee’s fee. A court shall not appoint a referee at a cost to the parties
if neither of these findings is made.” (CCP §639(d)(6)(A).)  
The Court’s February 13, 2024 order appointing a discovery
referee was issued without objection.  In
light of Defendant’s objections filed on February 27, 2024, the Court will
reconsider its February 13, 2024 order.  
The Court determines that Plaintiff’s supplemental
declaration is insufficient to establish her inability to pay.  Plaintiff fails to account for any other
assets she may own (e.g., cash, savings, real property, etc.), any interest she
may have in community property, and her monthly expenses.  Therefore, the Court cannot determine that
Plaintiff is unable to pay a pro rata share of the referee’s fee.  Pursuant to CCP §639(d)(6)(A), the Court
determines that no party has established an economic inability to pay a pro
rata share of the referee’s fee.  
Exceptional
Circumstances for Appointment of Discovery Referee
The Court continues to find that exceptional circumstances
exist for the appointment of a Discovery Referee pursuant to Code Civ. Pro. §
639, subd. (a)(5) and Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.920(c).  Among other discovery requests, Plaintiff has
propounded 323 Special Interrogatories upon Defendant S&H.  Plaintiff argues that as a 50% owner of
S&H, she has a right to review S&H’s records, but Defendants are
denying her all access to them. Defendants argue that Plaintiff is abusing the
discovery process by propounding a “massive” amount of discovery. Defendants
contend Plaintiff has twice been given access to tens of thousands of documents
under the authority of Corporations Code Section 1600. Plaintiff seeks
$17,600.00 in monetary sanctions against Defendants and Defendants seek
$4,200.00 in monetary sanctions against Plaintiff for misuse of the discovery
process. Six motions to compel further responses are scheduled for April 30,
2024, three additional motions to compel further responses are reserved for
July 16, 2024, a Motion to Compel In Person Deposition of Person Most Qualified
is reserved for August 15, 2024, and three additional Motions to Compel Further
Discovery Responses are reserved for September 5, 2024. The court has already
addressed two prior motions for further responses and a motion to vacate the
order to compel further responses. Prior meet and confer efforts have failed.
Scope
of Reference and Authority of Discovery Referee
Accordingly, a Discovery Referee is appointed for all
discovery purposes in the action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 639, subd. (c); Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.922(c)(2).) The referee is authorized to set the date,
time, and place for all hearings determined by the referee to be necessary;
direct the issuance of subpoenas; preside over hearings; take evidence; and
rule on objections, motions, and other requests made during the course of the
hearing. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.922(e).) No court facilities or court
personnel may be used in connection with the reference. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.922(g).) 
Referee
Information and Hourly Rate
Having considered Plaintiff’s proposed list of referees
filed on February 22, 2024, and without objection by Defendant, the Court
appoints Michael S. Fields, State Bar# 43347, 6171 Laguna Court, Long Beach, CA
90803, (562) 597-5399 at a maximum hourly rate of $500.00.  
Apportionment
of costs
“When a referee is appointed pursuant to Section 639, at
any time after a determination of ability to pay is made as specified in
paragraph (6) of subdivision (d) of Section 639, the court may order the
parties to pay the fees of referees … in any manner determined by the court to
be fair and reasonable, including an apportionment of the fees among the
parties. For purposes of this section, the term “parties” does not include
parties’ counsel.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 645.1.) 
The Court continues to believe that requiring Defendant
S&H to bear all costs is fair and reasonable because Plaintiff Kim and
Defendant Chang are equal owners of S&H.  Accordingly, Defendant S&H is ordered to
bear all costs associated with the Discovery Referee.  This order is without prejudice to any party
seeking a modification of the apportionment of costs.  In that event, the Court will consider the
recommendation of the referee as a factor in determining any modification.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.922(f)(3).
