Summary:

The Court appoints a Discovery Referee to manage discovery in this shareholder derivative action. The Court determines that Plaintiff Myung Sik Kim is not unable to pay costs, as she has not established her inability to pay a pro rata share of the referee's fee. The Court orders Defendant S&H Business Management, Inc. to bear all costs associated with the Discovery Referee, as Plaintiff and Defendant are equal owners of S&H. The Court sets the scope of reference and authority of the Discovery Referee and appoints Michael S. Fields as the referee at a maximum hourly rate of $500.00.
