Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling written by a Judge regarding a future Court Hearing in the case of Carlos Barraza, et al. vs Norwalk Community Hospital, et al. (Case No. 23NWCV01686). The case concerns a wrongful death action arising from the death of Sofia Barraza on June 11, 2022. The Plaintiffs, Carlos Barraza and Martha Cowan, are the children of Sofia Barraza and are seeking damages from the defendants, including Norwalk Community Hospital, Los Angeles Community Hospital, and several individual medical professionals.

The Judge has ruled on two motions: a demurrer by the Chadha Defendants, who contend that the Third Cause of Action for Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and a motion to strike by the Chadha Defendants, who seek to strike certain paragraphs of the Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint.

The Judge has overruled the demurrer as to Plaintiff Carlos Barraza, finding that he has sufficiently alleged a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress. However, the Judge has sustained the demurrer as to Plaintiff Martha Cowan, finding that she has not sufficiently pleaded a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress.

The Judge has granted the motion to strike as to Plaintiff Martha Cowan, finding that her allegations do not support a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress. The Judge has denied the motion to strike as to Plaintiff Carlos Barraza, finding that his allegations do support a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress.

The Judge has given Plaintiffs 30 days to amend their complaint to address the defects identified in the demurrer and motion to strike.
