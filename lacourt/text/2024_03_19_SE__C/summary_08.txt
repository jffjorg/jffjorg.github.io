Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion for leave to file a cross-complaint filed by the defendants, Mike Thompson, Recreational Vehicles, Santa Fe Springs, Grand Design RV, LLC, and Bank of the West. The defendants propose to file a cross-complaint against Cummins, Inc., the manufacturer of the generator, alleging equitable indemnity and contribution claims. The judge finds that the cross-complaint is compulsory, as it arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the causes of action in the plaintiff's complaint. The judge also finds that the defendants' delay in filing the motion is not evidence of bad faith. As the motion is unopposed, the judge grants the motion, allowing the defendants to file their cross-complaint.
