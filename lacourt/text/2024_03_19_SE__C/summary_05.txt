And here is the English-language summary:

The Judge, Lorraine L. Cota, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to set aside a default judgment against Defendant Michelle Toscano. The motion was filed because Defendant Toscano claims that the summons and complaint were not served on her, and therefore the default judgment is void. However, the court found that the proof of service, which was signed by a process server, showed that the documents were personally served on Defendant Toscano at her home address. The court also noted that Defendant Toscano's son, who was present at the time of service, was over 18 years old and could have accepted the documents. Therefore, the court denied the motion to set aside the default judgment.
