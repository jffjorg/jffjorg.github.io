And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Henry Aguila, brought a lawsuit against the defendants, alleging breach of contract, negligence, interference with prospective advantage, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. However, the defendants argued that Aguila lacks standing to bring the lawsuit because he was not a party to the 2006 reciprocal easement agreement (REA) that the defendants allegedly violated.

The judge ruled that the defendants have made a prima facie showing that Aguila has no standing to bring the lawsuit. Aguila argued that he acquired a leasehold interest in the property by entering into a 50-year lease with Thee Aguila, Inc. (TAI) in 2020, but the judge found that TAI had defaulted on its loan and the lender had foreclosed on the property in 2017, three years before the lease was allegedly entered into. The judge also found that the sale of the property to the defendants was valid and not in violation of a Bankruptcy Court stay.

The judge concluded that Aguila lacks standing to make a valid claim against the defendants and granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment.
