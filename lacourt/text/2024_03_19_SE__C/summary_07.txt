And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on International Forklift Company's motion to compel further responses from Irvin Aguilar, the plaintiff. The motion is continued to April 2, 2024, to allow the company to file a separate statement and for the motion to be heard on its merits. The company had previously propounded special interrogatories on the plaintiff, who had served verified responses. However, the company failed to include a separate statement with its motion, as required by law. The judge finds that the company has fulfilled the meet and confer requirement, and allows the motion to proceed with the filing of the separate statement.
