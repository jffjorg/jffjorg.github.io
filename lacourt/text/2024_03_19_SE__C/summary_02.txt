And here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Loma Linda University Shared Services' motion to transfer the venue of the case from Los Angeles County to San Bernardino County. The judge finds that the motion is timely and that at the commencement of the action, no defendant lived in Los Angeles County. The judge determines that venue is proper in San Bernardino County because Loma Linda University Shared Services is a resident of that county. The judge also finds that the motion is mandatory under California Code of Civil Procedure section 396b(a) and that the court cannot exercise discretion to retain the case in Los Angeles County for the convenience of witnesses.
