Defendant to give notice. 
 
Defendant Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club,
Inc. (“Defendant”) moves to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Xiomara Varela
Mendoza (“Plaintiff”) pursuant to CCP § 2025.450.  
As of March 15, 2024, no opposition has been filed. 
Background 
Plaintiff’s vehicle was stolen in October 2020.  Plaintiff sues the insurer for (1) Breach of
Insurance Contract, (2) Bad Faith Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and
Fair Dealing and (3) Declaratory Relief. 

Legal Standards 
CCP¿section¿2025.450(a) provides:¿“If, after service of a
deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing
agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that
is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection
under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it,
or to produce for¿inspection any document . . . described in the deposition
notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order¿compelling the
deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any
document . . . described in the deposition notice.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450(a).)¿ 
Discussion 
Plaintiff’s deposition had previously been noticed and set
for November 13, 2023 and November 17, 2023 after meet and confer attempts with
Plaintiff’s counsel. (Bridwell Decl., ¶ 4, Exhibits A-D.) The Second Amended
Notice of Taking Deposition of Plaintiff Upon Oral Examination set the
deposition for December 1, 2023 at 10:00 a.m. (Bridwell Decl., ¶ 4, Exhibits
C.) Plaintiff failed to appear and Defendant received a Certificate of
Non-Appearance. (Bridwell Decl., ¶ 4, Exhibits D.)
Defendant now seeks an order to compel Plaintiff to appear
at deposition within fifteen days of the order. 
Given that Plaintiff has not attended any of the prior
properly noticed depositions, the Court finds good cause to grant the motion to
compel.  
Accordingly, the Court compels deposition of Plaintiff
within 30 days of this order. 
Sanctions 
“If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under… in favor of the party who noticed the
deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (CCP § 2025.450(g)(1).) 
Here, Plaintiff has not opposed the motion. Therefore, the
Court does not find there is a substantial justification for not appearing at
the deposition. 
Defendant requests $1,500.00 in sanctions (three hours
preparing the motion, two hours analyzing and responding to a potential
Opposition, three hours preparing for and appearing for the hearing on the
Motion to Compel at a rate of $180 an hour, and a $60.00 for reimbursement of
filing fees.) 
Taking into consideration the lack of opposition, the Court
awards sanctions in the reduced amount of $690.00 (three hours preparing the
motion and a half hour appearing at the hearing at $180.00 per hour, as well as
a reimbursement of the $60.00 filing fee).
