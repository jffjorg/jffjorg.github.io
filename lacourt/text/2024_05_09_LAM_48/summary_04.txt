"Based on the information presented, the court grants the defendant's motion for leave to file an amended answer. The defendant seeks to add an affirmative defense under Education Code section 44808, which provides immunity for off-campus conduct. The defendant first learned of this defense on November 2, 2023, when conducting the plaintiff's deposition. The court finds that the amendment is necessary and proper to ensure the defendant's due process right to allege and try an affirmative defense. The defendant is ordered to file and serve the amended answer within 5 days."
