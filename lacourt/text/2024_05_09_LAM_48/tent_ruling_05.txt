[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING
  IN PART MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT/ADJUDICATION 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
May 9, 2024



 
On June 21, Plaintiff William S. Jameson, Jr. filed this
action against Defendants Lucia Lopez and Yoel Lopez.
On
February 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative,
summary adjudication.  Defendants did not
file any oppositions.
REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
Plaintiff’s
request for judicial notice of Debtor’s Motion for Voluntary Dismissal of Chapter
13 Case filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of
California – Riverside Division, In Re Yoel Lopez and Lucia Yaneisis Ruizaday,
Debtors, Case No. 6:23-bk-15781-WJ is denied as irrelevant.
LEGAL
STANDARD
A
plaintiff moving for summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof
by proving each element of a cause of action. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) 
That includes damages when damages are an element.  (Paramount Petroleum Corp. v. Superior Court
(2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 226, 241.)  Then the
burden shifts to the defendant to show that a triable issue of material fact exists
as to the cause of action or a defense.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)  To establish
a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce “substantial
responsive evidence.”  (Sangster v. Paetkau
(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 162-163.)
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff’s
motion is primarily based on Defendants’ deemed admissions (“RFAs”) from Plaintiff’s
Requests for Admissions and the Court’s October 17, 2023 order deeming the admissions
admitted by Defendants.
Where
a party fails to timely respond to a request for admission, the propounding party
may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  “[A] deemed admitted order establishes, by judicial
fiat, that a nonresponding party has responded to the requests by admitting the
truth of all matters contained therein.” 
(Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 979.)  “Any matter admitted in response to a request
for admission is conclusively established against the party making the admission
in the pending action.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.410, subd. (a).)  “As a general rule
an admission is conclusive in the action as to the party making it.  [Citations.] 
Absent leave of court to amend or withdraw the admission, no contradictory
evidence may be introduced.”  (Murillo
v. Superior Court (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 730, 736 (Murillo).)  “‘Sometimes, the admissions obtained will even
leave the party making them vulnerable to summary judgment.’  [Citations.]” 
(St. Mary v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 775.)
The
first cause of action is for breach of an unsecured promissory note, through which
Lucia Lopez promised to repay Plaintiff $400,000.00 by April 15, 2021.  The second cause of action is a common count for
money had and received under the same promissory note.  The third cause of action alleges that Defendants
fraudulently promised to repay the promissory note.  The fourth cause of action is for unjust enrichment
and restitution of the amount loaned under the promissory note.
A.        The Motion Is Granted With Respect to
Defendant Lucia Lopez.
Through
the deemed admissions, Plaintiff has established the existence and terms of the
promissory note with Lucia Lopez and Plaintiff’s performance by lending the money.  (Undisputed Material Facts “UMF” 1, 4-6, 10.)  Lucia has made only $5,000.00 in payments.  (UMF 11.)
Plaintiff
has proven that Lucia breached the promissory note.  Plaintiff has also proven his damages of $395,000.00,
interest of $82,500.71 (see Civ. Code, § 3289, subd. (b)), and sanctions of $3,420.00
(pursuant to the Court’s October 17, 2023 order), for a total judgment of $480,920.71.  (See Motion at pp. 4-5.)
Defendants
did not file a written opposition with evidence to show that a triable issue of
material fact exists, nor can they submit evidence to contradict their judicial
admissions.  (Murillo, supra, 143 Cal.App.4th
at p. 736.)
Accordingly,
summary judgment is granted in favor of Plaintiff and against Lucia Lopez.
B.        The Motion Is Denied With Respect to Defendant
Yoel Lopez.
Despite
the parties’ deemed admissions, some of these admissions are not supported by the
other evidence.  The trial court has the power
“to determine the admissibility and relevance of evidence related to admitted facts.
. . .  The court must have discretion to admit
evidence to elucidate and explain an admission, because the admission of a fact
does not always reflect the party’s reasonable understanding of that fact.”  (Fredericks v. Filbert Co. (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d
272, 278.)
Lucia
is the only borrower under the promissory note. 
(Motion, Ex. A.)  Because Yoel was
not a party to the agreement, he cannot be liable for breach of contract (first
cause of action).  Summary adjudication of
the first cause of action is denied.
For
the same reason, Yoel cannot be liable for the common count (second cause of action).  “A cause
of action for money had and received is stated if it is alleged the defendant ‘is
indebted to the plaintiff in a certain sum “for money had and received by the defendant
for the use of the plaintiff.”’  [Citation.]”  (Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Zerin (1997)
53 Cal.App.4th 445, 460.)  Yoel was not indebted
to Plaintiff under the promissory note.  Summary
adjudication of the second cause of action is denied.
The
fraud claim (third cause of action) alleges that both Defendants “told Plaintiff
they needed to borrow $400,000 to purchase the Property.  They promised to repay the loan 3 weeks after
the money was lent.  Thereafter, they repeatedly
promised to make payments on the loan, with a series of untruthful claims as to
why they failed to pay.”  The initial promise
to repay in three weeks is superseded by the promissory note signed by only Lucia.
For
the subsequent, repeated promises to repay, Yoel admitted that “in text messages,
Lucia Lopez and Yoel Lopez repeatedly promised to repay the $400,000 lent by Plaintiff,”
and he never intended to repay the $400,000 borrowed from Plaintiff.”  (Motion, Ex. D at p. 2 [RFA Nos. 10, 12].)  A fraud cause of action may be based on a false
promise if “the promisor did not intend to perform at the time he or she made the
promise and . . . it was intended to deceive or induce the promisee to do or not
do a particular thing.”  (Tarmann v. State
Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 159.)  Here, however, Plaintiff was not induced to do
anything in reliance on Yoel’s promises. 
Plaintiff had already loaned the $400,000.00 to Lucia.  Without detrimental reliance by Plaintiff on Yoel’s
misrepresentation, there is no actionable fraud.  (See Charnay v. Cobert (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th
170, 184 [among its elements, fraud requires justifiable reliance by the plaintiff].)  Summary adjudication of the third cause of action
is denied.
For
unjust enrichment (fourth cause of action), Plaintiff must prove “the ‘receipt of
a benefit and [the] unjust retention of the benefit at the expense of another.’  [Citation.]” 
(Peterson v. Cellco Partnership (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1583, 1593.)  Unjust enrichment is not a cause of action, but
a court may construe a cause of action for unjust enrichment as a cause of action
for quasi-contract seeking restitution.  (Rutherford
Holdings, LLC v. Plaza Del Rey (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 221, 231.)  “[T]he quasi-contract, or contract ‘implied in
law,’ is an obligation created by the law without regard to the intention of the
parties and designed to restore the aggrieved party to his former position by the
return of the thing delivered or the money expended.”  (Masonite Corp. v. Pacific Gas & Electric
Co. (1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 1, 10-11.)
Plaintiff
appears to base this claim on Lucia’s purchase of real property using the $400,000.00
and her subsequent transfer of the property to Yoel.  (See UMF 43-55.)  The promissory note was intended to provide Defendants
with a loan to purchase real property.  (UMF
45-46, 48.)  Defendants did use the funds
to purchase a house.  (UMF 49.)  On February 10, 2022, Lucia executed an interspousal
transfer grant deed, granting the property to Yoel as his sole and separate property.  (UMF 54; Motion, Ex. G.)
Yoel
is not “‘indebted to the plaintiff in a
certain sum “for money had and received by the defendant for the use of the plaintiff.”’  [Citation.]” 
(Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Zerin (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 445, 460.)  Yoel benefitted from Lucia’s borrowed funds, but
he did not receive funds for the use of Plaintiff.  Summary adjudication of the fourth cause
of action is denied.
CONCLUSION
The
motion for summary judgment is GRANTED in favor of Plaintiff and against Lucia Lopez.  Plaintiff is ordered to submit a proposed judgment
within ten days.  A Non-Appearance Case Review
Re: Submission of Proposed Judgment is scheduled for May 22, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.
The
motion for summary judgment is DENIED as to Yoel Lopez.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
