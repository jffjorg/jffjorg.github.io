And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Hon. Thomas D. Long, issued a tentative ruling continuing the motions to compel further responses filed by the Defendant City of Baldwin Park. The Defendant filed three motions to compel further responses from the six Plaintiffs, but the Court found that each set of discovery should have been filed as a separate motion. The improper filing of the motions disrupted the balance of the Court's calendar and workload, and the Court ordered the Defendant to pay ten additional filing fees. The Court also warned that continued improper filing of motions may result in monetary sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 177.5. The motions to compel further are continued to August 20, 2024.
