And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court is continuing the motion to approve the PAGA settlement to August 8, 2024, due to the plaintiff's failure to explain why its release should extend to former and present spouses. The plaintiff is ordered to file a supplemental declaration addressing this issue by the hearing date. The court had previously denied the plaintiff's motion without prejudice and ordered clarification on the release extension. The plaintiff has filed a new motion, but it does not address the court's concerns.
