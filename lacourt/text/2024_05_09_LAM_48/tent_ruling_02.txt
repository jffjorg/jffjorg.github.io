  CASE NO.: 21STCV24001
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER CONTINUING MOTION TO APPROVE
  PAGA SETTLEMENT 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
May 9, 2024



 
On January 18, 2024, the Court
denied without prejudice Plaintiff’s Motion for Approval of PAGA Settlement.  The Court required Plaintiff to “(1) explain why
it would be proper for the Plaintiff’s release to extend to former and present spouses;
and (2) clarify whether a representative enhancement is requested.”  The Court also ordered that “[a]ny future revised
copies [of the Settlement Agreement] must be fully executed by all parties and Counsel
before the Court can grant approval.”
On
April 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed a new Motion for Approval of PAGA Settlement.  This motion includes a fully signed copy of the
Settlement Agreement and clarifies that “Plaintiff is not seeking a representative
enhancement in this matter.”  (Mahoney Decl.
¶ 25.)
However,
the new motion does not “explain why it would be proper for the Plaintiff’s release
to extend to former and present spouses,” as instructed.
Accordingly,
the Motion to Approve PAGA Settlement is CONTINUED to August 8, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.  No later than five court days before the hearing,
Plaintiff is ordered to file a supplemental declaration that explains why it would
be proper for the Plaintiff’s release to extend to former and present spouses.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 9th day of May 2024
