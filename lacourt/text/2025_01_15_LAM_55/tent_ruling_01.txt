  Case Number:  22STCV39548    Hearing Date:   January 15, 2025    Dept:  55 Karina Avalos vs. 3.99 Pizza Co., Inc.
22STCV39548
The Court rejects Plaintiff’s default judgment package. Pursuant
to CRC 3.1800(a), Plaintiff must use mandatory Judicial Counsel Form CIV-100 to
request court judgment. More fundamentally, the Complaint only requests damages
"according to proof" and therefore does not meet the notice
requirement of Code of Civil Procedure section 580. Becker v. S.P.V.
Construction Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 494 (“a prayer for damages according
to proof passes muster under section 580 only if a specific amount of damages
is alleged in the body of the complaint”). The lack of any specific amount of
damages requested in the Complaint means that Plaintiff will not succeed in
obtaining default judgment for any amount of money based on the current
pleading. Plaintiff would need to file and serve an amended complaint with a
specific amount of damages requested, and then proceed to default if Defendant
does not appear.
