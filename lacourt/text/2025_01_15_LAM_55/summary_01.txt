And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has rejected the plaintiff's default judgment package and has ordered the plaintiff to use the mandatory Judicial Counsel Form CIV-100 to request court judgment. The judge has also ruled that the plaintiff's complaint does not meet the notice requirement of Code of Civil Procedure section 580 because it only requests damages "according to proof" without specifying a specific amount. According to the judge, a complaint must specifically allege a specific amount of damages to meet this requirement. Therefore, the plaintiff will need to file and serve an amended complaint with a specific amount of damages requested before proceeding with a default judgment.
