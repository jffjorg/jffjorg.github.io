And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Lesser v. Department of Public Health, et al. The plaintiff, Lesser, filed a motion to have the RFAs (requests for admission) deemed admitted and for sanctions against the defendant, Department of Public Health, et al. The defendant opposed the motion and sought monetary sanctions.

The judge granted the motion's amended request for sanctions against the defendant and its counsel. The plaintiff is entitled to $1,720 in fees and costs. The defendant and its counsel must pay the sanctions within 30 days.

The judge also denied the defendant's request for relief from the waiver of objections to the RFAs. The defendant's late responses to the RFAs contained objections, which were waived under CCP Section 2033.280(a). The defendant did not make a showing of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect as the reason for the untimely responses, and therefore, the waiver stands.
