And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Sara Gutierrez's Motion to Set Aside Default. The Motion was filed on behalf of Defendant, who was served a Summons and Complaint on August 22, 2023, but failed to timely respond to the Complaint. The judge found that the Motion was properly denied on the merits, as Defendant did not provide a sufficient explanation for failing to respond to the Complaint. Additionally, the judge noted that the Motion was also denied due to procedural deficiencies, as Defendant failed to attach a copy of an answer or pleading proposed to be filed, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) sections 473.5 and 473(b). The judge ordered the opposing party to give notice of the ruling.
