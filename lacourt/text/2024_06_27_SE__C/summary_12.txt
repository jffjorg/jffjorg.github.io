Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for sanctions filed by MARIELA I. GARCIA, seeking sanctions under CCP §128.5 for BELMAN's allegedly frivolous motions for new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The court has denied the motion, finding that BELMAN acted in good faith in filing the motions, even if they were ultimately unsuccessful. The court notes that a showing of lack of merit alone is not enough to justify sanctions, and that the moving party must also demonstrate subjective bad faith or improper motive. In this case, the court has found no evidence of bad faith or improper motive on the part of BELMAN.
