And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action (battery) and the sixth cause of action (public nuisance) with 30 days leave to amend. The judge has overruled the demurrer to the third cause of action (intentional infliction of emotional distress). The judge has sustained the demurrer to the fourth cause of action (fraudulent concealment) with 30 days leave to amend.

The judge has also granted the motion to strike punitive damages with 30 days leave to amend. The judge has found that the plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to support a claim for battery and that the plaintiff has failed to plead specific facts to maintain a claim for punitive damages.

The judge has ordered the plaintiff to amend the complaint to cure the deficiencies identified in the demurrer and to plead specific facts to support the claims for battery, fraudulent concealment, and punitive damages.
