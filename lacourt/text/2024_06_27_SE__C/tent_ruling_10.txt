Global Enterprise, Inc. v. Everytable, PBC, Case No. 24NWCV00798
 
This is an
unlawful detainer action. Plaintiff moves ex parte to advance the hearing on
Defendant’s demurrer and two motions to compel further, which are currently set
for August 1, 2024.
 
A party may
seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing "irreparable
harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex
parte." (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c).)
Plaintiff does
not argue what harm would occur if the three motions are not advanced.
 
Based on the
above, the Court DENIES the motion.
