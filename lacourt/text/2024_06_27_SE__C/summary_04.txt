And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication filed by Defendant TRADEMARK HOIST & CRANE. The court has denied both motions, finding that there are triable issues of fact regarding whether Trademark Hoist & Crane owed a duty of care to the decedent, CESAR ALVARADO, and whether Trademark Hoist & Crane's training and supervision of Atlas Galvanizing employees was adequate.

The court found that Trademark Hoist & Crane provided training to Atlas Galvanizing employees, including training on safe rigging procedures, and agreed to provide crane operation and safety training classes to employees of Atlas Galvanizing. The court concluded that this training may have included training on how to safely handle materials when using the crane, and that it is reasonable to infer that Trademark Hoist & Crane owed a duty of care to the decedent.

The court also found that there are triable issues of fact regarding whether Trademark Hoist & Crane undertook to provide services to Atlas Galvanizing that directly relate to the accident that is the subject of this litigation, and whether Trademark Hoist & Crane's carelessness increased the risk of harm to the decedent. The court denied summary adjudication of both the first and second causes of action, allowing the case to proceed to trial.
