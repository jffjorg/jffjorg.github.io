Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted defendant Brightview Tree Services, Inc.'s motion for summary judgment in this premises liability case. The plaintiffs, Jerry McClenon, Kelly McClenon, and Dawn Kasarda, had alleged that the City of Cerritos and Brightview were liable for the death of David Walter McClenon, who died after falling on a defective public sidewalk. The judge found that Brightview did not owe a duty to the decedent to repair or maintain the public sidewalk, as there was no evidence that Brightview had undertaken such a duty. The judge also found that the subject sidewalk was not a dangerous condition. As a result, the judge granted Brightview's motion for summary judgment and denied the plaintiffs' request for judicial notice.
