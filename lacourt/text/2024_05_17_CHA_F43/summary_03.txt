And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge grants Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage Company's motion to compel plaintiff Sergey Vershinin's responses to requests for admission. The plaintiff's responses were unverified and did not comply with the Civil Code of Procedure. The Judge also orders the plaintiff and his counsel to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,950 for having to bring this motion. The Judge finds that this amount is reasonable considering the time spent by Coldwell's counsel on the motion.
