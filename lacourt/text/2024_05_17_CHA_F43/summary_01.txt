And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has granted the Plaintiffs' motion to stay all proceedings pending their appeal. The Plaintiffs filed the action on May 18, 2020, and one of the Defendants, San Francisco Townhomes Association, had its motion for summary judgment granted on November 1, 2023. The Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on December 22, 2023, and then filed the motion to stay all proceedings on January 8, 2024. The Judge's ruling is based on CCP § 916(a), which provides for an automatic stay of proceedings pending appeal. The Judge finds that the stay is necessary to protect the appellate court's jurisdiction and to preserve the status quo until the appeal is decided. The Plaintiffs' motion to stay all proceedings is granted, and the Court will set an appeal status hearing at a later date.
