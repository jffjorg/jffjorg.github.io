And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to vacate the default and default judgment. The defendants argued that they had technical difficulties with the remote appearance application and were unable to attend the hearing, which led to the default. However, the judge found that the defendants did not sufficiently demonstrate that the default was entered against them due to inadvertence, surprise, mistake, or excusable neglect. The judge also noted that the defendants' reasons for missing the hearing have changed, and no reason was given for Defendant Leilani Hernandez's failure to file an answer or otherwise appear. Additionally, the judge ruled that the plaintiff lacks a remedy if the default is vacated, as the plaintiff has already retaken possession of the property through the writ of possession. The judge cited several cases that stand for the proposition that a court cannot "undo" a sheriff executing on the judgment for possession.
