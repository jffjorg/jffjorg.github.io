The Judge's tentative ruling indicates that a Status Conference was held on April 10, 2023, where a court reporter was not present. The Judge questions whether any orders made by Judge Hsu would have been made during this hearing. The Judge also notes that Boudreau and BPC produced documents in a separate action, but this does not justify Boudreau's refusal to produce documents in the current case. The Judge expresses uncertainty over the discovery cut off issue and intends to resolve the dispute.
