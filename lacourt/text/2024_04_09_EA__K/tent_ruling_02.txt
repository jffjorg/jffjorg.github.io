[1]              Meritage’s counsel refers to Hsu’s
order as having been made on April 10, 2023. The April 10, 2023 minute order
reflects that a “Status Conference re: Stipulation/Non-Stipulation to Mandatory
Settlement Conference” was held on that date. There is no language in the April
10, 2023 minute order regarding the discovery cut off issue.


[2]              The March 27, 2023 minute order
reflects that a court reporter was present for the hearing. It appears to the
court that any order made by Judge Hsu would likely have been made during the
April 10, 2023 hearing, which was not attended by a court reporter; otherwise,
counsel could have easily resolved this dispute by requesting a copy of the
March 27, 2023 transcript from the court reporter and providing same to the
court.


[3]              Boudreau represents that on or
about May 12, 2023, he and BPC (through different counsel than Boudreau’s
counsel in the instant litigation) already produced certain documents in
Riverside Superior Court Case No. CVR12205532 (“The Riverside Suit”), including
the ESOP, a Stock Purchase Agreement, an ESOP Promissory Note and a
Modification to the Stock Purchase Agreement. (Cannon Decl., ¶ 11). It is
unclear, then, why he believes production of the ESOP should be withheld now.
Boudreau’s and BPC’s production of responsive documents in a separate action
does not justify Boudreau’s refusal to produce documents here.
