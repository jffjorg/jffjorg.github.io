And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendants. The demurrer challenges the correct amount due on a three-day notice. The judge rules that the demurrer is improper, as a demurrer does not assess the veracity of allegations. The judge also finds that the defendants' citations to previous cases are inapposite, as those cases addressed whether the service of termination of tenancy requirement(s) were met based upon evidence, whereas the present case involves a different issue. The judge relies on two previous cases, Kwok v. Bergren and Briggs v. Electronic Memories & Magnetic, to support their ruling.
