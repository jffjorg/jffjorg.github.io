And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by the Defendants, Dalia Martinez, David Felipe Martinez, Felipe Jesus Martinez, and Mariana Martinez, in an unlawful detainer action brought by Covina College Street, LLC. The demurrer was filed on the grounds that the three-day notice served on the Defendant was defective, failing to contain the information required by California Code of Civil Procedure §1161(2), and overstating the amount due. However, the Judge has ruled that the demurrer fails because it raises issues of law, not fact, and that lack of personal jurisdiction is not a ground for demurrer. The Judge has also deemed the Defendant's argument that the three-day notice was defective waived due to the lack of explanation of facts or information. As a result, the demurrer is overruled, and the Defendants are ordered to file an answer within 5 days of this order.
