   [1] For this reason—that a demurrer does not assess  veracity of the allegations—Defendants’ use of a demurrer to challenge the  correct amount due on the three-day notice is improper. (See Demurrer p. 4.) To  this point, Defendants’ citations are inapposite because the cases address  whether CCP section 1162 service of termination of tenancy requirement(s) were  met based upon evidence. (See e.g., Kwok v. Bergren (1982) 130  Cal.App.3d 596 [Issue before the court was “whether there was evidence before the trial court to  support its finding that appellants were properly served with the three-day  notice to pay rent or quit.”], emphasis added); see also Demurrer p. 4, citing  to Briggs v. Electronic Memories & Magnetic (1975) 53 Cal.  App.3d 900, 904 [Examined the evidence presented during a trial].)
