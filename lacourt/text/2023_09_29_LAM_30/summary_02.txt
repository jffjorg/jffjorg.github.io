And here is the summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the Reznick Defendants and JPMorgan Chase Bank. The Reznick Defendants demur to the fifth and seventh causes of action in the plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (SAC) and move to strike portions of the SAC. Chase moves to strike additional portions of the SAC.

The Court has previously sustained the Reznick Defendants' demurrer to the Fraud and Abuse of Process causes of action in the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint without leave to amend. The plaintiff has reasserted these causes of action in the SAC, along with re-pleading the same allegations that were previously subject to the Reznick Defendants' motion to strike.

The Court finds that the plaintiff's re-alleged causes of action relate to other defendants in the action, but this is irrelevant to the fact that the claims are improperly pled against the Reznick Defendants. The Reznick Defendants' demurrer is sustained without leave to amend and the motion to strike is granted.

Chase's motion to strike is also granted, as the subject allegations remain improper. The Court has previously sustained Chase's demurrer to the plaintiff's Complaint without leave to amend the first, ninth, and eleventh causes of action, and the plaintiff has reasserted these claims in the SAC.
