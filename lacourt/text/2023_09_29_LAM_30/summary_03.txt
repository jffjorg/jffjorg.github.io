And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, granting their motion to substitute Sam Leslie as the plaintiff in this action. The motion is allowed because the court may, in its discretion, allow an amendment to any pleading, including adding or striking out the name of any party, or correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect. The Uniform Voidable Transactions Act (UVTA) allows for the substitution of a new plaintiff when the original plaintiff no longer has standing. In this case, Defendant California Anesthesia Medical Consultants, Inc. (CAMC) filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, and Sam Leslie was appointed as the Chapter 7 Trustee. The judge finds that it is appropriate to substitute Sam Leslie as the real party in interest.
