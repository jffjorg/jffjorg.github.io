## English Summary:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the plaintiffs' motion to substitute the Chapter 7 Trustee for the bankrupt defendant in this case. 

The plaintiffs originally sued California Anesthesia Medical Consultants, Inc. (CAMC) under the Uniform Voidable Transactions Act (UVTA). However, CAMC filed for bankruptcy in March 2023, and Sam Leslie was appointed as its Chapter 7 Trustee.  

Under bankruptcy law, the Trustee takes ownership of any claims CAMC had before filing for bankruptcy.  Therefore, the plaintiffs are seeking to substitute the Trustee as the plaintiff in the lawsuit to ensure that the claim is properly prosecuted. 

The judge agrees with this request, citing case law that allows for amendments to pleadings to substitute a plaintiff with standing.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of Plaintiffs Howard Finn, M.D., Douglas Thom, M.D., and Ricky Lee Sedgwick, D.O. to substitute Sam Leslie, the Chapter 7 Trustee in Bankruptcy, as the plaintiff in this action. The motion is based on the Uniform Voidable Transactions Act (UVTA) and is granted because Sam Leslie has been appointed as the Chapter 7 Trustee for California Anesthesia Medical Consultants, Inc. (CAMC), the defendant, and has standing to pursue the UVTA claims. The court cites Haley v. Dow Lewis Motors, Inc.
