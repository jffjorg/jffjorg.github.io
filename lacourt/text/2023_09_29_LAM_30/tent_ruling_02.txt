al., Case No. 22STCV14601
 
Tentative
Ruling re Defendants’ Demurrer to Second Amended Complaint; Motions to Strike
 
Defendants Law Offices of Michael E. Reznick and Michael E.
Reznick (collectively, the Reznick Defendants) demur to the fifth and seventh
causes of action in Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint (SAC), and move to
strike portions of the SAC. Defendant JPMorgan Chase Bank (Chase) separately
moves to strike portions of the SAC.
 
The Reznick Defendants’ demurrer is sustained without leave
to amend and the motion to strike is granted. Chase’s motion to strike is
granted.
 
In reviewing the legal sufficiency of a complaint against a
demurrer, a court will treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions, or conclusions of law. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 (Blank); C & H Foods Co.
v. Hartford Ins. Co. (1984) 163 Cal.App.3d 1055, 1062.) It is well settled
that a “demurrer lies only for defects appearing on the face of the
complaint[.]” (Stevens v. Superior Court (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 594,
601.) “The rules by which the sufficiency of a complaint is tested against a
general demurrer are well settled. We not only treat the demurrer as admitting
all material facts properly pleaded, but also give the complaint a reasonable
interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.” (Guclimane Co. v.
Stewart Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38 (internal quotes
omitted).) For purposes of ruling on a demurrer, the complaint must be
construed liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from the facts pleaded. (Wilner
v. Sunset Life Ins. Co. (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 952, 958.) 
When ruling on a demurrer, the Court may only consider the
complaint’s allegations or matters which may be judicially noticed. (Blank,
supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 318.) The Court may not consider any other extrinsic
evidence or judge the credibility of the allegations plead or the difficulty a
plaintiff may have in proving his allegations. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson
(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881.) A demurrer is properly sustained only when the
complaint, liberally construed, fails to state facts sufficient to constitute
any cause of action. (Kramer v. Intuit Inc. (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 574,
578.) 
 
On March 28, 2023, the Court sustained the Reznick
Defendants’ demurrer to the Fraud and Abuse of Process causes of action in
Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint without leave to amend. The Court also
granted the Reznick Defendants’ Motion to Strike as to allegations concerning the
Reznick Defendants’ filing of litigation in the Los Angeles Superior Court and
Bankruptcy Court.
Despite the Court’s order, Plaintiffs have asserted the
Fraud and Abuse of Process causes of action against the Reznick Defendants in their
SAC. (SAC ¶¶ 76-88, 96-101.) Plaintiffs have also re-pled the allegations that
were subject to the Reznick Defendants’ motion to strike. (SAC ¶¶ 4(d), 34 [p.
19:12-21], 39, 42 [p. 26:11-13], 43(b), (d), and (h), 47(c) and (e), 77, 97,
106 [p. 47:13-18].)
 
Plaintiffs argue that the re-alleged causes of action
relate to other defendants in this action. But this is irrelevant to the fact
that the claims are improperly pled against the Reznick Defendants; both the
fifth and seventh causes of action are asserted “Against All Defendants Except
JPMorgan Chase Bank.” (SAC ¶¶ 76, 96.)
As the Court has previously noted, Plaintiffs’ argument
that they must re-allege the causes of action in subsequent amended complaints in
order to facilitate their appeal is incorrect. (National
Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA v. Cambridge Integrated Services Group,
Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 35, 45 [“such
pointless re-allegation is unnecessary to avoid waiver.”]; see Code Civ. Proc. § 472c, subd. (b).) Plaintiffs have
provided no cogent explanation for their continued inclusion of these claims
and allegations. Accordingly, the Reznick Defendants’ demurrer is sustained and
motion to strike is granted.
 
Chase moves to strike Paragraphs 45, 46, 47(f), 49(j) and
(k), 110, 111 [p. 49:2-3], 112, 113, 114 [p. 50:5:10], 116-120, 126-129, and
Prayer 2(j) and (k). The subject allegations are those relating to Chase under
Plaintiffs’ cause of action for “Preliminary Injunction, Permanent Injunction,
and Damages,” and Plaintiffs’ ninth and eleventh causes of action against Chase
for Negligence and Breach of Fiduciary Duty.
On October 11, 2022, the Court sustained Chase’s demurrer
to Plaintiffs’ Complaint without leave to amend the first, ninth, and eleventh
causes of action for preliminary injunction, negligence, and breach of
fiduciary duty. Plaintiffs reasserted those claims in their FAC, and on March
23, 2023, the Court granted Chase’s Motion to
Strike as to the allegations that were subject to the prior demurrer.
Plaintiffs have again included the same claims and allegations in their SAC,
and in support present the same arguments previously rejected by the Court. As
the allegations remain improper, Chase’s motion to strike is granted.
