English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for discharge and dismissal with prejudice, enjoining the defendants from further litigation regarding the disputed funds and awarding the plaintiff reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred in bringing this action. The judge finds that the plaintiff has a right to interplead the funds and that the defendants have a reasonable probability of double vexation. However, the judge concludes that the plaintiff's requested injunction is too broad and may affect the defendants' claims against the plaintiff in an ongoing action, Care Plus Medical Group, Inc. v. Law Offices of Michael E. Reznick, et al. (22STCV14601). The judge orders that the injunction be more narrowly worded to avoid affecting the defendants' claims in Care Plus. The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for an award of attorney's fees and costs, citing the court's discretion to deny such an award under Code of Civil Procedure section 386.6. The judge will make a final decision on the matter at the conclusion of the Care Plus action.
