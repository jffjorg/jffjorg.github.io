```

English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for discharge and dismissal with prejudice, enjoining the defendants from further litigation regarding the disputed funds and awarding the plaintiff reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred in bringing this action. The judge finds that the plaintiff has a right to interplead the funds and that the defendants have a reasonable probability of double vexation. However, the judge concludes that the plaintiff's requested injunction is too broad and may affect the defendants' claims against the plaintiff in an ongoing action, Care Plus Medical Group, Inc. v. Law Offices of Michael E. Reznick, et al. (22STCV14601). The judge orders that the injunction be more narrowly worded to avoid affecting the defendants' claims in Care Plus. The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for an award of attorney's fees and costs, citing the court's discretion to deny such an award under Code of Civil Procedure section 386.6. The judge will make a final decision on the matter at the conclusion of the Care Plus action.

**English Summary:**

The Judge is considering dismissing Chase from the current lawsuit and preventing the other parties involved from suing Chase again about the disputed funds. 

The Judge agrees that Chase should be dismissed, but thinks the proposed injunction preventing further lawsuits against Chase is too broad. This is because a separate lawsuit (Care Plus) is already underway against Chase related to the same funds. The Judge wants to make sure the injunction doesn't interfere with that case.

The Judge is also hesitant to award Chase its attorney's fees at this time because it's not yet clear whether Chase is responsible for the dispute. This will be decided after the Care Plus case concludes.

Law Offices of Michael E. Reznick et al. The court has also noted that the injunction should not affect Chase's liability in the Care Plus action.
