```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court is considering a motion for reconsideration of its earlier decision sustaining the County's demurrer. The Plaintiffs argue that the Court should reconsider its decision based on new information. However, the Court finds that the Plaintiffs' motion is procedurally improper because the Court entered judgment in favor of the County on the same day the Plaintiffs filed their motion. Additionally, the Court finds that the Plaintiffs have not presented any "new or different facts, circumstances, or law" that were not or could not have been presented at the earlier hearing. The Court therefore denies the motion for reconsideration.
