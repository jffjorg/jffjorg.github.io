And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees and costs, but without a multiplier. The plaintiff's attorneys seek to recover $66,478.50 in fees, including $39,319 in fees incurred to date and an additional $5,000 in fees to review opposition, prepare a reply, and attend the hearing. The court reduces the permitted charges for reviewing the opposition, preparing the reply, and attending the hearing from $5,000 to $500. The court finds that $39,819 in attorneys' fees was reasonably and necessarily incurred. The court declines to award a multiplier, concluding that a multiplier would not be fair.
