And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

Based on the evidence presented, the court has denied the application for a writ of attachment against Jason McKeever's real property located at 6592 Horseshoe Lane in Huntington Beach. The court finds that the property is no longer owned by the defendant, and therefore, attachment is not proper. The court declines to consider the other arguments advanced in the opposition papers, as they are not necessary to a resolution of the merits of the motion. The parties are reminded that there is a case management conference scheduled for today, and counsel are required to appear remotely.
