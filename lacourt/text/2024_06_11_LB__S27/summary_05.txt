The Judge's tentative ruling is a summary of the case and the proposed settlement between the Plaintiffs, Marvin Tarver and Z.B. (a minor), and the Defendants, Maria DeLosAngeles and Gonzalez Macias. The Plaintiffs seek damages for an automobile accident, while the Defendants seek indemnification, contribution, and declaratory relief. The Judge reviews the proposed settlement, which provides for the payment of $15,000 to Tarver and $15,000 to Z.B., with 50% of the payment to Tarver going towards attorneys' fees. The Judge notes that the petition to approve the settlement is not properly completed and requires correction before the hearing. The Judge also notes that the proposed order lacks a box checked and will require correction. The Judge will grant the petition if the petition is amended properly prior to the hearing and if the Plaintiffs and Petitioner testify to the satisfaction of the Court at the hearing.
