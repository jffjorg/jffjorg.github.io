Case Number: 23LBCV00385
Hearing Date: June 11, 2024
Dept: S27

Background Facts:

  - Defendants: Kelvin Anderson, Sr., Rhone Love, and World Famous VIP Records, LLC
  - Plaintiff filed the original complaint on 2/27/23
  - Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint on 5/17/23
  - Plaintiff filed the Second Amended Complaint on 2/01/24

Demurrer:
  - Legal Standard: A demurrer raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party's pleading
  - A demurrer can challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable
  - The Court must assume all facts pleaded in the complaint are true, however improbable they may be
  - The Court will give effect to specific factual allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent general or conclusory allegations

Meet and Confer:
  - Defense Counsel declares the parties met and conferred telephonically, but were unable to resolve the issues presented by the demurrer

Parties' Positions:
  - Defendants argue the parties' agreement is an unenforceable agreement to agree and does not contain sufficiently definite terms to be enforced
  - Defendants argue the statute of limitations bars the SAC

Agreements:
  - The parties' agreement is attached to the SAC as Exhibit A
  - The agreement is ambiguous and can be interpreted in favor of the party pleading the existence of the contract
  - The Court finds the parties' agreement is ambiguous and therefore extrinsic evidence can be introduced to further explain the terms of the contract

Statute of Limitations:
  - The four-year statute of limitations applies
  - The parties agree that the SOL begins to run when the agreement is breached
  - The Court finds the SAC does not show a bar based on the failure to make payments
  - The allegations have been omitted from the SAC, and the earlier admissions are "read into" the amended complaint

Intentions:
  - The Court intends to grant leave to amend if and only if Plaintiff can plead around her earlier allegations in a manner that saves the complaint from the statute of limitations

Facts:
  - The parties' agreement was breached, and Plaintiff was never paid anything per the parties' agreement
  - The entity defendant was making a profit, and the profit was generated between 2017 and 2023
  - The profit was due to Plaintiff and not paid

Disputes:
