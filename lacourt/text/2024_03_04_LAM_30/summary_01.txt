And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint for professional negligence. The demurrer is overruled, and the defendants are ordered to answer the complaint within 10 days. The judge finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a cause of action for professional negligence against the defendants. The judge also rejects the defendants' argument that the first cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations, as the plaintiff filed the complaint within the allowed timeframe. Additionally, the judge rejects the defendants' argument that the plaintiff failed to mitigate damages, as this is not relevant to determining the sufficiency of the complaint. The judge also notes that the defendants' motion to strike a paragraph from the complaint is improper, as it does not provide adequate notice or specify the grounds for the motion.
