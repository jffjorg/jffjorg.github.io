  Case Number:  23PSCV03001    Hearing Date:   June 4, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative
Ruling
 
Plaintiffs’ Application for Default Judgment is DENIED
without prejudice because (1) Lease ended February 27, 2023, yet
Plaintiff seeks damages for March 2023 and (2) insufficient evidence to support
damages. Upon submission of a renewed request for entry of
default judgment, Plaintiff need only submit an amended supplemental
declaration that addresses the court’s concerns.
 
Background
 
This case arises from a breach of a lease agreement. 
 
On September 28, 2023, Plaintiff Art Weiss, Inc. filed suit
against Defendants Movepro, LLC, a California limited liability company,
Sukhbatullo Nurov, Denis Andriutsa, Rakhimzhan Yussupov for: (1) Common Counts
(2) Breach Of Contract (3) Breach Of Written Guaranty (4) Breach Of Written
Guaranty (5) Breach Of Written Guaranty. 
 
On January 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed a POS indicating that
all Defendants were served on 1/24/2024 via publication.
 
On March 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed a ‘Notice of
Disassociation of Attorney’ indicating that 
Attorney, Dominic V. Marino, of the Law Office of Dominic V. Marino, is
no longer associated as counsel for Plaintiff, Art Weiss, Inc.
 
On May 16, 2024, default was entered against all Defendants.
That same day, Plaintiff filed the instant request for entry of default
judgment. 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff seeks entry of default judgment in the total
amount of 63,646.10 against all Defendants, which includes $53,368.27 in
damages and $5,891.86 of interest at the annual rate of 10%. The court finds
the following two defects with the application. 
 
1.    
Defendants
Do Not Appear to be Liable When They Vacated by the End of the Lease 
According to the complaint, the Lease entered was entered in
on 2/21/2022. (Complaint ¶
11.) “On or around March 24, 2023, Plaintiff discovered
that Defendants vacated the Premises during the month of March 2023,
without paying rent for March 1, 2023, and without giving Plaintiff written
notice of their vacancy. The only form of notice that was received by Plaintiff
was a voice message from an employee of Defendant Movepro, on March 24, 2023,
stating that Movepro moved out of the Premises. Plaintiff treated the March 24,
2023, voice message, as Movepro’s notice of termination of the Lease.” (‘Declaration
Of Plaintiff In Support Of Application For Entry Of Default And Judgment
Pursuant To C.C.P. § 585 (D)’ (“Plaintiff’s Declaration”), ¶22, p. 5, emphasis added.) 
 
However, it is uncertain whether Defendants are liable
for rent after March 2023 when the lease term ended on February 28,
2023. (‘Declaration Of Michelle Patterson Regarding 1) Summary Of Case; 2)
Memorandum Of Costs; 3) Pre-Judgment Interest; And 4) Attorney’s Fees; In
Support Of Default Judgment Pursuant To C.C.P. §585 And Cal. Rule Of Court
3.1800(A)’ (“Counsel’s Declaration”) ¶4,
p. 2.) Plaintiff’s declaration is unclear as to whether
Defendants vacated prior to March 1, 2023 or if they vacated on March 24, 2023;
it is only clear that Plaintiff learned of the vacancy on March 24, 2023.

 
To the extent that the lease was somehow modified by the
Clerk’s entry of Default Judgment—Unlawful Detainer on January 26, 2023 (due to
Defendants not holding a business license), Plaintiff provides no explanation. 
 
2.    
 Insufficient Evidence 
Even assuming Defendants are liable for March 2023, base
rent is $17,820.00 per month, Plaintiff seeks $51,913.10 for ‘Costs to restore
the Premises to marketable condition.’ (Plaintiff’s Declaration, ¶27, p. 6.) Plaintiff, however, has not proved
up said cost (i.e., explained the specific costs and provided
respective evidence (e.g., receipts). It is up to plaintiff to “prove up” the
right to relief, by introducing sufficient evidence to support his or her
claim. Without such evidence, the court may refuse to grant a default judgment
for any amount, notwithstanding defendant's default. (Taliaferro v. Hoogs (1963) 219 CA2d 559, 560, 33 CR 415, 416; Holloway v. Quetel (2015) 242 CA4th 1425, 1434-1435, 195 CR3d 920, 927-928.)
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing two defects, the application is
denied without prejudice.
