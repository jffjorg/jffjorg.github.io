And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is to deny the Plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The court finds two defects in the application. Firstly, the lease agreement ended on February 27, 2023, and the Plaintiff seeks damages for March 2023, which is uncertain. Secondly, the Plaintiff has insufficient evidence to support the damages claimed. The court requires the Plaintiff to submit an amended supplemental declaration that addresses the court's concerns.
