Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants Defendant's motion to compel arbitration of Plaintiff's claims, and stays all further proceedings in this case until the completion of arbitration proceedings. The judge declines to award Defendant attorney fees, citing California Supreme Court cases that hold that prevailing in an interim procedural step, such as a motion to compel arbitration, does not entitle a party to attorney fees. The judge also declines to award Plaintiff attorney fees, given insufficient evidence to show obstruction and delay by Defendant. The case is consolidated with another case, Case No. 22STCV40951, and the judge's ruling applies to both cases.
