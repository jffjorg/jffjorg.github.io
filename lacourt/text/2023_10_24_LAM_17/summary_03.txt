And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case between Irma Ordaz (plaintiff) and General Motors, LLC (defendant). The plaintiff moved to compel discovery responses to her Requests for Admission (RFAs), but the judge finds that the motion is moot because the defendant has since responded to the RFAs. The judge also declines to award sanctions at this time because the plaintiff failed to meet and confer with the defendant in good faith to resolve the dispute. The judge notes that the plaintiff did not attempt to communicate with the defendant or its counsel to discuss the matter, but instead simply filed the motion. The judge concludes that the Discovery Act demands more by way of meet and confer, and therefore finds the plaintiff's motion to compel discovery responses to be moot. The ruling is tentative and may be adopted as the final order if all parties submit on it by the deadline.
