GLOBAL SECURITY VISION,

 Case No.: 
  21STCV38864
 
 
 
 Hearing Dated: October 19, 2023



 
            After review, the Court has identified the following deficiencies:
 
-        
Plaintiff’s
declaration must be clarified to resolve any perceived inconsistencies with his
memorandum of points and authorities. For example, Plaintiff claims that he was
never given a single meal or rest break. Yet, in his declaration, his
statements are somewhat equivocal saying, “During my employment with GLOBAL
VISION, I was not allowed to take meal breaks. In the instances I was not
provided with a timely meal break, I was not paid a meal break premium for
on-duty breaks” and “During my employment with GLOBAL VISION, I was not allowed
to take rest breaks. In the instances I was not provided with a timely rest
break, I was not paid a rest break premium for on-duty breaks.” If Plaintiff
was never given a meal or rest break he must explicitly state this, as he did
with his clear statement “I was never paid overtime.”
 
-        
Plaintiff must
explain how the $484,210.00 figure in the proposed order was calculated. By the
Court’s calculation, the numbers set forth in the brief total $800,971 in
damages. Even subtracting the $300,000 in general damages and $300,000 in
punitive damages would leave $200,971.00 in damages.
 
-        
Plaintiff must
explain how the figures of $300,000 in general damages and $300,00 was punitive
damages were settled upon. 
 
-        
CRC rule 3.207
provides that attorney fees awarded on default must be determined in accordance
with Local Rule 3.214.
