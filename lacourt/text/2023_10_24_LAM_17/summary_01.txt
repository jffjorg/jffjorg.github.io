Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the Archdiocese of Los Angeles' motion for summary judgment. The court finds that the Archdiocese did not own or control the Facility, and therefore did not owe a duty of care to Nalleli Cobo-Uriarte. The court also finds that the Archdiocese did not operate the Facility or any component of oil and gas production, and that Nalleli Cobo-Uriarte and her mother did not have information or knowledge of the Archdiocese's involvement in the operation of the Facility. The court concludes that the Archdiocese's knowledge of the dangerous condition posed by the Facility was not enough to create a duty of care, as the Archdiocese did not have the ability to obviate the condition. The court notes that this conclusion disturbs notions of justice and public policy, as the Archdiocese received royalties from the production that was destroying the surrounding community.
