This tentative ruling addresses several deficiencies in the Plaintiff's (Chidiebere Njoku) declaration and proposed order. The Court requires clarification of the declaration to resolve perceived inconsistencies with the memorandum of points and authorities. Specifically, the Court asks Plaintiff to explicitly state whether he was never given a meal or rest break during his employment with Global Security Vision, Inc. Additionally, the Court requests explanation of how the damages figure of $484,210.00 was calculated, which appears to be inconsistent with the total damages claimed of $800,971.00. The Court also asks Plaintiff to explain how the figures of $300,000.00 in general damages and $300,000.00 in punitive damages were settled upon. Finally, the Court reminds the Plaintiff that attorney fees awarded on default must be determined in accordance with Local Rule 3.214.
