And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Howard Weiss vs. SNF Manager, Inc. and Mecebar, LLC. The defendant's motion to compel arbitration is granted, and the action is stayed pending the completion of arbitration proceedings. The plaintiff does not dispute that the claims should be arbitrated, and the defendant's attempts to delay arbitration have been unsuccessful. The judge also denies the defendant's request for attorney fees, citing California Supreme Court precedent that prevailing in an interim procedural step is not sufficient to award fees. The case will proceed to arbitration, and the parties are required to submit on the tentative ruling by email by 4 p.m. the day prior to the hearing.
