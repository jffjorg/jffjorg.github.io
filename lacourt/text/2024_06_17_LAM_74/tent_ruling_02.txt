 Case Number:  24STCV04764    Hearing Date:   June 17, 2024    Dept:  74 Joseph  Edwards, et al. v. American Tax Service, et al. Specially Appearing Defendant Elite  Sales Solutions, LLC’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons.   The  court overrules Specially Appearing Defendant Elite Sales's boilerplate  objections to Michael Taylor’s declaration because boilerplate objections are  legally insufficient. All other objections are preserved. Plaintiff  alleges he suffered discrimination while employed by Elite Sales Solutions  beginning in the fall of 2023. The record contains a September 27, 2023 letter  filed with Nevada authorities in November 2023 on Elite Sales Solutions  letterhead signed by Elite Sales Solutions president Ethan Liss constituting a  party admission. The letter states Elite Sales Solutions “began operations in  California in January 2018 and expanded into Nevada 2021.” The letter further  states Elite Sales Solutions is “in the process of expanding our operations in  Nevada, away from California” but does not say Elite Sales Solutions had  shuttered its California operations as of September 2023. The  court denies Specially Appearing Defendant Elite Sales Solution’s motion to  quash. Elite Sales Solutions shall file and serve its response to plaintiff’s  complaint within 20 days. Elite  Sales Solutions shall give notice.
