And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Joseph Edwards, et al. v. American Tax Service, et al., regarding Specially Appearing Defendant Elite Sales Solutions, LLC's motion to quash service of summons. The court finds that boilerplate objections to Michael Taylor's declaration are legally insufficient and overrules them. The court preserves all other objections. The record contains a September 2023 letter from Elite Sales Solutions, which constitutes a party admission and shows that the company began operations in California in 2018, expanded into Nevada in 2021, and is currently expanding operations in Nevada. The court denies the motion to quash and orders Elite Sales Solutions to file and serve its response to the plaintiff's complaint within 20 days, with notice.
