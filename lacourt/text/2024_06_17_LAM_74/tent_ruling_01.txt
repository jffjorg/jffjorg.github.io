  Case Number:  19STCV02964    Hearing Date:   June 17, 2024    Dept:  74 Vasile
Properties Airport Plaza LLC v. FAA Beverly Hills, Inc.
Plaintiff Charles Vasile’s Motion to
Tax Costs.
 
BACKGROUND 
            The
court entered judgment  on the special
verdict for Defendant FAA Beverly Hills Inc. dba Beverly Hills BMW on February
9, 2024.  On February 26, 2024, Defendant
filed its Memorandum of Costs, seeking to recover $31,048.03 in costs. On March
12, 2024, Plaintiff Charles Vasile (“Plaintiff”) filed his motion to tax costs.

            All
evidentiary objections are preserved.
            The
court exercises its discretion to disregard any defect in timeliness of
Plaintiff’s service of its motion because the short delay (if any) was de
minimis and non-prejudicial.
Plaintiff
seeks to tax the following categories: (1) item 1 in the amount of $2,315; (2)
item 5 in the amount of $1,089.50; (3) item 11 in the amount of $225.85, and
(4) item 14 in its entirety, i.e. $2,160.30.
With
regard to item 1, Plaintiff seeks to tax costs associated with the filing fees
of motions that Defendant had filed that were denied or withdrawn, which
amounts to $2,315. (Motion at pp. 2-3.) However, the recovery of filing fees
are generally recoverable. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a)(1).) While Plaintiff
asserts that many of Defendant’s motions were withdrawn and some were denied,
this does not preclude recovery for these costs because Plaintiff has not shown
that Defendant pursued these motions incompetently or in bad faith. (City of
Sacramento v. Drew (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1287, 1303.) Thus, Plaintiff has
not met his burden in showing that they were not reasonable or necessary.  (Ladas v. California State Automotive
Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-774.) Therefore, the court declines
to tax item 1 in the amount requested. 
As
to item 5, Plaintiff asserts that it was unnecessary for Defendant to spend
$1,089.50 in unsuccessfully attempting to serve witness Victor Mora with trial
subpoenas because Mr. Mora’s deposition testimony was ultimately admitted into
trial. (Motion at pp. 3-4.) The court agrees. Even though Defendant argues that
it was obligated to serve Mr. Mora with a trial subpoena pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure § 2025.620(c)(2)(E), Defendant’s decision to attempt to serve
Mr. Mora eleven times with a trial subpoena is excessive and was not
reasonable. Instead, the court finds that the trial subpoenas that Defendant
had attempted to serve on Mr. Mora on February 6, 2023, May 23, 2023, and June
28, 2023 were reasonable. Thus, item 5 of Defendant’s Memorandum of Costs is
taxed in the amount of $805.50.
With
regard to item 11, Plaintiff seeks to tax this category in the amount of
$225.85 because the copying expense includes documents other than exhibits
found within the trial binders and some exhibits were not presented to the
jury. (Motion at pg. 4.) However, the preparation of the trial binders are
determined to be reasonable and necessary for the “conduct of litigation,”
regardless of whether they were presented before the jury. (Heppler v. J.M.
Peters Co.¿(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1265, 1298–1299.) Additionally, whether an
exhibit is used at trial is not dispositive; the proper standard is whether the
exhibits “were reasonably helpful to aid the trier of fact.” (County of
Riverside v. City of Murrieta (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 616, 629.) Thus, the
court declines to tax item 11. 
Last,
Plaintiff seeks to tax item 14 in its entirety because e-filing fees in the
amount of $2,160.30 are excessive. (Motion at pg. 5.) This argument is not
persuasive. In Los Angeles County, electronic filing has been mandated for
Non-Complex Unlimited Civil cases where litigants are represented by counsel
since January 2, 2019. (See First Amended General Order filed May 3, 2019; see
also CRC, rule 2.253(b.) Also, while
the individual invoices were not included with the Memorandum of Costs,
verification of the memorandum of costs by the prevailing party’s attorney
establishes a prima facie showing that the claimed costs are proper. (Jones
v. Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1266.) To overcome this prima
facie showing, the objecting party must introduce evidence to support its claim that the costs are not reasonably
necessary. (Id. at pp. 1267-1268.) Because the memorandum has
been verified by Defendant’s attorney, the claimed costs are proper.
Accordingly, the motion to tax is granted in part
and Defendant’s costs are taxed in the amount of $805.50.
 
CONCLUSION 
The
court grants in part Plaintiff Charles Vasile’s motion to tax costs in the
amount of $805.50.  Consequently,
Defendant is entitled to recover $30,242.53 in costs. 
Plaintiff
shall give notice.
