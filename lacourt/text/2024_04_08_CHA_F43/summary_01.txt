And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to specially prepared interrogatories and sanctions the defendant. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant has not provided meritorious responses to the interrogatories, which relate to the defendant's affirmative defenses. The plaintiff argues that the defendant's objections to the interrogatories are not specific and are too general. The judge finds that the defendant's responses to the interrogatories are not complete and straightforward and are a misuse of the discovery process. The judge orders the defendant to submit verified, code-compliant responses to all of the plaintiff's specially prepared interrogatories. The judge also grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,111.65 against the defendant, which was based on 3.5 hours at $300 an hour and $61.65 in costs.
