SUMMARY OF
ACTION
On January 4,
2024, Plaintiff Cecilia Thompson (Plaintiff) served Defendant Kyle Perez (Defendant)
with Special Interrogatories, Set One. Responses to the interrogatories were
due on or before February 8, 2024. Defendant failed to serve any responses by
the deadline. On February 13, 2024, Plaintiff served a meet and confer letter
on Defendant advising of the failure to respond and requesting verified
responses by February 20, 2024. No responses were ever received by Plaintiff.
Plaintiff’s counsel attempted to call Defendant on March 6 and 7, but Defendant
did not answer. Plaintiff filed this motion on March 8, 2024. Plaintiff seeks an
order compelling responses to the special interrogatories. Plaintiff also seeks
sanctions in the amount of $2,315 against Defendant. No opposition has been
filed to Plaintiff’s motion.
 
ANALYSIS
The propounding
party may move for an order compelling responses and monetary sanctions if a
party to whom the interrogatories are directed fails to respond. (CCP §§ 2030.290,
2030.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) Responses to interrogatories
are due within thirty days from the date of service of the interrogatories. (CCP
§§ 2030.260(a), 2016.050.) The responding party waives any objections to the
interrogatories by failing to serve responses in a timely manner. (CCP § 2030.290(a).)
 
Defendant has
failed to respond to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories. Plaintiff has moved
for an order compelling Defendant’s response to these Interrogatories. The
Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to the Special
Interrogatories.
 
Sanctions
CCP § 2023.030
authorizes the Court to issue sanctions against a party engaging in conduct
that is a misuse of the discovery process. Failure to respond to discovery,
evasive responses, and objections lacking substantial justification are
“misuses of the discovery process.” (CCP § 2023.010, subd. (d)-(f).)
 
Plaintiff has
requested sanctions in the amount of $2,315 against Defendant for having to
bring this motion. The amount was based on Plaintiff’s counsel spending 1.1
hours preparing the motion at $550 an hour, plus an anticipated 3 hours
reviewing Defendant’s opposition and preparing a reply, plus the $60 filing
fee. (Alexander Decl., ¶ 7.) Because no opposition was filed, it was
unnecessary for Plaintiff to review the opposition or prepare a reply beyond
the notice of non-opposition. Therefore, the Court will not assess the
additional 3 hours requested by Plaintiff. That means that the sanctions would
be 1.1 hours at $550 an hour, plus the $60 filing fee, for a total of $665 in
sanctions. 
 
Plaintiff’s
requests for sanctions against Defendant is granted in the amount of $665 for
this motion.
 
ORDER

motion to compel responses to special interrogatories is granted.
2.      Defendant
is ordered to serve responses within twenty (20) days.
3.      Defendant
is ordered to pay sanctions in the total amount of $665. Defendant is ordered
to pay these sanctions to Plaintiff’s counsel within twenty (20) days.
