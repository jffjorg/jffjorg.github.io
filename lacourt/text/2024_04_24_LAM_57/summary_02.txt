Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Fernandez's motion to compel further responses to his discovery requests, but denied his request for monetary sanctions against Zebra and its counsel. The court found that Fernandez has demonstrated good cause for the requests, which seek documents related to the hiring process of Zebra's Manager Manufacturing position. The court rejected Zebra's objections to the requests, finding that they are relevant to Fernandez's contention that Zebra hired Sibigtroth to cover up its age discrimination against Fernandez. The court also denied Fernandez's request for sanctions, finding that Zebra's position in this discovery dispute was substantially justified.
