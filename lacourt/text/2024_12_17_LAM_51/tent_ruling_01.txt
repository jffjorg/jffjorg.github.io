  Case Number:  24STCV13922    Hearing Date:   December 17, 2024    Dept:  51 Tentative Ruling   Judge Upinder S.  Kalra, Department 51   HEARING DATE:   December  17, 2024                                            CASE NAME:           Karla  Huff v. Wilson Sporting Goods Co.   CASE NO.:                24STCV13922    DEMURRER   MOVING PARTY:  Defendant  Wilson Sporting Goods Co.   RESPONDING PARTY(S): Plaintiff Karla Huff   REQUESTED RELIEF:    1.      Demurrer  to the First Cause of Action for failure to state a claim. TENTATIVE RULING:    1.      Demurrer  to the Complaint is SUSTAINED with leave to amend; STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:    On June 3, 2024, Plaintiff Karla Huff (Plaintiff) filed a  Complaint against Defendant Wilson Sporting Goods Co. (Defendant) with one  cause of action for Violations of the California Trap and Trace Law (Cal. Penal  Code § 638.51).   According to the Complaint, Plaintiff visited Defendant’s  website on January 9, 2024 and Defendant deployed software created by TikTok to  uncover Plaintiff’s identity. Plaintiff alleges this software is a trap and  trace device.    On August 22, 2024, Defendant filed the instant demurrer. On  December 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition.[1]  On December 10, 2024, Defendant filed a reply.   LEGAL STANDARD:    Evidentiary  Objections   The court is unaware of any legal authority which requires a  court to rule on evidentiary objections on a motion, except as to a motion for  summary motion/adjudication or a special motion to strike (CCP § 437c (q);  CCP § 425.16 (b)(2); see also, Sweetwater  Union High School Dist. v. Gilbane Building Co. (2019) 6 Cal.5th 931,  947-949.) The court respectfully declines to rule on any of these objections.  The court is well aware of the rules of evidence, and to how much weight, if  any, should be given to any of the proposed evidence.   Request  for Judicial Notice   The court DENIES Defendant’s request for judicial notice.   Meet  and Confer   Prior to filing a demurrer, the demurring party is required  to satisfy their meet and confer obligations pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc.  (CCP) §430.41 and demonstrate that they so satisfied their meet and confer  obligation by submitting a declaration pursuant to CCP §430.41(a)(2) & (3).     Still, failure to meet and confer is not a sufficient ground  to overrule or sustain a demurrer. (CCP § 430.41(a)(4).)¿   Demurrer   A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint  states a cause of action.¿(Hahn v. Mirda¿(2007)  147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the  allegations liberally and in context.¿In a demurrer proceeding, the defects  must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)  116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the  evidence or other extrinsic matters. …. The only issue involved in a demurrer  hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous  matters, states a cause of action.”¿(Hahn¿147  Cal.App.4th at 747.)¿    ANALYSIS:    First Cause of  Action - California Invasion of Privacy Act, Penal Code § 638.51   Defendant contends that Plaintiff insufficiently alleged  that Defendant deployed a trap and trace device and insufficiently alleged  non-consent. Plaintiff argues she sufficiently alleged a claim and alleged she  did not consent to TikTok obtaining her information from Defendant’s website.  Specifically, Plaintiff argues that Defendant improperly adds requirements to  the statute that do not exist, that she alleged use of software rather than use  of cookies, that she did not allege the software is a pen register device, and  that she alleges she did not consent to the taking of her information.  Defendant replies the legislative history supports their interpretation that  CIPA does not apply to the act of visiting a website and that Plaintiff did not  allege how Defendant did not obtain her consent.   CIPA § 638.51(a) provides: “Except as provided in  subdivision (b), a person may not install or use a pen register or a trap and  trace device without first obtaining a court order pursuant to Section 638.52  or 638.53.”  (Pen. Code §638.51(a).) Consent of the user is an  absolute defense. (Id. at  subd.(b)(5).)   Penal Code section 638.50 defines a trap and trace device as  “a device or process that captures the incoming electronic or other impulses  that identify the originating number or other dialing, routing, addressing, or  signaling information reasonably likely to identify the source of a wire or  electronic communication, but not the contents of a communication.” (Pen. Code  § 638.50.)    Upon reviewing the Complaint, Plaintiff insufficiently  alleged a claim for violation of Penal Code § 638.51. First, Plaintiff did  sufficiently allege she did not consent. (Complaint ¶¶ 19, 21, 27.) Second, as  alleged, the TikTok Software falls within the plain meaning of a “trap and  trace” device as defined under Penal Code section 638.50. The statute defines a  trap and trace devices as “a device or process that captures the incoming  electronic or other impulses that identify the originating number or other  dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information reasonably likely to  identify the source of a wire or electronic communication, but not the contents  of a communication.” (Pen. Code, § 638.50, subd. (c).) An electronic  communication is further defined as “any transfer of signs, signals, writings,  images, sounds, data, or intelligence of any nature in whole or in part by a  wire, radio, electromagnetic, photoelectric, or photo-optical system.” (Pen.  Code, § 629.51, subd. (a)(2).) Plaintiff’s allegations fall within the plain  meaning of the statute: Plaintiff has alleged that the TikTok software is a  device that captures incoming electronic impulses that are reasonably likely to  identify the source of an electronic communication, including device, browser,  and geographic information. (Complaint ¶¶ 11-15, 17.) Plaintiff has  sufficiently pled the first element of a violation of the Trap and Trace Law.[2]  However, Plaintiff did not allege that Defendant acted “without first obtaining  a court order.”   Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS Defendant’s demurrer with  leave to amend.   CONCLUSION:               For  the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows:    1.      Demurrer  to the Complaint is SUSTAINED with leave to amend; within 21 days of this  ruling. Moving party is to give notice.    IT IS SO ORDERED.    Dated:              December 17, 2024                 __________________________________                                                                                                                Upinder  S.
