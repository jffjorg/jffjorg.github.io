And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Upinder S. Kalra, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Karla Huff v. Wilson Sporting Goods Co., Case No. 24STCV13922. The case involves a demurrer filed by the defendant, Wilson Sporting Goods Co., to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Karla Huff, alleging a violation of the California Trap and Trace Law (Cal. Penal Code § 638.51).

The judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the complaint fails to state a claim and the plaintiff has the opportunity to revise and refile the complaint. The judge's ruling is based on the argument that the plaintiff insufficiently alleged a claim for violation of Penal Code § 638.51, specifically that the plaintiff did not allege that the defendant acted "without first obtaining a court order" as required by the statute.

The judge also declined to rule on certain evidentiary objections raised by the defendant and denied the defendant's request for judicial notice. The case is set to be heard on December 17, 2024.
