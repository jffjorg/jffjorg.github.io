And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the plaintiff's citation of a Los Angeles Superior Court trial court order in their argument. The judge prohibits the citation of unpublished decisions, citing California Rule of Court, rule 8.115(b). The judge also warns the parties that this practice has become a disturbing trend since legal research websites began publishing superior court orders. The judge notes that simply because a superior court order is easily searchable and found on the internet does not make it a published decision that can be cited or relied upon as authority. The judge intends to impose sanctions if the practice persists. Additionally, the judge notes that a factual dispute exists regarding whether visiting a website constitutes two-way communication, which will be resolved at summary judgment.
