   [1]Here, Plaintiff quoted extensively from a Los Angeles  Superior Court trial court order. This is prohibited. California Rule of Court,  rule 8.115(b), prohibits citing or relying on unpublished decisions except for  reasons not applicable here. Second, “A written trial court ruling in another  case has no precedential value. ” (Budrow  v. Dave & Buster’s of California (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 875, 885; Bolanos v. Superior Court (2008) 169  Cal.App.4th 744, 761; In re Molz  (2015) 127 Cal.App.4th 836, 845; Santa Ana Medical Hospital Center v. Belshé  (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 819, 831.) Plaintiff’s malfeasance is not isolated. This  has become a disturbing practice by practitioners since  legal research websites began “publishing” superior  court orders. The fact that a superior court order is easily searchable and  found on the internet does not magically transform the order into a published decision  that can be cited or relied upon as authority. The parties are warned. If this forbidden  practice persists, the court will issue an order to show cause on why sanctions  should not be imposed.    [2]  Whether visiting a website is not two-way communication is a factual dispute  more appropriately resolved at summary judgment.
