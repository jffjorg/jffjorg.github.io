This is a dispute between neighbors in Beverly Hills as to the validity and use of an easement. On August 13, 2021,  Ronald J. Hale, trustee of the Hale Family Trust (“Hale”), filed a First Amended Complaint against Danielle Festa and Benedict Cawood for (1) injunctive relief, (2) trespass, and (3) declaratory relief. Hale alleges that “Defendants have attempted to exert exclusive possession over the Easement and have erected gates, fences, and appurtenances thereto that unreasonably restrict Plaintiff’s ability to use the Easement. The usable width of the Easement has been reduced from 10 feet to approximately 8.5 feet - a 15% reduction. This reduction makes it unreasonably difficult for a car to travel through the Easement and impossible for trucks or emergency vehicles. Defendants have also objected to Plaintiff’s free and unrestricted use of the Easement for himself, his workers, and guests. Defendants have threatened to remove Plaintiff’s mailbox which is at the entrance to the Easement and where Plaintiff’s mail has been delivered since he acquired the Property in 1970 and has likely been there since the 1920's when the house was built. Defendants threaten and assert that they will continue to trespass, and therefore continue to deprive plaintiff of plaintiff's right to free and unrestricted use of the Easement.”On September 14, 2021, Festa and Cawood filed a Cross-Complaint against Hale for (1) declaratory relief and (2) quiet title.Cross-Complainants allege that “the property owned by the Cross-Defendant has access to a public road and therefore the easement is unnecessary. Additionally, Cross-Defendants have abandoned the purported easement by building and using an alternate driveway for ingress and egress from the Cross-Defendant’s property for decades.”Hale now seeks summary judgment or, alternatively, summary adjudication of all causes of action in the Cross-Complaint.The law of summary judgment provides courts “a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.”  (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  In reviewing a motion for summary judgment or adjudication, courts employ a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent’s claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue.”  (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.)  The moving party bears the initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue, in which case the burden shifts to the opposing party to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(p)(2).)  To show a triable issue of material fact exists, the opposing party may not rely on the mere allegations or denials of the pleadings, but instead must set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.  (Aguilar, at p. 849.)  Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.”  (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)Cross-complainants had actual notice of Hale’s existing interest in the driveway/easement when they acquired the Property.  (SUF nos. 14, 40.)  Cross-complainants also had constructive notice of Hale’s interest because of the prior recorded 1962 Grant Deed.  (SUF nos. 15, 41.)The 1962 grant deed indicates that the subject easement is “for the purpose of ingress and egress to and from that portion of the property immediately adjoining the land herein granted on the east, which portion is commonly described as 9810 Easton Drive, such easement to be for the benefit of said land and the present owners thereof, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, likewise, in perpetuity.”  It appears undisputed that this easement is appurtenant, meaning that it runs with the land.  Cross-Complainants’ assertions as to necessity lack merit.  “When a grantor conveys land shut off from access to a road by the grantor's remaining land, or partly by his land and partly by that of a stranger, a way of necessity arises over the adjoining land of the grantor.”  (Mesmer v. Uharriet (1916) 174 Cal. 110, 112)  Here, an easement by necessity is not at issue; rather, this is a case about an express easement, the scope of which is determined by the language of the instrument at issue.  (Civ. Code § 806; see also Elliott v. McCombs (1941) 17 Cal.2d 23, 28.)  Thus, the fact that Hale has another method of entering and exiting his property is not dispositive in any way.Similarly, Cross-Complainants also argue that the easement was abandoned: “HALE does not need to use the Easement to access his property and has not used the Easement as a driveway for ingress or egress for more than a decade. During at least the last ten years HALE has used Rimmele Drive (which intersects Easton Drive and is just past the entrance to the Easement) to access 9810, not the Easement.”“Abandonment of an easement created by grant, as here, requires proof of (1) the cessation of use of the easement by the owner of the dominant tenement and (2) unequivocal and decisive acts on the part of the [dominant tenant], clearly showing an intention to abandon. (Gerhard v. Stephens (1968) 68 Cal.2d 864, 890, 69 Cal.Rptr. 612, 442 P.2d 692 (Gerhard); Smith v. Worn (1892) 93 Cal. 206, 212, 28 P. 944.) An easement that is found to be abandoned does not revert to the grantor[;] it is simply extinguished. (Concord & Bay Point Land Co. v. City of Concord (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 289, 295, 280 Cal.Rptr. 623.) [¶] Abandonment, and in particular the intent to abandon, are issues of fact. (People v. Ocean Shore Railroad, Inc. (1948) 32 Cal.2d 406, 417, 196 P.2d 570; Buechner v. Jonas (1964) 228 Cal.App.2d 127, 131, 39 Cal.Rptr. 298.) With respect to this inquiry, California has adopted the view of the original Restatement of Property that [t]he intention required in the abandonment of an easement is the intention not to make in the future the uses authorized by it. The benefit of an easement lies in the privilege of use of the land subject to it. There is no abandonment unless there is a giving up of that use. (Faus v. City of Los Angeles (1967) 67 Cal.2d 350, 363, 62 Cal.Rptr. 193, 431 P.2d 849 (Faus); see similarly Tract Development Services, Inc. v. Kepler, supra, 199 Cal.App.3d at p. 1385, 246 Cal.Rptr. 469 [Abandonment hinges upon the intent of the owner to forego all future conforming uses of the property]; Ocean Shore, at p. 418, 196 P.2d 570 [trier of fact must determine whether there was a bona fide intent to preserve the right of way for actual railroad use].) Although mere nonuse is insufficient to demonstrate an intent to abandon, a long period of nonuse may be considered as evidence of the necessary intent.”  (Visitacion Inv., LLC v. 424 Jessie Historic Properties, LLC, 92 Cal.App.5th 1081, 1090 (internal quotation marks omitted.)Cawood and Festa admit in their opposition that “HALE uses the easement for additional mail service, additional trash service, as an occasional entrance for workers . . . .”  Based on this assertion, it is undisputed that Hale has been using the easement for ingress and egress to the extent that Hale’s workers and mailmen use it to access Hale’s estate.  No reasonable juror could find abandonment under the circumstances here.Because the subject easement is valid and has not been abandoned, the quiet title claim lacks merit.  The declaratory relief claim is mostly derivative of the quiet title claim, but also requests that to “the extent the easement does exist and has not been abandoned the scope of the easement is subject to dispute as a judgment was entered on April 10, 1972, affecting the purported easement . . . .”  Cross-Complainants have failed to identify any dispute as to scope that would require a declaration from this Court.  Notably, Hale acknowledges that “[t]here is no dispute and Hale agrees that his workers should not park on the easement or leave trash on it.”  He also “agrees that he has no right to [trespass around Cross-Complainants’ gate]. There is also no dispute that, pursuant to the 1972 Judgment, Cross-complainants have the right to install a gate on the easement at the bottom of the driveway, which they have done.”  These issues are, thus, moot.  The only other issue is apparently whether the size of Cross-Complainants’ gate/fence is proper.  However, this inappropriately relates to a past controversy (Osseous Techs. of Am., Inc. v. DiscoveryOrtho Partners LLC (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 357, 366), and/or the declaratory relief claim is superfluous relative to Hale’s trespass claim, which asks the same question.  Therefore, the Motion for Summary Judgment is granted.   The objections are overruled.  The RJN are granted.Moving party to give notice.
