And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted Coastal's anti-SLAPP motion and awarded attorneys' fees of $9,492 to Coastal and the Nyes, the prevailing parties. The Court finds the fee request to be reasonable and has denied the defendants' request to amend the judgment to change the title and date of the post-judgment interest. The Court has also denied the request to quash outstanding levies issued under the interim judgment. The Court's previous rulings have rejected the defendants' claims that the judgment lien was invalid and premature.
