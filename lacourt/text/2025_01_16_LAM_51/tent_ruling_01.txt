STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On November 17, 2023, Plaintiff Bianca Martinez (Plaintiff)
filed a Complaint against Defendants Cube World USA Inc., Cube World USA, LLC,
and Kevin Maxwell (Defendants) with eight causes of action for: (1) Sexual
Harassment; (2) Failure to Prevent Harassment; (3) Assault; (4) Sexual Battery;
(5) Retaliation / Wrongful Constructive Termination; (6) Constructive Discharge
in Violation of Public Policy; (7) Failure to Provide Accurate Wage Statements;
and (8) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.
 
According to the Complaint, Plaintiff worked for Defendants
as an executive assistant where she experienced unwanted, severe, and/or
pervasive sexual harassment. Plaintiff further alleges that due to this conduct
she had not choice but to resign. Plaintiff also alleges labor law violations.
 
On March 18, 2024, Defendants filed an Answer.
 
On September 19, 2024, Counsel Adli filed the instant
Motions to be Relieved as Counsel for Defendants Cube World USA Inc., Cube
World USA LLC, and Kevin Maxwell. Oppositions were due on or before January 3,
2025. As of January 10, 2025, the court has not received any opposition.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.¿¿
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284,¿subd. (b).)¿ An attorney is permitted to withdraw
where conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to
continue the representation.¿ (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).)¿
“The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel
lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court¿(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court
3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court 3.1362(c)), and MC-053
(Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court 3.1362(e)).¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court
3.1362(d).)¿ The court may delay effective date of the order relieving counsel
until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has been
filed with the court.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court 3.1362(e).)¿¿ 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Counsel indicates that irreconcilable differences have
arisen with each Client making it unreasonably difficult to carry out the
representation. Counsel indicates that Defendants were each personally served
with the motions. However, there is no proof of service on file with the court.
 
Accordingly, the court CONTINUES the motions to be
relieved as counsel to allow Counsel the opportunity to file adequate proof of
service.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Motions
to be Relieved as Counsel are CONTINUED to January 29, 2025 at 9:00 a.m.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
