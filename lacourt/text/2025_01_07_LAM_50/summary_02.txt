And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a request by State Farm General Ins. Co. (Plaintiff) for a default judgment against Yasmine Kanvour and others (Defendants). The Plaintiff seeks a total of $172,796.96, consisting of $151,194.01 in damages, $21,054.00 in interest, and $548.95 in costs. The judge finds that the Plaintiff has provided sufficient evidence to support its request. However, the judge notes that a complaint or cross-complaint was not filed on November 17, 2022, as mentioned in the Request for Court Judgment. Instead, the operative First Amended Complaint was filed on February 17, 2023. The judge allows the Plaintiff to correct this error before the hearing, and if the defect is corrected, the judge will grant the request and sign the proposed judgment.
