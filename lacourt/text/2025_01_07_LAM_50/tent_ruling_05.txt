PLAINTIFF DENIS
  CAMAS’S MOTION FOR A PROTECTIVE ORDER SHIELDING HIM FROM DEFENDANT’S MISUSE
  OF SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES AND SANCTIONS AGAINST DEFENDANTS AND COUNSEL,
  JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY, IN THE AMOUNT OF $3,035.00
 



 
Plaintiff Denis
Camas (“Plaintiff”) moves “for an order protecting him from Defendant Puretek
Corporation’s…improper use of Special Interrogatories…” 
Plaintiff’s motion will be continued to a
new date as set forth below. NO HEARING WILL TAKE PLACE ON JANUARY 7,
2025.    
Pursuant to the
Court’s power to “amend and control its process and orders so as to make them
conform to law and justice” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(8)), the Court
orders the parties in this case to participate in a meet and confer with the
Court (“Informal Discovery Conference” or “IDC”). Lead or other designated
counsel for the parties with full authority are ordered to participate in
person in an IDC. After consulting with opposing counsel regarding available
dates, Plaintiff must make a prompt reservation for the IDC using the Court’s
online reservation system. Plaintiff must file Dept. 50’s one-page IDC form in
the department seven days prior to the IDC, and the responding parties may file
the same form in the department setting forth a response three days prior to
the IDC.¿ ¿¿¿
Once Plaintiff has
confirmed an IDC date, Plaintiff must use the Court’s online reservation system
to continue the motion to a post-IDC discovery hearing date. The parties are
ordered to have with them whatever materials are needed to make the IDC session
productive and successful. Prior to the IDC date, lead or other designated
counsel for the parties, with full authority, are to meet and confer, in
person or via telephone in a further attempt to resolve as
many of the issues as possible before the IDC. (See CRC Rule 3.670,
subd. (f)(2).) If the parties resolve their discovery disputes before the IDC
date, Plaintiff is ordered to take both the IDC and the motion off calendar as
soon as possible.¿¿ 
Plaintiff is
ordered to provide notice of this Order.¿¿
