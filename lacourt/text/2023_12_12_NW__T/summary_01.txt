Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer to the second amended complaint filed by the defendants, Arpy Gouloomian and RP&A LLC, against the plaintiff, Minas Michael Avsharian. The demurrer challenged the sufficiency of the pleading in the complaint, specifically the first cause of action for breach of lease, the third and fourth causes of action for negligent and intentional misrepresentation, and the fifth cause of action for conspiracy to defraud.

The judge found that the first cause of action for breach of lease failed to plead sufficient facts to support the element of breach because the plaintiff had alleged that the defendant was no longer in privity, possession, or control of the lease extension or the property at the time of the breach. The judge also found that the plaintiff had failed to cure the pleading defect from a prior demurrer to an earlier version of the complaint.

The judge sustained the demurrer to the third and fourth causes of action for negligent and intentional misrepresentation because the plaintiff had failed to plead sufficient facts to show that the defendant's misrepresentation caused the harm resulting from the refusal to enter into the extension. The judge also sustained the demurrer to the fifth cause of action for conspiracy to defraud because it was insufficiently pled as an independent claim.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change after further briefing and argument.
