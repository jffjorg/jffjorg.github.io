And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay the action. The defendant, Veritas Global Protection Services, Inc., argued that the Guard Service Contract, which was purchased by the plaintiff, Kenneth Nwobi, includes an arbitration agreement that covers the plaintiff's claims. The defendant asserted that it is the "distributor" of the contract on behalf of Old Republic Insured Automotive Services, Inc., and that this role is included in the definition of "we" in the arbitration agreement. The plaintiff disputed the defendant's standing and argued that the terms "we" and "us" in the contract refer to Old Republic, not the defendant. However, the defendant provided evidence that it is a "distributor" for Old Republic, which is included in the definition of "we". The Judge has found that the defendant has sufficiently overcome the plaintiff's dispute as to standing and has granted the motion to compel arbitration and stay the action. The arbitration status conference is set for 2024.
