  Case Number:  23VECV00077    Hearing Date:   December 12, 2023    Dept:  T 23VECV00077 MINAS MICHAEL
AVSHARIAN, AN... vs ARPY GOULOOMIAN
[TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Defendant Arpy Gouloomian’s Demurrer to the
Second Amended Complaint is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.  
Introduction 
Defendant Arpy Gouloomian
(Defendant) demurred to Plaintiff Minas Michael Avsharian’s (Plaintiff) Second
Amended Complaint (SAC).  Defendant’s
demurrer placed into issue the first cause of action (COA) for breach of lease,
the third COA for negligent misrepresentation, the fourth COA for intentional
misrepresentation, and the fifth COA for conspiracy to defraud.
Discussion  
Defendant argued that the first
COA for breach of contract failed to allege the existence of a contract due to
conflicting factual allegations made in the fraud claims.  This issue was raised previously at the
demurrer to the First Amended Complaint (FAC). 
Despite Defendant’s argument otherwise, the uncertainty as to the
allegation of the existence of a contract was cured in the SAC because the
factual allegations related to the alleged fraud in extending the lease is now
made “upon information and belief.”  (See
SAC pars. 49-51.)  By making the factual
allegations “upon information and belief,” the factual allegations are no
longer to be in conflict but seen to be alternative grounds to plead the tort
claims.  Plaintiff cured the prior
pleading defect and the demurrer is unpersuasive.
Defendant then argued that the
first COA failed to plead sufficient facts to support the element of breach
because Plaintiff pled facts showing that Defendant was no longer in privity,
possession, or control of the lease extension or the property.  Plaintiff alleged that ownership of the
property transferred from Defendant to Co-Defendants 14936 Ventura LLC (14936
Ventura), Triwell Properties, Inc. (Triwell), and James Wellbaum (Wellbaum).  (SAC par. 21.)  Plaintiff then alleged that it was these
Co-Defendants that failed to repair the property after an August 13, 2022
accident.  (SAC par. 23.)  Plaintiff then allegedly received the Notice
to Terminate on September 8, 2022 wherein Plaintiff alleged that Co-Defendant
14936 Ventura intended to occupy the property. 
(SAC par. 24-27.)  Plaintiff did
not dispute the argument other than to argue in a conclusory manner that the
SAC sufficiently pled facts to support the COA. 
Plaintiff did not argue or present any new facts to show that the defect
can be cured.  There is insufficient
pleading of facts to support the element of breach by Defendant.  The failure/refusal to honor the lease
extension and/or repair the property after the accident is only alleged against
Co-Defendants 14936 Ventura, Triwell, and Wellbaum in that the facts alleged
show that Defendant no longer owned, possessed, or controlled the property at
the time of the breach.  Because there
are insufficient facts pled to support the element of breach against Defendant,
the demurrer is persuasive.
The demurrer to the first COA is
SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
As to the third and fourth COAs
for negligent and intentional misrepresentation, the Court previously ruled
that the FAC failed to allege sufficient facts as to the causation
element.  As previously pled, Plaintiff’s
SAC alleged that Defendant misrepresented that the lease was extended for three
years.  (SAC pars. 17-18, 46-47, 49,
58-59, and 61.)  Plaintiff alleged that
his harm was being prevented from access to the property due to Co-Defendants
14936 Ventura, Triwell, and Wellbaum refusal to honor the extension.  (SAC pars. 23-27, 55, 65.)  Plaintiff further alleged that Defendant told
Co-Defendants 14936 Ventura, Triwell, and Wellbaum that Plaintiff could be
evicted at the consummation of the sale. 
(SAC par. 20.)  Defendant’s
alleged duplicity could be sufficient to plead causation in Plaintiff’s loss of
a lease.  However, Plaintiff further pled
that Co-Defendants 14936 Ventura, Triwell, and Wellbaum also had knowledge of
the three-year extension but decided to purchase the property anyway and
subsequently terminate the lease early. 
(SAC par. 20.)  With the
additional fact pleading of Co-Defendants 14936 Ventura, Triwell, and Wellbaum
knowledge of the three-year extension, Plaintiff has not pled sufficient facts
to show that Defendant’s misrepresentation caused the harms resulting from the
refusal/failure to enter into the extension. 
These allegations are the same allegations made in the prior FAC.  (See FAC pars. 21, 23-25, 45-46, 54, 57-58,
and 64.)  Because there are no new facts
pled to support the element of causation, Plaintiff failed to cure the pleading
defect from the prior demurrer to the FAC. 

The demurrer to the third and
fourth COAs is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
The fifth COA for conspiracy to
defraud is insufficiently pled because it is not an independent COA.  Without sufficient pleading of the two fraud
claims, the conspiracy claim is not sufficiently pled.
The demurrer to the fifth COA is
SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
