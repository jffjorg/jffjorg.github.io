 Case Number:  22STCV02646    Hearing Date:   April 24, 2024    Dept:  30 ELPIDIO RIOS vs CP V CUMULUS, LLC, A LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY, et al.TENTATIVEPlaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside the Dismissal is GRANTED.The Court calendars in 90 days an OSC re dismissal for failure to file proof of service of summons and complaint pursuant to CRC rule 3.110(b) and (f).Legal StandardCode of Civil Procedure §473(b) provides for mandatory and discretionary relief from dismissal. “The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” CCP §473(b). Where such an application for discretionary relief is made, the motion shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or pleading proposed to be filed, or the application will not be granted. (Id.) The court must grant relief from dismissal where the application is accompanied by an attorney affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. (Id.) In either case, the application must be made within a reasonable time, and in no case exceeding six months after the judgment. (Id.)DiscussionPlaintiff moves for relief from the dismissal under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b)’s mandatory and discretionary prongs, arguing his counsel inadvertently failed to calendar the Final Status Conference and trial dates.Here, the motion is timely filed. The action was dismissed on July 21, 2023. This Motion to Set Aside the Dismissal was filed on January 22, 2024. January 21, 2024 was a Sunday. Since Sunday is a holiday, the period of six months would be extended to and including January 22, 2024. (Code Civ. Proc., § 12a; Bell v. Krauss (1915) 169 Cal.387, 391-392.) In Jimenez v. Chavez (2023) 97 Cal.App.5th 50, the Court held that six months is measured by the longer of 182 days or six calendar months. Here, the motion was filed within 6 months of the dismissal.The trial court’s granting or denial of relief under this provision is reviewed for abuse of discretion. (State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Pietak (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 600, 610.) It is noted that appellate courts are traditionally “favorably disposed toward such action on the part of the trial courts as will permit, rather than prevent, the adjudication of legal controversies on their merits.” (Mercantile Collection Bureau v. Pinheiro (1948) 84 Cal.App.2d 606, 608, citing Benjamin v. Dalmo Mfg. Co. (1947) 31 Cal.2d 523.)Plaintiff moves for relief on the ground that dismissal was entered due to the mistake, inadvertence, or neglect of Plaintiff’s counsel. On July 21, 2024, the entire action was dismissed without prejudice, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 581(b)(3), when Plaintiff did not appear Non-Jury Trial. Counsel for Plaintiff provides a declaration signed under penalty of perjury, attesting that he failed to appear for the trial date because it was not properly calendared in his calendar. (Ghahreman Decl., ¶ 3.)The Court finds that Plaintiff’s counsel has sufficiently established mistake, inadvertence or neglect and the dismissal must be set aside.ConclusionPlaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside the Dismissal is GRANTED.
