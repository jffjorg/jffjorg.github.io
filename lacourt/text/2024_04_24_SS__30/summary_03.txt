And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the action. The plaintiff's counsel inadvertently failed to appear for the non-jury trial date, which resulted in the dismissal of the action. The plaintiff's counsel has provided a declaration under penalty of perjury attesting to the mistake. The judge finds that the plaintiff's counsel has sufficiently established mistake, inadvertence, or neglect and the dismissal must be set aside.
