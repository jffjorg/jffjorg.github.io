 Case Number:  23SMCV01463    Hearing Date:   May 16, 2024    Dept:  I The motion for reconsideration is DENIED.  The motion for relief from waiver is
GRANTED.  Sanctions are DENIED. 
 
Plaintiffs filed a quiet title action.  Defendant Johnson’s motion for
reconsideration and relief from waiver are before the court.  Plaintiff opposes both.  Underlying the motions is discovery served on
November 22, 2023, to Johnson.  Johnson
did not respond and meet and confer requests were ignored.  The court granted the resulting motion to
compel and to deem the RFA’s admitted. 
The court also granted mandatory sanctions.  Johnson seeks reconsideration of those
orders.  That request is denied.  Johnson does not provide a legally acceptable
basis for the motion.  There is no new
law cited.  There are no new facts about
which Johnson did not know at the time. 
Simply put, there is no basis for reconsideration.  (Morris v. AGFA Corp. (2006) 144
Cal.App.4th 1452.) 
 
The motion for relief from waiver is different.  No brand new facts need be asserted for that;
all Johnson needs to do is present evidence of excusable neglect.  In that regard, the court is aware that
Johnson is self-represented.  While
Johnson is still held to the Code of Civil Procedure, the court also
understands that the Code is a bit difficult to navigate for the uninitiated.  Johnson should still have met and conferred,
but the court can at least understand how we came to be here.  The court also notes the extreme result of
deeming the RFA’s to be admitted.  That
could be a case-ender.  Under appropriate
circumstances, relief from waiver would still be denied.  But in this case, the court exercises its
discretion to allow Johnson to file substantive answers, without objection,
within 10 court days.  Other than not
getting a free win, the court sees no prejudice to plaintiff other than the
cost of the motion, which was dealt with in the prior motion.  Accordingly, all requests for sanctions are
DENIED.
