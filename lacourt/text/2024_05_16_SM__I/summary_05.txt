And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the motion for reconsideration and grants the motion for relief from waiver. The plaintiff filed a quiet title action, and the defendant Johnson filed motions for reconsideration and relief from waiver. The court granted a motion to compel and deem replies to requests for admission (RFA's) admitted, and also granted mandatory sanctions. Johnson seeks reconsideration of these orders, but the court finds no basis for reconsideration. The court notes that Johnson is self-represented and acknowledges that the Code of Civil Procedure can be difficult to navigate. The court grants Johnson's motion for relief from waiver, allowing Johnson to file substantive answers without objection within 10 court days. The court denies all requests for sanctions.
