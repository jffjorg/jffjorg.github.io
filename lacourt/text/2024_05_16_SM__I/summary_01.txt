The judge's tentative ruling excludes the expert testimony from Albert and Hirschkorn due to methodological and attribution issues. The ruling states that the plaintiff has not shown causation and attribution of damages, and that the analysis by Hirschkorn was flawed due to assumptions and lack of rigor. The judge also notes that the plaintiff is seeking more than compensatory damages, which is difficult to show.
