This tentative ruling addresses a motion to seal and a motion for sanctions in the case of 22SMCV00598. The court grants the motion to seal in part and denies the motion for sanctions. The court continues to apply the test for sealing documents and considers the importance of the information to the court's resolution of the demurrer. The court believes that some information in the declaration should remain redacted, but allows the rest to be publicly disclosed. The court warns the parties that if the demurrer is overruled, more information may be placed on the public record. The court grants a limited sealing order and orders the plaintiffs to re-file their papers with 10 court days.
