And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses several issues relevant to the upcoming court hearing. The defendant's reference to a First Amended Complaint is erroneous, and the court notes that Plaintiff may seek leave to file an amended complaint if new facts are discovered during the discovery phase that support a claim for punitive damages. The court also highlights that it cannot determine who Charles Lorenzo is, including his relation to the defendant or plaintiff, based on the Complaint alone. The ruling concludes that Plaintiff may seek leave to file an amended complaint if new facts are discovered, but the court's decision to grant leave will depend on the particulars of the motion.
