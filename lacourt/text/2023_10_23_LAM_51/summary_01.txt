And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike the portions of the complaint that seek punitive damages. The plaintiff had alleged that the defendant wrongfully terminated her employment due to her pregnancy, and that the defendant's actions were intentional and malicious. However, the court found that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages. The court also found that the plaintiff did not plead facts that show the defendant's employee(s) engaged in conduct that meets the requirements for punitive damages under California Civil Code Section 3294.

The court's ruling is based on the complaint and the evidence presented, and it is a tentative ruling, meaning it is subject to change after further consideration and argument.
