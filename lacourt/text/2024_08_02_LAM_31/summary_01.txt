  "A terminating sanction is a 'drastic measure which should be employed with caution.'" (Deyo, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793)
  "Evidence sanctions are warranted. Because Defendant did not file an opposition, Defendant fails to present any evidence or argument that the violation of the court order was not willful."
