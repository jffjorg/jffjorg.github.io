I. BACKGROUND¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿ 
¿ 
On December 27, 2022, Plaintiff, Julia Misley
(formerly known as Julia Holcomb) (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against
Defendant Doe 1, and DOES 2 through 50. On February 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendant, Steven Victor Tallarico aka
Steven Tyler, and DOES 2 through 50. The FAC alleges causes of action for: (1)
Sexual Battery – Civil Code § 1708.5; (2) Sexual Assault; and (3) Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress. 
 
The FAC is based on Plaintiff’s allegations that she
is a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, sexual battery, assault, and
molestation at the hands of Defendant, Steven Victor Tallarico aka Steven Tyler
(“Defendant”). Plaintiff alleges that when she was 16 years old, Defendant used
his role, status, and power as a well-known musician and rock star to gain
access to, groom, manipulate, exploit, sexually assault Plaintiff over the
course of over three years in numerous states across the country, including
California. 
 
On March 12, 2024, this Court heard Defendant’s
Special Motion to Strike pursuant to Section 425.16 (Anti-SLAPP Motion) and ruled
in part in favor of Defendant. As such, Defendant now brings a Motion for
Attorneys’ Fees, seeking time billed to Defendant for both the anti-SLAPP
motion and this Fee Motion. 
 
B. Procedural¿¿ 
¿ 
On May 13, 2024, Defendant
filed this Motion for Attorneys’ Fees. On June 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
opposition brief. On June 7, 2024, Defendant filed a reply brief.  Each has supporting declarations.
¿II.
ANALYSIS¿ 
 
A.    Legal
Standard 
 
Attorney’s fees are recoverable when
authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.
(a)(10).)  Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(10), attorney fees when authorized by contract,
statute or law are allowable as costs and may be awarded upon a noticed motion
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (c)(5).  Here, the fees are awardable by statute, the anti-SLAPP
special motion to strike statute upon which Defendant prevailed as to the portions
of the IIED cause of action.
 
In determining what fees are reasonable,
California courts apply the “lodestar” approach. (See, e.g., Holguin v. DISH
Network LLC (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1332.) This inquiry “begins with
the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate.” (See PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095.) From there, the “[t]he lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based
on consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at
the fair market value for the legal services provided.” (Ibid.) Relevant
factors include: “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2)
the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of
the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, [and] (4) the
contingent nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1132.) 
 
The party seeking fees has the burden of
documenting the appropriate hours expended and hourly rates. (City of Colton
v. Singletary (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 751, 784.) This burden requires
competent evidence as to the nature and value of the services rendered. (Martino
v. Denevi (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) A plaintiff’s verified
billing invoices are prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and
services listed were necessarily incurred. (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167
Cal.App.3d 677, 682.)
 
B.    Discussion
 
Defendant’s
moving papers indicate that he has incurred $142,493 in defending against Plaintiff’s
claim, and anticipates an additional $12,930 will be incurred for the fee
motion, reply and argument (totaling $155,423). 
In Plaintiff’s opposition brief, she argues that Defendant’s lodestar
amount of $155,423 is not reasonable, and that this Court should reduce claimed
hours sought. As such, Plaintiff raises three different issues, as discussed
below. 
 
Time
Statements Submitted by Defense Counsel 
 
            First, Plaintiff argues that there
are indications that the verified time statements submitted by defense counsel
are erroneous and/or unreliable. Plaintiff also states that the redactions
prevent her from assessing the action. One example Plaintiff gives is that on
March 31, 2023, KHIKS Partner, Katherine Kleindienst billed 0.2 hours, to
“[r]eview and analyze [a] revised memorandum re proposed anti-SLAPP motion,”
but that according to the billing entry on April 4, 2023, the revised
memorandum on the proposed motion did not exist until four (4) days later.  The Reply papers dispel the assertion that this
negligible time entry demonstrates billing fraud or that the time statements
are unreliable, and that instead the billing entries demonstrate that
Kleindienst began working on the anti-SLAPP memo on March 20, 2023, so the memo
did indeed exist a week earlier than the March 31 time entry.
 
Second,
Plaintiff argues that on January 26, 2024, Squire Senior Associate Hannah
Makinde (1) prepared and appeared for an ex parte hearing, (2) drafted the
notice of ruling on the ex parte hearing, (3) analyzed the cases cited in
Plaintiff’s opposition to Defendant’s anti-SLAPP motion, and (4) worked on the
first draft of Defendant’s reply to Plaintiff’s opposition. Plaintiff contends
that for those four tasks, Makinde billed 0.5 hours, but Senior Partner Adam
Fox then billed 2.5 hours to review and revise the initial draft. Plaintiff
argues that it is unlikely that there was enough of a draft for Fox to spend so
much time reviewing. 
 
            On January 27, 2024, Plaintiff also
notes that Makinde spent nine (9) hours working on Defendant’s reply brief, but
Squire partners spent only 8.1 hours reviewing and revising the second draft.
Plaintiff argues that this is significantly disproportionate to the 2.5 hours
Fox billed for reviewing and revising the first, assumedly much shorter draft. Plaintiff
contends that the significant disproportionality between the time entries is
noteworthy. In Defendant’s Reply papers, they noted that Makinde also worked on
the reply brief both before and after January 26, 2024, each day from January
24, 2024 to January 27, 2024, recording 12.5 hours to that task. 
 
            Third, Plaintiff argues that the
most clearly erroneous record within Defendant’s time statements is from March
8, 2024, when Marvelle Moore billed 2 hours for the “analysis and review of
video footage submit[ted] by plaintiff in response to [the anti-SLAPP] motion.”
Plaintiff argues that she has never, throughout the entire course
of this litigation, not just the anti-SLAPP motion, submitted a single video to
Defendant. Based on the above, Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s time
statements should not be entitled to absolute credence and cannot alone
constitute prima facie evidence that the time spent was either necessary or
reasonable.  Once again, the Reply papers
dispel this claimed erroneous or claimed fraudulent billing entry. The Reply notes
that Moore actually spent two (2) hours analyzing video footage of Plaintiff, which
was provided to the Court in a thumb driver, and likely made a typographical error
in his time entry – replacing the word “by” for “of”. 
 
But these are not
the only grounds for the challenges to the $155,000 in fees being claimed.  
 
Number of
Hours Defense Counsel Seeks Being Compensated
 
            Next, Plaintiff argues that the
number of hours for which Defense counsel sees to be compensated is not
reasonable. Plaintiff lists the purported amount of time spent on the
anti-SLAPP motion (not including the Fee Motion) by each individual listed
which includes: 
 
1.     Katherine
Kleindienst: 58.8 hours -  $38,220 
2.     Alan
Kossoff: 25.1 hours  - $17,570 
3.     Shawn
Holley: .5 hours - $425 
4.     Katharine
Liao 1 hour - $1,222.5, at $1,300 per hour 
5.     Carmen
Cole 24 hours - $18,620.5, at $855 per hour 
6.     David
Long-Daniels 22.6 hours - $29,267, at $1,295 per hour
7.     Adam
Fox 7.4 hours - $11,470, at $1,550 per hour 
8.     Hannah
Makinde 16.8 hours - $12,096, at 720 per hour 
9.     Corrine
Irish 1 hour - $920 
10.  Marvelle
Moore (paralegal) 19.3 hours - $7,527, at $390 per hour
11.  Allyson
Lumpkin 6.1 hours - $5,154.5, at $845 per hour
 
Based
on the above, Plaintiff highlights that Defense counsel seeks almost 200 hours
for the anti-SLAPP motion (the actual amount is 163.3 hours in lawyer time plus
19.3 hours in paralegal time) plus $12,930 (without a breakdown among the three
lawyers) on the motion for attorney’s fees. The Court agrees that such a large
number of hours and such a large number of lawyers should not have been
required for this type of motion, regardless of the defendant’s celebrity status.  Adjustments should be made.              
 
In
their reply brief, Defendant argues that simply because multiple partners were
involved in a case, or on the specific anti-SLAPP motion, it does not mean that
the time spent was duplicative.  The
Court agrees with that general proposition, but having spent over 30 years in private
civil practice before being appointed to the Bench, including work with teams
of other lawyers working on high-profile litigation, the Court has considerable
foundation for assessing the reasonableness of time spent, case management, and
the hourly rates charged for the defense of lawsuits.  Also, as a lawyer, Judge Frank prepared and
argued several anti-SLAPP motions.  Defense
counsel notes that Defendant’s former counsel spent 84.4 hours researching the
ability to bring an anti-SLAPP motion on a mixed-conduct claim, and that the
Squire attorneys spent 98.2 hours critically evaluating the motion former
counsel prepared, as well as addressing the argument and authorities in
Plaintiff’s opposition, then researching and drafting the reply brief, and
preparing for and attending the hearing.  Of course they did.  But while anti-SLAPP motions have complexity,
the public figure and publication elements of the moving papers and opposing papers
were not exceptionally complex nor did they require the enormous number of hours
charged by two law firms.  The statute of
limitations argument was also not very complex. 
But invariably there is duplication of effort when a client changes
counsel during the pendency of a motion or of a case, and the Court will
address that aspect of overlapping effort below.
 
In
assessing fee motions across a wide range of disciplines and causes of action, trial
courts are required to consider the novelty, complexity, and difficulty of issues
raised, the skill demonstrating by the moving party, whether the nature of the
litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, and whether the fees were
on a contingency contract or would be paid by the client regardless of the outcome.
 (Ketchum v. Moses, supra, 24
Cal.4th at p. 1132.)  In another context where fee motions are frequently
litigated, the Second District recently upheld a trial court’s proper exercise
of discretion in reducing a fee request because it was unreasonable to have so
many lawyers staffing a case, and/or finding that the hourly rates were
unreasonably high, or that the case “did not present complex or unique issues,
did not involve discovery motions, and did not go to trial.”  (Morris
v. Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 37.)  Here, this Court makes a similar finding.  To have 8 lawyers each charging over $5,000,
and to have 4 of those 8 charging over $15,000 each for their work on the
anti-SLAPP motion alone, is disturbingly high. The motion was directed at part
of a single cause of action that arguably could have been the subject of a
demurrer or motion for summary adjudication rather than an anti-SLAPP
motion.  The Court need not and does not find
that any of these lawyers lied about performing the work or taking that many
hours; rather, the Court exercises its discretion and applies its own 33 years
of experiences as a civil litigation attorney (including over a decade in law
firm management where hourly rates were discussed, decided, and adjusted) and
nearly 9 years as a judge to make determinations of reasonableness.  
 
 
Hourly
Compensations Claimed by Defendant
 
In
making a lodestar calculation of proper hourly rates to apply, “the court may
rely on its own knowledge and familiarity with the legal market, as well as the
experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting fees.  (Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013)
215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1009.)   The Court
may also take into account the difficulty or complexity of the litigation to
which that skill was applied.   (Syers Properties [III, Inc. v. Rankin (2014)
226 Cal.App.4th 691, 700.)  The Court has
done so here.  The Court has ruled on a
multitude of fee motions over the last several years and has read declarations
of dozens of lawyers addressing their hourly rates and the rates charged and
approved in other pending cases.  
 
Plaintiff
argues that the hourly compensation rates claimed by Defendant’s 11 lawyers
staffing this case are unreasonable. Plaintiff is apparently willing to concede
that for the KHIKS attorneys, Defense counsel demonstrated the reasonableness
of the hourly rates, but disputes the higher hourly rates charged by the Squire
attorneys. For example, the hourly rates for the three KHIKS partners who
worked on the anti-SLAPP motion range from $650 to $850. However, the rates for
the Squire partners range up to $1,550/hour, purportedly without sufficient
evidence to support these rates. The Court agrees that Defendant’s moving
papers do not provide enough explanation for charging at such high hourly
rates, nor does the Court feel inclined to award such rates in a case or a
motion such as this one.  The Court
acknowledges that appellate courts have affirmed fee awards for individual
lawyers of over $1,000 an hour.  This Court
has previously awarded $950 an hour for a lawyer with a highly specialized area
of practice who achieved a successful result and demonstrated exceptional skill
on a complicated matter.  Libel and
slander defense is a specialized area of practice with considerable stakes at
risk, but making and winning anti-SLAPP motions has become much less unique in the
last decade or more.    
 
The
Court accordingly adjusts downward the anti-SLAPP motion hours by 25% as to the
lawyers who charged more than 1 hour of time, and adjusts downward the hourly
rates of the 3 lawyers who charged more than $1,000 an hour to a level $1,000 as
noted below, after considering the totality of the circumstances presented on this
fee motion submitted for the Court’s determinations of reasonableness.  The adjusted hours and rates awarded by the Court
are as follows: 
 
1.     Katherine
Kleindienst: 58.8 hours adjust to 44.1 hours at $650/hour =   $28,665
2.     Alan
Kossoff: 25.1 hours adjust to 18.825 hours at $700/hour =  $13,177.50 
3.     Shawn
Holley: .5 hours = $425 
4.     Katharine
Liao 1 hour for $1,222.5, adjusted to $1,000/hr = $1,000 
5.     Carmen
Cole 24 hours adjusted to 18 hours, at $855 per hour = $15,390 
6.     David
Long-Daniels 22.6 hours, adjusted to 16.95, at adjusted $1,000/hr = $16,950
7.     Adam
Fox 7.4 hours - $11,470, adjust to 5.55 hours, at adjusted $1,000/ hour =
$5,550
8.     Hannnah
Makinde 16.8 hours, adjust to 12.6 hours, at $720 per hour = $9,072 
9.     Corrine
Irish 1 hour = $920 
10.  Marvelle
Moore (paralegal) 19.3 hours = $7,527, at $390 per hour
11.  Allyson
Lumpkin 6.1 hours adjust to 4.575 hours, at $845 per hour = $3,865.88
 
The sum of these adjusted
amounts for the anti-SLAPP motion is $102,542.38, which results in an
approximately $40,000 reduction in the amount claimed for the anti-SLAPP motion.  This figure is one the Court finds to be
reasonable in amount and reasonably incurred for that motion.    Assuming
that Mr. Long-Daniels worked the same 35.6% percentage of the total time on the
fee motion as he did on the anti-SLAPP motion, the Court applies the same adjustment
to his hourly rate for that implicit number of hours and reduces the $12,930
amount claimed for the Fee Motion to $11,430. 
The adjusted anti-SLAPP fees plus the adjusted Fee Motion fees equals
$113,972.38.  That is the Court’s tentative
total award on this motion.   
 
 
 
III. CONCLUSION¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
For the foregoing reasons,
Defendant’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees is GRANTED in part. However, the Court
will be lowering the amount of fees awarded, to $113,972.38.  Unless waived, Defendant is ordered to give notice.
