Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge also grants AAA's request for sanctions in the amount of $510. The judge finds that Plaintiff did not respond to AAA's discovery requests, including requests for admission, and therefore deems the truth of the matters specified in those requests admitted. The judge also imposes sanctions on Plaintiff Amnon Mizrahi and his counsel, requiring them to pay $510 to AAA within 30 days of notice.
