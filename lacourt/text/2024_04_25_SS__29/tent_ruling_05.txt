 Case Number:  23STCV23139    Hearing Date:   April 25, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant’s motion for an
order deeming the truth of the matters specified in Requests for Admission (Set
One) admitted by Plaintiff Amnon Mizrahi
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
This case arises out of an accident that
occurred on November 10, 2021.  According to the Complaint,
Plaintiffs Amnon Mizrahi and Susan Mizrahi (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) were
injured when they were struck by their improperly secured vehicle after it
rolled off a flat bed tow truck.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 10-23.)
On September 25, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the
Complaint in this action against Carmel Towing & Transport, Inc.; Bert’s
Garage, Inc.; Automobile Club of Southern California (“AAA”), and Does 1
through 25.  Plaintiffs assert causes of actions for premises
liability; negligence; vicarious liability; and loss of consortium.  
AAA filed its Answer to the Complaint on October
17, 2023.
On
November 30, 2023, AAA served discovery, including Requests for Admission, Set
One to Plaintiff Amnon Mizrahi. (Harwood Decl., ¶ 3 & Exh. A.) Plaintiff
did not respond to this discovery request. (Id., ¶ 5.) 
On March 4, 2024, AAA filed this motion for an
order deeming admitted as true the matters specified in the Requests for
Admission.  AAA also seeks sanctions.
Plaintiff has not filed any
opposition.
Legal Standard
A
party must respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for
admission are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding party
“may move for an order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)
There is no time limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are
required. (See id., § 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.
v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must
a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).)
The
court “shall” make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the
request be deemed admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the
requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the
motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in
substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super.
Ct. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to
deem admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision
(d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to
respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)  
“The court may award sanctions
under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel
discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to
the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving
party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).) 
Discussion
Defendant
AAA served Plaintiff Amnon Mizrahi with Requests for Admission (Set One) on
November 30, 2023. (Harwood Decl., ¶ 3 & Exh. A.) Plaintiff did not respond.
(Id., ¶ 5.) 
 
AAA need
not show anything more. The motion for an order deeming the truth of the
matters specified in Requests for Admissions (Set One) admitted by Plaintiff
Amnon Mizrahi is GRANTED. 
 
AAA’s request for sanctions is granted under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c).  Given the relatively straightforward nature
of this motion, the Court sets sanctions in the amount of $510, based on two
hours of attorney time, multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $225
per hour, plus a $60 filing fee.  (Harwood
Decl., ¶ 2.) 
Conclusion 
The Court GRANTS AAA’s motion for a
deemed-admitted order.
The Court ORDERS that the truth of the
matters specified in AAA’s Requests for Admission (Set One) are deemed admitted
by Plaintiff
Amnon Mizrahi.
The
Court GRANTS in part AAA’s request for sanctions.
The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff Amnon Mizrahi and counsel of record George K. Jawlakian,
jointly and severally, to pay monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act
in the amount of $510 to Defendant AAA within 30 days of notice. 
Moving party is
ORDERED to give notice.
