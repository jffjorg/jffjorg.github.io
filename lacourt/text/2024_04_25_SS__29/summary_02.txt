The judge grants the defendant's motion to continue the trial, setting the new trial date to October 4, 2024. The defendant, Julia McDonough, had requested the continuance due to the delay in obtaining necessary discovery. The court finds that the defendant has met her burden of showing good cause for the continuance, citing the recent responses to discovery requests and the need for further information via subpoena. The final status conference and all deadlines are reset based on the new trial date.
