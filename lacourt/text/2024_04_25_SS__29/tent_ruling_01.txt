  Case Number:  20STCV14261    Hearing Date:   April 25, 2024    Dept:  29 Petition for Approval
of Minor’s Compromise as to Charlie Payton (Age 13)
 
Tentative: 
 
The Court excuses the appearance of
Petitioner and the Minor Claimant.
 
Petitioner filed her Petition for
Approval of Minor’s Compromise on December 21, 2023. 
 
On January 5, 2024, the Court
identified certain small issues that needed to be addressed before the Court could
grant the petition.
 
Petitioner filed a new Petition for
Approval of Minor’s Compromise on January 10, 2024.
 
On February 7, 2024, the Court noted
that some of the issues that had been identified on January 5 had been
addressed but some had not been. 
Specifically, the Court stated:
“1.        Medical Expenses: There are still issues
regarding the information in Item No. 12.  Dr. Hamzah appears to have
charged $6,725 and agreed to accept $4,000 as payment in full.  That
is not a reduction of $4,000.  (Item 12b(5)(b)(E).)  It
appears to be a reduction of $2,725, but it may be less, if he has been paid in
part by Medi-Cal.  In any event, it is unclear, and the math in Item
12b(5)(b) is incorrect. 

Item 12a(4) also appears to be incorrect.  According to Item 16(b),
$4,212.42 from the gross settlement amount will be used to pay medical expenses
(presumably that is the sum of $4,000 to Dr. Hamzah and $212.42 for the
Medi-Cal lien).  But Item 12a(4) states that the amount of medical
expenses to be paid or reimbursed from the proceeds is $0.

The Court cannot approve the Petition until these items are corrected.
2.                 
Filed Order: The Court’s order of January 5 identified two issues
with the proposed order (MC-351).  First, Item No. 1 of the order is
blank.  Second, there were math issues in the proposed
order.  No new order has been submitted. 
 
Petitioner must submit a new order that includes
the information for Item No. 1; that identifies the gross amount or value of
the settlement in Item No. 6; that in Item No. 8(b) identifies all fees and
expenses to be paid from the gross settlement amount prior to distribution of
the net amount to the claimant.

The Court cannot approve the Petition until these items are corrected.”
Petitioner submitted a new Petition to Approve
Minor’s Compromise and a new Proposed Order on April 4 and 8, 2024.  These documents have not addressed the
previously identified defects.
To give further guidance to Petitioner and
counsel, the Court provides the following further details.
Petition
For ease of reference, the Court begins with Item
12b(5)(b)(i), at the top of page 5 of the Petition.  The Petition states that Mr. Hamza has
charged $6,725, agreed to a negotiated reduction of $4,000, and will be paid
$4,000.  That math is incorrect.  If the balance that is owed to Dr. Hamza
(after the negotiated reduction) is $4,000, then the amount of the reduction is
$2,725.  ($6,725 minus $2,725 equals
$4,000.)
If that is correct, and Dr. Hamza has agreed to
a reduction of $2,725, leaving a balance that will be paid to him of $4,000
from the settlement proceeds, then the following changes must be made to the Petition:
1.     
Item 12a(3).  The correct
number for this line is $2,725.
 
2.     
Item 12b(5)(b)(i)(E).  The
correct number for this line is $2,725.
Proposed Order
The proposed order submitted on April 4, 2024,
is missing some information.  
1.     
First, according to the Petition (Items 13b and 16d), counsel is
to be reimbursed $5,149.03 from the settlement proceeds for expenses.  That reimbursement must be identified in Item
8a(2) of the proposed order.
 
2.     
Second, the Medi-Cal lien of $212.42 must be identified in Item 8a(4)
of the proposed order.
The hearing on the petition is continued for
approximately 21 days so that these issues may be addressed.
Moving party to give notice.
