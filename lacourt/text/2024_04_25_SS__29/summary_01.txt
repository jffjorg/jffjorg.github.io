And here is the English text to summarize this judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case, excusing the appearance of the petitioner and the minor claimant. The court has identified several issues that need to be addressed before it can grant the petition for approval of the minor's compromise. Specifically, the court has noted that the information in item 12b(5)(b) is incorrect, and that the proposed order is missing some information. The court has directed the petitioner to submit a new order that includes the necessary information and corrects the math errors. The court has also indicated that the proposed order must identify all fees and expenses to be paid from the gross settlement amount. The hearing on the petition has been continued for approximately 21 days to allow the petitioner to address these issues.
