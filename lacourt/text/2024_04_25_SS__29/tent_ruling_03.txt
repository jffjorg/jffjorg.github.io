 Case Number:  21STCV24597    Hearing Date:   April 25, 2024    Dept:  29 Tentative
The two motions to compel further discovery responses that
are on calendar for April 25 were initially set for hearing on January 26.  The Court continued the hearing so that the
parties could participate in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC), as
required by the Standing Order.
An IDC was scheduled for April 10.  Moving party (Plaintiff) did not appear.  Accordingly, the IDC was placed off calendar.
In light of moving party’s failure to attend the IDC, the
Court places these two motions off calendar.
Moving party to give notice.
