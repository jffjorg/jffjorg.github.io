 Case Number:  22STCV06001    Hearing Date:   April 25, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s Counsel Jacob Brown of Downtown Law
Group. 
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On February 16, 2022, Lamar Reaves (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Gwendolyn Achury and Does 1 to 20 for motor vehicle
negligence and general negligence causes of action arising from an automobile
accident occurring on October 6, 2020.
On April 16, 2024, Jacob
Brown of Downtown Law Group (“Counsel”) filed this motion to be relieved
as counsel. No opposition has been filed. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration and Order to be Relieved as Counsel. Service has
been made on all parties in this action. Counsel contends there has been a
breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. Counsel was unable to confirm Plaintiff’s
address, but conducted a TLO search and sent the moving papers with return
receipt requested.
 
The Court finds
that Counsel has met the procedural requirements to be relieved and has
established good cause based on the breakdown of the attorney-client
relationship.
 
Accordingly, the
motion is GRANTED.
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is GRANTED.
The order is
effective upon the filing of a proof of service showing service of the signed
order (not merely the minute order) on the client.
Moving counsel
to give notice.
