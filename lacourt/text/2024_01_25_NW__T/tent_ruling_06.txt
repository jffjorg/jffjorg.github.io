 Case Number:  23VECV05023    Hearing Date:   January 25, 2024    Dept:  T ARTEAGA V SANCHEZ 23VECV05023
[TENTATIVE] ORDER: 
Defendants Enrique Navarro Sanchez and Laura Olivia Humbert Flores’s
Unopposed Demurrer to the Complaint is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.  
Introduction 
Defendants Enrique Navarro Sanchez and Laura Olivia Humbert
Flores (Defendants) demurred to Plaintiff Humbertino Arteaga’s (Plaintiff)
unlawful detainer Complaint.  Plaintiff
did not file an opposition or ask for leave to amend.
Discussion  
Defendants argued that the three-day notice (Notice)
attached to the complaint is invalid because it did not strictly comply with
the statutory requirements.  (Code Civ.
Proc., sec. 1161(2).)  The alleged
monthly rent of $7,600.00 identified in the Notice is allegedly
overstated.  (Compl. Exh. 2.)  Defendants cited to Plaintiff’s allegation in
the body of the Complaint alleging that the monthly rent was only
$3,800.00.  (Compl. par. 6.a.(2).)  When the Notice does not accurately state the
amount owed in rent, the Notice will not support an unlawful detainer
action.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec.
1161(2).)  (Levitz Furniture Co. v.
Wingtip Communications, Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1035, 1038.)  However, the Court noted that Plaintiff also
expressly alleged that the amount of rent owed at the time of serving the
Notice was $30,400.00, which is the same amount identified on the Notice.  (Compl. par. 12.)  Because of the conflicting allegations as to
the actual monthly rent to be paid, the Complaint is seen to be uncertain.  No opposition was filed and no argument given
as to how the problem can be cured. 
There was no request for leave to amend. 
The demurrer is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.  
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
