And here is the English summary:

This tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the Complaint without leave to amend. The defendants argued that the three-day notice attached to the complaint is invalid because it does not strictly comply with statutory requirements, specifically the alleged monthly rent of $7,600.00 is overstated. The plaintiff did not file an opposition or ask for leave to amend, and the Court noted that the Complaint has conflicting allegations regarding the actual monthly rent to be paid. As a result, the Complaint is deemed uncertain and the demurrer is sustained.
