 Case Number:  22VECV00532    Hearing Date:   January 25, 2024    Dept:  T 22VECV00532 Charthern v Block
[TENTATIVE] ORDER: 
Defendant Tom Block’s Unopposed Motion for Attorneys’ Fees is GRANTED.
Introduction 
Defendant Tom Block (Defendant), as the prevailing party,
moved for attorneys’ fees against Plaintiffs Charles Charthern and Charlene
Charthern (collectively, Plaintiffs). 
Defendant requested a total of $23,652.50.  Plaintiffs did not file an opposition to the
motion.  
Discussion  
Defendant asserted an entitlement to attorneys’ fees based
upon the fees provision within the Note and Deed of Trust at issue in the
action.  The Court is authorized to award
attorneys’ fees under a contract or statute. 
Because Defendant provided that the contract at issue included an
attorneys’ fees provision, Defendant sufficiently provided good cause for
attorneys’ fees.  Defendant’s Counsels
provided their declarations to support the reasonableness of the fees
requested.  Attorney Bruce Lorman
provided that Defendant incurred 29.45 hours in fees at $450.00/hr. (totaling
$13,252.50).  (Lorman Decl. pars. 11,
14-15.)  Attorney Paul Kelley provided
that Defendant incurred 53.20 hours at the rate of $400 (totaling
$10,400.00).  (Kelley Decl. pars.
5-6.)  Based upon the declarations of
both Attorneys, the Court finds the hours incurred and the rate charged to be
reasonable.  Plaintiff did not oppose the
motion and did not present a dispute against the relief requested.
The motion for attorneys’ fees is GRANTED.  
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
