And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted in part the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production (RFPs). The defendant's responses to RFPs were not Code compliant, using boilerplate language and failing to provide specific statutory language and privilege logs. As a result, the court finds that the defendant committed discovery abuse. The judge has awarded monetary sanctions to the plaintiff in the amount of $2,500, payable by February 23, 2024. The judge has also ordered the defendant to provide Code compliant responses to all requests in which the court uses the word GRANT within 20 days. Additionally, the court has stricken the defendant's preliminary response to its responses because there is no statutory authority allowing it.
