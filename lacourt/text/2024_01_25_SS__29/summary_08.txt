And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants in part and denies in part the plaintiff's motion to quash the subpoena issued by the defendant. The plaintiff, Sara Azoulay, is seeking to quash the subpoena that requires her to produce employment and medical records related to the slip and fall accident she was involved in on August 2, 2021. The defendant, Essex Property Trust, Inc., is seeking to obtain these records to support its defense.

The court finds that the defendant has made an adequate showing of a legitimate and countervailing interest as to categories 1 and 3 of the subpoena, which relate to the plaintiff's health and work absences. However, the court denies the defendant's request for categories 2, 4, 5, and 6, which seek information that is not directly relevant to the claims or defenses in dispute.

The court modifies the subpoena to limit the time period to August 2, 2016 to the present, and strikes categories 2, 4, 5, and 6. The court balances the competing interests of the plaintiff's privacy rights and the defendant's legitimate need for information and finds that the defendant's interest in obtaining the records outweighs the plaintiff's privacy interest.

The court concludes that the plaintiff's motion to quash is granted in part and denied in part, and that the subpoena is modified to reflect the court's findings.
