And here is the English summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel filed by the defendants (Advance Auto Parts, Inc., WORLDPAC, Inc., Wheels, Inc., and Onorio Perez) against the plaintiff (Melinda Rosenthal). The defendants served the plaintiff with discovery requests, including requests for production of documents, form interrogatories, and special interrogatories, in May 2022. The plaintiff responded with objection-only responses, which the defendants contend were untimely and insufficient. The defendants filed a motion to compel initial responses to the discovery requests, but the plaintiff did not file an opposition. On the eve of the hearing, the plaintiff filed an objection stating that she had provided substantive responses earlier that day, rendering the motion moot. The judge has taken the motion off calendar, finding that the plaintiff's untimely responses do not divest the court of its authority to hear the motion. The judge also declines to award monetary sanctions to the defendants, as they failed to properly file a motion to compel further responses and schedule an informal discovery conference prior to the hearing.
