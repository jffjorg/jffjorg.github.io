Restaurants, Inc. and Universal Studios LLC dba Universal Citywalk Hollywood. The Plaintiff alleges injuries on August 7, 2021, on premises owned, operated, controlled, managed, or maintained by the Defendants and asserts causes of action for premises liability and general negligence. The Defendants filed an answer, and the Plaintiff filed motions to compel further responses to discovery requests. The hearings on the motions were previously continued due to lack of compliance with the Standing Order, and the Court now intends to continue the hearings on January 25, 2024. The Court is unclear about the Plaintiff's intentions regarding the motions and urges the parties to comply with the Standing Order, particularly the requirement to conduct an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC).
