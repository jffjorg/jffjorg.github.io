Background
October 10, 2023, Levi Ray Schryvers and
Joshua Cothran
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against
Defendant Felix Miguel Avita and Does 1 through 10 for the causes of action
General Negligence and Motor Vehicle Negligence. 
On December 27, 2023, Vicent D. Howard (“Counsel”) filed a motion to be
relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Joshua Cothran (“Plaintiff”). No opposition
has been filed. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or substituted
at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon request by
either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other. (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where conflicts
between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
Counsel has
filed the Notice of Motion and Motion and Declaration to be Relieved as Counsel.  The moving papers establish a basis for the
requested relief.
All procedural
requirements have not been satisfied, however, as no Order (on Form MC-053) has
been submitted, as required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).
Accordingly, the
motion is CONTINUED so that Counsel submit the required order.
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is CONTINUED.
Moving counsel
to give notice.
