And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Hertz Global Holdings, Inc.'s motion to continue trial or to advance its motion for summary judgment. The motion was filed on December 21, 2023, and the trial is currently scheduled for March 29, 2024. The judge finds good cause to continue the trial due to the Court's availability and the fact that the Defendant was unable to schedule the motion for summary judgment for a hearing date at least 30 days prior to trial. The judge also considers the proximity of the trial date, the length of the continuance requested, and the availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion. The judge concludes that the interests of justice are best served by a continuance, and trial is continued to a date in or after mid-March 2025.
