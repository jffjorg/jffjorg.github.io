English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants Caliber Paving Company's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Vons, and also grants Caliber's motion to continue the trial date. The cross-complaint alleges causes of action for declaratory relief, equitable indemnity, and express indemnity, and arises out of the same "transaction" or "occurrence" as the causes of action alleged by Vons in its cross-complaint. The Court finds that Caliber has made an adequate showing of good cause for its requested continuance, and that a continuance will allow for the orderly resolution of the various claims and defenses of the parties. The Court orders Caliber to file its cross-complaint within 14 days, and continues the trial date to mid-June 2024.
