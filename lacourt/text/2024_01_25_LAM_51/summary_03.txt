Summary:

The Judge, Upinder S. Kalra, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for trial preference filed by Plaintiffs Luna Ruiz-Esquivel, et al. The Plaintiffs are seeking a preferential trial date due to Plaintiff Luna's age (under 14 years old) and the alleged medical negligence that caused her injuries. The Judge grants the motion for trial preference, citing California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 36(b), which provides for preference in cases involving wrongful death or personal injury when the party is under 14 years old. The Judge sets a new trial date no later than October 21, 2024, and resets all trial-related cutoffs and deadlines to correspond with the new trial date.
