And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion for attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses in the amount of $28,637.50 in attorneys' fees and $2,827.85 in costs. The prevailing party has the burden of showing that the requested attorney fees are reasonable. The court finds that the hours billed by the plaintiffs' counsel are reasonable. However, the court declines to apply the requested 0.5 lodestar enhancement because the case was relatively straightforward and did not present any novel or complex issues.

The court also reduces the requested amount of costs and expenses by $600 because the cost of court reporter fees for a future hearing has yet to be incurred. The court grants the motion as follows:

* $28,637.50 in attorneys' fees
* $2,827.85 in costs

The moving party is to give notice.
