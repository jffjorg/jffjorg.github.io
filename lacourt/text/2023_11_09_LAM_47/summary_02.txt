  - "A review of the moving papers reveals, however, that Plaintiff did not serve notice of this motion on nonparty T-Mobile/Metro PCS. California Rules of Court Rule 3.1346 requires service of a motion to compel production of documents on the nonparty by personal service or if the nonparty agrees, by mail or electronic service."
```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is that Plaintiff Angelica Munoz Cabanillas is ordered to serve nonparty T-Mobile/Metro PCS with the instant Motion for Court Order Compelling Production of Phone Records and file proof of service with the Court. The hearing scheduled for November 9, 2023 is continued to December 11, 2023 at 9:00 a.m. The Court finds that Plaintiff did not serve notice of this motion on nonparty T-Mobile/Metro PCS, which is required by California Rules of Court Rule 3.1346. The Court also notes that T-Mobile/Metro PCS, as a public utility, cannot provide the phone records that are subject of the subpoena if the telephone number is associated with a prepaid account, even with the account holder's consent. Therefore, a Court order is necessary to compel production of the records.
