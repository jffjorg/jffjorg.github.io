Motion
for Court Order Compelling Production of T-Mobile/Metro PCS Phone Records



 
MOVING PARTY:                           Plaintiff Angelica Munoz Cabanillas 
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S):            Defendant
Quickbites Inc.
 
 
STATEMENT OF
MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
On December 12, 2022, Angelica Munoz Cabanillas
(“Plaintiff”) filed a 13-cause-of-action Complaint against Quickbites, Inc.
(“Defendant”) after she was allegedly terminated after contracting COVID-19.
Plaintiff was hired by Defendant in 2021 and worked as a cook in one of
Defendant’s Del Taco locations (Complaint, ¶ 10.) On December 7, 2021 after
experiencing symptoms, plaintiff visited a local clinic where she learned she
tested positive for COVID-19. (Complaint, ¶ 12.) At first Plaintiff was placed
off of work until December 14, 2021. (Id.) However, after follow-ups
with her doctor, her doctor determined that Plaintiff could not return to work
until February 8, of 2022. (Complaint, ¶ 16.) Plaintiff kept her assistant
manager up to date but alleges that she was terminated due to her illness.
(Complaint, ¶ 17.)
The instant Motion for a Court Order Compelling Production
of Phone Records (“Motion”) was filed on October 9, 2023 and is unopposed.  
 
TENTATIVE
RULING:
 
            Plaintiff
is ordered to serve nonparty T-Mobile/Metro PCS with the instant Motion and
file proof of service with the Court. On the Court’s own motion, the hearing
scheduled for November 9, 2023 is continued to December 11, 2023 at 9:00 a.m.   
 
 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Legal Standard & Analysis
 
            The
governing rule here is CCP § 1985.3(f): “A subpoena duces tecum for personal
records maintained by a telephone corporation which is a public utility, as
defined in Section 216 of the Public Utilities Code, shall not be valid or
effective unless it includes a consent to release, signed by the consumer whose
records are requested, as required by Section 2891 of the Public Utilities
Code.” 
 
            The public
utility company here, T-Mobile/Metro PCS is unable to provide the phone records
that are subject of the subpoena if the telephone number is associated with a
prepaid account as here, even with the account holder’s consent. (See
Declaration Jacob Nalbandyan ISO Motion for Court Order Compelling Production
of T-Mobile/Metro PCS Phone Records, Exh. F) Therefore, a Court order is
necessary. A review of the moving papers reveals, however, that Plaintiff did
not serve notice of this motion on nonparty T-Mobile/Metro PCS. California
Rules of Court Rule 3.1346 requires service of a motion to compel production of
documents on the nonparty by personal service or if the nonparty agrees, by
mail or electronic service. Therefore, the moving party here will be required
to serve the nonparty with the instant Motion, and then file proof of service
with this Court.  
            
CONCLUSION
 
            For the
reasons explained above, Plaintiff is ordered to serve nonparty T-Mobile/Metro
PCS with the instant Motion and file proof of service with the Court.  On the Court’s own motion, the hearing
scheduled for November 9, 2023 is continued to December 11, 2023 at 9:00
a.m.   
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

parties must be copied on the email.  It should be noted that if you

party appears. By submitting on the tentative you have, in essence, waived your
right to be present at the hearing, and you should be aware that the court may
not adopt the tentative, and may issue an order which modifies the tentative
ruling in whole or in part.
