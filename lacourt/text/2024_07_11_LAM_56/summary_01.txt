Event: Motion to Compel Further Responses and for Sanctions
Money: $12,290 (Plaintiffs' request), $3,100 (imposed sanctions)
Intentions: Centaurus' responses to Plaintiffs' requests for production are inadequate and not Code-compliant, and Centaurus must provide a full, verified, Code-compliant response to each request.
Facts: Centaurus has failed to provide complete due diligence files as requested, and its responses to certain requests consist of "N/A" without indicating whether the requested documents do not exist or whether Centaurus is objecting to the requests. Centaurus has also failed to provide sufficient factual information for other parties to evaluate the merits of its claims of privilege.
Disputes: Centaurus claims that its responses are Code-compliant and that it has properly objected to certain requests based on attorney-client privilege and attorney work-product doctrine.
Acts: Centaurus has served unverified, "objection-only" responses to Plaintiffs' requests for production, and has failed to provide a full, verified, Code-compliant response to each request.

Significant Statements:
* Centaurus' responses are not Code-compliant and must be supplemented with a full, verified, Code-compliant response to each request.
* Centaurus must serve a privilege log on Plaintiffs, and the privilege log must be sufficiently specific to allow a determination as to whether a withheld document is, in fact, privileged.
* The Court exercises its discretion and imposes monetary sanctions against Centaurus and its counsel, jointly and severally, in the reasonable amount of $3,100.
