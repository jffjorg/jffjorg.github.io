Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a cross-complaint filed by Revel Management Group, LLC against Hugo Villasenor, Alexandra Del Salto, and The Muse Agency, LLC. The cross-complaint arose out of a business relationship between the parties. Revel had filed a demurrer to Villasenor's answer to the cross-complaint and to Del Salto and Muse's answer to the cross-complaint. However, the cross-defendants have since filed their First Amended Answer to the cross-complaint, which supersedes their original answers and moots Revel's demurrers. As a result, the demurrers are taken off the calendar. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court as directed by the instructions provided on the court website.
