RESPONDING PARTY: None
 
            This action arises out of a business
relationship.  On June 6, 2022, Plaintiff
Hugo Villasenor (“Villasenor) filed a complaint against Defendants Roberto
Banuelos Jr. (“Banuelos”) and Revel (collectively, “Defendants”).  Villasenor filed the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”)
against Defendants on September 16, 2022. 

 
            On August 14, 2023, Defendants filed
a Motion for Summary Judgment (“MSJ”) with regard to the FAC, which was granted
by the Court in its entirety in an Order dated June 14, 2024.
 
            On February 15, 2024, Revel filed a
cross-complaint (“Cross-Complaint”) against Villasenor; Alexandra Del Salto
(“Del Salto”); and The Muse Agency, LLC (“Muse”) (collectively,
“Cross-Defendants”).  Villasenor filed an
answer to the Cross-Complaint on March 18, 2024, while Del Salto and Muse filed
their answer to the Cross-Complaint on April 10, 2024.
 
            Revel filed a Demurrer to Villasenor’s
answer to the Cross-Complaint on March 28, 2024, and a Demurrer to Del Salto
and Muse’s answer to the Cross-Complaint on April 17, 2024.
 
On June 27, 2024, Cross-Defendants jointly filed
their First Amended Answer to the Cross-Complaint.
 
Code Civ. Proc., § 472(a) states that “[a] party may
amend its pleading once without leave of the court . . . after a demurrer or
motion to strike is filed but before the demurrer or motion to strike is heard
if the amended pleading is filed and served no later than the date for filing
an opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike.”
 
Cross-Defendants’ amended answer superseded their
respective original answers and mooted Revel’s demurrers. (JKC3H8 v. Colton
(2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 468, 477 [“ ‘ “an amendatory pleading supersedes the
original one, which ceases to perform any function as a pleading” ’ ” (citing Foreman
& Clark Corp. v. Fallon (1971) 3 Cal.3d 875, 884), and renders moot a
motion directed at the original].)
 
             Accordingly, the respective demurrers to
Villasenor’s answer to the Cross-Complaint and to Del Salto and Muse’s answer
to the Cross-Complaint are moot and taken off the calendar.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
Dated this 11th day of July 2024
