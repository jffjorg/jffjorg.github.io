And here is the English-text summary:

The court's tentative ruling is to grant the plaintiff's application to advance the hearing date and order his deposition to take place within 10 days. However, the court is inclined to deny the applications of SSK and Kelishadi, MD because the motions were untimely. The court is also inclined to deny the motion to compel the deposition of the PMQ of Century, as the plaintiff's counsel cancelled the deposition and failed to depose the PMQ. The court notes that the plaintiff's counsel omitted crucial facts from their declaration and failed to depose the PMQ, which may result in the PMQ not being allowed to testify at trial.
