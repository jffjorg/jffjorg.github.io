  Case Number:  22VECV01728    Hearing Date:   May 30, 2024    Dept:  T 22VECV01728 Elbatsh v Domanski
Tentative ruling: Motion to advance hearing dates on motions to compel depositions or alternative motion to continue trial: Grant in part and deny in part.
The court is inclined to grant the application as to the plaintiff, advance it to May 30th, and order his deposition to take place within 10 days.  It should be made clear to plaintiff’s counsel that the deposition of the plaintiff WILL TAKE PLACE before trial.
The court is inclined to deny the applications as to SSK and Kelishadi, MD because the motions were untimely even if there had been time to hear them before trial.  16 court days’ notice plus 2 days for electronic service was required.  No leave of court was granted for shortening time on the motion.  The motions were served on less than 16 days’ notice for a hearing 15 days before trial meaning it was untimely even if the motions could have been heard 15 days before trial.
The tentative ruling on the motion to compel the PMQ of Century will be to deny as Meshel Ozulay made himself available for deposition on the date selected by plaintiff on October 30, 2023 and plaintiff failed to take it.  In the ex parte application to advance the hearing on this motion, plaintiff states “Defendants are contesting liability in this matter which makes Defendant’s Persons Most Knowledgeable (“PMK”) deposition a critical component of discovery in this matter.”  The moving papers state that “Plaintiffs have been precluded from deposing Century’s PMK...” which is untrue.  It should be clear that if Mr. Ozulay does not give his deposition, he may not testify at trial.  Plaintiff’s counsel omitted the fact that the deposition of the PMQ was noticed for October 30, 2023, Mr. Ozulay agreed to appear, and then plaintiff’s counsel CANCELLED THE DEPOSITION.  It is a material misrepresentation for Alik Ekmekchyan to omit these facts from his declaration and does not attach the 10/25/2023 at 9:44 a.m. email from plaintiff’s counsel asking to confirm the depo of the Century PMK and the response from defense counsel Taylor McDougall of 10/25/2023 9:48 a.m. confirming the deposition of Century PMQ for October 30th.  On 10/26/2023 at 7:07 p.m., Mr. Ekmekchyan, without explanation, withdrew the Century PMQ notice.
