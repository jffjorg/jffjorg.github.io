Otherwise, if it cannot unequivocally state that under oath, then it is ordered to produce these documents.”  The Order to supplement Defendant’s responses pertained to seven Engineering Work Orders (EWO): ((1) HTJMPT, (2) IITJMPU, (3) JJGJM, (4) JMN.JH, (5) HYPSZ, (6) I-IYPSZA, and (7) KYKKSC; 40 safety investigations (i.e., RFP 16 and 20); Technical Service Bulletins (TSB): 20-NA-050, 22-NA-176, and PIP5175; ELIROXAN000014636-14640; e-mails or internal investigation documents concerning warranty claim requests for California Cadillacs with transmission problems.  Further, the Court ordered Defendant to produce an Amended Privilege Log, which identifies “the withheld documents with sufficient information such that a challenge can be made to the claim of privilege.”  Plaintiff asserted that Defendant failed to comply with the March 19, 2024 Order.  (Liu Decl. par. 17.)  However, Defendant asserted that no further responses were required after the March 19, 2024 Order because the Order was to the extent certain documents were not produced and Defendant supplemented the discovery responses (i.e., produced all requested documents).  However, Defendant’s opposition and evidence failed to show that any additional and/or withheld documents were produced.  It was determined at the March 19, 2024 hearing that Defendant did not produce responsive documents and the Court ordered Defendant to supplement their response by either producing the requested documents or stating that the documents “are not in the custody, control or possession of GM and, if so. what happened to them (never existed, destroyed, lost. stolen. in some other's possession and identify who.)”  Without any evidence showing that Defendant actually produced the requested documents, inclusive of the amended privilege log, or a supplemental response explaining the reason why the documents cannot be produced, Defendant’s contention is not persuasive. Defendant intentionally violated the Court’s Order as to these RPDs twice.  The Court finds that the violation of the Court’s Orders is willful and Defendant persisted in a pattern of refusal to give meaningful discovery responses.  Defendant’s pattern in refusing to give meaningful discovery responses showed an abuse of the discovery process and causing prejudice to Plaintiff as the trial is set in two weeks.  The Court finds that terminating sanctions are authorized because less severe sanctions would be futile.The motion for terminating sanctions is GRANTED.  Defendant’s Answer is stricken and default is entered.The motion for issue, evidentiary, and monetary sanctions is MOOT. IT IS SO ORDERED, MOVING PARTY IS TO GIVE VERBATIM NOTICE OF THIS RULING.
