And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Roxana Eli, the plaintiff, and General Motors LLC, the defendant. The plaintiff moved for terminating sanctions against the defendant for failing to comply with court orders regarding Requests for Production of Documents (RPD). The defendant had failed to produce responsive documents and had provided incomplete and non-compliant responses. The court had ordered the defendant to supplement its responses, but the defendant failed to comply. The court finds that the defendant's violation of the court's orders was willful and that the defendant persisted in a pattern of refusal to provide meaningful discovery responses. As a result, the court granted the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions, striking the defendant's answer and entering default. The court also ordered the plaintiff to submit a default judgment package.
