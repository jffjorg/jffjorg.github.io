```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is inclined to grant the plaintiff's application to advance the hearing date and order his deposition to take place within 10 days. However, the court will deny the applications of SSK and Kelishadi due to the untimely service of the motions. The court will also deny the motion to compel the PMQ of Century due to the plaintiff's failure to take the deposition when it was originally scheduled. The court notes that the plaintiff's counsel omitted key facts from their declaration, including the cancellation of the original deposition date.
