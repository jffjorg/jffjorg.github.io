And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Honorable Gary Y. Tanaka, has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Waldman Construction, Inc. in the case of Liam Umer, et al. v. Newvac Lift, LLC, et al.

The case involves an elevator accident at 441 23rd Street, Manhattan Beach, CA 90266, in which Liam Umer, a minor, suffered injuries to his left arm and hand. The Defendant argues that the defect in the elevator was patent and not latent, and therefore, they are not liable for the injuries sustained.

However, the Judge finds that the issue of whether the defect was patent or latent presents a triable issue of fact. The Judge also finds that a reasonable homeowner may not have discovered the defect through a reasonable inspection, and therefore, the issue of whether the Defendant was negligent in their maintenance or inspection of the elevator is also a triable issue of fact.

As a result, the Judge denies the motion for summary judgment and allows the case to proceed to trial.
