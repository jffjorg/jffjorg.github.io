PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT OR IN THE
ALTERNATIVE FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION is MOOT because the parties have
settled the matter. 
 
Background
 
This is a credit cards collection case. 
 
On July 6, 2023, Plaintiff AMERICAN EXPRESS NATIONAL BANK
filed suit against Defendant DIANE LAI alleging $30,593.85 in damages. 
 
On August 17, 2023, Defendant filed an answer.
 
On November 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motion. 
 
On December 5, 2023, Plaintiff informed the Court that the
matter has reached a Settlement Agreement. (See Minute Order.)
 
On December 23, 2023, Plaintiff’s Counsel filed a
Declaration Regarding Order to Show Cause Hearing, which indicated that the
parties reached a tentative settlement.
 
On February 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Case Management
Statement, indicating that “The parties have tentatively settled this matter
and defendant is current on settlement payments. A settlement stipulation has
recently been circulated, and if defendant returns the signed stipulation and
complies with its terms, plaintiff intends to dismiss this matter without
prejudice with the court to retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the
settlement per CCP § 664.6. In the event the parties’ tentative settlement
breaks down, plaintiff intends to proceed with its motion for summary
judgment.” 
 
Discussion
 
The instant motion is moot because the parties have reached
a settlement and there is no indication, thus far, that Defendant has defaulted
on the settlement.
