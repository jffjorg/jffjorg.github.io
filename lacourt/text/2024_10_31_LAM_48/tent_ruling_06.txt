  CASE NO.: 24STCV18206
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING PETITION TO APPROVE
  MINOR’S COMPROMISE
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 31, 2024



 
Claimant
Nolan Mernin, a minor, by and through his parent Meghan L. Mernin, has agreed to
settle his claim with Decedent’s uninsured motorist insurer in exchange for $300,000.00.  Of this amount, $4,160.00 is allocated for medical
expenses, $75,000.00 is allocated for attorney fees, and $840.00 is allocated for
costs, leaving a balance of $220,000.00 for Claimant.  If approved, the funds will be invested in a single-premium
deferred annuity, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the court.
Court
approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code
Civ. Proc., § 372.)  The Court has reviewed
the proposed settlement and finds that it is fair and reasonable.  The Court also finds that the attorney fees, which
are 25% of the funds, are fair and reasonable.
Accordingly,
the Amended Petition to Approve Minor’s Compromise is GRANTED.
The
Court sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Proof of Annuity for January 31, 2025 at 8:30
a.m.  If proof of investment in the annuity
is filed before that date, no appearance will be required.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
