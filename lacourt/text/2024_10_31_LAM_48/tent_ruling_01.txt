[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING IN PART PLAINTIFF’S
  MOTION FOR ATTORNEY FEES AND EXPENSES 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 31, 2024



 
Plaintiff
Nicholas Drobnis and Defendant FCA US LLC have reached a settlement in this Song-Beverly
action.  On July 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a motion for attorney fees, along with a memorandum of costs.
As
the prevailing party, Plaintiff is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees
and expenses.  (Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d).)  California courts apply the “lodestar” approach
to determine what fees are reasonable.  (See,
e.g., Holguin v. DISH Network LLC (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1332.)  This inquiry “begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e.,
the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.”  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095.)  From there, the “lodestar figure
may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in
order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided.”  (Ibid.)  Relevant factors include “(1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them,
(3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment
by the attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1132.)  The party seeking fees has the burden
of documenting the appropriate hours expended and hourly rates.  (City of Colton v. Singletary (2012) 206
Cal.App.4th 751, 784.)
Plaintiff
requests $18,042.50 in attorney fees, $2,352.59 in costs and expenses, and $2,000.00
in attorney fees for the reply and hearing on this motion.
Plaintiff
provides a copy of counsel’s billing records. 
(Sarbaz Decl., Ex. F.)  Plaintiff’s
counsel charges various hourly rates: $525 for Aryan Sarbaz; $435, $475, or $500
for Shawn Halbert; $300 for Heidy Garcia; and $200 for paralegal Phillip Dean.  These rates are reasonable for experienced attorneys
in Los Angeles specializing in these types of cases.  But because they are experienced with Song-Beverly
litigation, they should be more efficient in those types of cases than less experienced
attorneys.
Defendant
argues that some clerical tasks (filing, service, and managing files) should be
excluded from billing, and block-billed excessive time should be reduced.  (Opposition at pp. 5-6.)  The Court agrees that a slight reduction is warranted
for these items.
Considering
the type of case, complexity of the case, length of litigation, and the record as
a whole, the Court concludes that a reasonable amount of attorney fees is $18,242.00
($18,042.50 minus $1,800.50, plus $2,000.00 in connection with the motion’s reply
and hearing).  (See Kerkeles v. City of
San Jose (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 88, 102 [a court may impose a rate reduction
of up to ten percent based on its exercise of discretion and without a more specific
explanation].)
Defendant
did not challenge the $2,352.59 in costs and expenses.
The
motion for attorney fees and expenses is GRANTED IN PART.  The Court awards Plaintiff $18,242.00 in attorney
fees and $2,352.59 in costs and expenses.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
