[TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING IN PART DEFENDANT’S
  DEMURRER
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 31, 2024



 
On
January 11, 2024, Plaintiffs William Jones and Robert Pina filed a first amended
complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants Ford Motor Company (“FMC”) and Southbay Ford
arising from Plaintiffs’ purchase of an allegedly defective vehicle.
On
February 13, 2024, FMC filed a demurrer. 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of
action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  When considering demurrers,
courts read the allegations liberally and in context, accepting the alleged facts
as true.  (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.)
A.        The Fifth Cause of Action Does Not Sufficiently
Allege a Relationship Between the Parties.
FMC
argues that the fifth cause of action for Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment does
not allege sufficient facts.  (Demurrer at
pp. 10-15.)
Fraud
based on concealment requires that “(1) the defendant must have concealed or suppressed
a material fact, (2) the defendant must have been under a duty to disclose the fact
to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed
the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been
unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed
or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the
fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage.”  (Bigler-Engler v. Breg, Inc. (2017) 7 Cal.App.5th
276, 310-311 (Bigler-Engler).)
An
essential element of intentional concealment includes the duty to disclose, which
must be based upon a transaction, or a special relationship, between plaintiff and
defendant.  (Id. at p. 314.)  “There are ‘four circumstances in which nondisclosure
or concealment may constitute actionable fraud: (1) when the defendant is in a fiduciary
relationship with the plaintiff; (2) when the defendant had exclusive knowledge
of material facts not known to the plaintiff; (3) when the defendant actively conceals
a material fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when the defendant makes partial representations
but also suppresses some material facts.’” 
(Id. at p. 311.)  “[O]ther than
the first instance, in which there must be a fiduciary relationship between the
parties, ‘the other three circumstances in which nondisclosure may be actionable
presuppose[ ] the existence of some other relationship between the plaintiff and
defendant in which a duty to disclose can arise. . . . “[W]here material facts are
known to one party and not to the other, failure to disclose them is not actionable
fraud unless there is some relationship between the parties which gives rise to
a duty to disclose such known facts.”  [Citation.]’  [Citation.]” 
(Hoffman v. 162 North Wolfe LLC (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 1178, 1187
(Hoffman).)
“Even
under the strict rules of common law pleading, one of the canons was that less particularity
is required when the facts lie more in the knowledge of the opposite party.”  (Alfaro v. Community Housing Improvement System
& Planning Assn., Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1384.)
Plaintiff alleges that FMC knew since at
least March 2018 that there was a transmission defect that caused hesitation and/or
delayed acceleration; harsh and/or hard shifting; jerking, shuddering, and/or juddering.  (See, e.g., FAC ¶¶ 51-62, 89.)  Because of these defects, “Plaintiffs unknowingly
exposed themselves to the risk of accident, injury, and/or liability to others as
a result of the nature or the Transmission Defect, which can lead to hesitation,
loss of power, and other shifting issues while driving at highway speeds.”  (FAC ¶ 63.) 
Plaintiffs did not know about these defects and problems, and FMC, who had
superior knowledge of the defect, did not disclose the defects when Plaintiffs purchased
the vehicle.  (FAC ¶¶ 63-64, 93.)   The allegations are specific
enough to allege the information that was concealed and the danger posed.  (See Jones
v. ConocoPhillips Co. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1187, 1199-1200.)
However,
Plaintiffs do not allege the existence of a relationship between the parties that
gives rise to a duty to disclose facts.  (See
Hoffman, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p. 1187.)  Plaintiffs allege only that “Defendant FMC was
under a duty to Plaintiffs to disclose” because it had superior knowledge before
Plaintiffs’ purchase.  (FAC ¶ 93.)  The demurrer is sustained on this ground.
B.        The Fifth Cause of Action is Not Barred
by the Economic Loss Rule.
FMC
argues that the fifth cause of action is barred by the economic loss rule.  (Demurrer at pp. 15-17.)  Under the economic loss rule, “[w]here a purchaser’s
expectations in a sale are frustrated because the product he bought is not working
properly, his remedy is said to be in contract alone, for he has suffered only ‘economic’
losses.”  (Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc.
v. Dana Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 979, 988 (Robinson), quotation marks
omitted.)  However, tort damages may be permitted
when the breach of contract is accompanied by a tort such as fraud.  (Id. at pp. 989-990.)  To plead around the economic loss rule, a party
must plead the existence of a duty that arises independent of any contractual duty
and independent injury, other than economic loss, that arises from the breach of
that duty.  (Id. at pp. 988-991.)
“[U]nder
California law, the economic loss rule does not bar [a claim] for fraudulent inducement
by concealment.  Fraudulent inducement claims
fall within an exception to the economic loss rule recognized by our Supreme Court”
in Robinson, and such claims allege fraudulent conduct that is independent
of the alleged warranty breaches.  (Dhital
v. Nissan North America, Inc. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 828, 843.)  The Supreme Court recently confirmed that “the
economic loss rule does not apply to limit recovery for intentional tort claims
like fraud.”  (Rattagan v. Uber Technologies,
Inc. (2024) 17 Cal.5th 1, 38.)  “A plaintiff
may assert a tort claim for fraudulent concealment based on conduct occurring in
the course of a contractual relationship, if the elements of the cause of action
can be established independently of the parties' contractual rights and obligations
and the tortious conduct exposes the plaintiff to a risk of harm beyond the reasonable
contemplation of the parties when they entered into the agreement.”  (Ibid.)
The
demurrer is overruled on this ground.
C.        Conclusion
The
demurrer is SUSTAINED IN PART and OVERRULED IN PART as set forth above.  Plaintiffs are granted 30 days’ leave to amend.
Moving
party to give notice.
