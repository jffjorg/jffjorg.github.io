And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively approved a settlement agreement between claimant Nolan Mernin, a minor, and Decedent's uninsured motorist insurer. The insurer will pay $300,000.00, which will be allocated for medical expenses, attorney fees, and costs, leaving a balance of $220,000.00 for the claimant. The court finds that the proposed settlement is fair and reasonable, and that the attorney fees, which are 25% of the funds, are also fair and reasonable. The court sets an order to show cause for proof of investment in a single-premium deferred annuity for January 31, 2025, and orders the moving party to give notice. The parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to do so.
