Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the case, citing a mandatory forum selection clause in the parties' subcontract agreement. The clause requires that all actions arising from the agreement be litigated in Westchester County, New York. The judge found that the plaintiff has not shown that application of the clause would be unfair or unreasonable, as the plaintiff's argument that the New York forum would not accomplish substantial justice due to the inability of key material witnesses to attend is not persuasive. The judge noted that California courts typically honor mandatory forum selection clauses without extensive analysis of factors relating to convenience. Therefore, the case is dismissed without prejudice, and the parties are instructed to notify the court if they intend to submit to the tentative ruling.
