Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the demurrer filed by Ford Motor Company in a lawsuit brought by William Jones and Robert Pina, alleging that Ford knew about a transmission defect in the vehicle but did not disclose it to the plaintiffs. The judge has sustained the demurrer in part, finding that the complaint does not sufficiently allege a relationship between the parties that gives rise to a duty to disclose facts. However, the judge has overruled the demurrer in part, finding that the complaint does plead around the economic loss rule, which bars claims for economic loss only. The judge has given the plaintiffs 30 days to amend their complaint and has ordered Ford Motor Company to give notice of the ruling.
