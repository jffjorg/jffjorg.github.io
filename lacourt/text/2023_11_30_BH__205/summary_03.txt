And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, 404 San Vicente Homeowners Association, to the financial elder abuse claim brought by the plaintiff, Marsah Rose Negrin. The Court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff has the opportunity to refile the claim in a way that addresses the issues raised by the demurrer.

The Court found that the financial elder abuse claim is fatally uncertain as to what funds are owed to the plaintiff under the CC&R's (Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions) for the Property. The plaintiff has not alleged how the HOA took, hid, appropriated or retained the plaintiff's property, which is a necessary element of the financial elder abuse claim.

The Court also noted that the plaintiff's allegations regarding the water leak and damage to the drywall, heating system, and hardwood floors do not support a claim for financial elder abuse. The HOA's alleged failure to conduct regular and customary maintenance of the common areas and its alleged agreement to pay for the repairs do not constitute financial elder abuse.

The Court assumed all facts pleaded in the complaint are true, but did not assume the truth of conclusions of law. The Court also noted that the plaintiff has the burden of showing that the pleading can be amended successfully.
