  Case Number:  22SMCV00971    Hearing Date:   November 30, 2023    Dept:  205 HEARING DATE:  November 30, 2023 JUDGE/DEPT:  Moreton/Beverly Hills, 205 CASE NAME: Berritto Enterprises, LLC v. Taylor Woods CASE NUMBER:  22SMCV00971  COMP. FILED:  June 27, 2022    PROCEEDINGS:  REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT MOVING PARTY:  Berritto Enterprises, LLC  RESPONDING PARTY: Taylor Woods  BACKGROUND This is a fraudulent conveyance case.  Plaintiff Berritto Enterprises LLC entered into an agreement to invest $1 million in Sky Holdings.  Defendant Taylor Woods owns and manages Sky Holdings.  The investment was to be used to purchase 17 distressed hotels from Eagle Hospitality Trust, a public lodging REIT, which never occurred.   Ultimately, Plaintiff demanded the return of its investment funds.  The monies were never returned.  Plaintiff also demanded to inspect the books and records of Sky Holdings.  Defendant failed to make the books and records available for inspection.   On June 27, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendant.  The Complaint alleges five claims for (1) fraudulent conveyance, (2) money had and received, (3) conversion, (4) breach of fiduciary duty, and (5) fraud.  The Complaint seeks damages in excess of $1,000,000.    Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing Defendant was personally served on November 14, 2022.  Defendant was obligated to respond within 30 days. Defendant did not do so. Plaintiff successfully requested the entry of Defendant’s default, which was entered by the Clerk’s Office on September 26, 2023.  Plaintiff requested a default judgment on October 26, 2023. Plaintiff served Defendant by mail with both the Request for Entry of Default and Request for Default Judgment.  Defendant has not appeared.  RELIEF REQUESTED  Default judgment against Defendant for a total of $1,001,770.43 consisting of (1) $1,000,000 in damages and (2) $1,770.43 in costs.   ANALYSIS  Code of Civil Procedure section 585 sets forth the two options for obtaining a default judgment. First, where the plaintiff’s complaint¿seeks compensatory damages only, in a sum certain which is readily ascertainable from the allegations of the complaint or statement of damages, the clerk may enter the default judgment for that amount. However, if the relief requested in the complaint is more complicated, consisting of either nonmonetary relief, or monetary relief in amounts which require either an accounting, additional evidence, or the exercise of judgment to ascertain, the plaintiff must request entry of judgment by the court. In such cases, the plaintiff must affirmatively establish his entitlement to the specific judgment requested.¿ (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 287.) Section 585 also allows for interest, costs and attorney fees, where otherwise allowed by law. (Code of Civ. Proc.  585(a).)  Multiple specific documents are required, such as: (1) form CIV 100, (2) a brief summary of the case; (3) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (4) interest computations as necessary; (5) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (CRC Rule 3.1800.)  Here, Plaintiff has properly complied with all the substantive and procedural requirements for a default judgment. Substantively, Plaintiff declares via declaration that there have been damages in the amount of $1,000,000.  The evidence submitted is authenticated by further declaration.  Procedurally, Plaintiff properly served Defendant more than 30 days prior to requesting entry of default and default judgment, correctly completed JC Form CIV-100 in a manner that would not void or put at issue the entry of default, provided a declaration of non-military status, requested damages in amounts supported by the filings and not in excess of the amount stated in the Complaint, dismissed the fictitious defendants, and filed a proposed judgment (JUD-100).   As default has already been entered and there has been no appearance or filing whatsoever from Defendant, default judgment is appropriate here.   CONCLUSION AND ORDER   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff Berritto Enterprises LLC’s Request for Default Judgment is GRANTED as to Defendant Taylor Woods.  Default judgment in the amount of $1,001,770.43 is awarded in favor of Plaintiff.
