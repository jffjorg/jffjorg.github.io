And here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendants, Anglin Services LLC and Shannell Lake. The dispute arises from a breach of a loan agreement, where Anglin Services LLC defaulted on a loan of $42,500 and Shannell Lake executed a personal guarantee. The plaintiff, Forwardline Financial LLC, filed a complaint and served the defendants by substitute service, but only made one attempt at personal service. The judge holds that the plaintiff did not properly serve the defendants and therefore denies the request for default judgment. The plaintiff is seeking damages of $36,785.80, plus interest and attorney's fees, but the judge requires additional evidence and a more thorough analysis before granting the requested judgment.
