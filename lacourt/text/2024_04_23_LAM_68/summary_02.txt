  - "The statute's 'legislative history indicates the California Legislature sought a clear and unambiguous rule for courts to apply in determining whether late payment of arbitration fees by a drafting party constitutes a material breach of an arbitration agreement.'"
  - "The lack of any address in the statute allowing for a mistake or excusable neglect exemption constitutes an intentional reflection of the public policy disfavoring any such potential imposition of burden on the employee and imposing the consequences on the non-complying party."
