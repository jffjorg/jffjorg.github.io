And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to cancel the arbitration and impose sanctions on the defendant. The defendant failed to pay arbitration fees within 30 days, despite receiving multiple notices and reminders. The court finds that the defendant's failure to pay was not excused by any valid reason, and that the defendant's counsel's delay in responding to the notices was not a valid excuse.

The court awards the plaintiff $35,647.50 in attorney's fees and costs, and imposes sanctions of $9,950 on the defendant and its counsel. The court requires the defendant to pay the sanctions within 30 days.

The court's decision is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1281.98 and 1281.99, which provide for strict enforcement of the 30-day deadline for payment of arbitration fees. The court finds that the defendant's failure to pay the fees was a material breach of the arbitration agreement, and that the defendant's failure to provide a valid excuse for the delay was not justified.
