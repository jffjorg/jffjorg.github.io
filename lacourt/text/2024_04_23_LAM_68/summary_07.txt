And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

**Tentative Ruling**

The court denies the defendant's motion to compel further responses to the plaintiff's Request for Admissions (set one). The defendant's amended notice of motion was filed less than 16 court days from the hearing date, which is untimely. The original notice of motion was incomplete and will not support the amended notice. The plaintiff properly objects to the untimeliness of the motion. The court declines to consider the merits of the motion due to the lack of a sealed record and the failure to provide unredacted copies of the operative items. The court advises the defendant to adhere to cutoff dates and to avoid voluminous and contentious discovery requests, which may lead to referral to a referee.
