And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the defendant's motion to vacate the default. The defendant, Miguel Lopez, filed a motion to vacate the default, claiming that he had placed an answer in the court's drop box but it was never filed or registered in the case docket. The court finds that the motion is untimely, as it was filed more than 180 days after the default was entered. The court lacks jurisdiction to consider the motion, and therefore denies it.
