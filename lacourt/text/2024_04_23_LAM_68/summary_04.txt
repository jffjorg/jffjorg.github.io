And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, denying the Plaintiffs' motion to compel the deposition of Michel Moore, Chief of Police of the Los Angeles Police Department. The Plaintiffs had sought to depose Chief Moore, who was directly aware of the Control Bicycle Training Program and department policies, and had knowledge of the circumstances and cause of death of Officer Tipping, who suffered a fatal head injury during a training exercise. The Judge ruled that, even though Chief Moore is no longer employed by the City of Los Angeles due to retirement, the court lacks authority to order a former employer to produce a former employee for deposition.
