And here is a brief English summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has ruled on the demurrer filed by the defendants, United Airlines, Inc. and Aetna Life Insurance Company, against the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Beach District Surgery Center. The court has determined that the plaintiff's claims for negligent misrepresentation and promissory estoppel are not preempted by the Employee Retirement Securities Act of 1974 (ERISA). The court has also found that the plaintiff has stated a claim for negligent misrepresentation, as it alleged that the defendants misrepresented the terms of the patients' benefit plans and intended to induce the plaintiff's reliance on those misrepresentations. Additionally, the court has found that the plaintiff has stated a claim for promissory estoppel, as it alleged that the defendants promised to pay the plaintiff for medical services provided and the plaintiff relied on those promises to its detriment. The demurrer is therefore overruled, and the case will proceed to the next stage.
