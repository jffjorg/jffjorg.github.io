BACKGROUND
 
            Plaintiff Beach
District Surgery Center sued defendants United Airlines, Inc. and Aetna Life
Insurance Company on August 17, 2023. Plaintiff filed its operative first
amended complaint (“FAC”) on February 26, 2024, asserting causes of action for
negligent misrepresentation and promissory estoppel.
 
            As alleged in the FAC, Plaintiff
is a California-based medical provider. (FAC, ¶ 1.) Two of its patients,
designated “GA” and “VM” in the FAC, receive health insurance through United’s
employee benefit plan. (Id., ¶ 20.) Aetna acts as United’s agent “in
connection with stating the manner of payment for medical services and
providing other administrative services relating to the Patient’s and
[United’s] health plan.” (Id., ¶ 3.) 
 
            GA
and VM received services from Plaintiff in 2022. (Id., ¶¶ 20, 39.) Prior
to their appointments, Plaintiff verified with Aetna that their insurance would
reimburse for services provided. (Id., ¶¶ 21-30, 40-49.) After
confirming its patients’ coverage, Plaintiff billed $28,050.00 and $13,200.00,
respectively, to Defendants for reimbursement. (Id., ¶¶ 37, 56.)
Defendants paid $0.00 in the first instance, and slightly more than $2,000.00
in the second. (Ibid.)
 
            
ANALYSIS
 
When considering a demurrer, a court reads the allegations
stated in the challenged pleading liberally and in context, and “treat[s] the
demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Serrano v. Priest (1971) 5
Cal.3d 584, 591.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the
complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of
action.” (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) The court treats all facts alleged in the complaint as
true. (Picton v. Anderson Union High School District (1996) 50
Cal.App.4th 726, 732.)
 
A.    ERISA Preemption
 
            Defendants
argue that Plaintiff’s claims are preempted by the federal Employee Retirement
Securities Act of 1974 (“ERISA”). They are not.
 
            Morris
B. Silver M.D., Inc. v. International Longshore & Warehouse Union
(2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 793 (Silver) controls. Where, as here, a plan
administrator promises payments to a third party, then fails to make them, the
dispute does not arise from the terms of the relevant benefit plan, and it is
not preempted by ERISA. (Id., at pp. 802-803 [surveying precedent].) 
 
            Defendant
attempts to distinguish Silver by arguing that the defendant in that
case had promised payment in a certain amount, while Defendant’s promise here depended
on the terms of Plaintiff’s patients’ benefit plans. That is not what is
pleaded. Plaintiff’s FAC is on all fours with Silver, where the
plaintiff-provider stated a claim based on the defendant’s statements that it
would pay according to the usual terms of the plan (a certain percentage of
UCR, up to an out-of-pocket maximum, and less a deductible). (See id.,
at p. 796, fn. 2.)
 
            Plaintiff’s
claims are not preempted.
 
B.        Negligent
Misrepresentation
 
            The elements
of a claim for negligent misrepresentation are “‘[M]isrepresentation of a past
or existing material fact, without reasonable ground for believing it to be
true, and with intent to induce another's reliance on the fact misrepresented;
ignorance of the truth and justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation by the
party to whom it was directed; and resulting damage… [citation omitted]” (Hydro-Mill
Co. Inc. v. Hayward, Tilton & RolappIns. Associates, Inc. (2004) 115
Cal.App.4th 1145, 1154 [citation omitted].) 
 
            Defendant argues Plaintiff has not
specifically pleaded the elements of its negligent misrepresentation claim. The
Court disagrees. Plaintiff alleges Aetna employees, who spoke on behalf of
United, at various times misrepresented that GA and VM’s claims would be paid. Plaintiff
alleges Defendant should have known the terms of its own coverage (see FAC, ¶¶
60-61). And Plaintiff alleges Defendant intended to induce Plaintiff’s reliance
on its statements.
 
            The demurrer to the first cause of
action is overruled.
 
C.        Promissory
Estoppel
 
“‘The elements of a promissory estoppel
claim are “(1) a promise clear
and unambiguous in its terms; (2) reliance by the party
to whom the promise
is made; (3) [the] reliance
must be both reasonable and foreseeable;
and (4) the party asserting the estoppel
must be injured
by his reliance.”
[Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Jones v. Wachovia Bank
(2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 935, 945.) 
 
            Plaintiff
has stated a claim for promissory estoppel. It alleges it spoke with
Defendant’s representatives, who promised Plaintiff that if they provided
medical services they would be paid a certain amount. Plaintiff provided
services in reasonable reliance on this promise, and Plaintiff was not repaid.
 
            The
demurrer to the second cause of action is overruled.
