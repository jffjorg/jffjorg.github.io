And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to set aside and vacate the default and default judgment. The defendant has demonstrated that it failed to act out of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. The defendant's principal attested that he mistakenly believed the lawsuit was similar to a scam he experienced in 2021, and it was not until January 2024 that he was informed of the seriousness of the action against him. The law favors disposition of disputes on the merits, and the defendant's declaration demonstrates good-faith confusion about the state of the lawsuit. The court does not address the defendant's arguments that the plaintiff lacks standing to sue or that the defendant made best efforts to correct accessibility problems on its website.
