And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling in a lawsuit filed by Isaiah Dryer against The Regents of the University of California and others. The lawsuit alleges employment discrimination, failure to prevent discrimination, and other related claims. The defendant filed a demurrer to the plaintiff's second amended complaint, arguing that the claims should be dismissed. The court finds that the defendant did not meet and confer with the plaintiff prior to filing the demurrer, as required by California law. The court therefore orders the parties to meet and confer by April 22, 2024, and sets a new hearing date of May 17, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
