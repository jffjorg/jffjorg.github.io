BACKGROUND
This
action arises out of an employment relationship. Plaintiff filed this action on
April 28, 2023. 
 
On
December 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative Second Amended Complaint against
Defendant, following a stipulation and order to amend the pleading, for: (1) discrimination,
(2) failure to prevent discrimination, (3) failure to engage in a timely good
faith interactive process, (4) failure to provide reasonable accommodation, (5)
retaliation, (6) harassment, and (7) failure to prevent harassment. 
 
On
February 26, 2024, Defendant filed the instant demurrer to each cause of action
in the Second Amended Complaint. On April 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
opposition and supporting declaration representing that Defendant did not meet
and confer adequately prior to filing the demurrer and that Plaintiff is
agreeable to amending the pleading to be more detailed. Defendant has not
replied.
 
MEET
AND CONFER
Before
filing a demurrer, demurring party is required to meet and confer with the
party who filed the pleading demurred to for the purposes of determining
whether an agreement can be reached through a filing of an amended pleading
that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer. (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.41.) 
 
Here,
the Court finds that Defendant has not sufficiently met and conferred prior to
the filing of the demurrer as required by CCP § 430.41. 
 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court orders the parties to meet and confer by April 22,
2024 and, if they are unable to reach a resolution of all issues covered by the
Demurrer, Plaintiff’s opposition is due May 3, 2024 and any reply is due May
10, 2024.  The hearing on the Demurrer is
CONTINUED to May 17, 2024 at 8:30 a.m..
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
        
 Dated this 15th day of April 2024
