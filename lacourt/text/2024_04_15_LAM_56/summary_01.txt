And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion to compel further response to Form Interrogatory 11.1 by the defendant, Dirt Dog Inc. The interrogatory asks if the plaintiff, Isabel Rendon, has filed any personal injury claims or made any written claims or demands for compensation in the past 10 years. The plaintiff responded with an objection on grounds of relevance, but the court finds this objection to be without merit. The court orders the plaintiff to provide a further response to the interrogatory, including information about the claims to which the defendant refers, within 20 days of the date of this order.
