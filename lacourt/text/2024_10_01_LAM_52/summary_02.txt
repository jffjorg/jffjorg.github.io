And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions filed by plaintiff Gail Wiggan. The first motion is for a jury trial, which is not necessary as plaintiff has already indicated her request for a jury trial in her case management statement. The motion is denied. The second motion is to stay proceedings pending the determination of a motion to consolidate cases. The court previously found this action to be related to another case, but denied the motion to consolidate without prejudice. The plaintiff shows no valid reason to stay this action, and the motion is denied. The judge's ruling is based on California state laws, including the California Constitution and the Code of Civil Procedure.
