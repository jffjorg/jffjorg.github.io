 Case Number:  22STCV28415    Hearing Date:   October 1, 2024    Dept:  52 Tentative Ruling: 
            Plaintiff
Gail Wiggan’s (1) Motion for Jury Trial and (2) Motion to Stay Proceedings            
Motion
for Jury Trial
Plaintiff Gail Wiggan moves for a jury trial.  A motion is “[a]n application for an
order.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1003.)  No order is required for plaintiff to
exercise her right to a jury trial.  Code
of Civil Procedure section 631, subdivision (a) provides, “The right to a trial
by jury as declared by Section 16 of Article I of the California Constitution
shall be preserved to the parties inviolate.  In civil cases, a jury may only be waived” in
one of six ways specified in section 631, subdivision (f).  
Plaintiff’s case management statement indicates she requests a jury
trial.  This motion is unnecessary.
Plaintiff’s motion for jury trial is denied.
Motion to
Stay Proceedings
Plaintiff Gail Wiggan moves to stay proceedings in this action pending
determination of her motion to consolidate cases.  In July 2024, the court found this action
related to Gail Wiggan v. Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club, et
al., No. 22STCV28591.  The court
denied plaintiff’s motion to consolidate the cases without prejudice.  Plaintiff shows no valid reason to stay this
action.
Plaintiff’s motion to stay proceedings is denied.
