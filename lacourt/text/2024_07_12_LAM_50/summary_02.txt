And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding a future hearing. The court notes that the plaintiff's counsel filed and served supplemental declarations via electronic mail on June 18, 2024, which is outside the 16-court-day deadline required by Code of Civil Procedure Section 1005. Additionally, the court notes that the supplemental declarations were served via electronic mail, which extends the deadline by two court days, but the plaintiff does not appear to have been authorized to file the declarations. The court declines to consider the late-filed supplemental declarations. The court also notes that the plaintiff's evidentiary objections are misnumbered.
