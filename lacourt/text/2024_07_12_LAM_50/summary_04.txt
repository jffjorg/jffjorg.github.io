And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the County's and City's demurrers to the TAC (Tentative Amended Complaint). The Judge notes that the Fifth Amended Complaint was submitted, but not filed, and that the docket does not show Plaintiff was authorized to file it. The Judge also notes that some causes of action in the FAC (First Amended Complaint) do not specify which defendants are being sued. The City asserts that the eleventh cause of action is an added claim without authorization, and the Judge agrees, sustaining the City's demurrer to this cause of action. The Judge also notes that the first cause of action does not identify a specific statute or regulation imposing a mandatory duty on the City. The Judge's ruling is based on Government Code section 815.6 and the case of Harris v. Wachovia Mortgage, FSB.
