[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUESTS FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff
Irth Communications, LLC (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default judgment
against Defendant Biotricity, Inc. Plaintiff seeks judgment in the total amount
of $109,293.45, comprising $97,431.23 in damages, $9,177.22 in interest, $2,100.00
in attorney’s fees, and $585.00 in costs. 
The
Court notes that Plaintiff has corrected the defects identified in the Court’s
May 17, 2024 Order on Plaintiff’s prior request for default judgment. 
However,
the Court notes that the Declaration of Andrew William Haag in support of the
request indicates, inter alia, that “[t]he interest rate calculation is
based on the rate of 1.5% per month (or 18% per year).” (Haag Decl., ¶
33, emphasis added.) Pursuant to LA¿SC rule 3.206¿, “[i]f interest is requested in
excess of the usury limitations of ¿California Constitution Article XV, Section
1¿, proof must be presented of plaintiff’s exemption from the usury limitations
unless an exemption has been pleaded in the complaint and admitted by the entry
of default.” The Complaint does not appear to plead any exemption from the
usury limitations and Plaintiff has not provided an explanation for its
entitlement to any exemption.¿¿
In
addition, Plaintiff seeks interest for the period of November 13, 2023 to May
21, 2024. (Haag Decl., ¶ 33.) Plaintiff states that there are 191 days between
these dates. (Ibid.) However, it appears that there are 190 days between
November 13, 2023 and May 21, 2024. 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for default judgment
without prejudice. The Court will discuss with Plaintiff a schedule for
resubmission of the default judgment package.
