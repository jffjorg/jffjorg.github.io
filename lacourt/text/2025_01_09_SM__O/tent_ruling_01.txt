REASONING
 
I.                  
Demurrer to 4th cause of action for
Aiding and Abetting – SUSTAINED without leave to amend
 
“The
plaintiff may not amend the complaint to add a new cause of action without
having obtained permission to do so, unless the new cause of action is within
the scope of the order granting leave to amend.” (Harris v. Wachovia
Mortgage, FSB (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1018, 1023.)
 
Plaintiff
Jeremy Findel (“Findel”) was not given leave to amend the FAC to add the cause
of action for aiding and abetting as to the Blaze Pizza Defendants within the
10-17-23 Minute Order, nor was this new cause of action “within the scope of
the order granting leave to amend.” (Ibid.; see 10-17-23 Minute Order.)
Thus, the Demurrer to the 4th cause of action for Aiding and
Abetting is SUSTAINED without leave to amend. 

 
II.               
Demurrer to 5th cause of action for
Civil Conspiracy – SUSTAINED without leave to amend
 
When
a court grants a demurrer with leave to amend, a plaintiff is limited to making
amendments as authorized by the court’s order. (See People ex rel. Dept.
Pub. Wks. v. Clausen (1967) 248 Cal.App.2d 770, 785 [when a Court sustains
a demurer with leave to amend “the granting of leave to amend is not a
sanctioning of a particular amendment which the pleader has submitted to the
trial court. Rather, as pointed out in Taliaferro, such granting of leave to
amend must be construed as permission to the pleader to amend the cause of
action which he pleaded in the pleading to which the demurrer has been
sustained.”)
 
Findel
was not given leave to amend the 5th cause of action to add Blaze Pizza
Defendants to the cause of action within the 10-17-23 Minute Order sustaining
the Demurrer to the FAC with leave to amend. (See 10-17-23 Minute Order.)
Findel can only make amendments as authorized by court order, and thus Findel
did not have the authority to include the Blaze Pizza Defendants to the civil
conspiracy cause of action. 
 
The
Demurrer to the 5th cause of action for civil conspiracy is
SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
 
III.            
Demurrer to 7th cause of action for Violation
of Cal. Bus. Prof. Code § 17200, et seq. (“UCL”)”– SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO
AMEND
 
Findel
has not included any additional facts or revisions to the 7th cause
of action in the SAC that can be attributed to the Blaze Pizza Defendants (See
SAC, ¶¶ 198–214.) Findel’s 7th cause of action thus contains the
same defects as to the Blaze Pizza Defendants in the SAC as were at issue in
the FAC. Specifically, Findel does not include any factual allegations as to
the Blaze Pizza Defendants to plead their assistance and participation in the
matter, representations made to Findel, their benefit received, and what duty was
owed to Findel. Additionally, Blaze Pizza Defendants argue the claim is
unsupported by any other cause of action within the SAC as to pertains to Blaze
Pizza Defendants specifically since Findel “continued to really on his UVTA
causes of action which are no longer plead against the Blaze Pizza Defendants.”
(Demurrer, p. 17: 9–14; see SAC, ¶ 204.)
 
Thus, the Demurrer to
the 7th cause of action for violation of Cal. Bus. Prof. Code § 17200, et seq.
(“UCL”) is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
