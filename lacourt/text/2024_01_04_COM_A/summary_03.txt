And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting relief from jury waiver to the plaintiff, Ronnisha Potts, et al. The plaintiffs failed to post jury fees prior to the Case Management Conference, resulting in a waiver of jury trial. The defendant, House of Winston Funeral Service, Inc., objects to the amended motion, citing that it lacks a notice setting forth grounds on which the motion is made. However, the court has considered the merits of the opposition and found no prejudice to the defendant. The court notes that a party may waive jury trial by failing to timely pay jury fees, but the right to jury trial is fundamental and doubts are resolved in favor of allowing a jury trial. The court grants the motion and orders the plaintiffs to deposit fees within 10 days.
