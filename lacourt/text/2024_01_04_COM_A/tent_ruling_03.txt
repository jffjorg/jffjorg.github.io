[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING RELIEF FROM JURY WAIVER
 
      Plaintiffs
failed to post jury fees prior to the Case Management Conference held on
September 25, 2023, as required by statute, resulting in a waiver of jury
trial. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 631.) Plaintiffs seek relief from waiver. Plaintiffs
initially filed the motion on October 4, 2023, believing a hearing date was not
required. Additionally, reservations in this court were not permitted. Therefore,
Plaintiffs filed this amended motion and set a hearing date. 
      Defendant
objects on grounds the amended motion does not include a notice setting forth
grounds on which the motion is made. Plaintiff failed to promptly move for
relief. 
      The
Court has considered Plaintiff’s amended motion although it does not contain a separate
notice. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1010.) A party may be deemed to have waived any irregularity
by appearing at the hearing, opposing the motion, not asking for a continuance,
and not demonstrating any prejudice resulting from the defect. (Carlton
v. Quint (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 690, 697.) The Court has considered the
merits of Defendant’s opposition; no prejudice is suffered.
      A party
waives jury trial by failing to timely pay the jury fee although the court has
discretion to grant relief where there has been no prejudice to the other party
or to the Court from an inadvertent waiver.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 631; Wharton v. Superior Court (1991)
231 Cal.App.3d 100, 104.) Because the right to jury trial is fundamental,
doubts are resolved in favor of allowing a jury trial. (Tesoro
del Valle Master Homeowners Assn. v. Griffin (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th
619, 638.)
      Plaintiffs
did not deposit jury fees because they mistakenly believed a deposit was not
required since the Court signed a fee waiver. Plaintiffs intend to file a new
request to waive additional court fees “if the motion is granted.” (Am. Mot. 3:1-2.)
However, on September 25, 2023, the Court ordered Plaintiffs to deposit jury
fees, which Plaintiffs ignored. 
      Notwithstanding
the foregoing, and given the lack of prejudice shown by Defendant, the Court
GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion. Plaintiffs are ordered to deposit fees within 10
days.
