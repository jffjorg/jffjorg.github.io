And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling indicates that the demurrer to the complaint will be taken off calendar due to failure to provide statutory notice to the plaintiff. The plaintiff, Jose Flores-Mendez, alleges that he suffered an injury while employed with Plentitude Transportation, Inc. (Defendant) and is seeking compensation for fraud, intentional tort, and emotional distress. The defendants argue that the allegations are insufficient, barred by the statute of limitations, and uncertain. The court notes that the defendants served the demurrer on December 12, 2023, which is two days after the required deadline. As a result, the hearing on the demurrer will be taken off calendar.
