And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled to sustain the demurrer to the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC) without leave to amend. The Plaintiff, Jailyn Robateau, alleges claims for negligence and premises liability against Nationwide Guard Services (NGS) arising from the conditions of her work environment. The Plaintiff claims that NGS did not provide her with proper worker's compensation forms and did not address her complaints about the working conditions.

The Defendant argues that the complaint is barred by the exclusivity provisions of the Worker's Compensation Act (WCA), which is the sole and exclusive remedy for recovering damages sustained for injuries sustained while in the course and scope of employment. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's claims are indeed barred by the WCA because she was injured while actively working for NGS and completing her work shift.

The Judge grants the Defendant's request for judicial notice of the Plaintiff's application to the Worker's Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB) to adjudicate her claim, which is not reasonably subject to dispute. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff does not argue nor establish that the claims alleged here are exempt from the exclusivity provisions.

As a result, the Judge has sustained the demurrer to the FAC without leave to amend, effectively dismissing the Plaintiff's claims.
