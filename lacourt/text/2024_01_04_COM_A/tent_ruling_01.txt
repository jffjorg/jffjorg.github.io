[TENTATIVE] ORDER TAKING OFF
 CALENDAR THE HEARING ON DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT
 
      The
complaint alleges that Plaintiff suffered injury on October 10, 2017, while
employed with Defendant, Plentitude Transportation, Inc. (“Defendant”). Plaintiff
continued to work until he was terminated as he was unaware of his rights as an
injured worker. Plaintiff alleges claims for fraud, intentional tort, and
emotional distress.
      Defendants
argue that Plaintiff has not alleged facts to support the alleged claims
because they do not state specific facts, are barred by the statute of
limitations, and are uncertain. Plaintiff did not list an email address or fax
number where Plaintiff can be reached. Plaintiff did not file an opposition.
      Service
by facsimile transmission is permitted only where the parties agree, and a
written confirmation of that agreement is made. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1013 subd. (e).) Self represented parties such as Plaintiff
are exempt from mandatory electronic filing imposed by statute but may consent to
electronic service. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1010.6 subd. (c)(2) and (f)(2).)
      The
demurrer is taken off calendar for failure to provide statutory notice to
Plaintiff. Defendants were required to serve the demurrer by December 8, 2023 (Friday)
to allow for 16 court days of notice, increased by two calendar days to account
for service by overnight mail. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005 subd. (b).) Defendant
served the demurrer on December 12, 2023.
