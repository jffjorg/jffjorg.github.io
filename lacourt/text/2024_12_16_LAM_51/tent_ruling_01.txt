STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On April 13, 2021, Plaintiff Sabag Holdings, LLC
(“Plaintiff/Judgment Creditor”) filed a Complaint against  Defendant SoCal
Building Ventures, LLC (“Defendant/Judgment Debtor”), and DOES 1 through 10,
inclusive for: (1) Breach of Contract on Promissory Note; and (2) Common
Count.  
 
On November 17, 2022, this Court entered Judgment pursuant
to a Stipulation of Judgment and Order (“Stipulation for Judgment”), in favor
of Judgment Creditor against Judgment Debtor in the amount of $9,000,000.00,
including costs, interest, and attorney fees.  
 
On March 26, 2024, Judgment Creditor filed a Motion for
Order Charging Interest of Judgment Debtor in Specified Entities which the
court GRANTED.
 
On May 3, 2024, the court GRANTED Judgment in Favor of Plaintiff.

 
On May 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed Notice of Entry of Judgment
on Third-Party Claim.
 
On May 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed Notice of Entry of Order
Charging Interest of Judgment Debtor in Specific Entities.
 
On June 14, 2024, Jason Caramanis, as Trustee for Ya-Ya
Legacy Trust (Caramanis) filed the instant Motion for Attorney’s Fees pursuant
to CCP § 720.260(c). On December 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On
December 9, 2024, Caramanis filed a reply.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
 
The court GRANTS Caramanis’ Request for
Judicial Notice in its entirety. (Evid. Code § 452(d), (h); See Kalnoki v. First American Trustee Servicing
Solutions, LLC (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 23,37.) However, the court only takes
judicial notice of the foregoing documents only as to “the existence, content
and authenticity of public records and other specified documents”; it does not
take judicial notice of the truth of the factual matters asserted in those
documents. (Dominguez v. Bonta (2022)
87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.)¿¿
 
Attorney’s
Fees and Costs
 
Attorney’s fees are recoverable when authorized by contract,
statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).)¿¿ 
 
¿Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5,
subdivision (a)(10), attorney fees when authorized by contract, statute or law
are allowable as costs and may be awarded upon a noticed motion pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (c)(5).¿
 
A prevailing party may recover costs by filing a memorandum
of costs. 
¿ 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Caramanis moves for attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to
CCP § 720.260(c). 
 
Plaintiff  does not
challenge the costs memorandum requesting $1,361.33 in costs. 
 
Plaintiff does challenge the awarding of attorney fees contending
that attorney fees are not recoverable under CCP § 720.260(c).
 
Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 720.260(c)
provides: 
 
“(c) An
undertaking given by the creditor under this chapter shall:
(1) Be made in favor of the secured
party or lienholder.
(2) Indemnify the secured party or
lienholder against any loss, liability, damages, costs, and attorney's fees,
incurred by reason of the enforcement proceedings.
(3) Be conditioned on a final judgment
that the security interest or lien of the third person is entitled to priority
over the creditor's lien.”
This statute does not authorize fees “incurred in the action
on the undertaking.” (Franke v. BAM
Building Co. (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 224, 236.) This is the only means
Caramanis moved to recover fees.[1]
(Mot. 8:22-9:7.) 
 
Accordingly, Caramanis’ Motion for Attorney’s Fees and
Costs is Granted in part and Denied in part.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Costs
awarded in the amount of $1,361.33.
2.      Motion
for Attorney’s Fees is DENIED.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
