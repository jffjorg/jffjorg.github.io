And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for award of attorney's fees and costs filed by Jason Caramanis, as Trustee for Ya-Ya Legacy Trust. The motion was filed under Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 720.260(c) and sought $19,218.50 in attorney's fees and $1,361.33 in costs. The Court grants the motion in part, awarding the costs, but denies the motion for attorney's fees.

The Court's ruling is based on the fact that CCP § 720.260(c) only authorizes fees incurred in the enforcement proceedings, and not fees incurred in the action on the undertaking. The Court also takes judicial notice of the documents filed by Caramanis, but only as to the existence, content, and authenticity of the documents, and not as to the truth of the factual matters asserted in those documents.

The Court's decision is based on the analysis that the attorney's fees are not recoverable under CCP § 720.260(c) because the fees were incurred in the action on the undertaking, and not in the enforcement proceedings. The Court also notes that the prevailing party may recover costs by filing a memorandum of costs, and that the costs requested by Caramanis are reasonable.

The Court's ruling is subject to change upon the receipt of further briefing or argument, and the moving party is required to give notice of the Court's decision.
