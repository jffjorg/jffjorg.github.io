And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel filed by plaintiff Francisco Morales against defendant General Motors, LLC. The court grants in part the motions, requiring the defendant to provide further responses and produce documents within 30 days.

The court orders the defendant to produce responses to certain interrogatories, including full and complete responses to questions 14, 38, 41, 42, 43, 55, and form interrogatory 12.1. The court also orders the defendant to produce a narrative description in response to interrogatory 39, but allows the defendant to provide a general description of the duty or process engaged in by each individual.

The court denies certain requests for production, including request 40, 9, and 31. The court orders the defendant to produce a full and complete response and all responsive documents as to all documents in its possession, custody or control, except for requests that ask for "all documents" which "evidence, describe, relate, or refer to" the number of California owners who have made complaints. The court allows the defendant to provide only documents that evidence that number, rather than all documents that refer or relate to that number.
