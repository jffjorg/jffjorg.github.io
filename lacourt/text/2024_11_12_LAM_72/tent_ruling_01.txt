CITY OF EL MONTE,

 Hearing Date:  November 12, 2024
 Calendar Number:  5



 
 
 
Plaintiff City of El Monte (“Plaintiff”) moves for summary
adjudication against Defendant Jay Hooper (“Hooper”) on the first, second,
third, and fourth claims in Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint (“FAC”).
 
The Court GRANTS summary adjudication on the first, third,
and fourth claims.
 
The Court DENIES summary adjudication on the second claim.
This claim appears to be merely duplicative of Plaintiff’s narcotics abatement
claim, which operates under the theory that the use of the Property for
psilocybin production was a nuisance. 
 
While the Court will grant summary adjudication of liability
on these claims, the Court requests argument as to whether the record is
sufficient to grant the requested damages. 
Case law directs the Court to consider the sophistication and net worth
of Hooper in setting the penalty.  The
Court asks Plaintiff to address whether there is evidence in the record to
allow the Court to make this determination.
 
 
Background
 
This case relates to illegal activity that allegedly
occurred at a property managed by Hooper. The following facts are taken from
Plaintiff’s separate statement. The Court resolves ambiguities of fact in favor
of Hooper, the nonmoving party.
 
 Hooper is and was the
manager of Defendant Crown Estate Holding, LLC (“Crown”). (Undisputed Fact
(“UF”) 2.)
 
On April 13, 2017, Crown purchased the real property located
at 9860, 9866, 9680, and 9874 Gidley Street, El Monte, California 91731 (the
“Property”). (UF 1.) Crown has been the only owner at all relevant times. (UF
1.) In his capacity as manager of Crown, Hooper had control over the Property.
(UF 3.)
 
No Certificate of Occupancy was issued for the Property. (UF
5.)
 
Crown and Hooper did not conduct regular on-site inspections
of the Property to ensure compliance with municipal, building and safety codes,
and did not have proper security services monitoring and patrolling the
Property, including after business hours. (UF 15.) Hooper and his facility
manager Jesus Balthazar were regularly present at the Property during business
hours. (UF 16.)
 
On October 31, 2017, Plaintiff’s Code Enforcement Division (“Code
Enforcement”) inspected the Property and found a business operating at the
Property without a business license or Certificate of Occupancy. (Donavanik
Decl. ¶ 8.) On a re-inspection on November 30, 2017, the business was vacated.
 
On February 18, 2020, the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality
Control Board (“Water Board”) determined that there were elevated levels of
chlorinated solvents in the soil, soil gas, and groundwater beneath the
Property and required the Property owners to conduct a site assessment and
submit a technical report for subsurface investigation. (Donavanik Decl. ¶ 9.)
 
On April 27, 2020, the El Monte Police Department discovered
an illegal marijuana growing operation located at the Property. (Snook Decl. ¶¶
15-21.) The police found a commercial-grade THC extraction lab. (Snook Decl. ¶
18.) These types of illegal labs are extremely volatile due to the flammable
fuels used as solvents to strip the THC from the marijuana plants and because the
process used to burn-off the flammable solvent requires heat and pressure, when
incorrectly processed, these types of labs can cause large explosions and
fires. (Snook Decl. ¶ 9.)
 
On July 6, 2020, Plaintiff and the Property owners, Defendants
Crown and Hooper, entered into a Settlement Agreement resolving the Plaintiff’s
claims against them for the violations of the discovered marijuana operation
from April 27, 2020. (Donavanik Decl. ¶ 11.)
 
On July 30, 2020 and August 10, 2020, Code Enforcement
inspected the Property and found the Property was occupied by the business K2
Investment Group without a business license and Certificate of Occupancy.
(Donavanik Decl. ¶ 12.) On August 11, 2020, Crown received a Notice of
Violation for no Certificate of Occupancy and K2 Investment Group received a
Notice of Violation for no Certificate of Occupancy and no business license.
(Donavanik Decl. ¶ 12.)
 
On August 27, 2020, Crown and K2 Investment Group received a
citation because there was no Certificate of Occupancy issued for the Property.
(Donavanik Decl. ¶ 13.)
 
On September 16, 2020, Code Enforcement inspected the
Property and found several businesses operating at the Property. No business
license or Certificate of Occupancy was issued for the businesses. (Donavanik
Decl. ¶ 14.)
 
On February 9, 2021, Code Enforcement inspected the Property
and issued a Notice of Violation to Crown and K2 Investment Group because there
was no trash
service for the Property. (Donavanik
Decl. ¶15.)
 
On February 22, 2021, Code Enforcement inspected the
Property again, together with Hooper, and again found several businesses
operating at the Property without a business license or Certificate of
Occupancy. (Donavanik Decl. ¶ 16.)
 
On April 19, 2021, Plaintiff issued Hooper a “Notice of
Public Nuisance and Intention to Abate with City Personnel.” (UF 13; Ex. M.)
The notice was based on the existence of ongoing business operations at the
property without any permits, approvals, or inspections, as well as the
presence of elevated levels of chlorinated solvents in the soil and groundwater
beneath the Property. (Donavanik Decl. ¶ 17, Ex. M.)
 
On May 10, 2021, Code Enforcement conducted an inspection of
the Property, together with Jay Hooper, and confirmed the presence of at least
nine businesses operating without a business license and Certificate of
Occupancy. (Donavanik Decl. ¶ 18.)
 
On May 24, 2021, Plaintiff issued Hooper a “Demand for
Cessation of Illegal Activities” indicating that the Property was still not
certified for occupancy and that all unauthorized business activities on the
Property must cease. (UF 13; Donavanik Decl. ¶ 19, Ex. N.) 
 
On June 1, 2021 and August 2, 2021, Code Enforcement
conducted another inspection of the Property and confirmed the businesses were
still operating without a business license and Certificate of Occupancy.
(Donavanik Decl. ¶ 20.)
 
On August 31, 2021, Plaintiff’s peer review of the reports
by Frey Environmental, Inc. recommended that based on potential cancer risks in
some areas of the Property, a contingency plan should be implemented to
characterize potential exposure to occupants. (Donavanik Decl. ¶ 21, Ex. P.) Frey
recommended an additional 8-hour indoor and outdoor air sampling to determine
the indoor air risk. (Donavanik Decl. ¶ 21, Ex. P.) The City never received by
Crown the additional sampling requested per Frey’s recommendation. (Donavanik
Decl. ¶ 21.)
 
On August 2, 2021, the El Monte Police Department discovered
an illegal psilocybin (“Magic Mushrooms”) operation at the property. (UF 11,
see also Snook Decl. ¶¶ 22-32.) The officers responded to a trespass call and
met with Hooper, who stated that he believed the building was being used as an
illegal marijuana grow house. (Snook Decl. ¶¶ 22-23.) Hooper stated that the
locks had been changed by the suspects without permission. (Snook Decl. ¶ 23.) 
 
The officers forced entry into the Property and the locked
rooms. (Snook Decl. ¶ 24.) There, they discovered that several rooms contained
large packets of soil, seeds, and fungi that were forming that looked similar
to Magic Mushrooms. (Snook Decl. ¶ 27.) The officers discovered a number of
large pans, ovens, and packaging materials, indicating to them that a Magic
Mushroom cultivation operation was taking place. (Snook Decl. ¶ 29.) The
officers seized a total approximately 3792 pounds of mushroom spawn bags and
other items. (Snook Decl. ¶ 31.) Based on the scale of the operation, the
detective on site believed that the operation had run for a period of roughly
three months. (Snook Decl. ¶ 32.)
 
On March 9, 2022 and March 16, 2022, Code Enforcement
inspected the Property and found the Property was occupied by several
businesses without a business license and a Certificate of Occupancy.
(Donavanik Decl. ¶ 13.) Crown received a Notice of Violation. (Donavanik Decl.
¶ 23.) On March 16, 2022, Crown received a citation for no Certificate of Occupancy
and four businesses received a citation for no Certificate of Occupancy and no
business license. (Donavanik Decl. ¶ 24.)
 
On March 17, 2022, the El Monte Police Department discovered
an illegal nightclub being operated at the Property. (Snook Decl. ¶¶ 33-40.)
They raided the location and seized, inter alia, .78 grams of cocaine, 25 grams
of ketamine, 6.78 grams of methamphetamine, and 69 ecstasy pills, as well as an
additional bag each of methamphetamine, ketamine, and ecstasy. (Snook Decl. ¶
40.) The police detained 82 people and arrested one person. (Snook Decl. ¶ 11.)
 
On May 9, 2022, a receiver (the “Receiver”) was appointed to
take control of the Property. (Donavanik Decl. ¶ 29.) On May 12, 2022, a large
fire broke out at the Property. (Donavanik Decl. ¶ 29.) On May 13, 2022, the
Receiver took control of the Property. (Donavanik Decl. ¶ 29.)
 
Plaintiff filed this action on July 15, 2021. The operative
complaint is now the FAC, which raises claims for (1) public nuisance for
unpermitted construction and operation (Civ. Code, §§ 731, 3479, 3480, 3491,
3494, 3496; El Monte Municipal Code, § 1.19.020(B)(2)); (2) public nuisance for
illegal psilocybin operation (Civ. Code, §§ 3479, et seq.); (3) unpermitted
construction and operation (El Monte Municipal Code, §§ 50.04.040; 17.16.010);
(4) narcotics abatement for illegal psilocybin operation (Health & Saf.
Code, §§ 11570 et. seq.); (5) unfair competition for unpermitted construction
and operation (Bus & Prof. Code, §§ 17200, et seq.); and (6) unfair
competition for illegal psilocybin operation (Bus & Prof. Code, §§ 17200,
et seq.).
 
Plaintiff filed this motion for summary adjudication on the
first four claims on August 22, 2024. No party has filed an opposition.
 
Legal Standard
 
The purpose of a motion for
summary judgment or summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism
to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite
their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 843.) “Code of
Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to
grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences
reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences
or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and
that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) 
 
“In ruling on the motion,
the court must consider all of the evidence and all of the inferences
reasonably drawn therefrom [citation] and must view such evidence [citations]
and such inferences [citations] in the light most favorable to the opposing
party.” (Aguilar, supra, at pp. 844-845 [quotation marks
omitted].) 
 
“On a motion for summary
judgment, the initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima
facie
showing that there are no triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf v. D. B.
Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) 
 
“A plaintiff or
cross-complainant has met his or her burden of showing that there is no defense
to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the cause of
action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action. Once the
plaintiff or cross-complainant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the
defendant or cross-defendant to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto. The
defendant or cross-defendant shall not rely upon the allegations or denials of
its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists but,
instead, shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of
material fact exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 437c, subd. (p)(1).)
 
To establish a triable issue
of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.) “If the [opposing party]
cannot do so, summary judgment should be granted.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico
Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.)
 
Discussion
 
As noted above, Plaintiff seeks summary adjudication on four
causes of action.  The Court will address
them in this order:
 
Claim 3:  unpermitted
construction and operation (El Monte Municipal Code, §§ 50.04.040; 17.16.010); 
 
Claim 1:  public
nuisance for unpermitted construction and operation (Civ. Code, §§ 731, 3479,
3480, 3491, 3494, 3496; El Monte Municipal Code, § 1.19.020(B)(2)); 
 
Claim 4:  narcotics
abatement for illegal psilocybin operation (Health & Saf. Code, §§ 11570
et. seq.);
 
Claim 2: public nuisance for illegal psilocybin operation
(Civ. Code, §§ 3479, et seq.); 
 
First and Third Claims
 
Third Claim - Unpermitted Construction and Operation
 
Plaintiff raised this claim under El Monte Municipal Code,
section 17.16.010, which prohibits occupancy or use of a building unless a
certificate of occupancy is issued for that building. (El Monte Municipal Code,
§ 17.16.010.) Former section 17.16 has been amended is now section 15.09. (El
Monte Municipal Code, § 15.09.) Any person who violates El Monte Municipal
Code, Chapter 15.09 is guilty of a misdemeanor. (El Monte Municipal Code, §
15.09.090, subd. (B).) Such violations are subject to a fine not to exceed
$1,000, and each day a material violation committed shall continue a separate
offense. (El Monte Municipal Code, § 1.24.010, subd. (A).)
 
“The violation of a city ordinance may be prosecuted by city
authorities in the name of the people of the State of California, or redressed
by civil action.” (Gov. Code, § 33900, subd. (a).)
 
Violation of Los Angeles Municipal Code, section 12.21.A.1,
subd. (a), a comparable municipal code provision which prohibits the
unpermitted use of land, has been deemed a strict liability offense. (People
ex rel. Feuer v. Superior Court (Cahuenga's the Spot) (2015) 234
Cal.App.4th 1360, 1385.) “Strict liability offenses are denoted where ‘ “...
qualifying words such as knowingly, intentionally, or fraudulently are omitted
from provisions creating the offense....” ’ [Citation.]” (People v. Martin
(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 699, 713.) “Also, public welfare offenses are generally
considered to not require mens rea”. (People v. Wheeler (2023) 95
Cal.App.5th Supp. 1 [finding that ordinance regulating unlicensed commercial
storefront cannabis sales was a strict liability statute].)
 
The statute here is a land use permitting statute comparable
to LAMC section 12.21.A.1, subd. (a) and contains no terms indicating a mens
rea requirement. It is thus a strict liability statute.
 
“[W]hereas managers of limited liability companies may not
be held liable for the wrongful conduct of the companies merely because of the
managers' status, they may nonetheless be held accountable under Corporations
Code section 17158, subdivision (a) for their personal participation in
tortious or criminal conduct, even when performing their duties as manager.” (People
v. Pacific Landmark, LLC (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 1203, 1213.)
 
Here, Plaintiff has met its initial burden to show that all
elements of the claim have been met. 
Plaintiff has demonstrated that Hooper had control of the Property
through Crown. Hooper was in charge of the legal decisions regarding occupancy,
tenants, and sale. Hooper was aware of the continued illegal operation of
businesses due to both the letters issued to him and his personal presence at
some of the Code Enforcement inspections. 
 
While Crown controlled the Property, Hooper allowed
continuous commercial operation of the Property from at least July 30, 2020 to
May 12, 2022. This was in spite of the lack of a certificate of occupancy and
Plaintiff’s repeated notices and warnings to Hooper that businesses were being
illegally operated on the Property. 
 
The burden thus shifts to Hooper to show a triable issue of
fact.  Hooper has not opposed this motion
or demonstrated a triable issue as to any of those facts. Thus, there is no
triable issue that Hooper is liable for violation of section 15.09.
 
Here, the violations continued from at least July 30, 2020,
until May 12, 2022 (651 days). Thus, the maximum penalty is $651,000.00.
 
The Court grants summary adjudication on this claim.
 
First Claim - Public Nuisance for Unpermitted Construction
 
Public nuisances are “substantial and unreasonable”
“offenses against, or interferences with, the exercise of rights common to the
public.” (County of Santa Clara v.
Atlantic Richfield Co. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 292, 305.)
 
Under El Monte Municipal Code, section 8.44.030, subd. (FF),
it is a public nuisance for any person owning, leasing, occupying, or having
charge or possession of any commercial (among other purposes) premise in the city
to maintain them in a manner that violates any city or county ordinance, rule,
regulation and/or code adopted by reference of the El Monte Municipal Code, or
any violation of a state or federal law or regulation. (El Monte Municipal
Code, § 8.44.030, subd. (FF).) “The owner of any premises within the city has
the primary responsibility for keeping said premises free of public nuisances.”
(El Monte Municipal Code, § 8.44.160.)
 
The owner, the owner's agent, or any other person having
charge or control of any premises within the city, who maintains any public
nuisance as defined in Chapter 8.44, is guilty of a misdemeanor. (El Monte
Municipal Code, § 8.44.180, subd. (A).) Such violations are subject to a fine
not to exceed $1,000, and each day a material violation committed shall
continue a separate offense. (El Monte Municipal Code, § 1.24.010, subd. (A).)
 
“The violation of a city ordinance may be prosecuted by city
authorities in the name of the people of the State of California, or redressed
by civil action.” (Gov. Code, § 33900, subd. (a).)
 
As discussed above, Plaintiff has demonstrated that Hooper
controlled the Property and permitted the operation of a number of businesses
on it without an occupancy license. Because the operation of those businesses
violated the city ordinance permitting occupation without an occupancy license,
it was also a public nuisance. Thus, there is no dispute that Hooper is liable
for violation of El Monte Municipal Code, section 8.44.030, subd. (FF).
 
The burden shifts to Hooper to show a triable issue of
fact.  He has not done so.
 
Here, the violations continued from at least July 30, 2020,
until May 12, 2022 (651 days). Thus, the maximum penalty is $651,000.00.
 
The Court grants summary adjudication on this claim.
 
Second and Fourth Claims
 
Fourth Claim - Narcotics Abatement – Fourth Claim
 
“Every building or place used for the purpose of unlawfully
selling, serving, storing, keeping, manufacturing, or giving away any
controlled substance, precursor, or analog specified in this division, and
every building or place wherein or upon which those acts take place, is a
nuisance which shall be enjoined, abated, and prevented, and for which damages
may be recovered, whether it is a public or private nuisance.” (Health &
Saf. Code, § 11570.) “If there is reason to believe that a nuisance, as
described in Section 11570, is kept, maintained, or exists in any county, the
district attorney or county counsel of the county, or the city attorney of any
incorporated city or of any city and county, in the name of the people, may, …
maintain an action to abate and prevent the nuisance and to perpetually enjoin
the person conducting or maintaining it, and the owner, lessee, or agent of the
building or place in or upon which the nuisance exists from directly or
indirectly maintaining or permitting the nuisance.” (Health & Saf. Code, §
11571.) 
 
“If the existence of the nuisance is established in the
action, an order of abatement shall be entered as a part of the judgment, which
order shall direct the removal from the building or place of all fixtures,
musical instruments, and other movable property used in conducting,
maintaining, aiding, or abetting the nuisance and shall direct their sale in
the manner provided for the sale of chattels under execution.” (Health &
Saf. Code, § 11581, subd. (a).) “[T]he court may assess a civil penalty not to
exceed twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) against any or all of the
defendants, based upon the severity of the nuisance and its duration.” (Health
& Saf. Code, § 11581, subd. (b)(2).) 
 
“The order shall provide for the effectual closing of the
building or place against its use for any purpose, and for keeping it closed
for a period of one year.” (Health & Saf. Code, § 11581, subd. (b)(1).) “If
the court finds that any vacancy resulting from closure of the building or
place may create a nuisance or that closure is otherwise harmful to the
community, in lieu of ordering the building or place closed, the court may
order the person who is responsible for the existence of the nuisance, or the person
who knowingly permits controlled substances to be unlawfully sold, served,
stored, kept, or given away in or from a building or place he or she owns, to
pay damages in an amount equal to the fair market rental value of the building
or place for one year to the city or county in whose jurisdiction the nuisance
is located for the purpose of carrying out drug abuse treatment, prevention,
and education programs.” (Health & Saf. Code, § 11581, subd. (c)(1).)
 
“Nuisance abatement costs are chargeable to responsible
persons whether the city's code enforcement actions occur in the absence of
formal administrative or judicial proceedings, as well as prior to, during, or
subsequent to the initiation of such proceedings.” (El Monte Municipal Code, §
1.19.020, subd. (A).) “As used herein, ‘responsible person’ means and includes
any person that causes, creates, allows, permits, suffers, or maintains a
public nuisance to exist or continue within the city, by any act or the
omission of any act or duty, including, but not limited to, any person having
legal title to, or who leases, rents, occupies or has charge, control or
possession of, any real property in the city[.]” (El Monte Municipal Code, §
1.19.020, subd. (B).)
 
“[L]iability [under sections 11570, et seq.] attaches to a
possessor of land who ‘knows or has reason to know’ that the activity that
causes a nuisance is being carried on.” (People v. Freetown Holdings Co.
(2024) 100 Cal.App.5th 1195, 1212.) “This ‘reason to know’ standard is
recklessness, not knowledge.” (Ibid.) “ ‘A person acts recklessly with
respect to a material element of an offense when he consciously disregards a
substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will
result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that,
considering the nature and purpose of the actor’s conduct and the circumstances
known to him, its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of
conduct that a law-abiding person would observe in the actor's situation.’
[Citation.]” (Id. at pp. 1212-1213.)
 
Section 11570 makes the use a building to manufacture or
store narcotics a nuisance per se.
 
Here, Plaintiff has met its initial burden in showing that
all of the elements of the claim have been met. 
Hooper controlled the Property. It is undisputed that, although Hooper
and his property manager were present during business hours, they did not
conduct regular inspections.  It is
undisputed that the Property was, in fact, used for the production of
narcotics.
 
Hooper knew that the Property had previously been used for
illegal marijuana production, because he entered a settlement with Plaintiff
regarding those events.  Hooper met with
the police on August 2, 2021 and informed them that he believed the Property
was being used for illegal drug production – albeit the wrong drug. Although Hooper
apparently reported this conduct to the police when they arrived, the scale of
the operation indicated that it would have been going on for months. Given the
prior use of the Property for drug production, of which Hooper was aware, and
Hooper’s regular presence on the premises and failure to conduct regular
inspections, Plaintiff has demonstrated that Hooper acted in conscious
disregard of an unjustifiable risk that the Property was being used for drug
production.
 
The burden thus shifts to Hooper to show a triable issue of
fact.  He has not done so.
 
The Court therefore grants summary adjudication on this
claim.
 
Second Claim - Public Nuisance for Illegal Psilocybin Operation
 
“Anything which is injurious to health, including, but not
limited to, the illegal sale of controlled substances, or is indecent or
offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as
to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property, or unlawfully
obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable
lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin, or any public park, square,
street, or highway, is a nuisance.” (Civ. Code, § 3479.)
 
This claim appears to be duplicative of Plaintiff’s
narcotics abatement claim, which operates under the theory that the use of the
Property for psilocybin production was a nuisance. The Court is therefore inclined
to deny summary adjudication on this basis, subject to any argument as to why this
claim represents a distinct legal theory.
 
Appropriate Penalties
 
Plaintiff requests civil penalties under the first and third
claims in the amount of $651,000 and $651,000 (for a total of $1,302,000) and
under the Second and Fourth Cause of Action in the amount of $25,000. This
rewards a total civil penalty of $1,327,000.
 
Factors to consider in determining the appropriate penalty
include the sophistication and net worth of the defendant and the
proportionality to other such penalties. (City and County of San Francisco
v. Sainez (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1302, 1318.)
 
The Court therefore asks Plaintiff to direct the Court to
evidence in the record as to Hooper’s sophistication and net worth and to
address whether this is sufficient to grant summary adjudication on this issue.
