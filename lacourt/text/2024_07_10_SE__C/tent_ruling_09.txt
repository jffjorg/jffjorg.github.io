TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Plaintiffs
Tonia and Allen Flores’s motion to compel arbitration is GRANTED.
 
Moving
Party to give NOTICE.
 
 
On September 28, 2022, DOE defendants 1 through
25 allegedly collided with the vehicle driven by plaintiff Allen Burton Flores,
causing it to collide with another vehicle driven by plaintiff Tonia Andrus
Flores. DOE defendants 1 through 25 allegedly did not stop and identify
themselves. Plaintiffs submitted the claim to defendant Safeco Insurance
Company of America. 
 
Plaintiffs move to compel arbitration with
Safeco Insurance Company of America. On June 5, 2024, the Court continued the
motion to compel arbitration because Defendant filed its opposition late. 
 
Discussion
 
Insurance Code section
11580.2 requires insurers
to provide coverage for bodily injury or wrongful death caused by uninsured
motorists. Uninsured motorist coverage requires the driver to have been injured
by a vehicle with no available liability coverage, which includes when the
identity of the owner or operator of the vehicle is unknown. (Ins. Code, §
11580.2, subd. (b).) 
 
Subdivision (f) states
that if the insurer and the insured cannot agree whether the insured is legally
entitled to recover damages from an uninsured motorist and the amount of such
damages, arbitration will determine these issues. (Ins. Code, § 11580.2, subd. (f).)
 
The parties dispute
liability and nature and extent of the damages. (Opp., pg. 2.) Thus, the
parties’ dispute is subject to arbitration. 
 
Defendant states it will
participate in arbitration once discovery is complete. However, Defendant can
also conduct discovery in arbitration. 
 
Thus, the Court grants
the motion.
