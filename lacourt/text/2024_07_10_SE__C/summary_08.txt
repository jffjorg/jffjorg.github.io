Significant Statements:
  - "The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse 'after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.'" (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez)
  - "Generally, '[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.'" (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez)
```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions is granted. The defendant had argued that the plaintiff failed to obey the court's orders awarding monetary sanctions, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules. The plaintiff's responses to the defendant's discovery requests were delayed and incomplete, and the plaintiff did not oppose the defendant's discovery motions. The court has also struck the causes of action pleaded against the defendant. Because the motion for terminating sanctions was granted, the motion for judgment on the pleadings is now moot.
