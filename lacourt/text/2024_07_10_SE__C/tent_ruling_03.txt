This
is a Song-Beverly action. Plaintiff moves ex parte to set the Motion to Compel
Defendant Volkswagen Group of America, Inc.’s Responses to Plaintiffs’ First
Set of Form Interrogatories and Request for Monetary Sanctions and Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Defendant Volkswagen Group of America, Inc.’s Responses to
Plaintiff’s First Set of Special Interrogatories and Request for Monetary
Sanctions to December 10, 2024. They are currently set for January 23, 2025 and
March 25, 2025. 
 
Plaintiffs
argue judicial economy because the Court will then decide four motions on that
same day that arise out of the same facts.  Defendant argues that the
parties can informally resolve the issues if Plaintiff re-serves the
discovery.  
 
Based
on the above, the Court GRANTS the motion. The motions are ADVANCED to today
and CONTINUED to Tuesday, December 10, 2024, at 10:30 A.M. in Dept. SE-C.
 The parties are ordered to meet and confer and file a JOINT STATEMENT, no
later than 10 days before the hearing, setting forth which, if any, issues
remain unresolved and the respective position of the parties.  
 
Moving
party to give notice.
