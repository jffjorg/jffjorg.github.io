Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Christopher Lee Magdosku, has moved to set aside a default that was entered against him on March 25, 2024. The defendant claims that he was mistaken, inadvertently, or excusably neglected in not responding to the pleading on time. The Court finds that the defendant's motion is timely and that the miscalculation of the time to respond to the pleading constitutes excusable neglect. Therefore, the Court grants the motion and orders the defendant to file and serve his answer and cross-complaint within 5 days.
