Legal Standard
 
“The trial court may order a terminating
sanction for discovery abuse ‘after considering the totality of the
circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to determine if the actions were
willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the number of formal and
informal attempts to obtain the discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390.)  
 
“Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating
sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’” (Los Defensores,
supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390.) The court may impose a terminating
sanction by an order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of
any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.030, subd. (d)(1).) 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant argues that the Court may grant
terminating sanctions because Plaintiff failed to obey the Court’s March 12,
2024 and April 2, 2024 orders awarding monetary sanctions. 
 
On March 12, 2024, the Court granted
Defendant’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admissions, Set One Admitted. (Min.
Order, March 12, 2024.) The Court also awarded monetary sanctions of $1,395.00.
(Min. Order, March 12, 2024.)  On Aprill
2, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admissions, Set
Two Admitted. (Min. Order, April 2, 2024.) The Court also awarded monetary
sanctions of $1,215.00. (Min. Order, April 2, 2024.) On June 13, 2024, the
Court granted Defendant’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admissions, Set Three Admitted.
(Min. Order, June 13, 2024.) The Court also awarded monetary sanctions of
$643.65. (Min. Order, June 13, 2024.)
 
According to Defendant’s counsel, Plaintiff has
not paid sanctions as ordered by the Court on March 12, 2024 and April 2, 2024.
(Decl. Buchanan, ¶¶ 25, 27.) The Court does not know whether Plaintiff paid the
sanctions the Court ordered on Jiune 13, 2024. 
 
The Court may grant Defendant’s motion for
terminating sanctions because the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would
not produce compliance with the discovery rules. Plaintiff’s responses to Defendant’s
discovery requests were originally due in July 2023, December 2023, and May
2024. (Min. Order, March 12, 2024, April 2, 2024, and June 13, 2024.) Plaintiff did
not respond to Defendant’s requests and did not oppose the three discovery
motions. (Min. Order, March 12, 2024, April 2, 2024, and June
13, 2024.) Plaintiff also did not oppose the instant motion. It appears Plaintiff
is no longer interested in litigating this matter.
 
Defendant’s motion
for terminating sanctions is GRANTED.  The
causes of action pleaded against it are stricken. 
 
Because the court
granted the motion for terminating sanctions, the motion for judgment on the
pleadings is MOOT.
