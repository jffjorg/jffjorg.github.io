TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Plaintiff
Maria Avina Jacobo and Alfredo Lopez Gomez’s motion to compel the deposition of
American Honda Motor Company, Inc.’s Person Most Qualified is GRANTED. No
sanctions are awarded. 
 
Moving
Party to give NOTICE.
 
 
This is a Song-Beverly action. Plaintiff Marina Avina Jacobo and Alfredo Lopez Gomez move to compel Defendant’s
Person Most Qualified (PMQ) deposition according to Code of Civil Procedure section
2025.450.  
 
Discussion
 
If
a party or an officer, director, managing agent, or
employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a
party under Section 2025.230 does not appear for deposition after service of a
deposition notice and the party has not validly objected, the noticing party
may move to compel the deponent’s attendance and testimony. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (a).)  
 
Article 2, commencing with Section 2025.210, sets forth
the grounds for objection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410, subd.
(a).) A party served with a deposition notice waives any error or irregularity
unless that party serves a written objection specifying that error or
irregularity at least three calendar days before the deposition. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.410, subd. (a).) 
 
On February 8,
2024, Plaintiffs noticed the deposition of Defendant’s person most qualified. (Lupinek
Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A.) 
 
On March 1,
2024, Defendant objected to the requests for documents accompanying the
deposition notice and offered July 22, 2024 as an alternative date. (Dowling
Decl., ¶ 7, Ex. C.)  
 
On March 11,
2024, Plaintiff declined the proposed July 22, 2024 date.  Plaintiff requested an earlier date because
trial is scheduled for August 27, 2024. (Dowling Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. G.)
 
Based on the
above, the motion is GRANTED. The deposition is ordered for July 22, 2024. The
parties are not foreclosed from seeking a trial continuance in Dept. SE-F. 
 
Sanctions
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section¿2025.450(c)
further provides, “(1) If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court
shall impose a monetary sanction . . . in favor of the party who noticed the
deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated,
unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450(c).) 
 
In its
discretion, the Court does not award sanctions.
