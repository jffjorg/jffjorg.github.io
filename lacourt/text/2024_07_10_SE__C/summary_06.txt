And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted defendant Hyundai Motor America's motion to compel arbitration in this Song-Beverly consumer warranty act case. The judge found that the plaintiff's claims arise from defendant's statutory obligations and are not based on any express contractual language, and therefore, equitable estoppel does not apply. The judge also found that the arbitration clause in the warranty agreement is not unconscionable. The judge chose to follow the reasoning in Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, which disagreed with Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486, and held that the manufacturer cannot compel arbitration where the claims do not arise from the sale contract.
