Moving Party to give NOTICE. 
 
 
This is a dispute between family members over
ownership of real property located at 9800 San Carlos Avenue, Units A, B, and
C, in South Gate, California 90280. The parties are siblings. Plaintiffs
Enrique Betancourt, Jr. and Maria Betancourt sue for the following: (1)
resulting trust; (2) constructive trust; (3) breach of fiduciary duty; (4)
quiet title; and (5) accounting. 
 
On July 11, 2023, the parties participated in
a mandatory settlement conference. They did not settle the case. 
 
Defendant Angel Betancourt moves for monetary
and non-monetary sanctions against plaintiffs Maria Betancourt and Enrique
Betancourt, Jr. based on disobeying the Court’s October 12, 2023 discovery
order. 
 
Legal Standard
 
“The trial court may order a terminating
sanction for discovery abuse ‘after considering the totality of the circumstances:
[the] conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful; the
detriment to the propounding party; and the number of formal and informal
attempts to obtain the discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390.)  
 
The following factors may also be relevant: (1)
the time which has elapsed since written discovery was served; (2) whether the
party served was previously given a voluntary extension of time; (3) the number
of discovery requests propounded; (4) whether the unanswered questions sought
information which was difficult to obtain; (5) whether the answers supplied
were evasive and incomplete; (6) the number of questions which remained
unanswered; (7) whether the questions which remain unanswered are material to a
particular claim or defense; (8) whether the answering party has acted in good
faith, and with reasonable diligence; (9) the existence of prior orders
compelling discovery and the answering party's response thereto; (10) whether
the party was unable to comply with the previous order of the court; (11)
whether an order allowing more time to answer would enable the answering party
to supply the necessary information, and; (12) whether a sanction short of
dismissal or default would be appropriate to the dereliction. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 796–97.)
 
“Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating
sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’” (Los Defensores,
supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390.) The court may impose a terminating
sanction by an order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of
any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.030, subd. (d)(1).) 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant argues that the Court may grant
terminating sanctions because Plaintiffs failed to obey the Court’s October 12,
2023 order compelling discovery responses. 
 
On October 12, 2023, the Court granted Defendants’
motions to compel Plaintiffs’ responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One and Special
Interrogatories, Set Two. The Court also issued monetary sanctions of $1,475.00.
According to Defendant’s counsel, Plaintiff has not responded to discovery to
date or paid sanctions. (Decl. Lanphere, ¶ 6.) 
 
Plaintiff Maria Betancourt filed a declaration
in opposition. She stated that given the financial condition she and her
brother were in, she could no longer afford legal representation. (Decl.
Betancourt, ¶ 8.) She said she tried to get her case file from her former
counsel from December 8, 2023 to May 2024. (Decl. Betancourt, ¶ 11.) She also
said that “Attorney Santana” told her that Attorney Mojarro stated that he had
no notice of the October 12, 2023, sanctions. (Decl. Betancourt, ¶ 15.) She
further states that “Attorney Santana” will request the file from Attorney
Mojarro and upon receipt, she will be able to address the issues raised by the
October 12, 2023 order. (Decl. Betancourt, ¶ 19.) 
 
Plaintiff Enrique Betancourt, Jr. has not
opposed the instant motion. 
 
Defendant’s responses to Plaintiff’s discovery requests were originally
due in September 2022 and November 2022. (Decl. Lanphere, ¶¶ 13, 14.) Defendants
have now delayed responding to Plaintiff’s discovery requests for 22
months.  Defendants did
not respond to Plaintiff’s request and did not oppose the May 2023 discovery
motions. Further, Defendants’ counsel granted multiple extensions at Plaintiffs’
request. (Decl. Lanphere, ¶¶ 18, 21.) Further, “Attorney
Santana” has not substituted in as counsel for Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs became
pro per litigants in December 2023, and it is unclear if they will obtain their
case file from their former counsel and continue litigating. The Court is
inclined to issue terminating sanctions. 
Defendant should not have to defend a lawsuit which has remained dormant
for as long as this one has, without just cause.  
 
Defendant Angel Betancourt’s motion for terminating sanctions is GRANTED.  The order is STAYED until a hearing scheduled
for September 11, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C.  If Plaintiffs do not respond to Defendant’s Form
Interrogatories (Set One) and Special Interrogatories (Set Two) by the hearing
date, or show good cause why responses have not been produced, the stay will be
lifted and terminating sanctions will be ordered.
