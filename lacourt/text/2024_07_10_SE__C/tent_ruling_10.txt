Moving
Party to give NOTICE.
 
 
This
is an action for quiet title based on adverse possession. 
 
On
March 25, 2024, default was entered against defendant Christopher Lee Magdosku.
 
 
Defendant
seeks to set aside default based upon mistake, inadvertence or excusable
neglect under CCP § 473, subd. (b). 
 
No
opposition has been filed as of July 8, 2024.
 
Discussion
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (b) states: 
 
The court may, upon any
terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy
of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the
application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable
time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken.  
 
The
purpose of mandatory relief is to alleviate the hardship on parties who lose
their day in court due to an inexcusable failure to act by their attorneys. (Rodriguez v. Brill
(2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 715, 723.) “Section 473 is often applied liberally where
the party in default moves promptly to seek relief, and the party opposing the
motion will not suffer prejudice if relief is granted. [Citations.] In such
situations ‘very slight evidence will be required to justify a court in setting
aside the default.’ [Citations.] [¶] Moreover, because the law strongly favors
trial and disposition on the merits, any doubts in applying section 473 must be
resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from default.” (Fasuyi v.
Permatex, Inc. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 681, 695.)
 
Here, default was entered on March 25, 2024,
and Defendant filed the instant motion on April 19, 2024, within the six-month time
specified in CCP § 473.  Hence, the
motion is timely.  
 
Defendant’s attorney states that he
miscalculated the time to respond to the pleading. (Decl. Pena, ¶ 3.) This is inadvertence
and excusable neglect. 
 
Defendant included a copy of the answer and
cross-complaint. 
 
The Court will not adjudicate Defendant’s
requests for judicial notice because they are not material to the determination
of the instant motion. 
 
Hence, the Court GRANTS the motion. The Answer and
Cross-Complaint attached to the motion is not deemed filed as of this
date.  Defendant is ordered to file and
serve their Answer and Cross-Complaint within 5 days.
