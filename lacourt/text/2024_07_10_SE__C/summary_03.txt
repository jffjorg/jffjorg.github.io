And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in the case of Rios vs. Mesa Imports, LLC. The plaintiff has moved to set a hearing on motions to compel responses from the defendant, Volkswagen Group of America, Inc., and to request monetary sanctions. The motions are currently set for January 23, 2025, and March 25, 2025, but the plaintiff argues that it would be more efficient to hear all four motions together, as they arise from the same facts. The defendant suggests that the parties could resolve the issues informally if the plaintiff re-serves the discovery. The judge has granted the motion, advancing the hearing to December 10, 2024, and ordering the parties to meet and confer and file a joint statement 10 days before the hearing. The parties are also ordered to give notice.
