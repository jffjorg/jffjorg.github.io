Significant Statements:
  - "Generally, '[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.'"
  - "Defendant should not have to defend a lawsuit which has remained dormant for as long as this one has, without just cause."
```

Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with a discovery order. The plaintiff failed to respond to discovery requests, despite being granted multiple extensions, and the defendant has delayed responding to plaintiff's discovery requests for 22 months. The judge is inclined to issue terminating sanctions, which would strike out the pleadings of the non-complying party. The order is stayed until a hearing on September 11, 2024, at which point the stay will be lifted and terminating sanctions will be ordered if the plaintiff fails to respond to discovery requests or show good cause for non-compliance.
