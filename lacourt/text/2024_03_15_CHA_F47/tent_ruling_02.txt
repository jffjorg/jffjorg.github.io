Case #23CHCV03037
 
DEMURRER TO THE
ORIGINAL ANSWER
 
Demurrer filed on 1/16/24.
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Lenekia Lung
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Kamal McBride-Wilson
NOTICE: ok
 
Demurrer is to the 20 affirmative defenses asserted in
Defendant Kamal McBride-Wilson’s Answer to Plaintiff Lenekia Lung’s
complaint.    
 
RULING: The demurrer is overruled.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a motor vehicle collision that
occurred on 11/14/22.  On 10/10/23,
Plaintiff Lenekia Lung (Plaintiff) filed this action against Defendant Kamal
McBride-Wilson (Defendant) for: (1) motor vehicle and (2) general
negligence.  On 1/5/24, Defendant filed
an answer to the complaint asserting 20 affirmative defenses.
 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the
issues Plaintiff had with the answer, on 1/16/24, Plaintiff filed and served
the instant demurrer to each of the affirmative defenses in Defendant’s answer
on the grounds that the defenses do not state facts sufficient to constitute a
defense, are improperly pleaded and/or are uncertain.  CCP 430.20(a), (b).  On 2/29/24, Defendant filed an opposition to
the demurrer.  Defendant contends that
Plaintiff’s efforts to meet and confer before filing the demurrer were not made
in good faith and, therefore, the demurrer should be overruled.  However, failure to meet and confer is not
grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer. 
See CCP 430.41(a)(4). 
Therefore, the Court will address the merits of the demurrer.   
 
ANALYSIS
 
Pleadings are to be liberally construed with a view
toward substantial justice between the parties. CCP 452.  The Court finds that Defendant’s answer
provides Plaintiff with sufficient notice so that Plaintiff may prepare the case
and any defects in the answer do not affect Plaintiff’s substantial
rights.  See Harris (2013)
56 C4th 203, 239-240; FPI Development, Inc. (1991) 231 CA3d 367,
384-385.  Any uncertainties regarding the
affirmative defenses can be resolved through discovery.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer is overruled.
