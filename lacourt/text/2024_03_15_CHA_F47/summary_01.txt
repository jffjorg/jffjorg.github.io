And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied a motion to set aside defaults filed by the defendants, Everardo Vargas Valencia, Esq., Everardo Vargas Valencia, A.P.C., and Law Offices of Everardo Vargas Valencia, APC. The motion was filed on January 9, 2024, seeking relief under California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) based on attorney fault. The court found that the defaults were the result of the defendants' own fault, rather than the attorney's fault, and therefore, the mandatory relief provision of CCP 473(b) did not apply. The court also found that the defendants did not act diligently after learning of the defaults and did not file the motion until more than four months later, which was untimely.
