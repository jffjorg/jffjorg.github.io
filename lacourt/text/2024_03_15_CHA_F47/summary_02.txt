And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case regarding a demurrer filed by the plaintiff, Lenekia Lung, against the defendant, Kamal McBride-Wilson. The demurrer challenges the defendant's 20 affirmative defenses asserted in their answer to the complaint. The judge has reviewed the pleadings and finds that the defendant's answer provides sufficient notice to the plaintiff, and any defects in the answer do not affect the plaintiff's substantial rights. The judge also notes that any uncertainties regarding the affirmative defenses can be resolved through discovery. Therefore, the demurrer is overruled. The hearing date is March 15, 2024.
