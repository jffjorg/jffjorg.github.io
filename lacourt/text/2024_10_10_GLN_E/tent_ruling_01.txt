RELIEF REQUESTED¿ 
“Plaintiff, Ali Ahmad, an individual ("Plaintiff") will, and hereby
does, move this Court for an order: 1) compelling Defendant, Veracor Financial,
LLC, a Georgia limited liability company ("Defendant") to provide
verified responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, without objection, within
five (5) calendar days from the date of the hearing and (2) for an order
imposing monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,068.95 against Defendant and
its attorney of record, Michael Plotkin, Esq., jointly and severally, for their
willful failure to comply with discovery forcing this Motion. This amount is a
fair reimbursement of attorney's fees and costs incurred by Plaintiff as a
result of being forced to bring this Motion. 
 
This Motion is based on the grounds
that Defendant failed to respond in any way, to Plaintiff Form Interrogatories,
Set One, and while meeting and conferring is not required since there was a
complete abject failure to respond, Counsel for Defendant failed to
meaningfully respond to Counsel for Plaintiff meaningful efforts to obtain the
responses without need for a Motion, even after Counsel for Defendant, Michael
Plotkin, Esq. agreed to serve responses without objection. This Motion is based
upon this Notice, the attached Memorandum of Points and Authorities, the
Declaration of Jessica N. Frey, Esq., any matters subject to judicial notice,
and the court records filed in this action.”
 
(Pl. Mot. p. 1-2.)
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff, Ali Ahmad, filed the
instant action on 9/1/2023 against Defendants – (1) Kenton Gray, an individual,
(2) Damayanti K. Lam AKA Krystine D. Lam, an individual, (3) Veracor Financial,
LLC, a Georgia limited liability company, and (4) Does 1-50 inclusive.
The
Complaint alleges five causes of action: (1) Fraud: False Promise, (2)
Fraudulent Inducement, (3) Express Indemnity, (4) Negligent Misrepresentation,
and (5) Violations of Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200.
Defendant,
Veracor Financial, LLC filed an Answer on 11/13/2023.
Plaintiff
now moves to compel responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, from Defendant,
Veracor Financial, LLC. Plaintiff also now moves for sanctions against
Defendant and its attorney of record.
LEGAL STANDARD –
COMPEL RESPONSES, INTERROGATORIES
Within 30 days after service of interrogatories, the party to whom the
interrogatories are propounded shall serve the original of the response to them
on the propounding party, unless on motion of the propounding party the court
has shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the responding
party the court has extended the time for response. (CCP § 2030.260(a).)
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the party propounding the interrogatories may move
for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (CCP § 2030.290(b).)
“The party to whom the interrogatories are directed
waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section
2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based
on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing
with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this
waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are
satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial
compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. (2) The
party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 2030.290(a).)
Unlike a motion to compel further responses, a motion
to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding
party does not have to demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a
“meet and confer” requirement. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404
citing Weil and Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The
Rutter Group 2006) ¶¶8:1137 to 8:1144, pp. 8F-59 to 8F-60, ¶¶ 8:1483 to 8:1489,
pp. 8H-29 to hH-30 (Weil & Brown).)
ANALYSIS
On
November 28, 2023, Plaintiff served Form Interrogatories, Set One, on Defendant,
Veracor Financial, LLC. (Frey Decl. ¶ 10.) Plaintiff argues that verified
responses were due on January 2, 2024. 
Plaintiff’s counsel, Jessica N. Frey, signed the
declaration attached to this motion on August 31, 2024, and as of that date,
Frey stated that no responses have ever been received and that there has been
no request for an extension. (Frey Decl. ¶¶ 12-13.)
Here, since responses have not been timely provided,
Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses should be granted. Further, the Court
notes that no Opposition was filed.
TENTATIVE RULING 
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel verified responses from Defendant, Veracor Financial, LLC, re:
Form Interrogatories, Set One, is GRANTED. Defendant is ordered to provide
verified responses within five calendar days from the date of this hearing. 

Sanctions
Plaintiff requests an order imposing monetary sanctions in the amount of
$1,068.95 against Defendant and its attorney of record, Michael Plotkin, Esq.
CCP § 2030.290 states in relevant part:
The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(CCP § 2030.290(c).)
 
“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act
in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
Plaintiff’s
counsel states her reasonable hourly attorney fee based on the Laffey United
States Attorney’s Office Attorney’s Fee Matrix from 6/1/23 – 5/31/24 is $777.00
per hour.
Frey states she
spent: (1) Two hours preparing this motion; (2) One hour will be spent
reviewing any opposition/preparing a reply/notice of non-opposition, (3) One
hour attending the hearing on the motion, (4) $60.00 for the filing fee, and
(5) $8.95 incurred to mail the moving papers with tracking to Defendant’s
counsel.
 
The Court will
hear argument. The Court is curious as to why Plaintiff’s counsel includes the
reasonable hourly fee based on the Laffey Matrix. It seems as if it would be
more relevant to know how much Plaintiff’s counsel is actually charging the
client. Further, the Court notes that there was no Opposition to review, so
Plaintiff’s counsel should not be awarded time for reviewing an Opposition.
However, the Court does note that a notice of non-opposition was filed by
Plaintiff as the Reply.
