Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel verified responses from the defendant, Veracor Financial, LLC, regarding Form Interrogatories, Set One. The defendant is ordered to provide verified responses within five calendar days from the date of the hearing. Additionally, the judge has ordered that the defendant and its attorney, Michael Plotkin, shall pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,068.95 to the plaintiff for their willful failure to comply with discovery. The judge notes that the defendant failed to respond to the interrogatories and that there was no opposition to the motion. The judge also questions the reasonableness of the plaintiff's counsel's hourly fee, which is based on the Laffey United States Attorney's Office Attorney's Fee Matrix.
