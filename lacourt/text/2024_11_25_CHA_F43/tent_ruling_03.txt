SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
May 14, 2024, defendant Sergey Pogosyan served plaintiff Leonard Allen Cole
with Requests for Production, Set One. Cole’s responses were due on June 17,
2024.  On June 14, 2024, Cole requested a
30-day extension to July 15, 2024, which Pogosyan granted. On July 15, 2024,
Cole requested another 30-day extension to August 14, 2024, which Pogosyan again
granted.  On August 14, 2024, Cole’s
counsel emailed Pogosyan’s counsel requesting an extension to August 30, 2024.  Cole’s counsel had just returned to the office
from being out three weeks due to COVID-19.  Pogosyan’s counsel granted the extension.  Cole has yet to serve responses. 
 
Pogosyan
filed this motion on October 8, 2024 and argues that the Court should compel
Cole’s responses because Cole received three extensions, Cole has not served
responses, and the information Pogosyan seeks is relevant to the resolution of
this case. 
 
Pogosyan
seeks $1,320.00 in sanctions against Cole and his counsel.
 
Cole
does not oppose this motion.
 
ANALYSIS
A
propounding party may move to compel responses to requests for production where
the responding party fails to provide any responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b).)  The propounding party must show the requests
were properly served, that the time to respond expired, and no response has
been served.  (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403-404.)  The responding party must serve responses
within 45 days after the requests for production are served or according to an
agreed upon deadline extension.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c); Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1490-1410.)  Failing to
respond within these time limits waives objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).)  
 
Here,
Cole did not comply with the three extensions Pogosyan granted and has yet to
serve any responses.
Accordingly, Cole must
provide code-compliant, objection-free responses to each individual request for
production.
 
Sanctions
The Court must issue sanctions against any party who “unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for
inspection . . . unless, it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
Pogosyan requests sanctions in the amount of
$1,320.00 against Cole and Cole’s counsel. Pogosyan’s counsel charges an hourly
rate of $240.00.  (Declaration of Tyler
M. Ross, ¶ 8.)   The request includes the following: (1) 2.5
hours preparing this motion and another motion to compel responses ($600.00);
(2) 1 hour drafting reply briefs ($240.00); and (3) 2 hours preparing for and
attending the hearing on the motions ($480.00).  (Ibid.) 
 
The Court finds the hourly rate reasonable, but the
time spent on this motion is unreasonable.  No reply brief was filed, this motion is
virtually identical to a separate discovery motion Pogosyan filed, and the
issues are not complex. 
 
Accordingly, the Court grants Pogosyan’s request in
the reduced amount of $360.00: (1) 1 hour preparing this motion; and (2) 0.5
hours for hearing prep and attending the hearing.

3.

record are ordered to pay sanctions in total amount of $360.00.  Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel are ordered
to pay these sanctions to Defendant’s counsel within twenty (20) days.
