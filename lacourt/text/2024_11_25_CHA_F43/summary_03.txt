And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a motion filed by defendant Sergey Pogosyan to compel plaintiff Leonard Allen Cole to respond to requests for production, set one. The requests were served on May 14, 2024, and Cole has yet to serve a response despite being granted three extensions. The judge has ordered Cole to serve code-compliant, objection-free responses to each individual request for production within 20 days.

Additionally, the judge has granted Pogosyan's request for sanctions against Cole and his counsel in the amount of $360.00. The sanctions are for Pogosyan's counsel's time spent on the motion, including preparing the motion and attending a hearing. The judge found that the hourly rate charged by Pogosyan's counsel was reasonable, but the time spent on the motion was unreasonable.

The judge has ordered Cole and his counsel to pay the sanctions to Pogosyan's counsel within 20 days.
