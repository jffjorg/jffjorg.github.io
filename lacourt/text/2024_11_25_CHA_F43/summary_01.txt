And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by the defendants, Cass Enterprises, Inc., et al., without prejudice. The motion was filed to determine whether the settlement reached between the parties was made in good faith. The settlement was reached in exchange for the defendants' insurers' agreement to pay all available remaining policy limits. The judge found that the declaration submitted by the defendants' counsel, Luke Wagner, was deficient because it only stated the settlement amount and the steps leading to the settlement amount, and did not provide sufficient information to allow the court to assess whether the settlement was made in good faith. The judge noted that the court must be able to assess whether the settlement amount is within the reasonable range of the settling tortfeasor's proportional share of comparative liability for the plaintiff's injuries, and that the declaration did not allow for this assessment.
