And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on the demurrer to the cross-complaint and the motion to strike portions of the cross-complaint to March 4, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. The demurrer and motion to strike are not accompanied by meet and confer declarations as required by Code of Civil Procedure § 430.41 and § 435.5. Therefore, counsel for Manking, Chung Chin Tsai, and Kenny Tsai must file declarations in compliance with these sections at least nine court days prior to the continued hearing date. The court will not consider the demurrer and motion to strike until these deficiencies are corrected.
