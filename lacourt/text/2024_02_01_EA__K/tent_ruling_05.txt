Discussion
Plaintiff applies for a right to attach order and writ of
attachment against J&M. The amount to be secured by the attachment is $83,675.38,
which includes estimated costs of $600.00 and estimated allowable attorney fees
of $1,200.00.
Analysis
“Attachment is a prejudgment remedy which requires a court
to make a preliminary determination of the merits of a dispute. It allows a
creditor who has applied for an attachment following the statutory guidelines
and established a prima facie claim to have a debtor's assets seized and held
until final adjudication at trial.” (Lorber
Industries, Inc. v. Turbulence, Inc. (1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 532, 535.) “A
purpose of the attachment statutes is to confine attachments to commercial
situations and to prohibit them in consumer transactions. The language, ‘trade,
business or profession,’ in section 483.010, subdivision (c) fulfills that
purpose by limiting the use of attachments to ‘commercial transactions’ and
precluding them in ‘consumer transactions.’” (Kadison, Phaelzer, Woodard, Quinn
& Rossi v. Wilson (1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 [citation omitted].)
Attachment is
governed by Attachment Law, Title 6.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, sections
481.010-493.060. “[A]ttachment procedures are solely creatures of
statute and . . . such statutes must be strictly construed.” (Arcata Publications Group v. Beverly Hills
Publishing Co. (1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 276, 279.)
Procedural Considerations: “Upon the filing of the complaint or
at any time thereafter, the plaintiff may apply…for a right to attach order and
a writ of attachment by filing an application for the order and writ with the
court in which the action is brought.”
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 484.010, 485.210, subd. (a).) “No order or writ shall be
issued. . . except after a hearing. At the times prescribed by subdivision (b)
of Section 1005, the defendant shall be served with all of the following:
(a) A copy of the summons and complaint. (b) A notice of application and
hearing. (c) A copy of the application and of any affidavit in support of the
application.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
484.040.)
The court cannot determine whether or not adequate notice of
the instant application has been provided, inasmuch as Plaintiff has failed to
file any proof of service whatsoever in this action, to date (i.e., as of
January 30, 2024, 12:00 p.m.) The application is denied without prejudice
on this basis.[2]
