And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is issuing a tentative ruling on the demurrer/strike motion filed by the demurring party. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §§ 430.41 and 435.5, the parties are required to meet and confer before filing such motions. The demurring party has met and conferred with the party who filed the pleading, but they were unable to reach an agreement resolving the objections raised in the demurrer/strike.

The court finds that the demurring party has complied with the meet and confer requirement, and the party who filed the pleading has failed to respond to the meet and confer request or otherwise failed to meet and confer in good faith. Therefore, the court will grant the demurrer/strike and give the party who filed the pleading an opportunity to amend the pleading to cure any legal insufficiencies.

The court sets a hearing on the amended pleading for [Insert Date of Hearing]. The parties are ordered to meet and confer again before the hearing date to determine whether an agreement can be reached that resolves the objections to the amended pleading. If the parties are unable to reach an agreement, the demurring party may file a second demurrer/strike motion.
