Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses two motions for summary judgment filed by defendants Adrian Salazar and Reina Guevara, and BJ's Restaurants, Inc. The Judge notes that Plaintiffs' counsel has failed to provide a sufficient Separate Statement in opposition to the motions, citing several deficiencies in the document. The Judge will continue the hearing on March 13, 2024 to permit Plaintiffs' counsel to address these deficiencies. The Judge also denies a request for a continuance, stating that Plaintiffs have had ample time to procure discovery. Additionally, the Judge notes that the motions for summary judgment will be heard together, and will not be bifurcated.
