Background   
Plaintiff Manking ELS, LLC (“Manking”) alleges as follows:
On May 19, 2017, Manking entered into a
Commercial Lease Agreement (“CLA”) with Enhancer Elsinore, LLC (Enhancer”),
Esther Lin (“Lin”) and Walter Lynn (“Lynn”) (collectively, “Defendants”)
pertaining to the Elsinore Hot Springs Motel (“Property”). The CLA, which was
to be effective on June 16, 2017, called for a three-year lease term. At
Defendants’ request, the parties on June 16, 2017 signed an Addendum, extending
the lease from July 16, 2017 to such date at which inspections pass to qualify
the Property for an occupancy permit. At the same time the parties executed the
CLA, Defendants drafted a Hotel Management Agreement (“HMA”), which the parties
entered into on June 16, 2017. Defendants failed to pay rent and failed to
manage and maintain the Property. 
On November 12, 2021, Manking filed a Second Amended Complaint, asserting
causes of action against Defendants and Does 1-10 for:
1.

Kenny Tsai (“K. Tsai”) and Roes 1-50 for:

The Final Status Conference is set for March 4, 2024. Trial is set for

1.         Demurrer
Manking, C. Tsai and K. Tsai demur,
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 430.10, subdivisions (e) and (f), to the
first through sixth causes of action in the cross-complaint on the basis that
they each fail to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action and are
uncertain.
The hearing on the demurrer will be continued to March 4,
2024 at 10:00 a.m.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
128; 430.41[1].)
Code of Civil Procedure § 430.41 requires a demurring party in certain civil
actions, before filing the demurrer, to engage in a specified meet and confer
process with the party who filed the pleading demurred to for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached as to the filing of an amended
pleading that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.
The instant demurrer is not accompanied by a Code of Civil
Procedure § 430.41 meet and confer declaration. Cross-Complainants, moreover,
mention that demurring cross-defendants have “skirt[ed] the requirement to meet
and confer . . .” (Opp., 2:8-10).
Counsel for Manking, C. Tsai and K. Tsai must file a
declaration in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure § 430.41 at least nine
court days prior to the continued hearing date. 
Counsel for Manking, C. Tsai and K. Tsai is ordered to give
notice.
2.         Motion to Strike
Manking, C. Tsai and K. Tsai move
to strike out the following portions of the cross-complaint:
1.                 
Page 11, ¶ 62;
2.                 
Pages 12-13, ¶ 75; and
3.                 
Page 16, ¶ 2.
The hearing on the motion to strike will be continued to March
4, 2024 at 10:00 a.m.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 128; 435.5[2]).
Code of Civil Procedure § 435.5 requires a party in certain
civil actions, before filing a motion to strike, to engage in a specified meet
and confer process with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to the
motion to strike for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be
reached as to the filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the motion to strike.
The instant motion to strike is not accompanied by a Code of
Civil Procedure § 435.5 meet and confer declaration.
The court will continue the hearing to March 4, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. based upon the above deficiency. Counsel for
Manking, C. Tsai and K. Tsai must file a declaration in compliance with Code of
Civil Procedure § 435.5 at least nine court days prior to the continued hearing
date. 
Counsel for Manking, C. Tsai and K. Tsai is ordered to give
notice.
