And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff, Haaker Equipment Company, has applied for a Right to Attach Order and Order for Issuance of Writ of Attachment against the defendant, J&M Contracting Corp. The plaintiff alleges that J&M has defaulted on four separate rental agreements and seeks to attach J&M's assets to secure payment of debts. However, the court finds that the plaintiff has failed to provide adequate notice of the application, as there is no proof of service filed in the action to date. Therefore, the application is denied without prejudice on this basis.
