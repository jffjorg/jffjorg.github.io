 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205  LEO DAVID,    Plaintiff, v.  AURICE VELOSO,   Defendant.    Case No.:  22SMCV01934     Hearing Date:  September 27, 2023   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   DEFENDANT AURICE VELOSO’S    MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER     AURICE VELOSO,    Cross-Complainant, v.  LEO DAVID, et al.,   Defendants.          MOVING PARTY:  Plaintiff Leo David  RESPONDING PARTY:  Defendant Aurice Veloso   BACKGROUND  This case arises from an employment dispute.  Defendant Aurice Veloso was a caregiver for Plaintiff Leo David and his late wife, Ruth David.  (Compl. ¶¶ 7-8.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendant stole monies and personal property and engaged in financial and physical elder abuse.  (Id. ¶¶ 11-30.)   The operative complaint alleges eleven claims for: (1) Elder Abuse; (2) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (3) Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress; (4) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (5) Promissory Estoppel; (6) Breach of Oral Agreement; (7) Fraud; (8) Conversion; (9) Trespass to Chattel; (10) Defamation: Slander (Cal. Civ. Code § 46); and (11) Unjust Enrichment. This hearing is on Defendant’s motion for protective order and for sanctions.  Plaintiff served 88 requests for admissions (“RFAs”) and 224 special interrogatories (“SROGS”).  Defendant seeks an order (1) finding that the number of RFAs and SROGS propounded by Plaintiff is excessive and unwarranted, (2) requiring Defendant to respond to only 35 RFAs and 35 SROGs, (3) prohibiting Plaintiff from requesting confidential income and tax return information from Defendant, and (4) for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel in the sum of $1,552.50. LEGAL STANDARD Defendant moves for a protective order pursuant to CCP §§ 2033.080 and 2030.090 to protect her from any further unwarranted annoyance, oppression, undue burden and expense caused by Plaintiff’s alleged misuse of the discovery process. CCP § 2033.080 provides in part: “(a) When requests for admission have been made, the responding party may promptly move for a protective order. This motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040. (b) The court, for good cause shown, may make any order that justice requires to protect any party from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden and expense. This protective order may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following directions: (1) That the set of admission requests, or particular requests in the set, need not be answered at all.” CCP § 2030.090 provides: “(a) When interrogatories have been propounded, the responding party, and any other party or affected natural person or organization may promptly move for a protective order. This motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040. (b) The court, for good cause shown, may make any order that justice requires to protect any party or other natural person or organization from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense. This protective order may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following directions: (1) That the set of interrogatories, or particular interrogatories in the set, need not be answered.” Moving parties have the burden to show good cause for a protective order. (Emerson Elec. Co. v. Sup. Ct. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 1101, 1110.)  To prevail on motions for protective orders, moving parties have the burden “to demonstrate that the ‘discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive’…, or that the ‘selected method of discovery is unduly burdensome or expensive’….” (Sinaiko, 148 Cal.App.4th at 402.) However, pursuant to CCP § 2033.040(b), “If the responding party seeks a protective order on the ground that the number of requests for admission is unwarranted, the propounding party shall have the burden of justifying the number of requests for admission.”  Similarly, if the number of SROGs exceeds that permitted by the Discovery Act and the responding party moves for a protective order, the¿propounding party has the burden of justifying the number of SROGs. (See¿Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.040 subd. (d).)  Therefore, Plaintiff has the burden to justify why 88 RFAs and 224 SROGs are warranted.   The decision upon whether to enter a protective order lies within the sound discretion of the court.  (Raymond Handling Concepts Corp. v. Sup. Ct. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 584, 588, 591; Meritplan Ins. Co. v. Sup. Ct. (1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 237, 242.)  For good cause shown, courts may make any order that justice requires to protect a party from unwarranted annoyances, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden and expense.  (Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. Sup. Ct. (1991) 233 Cal. App. 3d 1138, 1141.)  The protective order may include an order that the RFAs or SROGs need not be answered, or that the responses be made only on specified terms and conditions.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.090(b)(1), (4); 2033.080(b)(1), (2).) MEET AND CONFER A motion for a protective order “shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2019.030(b); see also Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 402 (“The responding party must also demonstrate that it made ‘a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented’ by the motion for a protective order.”).) Here, defense counsel’s declaration states that the discovery at issue was propounded on March 20, 2023.  On August 25, 2023, defense counsel wrote to Plaintiff’s counsel stating that she would respond to only 40 RFAs and 40 SROGS.  The letter also raised privilege concerns as to discovery relating to Plaintiff’s tax information.  The court finds that defense counsel’s letter requesting that Plaintiff withdraw the excess RFAs and SROGs, and her notice to Defendant that if no response was received, she would file a motion for a protective order and seek sanctions is sufficient to comply with the meet and confer requirements of CCP § 2016.040. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE Defendant requests judicial notice of various motions and pleadings filed in this action and the related case, Aurice Veloso v. Leo David, et al., Case No. 22STCV35085.  The Court grants the request pursuant to Evid. Code §§ 452(d) and 453. ANALYSIS A motion for a protective order should be “promptly” made, normally within the 30-day period for responding to the discovery request or within the period of the stipulated extension.  (See Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.090(a) (interrogatories), 2031.060(a) (document requests), 2033.080(a) (requests for admissions), Willis v. Superior Court (1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 277, 289 n.5.)   Here, Defendant filed the motion for protective order 163 days after the discovery requests were served, 131 days after her discovery responses were due, and 101 days after the parties’ stipulated extension ended.  Her motion is, therefore, untimely.  (See, e.g., Miller v. Imaged, 2023 Cal. Super. LEXIS 45548 at *2 (motion for protective order was untimely when filed months after discovery responses were due).) Relief from failure to make a timely motion for a protective order may in a proper case be available under Code Civ. Proc. § 473.  (Willis, 112 Cal.App.3d at 289 n.5.)  But Defendant has not made any showing that she has satisfied the requirements of § 473 for relief from her untimely motion for protective order.     Defendant does not address the timeliness of her motion.  She instead argues Defendant has engaged in scorch earth litigation, filing several motions every month, with the intent of inundating Defendant’s counsel.  While the Court disapproves of the excessive filings in this case and the related case, there is no explanation as to why it took so long for Defendant to file a motion for protective order which would have taken as much work as what Defendant actually did here —which is to serve boilerplate objections to the discovery requests.        Accordingly, the Court denies the motion for protective order as untimely.  The Court also denies each side’s request for sanctions.  This ruling does not mean Plaintiff does not have valid objections to the discovery requests, including whether she has a right to privacy to her tax returns and records.  Such issues will be addressed in any properly filed motion to compel further responses to the underlying discovery requests.       CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES Defendant’s motion for protective order and for sanctions.    DATED: September 27, 2023    ___________________________ Edward B.
