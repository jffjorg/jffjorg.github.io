The Court found Defendant's motion untimely, as it was filed months after the discovery responses were due. While the Court disapproves of the excessive filings in the case, it denied both the protective order and the request for sanctions. The ruling does not preclude Defendant from raising objections to specific discovery requests in a properly filed motion to compel further responses.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff LEO DAVID's motion to compel further responses to his discovery requests and Defendant AURICE VELOSO's motion for a protective order. The court has denied both motions.

Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses was denied because Plaintiff failed to file a joint statement, as required by the court's rules. The court also denied Defendant's motion for a protective order because it was filed 163 days after the discovery requests were served, which is untimely.

The court notes that Defendant's motion for a protective order is untimely, but did not address the timeliness issue. Instead, Defendant argued that Plaintiff has engaged in scorch earth litigation, filing several motions every month, with the intent of inundating Defendant's counsel. The court finds this argument unfounded and notes that Plaintiff's discovery requests are excessive and may be subject to further objections.

The court also denies each side's request for sanctions. The court finds that the issues raised by Defendant's motion for a protective order, such as the number of discovery requests, are valid and will be addressed in any properly filed motion to compel further responses to the underlying discovery requests.

The ruling does not mean that Plaintiff does not have valid objections to the discovery requests, including whether he has a right to privacy to his tax returns and records.

English text:
This tentative ruling is for the case of LEO DAVID v. AURICE VELOSO in the Superior Court of California, West District, Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205. The hearing date is September 27, 2023. The case is an employment dispute where the plaintiff, LEO DAVID, alleges that the defendant, AURICE VELOSO, stole money and personal property, engaged in financial and physical elder abuse, and breached fiduciary duty.

The plaintiff, LEO DAVID, made a motion to compel further responses to (1) requests for production of documents, set one, (2) form interrogatories, set one, (3) special interrogatories, set one, (4) requests for admissions, set one, and for sanctions. However, this motion was denied due to the plaintiff's failure to file a joint statement as required by the court's rules.

The defendant, AURICE VELOSO, also made a motion for a protective order and for sanctions. This motion was denied as it was untimely, and the defendant did not show that she satisfied the requirements for relief from an untimely motion for a protective order.

The discovery requests, including requests for production of documents, form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for admissions, are compelled, and further responses are required. However, no monetary sanctions were granted.
