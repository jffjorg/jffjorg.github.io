And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendants' ex parte application to shorten the time to hear their motion to set aside and vacate the default. The judge also denies the alternative motion to continue the default prove up hearing without prejudice, meaning that the defendants must seek this relief in a different department. The judge, however, advances and continues the motion to set aside and vacate the default from December 17, 2024 to May 7, 2024, and orders that opposition and reply papers be filed and served in accordance with the new hearing date. The moving party is required to give notice of the new hearing date.
