And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion for trial preference. The plaintiff, J.A., a minor, is seeking an early trial date due to the delay in his medically necessary brachial plexus surgery caused by the defendant, Blue Cross of California dba Anthem Blue Cross. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant's wrongful denial of inpatient hospital admission has caused him to suffer physical injury and delay in his recovery.

The judge finds that the plaintiff meets the requirements for trial preference under Code of Civil Procedure section 36, which provides that a civil action to recover damages for personal injury shall be entitled to preference if the party is under 14 years of age. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has a substantial interest in the case as a whole and that granting trial preference will serve the interests of justice.

The defendant, Blue Cross of California dba Anthem Blue Cross, argued that Section 36(b) does not apply to this case because it is an insurance dispute rather than a personal injury action. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff's allegations of physical injury and breach of contract meet the requirements for trial preference under Section 36(b). The judge also notes that the defendant's arguments against granting trial preference are unpersuasive, including their claims that the plaintiff's treating physician has never treated the need for the procedure as urgent and that there is no clear indication as to when the procedure will be performed.
