And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

In the case of Mejia v. Campione et al., the plaintiff's counsel, Farid Yadegar, has moved to be relieved as counsel. Yadegar has been unable to contact his client, Mejia, despite diligent efforts, and has provided proof of service as required under CA Rule of Court 3.1362. The motion is unopposed and the judge finds that this is a valid basis for relief. The motion to be relieved as counsel is GRANTED. The case is scheduled for trial on April 8, 2023, but Yadegar's inability to communicate with Mejia raises concerns about his ability to continue representing the plaintiff.
