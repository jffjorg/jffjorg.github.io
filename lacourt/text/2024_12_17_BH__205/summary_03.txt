And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendant, SEED LA FACILITIES, LLC. The demurrer was filed in response to the third cause of action in the plaintiff's first amended complaint, which seeks to foreclose on a mechanics lien against the property. The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, finding that the lien is invalid and barred by California law.

The judge has also denied the motion to strike, finding that the allegations in the complaint regarding the defendant's ownership of an interest in the property are clear and unambiguous. The judge has noted that the complaint alleges that the defendant holds a leasehold estate in the property, and that the lien does not limit its application to the leasehold interest.

The judge's ruling is based on the case law, including In re South Bay Expressway, L.P., which held that a mechanics lien cannot attach to public property. The judge has also considered the language of the mechanics lien and the complaint, which do not express any intent to limit the lien to the leasehold interest.

The judge has ordered that the demurrer be sustained and the motion to strike be denied. The plaintiff has been given notice that it must file an amended complaint within 20 days of the order.
