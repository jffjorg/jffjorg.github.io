```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment entered against them. The defendant claims that they did not receive actual notice of the lawsuit due to the person served with the documents not speaking English and not understanding the importance of the papers. The defendant's declaration also states that they were not trying to avoid service of process and that there was no evidence of inexcusable neglect. The judge finds that the motion is timely and that the defendant's lack of actual notice was not caused by their own fault or neglect. Therefore, the judge is granting the motion to set aside the default judgment and allowing the defendant to defend the action.
