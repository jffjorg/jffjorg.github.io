```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal with prejudice and instead entered a dismissal without prejudice. The court's decision is based on the fact that the plaintiff did not give consent to his lawyer to dismiss the case with prejudice, and that the release signed by the plaintiff only settled claims for bodily injury, not property damage. The court also found that Travelers insurance carrier's payment of $100,000.00 was for bodily injury damages, and that the company's communication with the new counsel about the property damage claim after the dismissal suggests that not all claims were settled. Therefore, the court grants relief and sets aside the dismissal with prejudice.
