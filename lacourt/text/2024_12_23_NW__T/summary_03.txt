And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel a request for production (RFP) from the defendant, Volkswagen. The defendant's preliminary response is deemed non-compliant with the California Code and is therefore stricken. The court orders the defendant to file a verified, code-compliant response to the RFP within 10 days. The response must identify all responsive documents, whether produced or not, and if any documents are being withheld due to privilege, they must be included in the privilege log. The individual objections raised by the defendant are overruled for purposes of identification.
