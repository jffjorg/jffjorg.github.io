And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted in part the motion filed by U.S. Bank National Association to join necessary parties in the lawsuit. The judge has ordered the plaintiff, Deborah Russel, to file and serve an amended complaint naming Laurie Freeman as a party to the action within 30 days. The judge has denied the motion to join Don Cummings as a necessary party, as there is no evidence that Cummings has a claim to the disputed funds. The judge has also denied the motion to dismiss the action without prejudice.
