And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the motion of Jeff W. LeBlanc, an attorney with Anderson & LeBlanc, APLC, to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Duron Trucking Services, Inc. The motion is denied without prejudice, meaning the attorney can re-file the motion if the issues are addressed. The judge notes that the motion was filed late and incomplete, and that there were issues with the service of the proposed order on the Defendant. The judge also notes that the attorney's declaration did not indicate direct confirmation of the Defendant's last known address. Despite these issues, the judge does find that the breakdown of the attorney-client relationship and breach of the attorney-client agreement are sufficient grounds for the attorney to withdraw. However, the judge requires the attorney to give notice of the ruling within five calendar days and to address the outstanding issues before re-filing the motion.
