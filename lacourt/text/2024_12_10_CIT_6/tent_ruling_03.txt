 Case Number:  24PSCV00280    Hearing Date:   December 10, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE  NAME:  Flexi-Van  Leasing, LLC. v. Duron Trucking Services, Inc.  Jeff W.  LeBlanc of Anderson & LeBlanc, APLC’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for  Defendant Duron Trucking Services, Inc.  TENTATIVE  RULING  The Court DENIES the motion of Jeff W. LeBlanc of Anderson &  LeBlanc, APLC to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Duron Trucking Services,  without prejudice.              Counsel is ordered to give notice of  the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.  BACKGROUND  This is a debt collection case. On  January 29, 2024, plaintiff Flexi-Van Leasing, LLC (Plaintiff) filed this  action against defendant Duron Trucking Services, Inc. (Defendant) and Does 1 through  10, alleging causes of action based on common counts.  On November 18, 2024, Jeff W. LeBlanc of Anderson & LeBlanc,  APLC moved to be relieved as counsel for Defendant. The motion is unopposed.  LEGAL  STANDARD  The Court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted, provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.) A motion to  be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of  Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal.  Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite  forms must be served “on the client and on all parties that have appeared in  the case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).)  DISCUSSION              Jeff W.  LeBlanc of Anderson & LeBlanc, APLC (Counsel) seeks to be relieved as  counsel for Defendant on the grounds that there has been a breakdown of the  attorney-client relationship, breach of the attorney-client agreement, and a  communication breakdown. (LeBlanc Decl., ¶ 2.) The Court finds these sufficient  grounds for withdrawal. Grounds for permitting an attorney to withdraw from  representation include the client’s conduct that, “renders it unreasonably  difficult for the lawyer to carry out the representation effectively[.]” (Cal.  Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 1.16, subd. (b)(4).) A breakdown in the  attorney-client relationship is also grounds for allowing the attorney to  withdraw. (Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.) Counsel  has also submitted the application, declaration, and proposed order on Judicial  Council forms MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362,  subds. (a), (c), (e).)              However, the Court notes some  issues. First, the motion was filed on November 18, 2024, and is therefore  untimely. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) Second, Counsel’s declaration  does not indicate having directly confirmed Defendant’s last known address as  being current. (LeBlanc Decl., ¶ 3, subd. (b)(1)(d).) Third, none of the proofs  of service submitted indicate service of the proposed order on Defendant. (Cal.  Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (d).) Fourth, Paragraph 5 of the proposed  order is incomplete, and paragraph 6 of the proposed order did not tick the box  indicating whether the address is Defendant’s current or last known address.  (Proposed Order (11/18/24), ¶¶ 5, 6.)  Fifth, Paragraph 7, subdivision (a), of the proposed order also  fails to include the time and place of the next scheduled hearing in this  action. (Proposed Order (11/18/24), ¶ 7, subd. (a).) Sixth, the declaration and  proposed order describe the next scheduled hearing only as a Case Management  Conference, and does not include the Status Conference re ADR Plan or the  deadline to meet and confer and file a Joint ADR Declaration. (LeBlanc Decl., ¶  4; Proposed Order (11/18/24), ¶ 7, subd. (b).) Finally, the Court notes that  the proofs of service indicate service by mail, but appear to indicate  electronic service on counsel for Plaintiff. This should be clarified, as the  motion needs to be served on all parties to the action. (See Cal. Rules of  Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (d).)              Based on the foregoing, the Court  DENIES the motion without prejudice.  CONCLUSION  The Court DENIES the motion of Jeff W. LeBlanc of Anderson &  LeBlanc, APLC to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Duron Trucking Services,  without prejudice.              Counsel is ordered to give notice of  the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
