And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Guven Uzun's motion to strike portions of the complaint filed by Plaintiff Casper Glenn. The motion is granted, with 30 days' leave to amend, as to paragraphs 95, 99, 100, 109, and 112, which contain language that may be interpreted as seeking penalties under the California Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA). The motion is denied as to paragraphs 104 and 106 and the prayer for relief, which do not appear to be related to PAGA claims. The Judge finds that the pleading is confusing and needs to be amended to clarify that Plaintiff is not asserting PAGA claims or seeking PAGA remedies. The ruling is based on California law and relevant case citations.
