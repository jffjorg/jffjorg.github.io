 Case Number:  23SMCV02531    Hearing Date:   November 1, 2023    Dept:  N TENTATIVE RULINGDefendant Guven Uzun’s Motion to Strike Portions of the Complaint of Plaintiff is GRANTED, with thirty (30) days leave to amend, as to paragraphs 95, 99, 100, 109, and 112, and DENIED as to paragraphs 104 and 106 and the prayer for relief.Plaintiff Casper Glenn may amend his complaint only as authorized by the Court’s order and may not amend the complaint to add a new party or cause of action without having obtained permission to do so. (Harris v. Wachovia Mortgage, FSB (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1018, 1023.)Defendant Guven Uzun to give notice. REASONINGDefendant Guven Uzun (“Defendant”) moves the Court for an order striking the portions of Plaintiff Casper Glenn (“Plaintiff”)’s complaint seeking civil penalties against Defendant on the ground that Plaintiff has not complied with the pre-filing notice and exhaustion requirements of the California Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”), codified at Labor Code section 2698 et seq. Plaintiff argues that his complaint does not assert any PAGA claims or seek any PAGA remedies against Defendant, and Plaintiff has offered to amend the pleading to delete references to seeking civil penalties in paragraphs 95, 99, 100, 109, and 112.The court may, upon motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (a).) The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (b).) The grounds for a motion to strike are that the pleading has irrelevant, false, or improper matter, or has not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436.) The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437.)Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349 [court shall not “sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment”]; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency (2002) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1037 [“A demurrer should not be sustained without leave to amend if the complaint, liberally construed, can state a cause of action under any theory or if there is a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured by amendment.”]; Vaccaro v. Kaiman (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 761, 768 [“When the defect which justifies striking a complaint is capable of cure, the court should allow leave to amend.”].) The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)Defendant’s motion is brought on a theory that Plaintiff is asserting PAGA claims and seeking penalties under PAGA, but Plaintiff states that he is not doing so. The language of the pleading is confusing, though, and it is necessary that Plaintiff amend the pleading in the manner he represents he will so Defendant and the Court may conclusively determine that Plaintiff is not asserting PAGA claims or seeking PAGA remedies. As to paragraphs 104 and 106 and the prayer for relief, which Plaintiff has not stated he will amend, there is no basis to conclude that recovery under Labor Code sections 203 and 226 apply only in a PAGA context. Accordingly, Defendant Guven Uzun’s Motion to Strike Portions of the Complaint of Plaintiff is GRANTED, with thirty (30) days leave to amend, as to paragraphs 95, 99, 100, 109, and 112, and DENIED as to paragraphs 104 and 106 and the prayer for relief.
