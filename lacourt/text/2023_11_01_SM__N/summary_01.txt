And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) has moved to consolidate two cases, one being the present case and the other being Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 23STCV19780. LAUSD argues that the cases share common issues of law and fact, and that consolidation will promote efficiency and avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts. However, the plaintiff, Jane Doe, opposes the motion, arguing that consolidation will result in a delay of her day in court and potential confusion of the jury.

The judge has considered the factors for consolidation, including timeliness, complexity, and prejudice. Although the cases arise from the same general conduct, the parties to the cases are now different, and the claims in Case No. 23STCV19780 will prejudice the plaintiff's ability to present her case against LAUSD. The judge finds that consolidation is not proper and denies LAUSD's motion to consolidate cases.
