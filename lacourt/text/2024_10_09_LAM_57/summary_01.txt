And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the case 23STCV16882. The judge has overruled the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's claim for tortious breach of the implied warranty of habitability. However, the judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike the allegations related to punitive damages. The judge has given the plaintiff leave to amend their pleadings because this is the first time the court has evaluated the sufficiency of the allegations in the plaintiff's pleadings. The judge's decision is based on the plaintiff's failure to address the defendant's arguments that the allegations in the pleadings are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages.
