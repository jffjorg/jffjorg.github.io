Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the Plaintiffs' second cause of action for trespass without leave to amend. The court finds that the Plaintiffs' allegations do not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for trespass, as they do not allege a physical entry onto the property. The court also denies the Defendants' motion to strike the Plaintiffs' claims for punitive damages, finding that the Plaintiffs have pled sufficient facts to support their claims.
