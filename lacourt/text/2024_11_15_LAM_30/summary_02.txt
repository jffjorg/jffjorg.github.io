And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiffs' claims for punitive damages. The defendants argued that the motion was timely and that the plaintiffs' claims were insufficient. The judge denied the motion, finding that the defendants had failed to serve the motion on the plaintiffs in a timely manner, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1005. The judge also found that the plaintiffs had pled sufficient facts to support their claims for punitive damages, including the defendants' ignoring of warnings and citations from the City of Los Angeles and the resulting collapse of a retaining wall and slope. The judge noted that the defendants' failure to heed warnings from officials and place lives in danger could be considered despicable, justifying punitive damages.
