The judge's tentative ruling grants the Petitioner's Motion for Order for Deposit of Undistributed Surplus Funds Proceeds of Trustee's Sale, pursuant to California Civil Code Section 2924J. The Petitioner, Quality Loan Service Corp., had filed a petition regarding unresolved claims and deposit of undistributed surplus proceeds of trustee's sale. The Petitioner's motion was continued multiple times due to deficiencies in the petition, which were addressed through supplemental declarations.

The judge finds that the Petitioner has complied with the due diligence requirements of Civil Code Section 2924J and has demonstrated a good faith, diligent effort to determine the priority of potential claimants to the surplus funds, and a conflict to determine such priority and standing.

The court orders the Petitioner to deposit the funds with the court within 10 days and to file a proper notice thereafter. The Petitioner will be discharged upon filing proper proof of posting of the funds. The court also sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Disbursement of Undistributed Surplus Funds for January 6, 2025, at 9:30 a.m. in Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse.

All claimants must file a written claim within 45 days of the order and appear at the hearing either in person or remotely. If no claims or appearances are made, the matter may be set for an OSC Re: Escheating Funds.
