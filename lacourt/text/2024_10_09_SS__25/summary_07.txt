And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Quality Loan Service Corp.'s motion for an order to deposit undistributed surplus funds from a trustee's sale. The company must electronically submit a proposed order consistent with the court's ruling within five days and provide notice of the ruling. The company must then deposit the funds with the court within ten days and file a proper notice thereafter. Once the funds are deposited, the company will be discharged. The court has set an order to show cause for January 6, 2025, at which time claimants must file written claims and appear in person or remotely. If no claims or appearances are made, the matter may be set for an OSC re: escheating funds.
