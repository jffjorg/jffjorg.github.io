ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On October 28, 2022, Plaintiff Nationwide Insurance
Company of America (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendant Andrea
Nicole Johnson (“Defendant”) and Does 1-10 alleging a common counts cause of
action. 
 
On January 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Stipulation,
Settlement Agreement, and Release (the “Settlement Agreement”). 
 
On February 3, 2023, the Hon. Mark E. Windham signed an
order dismissing the action and retained jurisdiction under Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6. (2/3/23 Order.)
 
On July 31, 2024 Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to
Enforce Settlement Agreement (the “Motion”). 
 
No opposition was filed.   
 
II.                
Legal
Standard & Discussion 
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure, section 664.6: 
 
(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the
parties outside of the presence of the court or orally before the court, for
settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties,
the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement
until performance in full of the terms of the settlement. 
 
(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed by
a party if it is signed by any of the following: 
 
(1) The party. 
(2) An attorney who represents the party. 
(3) If an insurer is defending and indemnifying a party
to the action, an agent who is authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on
the party’s behalf. This paragraph does not apply if the party whom the insurer
is defending would be liable under the terms of the settlement for any amount
above the policy limits.” 
 
The Settlement Agreement filed by
Plaintiff was signed by Plaintiff’s authorized representative Lisa Berry and by
Plaintiff’s counsel on January 20, 2023, and by Defendant on January 27, 2023. (1/27/23
Settlement, pp. 5-6.) 
 
The Settlement provides the matter
would be settled for a total sum of $5,248.46 to be paid by Defendant at a rate
of $90.98 per month, beginning February 1, 2023 and continuing on the first day
of each month thereafter until paid in full. (1/27/23 Settlement, ¶ 3.) 
 
The Settlement further states that failure
to make a timely payment constitutes a default and, in the event of default,
there is no grace period or notice of default to be given to Defendant.
(1/27/23 Settlement, ¶ 6.) When default occurs, the Settlement states “Judgment
may be entered against Defendant without notice in the sum of $4,902.58, plus
first appearance fees in the sum of $225.00 less payments received.”  (1/27/23 Settlement, ¶
6.)
The Court finds the
Settlement to be valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Procedure section
664.6. Plaintiff provides evidence that Defendant made partial payment. (Smith
Decl., ¶ 6.) As of the date this Motion was filed, however, Plaintiff had
received neither further payments from Defendant nor any emails stating she
will pay any amount. (Smith Decl., ¶ 6.) Plaintiff also presents evidence that,
although the Settlement states the parties agreed to no grace period, Plaintiff’s
counsel attempted to reach out to Defendant regarding the overdue payment to no
avail. (Smith Decl., ¶ 6.) 
 
However, the Court notes various issues with the numerical
amounts and calculations used by Plaintiff as well as Plaintiff’s requested Judgment
sum. 
 
Plaintiff requests that a judgment of $3,203.14,[1]
based on the principal amount of $1,175 plus pre-judgment costs in the
amount of $4,902.58, less payment received in the amount of $1,699.44, be
entered against Defendant. (Motion, p. 5; Smith Decl., p. 8.) To describe the
payment amount received from Defendant, Plaintiff states Defendant “made
thirteen payments of $35.88 for a total amount of $1,699.44.”  (Smith Decl. ¶ 6.)
 
As an initial matter, the Court notes
Plaintiff’s calculation for the Judgment differs from the calculation listed in
the definite terms of the Default section of the Settlement, which states:  “If payment is not received on or before the
due date as set forth above then Judgment may be entered against [Defendant]
without notice in the sum of $4,902.58, plus first appearance fees in the sum
of 225.00 less payments received.” 
(1/27/23 Settlement, ¶ 6.) Accordingly, Plaintiff’s calculation must be
modified to properly reflect the Settlement’s terms. 
 
Next, the Court notes that Plaintiff
made multiple mistakes when describing payments received from Defendant –
namely, Smith declares Defendant made “thirteen payments of $35.88”;
however, $90.98 was the agreed-upon monthly payment in the Settlement. (1/27/23 Settlement, ¶ 3.) Further,
thirteen installments of $90.98 totals $1,182.74, not $1,699.44 as Plaintiff and
Smith posit. (Notice of Motion, p. 2; Motion, pp. 3, 6-8; Smith Decl., ¶¶ 6-8.)
Accordingly, Plaintiff must correct its Motion and supporting evidence before a
judgment can be rendered.
 
Plaintiff’s Motion is CONTINUED. Plaintiff is ordered to
file an Amended Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement with supplemental papers
correcting the errors noted herein.
