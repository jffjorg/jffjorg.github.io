And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Standard Sales, LLC's motion to strike the First Amended Complaint and for sanctions against Plaintiff's counsel. The motion was based on the claim that the First Amended Complaint was filed in violation of the Court's order dated May 23, 2024, which sustained Defendant's demurrer to the original Complaint. The judge found that the request to strike the First Amended Complaint was brought on the wrong grounds, as a motion to strike in the limited jurisdiction court can only be brought on the grounds that the damages or relief sought are not supported by the allegations of the complaint. The judge also found that the motion for sanctions was improperly made in conjunction with the request to strike the First Amended Complaint and was filed on the same day as it was served. As a result, the motion for sanctions was denied.
