And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award filed by Shannon M. DeBiase, Esq. is continued to March 11, 2025, at 8:30 am in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse. The Petitioner is required to file proof of service of the instant order and notice of the new hearing date on the Respondent, Taly Bar, by February 11, 2025. The court has made this decision because the service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing was not properly completed, and therefore, the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4 and due process are not satisfied.
