DeBiase, Esq.’s Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award is CONTINUED TO MARCH 11, 2025 AT 8:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. PETITIONER IS TO FILE PROOF OF SERVICE OF THE INSTANT ORDER AND NOTICE OF NEW HEARING DATE ON RESPONDENT BY FEBRAURY 11, 2025.ANALYSIS:On July 10, 2024, Petitioner Shannon M. DeBiase, Esq. (“Petitioner”) filed the instant Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award (the “Petition”) against Respondent Taly Bar (“Respondent”). No proof of service of, nor opposition to, the Petition has been filed to date.Legal Standard"Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award. The petition shall name as respondent all parties to the arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound by the arbitration award." (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.) “If a petition or response under this chapter is duly served and filed, the court shall confirm the award as made, whether rendered in this state or another state, unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.)A response to a Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award that seeks to vacate or correct the award must be served and filed no later than 100 days after the date of the service of a signed copy of the award on the respondent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288.2.)DiscussionCode of Civil Procedure, section 1290.4 requires that the Petition and Notice of Hearing be served on Respondents “in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for the service of such petition and notice” or “[i]f the arbitration agreement does not provide the manner in which such service shall be made . . . [s]ervice within this State shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in an action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4, subds. (a), (b).)No copy of the arbitration agreement is attached to the Petition. In the absence of contractual language prescribing the method of service, the Court finds that service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing must be in the manner of service for a summons. Petitioner filed proof of substitute service on December 4, 2024. The proof of service indicates that Respondent was sub-served by delivery of the Petition and Notice of Hearing to a co-occupant at their home on December 3, 2024. (Proof of Substitute Service, filed 12/04/24, ¶5.) The documents were thereafter mailed to Respondent on December 4, 2024. (Id. at p. 6.)Service by substitute mail is complete on the tenth day after mailing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20, subd. (b).) Service on Respondent, therefore, has not yet been completed and will only be deemed effective on December 14, 2024. Accordingly, the Court finds that the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4 and for due process are not satisfied.ConclusionPetitioner Shannon M. DeBiase, Esq.’s Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award is CONTINUED TO MARCH 11, 2025 AT 8:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. PETITIONER IS TO FILE PROOF OF SERVICE OF THE INSTANT ORDER AND NOTICE OF NEW HEARING DATE ON RESPONDENT BY FEBRAURY 11, 2025.Court clerk to give notice.
