  Case Number:  23NWLC20318    Hearing Date:   December 10, 2024    Dept:  26 RXO Logistics, Inc., v. Standard Sales, LLC, et al.,TENTATIVE RULING:Defendant Standard Sales, LLC’s Motion to Strike First Amended Complaint and for Sanctions Against Plaintiff’s Counsel is DENIED.ANALYSIS:On July 14, 2023, Plaintiff RXO Logistics, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendant Standard Sales, LLC (“Defendant”). The action was originally assigned to Department Y in the Norwalk Courthouse. On May 23, 2024, the Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to the Complaint with leave to amend. (Minute Order, 05/23/24.) Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint on May 28, 2024.On July 31, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Strike First Amended Complaint and for Sanctions Against Plaintiff’s Counsel. Plaintiff filed an opposition on August 5, 2024 and Defendant replied on August 23, 2024. On September 4, 2024, before the Motion was heard, the action was transferred to Department 26 in the Spring Street Courthouse. (Minute Order, 09/04/24.)DiscussionDefendant’s request for judicial notice of the May 23, 2024 order is limited to the fact that it was made by the Court, and does not include the truth of the matters therein. (Sosinsky v. Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1560–1569.) Defendant moves to strike the First Amended Complaint on the grounds that it was filed in violation of the Court’s order dated May 23, 2024. (Motion, p. 3:3-12.) Specifically, that the First Amended Complaint was filed before Defendant filed a proposed order with respect to the ruling on the demurrer in accordance with Cal. Rules of Court rule 3.1312. (Ibid.) The request to strike the First Amended Complaint is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 436, subdivision (b), as not being filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court. However, a motion to strike in the limited jurisdiction court cannot be brought on these grounds and may only be brought on the grounds that “the damages or relief sought are not supported by the allegations of the complaint.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (d).) The request to strike the First Amended Complaint, therefore, is denied.Defendant also moves for sanctions against Plaintiff’s counsel in connection with the request to strike and pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5. As the request to strike the First Amended Complaint is denied, related sanctions will not be awarded. Regarding Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5, a motion under this statute may only be made apart from other motions, and must be served at least 21 days prior to being filed with the Court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.5, subds. (f)(1)(A), (f)(1)(B).) The instant request for sanctions was improperly made in conjunction with the request to strike the First Amended Complaint and was filed on the same day as it was served. (Proof of Electronic Service, filed 07/31/24.) The Motion cites to a declaration by defense counsel Justin Sobodash that purports to attach notice 21 days prior to filing, but no such declaration is in the Court’s file.ConclusionBased on the foregoing, Defendant Standard Sales, LLC’s Motion to Strike First Amended Complaint and for Sanctions Against Plaintiff’s Counsel is DENIED.Court clerk to give notice.
