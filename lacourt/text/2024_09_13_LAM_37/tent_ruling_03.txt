Background
 
On October 10,
2023, Kevin Kim (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Bruce Haebong Lee
(“Lee”); Seven Seung Woo Bae (“Bae”); Masters Realty Group, Inc. (“MRG”);
Masters Realty & Investment (“MRI”) (a corporation); Masters Realty &
Investment (a business); and Does 1 – 50.) This action stems from a dispute as
to whether the Defendants failed in their obligation to maintain insurance that
would have indemnified Plaintiff in an underlying action. 
 
Defendants each
demurred to the Complaint and the court sustained the demurrer with leave to
amend. The operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), filed May 8, 2024, alleges
three causes of action: 
 
1)    
Breach of Contract against
all Defendants; 
2)    
Fraud against all
Defendants, Except Defendants Bae and MRI; and
3)    
Negligent Misrepresentation
against all Defendants, Except Defendants Bae and MRI. 
 
Defendants MRI and
Bae now demurrer to the first and only cause of action alleged against them in
the FAC. Plaintiff opposes the demurrer. The matter is now before the court. 
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
The court may take
judicial notice of “official acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial
departments of the United States and of any state of the United States,”
“[r]ecords of (1) any court of this state or (2) any court of record of the
United States or of any state of the United States,” and “[f]acts and
propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of
immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably
indisputable accuracy.” (Evid. Code, § 452, subds. (c), (d), and
(h).) “Taking judicial notice of a document is not the same as accepting
the truth of its contents or accepting a particular interpretation of its
meaning.” (Joslin v. H.A.S. Ins. Brokerage (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d
369, 374.)
 
Plaintiff requests
judicial notice of the following: 
 
1)    
Exhibit 1: A true and correct copy of the Articles of Incorporation filed
by Masters Realty & Investments, Inc. with the Secretary of State on
January 7, 2004. 
 
2)    
Exhibit 2: A true and correct copy of the Certificate of Amendment of
Articles of Incorporation filed by Masters Realty & Investments, Inc. on
April 7, 2005. 
 
3)    
Exhibit 3: A true and correct copy of the LoopNet webpage at
https://www.loopnet.com/company/masters-realty-group/los-angeles-ca/7slrdpwl/,
which containing information relating to “Masters Realty Group”.
 
Plaintiff’s request
for judicial notice is granted as to Exhibit 1 and Exhibit 2. The court denies
the request as to Exhibit 3 as Plaintiff fails to show judicial notice of
Exhibit 3 is proper and not subject to dispute and capable of immediate and
accurate determination. 
 
demurrer
to first amended complaint[1]
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Where pleadings are defective, a
party may raise the defect by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950)
36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the
grounds for a demurrer must appear on the face of the pleading or from
judicially noticeable matters.¿ (CCP, § 430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) In evaluating a demurrer, the court accepts the
complainant’s properly pled facts as true and ignores contentions, deductions,
and conclusory statements. (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1976) 67 Cal.2d 695,
713; Serrano v. Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) Moreover, the court
does not consider whether a plaintiff will be able to prove the allegations or
the possible difficulty in making such proof. (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula
Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 590, 604.) 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)
 
III.      Discussion
 
A.        First Cause of Action – Breach of
Contract
 
The elements of a claim for breach of
contract are: “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance
or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting
damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51
Cal. 4th 811, 821.) In addition, the complaint must demonstrate damages
proximately caused by the breach. (St. Paul Ins. v. American Dynasty (2002)
101 Cal.App.4th 1038, 1060.) Furthermore, “the complaint must [also] indicate
on its face whether the contract is written, oral, or implied by conduct.” (Otworth
v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co. (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452, 458-59
citing CCP § 430.10(g).)
Defendants MRI and
Bae assert that the breach of contract claim fails as alleged against them
because the FAC does not connect MRI and Bae to the contract. Plaintiff does
not dispute the allegation but instead asserts that MRI and Bae’s liability
stems from alter ego liability. 
“‘A claim against a
defendant, based on the alter ego theory, is not itself a claim for substantive
relief, e.g., breach of contract ..., but rather, procedural, i.e., to
disregard the corporate entity as a distinct defendant and to hold the alter
ego individuals liable on the obligations 
of the corporation where the corporate form is being used by the
individuals to escape personal liability, sanction a fraud, or promote
injustice.’ ” (Greenspan v. LADT, LLC (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 486, 516
citing Hennessey's Tavern, Inc. v. American Air Filter Co. (1988) 204
Cal.App.3d 1351, 1359.) 
 
Accordingly,
Defendant MRI and Bae may be held liable if they are the alter ego of Defendant
MRG, the party to the contract. (FAC ¶ 29, Ex. 4.) “To succeed on their alter
ego claim, plaintiffs must be able to show: (1) such a unity of interest and
ownership between the corporation and its equitable owner that no separation
actually exists, and (2) an inequitable result if the acts in question are
treated as those of the corporation alone.” (Leek v. Cooper (2011) 194
Cal.App.4th 399, 417.) However, on demurrer, the court does not consider
whether the plaintiff will be able to prove the allegations. (See Stevens v.
Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610; Fisher v. San Pedro
Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 590, 604.)  Instead, the
court focuses on whether the complaint sets forth facts sufficient to put the
defendant on notice about what the plaintiff is complaining about and what
remedies are being sought. (Leek, at p. 415.)
 
As to the first
prong for alter ego liability, the FAC alleges that Defendants MRI and Bae
share the same address as Defendant MRG. (Id., ¶¶ 6, 7.) Defendant Bae
is the son-in-law of Defendant Lee and Lee and MRG are the brokers responsible
for Defendant Bae. (Id., ¶¶ 10, 13.) Defendants Lee and Bae operated the
real estate brokerage business under the names MRG, MRI, and Master Realty
& Investments and used the names interchangeably despite MRG being
suspended by the California Secretary of State. (Id., ¶ 15.) Defendant
Bae is also the shareholder, director and officer of MRI. (Id., Ex. 1,
2, 3.) Taking these allegations as true, Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts
to show that a unity of interest exists between Defendants MRI and Bae and
Defendant MRG, the signatory of the contract.
 
As to the second
prong, the FAC further alleges that Defendants Lee and Bae incorporated MRI for
the for the sole purpose of transferring assets out of MRG and to hinder,
defraud, and/or delay MRG’s creditors, including Plaintiff. (FAC, ¶ 15.)
Defendants Lee and Bae used MRG as a “mere shell, instrumentality, and conduit
to carry out their business such that there was no separateness between them. (Id.,
¶ 15.) Defendants Lee and Bae completely controlled, managed, and operated MRG
and intermingled assets for their own convenience. (Id., ¶ 17.) To find
that a separation exits between Defendants MRG and Bae and Lee would sanction
fraud and promote injustice and allow Defendants Lee and Bae to escape
liability. (Id., ¶ 18.) Therefore, the second prong of alter ego
liability is adequately pled. 
 
Plaintiff further
asserts that successor liability may be imposed on Defendant MRI because it is
the successor of MRG.  (FAC, ¶ 12.) 
 
Under the theory of
successor liability, “corporations cannot escape liability by a mere change of
name or a shift of assets when and where it is shown that the new corporation
is, in reality, but a continuation of the old. Especially is this well settled
when actual fraud or the rights of creditors are involved, under which
circumstances the courts uniformly hold the new corporation liable for the
debts of the former corporation.’ ” (Cleveland v. Johnson (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327 citing Blank v. Olcovich
Shoe Corp. (1937) 20 Cal.App.2d 456, 461.)

 
The demurrer to the
first cause of action is overruled.
 
motion for
judgment on the pleading as to first amended complaint[2]
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
“A motion for judgment on the pleadings
performs the same function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only
defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that can be
judicially noticed.” (Burnett v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th
1057, 1064.) “In deciding or reviewing a judgment on the pleadings, all
properly pleaded material facts are deemed to be true, as well as all facts
that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.” (Fire Ins.
Exchange v. Superior Court (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452.) When
considering demurrers and judgment on the pleadings, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Wilson v. Transit Authority of City
of Sacramento (1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 716, 720-21.) A motion for judgment on
the pleadings does not lie as to a portion of a cause of action. (Id.)
“In the case of either a demurrer or a motion for judgment on the pleadings,
leave to amend should be granted if there is any reasonable possibility that
the plaintiff can state a good cause of action.” (Gami v. Mullikin Medical
Ctr. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 870, 876.) A non-statutory motion for judgment
on the pleadings may be made any time before or during trial. (Stoops v.
Abbassi (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 644, 650.)¿¿¿ 
 
III.      Discussion
 
Defendant Lee moves
for judgment on the pleadings as to all three causes of action alleged in
the  FAC. Plaintiff asserts that
Defendant Lee may not bring a motion for judgment on the pleadings because
Defendant Lee already demurred to the first cause of action and CCP § 438(g)
only permits a MJOP  if “[t]moving party
has already demurred to the complaint or answer, as the case may be, on the
same grounds as is the basis for the motion provided for in this section and
the demurrer has been overruled, provided that there has been a material change
in applicable case law or statute since the ruling on the demurrer.” (Id.)
On March 27, 2024, this court overruled the demurrer to the first cause of
action for breach of contract. (3/27/2024 Order.)
 
The demurrer to the
first cause of action focused on whether the E&O Insurance fee was for the
benefit of Plaintiff to provide insurance coverage. (03/27/2024 Order, at p.
3.) Here, however the judgment on the pleadings focuses on the fact that Section
18 of the contract voids any prior verbal representations such that Plaintiff
cannot allege that Defendant Lee made representations to him about the E&O
policy. (FAC, ¶ 29, Ex. 4, ¶ 18.) 
 
Therefore, the
motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the first cause of action is made on
“the same grounds” as the previous demurrer and section 438(g) does not apply.
Moreover, the court retains the discretion to consider the motion for judgment
made on the same basis as a prior demurrer because “a trial judge may
reconsider and correct erroneous orders independent of the statutory
limitations imposed on reconsideration motions.” (Thomson v. Canyon (2011)
198 Cal.App.4th 594, 603; see also Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th
1094, 1106.) Therefore, the court addresses the request for judgment on the
pleadings on its merits. 
 
            A.        First Cause of Action – Breach of Contract 
 
As to the first
cause of action, Defendant Lee’s liability for breach of contract is not based
on the representations he made to Plaintiff but on allegations that he is the
alter ego of MRG. (FAC, ¶¶ 7-12, 15 -18, 25-26.) Defendant Lee does not allege
that the alter ego allegations against him are inadequately pled. Therefore,
the motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the first cause of action is
denied. 
 
B.        Second Cause and Third Cause of Action –
Negligent Misrepresenting and Fraud
 
The elements of a
misrepresentation claim are: (1) misrepresentation (false representation,
concealment, or nondisclosure); (2) knowledge of falsity (scienter); (3) intent
to defraud or induce reliance; (4) justifiable reliance; and (5) damages. (See
Civ. Code, § 1709.) Fraud actions are subject to strict requirements of
particularity in pleading. (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th
631, 645.) A plaintiff must allege what was said, by whom, in what manner (i.e.
oral or in writing), when, and, in the case of a corporate defendant, under
what authority to bind the corporation. (See Goldrich v. Natural Y Surgical
Specialties, Inc. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 772, 782.) 
 
As to the second
and third causes of action for fraud and negligence, the motion is made on the
basis that the negligence and fraud causes of action are not specifically pled.
This assertion is made on different grounds than Lee’s prior demurrer wherein Lee
argued that the insurance fee was to cover Defendant’s insurance premium and
not to provide insurance coverage to Plaintiff. (See 03/27/2024 Order, at p.
5.) 
 
The FAC alleges
that Defendant Lee represented to Plaintiff that Defendant MRG, as broker for
Plaintiff, would obtain the E&O policy for Plaintiff and would charge
plaintiff a fee of $90.00 for each transaction. (FAC, ¶ 30.) The $90.00 charge
began on July 19, 2010 and later increased to $100.00 per transaction. (Id.,
¶ 31.) On July 2, 2020, as part of the Montebello Transaction, Lee and MRG made
a Commission Disbursement Request, wherein Lee and MRG charged $100.00 for the
E&O policy. (Id., ¶ 33.) It was not until January 3, 2023, that
Plaintiff learned via an email from Defendants that the MRG’s license had
expired on June 30, 2021. (Id., ¶ 35, Ex. 7.) Despite charging for the
E&O policy during the Montebello transaction, Defendants did not have the
E&O Policy during the time that the transaction took place. 
 
The court agrees
that the negligent misrepresentation and fraud claims are not pled with the
requisite specificity. Plaintiff fails to state when Lee made the
representations about the E&O Policy, if the representations were verbal or
written, and if and how Lee continued to make those representations after the
MRG’s policy expired. Plaintiff also alleges in a conclusory manner that
“Defendants” had no reasonable grounds to believe their representations but
fails to allege specific facts as to why Plaintiff believes Defendant Lee had
no basis to believe that Plaintiff had an E&O Policy. “These conclusionary
allegations, which allege no specific acts, are insufficient to survive
demurrer.” (Bagatti v. Department of Rehabilitation (2002) 97
Cal.App.4th 344, 366, fn. 8.) Lastly, Plaintiff fails to allege that Lee was
responsible or ratified the representation made in the Commission Disbursement
Request, that the $100.00 fee was for the E&O policy. 
 
Defendant Lee’s
motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted at to the second and third
causes of action with ten days leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
The Court OVERRULES the demurrers brought
by Defendants MRI and Bae; DENIES 
Defendant Lee’s MJOP as to the first
cause of action and GRANTS the MJOP as to the second 
and third causes of action with ten days
leave to amend.  The Court sets a Non-Appearance
OSC 
re Amended Complaint for October 10,
2024, at 8:30 a.m.  Plaintiff to give
notice.
