```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint. The dismissal was due to the plaintiff's counsel's failure to appear at the non-jury trial, which was caused by a calendaring error. The court finds that the counsel's affidavit of mistake regarding the calendaring error is sufficient to set aside the dismissal. The action is reinstated, but the court has set an Order to Show Cause re: Dismissal for Failure to File Proofs of Service, as no proof of service of the summons and complaint has been filed to date. The plaintiff's counsel is required to appear at the OSC and provide evidence showing that the defendant has been served with the summons and complaint or why such service has not occurred.
