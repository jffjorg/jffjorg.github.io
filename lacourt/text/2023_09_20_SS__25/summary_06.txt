## English Summary:

The judge is considering a legal challenge (a demurrer) filed by the Law Offices of Ramin R. Younessi against Mishel Melamed's lawsuit alleging breach of contract. 

Melamed claims he hired Younessi's firm to represent him in a workers' compensation case but they were negligent, causing him additional expenses and delays.  

The judge notes that Melamed's complaint lacks crucial details about the alleged contract, how it was breached, and how those breaches resulted in the claimed $10,000 in damages. 

Because Melamed hasn't had a chance to fix these issues, the judge sustains the demurrer (dismissing the lawsuit for now) but gives Melamed 20 days to amend his complaint and provide the missing information.

## Summary of Judge's Tentative Ruling 

**Case Number:** 23STLC04002
**Plaintiff:** Mishel Melamed
**Defendant:** Law Offices of Ramin R. Younessi

**Background:**

* Plaintiff filed a breach of contract lawsuit against Defendant on June 23, 2023. 
* Defendant filed a demurrer to the complaint on August 21, 2023, and later withdrew their opposition.

**Legal Standard:**

* A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint.
* A general demurrer challenges whether the complaint states sufficient facts to support a cause of action.
*  Plaintiff must allege ultimate facts to show the basis for their claim.
* Courts consider the complaint as a whole and give it a reasonable interpretation.
* The Court must allow leave to amend unless the defect is incurable.

**Discussion:**

* The judge found that the Complaint fails to state sufficient facts to support a cause of action for breach of contract. 
*  The Complaint lacks specific allegations regarding:
    * The existence of a contract between Plaintiff and Defendant
    * How the contract was breached
    * How the alleged breach caused $10,000 in damages.

* The judge also noted that Plaintiff hired a new attorney who presumably represents him in the worker's compensation case, implying that any contract would be with that new attorney.

**Conclusion:**

* The demurrer to the breach of contract claim is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.


**English Summary:**

The judge has decided to partially dismiss the plaintiff's case against the defendant's law firm.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in Markdown format:

# Case Number
23STLC04002

# Parties
Mishel Melamed (Plaintiff) vs. Law Offices of Ramin R. Younessi (Defendant)

# Background
On June 23, 2023, Plaintiff filed an action against Defendant for breach of contract. Defendant filed a Demurrer to the Complaint on August 21, 2023, and a Notice of Non-Opposition on September 13, 2023. No opposition has been filed.

# Legal Standard
A demurrer is a pleading that may be used to test the legal sufficiency of the factual allegations in the complaint. The Court admits "all material facts properly pleaded" and gives these facts a reasonable interpretation.

# Discussion
Defendant demurs to the first cause of action for breach of contract for failure to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. The Court notes that special demurrers, on the basis that the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible, are not allowed in limited jurisdiction actions.

# Meet and Confer
Defendant's counsel states that he has made multiple attempts to meet and confer with Plaintiff in advance of filing the demurrer. The Court finds that Defendant has presented sufficient evidence that it has attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff.

# Demurrer
To prevail on a cause of action for breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove (1) the contract, (2) the plaintiff's performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the plaintiff.

# Analysis
The Complaint states that Plaintiff was injured at work and saw Defendant for worker's compensation, but Defendant never cared about Plaintiff's case. Plaintiff hired a different attorney and it took almost 10 months to see a state doctor. Plaintiff believes Defendant owes him $10,000 for 10 months of expenses.

# Conclusion
The Court finds that the allegations stated in the Complaint do not contain sufficient facts for any element of a cause of action for breach of contract. The Demurrer to the first cause of action for breach of contract is sustained with leave to amend.

**Order**
The Demurrer, filed by Defendant Law Offices of Ramin R. Younessi, is SUSTAINED with twenty (20) days leave to amend.

**Case Number:** 23STLC04002

**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023

**Dept:** 25

**Parties:** Mishel Melamed (Plaintiff) v. Law Offices of Ramin R. Younessi (Defendant)

**Summary:**

In this case, Plaintiff Mishel Melamed filed a complaint against Defendant Law Offices of Ramin R. Younessi for breach of contract on June 23, 2023. Defendant filed a Demurrer on August 21, 2023, alleging that the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. No opposition has been filed.

The Judge analyzed the legal standard for demurrers and found that the Defendant's demurrer should be sustained on the basis that the complaint fails to state sufficient facts for a breach of contract claim. The Judge noted that the plaintiff must prove the contract, the plaintiff's performance, the defendant's breach, and the resulting damage. However, the complaint does not contain any allegations regarding the existence of a contract, breach of contract, or causation.

The Judge also found that the Defendant has met the requirement to meet and confer with the Plaintiff before filing the demurrer. Therefore, the Demurrer is sustained with twenty (20) days leave to amend.

**Significant Statements:**

* "To prevail on a cause of action for breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove (1) the contract, (2) the plaintiff's performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damage."
* "The complaint is completely devoid of allegations regarding the facts that give rise to any breach of contract by the Defendant."
* "The Defendant has presented sufficient evidence that it has attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff. Thus, the requirement to meet and confer has been satisfied."
* "The Demurrer is sustained with twenty (20) days leave to amend."
