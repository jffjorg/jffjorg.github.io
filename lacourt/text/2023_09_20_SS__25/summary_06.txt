And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The Court has considered the Demurrer filed by Defendant Law Offices of Ramin R. Younessi to the Complaint filed by Plaintiff Mishel Melamed. The Demurrer argues that the Complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for breach of contract. The Court finds that the allegations in the Complaint do not contain sufficient facts for any element of a cause of action for breach of contract, including the existence of an agreement between the parties, how it was breached, and how it resulted in damages of $10,000. Therefore, the Demurrer is sustained with leave to amend.
