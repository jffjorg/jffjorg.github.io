## English Summary:

The judge is considering a legal challenge (a demurrer) filed by the Law Offices of Ramin R. Younessi against Mishel Melamed's lawsuit alleging breach of contract. 

Melamed claims he hired Younessi's firm to represent him in a workers' compensation case but they were negligent, causing him additional expenses and delays.  

The judge notes that Melamed's complaint lacks crucial details about the alleged contract, how it was breached, and how those breaches resulted in the claimed $10,000 in damages. 

Because Melamed hasn't had a chance to fix these issues, the judge sustains the demurrer (dismissing the lawsuit for now) but gives Melamed 20 days to amend his complaint and provide the missing information.
