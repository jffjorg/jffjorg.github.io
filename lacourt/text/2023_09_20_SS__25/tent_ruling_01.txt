Legal
Standard & Discussion
 
CCP § 664.6, provides a summary
procedure that enables judges to enforce a settlement agreement by entering a
judgment pursuant to the terms of the parties’ settlement.  In particular, the statute provides:
 
(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.  If requested by the parties, the court may
retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.
 
(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed by a
party if it is signed by any of the following:
 
(1) The party.
(2) An attorney who represents the party.
(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is authorized
in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer's behalf.
 
CCP §
664.6(a)-(b) (emphasis added).
 
III.           
Discussion
 
A. Retention of Jurisdiction
 
“‘[V]oluntary dismissal of an
action or special proceeding terminates the court’s jurisdiction over the
matter.’  (Conservatorship of Martha
P. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 857, 867) [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 142.) ‘If requested
by the parties,’ however, ‘the [trial] court may retain jurisdiction over
the parties to enforce [a] settlement until performance in full of the terms of
the settlement.’ (§ 664.6, italics added.)” 
(Mesa RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles (2019) 33
Cal.App.5th 913, 917.)  “‘Because of its
summary nature, strict compliance with the requirements of section 664.6 is
prerequisite to invoking the power of the court to impose a settlement
agreement.’”  (Ibid. (quoting Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 30, 37).)
 
“A request for the trial court to
retain jurisdiction under section 664.6 ‘must conform to the same three
requirements which the Legislature and the courts have deemed necessary for
section 664.6 enforcement of the settlement itself: the request must be made
(1) during the pendency of the case, not after the case has been dismissed in
its entirety, (2) by the parties themselves, and (3) either in a writing signed
by the parties or orally before the court.’” 
(Ibid. (quoting Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th
429, 440).)  “The ‘request must be
express, not implied from other language, and it must be clear and
unambiguous.’” (Ibid. (quoting Wackeen, supra, 97 Cal.App.4th at
440).)
 
Here, the parties signed a
Stipulation for Settlement and Entry of Judgment and Order (“Stipulation”)
containing the parties’ agreement for the Court to retain jurisdiction pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure § 664.6 to enforce the terms of the stipulation and
enter judgment in the event of default. 
(6-22-21 Stip. ¶ 15.)  Prior to
the dismissal of this action, the Stipulation was signed by the parties and
their representatives and submitted to the Court.  (Ibid. at p. 5.)  On July 15, 2021, the Court dismissed the
entire case pursuant to the Stipulation and expressly stated that it “shall
retain Jurisdiction to enforce the Stipulation for Settlement and Entry of
Judgment pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.”  (7-15-21 Order.)
 
The Court finds that the
Stipulation complies with § 664.6 requirements and the Court has retained
jurisdiction to enter judgment pursuant to the parties’ Stipulation in this
action.
 
B. Entry of Judgment
 
The Stipulation Agreement filed by
Plaintiff on June 22, 2021, provides that Plaintiff and Defendant agreed to
dismiss the action on the premise that Defendant would compensate Plaintiff for
the settlement amount of 14,500.00, without any interest.  (6-22-21 Stip. ¶ 5B.)  Pursuant to the Stipulation, Defendant’s
insurance carrier, Infinity Insurance, would pay the sum of $10,000.  (Ibid. at ¶ 5.A.I.)  Defendant would pay the remaining balance of
$4,500 in monthly payments of $50.00 beginning on July 1, 2021, and continuing on
the first day of each month, until the balance is paid in full.  (Ibid.
at ¶ 5.A.II.)  All parties signed the
Stipulation.  (Ibid. at p. 5.)
 
The Stipulation also provides that
Defendant will have a 10-day grace period to make payments.  (Ibid. at ¶ 10.)  If Defendant fails to make payments,
Plaintiff will provide written notice of default to Defendant.  (Ibid.)  If Defendant does not cure the default within
ten (10) days of receiving notice, “Plaintiff may immediately cause Judgment to
be entered pursuant Paragraph 4, in the amount of $21,815.33, plus costs of
suit, interest from from [sic] 3/27/2019, and attorney’s fees.”  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 8, 10.)
 
On June 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
instant Motion alleging that Defendant breached the Stipulation and seeking
judgment in the amount of $13,609.67 for the settlement amount, interest
accrued at 7% per annum, attorney’s fees and costs, minus payments from Defendant
and Defendant’s insurance carrier.  (Mot.
pp. 1-2.)
 
Around June 21, 2021, Defendant’s
insurance carrier, Infinity Insurance Company, made a payment of $10,000 to
Plaintiff.  (Mahfouz II Decl. ¶ 7.)  As of the date of the Motion, Defendant has only
made payments in the amount of $650.  (Ibid.
at ¶ 9.)  Plaintiff’s counsel sent past
due notices to Defendant on March 29 and June 5, 2023.  (Ibid. at ¶ 9, Ex. B.)  As of the date of this Motion, Defendant has
not cured the default and there is an outstanding balance remaining.  (Ibid. at ¶ 10.)  Plaintiff seeks to have the dismissal set
aside and judgment entered in the amount of $13,609.67 as follows: $21,815.33 (principal
amount), plus $873.62 (interest accrued at a legal rate of 7% per annum since
default date of December 1, 2022), plus $526.27 (costs), plus $1,044.45 (attorney’s
fees), minus $10,650.00 (payments made by Defendant and her insurance carrier).  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 11-12.)
 
Plaintiff states that it is
entitled to prejudgment interest at a rate of seven (7) percent per annum, as
set forth in the Stipulation.  (Mem. p.
5; Stip. ¶ 4.)  Plaintiff calculates
interest from December 1, 2022, date of default, to June 28, 2023, the date the
instant Motion was prepared.  (Mem. p.
5.)  Plaintiff accurately calculates
interest in the amount of $873.62.
 
Plaintiff calculates attorney’s
fees based on the Los Angeles County Superior Court Local Rule 3.214, which
provides that a recovery between $10,000.01 to $50,000 warrants $690 in
attorney’s fees, plus 3% of the excess over $10,000, amounting to a total of $1,044.45.
 (Ibid. at p. 6; Mahfouz II Decl.
¶ 12.)  Furthermore, Plaintiff has
submitted a Memorandum of Costs showing that it requests $391.27 for filing the
initial Complaint, $75 for service of process, and $60.00 for filing the
instant Motion, for a total of $526.27 in costs.  (Ibid.; Mem. of Costs.)
 
The Court finds the Stipulation to be
valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Procedure § 664.6.  Plaintiff provides evidence that Defendant stopped
making payments and did not respond to Plaintiff’s written notice of default.  Thus, a valid and signed stipulation
agreement was breached and the Court retained jurisdiction to enter judgment
upon breach.  Plaintiff has also provided
authority to show that it is entitled to the settlement amount, less any
payments made, costs incurred in enforcing the Stipulation, interest, and
attorney’s fees.  (Mem. pp. 4-6.)  The Court finds Plaintiff’s request as to
attorney’s fees and costs to be reasonable.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal,
Enforce Settlement, and Enter Judgment is GRANTED.  Dismissal entered on July 15, 2021, is
vacated, and judgment is entered for Plaintiff and against Defendant for $13,609.67
as follows: $11,165.33 (principal amount), $873.62 (interest), $526.27 (costs),
$1044.45 (attorney’s fees).
 
IV.

Insurance Company’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal, Enforce Settlement, and Enter
