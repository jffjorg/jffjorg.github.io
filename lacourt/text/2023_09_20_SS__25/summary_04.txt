The judge's tentative ruling is a continuation of the hearing on the petition to confirm the arbitration award in favor of All Premium Contractors, Inc. (Petitioner) against Kenneth Caldera (Respondent). The petition was filed by Petitioner on May 17, 2023, and Respondent filed a general denial and demand for arbitration on June 20, 2023.

The judge finds that there are deficiencies in the petition, including an incorrect address listed for the courthouse and a lack of proof that the neutral arbitrator served the final award on the parties. The judge orders Petitioner to file supplemental papers and continues the hearing to October 30, 2023.

The judge also notes that Respondent's demand for arbitration is premature and that the petition to confirm arbitration award is the proper procedure for confirming the arbitration award. The judge concludes that the hearing will proceed on October 30, 2023, and that Petitioner must file proof that the petition was served on the parties by the neutral arbitrator in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure § 1283.6.
