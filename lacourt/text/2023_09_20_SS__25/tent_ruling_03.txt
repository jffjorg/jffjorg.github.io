 Case Number:  21STLC08740    Hearing Date:   September 20, 2023    Dept:  25  State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company  v. Eddie Nieves 21stlc08740ANALYSIS:   I.                 Background   On December 10, 2021, Plaintiff  State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed an action  against Defendant Eddie Nieves aka Edward Nieves (“Defendant”) for subrogation.  The action arose out of an alleged automobile  accident on December 24, 2020, between Defendant, on the one hand, and an  individual insured by Plaintiff’s insurance policy, on the other hand.  (Compl. ¶ 6.)   Plaintiff compensated insured in the amount of $12,389.79 and filed the  instant action to recover damages from Defendant.  (Compl. pp. 2-3.)  On April 25, 2022, Defendant filed an Answer  to the Complaint. On October 10, 2022, Plaintiff  filed a Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and Request for  Sanctions.  The Court granted Plaintiff’s  Motion and request for sanctions in the amount of $460.  (11-21-22 Minute Order.)   On February 27, 2023, Plaintiff  filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.   On May 18, 2023, Defendant filed a late Opposition, two court days  before the hearing, which was not received by the Court in time to be reviewed  and considered.  On May 22, 2023, the  Court granted Plaintiff’s Motion and on June 5, 2023, judgment was entered for  Plaintiff and against Defendant for $12,389.79 (principal amount), $1,256.64  (interest), and $365.00 (costs.), for a total judgment of $14,011.43.  (5-22-23 Minute Order; 6-5-23 Judgment.)  On June 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed proof of  serving the Notice of Judgment on Defendant.   (6-27-23 Notice of Judgment.)   On June 29, 2023, Defendant filed A  Motion to Vacate Judgment and for Leave to Defend.  On July 24, 2023, the Court granted the  Motion and vacated all judgments entered against Defendant.  (7-24-23 Minute Order.)   Defendant also filed the instant  Motion to be Relieved from Deemed Admissions (“Motion”).  No opposition has been filed.   II.               Legal Standard   Code of Civil Procedure § 2033.300 provides, in pertinent  part:   “(a) A party may withdraw or amend an admission made in  response to a request for admission only on leave of court granted after notice  to all parties.   (b) The court may permit withdrawal or amendment of an  admission only if it determines that the admission was the result of mistake,  inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and that the party who obtained the  admission will not be substantially prejudiced in maintaining that party's  action or defense on the merits.”  (Code  Civ. Proc. § 2033.300(a)-(b).)   (c) The court may impose conditions  on the granting of the motion that are just, including, but not limited to, the  following:   (1) An order that the party who  obtained the admission be permitted to pursue additional discovery related to  the matter involved in the withdrawn or amended admission.   (2) An order that the costs of any  additional discovery be borne in whole or in part by the party withdrawing or  amending the admission.   “A party seeking  discretionary relief on the ground of attorney error must demonstrate that the  error was excusable, since the attorney’s negligence is imputed to the client.  [Citation.]”  (Huh v. Wang (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th  1406, 1419.)  “Excusable neglect is that  neglect which might have been the act of a reasonably prudent person under the  same circumstances.  [Citation.]” (Ibid.)   III.             Discussion   Defendant moves to be relieved  from the Court order deeming Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions (Set One)  admitted on November 21, 2022, on the grounds of attorney’s “inadvertence,  mistake or reasonable neglect.”  (Mot. p.  2.)   Defendant has submitted counsel Jon  E. Hellesen’s declaration in support of the Motion.  Hellesen explains that the former attorney  representing Defendant has left the firm, along with several other attorneys.  (Hellesen Decl. ¶¶   2-3.)   Hellesen joined the firm approximately two months prior and was recently  assigned to handle Defendant’s case.  (Ibid.)  After Hellesen was assigned to the case, he  immediately contacted Defendant and obtained a signed verification of  Defendant’s responses to the Requests for Admission.  (Ibid. at ¶ 3.)  He asserts that the failure to obtain and  provide signed verifications was due to excusable neglect because the former attorney  left the firm abruptly, and verifications could not be obtained until Hellesen  was assigned to the case and established contact with Defendant.  (Ibid. at ¶ 5.)  He attempted to meet and confer with  Plaintiff’s attorney and immediately sent the responses with verifications on  May 18, 2023.  (Ibid. at ¶ 4.)  Counsel was unable to oppose Plaintiff’s  Motions as the verification was not served at the time.  (Ibid. at ¶ 6.)  Counsel has submitted a copy of Defendant’s  unverified responses, the executed verification, and proof of service of the  verification.  (Ibid.at ¶¶ 7-9.)   No  opposition has been filed.   The Court finds that Defendant  has presented sufficient evidence that failure to respond to the Requests for  Admission was the result of his attorney’s excusable neglect.  The Court also finds that Plaintiff will not  be substantially prejudiced if Defendant is relieved from the deemed admissions  and permitted to respond to the discovery request.   Accordingly, the Court grants  Defendant’s Motion to Be Relieved from Deemed Admissions.   IV.             Conclusion & Order   For the  foregoing reasons: The Motion to Be Relieved from Deemed Admissions, filed by Defendant  Eddie Nieves, is GRANTED.  The Court’s  November 21, 2022, Order granting Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem Requests for  Admission, Set One, Admitted, is hereby VACATED.  Trial Setting Conference is scheduled for November 14, 2023, at 9:30 a.m., in Department 25 at the Spring Street Courthouse.
