 Case Number:  23STCP01692    Hearing Date:   September 20, 2023    Dept:  25  All Premium  Contractors, Inc. v. Kenneth Caldera 23stcp01692ANALYSIS:   I.                 Background   On November 7, 2022, arbitrator Stephen L. Backus, Esq.,  from the American Arbitration Association, issued a Final Award of Arbitrator  in favor of Petitioner All Premium Contractors, Inc. (“Petitioner”) and against  Respondent Kenneth Caldera (“Respondent”) in the sum of $22,249.70.  (Pet. ¶¶ 6-8, pp. 16-19.)   On May 17, 2023, Petitioner filed the instant Petition to  Confirm Arbitration Award (“Petition”) as to Respondent Caldera.  Petitioner filed proof that Respondent was  personally served with the Petition and supporting documents on May 30, 2023.  (6-7-23 Proof of Service.)   On June 20, 2023, Respondent filed a General Denial.  On June 28, 2023, Respondent filed a Demand  for Arbitration.   II.               Legal  Standard   Once  arbitration is concluded, “any arbitrator’s award is enforceable only when  confirmed as a judgment of the superior court.”   (O’Hare v. Municipal Resource Consultants (2003)  107 Cal.App.4th 267, 278.).  Any of the parties may file a  petition with the court, which must then “confirm the award, correct and  confirm it, vacate it, or dismiss the petition.”   (Code of Civil Proc. §§ 1285, 1286; EHM  Productions, Inc. v. Starline Tours of Hollywood, Inc. (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.)  “It is well settled that the scope of judicial review  of arbitration awards is extremely narrow.”  (California  Faculty Assn. v. Superior Court (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 935, 943.)  “Neither the  trial court, nor the appellate court, may ‘review the merits of the dispute,  the sufficiency of the evidence, or the arbitrator’s reasoning, nor may we  correct or review an award because of an arbitrator’s legal or factual error,  even if it appears on the award’s face.”   (EHM Productions, supra, at p.  1063-64.)   Code of Civil Procedure, § 1285.4  states: “A petition under this chapter shall:   (a)   Set forth the substance of or have  attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the  existence of such an agreement. (b)   Set forth the names of the  arbitrators. (c)   Set forth or have attached a copy of  the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.   Moreover, Code of Civil Procedure §  1283.6 provides that: “The neutral  arbitrator shall serve a signed  copy of the award on each party to the arbitration personally or by registered  or certified mail or as provided in the agreement.”  (Emphasis added.)  In addition, a party may seek a court  judgment confirming an arbitration award by filing and serving a petition no  more than four years, but not less than 10 days, after the award is served.  (Code  Civ. Proc.  §§ 1288, 1288.4.)   Code of Civil Procedure § 1290.4, the  statute governing proper service of this Petition states, in pertinent part:    “(a) A copy of the petition and a written notice of the time and place  of the hearing thereof and any other papers upon which the petition is based shall be served in the manner provided  in the arbitration agreement for the service of such petition and notice.   (b) If  the arbitration agreement does not provide the manner in which such service  shall be made and the person upon whom service is to be made has not previously  appeared in the proceeding and has not previously been served in accordance  with this subdivision: ¶ (1) Service within this State shall be made in the  manner provided by law for the service of summons in an action.   Moreover, the Court shall  vacate the award if any of the following conditions are proven:   (1)    The award was procured by  corruption, fraud or other undue means.   (2)    There was corruption in any of  the arbitrators.   (3)    The rights of the party were  substantially prejudiced by misconduct of a neutral arbitrator.   (4)    The arbitrators exceeded their  powers and the award cannot be corrected without affecting the merits of the  decision upon the controversy submitted.   (5)    The rights of the parties were  substantially prejudiced by the refusal of the arbitrators to postpone the  hearing upon sufficient cause being shown therefor or by the refusal of the  arbitrators to hear evidence material to the controversy or by other conduct of  the arbitrators contrary to the provisions of this title.   (6)    An arbitrator making the award…(B)  was subject to disqualification upon grounds specified in Section 1281.91 but  failed upon receipt of timely demand to disqualify himself or herself as  required by that provision. . . .”   (Code Civ. Proc. § 1286.2(a).)   Only where both (1) the  arbitrator abused his or her discretion and (2) there was resulting  prejudice, can a trial court properly vacate an arbitration award.  (SWAB Financial, LLC v. E*Trade Securities,  LLC (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 1181, 1198.)   A party may seek an order vacating or correcting an award in  a standalone petition “not later than 100 days after date of the service of a  signed copy of the award on the petitioner.”   (Darby v. Sisyphian, LLC (2023) 87 Cal.App.5th 1100, 1110, citing to Code of Civ. Proc. §§ 1285, 1288, 1288.2.)  Alternatively, a party may seek an order  vacating or correcting an award in its response to a prior-filed petition to  confirm that award, as provided in § 1285.2.   (Ibid.)  In this case, the  deadline for filing that response is 10 days from the date the responding party  is served with the petition to confirm, unless the deadline is extended by the  parties by an agreement in writing or by the Court for good cause.  (Ibid. at 1110-1111, citing to Code  Civ. Proc., § 1290.6.)  In Darby,  the Court ruled that if a petition to confirm arbitration award is filed less  than 90 days after the award is served, the request to vacate the award “must  be filed and served within 10 days of service of the petition to confirm.”  (Ibid. at 1110-1111.)  However, if the petition to confirm  arbitration award is filed more than 90 days after an award is served, the  request to vacate the award must be filed within 100 days of service of the  award.  (Ibid. at 1110-1111.)  While the 10-day deadline is subject to  extension by the parties or the Court, the 100-day deadline is “otherwise  immovable, as the statute setting that deadline brooks no exceptions.”  (Ibid. at 1111.)  The Court concluded that if a procedurally  proper petition to confirm arbitration award is filed and there is no timely  filing seeking to vacate or correct the award, the “trial court ‘shall’ confirm  the award.”  (Ibid. at 1113.)   III.             Discussion    Petitioner  asserts that on July 26, 2018, Petitioner and Respondent entered into a Home  Improvement Agreement containing an arbitration provision governing disputes  between the parties arising out of the Agreement.  (Pet. ¶ 4.)  A copy of the agreement is filed as  Attachment 4(b) and indicates that any controversy or claims would “be settled  by binding arbitration in accordance with the construction industry arbitration  rules of the American Arbitration Association.”   (Pet. pp. 4-15.)  On  November 7, 2022, arbitrator Stephen L. Backus, Esq.,  from the American Arbitration Association, issued a Final Award of Arbitrator  in favor of Petitioner and against Respondent in the sum of $22,249.70.  (Pet. ¶¶ 6-8, pp. 16-19.)  A copy of the Award is filed as Attachment  8(c).  (Pet. pp. 16-19.)   Petitioner filed proof that Respondent was personally  served with the Petition and supporting documents on May 30, 2023.  (6-7-23 Proof of Service.)   The  Court finds the following deficiencies in the Petition.  First, the Petition lists the Stanley Mosk  Courthouse address instead of the Spring Street Courthouse address.  (Pet. p. 1.)   However, the Notice of Hearing, issued by the Court and served on  Respondent, lists the Spring Street Courthouse, thus, Respondent has been  provided adequate notice.  Second,  Petitioner has not filed any proof that the neutral arbitrator served the Final  Award on the parties.   In  response to the Petition, Respondent has filed a General Denial and Demand for  Arbitration.  Respondent argues that  Petitioner has violated the Home Improvement Agreement by filing a complaint  instead of submitting the dispute to arbitration.  (Demand for Arbitration p. 1.)  The Court finds that that there is sufficient  evidence presented by Petitioner that it has submitted the dispute to  arbitration to the American Arbitration Association, Construction Arbitration  Tribunal.   However,  the Court continues the hearing on the Petition and orders Petitioner to file  proof that the Petition was served on the parties by the neutral arbitrator in  compliance with Code of Civil  Procedure § 1283.6. IV.             Conclusion & Order   For  the foregoing reasons,   The hearing on the Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award,  filed by All Premium Contractors, Inc., is CONTINUED to  October 30, 2023 at 10:00 a.m., in Department 25 at Spring Street  Courthouse.  Petitioner is ordered to  file supplemental papers as discussed herein at least sixteen (16) court days  before the scheduled hearing.  Failure to  do so may result in the Petition being placed off calendar or denied.     Moving party is ordered to give notice.
