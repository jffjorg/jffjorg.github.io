**Legal Issues:**
* Whether Plaintiff adequately pleaded facts to support a claim for punitive damages.

**Judge's Reasoning:**
* Punitive damages are not available for breach of contract claims.
* The Court finds Plaintiff's allegations of fraud insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages because they are conclusory and lack specific facts demonstrating oppression, fraud, or malice.

**Ruling:**
*  Defendant's Motion to Strike Plaintiff's request for punitive damages is **GRANTED** without leave to amend.

English text:
On September 20, 2023, the Judge of Department 25 of the court heard the motion to strike punitive damages from the first amended complaint filed by Defendant RidgeGate Escrow, Inc. against Plaintiff 1409 Manhattan Apt, LLC. The Judge granted the motion without leave to amend.

The case began on January 23, 2023, when Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant for breach of contract, negligence, and fraud. Defendant filed a demurrer with motion to strike on April 7, 2023. Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on April 18, 2023, and Defendant filed an answer on May 22, 2023. Defendant filed the motion to strike on the same day.

The Court analyzed the motion under Code of Civil Procedure § 436, which allows the court to strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. The Court noted that the meeting and conferring requirement was satisfied by defense counsel's declaration.

Defendant argued that Plaintiff has not pleaded sufficient facts to support punitive damages. The Court agreed and found that the allegations made in the fraud cause of action do not contain any specific facts that demonstrate oppression, fraud, or malice. Plaintiff had previously had an opportunity to amend the complaint, but did not show that another amendment could cure the defect in the pleadings.

Plaintiff alleged that Defendant's failure to set up mail forwarding was a breach of Defendant's promise and the parties' agreement. However, punitive damages cannot be awarded in an action for the breach of an obligation arising out of a contract. Plaintiff also argued that its request for punitive damages arises from the cause of action for fraud.

Plaintiff and Defendant entered into an agreement for the sale of an apartment complex. Defendant agreed to set up mail forwarding, but did not do so. Plaintiff was unaware of tax bills and accrued delinquent fees. Defendant breached its fiduciary duty and was negligent.

Defendant's agent requested Plaintiff's forwarding address with no intention of performing on the promise. Plaintiff argues that Defendant acted with criminal indifference towards Plaintiff's tax obligations.
