Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's request for punitive damages from the First Amended Complaint. The court finds that the plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to demonstrate oppression, fraud, or malice, and that the allegations made are conclusory and do not demonstrate entitlement to punitive damages. The court also notes that punitive damages cannot be awarded in an action for the breach of an obligation arising out of a contract. The court grants the motion to strike without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff will not have the opportunity to re-file the complaint with additional allegations.
