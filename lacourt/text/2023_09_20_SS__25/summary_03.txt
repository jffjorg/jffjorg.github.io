Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to be relieved from deemed admissions. The defendant, Eddie Nieves, had failed to respond to requests for admission in a timely manner, but has since presented evidence that the failure was due to his attorney's excusable neglect. The attorney, Jon E. Hellesen, had recently taken over the case and was unable to obtain verifications from the defendant in a timely manner. The judge finds that the plaintiff will not be substantially prejudiced if the defendant is relieved from the deemed admissions and permitted to respond to the discovery request. As a result, the judge grants the defendant's motion and vacates the previous order deeming the requests for admission admitted. Trial setting conference is scheduled for November 14, 2023, at 9:30 a.m.

## English Summary

The judge's tentative ruling deals with Defendant Eddie Nieves's motion to be relieved from previously deemed admissions in a lawsuit brought by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company.  

The case stems from an alleged car accident in 2020. State Farm paid out for damages to its insured and is now seeking reimbursement from Nieves.

Nieves failed to respond to State Farm's requests for admission within the required timeframe.  His previous attorney left the firm, causing a delay in responding.  State Farm had the deemed admissions granted by the court, which later resulted in a judgment against Nieves. 

Nieves successfully vacated the judgment and now seeks to be relieved from the deemed admissions.  The judge finds that Nieves's attorney's failure to respond was due to excusable neglect and that State Farm won't be significantly harmed by allowing Nieves to respond to the requests for admission. The judge grants Nieves's motion. 

The case will proceed with a trial setting conference scheduled for November 14, 2023.

## English Summary

This tentative ruling concerns a subrogation lawsuit filed by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company against Eddie Nieves for damages related to an alleged car accident in December 2020. 

The court previously granted State Farm's motion to deem Defendant's admissions admitted due to his late response to discovery requests. This ruling resulted in a judgment being entered against Mr. Nieves for over $14,000. However, the court later vacated that judgment after Mr. Nieves filed a motion to do so.

Now, Mr. Nieves has moved to be relieved from the deemed admissions. The court finds that Mr. Nieves's attorney's failure to timely respond was due to excusable neglect because of a recent change in legal representation. 

Since the court finds that State Farm won't be significantly harmed by this decision, it grants Mr. Nieves's motion. The previous deemed admissions are vacated, and a trial setting conference is scheduled for November 14th.

- Plaintiff paid $12,389.79 to an insured individual and seeks to recover damages from Defendant.
