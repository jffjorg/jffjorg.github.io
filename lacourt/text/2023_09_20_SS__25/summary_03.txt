Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to be relieved from deemed admissions. The defendant, Eddie Nieves, had failed to respond to requests for admission in a timely manner, but has since presented evidence that the failure was due to his attorney's excusable neglect. The attorney, Jon E. Hellesen, had recently taken over the case and was unable to obtain verifications from the defendant in a timely manner. The judge finds that the plaintiff will not be substantially prejudiced if the defendant is relieved from the deemed admissions and permitted to respond to the discovery request. As a result, the judge grants the defendant's motion and vacates the previous order deeming the requests for admission admitted. Trial setting conference is scheduled for November 14, 2023, at 9:30 a.m.
