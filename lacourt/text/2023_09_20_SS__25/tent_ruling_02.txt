A. Richter v. Oasis One, LLC 21stlc06807ANALYSIS:
 
I.               
Background
 
On September 20, 2021, Plaintiff
Guenther A. Richter (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendant Oasis One,
LLC, for (1) breach of contract, (2) open book account for reasonable value,
(3) open book account for agreed value, (4) account stated, and (5) unjust
enrichment.
 
On October 28, 2021, Defendant
filed a Notice of Stay of Proceedings.  On April 26, 2022, the Court
ordered the case stayed as to the entire action.  (4-26-22 Minute Order.)  On January 10, 2023, the Court found that it
had inadvertently set a bankruptcy stay instead of a stay pending arbitration,
thus, the Court lifted the stay. 
(1-10-23 Minute Order.)
On January 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Declaration Re
Entry of Stipulation for Entry of Judgment.
 
On May 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for
Court to Enter Judgment (“Motion”).  On
July 6, 2023, the Court, on its own motion, continued the hearing to August 10,
2023.  (7-6-23 Minute Order.)  On July 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of
Non-Opposition to Motion.
 
On August 10, 2023, the Court found that the memorandum
filed in support of the Motion did not comply with the California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1113, as Plaintiff had not presented a legal basis for the Court
to grant the relief requested.  (8-10-23
Minute Order.)  The Court continued the
hearing on the Motion and ordered Plaintiff to file a supplemental
memorandum.  (Ibid.)  To date, no supplemental papers have been
filed in response to the Court’s August 10, 2023, Order.
 
On September 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Case
Management Conference/Trial Setting Conference and Plaintiff’s Trial Setting
Conference Statement, set for hearing on November 14, 2023.
 
II.             
Legal Standard & Discussion
 
Plaintiff moves for a Court order
entering Judgment in this matter, pursuant to a Stipulated Judgment as agreed
to by the parties.  (Mot. pp. 1, 4.)
 
On August 10, 2023, the Court found
that Plaintiff has filed a memorandum in support of the Motion; however, the
memorandum does not comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1113, as it
does not contain “a concise statement of the law, evidence and arguments relied
on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks cited in support of
the position advanced.”  (8-10-23 Minute
Order.)  Accordingly, the Court has not
been presented with the legal basis to grant the relief requested.  (Ibid.)  For this reason, the Court continued the
hearing on the Motion and provided Plaintiff with an opportunity to file a supplemental
memorandum setting forth the legal basis and arguments that entitle Plaintiff
to the relief he requests.  (Ibid.)
 
To date, no supplemental papers
have been filed in response to the Court’s August 10, 2023, Order.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion for Court to Enter Judgment is
DENIED without prejudice.
 
III.           
Conclusion
& Order
 
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff Guenther A. Richter’s Motion for Court to Enter Judgment is DENIED
without prejudice.
 
Moving party is to give notice.
