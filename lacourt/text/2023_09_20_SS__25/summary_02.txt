However, the Court found that the memorandum filed in support of the motion did not comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1113, as it did not contain a concise statement of the law, evidence and arguments relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks cited in support of the position advanced. The Court ordered the Plaintiff to file a supplemental memorandum setting forth the legal basis and arguments that entitle the Plaintiff to the relief he requests. To date, no supplemental papers have been filed, and therefore, the motion is denied without prejudice.

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to enter judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff, Guenther A. Richter, had filed a motion for the court to enter judgment based on a stipulated judgment agreed to by the parties.
