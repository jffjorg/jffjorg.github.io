The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Guenther A. Richter's Motion for Court to Enter Judgment without prejudice. The Plaintiff filed the motion on May 2, 2023, seeking entry of judgment based on a stipulated judgment agreed to by the parties. However, the Court found that the memorandum filed in support of the motion did not comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1113, as it did not contain a concise statement of the law, evidence and arguments relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks cited in support of the position advanced. The Court ordered the Plaintiff to file a supplemental memorandum setting forth the legal basis and arguments that entitle the Plaintiff to the relief he requests. To date, no supplemental papers have been filed, and therefore, the motion is denied without prejudice.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to enter judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff, Guenther A. Richter, had filed a motion for the court to enter judgment based on a stipulated judgment agreed to by the parties. However, the court found that the plaintiff's memorandum in support of the motion did not comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1113, as it did not provide a concise statement of the law, evidence, and arguments relied on. The court had previously ordered the plaintiff to file a supplemental memorandum setting forth the legal basis and arguments for the relief requested, but no supplemental papers have been filed. Therefore, the court denied the motion without prejudice, allowing the plaintiff to refile the motion with a compliant memorandum. The case will proceed with a case management conference/trial setting conference scheduled for November 14, 2023.
