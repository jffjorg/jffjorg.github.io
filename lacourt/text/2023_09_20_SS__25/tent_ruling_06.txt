 Case Number:  23STLC04002    Hearing Date:   September 20, 2023    Dept:  25  Mishel Melamed v. Law Offices of Ramin R.
Younessi 23stlc04002ANALYSIS:
 
I.               
Background
 
On June 23, 2023, Plaintiff Mishel
Melamed (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendant Law Offices of Ramin R.
Younessi (“Defendant”) for breach of contract.
 
On August 21, 2023, Defendant filed
the instant Demurrer to the Complaint (“Demurrer”).  Defendant filed a Notice of Non-Opposition on
September 13, 2023.  No opposition has
been filed.
 
II.             
Legal Standard
 
A
demurrer is a pleading that may be used to test the legal sufficiency of the
factual allegations in the complaint. 
(Code of Civ. Proc. § 430.10.)  There are
two types of demurrers – general demurrers and special demurrers.  (See McKenney v. Purepac
Pharmaceutical Co. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 72, 77.)
 
General
demurrers can be used to attack pleadings for failure to state facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action or for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction.  (Code Civ. Proc. §
430.10(e); McKenney, 167 Cal.App.4th at 77.)  Such demurrers can be used only to challenge
defects that appear on the face of the pleading or from matters outside the
pleading that are judicially noticeable; evidence or extrinsic matters are not
considered.  (Code of Civ. Proc. §§
430.30, 430.70; Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of
the cause of action, the Court admits “all
material facts properly pleaded” and “matters which may be judicially noticed,”
but does not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law.
[Citation].”  (Blank, 39 Cal.3d at
318.)  It gives these facts “a reasonable
interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.”  (Ibid.). At the pleading stage,
a plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant
of the factual basis for the claim against him. 
(Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.)  The face of the complaint includes exhibits
attached to the complaint.  (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.) 
"If facts appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the
facts in the exhibits take precedence." 
(Holland v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th
1443, 1447.)
 
Special
demurrers can be used to attack the pleadings on grounds that the pleading is
uncertain, ambiguous, and unintelligible, or in a contract case, for failure to
allege whether a contract is oral or written. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(f).) 
However, special demurrers are not allowed in limited jurisdiction civil
actions and any grounds for special demurrers must be raised as affirmative
defenses in the answer.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 92(c).)
 
Moreover, Code of Civil
Procedure § 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this
chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose
of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 430.41(a).)  The parties are to
meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is
due.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41(a)(2).)  Thereafter, the demurring
party shall file and serve a declaration detailing their meet and confer
efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41(a)(3).)
 
When a demurrer
is sustained, the Court determines whether there is a reasonable possibility
that the defect can be cured by amendment. 
(Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  When a plaintiff “has pleaded the general set
of facts upon which his cause of action is based,” the court should give the
plaintiff an opportunity to amend his complaint, since plaintiff should not “be
deprived of his right to maintain his action on the ground that his pleadings
were defective for lack of particulars.” 
(Reed v. Norman (1957) 152 Cal.App.2d 892, 900.)  Generally, the court will allow leave to
amend on at least the first try, unless there is absolutely no possibility of
overcoming the issue.  (See Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227 ("Denial of
leave to amend constitutes an abuse of discretion unless the complaint shows on
its face it is incapable of amendment. 
[Citation.]  Liberality in
permitting amendment is the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect
has not been given.").)
 
III.           
Discussion
 
Defendant demurs to the first cause
of action for breach of contract for failure to state sufficient facts to
constitute a cause of action.  (Dem. p.
2.)  Defendant also demurs to first cause
of action on the grounds that it is “uncertain, vague, and ambiguous, which
prevents Defendant from reasonably responding.” 
(Ibid.)
 
The Court
notes that special demurrers, on the basis that the pleading is uncertain,
ambiguous, or unintelligible, are not allowed in limited jurisdiction
actions.  Accordingly, the Court will
rule on the Demurrer on the basis that the first cause of action fails to state
sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for breach of contract.
 
A.    
Meet and Confer
 
Defendant’s counsel states that he
has “made multiple attempts to meet and confer with Plaintiff in advance of
filing this demurrer.”  (Geshgian Decl. ¶ 4.)  On August 16,
2023, counsel left a voicemail and sent an email to Plaintiff in an attempt to
meet and confer.  (Ibid. ¶ 5, Ex.
B.)  On August 18, 2023, counsel left
another voicemail and sent another email to Plaintiff.  (Ibid. at ¶ 6, Ex. C.)  Plaintiff did not respond to any of defense
counsel’s communications, thus, necessitating the instant Demurrer.  (Ibid. at ¶ 7.)
 
The Court
finds that Defendant has presented sufficient evidence that it has attempted to
meet and confer with Plaintiff.  Thus,
the requirement to meet and confer has been satisfied.
 
B.    
Demurrer
 
“To prevail on a cause of action for
breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove (1) the contract, (2) the plaintiff's
performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the defendant's
breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the plaintiff.  (Richman v. Hartley (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.)  “A written
contract may be pleaded either by its terms – set out verbatim in the complaint
or a copy of the contract attached to the complaint and incorporated therein by
reference – or by its legal effect. [Citations.]  In order to plead a contract by its legal
effect, plaintiff must ‘allege the substance of its relevant terms.  This is more difficult, for it requires a
careful analysis of the instrument, comprehensiveness in statement, and
avoidance of legal conclusions.’ [Citation.]” 
(McKell v. Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457,
1489.)
 
The Complaint states the following:
 
Dear Mr. Mrs. Judge.
 
I Mishel Melamed was injured at work I
whent saw Mr. Ramin Younessi for worker’s compensation to get help and also to
represent me during my case his worker never care any thing about my case he
told me you need to see a Dr. and he will decide about your case after see the Dr.
only 45 Day Limit the Dr. send in the report again my paper work got Lost in
Ramin Younessi’s office I have proof the Dr did sent in the paper work (2)
after seeing he do not care about me I told him I do not want to be with his
Law firm right away I hired a different attoerny it took Almost 10 month’s to
see a state Dr. I believe he oweis me for 10 month’s of my expense which comes
to $10,000 – thank you.
 
(Compl.)
 
            Defendant argues that
“[t]he complaint is completely devoid of allegations regarding the facts that
give rise to any breach of contract by the Defendant” including any allegations
regarding the existence of a contract, breach of contract, and causation.  (Dem. pp. 4-5.)  Plaintiff himself states that he has hired a
new attorney to represent him in the worker’s compensation case, thus, “any
contract that Plaintiff had at the time of any alleged breach was with his new
attorneys.”  (Ibid. at p. 5.)  Furthermore, there are no allegations
regarding the terms of any agreement between Plaintiff and Defendant or how the
$10,000 in damages was caused by this breach. 
(Ibid. at pp. 5-6.)
 
            The Court
finds that the allegations stated in the Complaint do not contain sufficient
facts for any element of a cause of action for breach of contract.  Plaintiff has not alleged the existence of an
agreement between the parties, how this agreement was breached, and how it
resulted in damages of $10,000.
 
Given that Plaintiff has not had
any opportunities to amend the Complaint, the Demurrer to the first cause of
action for breach of contract is sustained with leave to amend.
 
 
 
 
 
IV.

For the foregoing reason,
 
The Demurrer, filed by Defendant
Law Offices of Ramin R. Younessi, is SUSTAINED with twenty (20) days leave to
amend.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
