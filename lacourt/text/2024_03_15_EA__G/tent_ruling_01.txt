  Case Number:  22PSCV00018    Hearing Date:   March 15, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Leslie Roberts’s Application for Default
Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Leslie Roberts’s Application for Default
Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a breach of contract and fraud action. On June 21, 2021, Plaintiff Leslie
Roberts entered into an agreement with DB West Construction, Inc. (DB West) and
Daniel Baughman (collectively, Defendants) in which Defendants agreed to
perform construction and renovation work on Roberts’s residence in Covina.
Roberts alleges various defects, life safety issues, and code violations
because of Defendants’ work, resulting in Roberts having to hire a different
contractor and incur damages in excess of $64,000.
On
January 10, 2022, Roberts filed a complaint against Defendants and Does 1-20,
alleging the following: (1) breach of contract, (2) negligent construction, (3)
intentional misrepresentation, (4) negligence supervision of construction, and
(5) negligence. On May 19, Roberts filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC)
against the same defendants, only alleging (1) breach of contract and (2)
intentional misrepresentation. On October 12, Roberts filed a Second Amended
Complaint (SAC) against the same defendants alleging the same causes of action.
On
April 10, 2023, the court struck Defendants’ answer after they failed to appear
and secure counsel.
On
July 25, 2023, default was entered against Baughman. On August 1, default was
entered against DB West. On August 24, Roberts submitted an application for
default that the court denied on October 12.
On
January 22, 2024, Roberts submitted a new proposed judgment for a
yet-to-be-filed default judgment application. On February 1, the court advised
Roberts’s counsel that counsel must submit a complete default judgment packet.
On February 2, Roberts submitted another proposed judgment, statement of case,
and declarations. On March 7, the court denied Roberts’s application as
incomplete.
On March
8, 2024, Roberts filed the present application for default judgment. An OSC Re:
Default/Default Judgment is set for March 15.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Roberts
seeks default judgment against Baughman and DB West in the total amount of $77,540,
including $64,000 in damages, $12,800 in interest, and $740 in costs. Because
the court finds Roberts has submitted sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS Roberts’s
application for default judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Roberts’s
application for default judgment is GRANTED.
