And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Leslie Roberts's application for default judgment against DB West Construction, Inc. and Daniel Baughman. Roberts seeks judgment in the amount of $77,540, including $64,000 in damages, $12,800 in interest, and $740 in costs. The court finds that Roberts has submitted sufficient evidence to support his claim and has complied with the legal requirements for a default judgment. The dispute arises from a breach of contract and fraud action, in which Roberts alleges that DB West and Baughman failed to perform construction and renovation work on his residence in Covina in accordance with the agreement. The court has previously struck the defendants' answer due to their failure to appear and secure counsel, and default was entered against both defendants. Roberts has submitted several proposed judgments and declarations in support of his application, which the court has reviewed and found to be sufficient.
