And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of First Technology Federal Credit Union (Plaintiff) and granted its application for a Writ of Possession to recover a 2022 Tesla Model X Vehicle Identification Number 7SAXCBE69NF333811 (the "Vehicle"). The Vehicle was loaned to Defendant Matthew Christopher Thomas (Defendant) under a Loan and Security Agreements on November 29, 2022, but Defendant defaulted on the loan and failed to make payments. The Plaintiff has demonstrated probable cause to believe that the Vehicle is located at 3988 East Hardy Street, Apartment 132, Inglewood, California 90303.

The Judge found that the Plaintiff has satisfied all the requirements for issuing a Writ of Possession, including demonstrating probable validity of its claim, showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the Defendant, providing a particular description and value of the property, and stating that the property has not been taken for a tax, assessment, or fine, or seized under an execution against the Plaintiff's property.

The Judge has also issued a Turnover Order, directing the Defendant to transfer possession of the Vehicle to the Plaintiff, and has not required an undertaking to be filed as the Defendant has no interest in the property.
