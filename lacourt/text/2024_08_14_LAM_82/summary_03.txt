And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Stephen I. Goorvitch, has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $4,700 to Cesar Magdaleno Jr. (Petitioner). The Petitioner had filed a petition for writ of mandate against the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to set aside its decision suspending his driving privilege for one year. The judge found that the DMV did not comply with the holding of a previous case, DUI Lawyers Association v. California Department of Motor Vehicles (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 517, and that the Hearing Officer engaged in arbitrary and capricious conduct during the administrative hearing. The judge concluded that the Petitioner is entitled to attorney's fees under Government Code section 800 and ordered that the motion for attorney's fees be granted. The judge also ordered that the Petitioner may include costs of $1,506.93 in the judgment and that the Petitioner's counsel shall provide notice and file proof of service with the court.
