Petitioner’s
request for costs is not at issue in this motion, as Government Code section
800 only authorizes an award of fees. 
(See Hammond Decl. ¶¶ 4-7; see also Oppo. 5, fn. 1.)  Costs are handled by way of a memorandum of
costs and any motion to tax costs.  Respondent
does not intend to file a motion to tax costs, stating: “Petitioner’s requested
costs appear to be permissible under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5.”  Therefore, those costs in the amount of $1,506.93
may be added to the judgment.
