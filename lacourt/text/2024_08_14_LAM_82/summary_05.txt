And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Petitioner's petition to relieve her from the claim presentation requirement of Government Code section 945.4. The petition was filed after the six-month deadline to present a claim, and Petitioner's counsel failed to provide sufficient evidence to show that the failure to file the claim on time was excusable. The court notes that Petitioner's hospitalization due to pregnancy complications was not adequately supported by evidence, and Petitioner did not explain why she could not have submitted the claim before she was hospitalized. The court also found that Petitioner's counsel's failure to file the claim on time was not excusable, as there was no evidence of diligent investigation and pursuit of the claim. The petition is denied, and the hearing is continued to a later date.
