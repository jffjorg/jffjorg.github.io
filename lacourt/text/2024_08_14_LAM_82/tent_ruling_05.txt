TENTATIVE ORDER
 
 
INTRODUCTION
 
            Petitioner
Trenice Shanae Smith (“Petitioner”) petitions for an order relieving Petitioner
from the claim presentation requirement of Government Code section 945.4 with
respect to her claim for damages against Respondent City of Los Angeles
(“Respondent” or the “City”).  The
underlying case arises from a car accident between Petitioner and a City
employee that occurred on April 17, 2023. 

 
BACKGROUND
 
             On April 17, 2023, Petitioner was involved in
an “automobile v. automobile … accident … [with] Carlos Luis Acosta, a City of
Los Angeles employee with the Los Angeles Police Department.”  (Petition (“Pet.”) ¶ 3.)  “A comprehensive traffic collision report was
conducted and prepared by the City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles Police Department.”  (Id. ¶ 4; see also Hayes Decl. ¶ 2
& Exh. A.)  The traffic report states
that, after the accident, Petitioner complained of “pain to lower
abdomen.”  (Hayes Decl. Exh. A at 3 of
12.)  The report also states that Acosta
“was the cause of this traffic crash by making an unsafe lane change.”  (Id. at 11 of 12.)
 
On October 16, 2023, Petitioner was
admitted to the hospital due to pregnancy complications.  (Pet. ¶ 7.) 
On this date, an unspecified person from “Mgdesyan Law Firm attempted to
contact [Petitioner] … to obtain information as to the incident, including but
not limited to actual date, time, and location of incident, but was unable to
reach [her].”  (Galajian Decl. ¶ 4.)  Petitioner’s counsel declares that “staff at
Mgdesyan Law Firm … erred in overlooking to obtain exact date of incident and
location from [Petitioner] prior to October 17, 2023 (the six-month application
timeline).”  (Id. ¶ 5.)
 
On October 19, 2023, Mgdesyan Law
Firm presented a claim for damages to City. 
(Id. ¶ 6.)  The City denied
the claim on the grounds it was untimely in a letter dated October 31, 2023.  (Ibid.; Hayes Decl. Exh. C.)
 
Petitioner’s counsel submitted an
application for leave to present a late claim. 
(Hayes Decl. ¶ 2 & Exh. D.) 
The cover letter is dated March 4, 2024; the letter is post-marked March
6, 2024; and the City received the application on March 8, 2024.  (Hayes Decl. ¶ 2 & Exh. D.)  The City denied the application on April 2,
2024.  (Id. Exh. E.)  
 
Petitioner filed this petition on
March 23, 2024.  The court held a trial
setting conference on July 17, 2024, but Petitioner’s counsel did not
appear.  The court set the hearing on the
petition for August 14, 2024, and provided notice: “If Petitioner’s
counsel does not appear on the hearing date, either remotely or in person,
Petitioner shall waive the right to be heard on the petition and shall submit
to any decision the court makes on the petition.”  Although counsel for the City filed an
opposition to the petition, Petitioner’s counsel did not file a reply
brief.  
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
Government Code
section 911.2(a) states that “a claim relating to a cause of action for death
or for injury to person or to personal property . . . shall be presented . . .
not later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action.”  If a claimant fails to make a claim within
six months pursuant to Government Code section 911.2, the claimant may make a
written application to the board of the public entity for permission to present
a late claim within a reasonable time but not to exceed one year from the
accrual of the cause of action.  (Gov.
Code § 911.4(a)-(b).)  If, pursuant to
the provisions of Government Code section 911.6, the board denies the
application to present a late claim, the claimant may petition the Court for
relief from the requirements of Government Code section 945.4.  (Gov. Code § 946.6(a).)
 
Government Code
section 946.6(b) requires that the petition to the court must show each of the
following: (1) that the late claim application made to the board was denied or
deemed denied; (2) the reason for failure to present the claim within six
months of the accrual of the cause of action; and (3) the contents of the claim
as required by Government Code section 910. 
The petition must be filed within six months after the application to
present a late claim to the board was denied or deemed to be denied.  (Ibid.) 

 
The petitioner
bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the
late-claim application was made within a reasonable time and that one of the
statutory requirements under Government Code section 946.6(c) was met.  (Drummond
v. County of Fresno (1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 1406, 1410.)  Under section 946.4(e), the trial court must
make its determination upon the petition, “relying upon any affidavits in
support of, or in opposition to, the petition and any additional evidence
received at hearing on the petition.”  (Ebersol v. Cowan (1983) 35 Cal.3d 427,
431.)  
 
“Section 946.6 is
a remedial statue intended to provide relief from technical rules which
otherwise provide a trap for the unwary claimant.”  (Id. at 435.)  “[D]oubts will be resolved in favor of the
party attempting to get to trial to the end that wherever possible, cases may
be heard on their merits.”  (Kaslavage
v. West Kern County Water Dist. (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 529, 537.)  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Petitioner’s claim for damages arose on April 17, 2023, which is the
date of the accident.  Petitioner filed her
government claim on October 19, 2023, two days after the six-month limitations
period expired.  Accordingly, City denied
the claim as untimely.  (Hayes Decl. Exhs.
B & C.)  Petitioner the submitted a
written application to City for leave to present a late claim on or about March
8, 2024, within one year of accrual of Petitioner’s claim.  (Id. Exh. D.)  The court finds that the late-claim
application was made within a “reasonable time.”  (See Gov. Code 
§
911.4(a)-(b).)  
 
Nevertheless, the
court denies the petition because Petitioner provides insufficient information
to satisfy her burden.  Petitioner contends that she failed to file a timely government claim
because she “was tending to her health and the health of her unborn child which
led to the mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect of presenting the claim
untimely.”  (Pet. 5:21-6:3.)  There is no declaration from Petitioner, so
the court has no admissible evidence that Petitioner was, in fact, hospitalized
on October 16, 2023, due to pregnancy complications, or that these issues
prevented her from filing her government claim on October 17, 2023.  Similarly, there is no explanation of how the
alleged hospitalization on October 16, 2024, prevented Petitioner from filing
the claim on or before October 17, 2023. 
It appears that Petitioner’s argument is that she retained counsel to
help her file the claim; Petitioner was unable to speak to counsel due to her
hospitalization; and therefore counsel did not know the exact deadline and was
unable to submit the claim until October 19, 2023, when counsel could finally
speak to her and gain her approval to submit the claim.  Without a declaration from Petitioner,
however, the court cannot grant this petition. 
Nor does Petitioner explain why she could not have submitted the claim
before she was hospitalized.
 
The petition also alleges that “counsel did not have specifics as to
exact date, time, location of the incident to properly present the claim” due
to “[c]ounsel’s staff err[or].” (Pet. 5:21-6:3.)  The neglect of counsel is “imputed” to the
client.  (Ebersol v. Cowan (1983)
35 Cal.3d 427, 436.)  “The party seeking
relief based on a claim of mistake must establish he was diligent in
investigating and pursuing the claim.”  (Department
of Water & Power v. Sup.Ct. (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1288, 1293.)  “Once the potential plaintiff has retained
counsel, it is the responsibility of counsel to diligently investigate the
facts, identify possible defendants, and timely file the tort claim.
[Citation.] Section 946.6 expressly requires a showing of excusable neglect
for relief from the failure to file a tort claim.”  (Id. at 1294, fn. 3.)  
 
The only evidence
presented with the petition is a declaration of Petitioner’s counsel, Karapet
Galajian.  Several paragraphs of
Galajian’s declaration are worded as his “contentions” about certain facts,
rather than affirmative statements of fact, which weakens the evidentiary value
of this declaration.  (See Galajian Decl.
¶¶ 2-4.)  Further, Galajian does not
describe when his law firm was retained or what steps the law firm took to
investigate the claim prior to the six-month deadline.  (Id. ¶¶ 2-6.)  Although Galajian declares that “staff at
Mgdesyan Law Firm had erred in overlooking to obtain exact date of incident and
location,” he does not identify who committed this error or describe the nature
of error.  (See Id. ¶ 5.)  Given the conclusory nature of Galajian’s
declaration, the court cannot find that any error of the Mgdesyan Law Firm was
excusable or that it was actually this error that caused Petitioner to miss the
deadline to file a claim.
