And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Ameripride Services, LLC, filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted. The plaintiff, Ana Rubio, brought causes of action against the defendant for disability discrimination, associational disability discrimination, and wrongful termination. The plaintiff's claims failed because she did not produce adequate evidence of a disability. The defendant filed a memorandum of costs seeking $4,203.80 in costs. The plaintiff moved to strike the cost memorandum in its entirety or alternatively to tax certain items therein. The court held that the plaintiff's action was not frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless when brought. Therefore, the defendant is not entitled to recover costs. The court granted the plaintiff's motion to strike the memorandum of costs in full.
