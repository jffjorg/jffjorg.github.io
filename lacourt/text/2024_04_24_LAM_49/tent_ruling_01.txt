Plaintiff brings causes of action against Defendant for (1) Disability Discrimination, (2) Associational Disability Discrimination, (3) Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodations, (4) Failure to Engage in Good Faith Interactive Process, (5) Retaliation, and (6) Wrongful Termination.On January 23, 2024, this court granted Defendant’s motion for summary judgment, and on February 13, 2024, entered judgment in Defendant’s favor. Plaintiff now moves to tax or strike the memorandum of costs filed by Defendant on February 28, 2024. Defendant opposed. TENTATIVE RULING:Plaintiff’s Motion to Strike the Memorandum of Costs is GRANTED in full. Plaintiff is ordered to give notice, unless waived. DISCUSSION:Motion to Tax or Strike CostsA. Legal StandardIn general, the prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding.  (Code Civ. Proc., §1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606; Scott Co. Of Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.)  Allowable costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 must be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation, and must be reasonable in amount.  An item not specifically allowable under section 1033.5(a) nor prohibited under subdivision (b) may nevertheless be recoverable in the discretion of the court if they meet the above requirements (i.e., reasonably necessary and reasonable in amount). (Ladas v. California State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-774.)   “A prevailing party who claims costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs within 15 days after the date of service of the notice of entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5 or the date of service of written notice of entry of judgment or dismissal, or within 180 days after entry of judgment, whichever is first.” (Cal. Rule Ct., rule 3.1700(a)(1).)  California Rule of Court, Rule 3.1700(b)(1) requires that “Any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum. If the cost memorandum was served by mail, the period is extended” to 20 days. (Cal. Rule Ct., rule, rule 3.1700(b)(1).) When the items on the verified cost bill appear to be proper, the burden of proof is on the contesting party. (Fennessy v. Deleuw-Cather Corp., 218 Cal. App. 3d 1192, 267 Cal. Rptr. 772 (1st Dist. 1990)).  However, when items claimed as costs do not appear on their face as proper and necessary and the items are properly challenged by a motion to tax costs, the burden of establishing the necessity of the items is on the party claiming them as costs. (Whitney v. Whitney, 164 Cal. App. 2d 577, 330 P.2d 947 (1st Dist. 1958)).  B. AnalysisIn this case, Plaintiff brought causes of action against Defendant for (1) Disability Discrimination, (2) Associational Disability Discrimination, (3) Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodations, (4) Failure to Engage in Good Faith Interactive Process, (5) Retaliation, and (6) Wrongful Termination. On January 23, 2024, this court granted Defendant’s motion for summary judgment, concluding that Plaintiff had not produced adequate evidence that either she or her husband had actually suffered from a disability.  (See 01/23/24 Final Ruling, p. 7.) For that reason, her claims failed. That Ruling is incorporated herein by reference.As the prevailing party, Defendant filed a memorandum of costs on February 28, 2024, seeking $4,203.80 in costs. Plaintiff now moves to strike the cost memo in its entirety, or alternatively, to tax certain items therein.Defendant maintains that it is entitled to costs because “Plaintiff’s claims were frivolous and objectively groundless.” Defendant contends that Plaintiff, who has sued her employers in the past, knew from the start that her claims lacked merit.“In civil actions brought under this section, the court, in its discretion, may award to the prevailing party, including the department, reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, including expert witness fees, except that, notwithstanding Section 998 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a prevailing defendant shall not be awarded fees and costs unless the court finds the action was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless when brought, or the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.” (CCP § 12965(b).) A prevailing defendant in a FEHA case “should not be awarded fees and costs unless the court finds the action was objectively without foundation when brought, or the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.” (Williams v. Chino Valley Indep. Fire Dist. (2015) 61 Cal. 4th 97, 115.)Here, considering the totality of the circumstances, Plaintiff’s action was not frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless when brought. While Plaintiff ultimately could not meet her burden to produce evidence to demonstrate a disability, she maintained a good faith and legitimate argument on that issue. Indeed, this court initially issued a Tentative Ruling denying the motion for summary judgment, but upon reconsideration, invited supplemental briefing on the limited issue of whether Plaintiff or her husband suffered from a disability under the FEHA. (See 12/01/23 Minute Order.) After considering that briefing, this court concluded they did not, and thus, ultimately issued a final ruling in Defendant’s favor. (See 01/23/24 Final Ruling.)A losing action is not necessarily a frivolous one. This court granted summary judgment for the simple fact that Plaintiff had not produced adequate evidence of a disability to survive summary judgment. However, “[t]he fact that plaintiffs did not develop sufficient evidence…does not mean that the action had absolutely no basis in fact.” (Leek v. Cooper (2011) 194 Cal. App. 4th 399, 421.) The Supreme Court has cautioned lower courts to “resist the understandable temptation to engage in post hoc reasoning by concluding that, because a plaintiff did not ultimately prevail, his action must have been unreasonable or without foundation.” (Christiansburg Garment Co. v. Equal Emp. Opportunity Comm'n (1978) 434 U.S. 412, 422.) “This kind of hindsight logic,” the Court continued, “could discourage all but the most airtight claims, for seldom can a prospective plaintiff be sure of ultimate success.” (Id.)Based on these considerations, the court concludes Plaintiff’s action was not frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless when brought. Therefore, Defendant is not entitled to recover costs. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Strike the Memorandum of Costs is GRANTED in full.IT IS SO ORDERED.Dated:   April 24, 2024 ___________________________________ Randolph M.
