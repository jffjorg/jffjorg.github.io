Summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a demurrer and motion to strike the complaint filed by Defendant Michael Broukhim. The court sustains the demurrer to the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, finding that the allegations do not meet the requirements for extreme and outrageous conduct. The court also grants the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages, finding that the allegations do not support a finding of malice, oppression, or fraud. However, the court denies the motion to strike the prayer for prejudgment interest, finding that prejudgment interest may be awarded even if damages are not certain. The court gives the plaintiffs 20 days to amend their complaint and grants the defendant 20 days to amend his response.
