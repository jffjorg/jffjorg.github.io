And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendant. The plaintiff, FirmTech Inc., is a start-up company specializing in "male sexual wellness" products. The defendant, Digital Mind State, is a strategic agency that was supposed to perform social media management, procure speaking engagements, and assist with the plaintiff's capitalization, growth, and fundraising efforts.

The plaintiff entered into a consulting agreement with the defendant, but the defendant failed to perform its obligations under the agreement. The plaintiff paid $25,000 under the agreement, but the defendant only made two introductions to investors and failed to secure any speaking engagements. The defendant also failed to provide bi-weekly reports required under the agreement.

The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendant, but the defendant did not respond. The plaintiff requested entry of default, which was granted. The plaintiff then requested default judgment, which the judge grants. The judgment is in the amount of $27,208.20, which includes $25,000 in damages, $1,140 in attorneys' fees, and $1,068.29 in costs.

The judge finds that the plaintiff has properly complied with all the substantive and procedural requirements for a default judgment. The judge also notes that the defendant has not appeared or filed any responses, so default judgment is appropriate.
