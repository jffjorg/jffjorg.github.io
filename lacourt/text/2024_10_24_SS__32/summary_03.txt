And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed a petition for approval of a compromise for a person with a disability filed by Enma Amarilis Tereth on behalf of Claimant Andrew Flores. The judge denies the petition without prejudice due to several defects. These defects include the lack of a guardian ad litem, the absence of proof of a conservatorship, and insufficient support for the amount of attorney fees requested. The judge also notes that the plan proposed for the distribution of the settlement funds is unclear and requires further explanation. The judge orders the petitioner to attach an order showing she has authority to compromise on Claimant's behalf, provide an English copy of the fee agreement, and submit a revised plan for the distribution of the settlement funds.
