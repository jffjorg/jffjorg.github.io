And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants defendant Fernando Lopez Rojas' motions to compel the depositions of plaintiffs Jocelyn Montoya and Idalia Hernandez. The judge finds that the plaintiffs have failed to respond to requests for discovery and have failed to appear for deposition, which justifies the granting of the motions. The judge also grants defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $445 against each plaintiff and their counsel of record, jointly and severally. The judge orders the plaintiffs to appear for deposition within 10 and 20 days, respectively, and requires the plaintiffs to pay the monetary sanctions within 30 days.
