Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the petition for approval of compromise for a person with a disability, filed by Ernesto G. Martinez, Jr. on behalf of Claimant Kimberly Martinez. The petition is denied without prejudice due to several deficiencies. The petition requests $166,666 in attorney fees, which must be supported by a declaration from the attorney explaining the basis for the request. The proposed trust instrument also has defects, including the failure to provide notice to state agencies and the absence of traditional terms required by the court. The trustee must provide a bond, and the calculation of the bond is $358,000. The court requires a revised petition to be filed and served by October 31, 2024, and a proposed order (MC-351) must be completed and filed. The hearing is continued to November 22, 2024, at 1:30 p.m. in Department 32 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
