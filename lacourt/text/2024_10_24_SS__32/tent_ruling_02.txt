The Court has reviewed the
amended petition filed on October 18, 2024 by Petitioner Annette Dolores Kellam
(Petitioner) on behalf of Claimant Joe Perry Kellam, age 16. The Court denies the petition without
prejudice for the following reasons: 
 
As an initial matter, the Court notes that two petitions
were filed in conjunction with this hearing reservation: one filed on September
26, 2024, and the other filed on October 18, 2024. The Court notes that both
contain different defects. For ease of correction, the Court will address the
defects in the most recent petition filed on October 18, 2024. 
 
Petitioner must provide attachment 8. Every revised
petition must contain all attachments and information included in previous
petitions.  
 
Item 12b(5)(a)(ii) states there are $4,000.99 in medical
liens after reductions. However, based on the values in 12b(5)(b), there are $7,090
in liens. Additionally, while Petitioner marked, “continued on attachment
12b(5)”, no attachment was provided. Furthermore, none of these values equal
$18,090.99, which Petitioner claims is the amount in medical expenses to be
reimbursed. (See item 12a(4) and 16b.) The values in item 12b(4)(c) and
12b(5)(a)(ii) should equal the total medical reimbursement value in item
12a(4). 
 
Petitioner must provide the attorney declaration in
attachment 13a. 
 
There is a typo in item 16c.
 
Item 17b(4) must be completed. 
 
Attachment 18b2 must be provided. 
 
In the proposed order (MC-351), the correct hearing date
must be written. As stated in the previous minute order, item 8a(2) must
contain the $2,743.64 in non-medical expenses. Item 8a(3) (and the attachment)
must contain all information for the medical service providers that have liens
and will be reimbursed. This should match the information in item 12b5 in the
petition. (Min. Order, 7/8/24.) Item 8a(3) should reflect the total medical
reimbursements sought; the petition states this value is $18,090.99. 
 
 
Accordingly, the Court denies the petition without
prejudice.
 
Petitioner shall give notice and file a
proof of service of such.
