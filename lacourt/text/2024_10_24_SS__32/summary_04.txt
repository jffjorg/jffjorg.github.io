And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Rosa Soriano's motion to continue trial and reopen discovery. The motion was filed on behalf of Plaintiff, who seeks to continue trial and reopen discovery to complete depositions and a site inspection. The judge found that Plaintiff failed to provide sufficient good cause to reopen discovery, as Plaintiff did not attempt to schedule depositions earlier and did not file motions to compel earlier. Additionally, the judge found that Plaintiff's counsel was unavailable for trial on October 14, 2024, but this argument is now moot since the trial has been continued to November 2024. The judge concluded that there is no good cause to continue trial.
