And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling notes that the Plaintiff, Pavlovich, alleged that a "pen register" and "trap and trace device" are referred to collectively as "Pen-Traps" or "PR/TT". The Judge also references a previous California Supreme Court case, Pavlovich v. Superior Court, which noted that Pavlovich had no contacts with California, including no work, property, bank accounts, or telephone listings. The only contact Pavlovich had with California was when LiVid, a company, posted DeCSS source code containing DVD CCA's proprietary information on an Internet Web site.
