[1]Plaintiff alleges
that “[a] ‘pen register’ and ‘trap and trace device’ are collectively referred
to herein as ‘Pen-Traps’ or ‘PR/TT’”. (Compl., ¶ 13.) 


[2]In Pavlovich v.
Superior Court,
supra, 29 Cal.4th at pages 273-274, the California Supreme Court
noted that “[i]n this case, Pavlovich’s sole contact with California is
LiVid’s posting of the DeCSS source code containing DVD CCA’s proprietary
information on an Internet Web site accessible to any person with Internet
access. Pavlovich never worked in California. He owned no
property in California, maintained no bank accounts in California, and had
no telephone listings in California. Neither Pavlovich nor his
company solicited or transacted any business in California. The record
also contains no evidence of any LiVid contacts with California.”
