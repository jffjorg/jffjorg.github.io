[1]It appears
Plaintiff’s reference to “Second Amended Complaint” in the caption page of the
motion is a typo, as Plaintiff moves for “an order permitting the filing of a
First Amended Complaint…” (Notice of Mot. at p. 2:6-7.)  


[2]The caption page
of the Complaint lists a fifteenth cause of action for “unfair competition.”
However, the Complaint does not appear to allege any unfair competition cause
of action. 


[3] In the supplemental reply, Plaintiff states that “[t]o expedite and
assist, Plaintiff’s counsel will stipulate to shortened notice period for any
demurrer motion [sic] Defendants seek to file.” (Suppl. Reply at p. 4:18-19.)
