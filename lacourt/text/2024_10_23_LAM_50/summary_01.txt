And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC). The FAC was filed on February 22, 2024, despite the court's March 7, 2023 Order granting the defendants' motion to compel arbitration, which stayed the action pending completion of arbitration. The plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the March 7, 2023 Order was denied on November 14, 2023. The judge finds that the FAC was not filed in conformity with the court's order and grants the defendants' motion to strike. The defendants are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
