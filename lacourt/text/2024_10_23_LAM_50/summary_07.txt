And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Beaudet discloses that she and her husband purchased a pickup truck 24 years ago, which developed electrical problems. The manufacturer and dealer eventually agreed to take the truck back and refund the purchase price. Although Judge Beaudet does not believe her personal experience will bias her in this case, she is providing notice to the parties that she may be required to recuse herself if a party believes she is biased. The parties have until January 2, 2025, to file a statement of disqualification if they believe Judge Beaudet is biased. The case management conference will be continued to July 13, 2025, unless both parties waive their right to file a statement.
