  ORDER RE:
 
DEFENDANTS’
  MOTION TO STRIKE PLAINTIFF SRI RAMANATHAN’S FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT
 



 
Background
On August 17, 2022,
Plaintiff Sri Ramanathan (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants G2
Secure Staff LLC and Saeed Bholat (jointly, “Defendants”). On February 22,
2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), alleging eight causes
of action. 
Defendants now move to
strike the FAC pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 436. Plaintiff opposes. 

Request for Judicial Notice 
The Court grants Defendants’ request for judicial notice. 
Discussion 
A
court may strike any “¿irrelevant, false, or improper matter¿inserted in any
pleading¿” or any part of a pleading “¿not drawn or filed in conformity with
the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.¿” (¿Code Civ. Proc., § 436¿.) “¿The grounds for a motion
to strike shall appear on the face of the challenged pleading or from any
matter of which the court is required to take judicial notice.¿” (¿Code Civ. Proc., § 437¿.)  
As
set forth above, on February
22, 2024, Plaintiff filed the FAC, alleging eight causes of action. Defendants
assert that the FAC must be stricken because it was filed in violation of, inter
alia, a court order. Defendants note that on March 7, 2023,
the Court issued an Order granting Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration. The
March 7, 2023 Order provides, inter alia, that “Defendants’ motion to
compel arbitration is granted. The entire action is stayed pending completion
of arbitration of Plaintiff’s arbitrable claims.” (March 7, 2023 Order at p.
10:19-20.)[1]
On November 14, 2023, the Court issued a minute order denying Plaintiff’s
motion for reconsideration of the Cout’s March 7, 2023 Order. (See
November 14, 2023 Minute Order.)  
Defendants
assert that the filing of the FAC violates the Court’s Order granting
Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration. The Court agrees. As discussed above,
the Court’s March 7, 2023 Order provides that “Defendants’ motion to compel
arbitration is granted. The entire action is stayed pending completion of
arbitration of Plaintiff’s arbitrable claims.” (March 7, 2023 Order at p.
10:19-20.) Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s FAC was not filed “in
conformity with…an order of the court.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 436, subd. (b).) 
In
the opposition, Plaintiff contends that “[t]he order to compel arbitration,
which stemmed from the court’s ruling dated March 7, 2023, had been based on
the original complaint that has since been superseded by the FAC. Consequently,
the Order compelling arbitration is no more effective [sic] because that was
based on the original Complaint, which is no longer operative.” (Opp’n at p.
4:2-6.) Plaintiff does not cite any legal authority to support the proposition
that Plaintiff’s filing of the FAC somehow renders the March 7, 2023 Order
ineffective.  
Based
on the foregoing, the Court grants Defendants’ motion to strike Plaintiff’s
FAC. 
Conclusion 
Based
on the foregoing, Defendants’ motion to strike Plaintiff’s FAC is
granted. 
Defendants
are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
