BACKGROUND
                
This is a lemon law action arising out
of the purchase of a 2018 Ford Fusion manufactured and distributed by Defendant
Ford Motor Company. Plaintiff brings this action for violations of the
Song-Beverly Act and negligent repair. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
The Song-Beverly Act provides, “[i]f
the buyer prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed
by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate
amount of costs and expenses, including attorney's fees based on actual time
expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer
in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.” (Civ. Code
§ 1794(d).) 
 
Plaintiff asserts that the Knight Law
Group, LLP incurred $22,737.00 in fees and $2,948.79 in costs to prosecute this
action. Plaintiffs request that the Court apply a 1.5 multiplier, for an
additional $11,368.50 in fees. 
 
1. Multiplier
 
Plaintiff asks the Court to apply a 1.5
multiplier to counsel’s fees due to the novelty, difficulty, and skill
displayed in the case and the contingent nature of the case. The Court is
permitted, but not required, to apply a multiplier to an award for attorney’s fees
if, among other reasons, there was contingent risk or exceptional skill
displayed by the attorneys. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1138.) In
applying a multiplier for contingent risk, “the trial court should consider whether, and to what
extent, the attorney and client have been able to mitigate the risk of
nonpayment…” (Id.) There is no evidence that this case involved anything
novel, nor did it require exceptional skill. This is a standard lemon law
action. There is no basis for a multiplier.
 
2. Lodestar
 
Plaintiff seeks $22,737.00 in fees to
prosecute this case. Plaintiff’s counsel charges between $295.00 and $550.00
per hour and spent 60.8 hours on this case over approximately one year.
Defendant argues that counsel’s hours are unreasonable and counsel’s hourly
rates are excessive. The Court does not take issue with counsel’s hourly rates.
The Court also does not find counsel’s billing entries excessive. None of the
entries cited by Defendant are so egregious to warrant being reduced. The Court
finds that counsel’s fees are reasonable.
 
3. Costs
 
Defendant requests the Court strike
costs not authorized under CCP § 1033.5. The Song-Beverly Act allows a consumer
to recover costs and “expenses” outside of CCP § 1033.5.
 
Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED in the
amount of $22,737.00 in attorney fees and $2,948.79 in costs.
