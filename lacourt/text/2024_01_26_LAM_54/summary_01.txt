And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $22,737.00 and costs of $2,948.79. The plaintiff brought a lemon law action against Ford Motor Company, alleging that the company failed to properly repair a 2018 Ford Fusion that was purchased. The plaintiff's counsel, Knight Law Group, LLP, incurred these fees and costs to prosecute the case.

The judge granted the motion, finding that the fees and costs are reasonable. The judge did not apply a multiplier to the fees, as the case did not involve exceptional skill or novelty. The judge also rejected the defendant's argument that the plaintiff's counsel's hourly rates were excessive.

The plaintiff is ordered to notice the defendant of the tentative ruling. If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, they must email the courtroom by 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
