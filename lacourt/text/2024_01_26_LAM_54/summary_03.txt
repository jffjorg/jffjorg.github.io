And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Timothy Ryan, M.D. v. County of Los Angeles, sustaining the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint without leave to amend. The plaintiff had alleged Labor Code violations under PAGA, but the defendant argued that the action is barred by the one-year statute of limitations. The judge found that the plaintiff's notice to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) was not timely filed, and even if it was, the suit remains barred. The plaintiff's action is therefore dismissed. The defendant's motion to strike is moot.
