Hearing Date: January 26, 2024
Department 54, Judge Maurice A. Leiter
Motion to Compel Compliance
Moving Party: Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
Responding Party: Plaintiff Sajith Weerasinghe
 
T/R:     DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE IS GRANTED.
PLAINTIFF TO SERVE ALL RESPONSIVE DOCUMENTS, AND/OR A SWORN STATEMENT
THAT ALL RESPONSIVE DOCUMENTS IN DEFENDANT’S POSSESSION AND CONTROL HAVE BEEN
SERVED, WITHIN 30 DAYS OF NOTICE OF RULING.
DEFENDANT TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the
tentative, please email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with notice to opposing counsel
(or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
 
The Court considers the moving papers,
opposition, and reply.
 
CCP § 2031.320(a) provides “[i]f a
party filing a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling. . . thereafter fails to permit the inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling in accordance with that party's statement of compliance,
the demanding party may move for an order compelling compliance.”
 
Defendant moves to compel Plaintiff’s compliance
with the statement of compliance in response to requests for production of
documents. Defendant asserts Plaintiff has failed to produce all responsive
documents. At Plaintiff’s deposition, he identified certain “Profit
Distribution Documents.” In opposition, Plaintiff asserts all responsive
documents in his control have been produced.
 
As the parties dispute whether all
responsive documents have been served, the Court will order Plaintiff to
provide all responsive documents, and/or a sworn statement that all responsive
documents in Plaintiff’s possession and control have been served, within 30
days of notice of ruling.
