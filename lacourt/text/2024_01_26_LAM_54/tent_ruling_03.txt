BACKGROUND
 
 On
November 8, 2023, Plaintiff Timothy Ryan filed the operative first amended
complaint against Defendant County of Los Angeles for Labor Code violations
under PAGA.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer to a complaint may be taken to the whole complaint or to any
of the causes of action in it.  (CCP §
430.50(a).)  A demurrer challenges only
the legal sufficiency of the complaint, not the truth of its factual
allegations or the plaintiff's ability to prove those allegations.  (Picton v. Anderson Union High Sch. Dist. (1996)
50 Cal. App. 4th 726, 732.)  The court
must treat as true the complaint's material factual allegations, but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.  (Id. at 732-33.)  The complaint is to be construed liberally to
determine whether a cause of action has been stated.  (Id. at 733.)
 
Defendant demurs to the FAC on the ground that it is barred by the
one-year statute of limitations for PAGA actions. A demurrer lies where the
dates alleged in the complaint show “clearly and affirmatively” that the action
is barred by a statute of limitations. 
It is not enough that the complaint shows that the action may be
barred.  (Geneva Towers Ltd.
Partnership v. City of San Francisco (2003) 29 Cal.4th 769, 781.)
 
Plaintiff’s employment with Defendant was terminated on October 12,
2018. Plaintiff alleges he appealed his termination through the Los Angeles County Civil Service Commission, which
issued a final order upholding the termination on January 8, 2020. Plaintiff
served written notice of this PAGA action to the LWDA on September 20, 2021. Plaintiff
has not received notice from the LWDA that they intend to pursue his claims. Plaintiff
filed this action on August 3, 2023.
 
The parties argue extensively
over any tolling that may have occurred after Plaintiff was fired. Regardless
of whether the statute was tolled while Plaintiff pursued other remedies or
while COVID-19 emergency orders were in effect, Plaintiff’s action is barred. 
 
Plaintiff filed notice to the
LWDA on September 20, 2021. Under Labor Code § 2699.3(a)(2)(A), the LWDA has 60 days to notify
an employee that it does not intend to investigate their claims. “Upon receipt of that notice or if
no notice is provided within 65 calendar days of the postmark date of the
notice given pursuant to paragraph (1), the aggrieved employee may commence a
civil action pursuant to Section 2699.” (Id.) Plaintiff did not receive notice
from the LWDA within 65 days, starting the clock again to file suit on November
24, 2021. (See Arce v. Ensign Group, Inc. (2023) 314 Cal.Rptr.3d 493,
500 [“But because a would-be PAGA plaintiff can only bring her claim to court
65 days after submitting a prefiling notice to the LWDA, the statute of
limitations is tolled for 65 days from the time the notice is submitted.”]) Plaintiff
then waited 1 year and 8 months to file suit. Even assuming Plaintiff’s LWDA
notice was timely filed, this suit remains barred. 
 
Defendant’s demurrer is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
