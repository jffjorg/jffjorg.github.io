The judge has issued a tentative ruling overruling the demurrer filed by the defendants. The defendants argued that the complaint did not state a cause of action and that the plaintiffs did not sufficiently allege the terms of the contract. The judge disagreed, finding that the complaint sufficiently alleges the material terms of the contract and that the defendants failed to provide a habitable room to the plaintiffs. The judge also granted the request for judicial notice of certain documents related to the property transfer and deed of trust. The defendants are ordered to file an answer within 10 days.
