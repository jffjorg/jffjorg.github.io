```

And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the court does not have personal jurisdiction over the Blue Ridge defendants. The court finds that the Blue Ridge defendants do not have sufficient contacts with California to establish general jurisdiction. The court also determines that the exercise of jurisdiction is not reasonable, as the alleged hacking occurred in Virginia and the Blue Ridge defendants did not purposefully avail themselves of the California forum. The court suggests that the plaintiffs re-file the case in a Virginia court, where jurisdiction over the Blue Ridge defendants appears to be unquestionably reasonable.
