And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants, Gordon Leon, Michael Barth, Jim Knight, and Colleen Miller, who have filed a demurrer and motion to strike portions of the complaint filed by Conjunction Junction, LLC. The judge has also tentatively granted the defendants' motion for a protective order to stay all discovery pending resolution of the pleading issues raised by the demurrer and motion to strike.

The judge has concluded that the plaintiff's claims against the defendants are time-barred under Code of Civil Procedure section 349.1, which sets a six-month statute of limitations for contesting the validity of acts or proceedings taken under color of law for the formation of a public entity. The judge has found that ACLAD was formed in 1981 and that the City Council Resolutions in 1981 established the district. The judge has also found that the defendants' exhibits, including Resolution 81-12, demonstrate that a Plan of Control was adopted in 1981 and that the district was properly formed.

The judge has scheduled a hearing on March 12, 2024, to take argument on the plaintiff's objections to the City Council Resolution and to consider the defendants' motion for a protective order.
