And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint is sustained, with 30 days leave to amend. The plaintiff, Robert Johnson, alleges that the defendant, California Rehabilitation Institute, LLC and Select Hospitals Investors, LP, failed to provide necessary medical care to his deceased mother, Patricia Johnson, resulting in her development of pressure ulcers, deep tissue injuries, and resulting complications. However, the judge believes that the plaintiff has failed to state facts that meet the heightened standard of pleading for elder abuse and neglect. The judge is allowing the plaintiff an opportunity to amend the complaint, but advises that the facts of the amended pleading must show a failure to provide necessary medical care, not just a negligent rendering of medical care that caused harm. The plaintiff is not allowed to add new parties or causes of action without permission from the court.
