And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted Cross-Defendant Jeff Leal's motion to continue the trial date from November 25, 2024, to a later date to be determined. The Court finds that there is good cause to continue the trial due to the unavailability of Plaintiff's deposition and the lack of cooperation from Plaintiff in providing discovery. The Court has considered the proximity of the trial date, the length of the continuance requested, and the impact on other pending trials. The Court has also taken into account the fact that Plaintiff's counsel was relieved on March 7, 2024, and that Cross-Defendant has diligently attempted to obtain discovery and Plaintiff's deposition, yet Plaintiff has continuously failed to respond or appear. The Court finds that the interests of justice are best served by a continuance, and the trial date will be continued to a later date to be determined.
