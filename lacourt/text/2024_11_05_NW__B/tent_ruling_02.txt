TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Petitioner
Mary Tuccio’s Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or
Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a Disability is DENIED.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This
action arises from a November 22, 2019, incident in which Claimant Anthony
Ramirez (“Claimant”) alleges Defendant Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School
District (“Defendant”) negligently owned and maintained public property,
causing Claimant to sustain injury as a result.
 
On August 31, 2020, Claimant filed an action against
Defendant for four causes of action: (1) dangerous condition of public
property; (2) negligence; (3) negligent infliction of emotional distress; and
(4) negligent hiring, supervision, or retention of an employee.
 
On September 1, 2020, Petitioner Mary Tuccio
(“Petitioner”)’s application for appointment as Claimant’s guardian ad litem
was granted.
 
On October 18, 2024, Petitioner filed the
instant Petition to Confirm Minor’s Compromise of Claim or Action or
Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a Disability on
behalf of Claimant.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Petitioner
seeks court approval for a settlement under which Claimant would receive $99,000.00
from Defendant.
 
Legal
Standard
 
An enforceable settlement of a minor’s or
incompetent’s claim can only be consummated with court approval. (Prob. Code,
§§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) For this purpose, a
petition for approval must be presented to the court and until it is granted,
there is no final settlement. (Scruton v. Korean Air Lines Co. (1995) 39
Cal.App.4th 1596, 1603-1606.) Any settlement agreement therefore is voidable by
the minor’s guardian ad litem. (Id., at p. 1606.) 
 
Probate Code section 3600, et seq., governs how
the settlement proceeds are to be paid. Pursuant to Probate Code section 3601,
the order shall approve payment of reasonable expenses from the settlement as
follows: 
 
The court making the order or giving the
judgment referred to in Section 3600, as a part thereof, shall make a further
order authorizing and directing that such reasonable expenses (medical or
otherwise and including reimbursement to a parent, guardian, or conservator),
costs, and attorney’s fees, as the court shall approve and allow therein, shall
be paid from the money or other property to be paid or delivered for the
benefit of the minor or incompetent person. (Prob. Code, § 3601, subd. (a).) 
 
In cases pursuant to Probate Code section 3601,
“unless the court has approved the fee agreement in advance, the court must use
a reasonable fee standard when approving and allowing the amount of attorney’s
fees payable from money or property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a
minor or a person with a disability.” (Cal. Rules of Court 7.955, subd.
(a)(1).) In doing so, “[t]he court must give consideration to the terms of any
representation agreement made between the attorney and the representative of the
minor or person with a disability and must evaluate the agreement based on the
facts and circumstances existing at the time the agreement was made, except
where the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a
disability contemplated that the attorney's fee would be affected by later
events.” (Cal. Rules of Court 7.955, subd. (a)(2).)
 
Discussion
 
Petitioner
seeks court approval for a settlement under which Claimant would receive $99,000.00.
Of the $99,000 settlement, $10,678.19 is to be deducted for medical expenses,
$24,750.00 for attorney’s fees, and $29,488.19 for costs. Therefore, Claimant’s
proposed net settlement amount is $34,083.62.
 
The
Petition sets forth information that bears upon the reasonableness of the
compromise pursuant to CRC Rule 7.950. (MC-350 Attachment 8 [medical records].)
Additionally, attorney’s fees represent 25% of the total settlement agreement.
(MC-350 Attachment 13a.) Claimant’s counsel provides their retainer agreement as
Attachment 17a.
 
The
Petition requests an additional order, requiring Petitioner to use Claimant’s
settlement for Claimant’s private school tuition and “nothing else.” (MC-350
Item 20.) The order would also require Petitioner to inform the Court
immediately if Claimant ceases to attend private school. The Court finds this
additional order reasonable and in the best interest of Claimant.
 
However,
the Court must deny the Petition for deficiencies. Counsel completed Item 17e,
indicating that they represent or are employed by another party or insurance
carrier in this matter. Despite completing this item, Counsel fails to provide
the required Attachment 17e identifying and explaining this relationship. 
 
This is
Petitioner’s first denial for deficiencies. Petitioner and Counsel are advised
that further deficient filings risk sanctions pursuant to CCP § 128.7 and CRC
Rule 2.30. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES the
petition to confirm minor’s compromise.
