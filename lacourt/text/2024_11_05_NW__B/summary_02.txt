And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a Disability. The Petition was filed on behalf of Claimant Anthony Ramirez, a minor, who was injured in an incident on November 22, 2019, allegedly due to the negligence of the Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District. The Petitioner, Mary Tuccio, seeks court approval for a settlement under which Claimant would receive $99,000.00. However, the Court must deny the Petition due to deficiencies in the filing. Counsel failed to provide the required attachments, including one that identifies and explains their relationship with another party or insurance carrier. The Court advises Petitioner and Counsel that further deficient filings may result in sanctions.
