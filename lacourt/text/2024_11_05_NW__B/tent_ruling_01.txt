Re:                         19STCV02691 Ryan Nathan Goldstein vs Aria
Servatjoo, et al.

 

 
Plaintiff Ryan Nathan Goldstein’s Request
for Default Judgment
 
Defendant: Aria Servatjoo
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff Ryan Nathan Goldstein’s request
for default judgment against Defendant Aria Servatjoo is DENIED.
            
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from an alleged
January 20, 2017, assault. Plaintiff Ryan Nathan Goldstein (“Plaintiff”)
alleges that Defendant Aria Servatjoo (“Aria”) became belligerent and assaulted
Plaintiff. Plaintiff further alleges that Defendants Parviz Servatjoo
(“Parviz”) and Nahid Servatjoo (“Nahid”) knew Aria was violent and dangerous
and failed to prevent Aria from injuring Plaintiff.
 
On January 18, 2019, Plaintiff filed a
complaint alleging six causes of action: (1) negligence; (2) assault; (3)
battery; (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (5) negligent
infliction of emotional distress; and (6) negligent supervision.
 
On June 7, 2024, the case was reassigned
to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East,
effective June 24, 2024.
 
On August 27, 2024, Defendants Parviz and
Nahid were dismissed.
 
On October 23, 2024, Defendant Aria (hereinafter
“Defendant”) entered default. At the same time Plaintiff filed the instant
request for default judgment against Defendant.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 585 permits
entry of a default judgment after a party has failed to timely respond or
appear. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 585.) A party seeking judgment on the
default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief
summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support
of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a
memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration of nonmilitary status;
(6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom
judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579,
supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary;
and (9) a request for attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement
of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800.) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff seeks damages in the total
amount of $230,675.00, representing $28,532.00 in special damages, $200,000.00
in general damages, and $2,143.00 in costs.
 
Plaintiff fails to provide admissible
evidence supporting their claim for special damages. Plaintiff’s declaration
claims to provide medical bills as Exhibits A through D, however, no such
medical bills are provided. 
 
Additionally, Plaintiff seeks general
damages in an amount 7x greater than pleaded special damages. Plaintiff appears
to seek punitive damages based on the case law they provide in Exhibit B. However,
the request for default judgment fails to pray for punitive damages. Punitive
damages that are not properly pleaded may not be awarded. (CCP §425.115.)
Additionally, Plaintiff must serve Defendant with a a statement of damages
identifying punitive damages. (Ibid.) Plaintiff must also submit
evidence that punitive damages are not excessive in light of Defendant’s
ability to pay. (Cummings Medical Corp v. Occupational Medical Corp. (1992)
10 Cal.App.4th 1291)
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request for
default judgment is DENIED. This constitutes Plaintiff’s fifth default
judgment denial for deficiencies. Accordingly, the Court dismisses the action without
prejudice for failure to prosecute and timely obtain default judgment pursuant
to CCP sections 583.410 and CRC 3.110(h).
