Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for a default judgment against the defendant, Aria Servatjoo. The plaintiff alleged that Aria assaulted him on January 20, 2017, and sought damages of $230,675.00. However, the judge found that the plaintiff failed to provide admissible evidence to support his claim for special damages and that his request for general damages was excessive. Additionally, the judge ruled that the plaintiff's request for default judgment failed to pray for punitive damages, which the plaintiff was seeking. The judge granted the defendant's default, but denied the plaintiff's request for a default judgment. As a result, the case is dismissed without prejudice for failure to prosecute and timely obtain a default judgment.
