And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Mumtaz Jetha, claims that the defendants, Laserway Medical Group, Inc. and Laserway, LLC, were negligent in performing a laser hair removal procedure that caused her to suffer second-degree burns. The defendants argue that their treatment was within the standard of care and that the plaintiff's injuries were not caused by their negligence. The court finds that the defendants' expert declaration, submitted by Dr. Keith Marcus, is conclusory and lacks a reasoned explanation of the standard of care and the conduct required to meet it. The court concludes that the defendants did not meet their initial burden of production and therefore are not entitled to summary judgment.
