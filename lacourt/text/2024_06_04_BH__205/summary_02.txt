And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Corp. Realty USA, LLC's motion to vacate the dismissal of their complaint. The judge found that the court has fundamental jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter, and therefore, the court's order of dismissal is voidable, not void. The judge also found that Gomez Law, APC, never substituted into the case to represent Corp. Realty USA, LLC, and therefore, any failure to serve Gomez Law, APC with notices of ruling is of no consequence.
