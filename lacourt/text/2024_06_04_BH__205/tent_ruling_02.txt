 Case Number:  23SMCV03556    Hearing Date:   June 4, 2024    Dept:  205    Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   EDGAR A. MEINHARDT, et al.,  Plaintiffs, v.  SUNNY ACRE LLC, et al.,   Defendants.    Case No.:  20SMCV00492     Hearing Date:  June 4, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   PLAINTIFF CORP. REALTY USA, LLC’S    MOTION TO VACATE SEPTEMBER 8,    2023 ORDER      BACKGROUND Plaintiff Edgar Meinhardt alleges Defendants1 misrepresented the terms of a home loan, including the amount of the loan, and then wrongfully foreclosed on his home.  The property at issue is located at 10936 Pacific View Drive, Malibu, California in Ventura County (the “Property”).     Plaintiff is the sole managing member of Corp. Realty USA, LLC (“CRU”), the trustee and borrower identified on the Deed of Trust and Note for the Property.  (First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) ¶2.) The operative complaint alleges sixteen claims for (1) violation of Civil Code section 2923.5, (2) wrongful foreclosure, (3) to set aside foreclosure sale, (4) violation of Civil Code section 2924.12, (5) violation of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), (6) rescission and damages under the Truth in Lending Act (TILA); (7) violation of the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA), (8) fraud and deceit, (9) negligent misrepresentation, (10) negligence, (11) breach of contract, (12) quiet title, (13) cancellation of instruments, (14) accounting, (15) unfair competition in violation of Bus. & Prof. Code section 17200, and (16) declaratory relief. The complaint was originally filed by Meinhardt and CRU.  On September 8, 2023, the Court dismissed CRU as it was not represented by counsel.   This hearing is on CRU’s motion to vacate the Court’s dismissal.  CRU argues that it was in fact represented by counsel, Susan Murphy of Gomez Law PC.  According to CRU, while Ms. Murphy told Plaintiff she intended to withdraw, she never filed a motion to be relieved as counsel, and accordingly, she remained counsel of record.  Defendant did not serve Ms. Murphy with the notices of ruling relating to the two Order to Show Cause (“OSC”) hearings (one on July 13, 2023 and another on August 9, 2023) that eventually resulted in the dismissal of CRU’s complaint on September 8, 2023, depriving CRU of notice and the opportunity to be heard.  In any event, according to Plaintiff, the notices of ruling materially misrepresented the Court’s July 13 and August 9 minute orders, neither of which gave notice that CRU would be dismissed.     LEGAL STANDARD Code Civ. Proc. §473(d) states that, “The court may … on motion of either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or order.”  A void judgment may be attacked at any time either directly or collaterally.  (Tearlach Resources Limited v. Western States Internat., Inc.¿(2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 773, 779.) A judgment is void where the court that rendered it lacked “fundamental jurisdiction,” meaning it had no “power to hear or determine the case [due to] an absence of authority over the subject matter or the parties.” (Kabran v. Sharp Memorial Hospital¿(2017) 2 Cal.5th 330, 339.)  Put differently, “[a] judgment is void if the court rendering it lacked subject matter jurisdiction or jurisdiction over the parties.”  (Pajaro Valley Water Management Agency v. McGrath¿(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1100.)  For example, “if a defendant is not validly served with a summons and complaint, the court lacks personal jurisdiction and a default judgment in such action is subject to being set aside as void.”  (Lee v. An¿(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 558, 564 620.)¿ Where a court with fundamental jurisdiction acts “in excess of its jurisdiction or defined power, . . . the judgment [is] voidable,” not void.  (In re Marriage of Goddard¿(2004) 33 Cal.4th 49, 56.)  A voidable judgment may not be set aside beyond the six month time limit set forth in Code Civ. Proc. §473(b).  (Lee v. An¿(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 558, 563.)  “The six-month limit [for relief under¿section 473, subdivision (b)] is mandatory; a court has no authority to grant relief under [the provision], unless an application is made within the six-month period.” (Arambula v. Union Carbide Corp.¿(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 333, 340.) REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE CRU asks the Court to take judicial notice of (1) the register of actions in this case; (2) the notice of appearance by Ms. Murphy as counsel for Meinhardt and CRU; (3) the substitution of attorney naming Meinhardt as counsel for himself; (4) the Court’s July 13, 2023 minute order; (5) the notice of ruling relating to the July 13, 2023 minute order and the proof of service; (6) the Court’s August 9, 2023 minute order; (7) the notice of ruling for the August 9, 2023 minute order and the proof of service; (8) the Court’s September 8, 2023 minute order; (9) the Clerk’s proof of service of the September 8, 2023 order; (10) the notice of ruling of the September 8, 2023 minute order and the proof of service; (11) Plaintiff’s notice of removal of his federal claims to federal court; (12) the federal court order remanding the federal claims to state court; (13) the notice of appeal of the order of remand; (14) the Court’s March 2024 order denying the motion to join CRU as a necessary party; (15) the Clerk’s proof of service of the March 25, 2024 order, and (16) the substitution of attorney naming Al West as counsel for CRU.   Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice is not made in a¿separate document in violation of California¿Rules of Court, Rule 3.113. (Cal. Rules Ct. 3.1113(l) (“Any request for judicial notice must be made in a separate document listing the specific items for which notice is required.”)  Notwithstanding, the Court grants the request pursuant to Cal. Evid. Code §§ 452(d) and 453.   DISCUSSION  CRU contends the Court’s order of dismissal is void because it was issued without giving it an opportunity to be heard in violation of its due process rights.  But California courts have held that, where fundamental jurisdiction is not lacking, the issuance of an order or judgment without due process constitutes an act in excess of jurisdiction that renders the¿order or judgment voidable, not void.   For example, in¿Lee v. An, the trial court entered default judgment against the appellant for failure to appear at a case management conference and denied her subsequent¿section 473, subdivision (d)¿motion to vacate.  (Lee, 168 Cal.App.4th at 562-563.)  On appeal, the appellant argued the judgment was void because she was not given notice that her failure to appear could result in terminating sanctions.  (Id.¿at 562.)  The court of appeal acknowledged that “the due process requirement that appellant be given notice of potential sanctions and an opportunity to be heard prior to their imposition” had not been satisfied.  (Id.¿at 565.)  Nevertheless, because “the [trial] court had fundamental jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter,” the court of appeal reasoned that the imposition of “terminating sanctions without adequate prior notice” constituted an act in excess of the trial court’s jurisdiction, which rendered the judgment voidable, not void. (Id.¿at 565.)  As such, the “[a]ppellant was not entitled to relief under¿section 473, subdivision (d)¿. . . .” (Id.¿at 566.) Here, CRU does not argue that the Court lacks personal or subject matter jurisdiction.  As such, the Court has fundamental jurisdiction, and the judgment is not void.  At most, CRU’s arguments would support a finding that the Court’s order of dismissal was voidable, not void, and therefore, CRU had six months to bring its motion.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 473(b).)  CRU filed its motion on May 9, 2024, more than six months after the entry of dismissal on September 8, 2023.  Accordingly, its motion is untimely.   Even if timely, the motion has no merit because Gomez Law, APC never substituted in as counsel of record for CRU.  An “attorney” in an action may only be “changed” (1) “[u]pon the consent of both client and attorney, filed with the clerk, or entered upon the minutes; or (2) “[u]pon the order of the court, upon the application of either client or attorney, after notice from one to the other.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 284(1)-(2).)  “[T]he substitution of an attorney of record can only be made in the manner provided in section 284, Code of Civil Procedure.” (See People Ex Rel. Dept. Pub. Works v. Hook (1967) 248 Cal.App.2d 618, 623; Davis v. Rudolph (1947) 80 Cal.App.2d 397, 402.)  Here, there is no evidence establishing that Gomez Law, APC met the requirements under Code Civ. Proc. §§ 284(1)-(2) to take over the representation of CRU.  No “substitution of attorney” was entered by the Clerk appointing Gomez Law, APC as counsel of record for CRU under Code Civ. Proc. § 284(1), and no “order of the court” was obtained to appoint Gomez Law, APC as counsel of record for CRU under Code Civ. Proc. § 284(2).  The following chronology confirms there was no substitution of attorney appointing Gomez Law, APC as counsel for CRU:  (1) On February 14, 2022, Plaintiff Meinhardt signed and filed a Substitution of Attorney to represent himself in “pro per” and take over the case from Schorr Law, APC, the prior counsel in the case (Ex. 1 to Slome Decl.); (2) On March 8, 2022, Gomez Law, APC and Plaintiff Meinhardt signed and filed a Substitution of Attorney to have Gomez Law, APC take over the case and only represent Plaintiff Meinhardt (Ex. 2 to Slome Decl.); (3) On October 10, 2022, Plaintiff Meinhardt signed and filed a Substitution of Attorney to represent himself in “pro per” and take over the case from Gomez Law, APC, his prior counsel in the case (Ex. 4 to Slome Decl.); and (4) On November 23, 2023, Susan M. Murphy, Esq., an attorney at Gomez Law, APC, sent an e-mail confirming that Gomez Law, APC never substituted into the case for CRU and no further pleadings or notices need to be sent to them in the case (Ex. 5 to Slome Decl.).  On these facts, the Court concludes no substitution of attorney was ever signed and filed in the case by Gomez Law, APC to represent CRU.   In sum, CRU’s motion to vacate is untimely, but even if timely, it has no merit because Gomez Law, APC was never counsel for CRU, and therefore, Defendants’ failure to serve Gomez Law, APC with notices of ruling of the two OSCs that eventually resulted in the dismissal of CRU is of no consequence.   CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES Plaintiff Corp. Realty USA, LLC’s motion to vacate dismissal.   DATED: June 4, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B. Moreton, Jr. Judge of the Superior Court
