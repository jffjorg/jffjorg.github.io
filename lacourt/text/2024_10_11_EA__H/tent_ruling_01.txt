Application for Default Judgment and intends to grant the application, but seeks clarification from counsel on one issue before issuing the judgment. Specifically, Plaintiff
has provided the Court with three proposed judgments: (1) a two-page Judicial
Council form JUD-100 proposed judgment received May 31, 2024 at 7:36 p.m.; (2)
a four-page proposed judgment received May 31, 2024 at 7:36 p.m. or (3) a
two-page Judicial Council form JUD-100 proposed judgment received September 10,

(including the most recent proposed judgment) do not include a request for any
injunctive relief, yet Plaintiff addresses injunctive relief in its

hearing.
