Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer of the defendants (PLM Lender Services, Inc. and Secured Income Fund-II, LLC) to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) filed by the plaintiff (Bay Area Development Co.). The SAC alleges causes of action for intentional interference with contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, declaratory relief, unjust enrichment, breach of implied terms of written forbearance, and interference with contract. The Judge finds that the SAC remains uncertain and fails to adequately address or explain how the sale was going to allow the plaintiff to pay the $100,000 forbearance. The Judge also notes that the plaintiff failed to comply with the terms of the forbearance agreement. The demurrer is sustained, and leave to amend is denied.
