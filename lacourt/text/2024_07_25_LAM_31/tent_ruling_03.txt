I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            On April 23, 2024, Plaintiffs Joseph and Evaristo and
Catherine Evaristo, as Trustees of the Evaristo Family Trust Dated May 4, 2016 (“Plaintiffs”)
filed this unlawful detainer action against Defendants Aina Dumlao and Bru
Muller (“Defendants”) for failure to pay rent for the property 3450 N. Cahuenga
Blvd. West, Unit #510, Los Angeles, CA 90068 (the “Property”).  Defendants are self-represented.
 
On May 20, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an Application for Order
to Post.  In support of the Application,
Plaintiffs attached the affidavit of due diligence of its process server attesting
to having made three failed attempts at personal service at the Property on
April 26, 2024, April 27, 2024, and May 1, 2024.  The court granted the Application on the same
day.
 
On June 6, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a Proof of Service of
Summons by Posting pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 415.45.  The Proof of Service states that the summons
was placed on the front door of the Property on May 21, 2024, and was
subsequently mailed to Defendants by certified mail.
 
On June 20, 2024, Defendants filed this Motion to Quash
Service of Summons.
 
Plaintiffs filed an opposition.  No reply was filed.
 
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
            Personal
service may be accomplished by personally delivering a copy of the summons and
complaint to the person to be served.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.10.) 
If a copy of the summons and complaint cannot, with reasonable diligence, be
personally delivered to the person being served, substitute service may be
effected by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the person’s
“dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual
mailing address ... in the presence of ... a person apparently in charge ...
and by thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and complaint by first-class
mail ... to the person to be served at the place where a copy of the summons
and complaint were left.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20, subd. (b).)  
 
A summons in an action for unlawful detainer of real
property may be served by posting if upon affidavit it appears to the
satisfaction of the court in which the action is pending that the party to be
served cannot with reasonable diligence be served in any manner specified in
this article other than publication and that:
 
(1) A
cause of action exists against the party upon whom service is to be made or he
is a necessary or proper party to the action; or
(2) The
party to be served has or claims an interest in real property in this state
that is subject to the jurisdiction of the court or the relief demanded in the
action consists wholly or in part in excluding such party from any interest in
such property.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 415.45, subd. (a).)  The court
shall order the summons to be posted on the premises in a manner most likely to
give actual notice to the party to be served and direct that a copy of the
summons and of the complaint be forthwith mailed by certified mail to such
party at his last known address.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 415.45, subd. (b).) 
 
A defendant must file a motion to quash service of summons
on or before the last day on which the defendant must plead unless the time is
extended by stipulation or by a judge’s order for good case.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a)(1).)  Although the notice of motion must
designate a hearing date not more than 30 days after the notice is filed,
scheduling a hearing date beyond the 30-day time period does not deprive the
court of jurisdiction to consider the merits of the motion.  (Olinick
v. BMB Entertainment (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 1286, 1295-96.) 
 
Filing a proof of service by a registered process server
creates a rebuttable presumption that service was proper.  (American
Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390 (Zara);
Evid. Code, § 647 [“The return of a process server registered pursuant to ...
the Business and Professions Code upon process or notice establishes a
presumption, affecting the burden of producing evidence, of the facts stated in
the return”].)  This evidentiary presumption also applies in unlawful
detainer actions and is “consistent with the purpose of the unlawful detainer
procedure to afford a relatively simple and speedy remedy for specific
landlord-tenant disputes.”  (Palm Property Investments, LLC v. Yadegar
(2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 1419, 1427 (Palm Property).) However, the
presumption only arises if the proof of service complies with the statutory
requirements regarding such proofs.  (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co.
(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1441-42.)  Proof of service of summons may
be impeached by evidence that contradicts it. 
(City of Los Angeles v. Morgan (1951) 105 Cal.App.2d 726,
731.) 
 
When a defendant moves to quash service of summons, the
plaintiff has “the burden of proving the facts that did give the court
jurisdiction, that is the facts requisite to an effective service.”¿  (Coulston v. Cooper (1966) 245
Cal.App.2d 866, 868.) 
 
III.       JUDICIAL
NOTICE
 
            Plaintiffs
request judicial notice of (1) Application and Order to Serve Summons by
Posting for Unlawful Detainer, dated May 20, 2024, (2) Proof of Service of
Summons of Aina Dumlao, dated June 6, 2024, and (3) Proof of Service of Summons
of Bru Muller, dated June 6, 2024.  
 
The unopposed requests are GRANTED.  (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d).)
 
IV.       DISCUSSION
 
            Defendants
are not entitled to an order quashing service of the summons and
complaint.  Filing a proof of service by
a registered process server creates a rebuttable presumption that service was
proper.  (Zara, supra, 199 Cal.App.4th at p. 390; see
also Evid. Code, § 647.)  This
evidentiary presumption also applies in unlawful detainer actions and is
“consistent with the purpose of the unlawful detainer procedure to afford a
relatively simple and speedy remedy for specific landlord-tenant
disputes.”  (Palm Property, supra, 194 Cal.App.4th at p.
1427.) 
 
            Here,
Plaintiffs filed an Application for Order to Post supported by their registered
process server Sam E. Nehoray’s declaration of due diligence.  According to the declaration, Mr. Nehoray
attempted personal service on 4/26/24 at 6:35 p.m., 4/27/24 at 10:14 a.m., and 5/1/24
at 2:48 p.m.  (See Plaintiffs’ Request
for Judicial Notice (RJN) 1.)  Plaintiffs
meet their burden to create a rebuttable presumption that service was proper.
 
            Defendants
attack Mr. Nehoray’s alleged attempts at service.  In support, Defendants explain that they have
a motion-detector doorbell system which captures images of any person who comes
to the door.  (See generally, Dumlao
Decl. and Muller Decl.)  Defendants
attach still images from the dates of Mr. Nehoray’s attempts at service (4/26,
4/27, and 5/1), none of which show Mr. Nehoray’s image.  (See Dumlao Decl. and Muller Decl., Exs.
1-3.)  Defendants further explain Mr.
Nehoray appears in still images taken from their doorbell system on 5/8/24 and
5/21/24, which is how they know Mr. Nehoray did not attempt service on 4/26,
4/27, or 5/1.  (See Dumlao Decl. and
Muller Decl., Exs. 4-5.)  In other words,
Defendants argue that the absence of Mr. Nehoray’s image from the
doorbell system’s daily logs proves that Mr. Nehoray did not attempt service
prior to 5/8 or 5/21.  
 
            The court
is not persuaded by Defendants’ showing. 
Defendants’ argument is predicated on the reliance of a doorbell camera
system.   Defendants do not provide any foundation for
the functionality, reliability, or operation of that system either generally,
or on the days in question.  Moreover,
Plaintiffs offer Mr. Nehoray’s declaration in opposition to the motion wherein
Mr. Nehoray again describes his attempts at service on 4/26, 4/27, and 5/1.  The court finds Mr. Nehoray’s Declaration
credible.  Defendants fail to rebut the
presumption that service was proper.
 
V.        CONCLUSION 
 
Accordingly, the Motion To Quash is DENIED.   
 
Defendants are ordered to file and serve their Answer to the
Complaint within 5 days of the date of this order.
 
Dated:   July 25, 2024
