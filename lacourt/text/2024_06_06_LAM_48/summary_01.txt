Here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively decided to continue the hearing on the motion to seal the trial brief and exhibits. The court finds that the motion does not contain sufficient facts to justify sealing the records. The court also notes that the cross-defendant did not properly lodge the unredacted documents and did not provide a declaration with sufficient facts to justify sealing. The court is inclined to deny the motion, but will continue the hearing to allow the cross-defendant to supplement the motion.
