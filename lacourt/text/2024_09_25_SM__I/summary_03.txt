And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is puzzled by the motion for terminating sanctions filed by the defendant, which was initially dropped from the docket but later reappeared. The judge notes that there is no opposition to the motion, which is unusual given that the defendant appears to be preparing for trial. The judge is unclear why the motion was filed and why it was dropped from the docket, but is aware that the defendant has been ignoring the case and discovery requests in the past.

The judge notes that the defendant has recently retained new counsel and has agreed to be deposed, but that the deposition has not yet been completed. The judge believes that the defendant is no longer ignoring the court's orders and is cooperating with discovery. The judge suggests that the motion for terminating sanctions may be moot, as the events that drove the motion (the need to depose the defendant) are no longer urgent.

The judge proposes to take the matter off the calendar and discuss the issue with the parties.
