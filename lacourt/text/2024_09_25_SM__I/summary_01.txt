And here is a brief English-language summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion for a protective order regarding a judgment debtor's exam and deposition. The judge agrees to impose a presumptive 4-hour limit on the deposition, but warns both parties that the deposition may be shorter or longer than expected. The judge also expects the deposition to be efficient and professional, and notes that the deposition will likely reveal whether Rachel Rechnitz, Jadelle's manager, truly knows nothing about the business or its assets. The judge is concerned about the potential for bad faith and will take appropriate steps if necessary. The judge also grants an ex parte application to extend the liens for a year, pending any opposition from the judgment debtors.
