And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to continue the trial date due to the court's unilateral continuance of the trial date from November 4, 2024 to November 25, 2024. The court recognizes that the defendant has a preplanned trip on November 25, 2024 and will work with the parties to find a mutually convenient date. The judge notes that the court's general rule is not to continue cases, but there is an exception when the court unilaterally moves the trial date. In this case, the court views its own action as its own fault and will make it right by finding an alternative date.
