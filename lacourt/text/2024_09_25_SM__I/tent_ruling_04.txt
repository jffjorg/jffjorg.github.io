 Case Number:  22SMCV01282    Hearing Date:   September 25, 2024    Dept:  I The court generally will not continue cases.  Due to its heavy docket of over 1100 cases,
there simply is not room to do so, even on a showing of reasonable cause,
absent truly compelling circumstances. 
The notion that the MSJ is coming and defendant will not mediate until
that has been heard, and the trial is coming soon, is not enough.  However, there is an exception to the court’s
rule.  Where a trial date has been set
and the court unilaterally moves it to a date that is not workable to the
parties, the court views that as the court’s own fault and the court will do
what it can to make it right.  That is
the situation here.  The matter had been
set for trial on November 4, 2024.  The court,
however, unilaterally continued it on its own motion to November 25, 2024.  Defense counsel has a preplanned trip for
that time.  Given that this is the result
of a unilateral order from the court, the motion will be GRANTED.  The court will work with the parties to find
a mutually convenient (or at least not horribly inconvenient) date.
