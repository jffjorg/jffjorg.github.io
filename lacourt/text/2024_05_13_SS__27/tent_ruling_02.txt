CASE NO./NAME: 19STCV29773 EVELIA S. ALDACO vs
LOS ANGELES COUNTY METROPOL
Moving Party: Defendant Los Angeles County

Responding Party: Plaintiff
Notice: Sufficient 
 
Ruling: MOTION TO COMPEL IME AND REQUESTS FOR
SANCTIONS IS DENIED
 
Legal standard
Pursuant to CCP § 2024.020, "except as
otherwise provided in this section, any party shall be entitled as a matter of
right … to have motions concerning discovery heard on or before the 15th day
before the date initially set for the trial of the action. A continuance or
postponement of the trial date does not operate to reopen discovery
proceedings." When the hearing for a discovery motion is held after the
discovery motion hearing cut-off date, the Court cannot grant a motion to
compel without first deciding on a motion to reopen discovery (Pelton-Shepherd
Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th
1568, 1588.)
 
“The purpose of imposing a time limit on
discovery is to expedite and facilitate trial preparation and to prevent delay.
Without a cutoff date, the parties could tie up each other and the trial court
in discovery and discovery disputes right up to the eve of trial or beyond.
Furthermore, to be effective the cutoff date must be firm or some litigants
will manipulate the proceedings to avoid the cut-off date” (Beverly Hosp. v.
Superior Court (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1289, 1295.)¿ 
 
Background and Discussion
On August 20, 2019,
Plaintiff filed the present car accident claim. On March 17, 2021, Defendant LA
County Metropolitan Transportation Authority filed its answer. On January 11,
2024, Defendant LACMTA served Plaintiff with a notice for an independent
medical examination (IME) scheduled for February 19, 2024. Plaintiff did not
appear at the IME, and Defendant now moves to compel Plaintiff to attend an
IME. No opposition was filed. 
The current
discovery cutoff date was April 9, 2024, and the last date to hear a discovery
motion was April 24, 2024. On April 3, 2024, Defendant filed an ex parte
application, and the trial date was continued from May 9, 2024, to July 9,
2024. However, the Court did not extend the discovery deadline to align with
the new trial date. Defendant's motion is scheduled to be heard on May 13,
2024, well beyond the deadline for hearing a discovery motion. Although the
present motion briefly addresses the trial's continuance, it fails to discuss
the factors necessary to reopen discovery. When the hearing for a discovery motion is held after the discovery
motion hearing cut-off date, the Court cannot grant a motion to compel without
first deciding on a motion to reopen discovery (Pelton-Shepherd Industries,
Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1568, 1588.)
 
Regarding the issue of sanctions,
monetary sanctions are denied because Defendant did not file a meritorious
motion. Evidentiary sanctions are also denied, as Defendant failed to
demonstrate that Defendant had prior violations of court orders where lesser
sanctions would be ineffective to induce compliance. (R.S. Creative, Inc. v.
Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.)
Therefore, the present
motion and requests for sanctions are denied.
