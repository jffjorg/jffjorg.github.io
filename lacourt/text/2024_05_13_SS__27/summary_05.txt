Here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to respond to Defendant's Requests for Production, Set One, and Requests for Admissions, Set One. As a result, the Court grants Defendant's motion to compel initial responses to its Requests for Production, Set One, and deems the content of its Requests for Admissions, Set One, admitted. The Court also grants Defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $870, which is reasonable for the two motions. The Court orders Plaintiff to pay sanctions of $870 to Defendant within 20 days of today's date.
