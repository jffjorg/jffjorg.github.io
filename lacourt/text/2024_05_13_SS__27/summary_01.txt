```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees and sanctions, finding that the defendant's motion for summary judgment was not frivolous. The court granted summary adjudication to the dangerous condition cause of action, which suggests that the motion was not without merit. The plaintiff argues that the defendant's motion was made in bad faith to force a settlement or waste the court's time, but the court disagrees. The court also finds that the plaintiff's request for sanctions is frivolous, as it is based on an objection to alleged hearsay evidence that has already been overruled.
