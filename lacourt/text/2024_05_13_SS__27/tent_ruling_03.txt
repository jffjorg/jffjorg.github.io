Background 
 
Law Firm Kelly,

breach in material term of the retainer agreement and that Defendant has been
dissolved through bankruptcy. No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard¿ 
¿ 
The Court has discretion to allow
an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that
there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process
of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.) 
¿ 
A motion to be relieved as counsel
must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion),
MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the
client and on all parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).) 
¿
Analysis and Conclusion¿ 
 
Kelly, Trotter
& Franzen has filed Judicial Council Form MC-051
(Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed
Order). Kelly,
Trotter & Franzen seeks to be relieved as counsel for Defendant
the grounds that there has been a material breach of the retainer agreement,
which the Court finds to be proper grounds for withdrawal.
 
The Court notes that the next
hearing is an FSC set for 7/26/24, which should be sufficient time for Defendant to
retain new counsel. Alternatively, if Defendant or new counsel needs additional
time to prepare for trial, sufficient time exists for Plaintiff to take action
to seek a continuance of the trial. Thus, the present motion to be relieved as
counsel is GRANTED effective upon service on Defendant.
