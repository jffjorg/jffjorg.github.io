```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses two motions: a motion to compel further responses to discovery and a motion to compel deposition. The court denies the motion to compel further responses because the parties have not participated in an Informal Discovery Conference to resolve outstanding discovery disputes. The court grants the motion to compel deposition because the defendant failed to appear for the deposition and did not file an opposition to the deposition notice. The court also orders the defendant to pay sanctions of $1000 to the plaintiff.
