CASE NO./NAME: 23STCV02001 BRYSON
PHINALI ARRINGTON vs SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS COMPANY
Moving Party: Plaintiff’s Counsel
Jonathan Chun
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient
 
Ruling: MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS
COUNSEL IS GRANTED.
 
Background
 
Attorney Jonathan Chun represents
Plaintiff. Chun moves to be relieved as counsel, citing an irremediable
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
The Court has discretion to allow
an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that
there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process
of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.)
 
A motion to be relieved as counsel
must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion),
MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the
client and on all parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).)
 
Analysis and Conclusion
 
Chun has filed Judicial Council
Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order). Chun seeks to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff on the
grounds that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.
The Court finds this to be proper grounds for withdrawal. (See Estate of
Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014 (a breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship is grounds for allowing the attorney to withdraw).)
 
The Court notes that the next
hearing is an FSC set for 10/21/24, which should be sufficient time for Plaintiff to
retain new counsel. Alternatively, if Plaintiff or new counsel needs additional
time to prepare for trial, sufficient time exists for Plaintiff to take action
to seek a continuance of the trial. Thus, the present motion to be relieved as
counsel is GRANTED effective upon service on Plaintiff.
