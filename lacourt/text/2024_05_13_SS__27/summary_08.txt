And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has denied the Plaintiff's motion to compel discovery responses and granted the Plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $1500. The Plaintiff had propounded Form Interrogatories (Set One) on the Defendant, but the Defendant failed to provide responses, despite multiple extensions granted by the Plaintiff. The Court found that the Defendant's counsel's argument that the Plaintiff should have provided a longer extension did not constitute substantial justification. Therefore, the Defendant is ordered to pay the Plaintiff $1500 in sanctions. The Court also noted that the Plaintiff is not obligated to provide extensions and may move to compel discovery responses immediately after the deadline has passed.
