And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the Defendant's motion to compel an independent medical examination (IME) and requests for sanctions. The Defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, filed a motion to compel the Plaintiff, Evelia S. Aldaco, to attend an IME, as she failed to appear at a previously scheduled IME. The judge ruled that the motion was filed too late, as the discovery cutoff date had already passed, and the court cannot grant a motion to compel without first deciding on a motion to reopen discovery. The judge also denied the Defendant's request for monetary and evidentiary sanctions, as the Defendant did not demonstrate that the Plaintiff had prior violations of court orders.
