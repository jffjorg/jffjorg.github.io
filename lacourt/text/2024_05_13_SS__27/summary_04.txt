And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has granted Defendant Run D. Wu's motion for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff Esmeralda Y. Fuentes-Perez. The Plaintiff has consistently failed to comply with the Court's orders to provide discovery responses and pay discovery sanctions, misusing the discovery process. Despite efforts to meet and confer with the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff still has not complied with the Court's orders. The Court has previously ordered monetary sanctions, but they have not been paid, and the color photographs have not been produced. The Court finds that lesser sanctions are not appropriate in this case.
