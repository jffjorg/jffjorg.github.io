Tentative ruling: Motion to quash – Denied.  The declarations of defendants are insufficient to overcome the presumption in favor of the declaration by the registered process server.  For instance, neither defendant indicated if they know these addresses, if they had ever lived there, if a friend or relative lives there, whether they ever visit there, how did they become aware of the lawsuit if they were not served, and other relevant facts.  Finally, individuals can be served anywhere they can be personally found.  Personal service is not restricted to home or work.  Defendants shall respond to the complaint within 30 days.
Clerk to give notice.
