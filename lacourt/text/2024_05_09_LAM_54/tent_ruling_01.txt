BACKGROUND
                
On February 7, 2023, Plaintiffs A-Ju Realty, Inc. and Yun Sam Chung
filed the operative first amended complaint against Defendants Kee Whan Ha,
Hannam Chain U.S.A., Inc., Jung Wan Koo, 1000 South Vermont, LLC and Newkoa,
LLC, asserting 12 causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud,
conversion, accounting and intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
 
Plaintiff A-Ju Realty, Inc. was a 22.5% member of Defendant 1000 South
Vermont, LLC, which owned certain real property in Koreatown, Los Angeles.
Plaintiffs allege Defendant Ha, the manager of Vermont, represented that
Vermont was going to develop the property and would require significant capital
investment from Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs were not able to provide additional
capital and instead agreed to a buyout of A-Ju’s 22.5% interest in Vermont for
$3,000,000.00. Plaintiffs allege Defendants did not actually intend to develop
the property, but rather intended to sell the property to a developer, which it
later did for $40,000,000.00. Plaintiffs allege Defendants made these
misrepresentations to induce Plaintiffs to sell the membership interest in
Vermont and keep the profits of the sale for themselves.
 
ANALYSIS
 
CCP § 1987.1 provides, “[i]f a subpoena
requires the attendance of a witness or the production of books, documents,
electronically stored information, or other things before a court, or at the
trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the court, upon
motion reasonably made by any person described in subdivision (b), or upon the
court's own motion after giving counsel notice and an opportunity to be heard,
may make an order quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing
compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as the court shall declare,
including protective orders.”
 
A. Motion to
Enforce Subpoena against Dr. Christopher Kyoon Hee Chung
 
Defendants move to enforce a subpoena for medical records from Plaintiff
Chung’s medical provider Dr. Christopher Kyoon Hee Chung. Defendants served the
subpoena personally on March 9, 2024, with a production date of March 26, 2024.
The subpoena seeks all medical records of Plaintiff Chung. Defendants assert
the information is relevant to Plaintiff’s claims for emotional distress. In
opposition, Plaintiff argues the subpoena is overbroad as to time and scope,
but states Plaintiff will provide a medical authorization to allow Dr. Chung to
produce the records. 
 
As Plaintiff Chung has placed his emotional state at issue, the records
are relevant. Dr. Chung must comply with the subpoena. 
 
Defendant’s motion to enforce subpoena against Dr. Chung is GRANTED.
 
 
 
B. Motion to
Enforce Subpoena against Joo Hee Chung
 
Defendants move to enforce a subpoena for deposition and production of
documents on Plaintiff Chung’s ex-wife Joo Hee Chung. The subpoena seeks all
medical records pertaining to Plaintiff, records of Plaintiff’s depression and
bipolar disorder and all tax returns from 2011 to 2019. Defendants assert this
information and information about Plaintiff’s divorce is relevant to
Plaintiff’s claims for IIED and NIED. In opposition, Plaintiffs assert these
requests are overbroad and harassing and seek privileged (by the tax privilege
and martial communication privilege) information. Plaintiffs represent that
they have offered to produce Ms. Chung for deposition on May 13, 2024. 
 
The Court will not enforce the subpoena as written. Though Plaintiff has
placed his emotional state at issue in this action, seeking medical and tax
records from his ex-wife is unnecessary to conduct this litigation.
Additionally, Plaintiff has agreed to produce Ms. Chung for deposition. 
 
Defendant’s motion to enforce subpoena against Joo Hee Chung is DENIED.

Motion to Seal
Moving Party: Plaintiffs
A-Ju Realty, Inc. and Yun Sam Chung
Responding
Party: Defendants Kee Whan Ha, Hannam Chain USA Inc., Jeong Wan Koo, 1000
South Vermont, LLC and Newkoa, LLC
 
T/R:      PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO SEAL IS DENIED.
 
PLAINTIFFS TO NOTICE. 
 
If the parties
wish to submit on the tentative, please email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with notice to opposing
counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
 
The Court considers the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
 
“The court may order that a record be
filed under seal only if it expressly finds facts that establish: (1) There
exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the
record; (2) The overriding interest supports sealing the record; (3) A
substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced
if the record is not sealed; (4) The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and
(5) No less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.”  (CRC Rule 2.550(d).)  “The motion or application must be
accompanied by a memorandum and a declaration containing facts sufficient to
justify the sealing.”  (CRC Rule
2.551(b)(1).)  
 
Plaintiffs move to seal Exhibit B attached to the previously-filed April 8, 2024 Declaration of
Gerald S. Ohn, which was submitted by Defendants Kee Whan Ha, Hannam Chain
U.S.A. Inc., Jeong Wan Koo, 1000 South Vermont, LLC, and Newkoa, LLC
(collectively the “Ha Defendants”) in support of their Opposition to Plaintiffs’
Motion in Limine No. 1, as well as any portion of the Opposition that discusses
the contents of Exhibit B.
 
Plaintiffs assert the exhibit, a filing in Plaintiff Chung’s divorce,
contains private financial information that must be sealed. In opposition,
Defendants assert that sealing is inappropriate because this document has been
part of the public record of Plaintiff’s divorce proceedings since 2019. The
Court agrees. This document has already been a part of public record for five
years. Any claims of confidentiality or privacy are moot.
 
Plaintiffs’ motion to seal is DENIED.

BACKGROUND
                
On February 7, 2023, Plaintiffs A-Ju Realty, Inc. and Yun Sam Chung
filed the operative first amended complaint against Defendants Kee Whan Ha,
Hannam Chain U.S.A., Inc., Jung Wan Koo, 1000 South Vermont, LLC and Newkoa,
LLC, asserting 12 causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud,

ANALYSIS
 
A. Motion to
Compel Further Deposition Testimony
 
“If a deponent fails to answer any question or to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing under the deponent's
control that is specified in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena,
the party seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling that
answer or production.” (CCP § 2025.480(a); see Stewart v. Colonial Western
Agency, Inc. (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1015 n. 3 [the only proper basis
to instruct a deponent to not answer a question is an objection based upon a
privilege or manifestly irrelevant questions or questions designed only to
harass.]) “If the court determines that the answer or production sought is
subject to discovery, it shall order that the answer be given or the production
be made on the resumption of the deposition.” (CCP § 2025.480(i).) “This motion
shall be made no later than 60 days after the completion of the record of the
deposition, and shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration.” (CCP § 2025.480(b).)  
 
Defendants move to compel further deposition answers from Plaintiff on his
financial condition, emotional condition, and valuation of his shares of 1000
South Vermont as stated in his divorce financial disclosures. In opposition,
Plaintiff asserts this information is irrelevant and private. The Court
disagrees. Plaintiff has placed his financial condition, emotional condition,
and valuation at issue in this action. Further responses are necessary. 
 
Defendants’ motion is GRANTED. The Court declines to award sanctions as
Plaintiff claims Defendants failed to meet and confer. 
 
B. Motion to
Compel Medical Record Authorization
 
Defendants move to compel Plaintiff to provide a medical record
authorization for records from Dr. Christopher
Kyoon Hee Chung. Defendants
provide no authority, and the Court knows of no authority, that allows the
Court to order Plaintiff to sign a medical authorization. 
 
Defendants’ motion to compel medical record authorization is DENIED.
