And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in response to the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to a request for production of documents. The plaintiff, Cesar Yanez, is seeking documents related to his Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act claims arising from his purchase of a 2021 Ford F-150. The defendant, Ford Motor Company, has produced some documents, but the plaintiff claims they are inadequate.

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion and ordered the defendant to serve supplemental responses. The defendant is required to produce documents such as warranty policies and procedures, internal analyses and communications regarding similar defects, and customer complaints. The court has also denied both parties' requests for sanctions.

The court notes that the defendant's offer to produce documents consistent with Judge Hofer's discovery addendum was adequate, but the plaintiff failed to respond to this offer. The court has given the defendant 20 days to produce the requested documents.
