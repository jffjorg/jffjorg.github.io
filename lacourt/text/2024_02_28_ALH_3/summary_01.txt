The judge also noted that the proof of service showed that the summons and complaint were served on "John Doe" at a business address, which may not be the defendant's actual address. The judge gave the parties notice that they may submit on the tentative, and that if they do not appear at the hearing, the opposing party may still appear and argue the matter.
