          Petitioner
Forward Financing LLC requests the Court confirm an arbitration award made on
July 12, 2023 and enter judgment against respondents Mass Exclusive LLC dba
Mass Exclusive (“Mass Exclusive”) and Felix Parker (“Parker”) (collectively,
“Respondents”). Respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay a total of
$167,223.95, consisting of $164,640 in damages, $183.95 in costs, and $5,300 in
administrative fees. 
If a petition or response requesting
confirmation is duly filed and served, the court must confirm the award as
made, unless it corrects or vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1286; see Horn v. Gurewitz (1968) 261 Cal.App.2d
255, 258; Pacific Law Group: U.S.A. v. Gibson (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 577,
580.) A party seeking confirmation of an arbitration award must provide at
least 10 days’ notice to all parties of the hearing date on the petition
seeking to confirm the arbitration award. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.2 [“[a]
petition under this title shall be heard in a summary way in the manner and
upon the notice provided by law for the making and hearing of motions, except
that not less than 10 days’ notice of the date set for the hearing on the
petition shall be given”].) Further, a party seeking confirmation of an
arbitration award must serve and file the petition seeking confirmation at
least 10 days, but not later than 4 years, after the date of service of the
arbitration award upon him or her.  (Id.,
§§ 1288, 1288.4.) The contents of a petition to confirm an arbitration award
shall set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement to
arbitrate, the names of the arbitrators, and shall set forth or have attached a
copy of the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.) 
The hearing was previously continued to
allow Petitioner time to serve Mass Exclusive with the Petition and give notice
of this hearing. Petitioner served Mass Exclusive on September 7, 2023. No
opposition to this Petition was filed. The petition appropriately includes a
copy of the award and written opinion of the arbitrator dated July 17, 2923. Accordingly,
the petition is timely and GRANTED.
