Lateral Link
Group, Inc. v. Gerard Fox Law P.C., Case No. 22SMCV02363
Hearing Date
September 29, 2023 
Plaintiff Lateral
Link Group’s Motion for Summary Judgment (UNOPPOSED) 
 
Attorney
recruiting firm plaintiff Lateral Link alleges defendant Gerard Fox Law failed
to pay fees incurred and moves for summary judgment. The motion is not opposed.

 
A plaintiff
fulfills his or her initial burden on summary adjudication or judgment by
proving each element of the relevant cause of action. Cal. Code of Civ. Proc.
§437c(p)(1). The burden then shifts to defendant to show a genuine issue of
fact as to one or more elements or an affirmative defense. Aguilar v.
Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 849. 
 
Lateral Link
contracted with Gerard Fox to find an attorney for employment, place a
candidate at Gerard Fox, invoiced Gerard Fox for its services, and Gerard Fox
failed to pay. Doustar declaration ¶¶1-7. Lateral Link provides a copy of the
invoice and email exchange with Gerard Fox, which acknowledges the validity of
the invoice and promises to pay. Doustar exhs. 2-3. This is sufficient to carry
Lateral Link’s initial summary judgment burden. Since there is no opposition,
Gerard Fox does not meet its burden, and summary judgment is GRANTED.
