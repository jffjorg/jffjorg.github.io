And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is regarding a motion for summary judgment filed by Lateral Link Group against Gerard Fox Law P.C. Lateral Link Group, an attorney recruiting firm, contracted with Gerard Fox Law P.C. to find an attorney for employment and invoiced them for their services. However, Gerard Fox Law P.C. failed to pay the invoice. To support their motion, Lateral Link Group provided a copy of the invoice and email exchange with Gerard Fox Law P.C., which acknowledges the validity of the invoice and promises to pay. Since there is no opposition to the motion, Lateral Link Group has fulfilled their initial burden to prove each element of the relevant cause of action. As a result, the burden shifts to Gerard Fox Law P.C. to show a genuine issue of fact, but they have failed to do so. Therefore, the court grants summary judgment in favor of Lateral Link Group.
