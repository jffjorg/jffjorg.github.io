Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Barrington Pacific, LLC et al. in two related cases (Tarpinian et. al. v. Barrington Pacific, LLC et al. and Shadpour v. Barrington Pacific, LLC). The cases arise from a fire at apartment buildings owned by Douglas Emmett and managed by Barrington Pacific and Douglas Emmett Management. The residents allege that the defendants failed to provide adequate fire safety precautions, leading to the fire and subsequent displacement, injury, and death of some tenants.

The judge has overruled the demurrer in part, finding that the claims for constructive eviction, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and breach of the implied covenant of habitability are not duplicative and adequately pleaded. The judge has also denied the motion to strike in part, finding that the claims are not embedded in another cause of action.

The judge has granted the motion to strike in part, striking paragraph 95 of the Tarpinian complaint, which references the implied warranty of habitability. However, the judge has denied the motion to strike paragraph 122 of the Tarpinian complaint, which references "habitability issues."

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is in favor of the plaintiffs, allowing their claims to proceed.

## Tentative Ruling Summary:

**Case Number:** 20STCV12200, 20SMCV00370
**Plaintiffs:** Tarpinian, Shadpour
**Defendants:** Barrington Pacific, LLC, Douglas Emmett, Douglas Emmett Management
**Hearing Date:** September 29, 2023
**Department:** P

**Facts:**

* Fire at apartment buildings owned by Douglas Emmett and managed by Barrington Plaza and Douglas Emmett Management.
* Plaintiffs allege defendants failed to provide adequate fire safety precautions, leading to injuries, displacement, and one death.

**Disputes:**

* Barrington demurs to and moves to strike portions of the plaintiffs' amended complaints.

**Arguments:**

* **Constructive Eviction/Quiet Enjoyment:** Barrington argues these claims are duplicative in both cases. The court disagrees, finding distinct injuries are alleged.
* **Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing:** Barrington argues this claim is duplicative of the breach of contract claim in both cases. The court disagrees, finding distinct wrongdoing and injuries.
* **Warranty of Habitability (Shadpour only):** Barrington argues Shadpour failed to comply with a court order to separate the warranty of habitability claim. The court strikes a paragraph referencing the warranty but denies striking another referencing "habitability issues."

**Legal Issues:**

* **Duplication of Claims:** California law allows demurrers when a claim merely duplicates another.
* **Breach of Contract and Good Faith:**  The implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing can be breached in non-insurance contracts.


**Outcomes:**

* Demurrers OVERRULED.
* Motion to Strike:
    * DENIED as to Tarpinian.
    * GRANTED in part as to Shadpour (striking one paragraph referencing the warranty of habitability).


**Significant Statements:**

* "A demurrer may be sustained as to a cause of action that adds nothing to the pleading by way of fact or law, but merely duplicates another claim."
*  "All contracts, not just insurance contracts, contain a covenant of good faith and fair dealing."



## English Summary:

The judge reviewed Barrington's arguments to dismiss parts of the plaintiffs' lawsuits (demurrers) and to remove specific phrases from the complaints (motions to strike). 

The judge found Barrington's arguments about the constructive eviction and breach of good faith claims being duplicative were not valid.  

Regarding the warranty of habitability claim (only in Shadpour's case), the judge found that Shadpour did not follow a previous court order to separate this claim. As a result, the judge struck one paragraph referencing the warranty, but allowed another mentioning "habitability issues" to remain.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses the demurrers and motions to strike portions of the third amended complaint (TAC) filed by Shadpour and the fifth amended complaint (FAC) filed by Tarpinian. The court overrules the demurrers to the constructive eviction claims, finding that they are not duplicative of the breach of implied covenant of quiet enjoyment claims. The court also overrules the demurrers to the breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims, finding that they are not duplicative of the breach of contract claims and that all contracts, not just insurance contracts, contain a covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The court denies the motion to strike as to Tarpinian, but grants it in part as to Shadpour, striking the reference to the warranty of habitability in paragraph 95 of the TAC. The court finds that the plaintiffs have adequately pleaded their claims and that the defendants' demurrers and motions to strike are without merit.
