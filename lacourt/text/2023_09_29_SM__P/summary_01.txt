Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer and motion to strike portions of the complaints filed by the defendants, Barrington Pacific, LLC, Douglas Emmett, and Douglas Emmett Management. The complaints were filed by the plaintiffs, Tarpinian and Shadpour, who alleged that the defendants failed to provide adequate fire safety precautions, resulting in a fire that displaced, injured, or killed the tenants.

The judge is analyzing the arguments presented by the parties and has made the following findings:

* The constructive eviction claim in Tarpinian's complaint is not duplicative of the breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment claim, and therefore is not subject to demurrer.
* The constructive eviction claim in Shadpour's complaint is not duplicative of the breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment claim, and therefore is not subject to demurrer.
* The breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim in Tarpinian's complaint is not duplicative of the breach of contract claim, and therefore is not subject to demurrer.
* The breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim in Shadpour's complaint is not duplicative of the breach of contract claim, and therefore is not subject to demurrer.
* The warranty of habitability claim in Shadpour's complaint is not adequately pleaded, and therefore the judge will strike certain paragraphs of the complaint.
* The motion to strike portions of Tarpinian's complaint is denied, as the demurrer was overruled.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on further arguments and evidence presented at the hearing.

**English Summary:**

The judge has tentatively ruled on two lawsuits filed by tenants, Tarpinian and Shadpour, against their landlord, Barrington Pacific, and the property managers, Douglas Emmett and Barrington Plaza, following a fire in their apartment buildings.  

The judge rejected the defendants' attempts to dismiss the tenants' claims for constructive eviction and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. However, the judge did agree to strike a reference to the warranty of habitability from Shadpour's complaint because it wasn't properly pleaded as a separate cause of action.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers and motions to strike filed by Barrington Pacific, LLC et al. (Barrington) in two separate cases, Tarpinian et al. v. Barrington Pacific, LLC et al. and Shadpour v. Barrington Pacific, LLC.

In the Tarpinian case, Barrington demurred to the constructive eviction claim, arguing that it is duplicative of the breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment claim. The judge overruled this demurrer, finding that the two claims allege different injuries and are not duplicative.

In the Shadpour case, Barrington demurred to the constructive eviction claim, arguing that it is duplicative of the breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment claim. The judge overruled this demurrer, finding that the two claims allege different injuries and are not duplicative.

Barrington also argued that the breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim in both cases is duplicative of the breach of contract claim. The judge overruled this demurrer, finding that the two claims allege distinct wrongdoing and distinct injuries, and that the breach of covenant claim is adequately pleaded.

In the Shadpour case, Barrington moved to strike Paragraph 95 of the third amended complaint, which references the warranty of habitability. The judge granted this motion, finding that the reference is to an unpleaded cause of action for breach of the implied warranty of habitability. The judge also granted Barrington's motion to strike Paragraph 122, which references "habitability issues," but only in part, as the reference is not the same as a specific reference to an unpleaded cause of action for breach of the implied warranty of habitability.

The judge denied Barrington's motion to strike in the Tarpinian case, finding that the motion contains no new arguments and simply adopts the arguments raised in the demurrer.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrers and motions to strike in both cases are denied or granted in part, and that the pleadings are adequate to plead the claims alleged by the plaintiffs.

In this tentative ruling, the Judge is addressing the demurrer and motion to strike portions of the complaints filed by the defendants, Barrington Pacific, LLC, Douglas Emmett Management, and Douglas Emmett in the cases of Tarpinian et. al. v. Barrington Pacific, LLC et al., Case No. 20STCV12200 and Shadpour v. Barrington Pacific, LLC, Case No. 20SMCV00370. The cases arise out of a fire at apartment buildings owned by Douglas Emmett and managed by Barrington Plaza and Douglas Emmett Management. The plaintiffs, Tarpinian and Shadpour, allege that the defendants failed to provide adequate fire safety precautions, resulting in a fire that displaced, injured, and in one case killed, tenant plaintiffs. Plaintiffs also allege that the building remained suffused with ash and toxic debris after the fire.

The Judge addresses the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiffs' constructive eviction and quiet enjoyment claims, finding that there is no duplicative pleading. The Judge also addresses the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiffs' breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim, finding that the claims allege distinct wrongdoing and distinct injuries, and are not duplicative. The Judge further addresses the defendants' argument that only insurance companies can be sued for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, stating that this is not the case and breaches of the implied covenant lie in contract rather than tort.

The Judge also addresses the defendants' motion to strike portions of the complaints, specifically the warranty of habitability claim made by Shadpour, finding that the claim was not adequately pleaded. However, the Judge also states that the demurrer should not be used as a tool to excise certain paragraphs, and that the court will address the TAC's references to the warranty of habitability in its analysis of Barrington’s motion to strike portions of the Shadpour TAC.

In summary, the Judge has overruled the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiffs' constructive eviction and quiet enjoyment claims and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim. The Judge has also granted in part the defendants' motion to strike the warranty of habitability claim made by Shadpour.
