And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is in response to Defendant Zhengdong Tian's motion for sanctions against Plaintiff Y. Jessie Shaw. The motion seeks terminating sanctions, dismissal of the lawsuit, and other relief based on various grounds, including alleged frivolity, res judicata, improper service, and unprofessional conduct by Plaintiff Shaw. The Court finds that the motion lacks merit and is denied. The Court notes that the motion fails to include a proper "notice of hearing" and that the Defendant's challenges to service and venue are not properly brought in this motion. The Court also finds that the Defendant's claims against Plaintiff Shaw should be brought as a cross-complaint or a new action, and that the Court does not have jurisdiction to impose the extreme relief sought by Defendant Tian.
