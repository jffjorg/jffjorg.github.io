 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Demurrer by
  Defendant City of Los Angeles to Complaint.



 
Background
Plaintiff Genevieve H. Wong (Wong) sues
Defendant the City of Los Angeles (the
City) and Does 1 through 40 pursuant to a May 16, 2023 Complaint alleging
claims of (1) Inverse Condemnation, (2) Dangerous Condition of Public Property,
(3) Trespass, and (4) Nuisance.
The claims arise from allegations
that Plaintiff has owned, possessed, and resided at 2057 N. Sunset Plaza Drive,
Los Angeles, California 90069 (the Property) and that the City owned,
constructed, operated, or maintained Sunset Plaza Drive generally. The
Complaint alleges that the Property has been destabilized, damaged, and taken
by continuous water drainage, intrusion, landsliding, subsidence, erosion,
debris flow, and other earth movement caused by a public project, namely the
construction and maintenance of Sunset Plaza Drive. Specifically, the Complaint
alleges that Sunset Plaza Drive collects and diverts drainage from “a large
watershed area to the Wong Property” and that the City’s street and curbs carry
storm water to the Wong Property, which, during heavy rain, causes the drainage
from Sunset Plaza Drive to converge in a whirlpool that attacks the Wong
Property with violent ferocity, putting Plaintiff Wong at risk of her safety
every time it rains. The Complaint also alleges that the water drainage has
destabilized and damaged the Wong Property and is a substantial contributing
cause of water intrusion, landsliding, subsidence, erosion, debris flow, and
other earth movement at the Wong Property, resulting in severe damage to the
Wong Property, including but not limited to undermining the residence on the
Wong Property, continuous flooding, and the cracking, settlement, and tilting
of the improvements on the Wong Property, as well as creating a large erosion
gully on the Wong Property and damaging the foundation of Plaintiff Wong’s
residence. The Complaint alleges that these circumstances have resulted in a
taking of the Wong Property, as well as damages, which include but are not
limited to: a substantially diminished value of the Wong Property; reduced or
destroyed safety and marketability of the Wong Property; the expense of
stabilizing the landsliding and erosion on the Wong Property; out-of-pocket
costs to attempt to mitigate the damage and repair improvements on the Wong
Property; costs of relocation, temporary housing, storage, and increased
insurance premiums; costs for engineers and geologists to analyze the earth
movement danger; and the expense of attorneys and expert consultants to bring
this lawsuit.
On August 7, 2023, the City
demurred to the Complaint’s second and third causes of action based on
sufficiency of pleading. The demurrer was set for hearing on November 6, 2023.
On October 18, 2023, Plaintiff Wong
filed a stipulation by the parties to continue the hearing on the demurrer.
On October 19, 2023, the Court
signed the stipulation, continuing the hearing on the City’s demurrer to
December 15, 2023.
On December 4, 2023, Plaintiff Wong
opposed the demurrer.
On December 8, 2023, the City
replied to the opposition.
The City’s demurrer is now before
the Court.

Sufficiency Standard
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (e).) This device can be used only to challenge defects that
appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the
pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.) To sufficiently allege a cause of action, a complaint must
allege all the ultimate facts—that is, the facts needed to establish each
element of the cause of action pleaded. (Committee on Children’s Television,
Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 212, superseded by
statute as stated in Branick v. Downey Savings & Loan Assn. (2006)
39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) Thus, “[t]o survive a [general] demurrer, the complaint
need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary
fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be
alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53
Cal.4th 861, 872.) In testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the
demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v.
Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) A demurrer, however,
“does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar
v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) When considering demurrers,
courts read the allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228,
disapproved on other grounds, Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership
(2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) The face of the complaint includes exhibits
attached to the complaint. (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d
91, 94.) If facts appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the facts
in the exhibits take precedence. (Holland v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc.
(2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, superseded by statute on other grounds as
stated in White v. Cridlebaugh (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 506, 521.)
I.
Complaint,
Second and Third Causes of Action [Dangerous Condition on Public Property and
Trespass]: SUSTAINED, with leave to amend.
The
City demurs to the Complaint’s second and third causes of action on the ground
that, because the City is a public entity, the Dangerous Condition on Public
Property and Trespass claims must, pursuant to Government Code sections 815 and
815.6, be alleged pursuant to a specific statute or regulation creating a
mandatory duty to avoid the harm alleged, which these claims fail to do.
(Demurrer, pp. 5-9.)
In
opposition, Plaintiff Wong argues that the Dangerous Condition on Public
Property claim need not satisfy Government Code section 815.6 because it relies
on Government Code section 835, foreclosing the need to satisfy the
requirements of section 815.6. Plaintiff Wong also argues that her Trespass
claim relies on constitutional inverse condemnation grounds, for which reason
the claim lies outside of the Government Claims Act (GCA)—including Government
Code section 815.6. (Opp’n, pp. 2-3, 4-10.)
In
reply, the City argues that a trespass claim is a tort claim under cited
authority, for which reason the third cause of action needs to rely on a
specific statute, which it fails to do. The City also argues that the Dangerous
Condition on Public Property claim must similarly rely on statutory authority
to be sufficiently stated against a public entity and that Plaintiff’s four
authorities to the contrary are inapposite.
A. Dangerous Condition on Public Property
The
Court finds in favor of the City.
Nowhere
in the Complaint is Government Code section 835 mentioned. (See Complaint, ¶¶
1-33 [only citing Code Civ. Proc., § 1036, Civ. Code, §§ 3479-3503, and Gov.
Code, § 900, et al.].) The Court therefore need not address Government Code
section 835 insofar as it is not presently pleaded as a statutory authority under
which any claim is being brought.
As
pleaded, therefore, the Court agrees that the Dangerous Condition on Public
Property claim does not rely on a statutory authority to allege liability
against the City, a public entity that can only be held liable in conformity
with the GCA, including Government Code section 815. That statute provides that
“[e]xcept as otherwise provided by statute,” “(a) [a] public entity is not
liable for an injury, whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of
the public entity or a public employee or any other person.” (Gov. Code, § 815,
subd. (a).) A review of the second cause of action fails to show such a
statute. (Complaint, ¶¶ 1-13 [incorporated allegations], 14-21 [second cause of
action].)
The
City’s demurrer is thus SUSTAINED as to the Complaint’s second cause of action,
with leave to amend.
B. Trespass
The
Court finds in favor of the City.
Trespass
is a common law cause of action. (See Gallin v. Poulou (1956) 140
Cal.App.2d 638, 641; see also Odello Bros v. County of Monterrey (1998)
63 Cal.App.4th 778, 793 [“Unlike the inverse condemnation claim, which is based
upon the Constitution and therefore not subject to the immunities set forth
within section 820.2, appellants’ trespass cause of action is a tort claim”].) Neither
is trespass codified in a civil statute. Thus, because the City is a public
entity, it is immune from plaintiff’s trespass cause of action provided that
the claim does not rely on supporting statutory authority. (See Gov. Code § 815,
subd. (a).) The Complaint fails to allege such statutory authority, which
results in the third cause of action being insufficiently alleged.
The
City’s demurrer is thus SUSTAINED as to the Complaint’s third cause of action,
with leave to amend. 

Conclusion
Demurrer by Defendant City of Los
Angeles to Complaint is SUSTAINED, with leave to amend. Plaintiff shall file a
First Amended Complaint within 20 calendar days.
