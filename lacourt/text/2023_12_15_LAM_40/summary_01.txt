Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on Western Union's motion for summary adjudication of its fifth cause of action (Conversion) against Defendant Jeong Hoon Kang aka John Hoon Kang, Jonathan H. Kang, and Jon H. Kang, individually and dba Aloha Deli Market. The court has denied the motion without prejudice.

Western Union alleges that Kelly Kang, individually and dba Aloha Deli Market, converted $98,760.17 of Western Union's funds by taking, keeping, and converting the money to which she knew she was not entitled. The court finds that the admissions deemed admitted against Defendants Jeong Hoon Kang and Kelly Kang are critical to establishing the conversion of the funds.

However, the court notes that the motion relies on admissions deemed admitted against Defendants Jeong Hoon Kang and Kelly Kang, but no evidence is before the court to show those admissions were actually deemed admitted. The court also finds that the separate statement does not reference the Agency Agreement and Guaranty Agreements attached as exhibits to the Badillo declaration, making those "facts" irrelevant for summary adjudication purposes.

As such, the court has denied Western Union's motion for summary adjudication without prejudice.
