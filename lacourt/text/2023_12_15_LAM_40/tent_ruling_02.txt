 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant Zhengdong
  Tian’s Motion for Sanctions.



 
Background
Plaintiff Y. Jessie Shaw dba Law Office of Y. Jessie Shaw—in pro per—sues
Defendant Zhengdong Tian—also in pro per—and Does 1 through 5 pursuant to a
December 7, 2022 Complaint alleging claims of (1) Breach of Contract, (2)
Quantum Meruit, and (3) Open Book Account.
The claims arise from allegations
that on or about December 3, 2019, Defendant Tian entered into a written
agreement with Plaintiff Shaw for Plaintiff Shaw to represent Defendant Tian in
his marital dissolution action, pursuant to which agreement Defendant Tian
would pay Plaintiff Shaw $350 per hour, and that, despite this agreement,
Defendant Tian has failed to pay Plaintiff $40,665.15 in owed legal fees.
On May 10, 2023, Defendant Tian
moved for sanctions against Plaintiff Shaw. Specifically, Defendant Tian seeks
“costs and expenses incurred by … Tian in defending against this … lawsuit,”
“such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper,”
that the “complaint … be dismissed with prejudice,” and an order “barring
[P]laintiff [Shaw] as an attorney from practicing law.”
On June 30, 2023, Plaintiff Shaw
opposed the motion.
Defendant Tian has failed to reply
to the opposition.
Defendant Tian’s motion is now
before the Court.
 
Motion for Sanctions
Legal
Standard
Although
it is unclear precisely under which statute Defendant is proceeding, the Court
interprets it as requesting, among other things, terminating sanctions. Terminating
sanctions are drastic sanctions that should be imposed sparingly and only when
it is clear that the party to be sanctioned has left no viable alternatives.
(See Dept. of Forestry & Fire. Prot. v. Howell (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th
154, 191, disapproved on other grounds in Presbyterian Camp & Conf.
Ctrs, Inc. v. Superior Court (2021) 12 Cal.5th 493; Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Soc’y (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604.)
The
court should consider the totality of the circumstances before ordering
terminating sanctions, including (1) whether the conduct of the party was
willful, (2) the detriment to the party propounding discovery, and (3) the
number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery. (Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390.) The Court is
not required to find that a party acted in bad faith before imposing
terminating sanctions. (See Creed-21 v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18
Cal.App.5th 690, 703.)
If
terminating sanctions are warranted, the Court may make:
(1)
An order striking all or parts of the pleadings (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,
subd. (d)(1); Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967,
992; Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1519 [trial
court struck defendant’s answer]);
(2)
An order staying proceedings until a party obeys a discovery order (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d)(2); Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc., supra,
174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992);
(3)
An order dismissing all or part of a party’s action (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.030, subd. (d)(3); Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc., supra,
174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992; see, e.g., Crawford v. JPMorgan Chase Bank
(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1265, 1271 [dismissal proper when party threatened to
use pepper spray and taser on opposing counsel at deposition and was openly
contemptuous of trial court]); and
(4)
An order rendering a default judgment against a party (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.030, subd. (d)(4); Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc., supra,
174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992; see, e.g., Electronic Funds Solutions, LLC v.
Murphy (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1183-1184 [defendant’s pervasive and
consistent misuse of discovery process supported court’s dismissal of answer
and entry of default judgment]; but see Nickell v. Matlock (2012) 206
Cal.App.4th 934, 943-944 [Code Civ. Proc., § 764.010 prohibits court from rendering
judgment by default as discovery sanction in quiet title actions]).
Although
Defendant also refers to Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7, that statute
requires that a motion brought under that section be separate from any other
motion or request and that the motion shall not be filed with the court unless,
within 20 days after service on the opposing party, the challenged claim,
defense contention, allegation, or denial is not withdrawn or appropriately
corrected. (Code Civ. Proc. § 128.7 subd. (c)(1).)
Order
Granting Terminating Sanctions: DENIED.
Defendant
Tian seeks terminating sanctions and other relief based on various grounds.
These include arguments that this lawsuit is frivolous because Plaintiff Shaw
orally agreed to limit fees to $50,000, all but $5,400 of which have been paid,
and that res judicata bars this lawsuit because Plaintiff Shaw agreed to
$50,000 in fees in the divorce proceedings that underlie this lawsuit. Defendant
Tian also argues that the Complaint was served beyond the 60-day deadline set
by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1110, subdivision (b), making the lawsuit
improper. Moreover, Defendant Tian argues that he was improperly served in this
action, first by substituted service on his 16-year-old son, and then by
substituted service at a place of business not tied to Defendant Tian.
Defendant Tian otherwise argues that Plaintiff Shaw has engaged in
unprofessional behavior, including making false statements relating to proper
venue, making sexual advances toward Defendant Tian, making up lies about the parties’
contractual obligations relating to representation in the underlying divorce
proceedings, and refusing payment for marketing consulting services by
Defendant Tian on behalf of Plaintiff Shaw (framed by the opposition as a Yelp
review and nothing more). Other unprofessional conduct by Plaintiff Shaw
allegedly includes making Defendant Tian work, in effect, as a paralegal in his
own defense in the divorce proceedings, as well as forcing Defendant Tian to
give Plaintiff Shaw a five-star review. (Mot., pp. 1-5.)
Plaintiff
Shaw’s opposition addresses these arguments in various ways and argues that the
motion should be denied. (Opp’n, pp. 1-7.)
The
Court finds in favor of Plaintiff Shaw. While the Court understands that Defendant
Tian is self-represented, “[a] party proceeding in propria persona ‘is to be treated like any other party and is
entitled to the same, but no greater[,] consideration than other litigants and
attorneys.’” (Rappleyea v. Campbell
(1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 985.)
The
Court initially notes that Defendant Tian’s motion fails to include a proper “notice
of hearing”, as required by the Rules of Court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1112, subd. (a)(1).) This alone could be a basis for denial of this motion.
However, the Court finds this violation to be minor and that there is no
prejudice to the Plaintiff, and so will consider the motion on the merits.
To
the extent that Defendant Tian challenges service—either based on the timing of
service of the Complaint (beyond 60 days) or based on substituted service at a
place of business with no connection to Defendant Tian—a motion to quash is the
appropriate procedural vehicle where the Court would be able to determine that
issue in the first instance; not a motion for sanctions, which assumes that the
underlying alleged misconduct has already been adjudicated by a court to have occurred.
Moreover, as the Defendant filed an Answer on January 4, 2023, well before this
motion was filed, any objection to service has likely been waived. (Roy v.
Superior Court (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 337, 341.)
To
the extent that Defendant Tian challenges venue, a motion for change of venue
is the appropriate procedural vehicle.
To
the extent that Defendant Tian has claims against Plaintiff Shaw—either based
on legal malpractice, sexual harassment, monies owed based on marketing
services, or breach of oral contract in charging more in fees than agreed
to—the proper vehicle for those claims is the filing of a cross-complaint for
compulsory and permissive cross claims or a new action for permissive cross
claims.
To
the extent that Defendant Tian argues that res judicata bars this action, the
proper procedural vehicle is a demurrer on that ground. However, the Court does
not see, based on the record before it, that grounds would exist for such a
finding. While Defendant points to a sentence in the Judgment in which the judge
in the Dissolution action noted that Ms. Shaw’s demand for attorney fees to be
paid by the other side had been reduced from $100,000 to $50,000 (Exhibit B to
the motion, at p. 14), that finding does not constitute an adjudication that
that sum is all that is owed to that attorney from that attorney’s own client.
In
other respects, the Court is not convinced that Plaintiff Shaw has, on the
record before the Court, engaged in unprofessional conduct, where such alleged
unprofessional conduct is not clearly a basis for the terminating sanctions
sought in Defendant Tian’s motion. 
The
Court also notes that a State Bar Court judge is the appropriate arbiter of
whether any lawyer should be disciplined, including by disbarment, with the
California Supreme Court having the final say on the matter. That is not a form
of relief that is within this trial court’s jurisdiction. Moreover, while the
Court understands that the Defendant disputes the amount owed to Plaintiff, the
Court does not see any basis for that extreme relief.
Based
on the above discussion, the Court determines that Defendant Tian’s motion
lacks merit. The motion is accordingly DENIED. 

Conclusion
Defendant Zhengdong Tian’s Motion
for Sanctions is DENIED.
