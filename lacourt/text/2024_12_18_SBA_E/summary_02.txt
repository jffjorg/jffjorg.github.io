```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the Demurrer filed by the defendants, Dennis Thomas, aka Dennis E. Thomas, Sr., and Deno's Automotive, LLC, and has overruled it. The defendants had argued that the plaintiff, Silberpal Holdings, LLC, had not properly stated a claim for unlawful detainer because the terms of the written agreement between the parties were not alleged with specificity. However, the court found that the plaintiff had sufficiently pleaded the terms of the contract, despite not attaching the written agreement to the complaint. The court noted that the defendants had alleged the operative and relevant terms of the agreement in their Form Complaint, and that sections 6e and 6f of the UD-100 form were not required for commercial leases, which this case involves. Therefore, the court found that the plaintiff had complied with the requirements for pleading a written contract.
