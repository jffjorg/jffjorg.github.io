BACKGROUND
 
            On
October 21, 2024, Plaintiff
Silberpal Holdings LLC filed the Complaint against Defendants Dennis Thomas,
Aka Dennis E. Thomas, Sr., And Deno’s Automotive, LLC, alleging a single cause
of action for unlawful detainer.
 
            On November 19, 2024, Defendants
filed the Demurer to the Complaint.
 
            On December 12, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the opposition.
 
            No reply has been filed.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
            A demurrer can be
used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under
attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a demurrer, the complaint
need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary
fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be
alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 
53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of
the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts
properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th
962, 966-967.) A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d
695, 713.) 
 
A pleading is uncertain if it is ambiguous or
unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f).) A demurrer for
uncertainty may lie if the failure to label the parties and claims renders the
complaint so confusing defendant cannot tell what he or she is supposed to
respond to. (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d
135, 139, fn. 2.) However, “[a] demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed,
even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can
be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of
California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) 
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            The
instant case is an unlawful detainer action involving the property at 1050
South La Brea Avenue, Inglewood, CA. Plaintiff seeks, among other things,
forfeiture of the purported lease agreement, and damages, and attorneys’ fees. Defendants
Demur to the Complaint
 
Defendants
contend that Plaintiff has not properly stated a claim for unlawful detainer
because, in actions based on breach of contract, the terms of the contract must
be alleged with specificity. (Code of Civil Procedure §1166 subd. (a)(2).) For
a written contract to be pleaded  with
specificity, it must be pleaded either verbatim, through an attached copy, or
by its legal effect, which requires detailed allegations of its relevant terms (Heritage
Pac. Financial, LLC v. Monroy, (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 993.)
 
Here,
Plaintiff has failed to attach the alleged June 10, 2024, written agreement
between the parties or sufficiently detail its terms. Defendants note that
sections 6e and 6f of the UD-100 form are unchecked, making it unclear why the
agreement is not attached, particularly given that this case involves
commercial property rather than a residential matter. As a result, Defendants
assert that the complaint is vague and must be amended to include the specific
terms of the written agreement and clarify the basis for the claim.
 
Defendants
argue that they clearly alleged the operative and relevant terms of the
agreement in paragraph six of their Form Complaint.
 
            On the From Complaint, Defendant
states that Plaintiff agreed to a fixed term lease at $8,330.00 a month to be
paid on the first of the month. While sections 6e and 6f are unchecked, these
sections are only required for residential leases; as this was a commercial
lease, they are not required. Thus, given that the contract was pleaded as
required by Form UD-100 and Plaintiff stated the material terms of the
contract, the Court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded the terms of
the contract. (See, Heritage Pac. Financial, LLC, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th
972, 993.)
 
            Therefore, the Court overrules the
Demurrer.
