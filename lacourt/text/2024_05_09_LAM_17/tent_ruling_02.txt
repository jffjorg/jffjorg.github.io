 Case Number:  22STCV13457    Hearing Date:   May 9, 2024    Dept:  17 Superior  Court of California County  of Los Angeles   DEPARTMENT 17   TENTATIVE RULING      CBD    FRANCHISING, INC.                                       vs.   CENTRAL    JERSEY DOORS & CLOSETS, LLC       Case No.: 22STCV13457        Hearing    Date:  May 9, 2024     One Day  Defendants’ motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.    Accordingly,  the pending discovery motions are MOOT.     On 4/21/2022,  Plaintiff CBD Franchising, Inc. (Plaintiff or CBD) filed suit against Central  Jersey Doors & Closets, LLC, Mary Conway, William Conway, One Day Doors and  Closets, Inc., and One Day Enterprises, alleging: (1) breach of written  contract; (2) breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing; (3)  tortious interference with contractual relations; and (4) unlawful business  practices.   On 2/9/2024,  One Day Defendants moved for summary judgment, or in the alternative, summary  adjudication, of the third and fourth causes of action.[1]    Evidentiary Objections   CCP section 437c,  subdivision (q) provides: In granting or denying a  motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication, the court need rule only  on those objections to evidence that it deems material to its disposition of  the motion. Objections to evidence that are not ruled on for purposes of the motion  shall be preserved for appellate review.               In  light of CCP section 437c, subdivision (q), the Court declines to rule on any  submitted objections.    Discussion                One  Day Defendants argue they are entitled to summary judgment of the third and fourth  causes of action for tortious interference with contractual relations and  unlawful business practices because: (1) the 2013 Franchise Agreements’  post-term covenant not to compete is unenforceable under Business and  Professions Code section 16600; (2) any reasonable trier of fact would find  that One Day Enterprises did not have knowledge of the 2013 Franchise Agreement  at any time relevant to CBDF’s claims; (3) any reasonable trier of fact would  find that the Conways did not breach the 2013 Franchise Agreement’s post-term  covenant not to compete because the covenant was no longer binding at the time  of their alleged breaches; and (3) any reasonable finder of fact would find  that One Day Doors and Closet, Inc. was an inactive business entity at all  relevant times, such that it is entitled to summary judgment.    I.                    Post-Term Covenant Not to  Compete    Business and  Professions Code section 16600, provides that “every contract by which anyone  is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any  kind is to that extent void.” (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 16600.) Under section  16660, contractual restraints imposed on an individual “after the termination  of employment or the sale of interest in a business” are “invalid without  regard to their reasonableness.” (Ixchel Pharma, LLC v. Biogen, Inc.  (2020) 9 Cal.5th 1130, 1152.) That per se rule of invalidity embodies  California’s “settled legislative policy in favor of open competition and  employee mobility,” which “protects the important legal right of persons to  engage in businesses and occupations of their choosing.” (Edwards v. Arthur  Andersen LLP (2008) 44 Cal.4th 937, 946, citations and quotation marks  omitted.) This rule applies regardless of whether the contractual restraint is  imposed on an individual who is classified as an employee or instead as an  independent contractor: “Thus, an agreement by an employee or independent  contractor not to compete with his employer after leaving that employment is  void.” (Bosley Medical Group v. Abramson (1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 284,  288.)               Here,  Section 13.02 of the 2013 Franchise Agreement purports to prohibit the Conways,  as individuals and independent contractors, from obtaining employment with any  “Competitive Business” located within any CBDF territory, or within 75 miles of  the perimeter of any CBDF territory, for a two-year period following the  termination of the agreement. (SUF 3.)   Under  Sections 1.01 and 13.01 of the 2013 Franchise Agreement, the term “Competitive  Business” includes any business that offers or sells “custom closet services or  products or other customed home organizer services or products” or “custom  closets, custom home and officer organizers, other customized organizer  services and related services and products” (collectively, “Custom Closets”).  (SUF 4.)   Given that  the 2013 Franchise Agreement purports to impose contractual restraints on the  Conways as individuals, rather than on any business entity, One Day Defendants  contend that the covenant not to complete falls squarely within the per se rule  of invalidity because it is a “contract by which [the Conways are] restrained  from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business.” (Bus. & Prof.  Code, § 16600.)   A contractual  restraint “falls outside the confines” of the per se rule of invalidity if “it  does not address an individual’s ability to engage in a profession, trade, or  business.” (Quidel Corporation v. Superior Court of San Diego County  (2020) 57 Cal.App.5th 155, 166.) In other words, contractual restrains imposed  on a business related to “business operations and commercial dealings”,  as opposed to an individual, are only invalid if they are “unreasonable.” (Ixchel,  supra, 9 Cal.5th at p. 1152.) One Day Defendants argue that even if the  covenant not to complete is construed as a restraint on a business, rather than  the Conways as individuals, it is still invalid because it is unreasonable.    In  opposition, CBDF argues: (1) the 2013 Franchise Agreement provides that its  post-term covenant not to compete should be governed by New Jersey law; (2)  section 16600 does not prohibit post-term contractual restraints when they are  included in franchise agreements; and (3) the 2013 Franchise Agreement’s  post-term covenant not to compete falls with an exception created by section  16601 permitting restrictive covenants when a person “sells the goodwill of a  business.”    As for CBDF’s  first contention, California’s courts will not enforce an otherwise binding  choice-of-law provision when the agreement violates California’s fundamental  policy in favor of free competition. (See, e.g., Scott v. Snelling and  Snelling, Inc. (N.D. Cal. 1990) 732 F.Supp. 1034, 1041 [“Therefore, the  Court holds that it should apply California law to the question of the  enforceability of the covenants restricting competition in the franchise  agreements in this case despite the choice of law provision nominating  Pennsylvania law as controlling interpretation of the agreements.”]; Frame  v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1971) 20 Cal.App.3d  668, 673 [same]; Hollingsworth Solderless Terminal Co. v. Turley (9th  Cir. 1980) 622 F.2d 1324, 1338 [same].) As such, the Court declines to analyze  the validity of the non-compete covenant according to New Jersey law.    As for the  second contention, California courts agree that a “post-franchise  anti-competitive provision of [any franchise] agreement violates anti-trust  laws (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 16600).” (Dayton Time Lock Service, Inc. v.  Silent Watchman Corp. (1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 1, 6; see also Kelton v.  Stravinski (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 941, 947 [endorsing Dayton].) As such,  the Court disagrees with the contention that section 16600 does not prohibit  post-term contractual restraints. To the contrary, even in the franchise  context, post-termination covenants not to compete are voided by Section 16600.  (Sonoma Tires, Inc. v. Big O Tires, LLC (N.D. Cal., Jan. 22, 2013, No. C  11-0818 RS)   As for the third  contention, section 16601 has an exception which permits restrictive covenants  when a person “sells the goodwill of a business.” (Bus. & Prof. Code, §  16601.) One Day Defendants argue that the 2013 Franchise Agreement expressly  and repeatedly states that it does not transfer any goodwill. (SUF 6.)    In opposition,  CBDF argues that goodwill was transferred as part of the agreement. In support,  CBDF submitted evidence that the Asset Purchase Agreement explicitly states  that the Conways were selling “substantially all of [the business entity’s]  operating assets together with the goodwill of the business entity.” And, the  Conways agreed that they were transferring “[t]o the extent assignable, all of  Seller's rights, title and interest in and to its customer contracts, telephone  numbers, facsimile numbers, any website and e-mail addresses and URLs  (Universal Resource Locators), licenses, leases, contracts and governmental  authorizations relating to the Business and operations of the Seller, customer  lists and accounts, goodwill and any other assets used in the Business.”  (Egner Decl. ¶ 12, Exs. 5-6, at Section 1.a.(iii), emphasis added.)   In its  initial tentative, the Court concluded there was a triable issue of fact as to  whether or not good will was transferred as part of the agreement. However,  after the hearing on 4/9/2024, the Court concludes otherwise.    As noted by  One Day, the evidence referenced by CBDF refers to the 2016 Asset Purchase  Agreement, not the 2013 Franchise Agreement. The 2013 Franchise Agreement alone  is the basis of CBDF’s claims. CBDF failed to present any evidence that could  show that goodwill was transferred as part of the 2013 Franchise Agreement.  Moreover, CBDF is not a party to the 2016 Asset Purchase Agreement upon which  it relies to show a transference of good will. CBDF did not present any legal  authority which could show that the CBDF could avail itself of a provision in  an agreement to which it was not a party in order to show that the 2013  Franchise Agreement’s non-compete was covered under the section 16601  exemption. (“This failure to cite pertinent legal authority is enough reason to  reject the argument”); Akins v. State of California (1998) 61  Cal.App.4th 1, 50, 71 (contention waived by failure to cite legal authority).   The 2013  Franchise Agreement expressly states: “Following the termination or expiration  of this agreement, no monetary amount will be attributable to any goodwill  associated with your use of the proprietary marks or operation of the franchise  business or Closets by Design loan, including any local goodwill.” Later, the  Franchise Agreement expressly states: “You assert and will in the future assert  no claim to any goodwill, reputation, or ownership of the proprietary marks.”    Given the  lack of ambiguity in the contract language, the Court agrees with One Day that  this presents a question of law, rather than a question of fact. There is no  evidence to support an inference that the 2013 Franchise Agreement falls within  the section 16601 exception for goodwill. Accordingly, the Court concludes that  the 2013 Franchise Agreement’s non-compete is unenforceable under Business and  Professions Code section 16600.    Based on the  foregoing, One Day Defendants’ motion for summary judgment is granted.     It is so ordered.    Dated:  May     , 2024                                                                                                                                                                Hon.
