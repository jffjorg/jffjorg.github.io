Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted summary judgment in favor of One Day Defendants, finding that the non-compete clause in the 2013 Franchise Agreement is unenforceable under California Business and Professions Code section 16600. The court concluded that the covenant not to compete is void under section 16600, as it restricts the Conways from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business. The court also found that the covenant is not exempt from the statutory voidage under section 16601, as the 2013 Franchise Agreement does not transfer goodwill as part of the agreement.
