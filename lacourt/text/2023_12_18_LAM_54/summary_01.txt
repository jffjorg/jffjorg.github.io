And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to quash service of summons filed by the parties. Pearl 33 Holdings, LLC's motion to quash is denied, as the court finds that Pearl 33 has sufficient minimum contacts with California to establish specific jurisdiction. Pearl 33's purchase and takeover of Cloud B, a California corporation, establishes a connection to the state, and the court finds that the exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable.

Christopher B. Ferguson's motion to quash is granted, as the court finds that the service of summons was not properly made. The court finds that the Red Hawk address used for service was not Ferguson's "dwelling house," "usual place of abode," "usual place of business," or "usual mailing address," and that there was no diligent attempt to personally serve him.

Phillip McFillin and Kevin Ferguson's motions to quash are denied, as the court finds that they have sufficient minimum contacts with California to establish specific jurisdiction. As members of Cloud B's board of directors, they have purposefully availed themselves of the laws and benefits of California, and the court finds that the exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable.

The court will not determine on a motion to quash whether the action is barred by a settlement agreement. The parties are directed to email the courtroom by 8:00 am on the day of the hearing if they wish to submit on the tentative ruling.
