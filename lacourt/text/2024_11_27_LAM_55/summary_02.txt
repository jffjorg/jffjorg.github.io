Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has sustained Jerry Sorrentino's demurrer to the tenth and eleventh causes of action, which alleged fraud and fraudulent concealment. The judge found that Cross-Complainant failed to properly allege any affirmative misrepresentation with sufficient particularity. The judge also sustained the demurrer to the negligence, conversion, and breach of fiduciary duty claims, finding that Cross-Complainant failed to state a claim.

The judge gave Cross-Complainant 20 days to amend its complaint. The judge also denied the motion to strike punitive damages as moot, since all the tort claims were dismissed.
