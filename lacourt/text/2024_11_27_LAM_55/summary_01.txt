And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Roderick Corprue's motion to consolidate two cases, 20STCV14617 and 24STCV25195. The motion was seen as an untimely motion for reconsideration of the court's previous denial of Plaintiff's motion to file a fourth amended complaint. The judge also found that consolidating the cases would prejudice the defendants, who would have to conduct additional discovery and possibly file additional motions contesting the merits of the new claims. The judge noted that the claims raised in the related case are similar to those previously summarily adjudicated, and that the central new fact distinguishing the claims is the City of Lawndale's formal termination of Plaintiff in May 2024, which is unlikely to result in a different outcome for the race and age discrimination claims.
