Significant Statements: 
  - The Court may, in the furtherance of justice, and upon any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading.
  - Requests for leave to amend generally will be granted unless the party seeking to amend has been dilatory in bringing the proposed amendment before the Court, and the delay in seeking leave to amend will cause prejudice to the opposing party if leave to amend is granted.
  - The decision on a motion for leave is directed to the sound discretion of the trial court.
  - The Court is not certain these documents actually show fraudulent intent from the outset, but they were never addressed in the Opposition, which creates an inference that the amendment is proper.

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to file a fifth amended complaint (5AC) by the plaintiffs, Petros and Karine Taglyan. The plaintiffs seek to add two new causes of action for promissory fraud and constructive trust based on new evidence obtained through discovery. The Defendant, TCA, opposes the motion, arguing that the plaintiffs have been dilatory in bringing the proposed amendment and that the delay will cause prejudice if the motion is granted. The Judge has determined that there would be little prejudice to the Defendant and has granted the motion, allowing the plaintiffs to file the 5AC separately and within 5 days. The Judge will also discuss a potential trial continuance for the purposes of a summary judgment motion.
