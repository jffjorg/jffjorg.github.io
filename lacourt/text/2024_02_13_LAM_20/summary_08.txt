And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling concerns a motion by Defendant Steadfast Insurance Company to seal Exhibit G in support of its motion for summary judgment/adjudication. The court finds that Exhibit G contains material subject to the attorney work product privilege, which is an overriding interest supporting a sealing order. The court grants the motion to seal, as the privilege will be lost if there isn't a sealing order, and the sealing is narrowly tailored to the extent pertaining only to one exhibit.
