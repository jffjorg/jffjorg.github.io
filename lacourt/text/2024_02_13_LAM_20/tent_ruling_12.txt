This is an employment matter.  Plaintiff Selim Hoxha seeks to compel further responses to his special interrogatories, set one, nos. 15, 16, 18, 19, 21-23, 30, 39, 43-48, and 51 propounded on Defendant The Regents of the University of California.Defendant argues that the meet and confer process had not ended given that Defendant stated that it would provide supplemental responses but simply needed more time.Plaintiff contends that his meet and confer effort was sufficient because he had already granted Defendant a multitude of extensions to provide supplemental responses.The Court will rule as it did on February 5, 2024, with regards to Plaintiff’s requests for production: “Given that Defendant is apparently willing to supplement its responses and the trial date is set for June 30, 2025, the Court will deny the Motion without prejudice.  The parties are to further meet and confer.  After supplemental responses are obtained, Plaintiff may renew his Motion to the extent necessary.  The Court declines to award sanctions at this time.” Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
