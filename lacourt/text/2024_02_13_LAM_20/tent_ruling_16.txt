Plaintiff Oakwood Development LP seeks default judgment against Defendant Brian Rivera.The Default Judgment Application is denied without prejudice because:Plaintiff seeks $108.33 in daily rent through December 27, 2023, and the date of entry of judgment, but the premises were apparently re-rented in July 2023 such that it is not apparent why Plaintiff is entitled to such daily rent;Plaintiff requests $26,873 in attorneys’ fees, but the subject lease indicates that in any action to enforce the lease “the parties agree that the reasonable attorney's fees to be awarded shall be $500.00 to the prevailing party in any action or proceeding”; andthe proposed judgment is not totally filled out. Plaintiff to give notice.
