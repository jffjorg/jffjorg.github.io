Defendant Steadfast Insurance Company seeks to seal Exhibit G in support of its motion for summary judgment/adjudication.  Unless confidentiality is required by law, court records are presumed to be open to public review.  (Cal. Rules of Court 2.550(c); see also Cal. Const., art. I, § 3, subd. (b)(1) [“The people have the right of access to information concerning the conduct of the people’s business”].)  “The court may order that a record be filed under seal only if it expressly finds facts that establish: (1) There exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record; (2) The overriding interest supports sealing the record; (3) A substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) No less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550(d); see also NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1217-1218.)The Court finds that the subject exhibit contains material subject to the attorney work product privilege, which is an overriding interest supporting a sealing order; the privilege will be lost if there isn’t a sealing order; the sealing is narrowly tailored to the extent pertaining only to one exhibit; and no less restrictive means exist to preserve the privilege. Therefore, the Motion to Seal is granted.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
