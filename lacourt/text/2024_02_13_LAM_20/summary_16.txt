Judge's Tentative Ruling:

Plaintiff Oakwood Development LP has sought a default judgment against Defendant Brian Rivera. The court has denied the Default Judgment Application without prejudice. The reasons for the denial are as follows: Plaintiff is seeking $108.33 in daily rent from December 27, 2023, to the date of entry of judgment, but the premises were re-rented in July 2023, making it unclear why Plaintiff is entitled to this amount. Additionally, Plaintiff is requesting $26,873 in attorneys' fees, but the lease agreement specifies that reasonable attorney's fees shall be capped at $500.00 for the prevailing party. Finally, the proposed judgment is not fully completed. The court has instructed Plaintiff to provide notice.
