 Case Number:  23STCV00870    Hearing Date:   October 14, 2024    Dept:  78  Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78 ¿ IRMA YBARRA, et al., Plaintiff(s), vs. ALAL, LLC dba KEI-AI LOS ANGELES HEALTHCARE CENTER, et al., Defendant(s). Case No.: 23STCV00870 Hearing Date: October 14, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER (1) GRANTING UNOPPOSED MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY AND (2) GRANTING UNOPPOSED MOTION TO DEEM REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION ADMITTED  I. MOTION TO COMPEL A. Background Defendants ALAL, LLC dba Kei-Ai Los Angeles Healthcare Center, Aspen Skilled Healthcare, and Tanner Mitchell (collectively, “Defendants”) propounded form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and demand for production of documents and things on plaintiffs Irma Ybarra, individually and as the personal representative of the estate of decedent Socorro Franco, and on plaintiff Ruben Franco (collectively, “Plaintiffs”). Plaintiffs served unverified responses and have not served verifications to date. Defendants therefore seek an order compelling Plaintiffs to serve verified responses and to pay sanctions. B. Legal Standard For a motion to compel initial discovery responses, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 906.) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) An unverified response is tantamount to no response at all. (Melendrez v. Superior Court (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1343, 1348.) C. Conclusion & Order Plaintiffs did not oppose the motion. A failure to oppose a motion may be deemed a consent to the granting of the motion. (CRC, rule 8254(c).) Because there is no evidence Plaintiffs have cured the defect by serving verifications, Defendants’ motion to compel initial discovery is GRANTED. Plaintiffs are ordered to serve verifications/verified responses to Defendant’s (1) form interrogatories, set one, (2) special interrogatories, set one, (3) special interrogatories, set two, (4) special interrogatories, set three, and (4) demand for production of documents and things, set one, within twenty (20) days. (CCP §§ 2030.290(a),(b), 2031.300(a),(b).)  II. MOTION TO DEEM REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION ADMITTED Background On May 16, 2023, Plaintiffs served Requests for Admission, set one, on Plaintiffs. After multiple extensions, Plaintiffs served unverified responses on September 20, 2023. After the parties met and conferred, Plaintiffs have yet to serve verifications to date. Legal Standard Under Code of Civil Procedure 2033.280(b), failure to respond to requests for admission in a timely manner allows the requesting party to “move for an order that…the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted” by the party that failed to respond.¿ The requesting party’s motion must be granted by the court, “unless [the court] finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).) Conclusion & Order Because there is no evidence Plaintiffs have served verifications on Defendants prior to the hearing, the unopposed motion to deem admitted the Requests for Admission, Set One, against Plaintiffs is GRANTED. (CCP §2033.280(b).)  III. SANCTIONS Sanctions are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response, unless a court makes certain findings.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c).)¿Plaintiff did not file any opposition. However, sanctions may be awarded, even though no opposition was filed, pursuant to CRC 3.1348(a). Further, it is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion. Defendants request $1,335.00 for the motion to compel initial discovery and $1,335.00 for the motion to deem requests for admission admitted. A court has discretion to award sanctions that are “suitable and necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he seeks” but they should not be punitive in nature or levied for the purposes of punishing an offending party. (Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545.)¿These are simple motions that should not have taken Defendants’ counsel three hours each to prepare and draft. The Court will grant sanctions in a reduced amount. Defendants are awarded 1 hour to prepare each motion and one hour to appear at the hearing (awarded only once), at the requested rate of $255.00 per hour, for a total of $765.00 in attorney fees. Further, Defendants are awarded two motion filing fees of $60.00, for a total of $120.00 as costs. Sanctions are imposed against Plaintiffs and their counsel of record, jointly and severally. Plaintiffs and/or Plaintiffs’ counsel are ordered to pay sanctions to Defendants, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $885.00, within twenty (20) days.  IV. ADDITIONAL FILING FEES The Court notes that Defendants filed a single motion for what should have been three separate motions as to the motions to compel form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and demand for production of documents. Combining discovery motions allows the moving party to avoid paying the requisite filing fees. Filing fees are jurisdictional and it is mandatory for court clerks to demand and receive them. (See Duran v. St. Luke’s Hospital (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 457, 460.) Thus, Defendants are ordered to pay two additional filing fees. This ruling will be final only upon proof of payment of the filing fees.¿  Moving Party is ordered to give notice.  DATED: October 11, 2024 __________________________ Hon. Michelle C.
