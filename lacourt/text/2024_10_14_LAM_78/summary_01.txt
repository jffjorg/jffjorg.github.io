Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to reopen discovery for the purpose of obtaining documents from the defendant. The plaintiff, E.S.E. Electronics, Inc., had filed a motion to reopen discovery in order to obtain copies of bank statements and PayPal statements that the defendant, Elen Navidi, et al., had not produced earlier. The plaintiff claimed that it could not have discovered this earlier because the defendant had provided deceitful responses to its request for production. The defendant, however, argued that the plaintiff's principal and counsel had participated in the dissolution proceedings and were aware of the documents, and that the plaintiff had not been diligent in seeking the bank statements.

The judge found that the plaintiff had not shown diligence in seeking the bank statements and that the trial date would likely be disturbed if discovery was reopened. The judge also noted that the plaintiff had not directly responded to the defendant's contention that the plaintiff's principal and counsel had been aware of the documents and had not sought to subpoena them earlier. Therefore, the judge denied the motion to reopen discovery.
