And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company (Liberty) to set aside a default entered against them due to their willful disregard of discovery orders. The default was a result of the court granting the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions. Liberty claims that their actions were not willful, but rather a mistaken interpretation of the discovery order. The judge initially granted Liberty's motion, but then expressed concern about whether they have jurisdiction to hear the motion since Liberty has filed a notice of appeal from the order imposing terminating sanctions. The judge is now denying the motion without prejudice, stating that the notice of appeal was timely filed and has been perfected. As a result, the court lacks jurisdiction to decide the motion. Liberty may refile the motion if the Court of Appeal dismisses the appeal.
