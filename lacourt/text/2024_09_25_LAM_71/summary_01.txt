And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants defendant William Wirshing, M.D.'s unopposed motion to compel non-party Harbor UCLA Medical Center to comply with a deposition subpoena for the production of business records. The subpoena was issued to obtain records related to the mental state and treatment of decedent Le'Wayne Anthony Wright, which is at issue in the lawsuit. Despite the subpoena being served on August 2, 2024, Harbor UCLA has failed to respond. The judge finds that the subpoena is proper and that the records sought are within the scope of permissible discovery. The judge also notes that the privilege of medical and mental health information gives way when the issues are presented in litigation. Therefore, the judge orders Harbor UCLA to comply with the subpoena.
