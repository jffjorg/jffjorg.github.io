And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Andrea Martinez's motion for summary adjudication as to Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc.'s sixth and seventh affirmative defenses. The dispute is related to a lemon law action regarding a 2019 Honda Pilot purchased on March 19, 2019. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant sold the vehicle knowing there was a transmission defect. The Defendant's sixth affirmative defense claims that it has a third-party dispute resolution process, and the Plaintiff has made no effort to use it. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has met her burden in establishing that the Defendant does not have a "qualified" third-party dispute resolution process under Civil Code section 1793.22. The Defendant's seventh affirmative defense claims that it possesses a "qualified" third-party dispute resolution process, but the Court finds that this process is not qualified under the law. The Court grants the motion for summary adjudication as to both affirmative defenses.
