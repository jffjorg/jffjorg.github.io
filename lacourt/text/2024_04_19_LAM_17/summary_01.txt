And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Plaintiff's motion to have her Requests for Admission deemed admitted. The Judge also denies the Plaintiff's motion to compel responses to her Requests for Production and Special and Form Interrogatories. The Judge declines to award sanctions at this time. The Plaintiff filed suit against the Defendant, alleging breach of implied obligation of good faith and fair dealing and breach of contract. The Defendant served objection-only responses to the Plaintiff's discovery requests, which led to the Plaintiff's motion to compel. The Judge finds that the Defendant did file responses to discovery, albeit objection-only, and that the Plaintiff could have filed a motion to compel further responses instead of pursuing a separate motion. The Judge also disagrees with the Plaintiff's contention that no separate statement was required because the Defendant's responses were unverified.
