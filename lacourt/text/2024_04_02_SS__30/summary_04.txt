And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled on the defendant's demurrer, which argued that the complaint does not state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. The court found that the complaint pleads facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for motor vehicle negligence. The court noted that a plaintiff only needs to allege negligence in general terms, and that the complaint does not need to plead facts beyond the form complaint since the defendant is not a public entity. The court also found that ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures. Therefore, the court overrules the defendant's demurrer.
