And here is the English-text summary:

In this tentative ruling, Judge Ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to form interrogatories as moot, since the defendant has already served unverified responses. The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions, as the motion was not unsuccessfully opposed. The judge notes that the defendant did not provide meaningful response to counsel's communication, but finds that the request for sanctions under CCP section 2023.010 is also denied, as this section does not independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.
