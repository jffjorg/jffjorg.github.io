And here is the English summary:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel an independent medical examination (IME) with psychiatrist Dominick Addario, M.D., on April 19, 2024. The IME is necessary to assess the plaintiff's mental and physical condition, including anxiety, severe emotional distress, traumatic brain injury, and related mental issues. The plaintiff has undergone four prior IMEs, but this one is necessary to determine causation in light of his pre- and post-incident accident and injury history. The plaintiff will also need to undergo future medical treatment, therapy, and medications, which will cost nearly $6 million. The court finds that there is good cause to grant the motion, and the plaintiff is ordered to undergo the IME on the specified date and location.
