 Case Number:  22STCV34102    Hearing Date:   April 2, 2024    Dept:  30 DORIS DIAZ, AN INDIVIDUAL vs SIMON PARK, AN INDIVIDUALTENTATIVEPlaintiff’s motion to compel responses to form interrogatories is DENIED as moot.Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is DENIED.Moving party is ordered to give notice.DiscussionPlaintiff propounded Form Interrogatories, Set Two, on Defendant on October 19, 2023. (Berkley Decl., ¶ 4; Exh. 1.) On December 22, 2023, Defendant Park served unverified responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set Two. (Id., Exh. 2.) To date, verifications have not been served. (Id., ¶ 12.)In opposition, Defendant argues it served verified responses on March 2, 2024. Counsel for Defendant made frequent, ongoing, and continuous efforts to obtain timely verifications from Defendant; however, Defendant did not provide meaningful response to the communication made by his counsel to obtain his cooperation and assistance in this action. (Caros Decl., ¶¶ 8-12, 17.) Defendant also argues that it did not waive its objections because it served objections within the time to respond.The Court finds the motion is moot as responses have been provided.Plaintiff also requests sanctions. Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290(c) requires sanctions when the motion is unsuccessfully opposed. Here, as the motion was not unsuccessfully opposed, the request for sanctions is denied.Plaintiff’s request for sanctions under CCP section 2023.010 for the misuse of discovery is also denied, as "sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 do not independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.” (City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504.)
