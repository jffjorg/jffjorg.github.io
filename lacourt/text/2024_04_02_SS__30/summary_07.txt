The court finds that defendant will not be prejudiced by the amendment and that plaintiff has complied with the requirements for amending a pleading. The court notes that defendant's opposition to the motion is based on a typographical error in the proposed pleading and that defendant's challenges to the sufficiency of the allegations should be raised in a demurrer. The court exercises its discretion liberally in favor of amendments and grants the motion for leave to file an amended complaint.
