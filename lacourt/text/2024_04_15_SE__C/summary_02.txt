And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a response to the defendants' motion to set aside the default in a breach of contract action. The defendants have not argued that there is irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte. Additionally, the defendants have not submitted evidence that they served the other appearing parties with the ex parte application or written opposition. Despite this, the Court has decided to set the hearing for the motion to set aside default for June 12, 2024, at 9:30 A.M. in Dept. SE-C, in the interests of judicial efficiency. The Judge advises counsel to file noticed motions after making a reservation on the Court's reservation system and only apply ex parte if necessary.
