of Lakewood. vs. Mary Congdon, et al., Case No. 22NWCP00034
 
This
is a receivership action. Receiver Richardson Griswold applies ex parte to
approve the sale of the subject real property a.k.a. 6132 Wolfe Street,
Lakewood, California 90713 and for authorization to make certain payments from
the sale proceeds. 
 
A
party seeking an ex parte order must notify all parties no later than 10 a.m.
the court day before the ex parte appearance, absent a showing of exceptional
circumstances that justify a shorter time for notice. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1203(a).) 
 
Receiver
states that he provided notice to respondents Edward Jennings, Mary Congdon,
and Barbara J. Beasley “via fedex” overnight delivery on Thursday, April 11,
2024. (Decl. Griswold, ¶ 2, Ex. A.) But it is unknown if the respondents
received notice by Friday, April 12, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. 
 
Based
on this, the ex parte application is DENIED without prejudice.  
 
Moving
party to give notice.
