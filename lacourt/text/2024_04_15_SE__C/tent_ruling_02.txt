 Case Number:  23NWCV02796    Hearing Date:   April 15, 2024    Dept:  C Ponce
v. Franco, et al., Case No. 23NWCV02796
 
This
is a breach of contract action. Defendants Heri Steven Franco, Heri G. Franco,
and Edith G. Morales move ex parte to set aside default according to Code of
Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).
 
A
party may seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing
"irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for
granting relief ex parte." (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c).)
 
Defendants
have not argued irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory
basis for granting relief ex parte. 
 
In
addition, parties appearing at the ex parte hearing must serve the ex parte
application or any written opposition on all other appearing parties at the
first reasonable opportunity. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1206.) Absent
exceptional circumstances, no hearing may be conducted unless such service has
been made. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1206.)
 
Defendants
have not submitted evidence that they served the other appearing parties. 
 
In
the interests of judicial efficiency, however, the Court specially sets the
hearing for the Motion to Set Aside Default to Wednesday, June 12, 2024, at
9:30 A.M. in Dept. SE-C. 
 
Counsel
is advised that the Court typically requires litigants to file noticed motions
after making a reservation on the Court’s reservation system.  A party may
then apply ex parte if necessary.  
 
Moving
party to give notice.
