And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on the motion to continue trial. The respondent, City of Los Angeles, moves to continue the trial date from January 13, 2025, to on or after March 28, 2025, and to set a briefing schedule. The respondent argues that the administrative record is extremely voluminous and needs additional time to review and respond to any opening brief by the petitioner. The petitioner, Crane Boulevard Safety Coalition, opposes the motion, asserting that discovery is not yet complete due to the respondent's evasiveness.

The judge grants the motion to continue trial, allowing one additional continuance. The judge finds a 30-day briefing schedule appropriate and will set the trial date and address the discovery cut-off and page limits at the hearing. The parties are ordered to meet and confer on a mutually agreeable trial date, discovery cut-off, and briefing schedule.
