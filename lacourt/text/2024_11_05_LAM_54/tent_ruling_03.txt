Department 54, Judge Maurice A. Leiter
Pitchess Motion
Moving Party: Plaintiff Sara Marin
Responding Party: Defendant City of Los Angeles
 
T/R:     PLAINTIFF’S PITCHESS MOTION IS GRANTED.
 
PLAINTIFF TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
The Court considers the moving papers,
opposition, and reply.
 
“A party seeking discovery of a peace
officer's personnel records must follow a two-step process.  First, the party must file a written motion
describing the type of records sought, supported by ‘[a]ffidavits showing good
cause for the discovery. . ., setting forth the materiality thereof to the
subject matter involved in the pending litigation and stating upon reasonable
belief that the governmental agency identified has the records or information
from the records.’  [Cal. Evid. Code §
1043(b)(3).]  This initial burden is a
‘relatively relaxed standard [ ].’ 
Information is material if it ‘“will facilitate the ascertainment of the
facts and a fair trial.”’  ‘[A]
declaration by counsel on information and belief is sufficient to state facts
to satisfy the “materiality” component of that section.’”  (Haggerty v. Superior Court (2004) 117
Cal. App. 4th 1079, 1085–1086 [citations omitted].)
 

“Second, if ‘the trial court concludes
the defendant has fulfilled these prerequisites and made a showing of good
cause, the custodian of records should bring to court all documents
“potentially relevant” to the defendant's motion. . . .  The trial court “shall examine the
information in chambers” [Cal. Evid. Code § 1045(b).], “out of the presence and
hearing of all persons except the person authorized [to possess the records]
and such other persons [the custodian of records] is willing to have present.”.
. . Subject to statutory exceptions and limitations. . . the trial court should
then disclose to the defendant “such information [that] is relevant to the
subject matter involved in the pending litigation.”’”  (Haggerty, supra at 1086.)
 
Plaintiff, a helicopter pilot and LAPD
officer, alleges Defendant discriminated against her based on her sex by, among
other things, denying her instructor pilot assignments. Plaintiff seeks the
personnel records of Officer Victor Pappas, who received a pilot position over
Plaintiff. Specifically, Plaintiff seeks documents and communications relating
to a certain “TEAMS Report” and documents relating to any action(s) taken or finding(s) made related to Victor Pappas
removing, tampering with, disconnecting, or otherwise disabling any camera or
other equipment in any helicopter, including but not limited to any inquiry,
investigation, Notice to Correct, Standards Based Assessment (SBA),
communications, or any other document related to this matter. 
 
In opposition, Defendant takes issue
with Plaintiff’s request for “communications” related to the TEAMS Report
because “communications” would not be found in the Officer’s personnel records
and instead would require a special search. Defendant also asserts that the
request for documents relating to Pappas “removing,
tampering with, disconnecting, or otherwise disabling any camera or other
equipment in any helicopter” is overbroad and vague. 
 
The Court finds good cause for
production of Pappas’ personnel records. The Court also finds that Plaintiff is
entitled to “communications” relating to the TEAMS Report as this is
information that relates directly to and arises from Pappas’ personnel records.

 
Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED.
