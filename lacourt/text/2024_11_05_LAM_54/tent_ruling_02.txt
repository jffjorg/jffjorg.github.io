BACKGROUND
 
This action arises under the California
Environment Quality Act (“CEQA”). On August 7, 2023, Petitioner Crane Boulevard
Safety Coalition filed the First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate against
Respondent City of Los Angeles and Real Parties in Interest Rachel Foullon and
Ian Cooper. On July 15, 2024, the Court granted Respondent’s motion for
judgment of the pleadings on the third and fourth causes of action. On August
2, 2024, Petitioner filed a second amended petition.
 
Petitioner challenges certain patterns
and practices of Respondent relating to the Mount Washington/Glassell Park
Specific Plan and proposed development housing project located at 464-466 Crane
Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA.
 
ANALYSIS
 
While trial continuances are generally
disfavored, pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1332(c), circumstances that indicate good
cause for a continuance include “[a] party's excused inability to obtain
essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent
efforts.” (CRC Rule 3.1332(c)(6).) Factors the Court may consider include,
“[t]he proximity of the trial date,” “[w]hether there was any previous
continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party,” and
“[t]he length of the continuance requested.” (CRC Rule 3.1332(d).)
 
Respondent
moves to continue the trial date from January 13, 2025, to on or after March
28, 2025 (74 days); (2) set a briefing schedule with Petitioner’s Opening Brief
due by January 13, 2025 (30 days after the December 13, 2024,
Discovery-Cut-Off); Opposition Briefs due February 17, 2025; and Replies due
March 4, 2025; and (3) provide for topics and page limits for briefs. 
Respondent
asserts that a continuance is necessary because the administrative record is
extremely voluminous, and Respondent will need at least 30 days to reply to any
opening brief by Petitioner. Respondent argues that the discovery cut-off date
should not be continued because Petitioner has had sufficient to time to
complete discovery since the last continuance. In opposition, Petitioner
asserts that discovery is not yet complete due to Respondent’s evasiveness.
Petitioner also seeks a continuance of trial and discovery cut-off.
It
is clear from the papers that the parties will not be prepared for the current
trial date in January 2025. The Court will allow one additional continuance of
the trial date. The Court also finds a 30-day briefing schedule appropriate. The
Court will set the trial date and address the discovery cut-off and page limits
at the hearing.
