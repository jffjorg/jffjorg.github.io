And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, Maurice Leiter, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Sangtae Choi (Plaintiff) v. Michael J. Sim (Defendant). The case involves a complaint filed by Choi alleging that Sim sent threatening texts to expose him publicly if he failed to deliver electric vehicles and $500,000.00. Sim has filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that it is unclear and fails to allege damages.

The Judge has sustained Sim's demurrer, meaning that the complaint is defective and must be rewritten. The Judge has ordered Choi to file and serve a first amended complaint within 30 days of the ruling, and Sim to file and serve a response within 30 days thereafter. The Judge has also noted that the motion to strike is moot, as the demurrer has been sustained.

The Judge's analysis is guided by California law, specifically CCP ยง 430.50(a) and Picton v. Anderson Union High Sch. Dist. (1996). The Judge has considered the moving papers and has not received opposition from the parties.
