BACKGROUND
 
On July 15, 2024, Plaintiff Sangtae
Choi filed a form complaint against Defendant Michael J. Sim, asserting Defendant
sent texts threatening to “expose Choi publicly” if he “failed to deliver to
Sim certain electric vehicles and the sum of $500,000.00.”
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer to a complaint may be taken to the whole complaint or to any
of the causes of action in it.  (CCP §
430.50(a).)  A demurrer challenges only
the legal sufficiency of the complaint, not the truth of its factual
allegations or the plaintiff's ability to prove those allegations.  (Picton v. Anderson Union High Sch. Dist. (1996)
50 Cal. App. 4th 726, 732.)  The court
must treat as true the complaint's material factual allegations, but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.  (Id. at 732-33.)  The complaint is to be construed liberally to
determine whether a cause of action has been stated.  (Id. at 733.)
 
Defendant demurs to the complaint on
the grounds that it is uncertain and fails to allege damages. The Court agrees.
As stated, Plaintiff alleges Defendant threatened “expose Choi publicly” if he
“failed to deliver to Sim certain electric vehicles and the sum of
$500,000.00.” It is unclear what cause of action Plaintiff is asserting against
Defendant. Plaintiff also does not allege facts showing Plaintiff was damaged
by Defendant’s conduct. 
 
Defendant’s demurrer is SUSTAINED. The
motion to strike is MOOT.
