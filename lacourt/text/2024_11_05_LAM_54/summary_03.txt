And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the Pitchess Motion filed by the plaintiff, Sara Marin, a helicopter pilot and LAPD officer, alleging sex-based discrimination by the City of Los Angeles. The plaintiff seeks the personnel records of Officer Victor Pappas, who received a pilot position over her, and specific documents and communications related to a "TEAMS Report" and equipment removal/disabling. The defendant opposed the request for "communications" and for documents related to equipment removal/disabling, arguing that these would require a special search and are overbroad and vague. The judge finds good cause for production of Pappas' personnel records and orders that the custodian of records bring all potentially relevant documents to court. The judge also finds that the plaintiff is entitled to "communications" relating to the TEAMS Report, as this information is directly related to and arises from Pappas' personnel records.
