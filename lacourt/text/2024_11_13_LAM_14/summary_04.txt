And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint. The defendants, Patrick Ridge and others, argued that the language in the complaint was inflammatory, improper, and irrelevant, and that it included conclusions of law. The judge found that the language describing the defendant's conduct as "shameless", "disgusting", and "vile" was relevant to the plaintiff's cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress and to the demand for punitive damages. The judge also found that the language was not irrelevant or improper, and that the legal conclusions in the complaint were not sufficient to strike the pleading. The judge concluded that the motion to strike was denied on both grounds.
