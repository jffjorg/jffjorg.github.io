And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the County of Los Angeles (COLA) is immune from liability for the plaintiff's injuries, as alleged in the complaint. The plaintiff, Laquidarryl Ashley, claims that he was not given medical care while he was incarcerated and that this led to him suffering grave medical conditions. The judge has sustained COLA's demurrer, which means that the complaint has been dismissed, and has granted COLA's motion to strike the plaintiff's demands for attorney's fees. The judge has also granted the plaintiff 15 days to amend the complaint to address the deficiencies identified in the ruling.
