And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Nibbelink's motion for leave to file a First Amended Cross-Complaint. Nibbelink seeks to add a new cause of action for enforcement of a mechanic's lien release bond and related allegations. The court finds that the new allegations could not have been added earlier because the mechanic's lien release bond was not recorded until October 1, 2024. Since the motion is unopposed, the court is satisfied that the motion is meritorious. Nibbelink is ordered to file its First Amended Cross-Complaint within 10 days of this order.
