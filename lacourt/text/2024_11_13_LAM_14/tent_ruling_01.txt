Legal Standard
A court
may, in its discretion and after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any
terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other
particulars; and may upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time
limited by this code. (Code Civ. Proc., section 473, subd. (a)(1); Branick
v. Downey Savings & Loan Association (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.)
A motion to amend a pleading
before trial must (1) include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended
pleading, which must be serially numbered to differentiate it from previous
pleadings or amendments; (2) state what allegations in the previous pleading
are proposed to be deleted, if any, and where, by page, paragraph and line
number, the deleted allegations are located; and (3) state what allegations are
proposed to be added to the previous pleading, if any, and where, by page,
paragraph, and line number, the additional allegations are located. (Cal. Rules
of Court, Rule 3.1324(a).) A separate supporting declaration specifying (1) the
effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3)
when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4)
the reason why the request for amendment was not made earlier must accompany
the motion. (Id., Rule 3.1324(b).) 
Discussion
Nibbelink moves to amend the Cross-Complaint by adding a
fifth cause of action for enforcement of a mechanic’s lien release bond and
allegations related to this new cause of action. (Holbrook Decl., ¶3.) This
cause of action and related allegations were not included earlier because Defendant
ACI did not record the subject mechanic’s lien release bond until October 1,
2024. (Id., ¶2.) Nibbelink properly includes a declaration from counsel,
a copy of the proposed amended pleading, and an explanation of what allegations
were added to the amended pleading. (Id., Exh. 1.) 
Nibbelink meets the requirements of Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1324. The Court is satisfied that the new allegations could not
have been added earlier because ACI did not record the subject mechanic’s lien
release bond until October 1, 2024. Additionally, this motion is unopposed. The
lack of an opposition amounts to a concession that the motion is meritorious.
(See California Rules of Court Rule 3.1113(a); see also Rule 3.1320(f); Herzberg
v. County of Plumas (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1, 20 (the party who
fails to argue an issue abandons that issue).) Therefore, Nibbelink’s motion to
file a First Amended Cross-Complaint is GRANTED.
Conclusion
Nibbelink’s motion for leave to file a First Amended
Cross-Complaint is GRANTED. Nibbelink is to file its First Amended
Cross-Complaint within 10 days of this order.
