The court grants the motion and orders the defendants to serve further code-compliant responses within 20 days. The court also imposes sanctions against the defendants and their counsel in the amount of $761.65. The court finds that the defendants' objections to the interrogatories were without merit and that the defendants failed to demonstrate substantial justification for their conduct. The court also finds that the defendants' surveillance investigation was not protected by the attorney work-product privilege and that the surveillance footage is discoverable. The court grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses and awards sanctions against the defendants and their counsel.
