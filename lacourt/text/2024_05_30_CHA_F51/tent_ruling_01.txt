(“Defendant”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Laura V. Campos
(“Plaintiff”)
NOTICE: OK 
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: Orders compelling Plaintiff’s
responses to Defendant’s first set of Requests for Production of Documents
(“RFPs”); Form Interrogatories; and Special Interrogatories. Defendant further
requests monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and/or her counsel in the total
amount of $1,384.95.

is ordered to provide objection-free responses to Defendant’s first set of
discovery requests within 20 days. The Court imposes sanctions against Plaintiff
and her counsel in the amount of $661.65.
 
Defendant is reminded to review the 5/3/19 First Amended
General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil. When e-filing
documents, parties must comply with the “TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS” which are set
forth at page 4, line 4 through page 5, line 12 of the Court’s 5/3/19 First
Amended General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil (particularly bookmarking
declarations and exhibits). (CRC 3.1110(f)(4).) Failure to comply with these
requirements in the future may result in papers being rejected, matters being
placed off calendar, matters being continued so documents can be resubmitted in
compliance with these requirements, documents not being considered and/or the
imposition of sanctions.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a personal injury action in
which Plaintiff alleges that on 6/4/21, she was injured in an automobile
collision between the vehicle she was driving and the vehicle which Defendant
was driving. (Compl. ¶¶
7–8.) On 6/5/23, Plaintiff filed her complaint, alleging against Defendant the
sole cause of action for Negligence. On 10/11/23, Defendant filed her answer.
 
On 10/11/23, Defendant served the subject discovery requests
on Plaintiff. (Decl. of Gabriella Baharvar ¶ 3.) On 1/26/24, Defendant filed
the instant motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses thereto. No oppositions have
been filed to date.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A propounding party may move for an
order compelling a response to a request for production of documents if the
responding party fails to serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ.
Proc. §§ 2031.300, subd. (b); 2031.260, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding
party who fails to serve a timely response “waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product” unless
the Court grants it relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd.
(a).)
 
A propounding party may move for an
order compelling a response to interrogatories if the responding party fails to
serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290, subd.
(b); 2030.260, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding party who fails to serve
a timely response “waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings
under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product” unless
the Court grants it relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subd.
(a).)
 
Here, as Defendant served the
subject discovery requests on Plaintiff by electronic service on 10/11/23, the last
day for Plaintiff to respond was 11/14/23. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).)
“To this date, there has been no response to Defendant’s discovery request[s]
received in this office and no requests for extension of time have been made.” (Baharvar
Decl. ¶ 5.) The Court notes that Plaintiff
has failed to oppose the instant motions. Accordingly, the Court grants the
instant unopposed motions to compel Plaintiff to provide responses to the
subject discovery requests.
 
Sanctions¿ 
 
“The court shall impose a monetary
sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
“The court shall impose a monetary
sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
 
Additionally, “the court may impose
a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that
conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
 
Here, Moving Defendant requests a
combined $1,384.95 in monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel.
This amount includes 2 hours of Defendant’s attorney’s time spent preparing each
motion, at counsel’s hourly rate of $200.00 per hour. (Baharvar Decl. ¶ 7.) Defendant also
seeks to recover $61.65 in filing fees per each motion. (Ibid.)
 
In granting the instant unopposed motion,
the Court finds it reasonable to award Defendant sanctions against Plaintiff
and her counsel in the total amount of $661.65. 
¿ 
CONCLUSION¿ 
 
The unopposed motions are granted.
Plaintiff is ordered to provide objection-free responses to Defendant’s first
set of discovery requests within 20 days. The Court imposes sanctions against Plaintiff
and her counsel in the amount of $661.65.
