```

And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a first supplemental and third amended complaint, which adds an incident of discrimination and retaliation that occurred after the second amended complaint was filed. The court finds that the policy favoring amendments to pleadings is strong and that the proposed amendment is necessary and proper. The court notes that the defendant's argument that the plaintiff's proposed amendment is frivolous and would be futile is unavailing. The court also finds that the defendant's argument that it will be prejudiced by the proposed amendment is not sufficient to overcome the policy of liberality in permitting amendments to the complaint.
