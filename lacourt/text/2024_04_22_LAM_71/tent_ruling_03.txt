DEBORAH MAYERS, et al.,  
  
         vs.
 
ROBERT WEBB, et al.


 Case No.: 
  22STCV33528
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  April 22, 2024



 
Defendant Robert Webb’s unopposed
demurrer to Plaintiffs Deborah Mayers’, Marcia Brown’s, and
Rochelle Minor’s first amended complaint is overruled. 
 
Defendant Robert Webb (“Webb”) (“Defendant”) demurs unopposed
to Plaintiffs Deborah
Mayers’ (“Mayers”), Marcia Brown’s (“Brown”), and Rochelle Minor’s (“Minor”)
(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) first amended complaint (“FAC”) as to the single
cause of action for quiet title.  (Notice of Demurrer, pgs.
1-2.)
 
Background
Plaintiffs filed the initial complaint (“Complaint”) on October
14, 2022, against Defendant and Non-moving Defendants J.P. Morgan Chase N.A.
dba J.P. Morgan Chase National Corporate Services, Inc. (“J.P. Morgan Chase”)
and all persons unknown claiming and legal or equitable title, estate, lien, or
interest in the property described in the Complaint adverse to Plaintiffs’
title or any cloud upon Plaintiffs’ title (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging
a single cause of action for quiet title.
On January 31, 2024, this Court sustained Webb’s demurrer to the
Complaint with 20 days leave to amend. 
(1/31/24 Minute Order.)  On February
20, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the operative FAC.
On March 27, 2024, Webb filed the instant demurrer.  As of the date of this hearing no opposition
has been filed.
 
Summary of Demurrer
Webb demurs to Plaintiff’s 1st cause of action on the basis that the
cause of action fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action, that Plaintiffs have filed their claim in the wrong court because the
Probate Court has exclusive jurisdiction over matters relating to the internal
affairs of a trust, and pursuant to Probate Code §§16061.7 and 16061.8,
Plaintiffs are permanently barred from pursuing any claims concerning the terms
of the trust as amended.  (Demurrer, pg.
3; C.C.P. §430.10(e).)
 
          Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring
party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer. 
(C.C.P. §430.41(a), emphasis added.) 
A declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the results of the
meet and confer process.  (C.C.P.
§430.41(a)(3).)
Webb’s counsel declares on March 20, 2024, he called Plaintiff’s
counsel to attempt to meet and confer and was unable to reach counsel and left
a voicemail.  (Decl. of Buck ¶3.)  Webb’s counsel’s declaration states that on March
21, 2024, his office sent correspondence to Plaintiffs’ counsel requesting a
date to meet and confer regarding the deficiencies raised in the instant
demurrer.  (Decl. of Buck ¶4.)  Webb’s counsel declares that
to date he has not received any response to his attempts to meet and confer.  (Decl. of Buck ¶4.)[1]  Webb’s counsel’s declaration is sufficient
under C.C.P. §430.41.  Accordingly, the
Court will consider the instant demurrer.

 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc.
(2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable.  (See Donabedian v.
Mercury Insurance Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a
demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to
judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their
contents].)  For purposes of ruling on a
demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true, but the
reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital District
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Failure to State a Claim
Quiet Title (1st COA)
A cause of action for quiet title must allege the following
elements: (1) a description of the property; (2) plaintiff’s title or interest
and the basis; (3) defendant’s asserting adverse claim or antagonistic property
interest; (4) the date as of which the determination is sought; and (5) a prayer
for determination of title.
  (CCP §761.020; see
Lucas v. Sweet (1956) 47 Cal.2d 20, 22 [sufficient to plead that plaintiff
is the owner of described property, defendant wrongfully claims interest,
unless complaint reveals a defect in title]; 
Leeper v. Beltrami (1959) 53 Cal. 2d 195, 214 [“general rule that
a cause of action to quiet title may be stated in general terms”]; Dreher v.
Rohrmoser  (1955) 134 Cal.App.2d 196,
198 [complainants can specifically plead the invalidity of defendants’ legal
title and courts may enter such judgment as the equities require]; Lewis v.
Superior Court (1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1850, 1866 [complaint to quiet title
must be verified]; Chao Fu, Inc. v. Wen Ching Chen (2012) 206
Cal.App.4th 48, 57 [“absent an interest in the property, a party has no
standing to ask the court to quiet title in the property or to obtain damages
for the cloud on title.”].)
          Plaintiffs allege
this case involves the residential property located at 6577 2nd Avenue, Los
Angeles, CA 90043 (“Property”).  (FAC
¶10.)  Plaintiffs allege the Property is
legally described as follows: “ALL REAL PROPERTY SITUATED IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES,
COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES, STATE OF CALIFORNIA, DESCRIBED AS : LOT 22, BLOCK 9 OF
TRACT NO 6543, AS PER MAP RECORDED IN BOOK 71, PAGES 35 TO 36 INCLUSIVE, IN THE
OFFICE OF THE COUNTY RECORDER OF SAID
COUNTY.”  (FAC ¶11.)
Plaintiffs allege on or about September 26, 2005, Mary Smith
(“Decedent”) the owner of the Property, executed an inter vivos trust entitled
The Mary Marcella Smith Living Trust Dated September 26, 2005 (“Trust”).  (FAC ¶12, Exh. 1.) Plaintiffs allege
subsequently, the Decedent executed a restatement (amendment) of the Trust,
which is dated November 10, 2010 (“November 10, 2010, Trust Amendment”).  (FAC ¶13, Exh. 2.)  Plaintiffs allege thereafter, on or about June
5, 2013, the Decedent executed another restatement (amendment) of the Trust
(“June 5, 2013, Trust Amendment”).  (FAC
¶14, Exh. 3.)  Plaintiffs allege
subsequently, on or about December 15, 2017, the decedent executed a Revocation
of the Mary Marcella Smith Living Trust (“Revocation”).  (FAC ¶15, Exh. 4.)
          Plaintiffs allege
ultimately, Decedent died on or about October 4, 2018. (FAC ¶16.)  Plaintiffs allege the Defendant, on or about
July 16, 2019, filed an Application to Probate Will and for Issuance of Letters
Testamentary in Jefferson County, Texas.  (FAC ¶17.)  Plaintiffs allege on or about August 12, 2019,
they filed an Opposition to Defendant’s Application to Probate Will and for
Issuance of Letters Testamentary in Jefferson County, Texas.  (FAC ¶18.)  Plaintiffs allege to resolve the matter filed
in Jefferson County, Texas, Plaintiffs Mayers and Brown signed a Family
Settlement Agreement (“Settlement Agreement”) with Defendant on or about July
of 2020.  (FAC ¶19.)  Plaintiffs allege the Settlement Agreement
involves the Property that is the subject of this suit, which purports to leave
the
Property with Defendant.  (FAC
¶19.)
          Plaintiffs allege
subsequently, on or about October 13, 2020, Defendant executed a grant deed
(“Trust Deed”) transferring the Property from Decedent’s Trust to Defendant.  (FAC ¶20.)  Plaintiffs allege this Trust Deed was
ultimately recorded at the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office on or about May
18, 2021. (FAC ¶20, Exh. 5.)  Plaintiffs
allege on information and belief that due to the fact that Decedent executed a Revocation
of the Trust, the Property here in Los Angeles County, California must be
probated to legally and validly to transfer ownership from the Decedent to her
lawful heirs, which are the Plaintiffs.  (FAC ¶21.)  Plaintiffs allege on information and belief
that due to Plaintiffs’ belief that they are intestate heirs, which was
adjudicated as such in the probate court of Jefferson County, dated November
10, 2020, Webb acquired legal titled fraudulently by recording a trust transfer
deed in the Los Angeles Recorder’s office when the trust had already been
revoked.  (FAC ¶22, Exh. 6.)  Plaintiffs allege at the time of Decedent’s
death, they held equitable title to the Property as the intestate heirs of the
Decedent.  (FAC ¶22.)  Plaintiffs allege on information and belief
that Webb is not the true owner of the Property, but instead Plaintiffs are
since the Property has not legally transferred to Plaintiffs.  (FAC ¶23.)
          Plaintiffs allege
on or about February 24, 2022, Defendant along with non-moving Defendant Chase
Bank (“Chase”) executed and recorded a Deed of Trust for which the Property is
security for a loan in the amount of one hundred and sixty-two thousand eight
hundred dollars ($162,800.00).  (FAC
¶24.)  Plaintiffs allege on information
and belief that the value of the Property is estimated to be eight hundred and
fifty thousand dollars ($850,000.00), which is in excess of the encumbrances of
record and costs of sale in relation to the Property.  (FAC ¶25.)
          Plaintiffs allege
by virtue of the foregoing facts, Plaintiffs are entitled to a judicial
declaration that Plaintiffs are the true 100.00% owners of the subject
Property, as Plaintiffs are the legal heirs of the Decedent who acquired
equitable title to the Property at Decedent’s death.  (FAC ¶27.) 
Plaintiffs allege Webb currently holds legal title to the Property as he
fraudulently recorded a Trust Transfer Deed when he knew the trust was revoked.  (FAC ¶27.) 
Plaintiffs allege they seek to quiet title to the Property in Plaintiffs
name alone as of the date of May 18, 2021. 
(FAC ¶28.)
          “The owner of the
legal title to property is presumed to be the owner of the full beneficial title.
This presumption may be rebutted only by clear and convincing proof.”  (Evid. Code §662.)  There is no exception to this evidentiary
rule, even where the plaintiff claims that the Defendant breached a fiduciary
duty.  (Toney v. Nolde (1985) 173
Cal.App.3d 791, 796.)  “[A]s a general
matter an action to quiet title cannot be maintained by the owner of equitable
title as
against the holder of legal title.”  (Warren v. Merrill (2006) 143
Cal.App.4th 96, 113.)  When legal title
has been acquired through fraud any number of remedies are available and appropriate.
 (Id. at pg. 114.)  These remedies include quieting title in the
defrauded equitable title holder’s name and making the legal title holder the
constructive trustee of the property for the benefit of the defrauded equitable
titleholder.  (Id.)
          As a preliminary
matter, an action by a beneficiary against the trustee for, e.g., breach of trust,
conversion, or fraud concerns the internal affairs of the trust and therefore
must be heard by the court having jurisdiction over the trust under
Probate Code §17000(a).  (Prob.
Code §17000(a).)  The “probate court,” or
probate department of the superior court hearing proceedings concerning the
internal affairs of trusts, has “all the powers of the superior court.”  (Prob. Code §17001.) Plaintiffs’ FAC does not
allege the existence of a valid trust, but rather that the Trust at issue was
revoked.  (FAC ¶15, Exh. 4.)  Further, neither party requested judicial
notice of other filings in LASC’s Probate Division that would indicate this
Court is without jurisdiction to decide matters in the instant case.
          Plaintiffs allege on
information and belief that they are Decedent’s intestate heirs and that Webb
acquired legal title fraudulently by recording a trust transfer deed in the Los
Angeles County Recorder’s office when the trust had already been revoked.  (FAC ¶¶20, 22, Exhs. 5, 6.)  Plaintiffs sufficiently allege a cause of
action for quiet title on the basis Webb acquired legal title through fraud and
therefore only has “bare legal title” and is considered a “constructive
trustee” of the Property.  (See Warren,
143 Cal.App.4th at pgs. 113-114.) 
Plaintiffs sufficiently allege the basis of title, the adversity of
their claims, and the date of which determination is sought.  (FAC ¶¶21-23, 28.)
          Accordingly, Webb’s
demurrer is overruled.
 
Conclusion
Webb’s demurrer to Plaintiffs’ FAC is overruled.
