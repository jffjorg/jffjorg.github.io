And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is that the demurrer filed by Defendant Robert Webb to the first amended complaint (FAC) will be overruled. The court finds that the FAC sufficiently alleges a cause of action for quiet title, alleging that the Defendant acquired legal title fraudulently by recording a trust transfer deed in the Los Angeles County Recorder's office when the trust had already been revoked. The court also finds that the Defendant's demurrer is based on the incorrect notion that the probate court has jurisdiction over the internal affairs of the trust. The court rules that it has jurisdiction to decide the matter and that the Defendant's demurrer is without merit. The court orders that the Defendant's demurrer be overruled and that the matter proceed to the next stage of the litigation.
