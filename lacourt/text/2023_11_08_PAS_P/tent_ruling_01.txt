[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT MILLER’S MOTIONS TO COMPEL PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSES TO
  SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES AND REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, AND REQUEST
  FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS
 
 
Date:   November
  8, 2023
Time:  8:30 a.m.
Dept.:  P



 
I.        INTRODUCTION
          In this personal injury action, Plaintiff Jonathan Lenox (Lenox)
alleges that while he was performing his duties as a security guard for Motion
Picture Health and Pension Plans, Defendant Troy Thomas Miller (Miller) ignored
his hand signal to stop and instead drove his vehicle directly into Lenox and
then sped away, leaving him with severe injuries.
          Before the Court are the two discovery motions by Miller
filed October 11, 2023, seeking orders compelling Lenox to provide responses to
Special Interrogatories, Set Three, and Request for Production of Documents,
Set Three. The motions are unopposed, and are granted. 
 
          II.      LEGAL
STANDARD 
          Code Civ. Proc. Section 2030.290 provides that when a party
to whom interrogatories have been propounded fails to serve a timely response,
that party waives any objection to the interrogatories.  It further provides that the propounding
party may move for an order compelling responses. Subdivision (c) provides for
monetary sanctions in connection with such motion. (CCP § 2030.290.)
          Code Civ. Proc. Section 2031.300 provides that when a party
to whom an inspection demand has been propounded fails to serve a timely
response, that party waives any objection to the inspection demand; it further
provides that the propounding party may move for an order compelling a response
to the demand. Subdivision (c) provides for monetary sanctions in connection
with such motion. (CCP § 2031.300.)
 
          III.     DISCUSSION
          A. Motions
          On May 22, 2023, Miller served Lenox with a Request for
Production of Documents, Set 3 and Special Interrogatories, Set Three via
electronic service. Responses were due June 23, 2023. When no responses were
received, defense counsel emailed courtesy copies of the discovery requests to
Plaintiff’s counsel on July 14, 2023. (Camacho Decl. ¶ 4, referencing Exh. B.) Defense
counsel then reached out again by email to Plaintiff’s counsel on September 20,
2023. (Camacho Decl. ¶ 5, referencing Exh. C.) Plaintiff’s counsel did not
respond. (Camacho Decl. ¶ 6.) As of the date this motion was filed, Lenox has
not provided responses.
          Based on this record, Miller is entitled to the relief
requested. 
          B. Sanctions
          Miller requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $630.00
for each of the two motions. Miller’s counsel, James Fischer, declares that he
spent 2 hours preparing each motion, anticipates 1 hour to be spent at the
hearing on each motion and paid $60.00 for the filing fee for each motion.
(Fischer Decl. ¶ 2.) His hourly rate is $190. (Id.) Multiplying $630 by
two yields $1260.00, the total amount of sanctions requested, for both the
motions. 
          The Court finds that 5 hours (2 hours per motion for motion
preparation and 1 hour total for appearance at the hearing) at the hourly rate
of $190 is reasonable. 5 hours x $190/hour = $950.00. Adding two $60 filing
fees brings the total to $1,070.00.  
 
          IV.     ORDER
          Lenox is ordered to provide code compliant, verified
responses without objection to Special Interrogatories, Set Three, and Requests
for Production of Documents, Set Three, within 10 days of notice of this order.
Lenox is further ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,070.00 to
the moving party within 30 days of notice of this order.      Miller is ordered to provide notice of
this ruling.
