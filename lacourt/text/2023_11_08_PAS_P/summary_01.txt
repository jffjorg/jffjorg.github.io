And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motions filed by Defendant Troy Thomas Miller, seeking to compel Plaintiff Jonathan Lenox to provide responses to special interrogatories and requests for production of documents. The motions were unopposed and were granted due to Lenox's failure to respond to the discovery requests. The judge has also awarded Miller monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,070.00, which is based on the reasonable hourly rate of $190 for 5 hours of work preparing the motions and appearing at the hearing. The judge has ordered Lenox to provide code-compliant, verified responses without objection to the discovery requests within 10 days of notice of this order and to pay the monetary sanctions within 30 days of notice.
