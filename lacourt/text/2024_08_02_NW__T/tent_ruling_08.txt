 Case Number:  LC107621    Hearing Date:   August 2, 2024    Dept:  T GPL V LAKE
LINDERO LC107621
 
Motion to
compel further response to FROGS by plaintiff against defendant Lordon.
 
Tentative
ruling:
 
Frog 4.1       Grant
Frog 15.1     Grant
Frog 50.1     Grant
 
Further verified
responses without objection due within 20 days.
 
No
sanctions.  
 
The court
ordered on 5/22/2024 that a Joint Separate Statement be filed because the court
found that plaintiff’s separate statement did not contain all of the
information necessary for the Court to rule on the discovery disputes and
deprived defendant of the opportunity to submit their argument against an order
for further responses. The Joint Separate Statement was to be filed no later
than 5 court days prior to the hearing, which would have been July 26th.  Lordon’s counsel asserts that the document
was not sent to it for inserting its position until July 25th and
objects because it was not given sufficient time to add its argument.  The court also finds that there was no meet
and confer in good faith by plaintiff, requiring the court to order a meet and
confer, and that despite having been given an extension to provide further
responses, plaintiff filed the motion for that extension had expired.
 
Accordingly,
the court finds substantial justification for no award of monetary sanctions.
