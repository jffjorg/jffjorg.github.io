And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a response to a motion by the plaintiff, FROGS, to compel further response to them from the defendant, Lordon. The Judge has granted the motion and orders the defendant to provide further verified responses without objection within 20 days. The Judge notes that the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient information in their separate statement, which resulted in the defendant being deprived of the opportunity to submit their argument. The Judge also finds that there was no meet and confer in good faith by the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff filed the motion for extension after it had expired. As a result, the Judge has decided not to award monetary sanctions to the defendant.
