And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a summary of the court's thinking based on the information presented before the hearing. The Judge is considering four main issues: (1) the application of judgment lien by the Cooper parties for orders directing payment towards partial satisfaction of judgment, assignment of forfeited interests, and maintenance of partial interests; (2) an ex parte application by Receiver Christopher Conway to pool trust assets and aggregate investor interests in a new receivership trust; (3) an ex parte application by Judge Debtor Grady for an order shortening time for notice of motion regarding issues to be heard on August 1, 2024; and (4) a petition to confirm resignation of Bank of Utah as successor trustee to the Reliant Trust.

The Judge has ordered the Receiver to comply with previous court orders, including circulating status reports to parties and the court, and to pay $1,000,000 towards satisfaction of judgment. The Judge has also ordered the Receiver to release personal emails and health-related information to Grady and to maintain partial interests assigned to the Cooper parties. The Judge has denied without prejudice the Receiver's motion to pool trust assets and aggregate investor interests. The Judge has also denied the petition to confirm resignation of Bank of Utah as successor trustee, citing the Receiver's failure to respond to the petition and engage a successor trustee. The Judge has expressed concern about the Receiver's failure to comply with court orders and has threatened to replace the Receiver if it fails to comply. The Judge will hear argument on August 2, 2024.
