And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for leave to file a cross-complaint by Herald Christian Health Center (HCHC) against non-party Azusa Pacific University (APU). The cross-complaint alleges indemnification and other claims based on a contract between HCHC and APU. The Judge grants the motion, finding that the cause of action arises from the same series of transactions/occurrences and that judicial economy is sufficient grounds to allow the filing of the cross-complaint. The Judge also denies the request for bifurcation by the plaintiff, Anne McLellan, as it failed to provide proper notice and opportunity to be heard on the issue.
