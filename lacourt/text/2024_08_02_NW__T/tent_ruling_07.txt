Tentative ruling:
PETITION TO CONFIRM RESIGNATION OF BANK OF UTAH AS SUCCESSOR TRUSTEE TO THE
RELIANT TRUST
Continue.  The court questions Receiver why no papers
were filed by it to approve or disapprove the petition.  The Receiver has not identified a successor
trustee despite being ordered to do so at least 8-10 months  ago. 
The Receiver has not filed a report as to the status of its reengagement
of Bank of Utah or the search for a successor. 
The court considers the failure of the Receiver to respond to the
petition and the failure to engage a successor trustee as potential neglect of
its duties as Receiver.  The court will
consider issuing an OSC why the Receiver should not be replaced.
The court will hear argument on
8/2/2024.
