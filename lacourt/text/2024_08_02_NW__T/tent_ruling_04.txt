Gabriel v GASA
Tentative
ruling: DEFENDANT BRIAN DOZIER'S NOTICE OF DEMURRER AND DEMURRER TO COMPLAINT
The
demurrer is taken off calendar as moot.  Answer
shall be filed by defendant Brian Dozier to the FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT within
20 days.
Defendant
demurred on 6/26/2024 to the Complaint. 
However, a First Amended Complaint was filed on 5/6/2024 and was served
on defendant Dozier on 5/29/2024.  The
demurrer is off calendar as moot as the original complaint was superseded by
the amended complaint.
The
time to demur to the First Amended Complaint has expired.  Therefore, defendant Dozier must answer the
First Amended Complaint, or the court will authorize the entry of default after
20 days if no answer is filed.
