And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Defendant Perry Cooper's motion to compel arbitration and stay the action. The motion was originally heard by the Court on June 20, 2024, and the Court ruled on REO's motion but continued Cooper's motion for further briefing. Cooper and Plaintiff Gina Watson both filed supplemental briefs on July 3, 2024 and July 16, 2024, respectively.

The Court finds that Cooper, as a nonsignatory to the Loan/DOT, can enforce the arbitration provision in the agreement as an alleged agent of REO. The Court reviews the agency analysis and finds that individual defendants can enforce an arbitration provision as nonsignatories if they were acting as agents of the corporate entity. The allegations against Cooper allege that he was the President and Shareholder of REO and that his alleged misconduct was undertaken in his capacity as President of REO.

Plaintiff argued that the agency allegation is conclusory and not an admitted fact, but the Court finds that the Rowe Court reviewed the allegations of the pleading to make its determination regarding agency. Plaintiff also argued that the claims against Cooper are outside the scope of the arbitration agreement, but the Court previously ruled that the scope of the arbitration agreement is broad and covers the claims at issue.

The Court finds that Cooper's motion to compel arbitration and stay the action is persuasive and grants the motion.
