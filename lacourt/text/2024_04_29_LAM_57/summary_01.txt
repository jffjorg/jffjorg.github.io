```

And here is the English text summary:

The judge is reviewing the County's motion for leave to file a summary judgment motion. The issue is whether the County is conceding that the Court did not extend the deadline for filing summary judgment motions when the trial date was continued. The judge notes a discrepancy between the Notice of Ruling from the June 1, 2023 hearing and the Minute Order from the same hearing. The Notice of Ruling states that the deadline for filing summary judgment motions was not continued, while the Minute Order mentions "all related Pre-Trial Deadlines" being continued. The judge concludes that if the County is conceding that the Notice of Ruling accurately captures the Court's decision, then the County's motion for leave to file a summary judgment motion should be denied.
