Background
 
On
January 1, 2024, Nicholas F. Sherman (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against
Ori Sultan (“Sultan”), AS Woodland Hills LLC (“AWH”) and Does 1 to 20. The
Complaint alleges three causes of action: (1) Quiet Title, (2) Fraud, and (3)
Recovery of Money Paid to Unlicensed Contractor. 
 
On
January 23, 2024, Defendant AWH filed an unlawful Detainer against Plaintiff. 
                                    
On
February 22, 2024, Defendant Sultan filed a demurrer to strike Plaintiff’s
third cause of action. Plaintiff opposes the demurrer. The matter is now before
the court. 
 
Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Where pleadings are defective, a
party may raise the defect by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950)
36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds
for a demurrer must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially
noticeable matters.¿ (CCP, § 430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d
311, 318.) In evaluating a demurrer, the court accepts the complainant’s
properly pled facts as true and ignores contentions, deductions, and conclusory
statements. (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1976) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713; Serrano
v. Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) Moreover, the court does not consider
whether a plaintiff will be able to prove the allegations or the possible
difficulty in making such proof. (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital
(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 590, 604.) 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)
 
II.        Demurrer[1]
 
            A.        Summary
of Allegations in Complaint
 
On
May 19, 2019, Plaintiff purchased a property located at 22110 Providencia St.
Woodland Hills, CA (the “Property”). (Compl. ¶¶ 1, 7.) Defendant Sultan was the
neighbor of Plaintiff and owned a residence on the adjoining property.
(Compl.  ¶ 2.) In January 2020, Sultan
began offering construction and loan services to Plaintiff and asserted that he
had special knowledge of Calabasas real estate. (Compl. ¶¶ 10, 11.) 
 
On
January 15, 2020, Sultan pointed out that Plaintiff’s electrical panner was out
of code and needed to be replaced and that Plaintiff had termites. (Compl. ¶
15.) Plaintiff and Sulton reached an agreement wherein Plaintiff would pay for
materials and labor and Sultan would not receive any profit for the work.
(Compl. ¶ 12.) No written estimate was offered by Sultan and Plaintiff had to
obtain a loan to finance the project due to his low credit, with Sultan being
the co-signer. (Compl. ¶ 14.) Plaintiff initially obtained a loan for $20,000
but by April 2020, the scope of the project increased, and Plaintiff had
accrued $200,000.00 in expenses. (Compl. ¶ 15.) In March 2020, the Construction
project was halted due to COVID-19. (Compl. ¶ 18.) 
 
Defendant
Sultan encouraged Plaintiff to take advantage of the bank forbearance program
to obtain additional capital for the construction project by increasing the
construction project to include a 20-square-foot expansion for an increased
kitchen size, modifying the guest bathroom, and adding a walk-in closet.
(Compl. ¶ 18.) Sultan represented to Plaintiff that the project would be
completed quickly. (Compl. ¶ 18.) Plaintiff believes that Defendant AS is an
entity owned and controlled by Defendant Sultan. (Compl. ¶ 3.) 
 
On
July 1, 2020, Plaintiff and his family moved back into the Property. (Compl. ¶
23.) Construction was not yet completed, and Plaintiff signed the title of a
Mercedes Benz S550 over to Sultan as collateral to complete work on the master
and guest closet shelves. (Compl. ¶ 24.) By January 2021, the construction
project was about 75% to 80% completed. (Compl. ¶ 25.) 
 
By
April 2021, Plaintiff's attempts to refinance the Property had failed. (Compl.
¶ 26.) On June 10, 2021, Plaintiff sold the property to AWH for $850,000.00,
which included back taxes and delinquent mortgage. (Compl. ¶ 28.) Plaintiff
believes AWH is owned and controlled by Defendant Sultan. (Compl. ¶ 3.)
Plaintiff asserts that he received no money from the sale of the property and,
instead, Sultan paid the forbearance sum (11 months of mortgage payments) and
$5,635 in delinquent taxes. (Compl. ¶ 28.) 
 
Plaintiff
asserts that the agreement was that Plaintiff would continue to make all
payments concerning the Property and after Plaintiff fixed his credit, he would
pay off the loan and at the end of the 5-year mortgage, title would transfer
back to Plaintiff with equity for fair market value. (Compl. ¶ 28.) 
 
On
November 23, 2021, a rat infestation was discovered which Sultan blamed on the
lack of shelves for dog food. (Compl. ¶ 30.) Plaintiff paid Sultan $5,000.00 to
remodel the garage and install dog food shelving. (Compl. ¶ 30.) By July 10,
2022, Plaintiff was falling behind on payments, resulting in Plaintiff
suffering a nervous breakdown and losing his job. (Compl. ¶¶ 31-34.) On October
10, 2023, Sultan told Plaintiff he would be evicted if he did not pay
$7,500.00. (Compl. ¶ 35.) Plaintiff paid but on November 10, 2023, Sultan told
Plaintiff he would be evicted if he did not pay $6,500.00. (Compl. ¶ 36.) 
 
On
January 11, 2024, Plaintiff brought this action against Defendants Sultan and
AWH. Defendants Sultan and AWH now demur to the third cause of action. 
 
B.        Third Cause of Action – Recovery of
Money Paid to Unlicensed Contractor
 
Bus. & Prof. Code § 7031(b) states: “Except as provided in subdivision (e), a
person who utilizes the services of an unlicensed contractor may bring an
action in any court of competent jurisdiction in this state to recover all
compensation paid to the unlicensed contractor for performance of any act or
contract.” Section 7031 allows “any person who utilizes [the services of an
unlicensed contractor] to bring an action for disgorgement of all compensation
paid for the performance of any act or contract, even when the work performed
is free of defects.” (San Francisco CDC LLC v. Webcor Construction
L.P. (2021) 62 Cal.App.5th 266, 271 (San Francisco CDC.) 
 
Defendants demur to
the third cause of action on the basis that section 7031 has a one-year statute
of limitations, and the Complaint alleges that Plaintiff sold the Property on
June 26, 2021, and that November 23, 2021, is the last date construction
services were provided related to installing shelving in the garage. (Compl. ¶¶
28, 30.) However, Plaintiff did not file this action until January 11, 2024,
more than one year after the construction services were provided and the
Complaint makes no allegations that Defendants engaged in construction services
within the one-year statute of limitations. 
 
In Eisenberg Village of Los
Angeles Jewish Home for the Aging v. Suffolk Construction Company, Inc.
(2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 1201, the appellate court held that CCP § 340(a) governed
section 7031 and that “the one-year statute of limitation, applies to
disgorgement claims brought under section 7031(b),” and
“the discovery rule does not apply to section 7031(b) claims.” (Id. at
pp. 1212-1214.) 
 
Subsequently, in San Francisco CDC LLC
v. Webcor Construction L.P. (2021) 62 Cal.App.5th 266, the appellate
court upheld the decision in Eisenberg and confirmed that “regardless of
when the owner became aware of the lapse in license,” section 7031 requires
that all claims be brought “within one year of completion of the work[.]” (62
Cal.App.5th 266, 279.) “We further agree that such claims accrue upon the
completion or cessation of the performance of the act or contract at issue and
are not subject to tolling under the delayed discovery rule.” (Id. at p.
280.) 
 
Plaintiff’s opposition relies on the
delayed discovery rule to argue that section 7031 remains valid, but case law
holds that the doctrine does not apply to section 7031 claims. Therefore,
Plaintiff must amend the Complaint to allege facts that show that Plaintiff is
entitled to disgorgement for unlicensed construction work performed within the
one-year statute of limitations. 
 
The demurrer to the third cause of action
is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant
Sultan’s demurrer is sustained with leave to amend. Plaintiff is granted 30
days leave to amend. The court sets the OSC RE: Amended Complaint for June 7,
2024, at 8:30 a.m. Defendant to give notice.
