And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is that Defendant Sultan's demurrer to the third cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. The court finds that Plaintiff's claim for recovery of money paid to an unlicensed contractor is barred by the one-year statute of limitations in Business and Professions Code Section 7031. The court orders Plaintiff to amend the Complaint to allege facts that show that Plaintiff is entitled to disgorgement for unlicensed construction work performed within the one-year statute of limitations. The court sets the OSC RE: Amended Complaint for June 7, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
