And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has denied the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages from the complaint. The defendant argued that the plaintiff failed to allege sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant drove under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs, which is sufficient to show that the defendant acted with malice. The court found that the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged facts to support a claim for punitive damages.
