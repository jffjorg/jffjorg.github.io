[Tentative] Ruling:
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Order Compelling Response and
to Inspection Demand and Imposing Sanctions is GRANTED. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff
Hannah Cho, individually and as trustee of Jonathan and Hannah Cho Trust move
this court for an order compelling Defendant Green Works Construction &
Design, Inc. to permit inspection and copying of documents in accordance with
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 et. seq. and for an order against
Green Works and its attorneys to pay monetary sanctions to Plaintiff. Plaintiff
makes the motion on the grounds Green Works has failed to timely respond at all
to Plaintiff’s inspection demand or produce the documents requested. 
 
If
a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move
for an order compelling response to the demand. (CCP § 2031.300(b); see
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403-404.) The party who must respond has within 30
days after service of a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling to
serve the original response to it on the party making the demand, unless the court
has extended the time for response on motion of the party. (CCP § 2031.260(a).)
Failure to timely respond waived all objections, unless the party to whom the
demand was directed obtains relief from waiver. (CCP §
2031.300(a).)  
 
On
August 11, 2023, Plaintiff served Green Works their Inspection Demand, Set One.
(Weissman Decl. ¶2, Exh. 1.) On September 1, 2023, Green Works requested an
extension, which Plaintiff provided. (Weissman Decl. ¶3, Exh. 2.) After no
responses to the extension, Plaintiff reached out and granted Green Works an
additional extension. (Weissman Decl. ¶3, Exh. 2.) After several extensions,
Green Works has continued to fail to produce any documents to the Demand
Request. (Weissman Decl. ¶4, Exh. 2.) To date, Plaintiff has not received a
single document or formal response to their Demand Inspection. (Weissman Decl.
¶5.) Plaintiff states the critical documents are needed for the prosecution of Cho’s
case and to defend against the affirmative defenses of Defendants herein which
have not been produced. (Weissman Decl. ¶6.) 
 
No
opposition has been filed. Plaintiff’s Motion for Order Compelling Response and to Inspection Demand and Imposing
Sanctions is GRANTED. Green Works is ordered to produce responses and
responsive documents in 20  days without
objection. 
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff seeks $4,915.55 in monetary sanctions
against Green Works for four hours researching and preparing the instant
motion, two hours meeting and conferring, three hours to review any opposition
and prepare a reply at counsel’s hourly rate of $535. (Weissman Decl. ¶7.)
Counsel also seeks $100.55 in filing/service fees. 
 
Plaintiff’s request for attorney fees is granted in
the reduced amount of $2,775.55 (four hours preparing the motion, 1 hour
attending the hearing, and $100.55 in fees). No opposition has been filed and
meeting and conferring with opposing counsel is a professional obligation.
