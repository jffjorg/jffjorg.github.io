Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiff's motion to set aside a default judgment entered against the Defendant, Big Al's LLC, et al. The Court finds that the Defendant is not affiliated with the subject website that formed the basis of the action, and therefore could not be liable for the alleged disability discrimination. As a result, the default judgment is hereby vacated, and the Court sets an Order to Show Cause re Why This Action Should Not Be Dismissed for January 7, 2025. The Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the Court's ruling within five calendar days of this order.
