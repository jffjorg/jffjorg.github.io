  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to seal portions of its
  opposition to motion to quash and exhibits
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Forex Express Corp.,
d/b/a WireCash          
                                                
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Eliran Grushkowsky
Motion to Seal Portions of Opposition to Motion to Quash and Exhibits
The court
considered the moving, limited opposition, and reply papers filed in connection
with this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Forex Express Corp., d/b/a WireCash (“Plaintiff”) moves the
court for an order sealing (1) page 13, lines 2-6 and 9-10 of the opposition
that it filed to defendants Inter & Co. Payments, Inc., and Inter &
Co.’s motion to quash, (2) page 6, lines 10-12 of the declaration of Dr.
Greenspun submitted in support of its opposition, and (3) portions of exhibits
1 and 6 attached to the declaration of Scott C. Ferrier, filed in support of
its opposition to the motion to quash, consisting of, respectively, Plaintiff’s
Second Amended Identification of Trade Secrets and the March 5, 2024
declaration of Geoffrey Mottram.  Defendant Eliran Grushkowsky filed a limited
opposition to Plaintiff’s motion.
Generally, court
records are presumed to be open unless confidentiality is required by law.¿
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550, subd. (c).)¿ If the presumption of access applies,
the court may order that a record be filed under seal “if it expressly finds
facts that establish: (1) There exists an overriding interest that overcomes
the right of public access to the record; (2) The overriding interest supports
sealing the record; (3) A substantial probability exists that the overriding
interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) The proposed
sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) No less restrictive means exist to
achieve the overriding interest.”¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550, subd.
(d).)¿
First, the court
finds, as to page 13, lines 2-6 and 9-10 of the opposition to the motion to
quash filed by Plaintiff on April 17, 2024, that (1) there exists an overriding
interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record because those
portions of the memorandum brief quote information that may consist of
Plaintiff’s trade secret or proprietary information and has been sealed by the
court in its May 31, 2024 order; (2) this
overriding interest supports sealing the record so that Plaintiff’s trade
secret or proprietary information does not become public; (3) a substantial
probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the
record is not sealed; (4) the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored since
Plaintiff requests only that the court seal approximately eight lines of its
opposition; and (5) no less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding
interest.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 2.550, subd. (d).)
Second, the court
finds, as to page 6, lines 10-12 of the declaration of Dr. Greenspun filed by
Plaintiff in support of its opposition to the motion to quash on April 17, 2024,
that (1) there exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public
access to the record because that portion of the declaration quotes information
that may consist of Plaintiff’s trade secret or proprietary information and has
been sealed by the court; (2) this overriding
interest supports sealing the record so that Plaintiff’s trade secret or
proprietary information does not become public; (3) a substantial probability
exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not
sealed; (4) the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored since Plaintiff requests
only that the court seal approximately three lines of the declaration; and (5)
no less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.  (Cal.
Rules of Ct., rule 2.550, subd. (d).)
Third,
the court finds, as to pages i:7, i:9-22, i:22-28, ii:2, ii:4, ii:5-13,
ii:16-28, 1:28-3:8, 4:11-12, 4:14-15, 5:1, 5:2, 6:23-26, 6:28, 7:1-8:5
(excluding the last sentence on page 8:5-7), 8:15-11:22, 11:24-25, 11:26-28, 12:1-14:27,
15:1-17:8, 17:11-20:19, 20:21-28, 21:1-26:21, 27:2-22, 27:25-28:11, 28:13-20,
28:22-29:4, 29:5-31:7, 31:10 (excluding the first sentence on page 31:9-10)
through 34:9, 34:10, 34:12-16, 34:26, 35:1-2, 35:4-20, 35:22, 35:24, 35:25-28,
36:1-21, 36:22-37.5, 37:6-7, 37:8-21, 37:24-25, 37:26-28, 38:1-11, 31:13-40:3,
and 40:7-41:2, and Appendix A, pages A-1:2, A-1:3-4, and A-1:6-A-13:13,
Appendix B, pages B-1:1, B-1:2-3, B-1:4, and B-1:5-B-22:12, and Appendix C,
pages C-1:3 and C-1:5-28 of Plaintiff’s Second Amended Identification of Trade
Secrets, as attached to the declaration of Scott Ferrier as Exhibit 1, filed by
Plaintiff in support of its opposition to the motion to quash on April 17, 2024,
that (1) there exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public
access to the record because those portions of the Second Amended
Identification of Trade Secrets set forth information that may contain
Plaintiff’s trade secret or proprietary information; (2) this overriding
interest supports sealing the record so that Plaintiff’s trade secret or
proprietary information does not become public; (3) a substantial probability
exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not
sealed; (4) the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) no less
restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.  (Cal. Rules
of Ct., rule 2.550, subd. (d).)  
Fourth, the
court finds, as to pages 5:18-25:17 and 26:1-28:23 of the Mottram
Declaration, as attached to the declaration of Scott Ferrier as Exhibit 6, filed
by Plaintiff in support of its opposition to the motion to quash on April 17, 2024,
that (1) there exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public
access to the record because those portions of the Mottram Declaration quote,
reference, or discuss information that may contain Plaintiff’s trade secret or
proprietary information; (2) this overriding interest supports sealing the
record so that Plaintiff’s trade secret or proprietary information does not
become public; (3) a substantial probability exists that the overriding
interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) the proposed
sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) no less restrictive means exist to
achieve the overriding interest.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 2.550, subd.
(d).)  
The court
therefore grants Plaintiff’s motion to seal the portions of its opposition to
the motion to quash and the exhibits filed in support of its opposition set
forth above.
