And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a medical malpractice case, where the plaintiff, Hong Gan, is seeking to set aside a judgment and dismissal entered against him on April 30, 2024 and July 30, 2024, respectively. The judge has deemed the motion to set aside judgment as moot due to pending appeals of the April 30, 2024 and July 30, 2024 orders. The judge has also taken the motion off-calendar due to the pending appeals. The judge's ruling is based on the doctrine of res judicata, which bars the plaintiff from relitigating the same issues. The judge has also considered the plaintiff's procedural defects in filing the motion, including insufficient notice and defective notice of motion. The judge has reminded the plaintiff of his obligation to comply with the Code of Civil Procedure and California Rules of Court.
