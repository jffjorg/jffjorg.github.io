  Case Number:  23AHCV00462    Hearing Date:   September 4, 2024    Dept:  P ORDER
DEEMING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO SET ASIDE JUDGMENT AS MOOT AND TAKING THE HEARING
ON THE MOTION OFF-CALENDARI.        INTRODUCTION
           This is an action arising from alleged medical
malpractice. On March 6, 2023, Plaintiff Hong Gan (“Plaintiff”), who is
self-represented, filed a Complaint against Defendant San Gabriel Valley
Medical Center.  
           On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendant San Gabriel Valley Medical Center
alleging causes of action for: (1) Intentional Tort, Sexual Abuse; (2)
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (3) Negligence; (4) False
Involuntary Detention in a Mental Hospital; and (5) Patient Rights Violation.  
           On November 14, 2023, Defendant AHMC San Gabriel Valley
Medical Center LP filed a demurrer to the entire FAC.   
           On April 30, 2024, after hearing oral argument, the Court
sustained Defendant AHMC San Gabriel Valley Medical Center LP’s demurrer to the
FAC without leave to amend on the grounds that this action is barred by the
doctrine of res judicata. (04/30/24 Minute Order.) 
           On March 27, 2024, this action was reassigned to the
Honorable Jared D. Moses sitting in Department P at Pasadena Courthouse
effective April 2, 2024. 
           On June 3, 2024, Defendant San Gabriel Valley Medical
Center LP (“Defendant”), who indicates that it was erroneously sued as San
Gabriel Valley Medical Center, filed and served a Motion to Have Plaintiff
Declared a Vexatious Litigant. 
           Also, on June 3, 2024, Defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss
Action Pursuant to CCP § 581(f)(1). 
           On July 30, 2024, after hearing oral argument, the Court
granted Defendant’s Motion to Have Plaintiff Declared a Vexatious Litigant.
(07/30/24 Minute Order.) Also, on July 30, 2024, after hearing oral argument,
the Court granted Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss. (07/30/24 Minute Order.) 
           On July 30, 2024, the Court entered an Order of Dismissal
and dismissed this action with prejudice pursuant to CCP § 581(f)(1). 
           On August 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal,
which indicates that Plaintiff is appealing this Court’s April 30, 2024 order. 
           On August 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to
Set Aside Judgment (the “Motion”). Plaintiff requests that the Court set aside its
April 30, 2024 and July 30, 2024 orders. 
           On August 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal,
which indicates that Plaintiff is appealing the Court’s July 30, 2024 order of
dismissal. 
           On August 21, 2024, Defendant filed and served an
opposition to the Motion. In the opposition, Defendant’s counsel indicates that
the Motion was served on Defendant via email on Saturday, August 17, 2024.
(Pawley Decl., ¶ 5.) 
           On August 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed a proof of service
showing that the Motion was served on Defendant on August 17, 2024 by
electronic service. 
           As of August 30, 2024, no reply brief has been filed. Any
reply brief was required to have been filed and served at least five court days
prior to the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 
 
II.       LEGAL
STANDARD        
“The court may, upon any
terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) “Application for . . . relief shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding was taken.” (Ibid.) “It is well
settled that appellate courts have always been and are favorably disposed
toward such action upon the part of the trial courts as will permit, rather
than prevent, the adjudication of legal controversies upon their merits.” (Benjamin
v. Dalmo Mfg. Co. (1948) 31 Cal.2d 523, 525.)   
 
III.     ANALYSIS
           
A.   Judicial
Notice
The Court GRANTS
Defendant’s request for judicial notice. (Evid. Code §§ 452, 
453.) 
 
B.    Procedural
Defects in Plaintiff’s Motion 

Defendant contends the Motion should be denied
because Plaintiff served the Motion with insufficient notice. 
“Unless otherwise ordered or specifically provided
by law, all moving and supporting papers shall be served and filed at least 16
court days before the hearing. The moving and supporting papers served shall be
a copy of the papers filed or to be filed with the court.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1005, subd. (b).) “Any period of notice, or any right or duty to do any act or
make any response within any period . . . after the service of the document,
which time period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of court, shall be
extended after service by electronic means by two court days . . . .” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).) 
Here, the Court finds that the Motion is
procedurally improper as Plaintiff did not file and serve the Motion with
sufficient notice to Defendant. Plaintiff did not file and serve the Motion
with enough time for Defendant to sufficiently prepare a response pursuant to
CCP §§ 1005(b) and 1010.6(a)(3)(B).) 
Further, the Court finds that the Notice of Motion
is defective as Plaintiff did not set forth “[t]he date [or] time” of the
hearing on the Motion. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1110(b)(1).)  
The Court recognizes that Plaintiff is
self-represented; however, Plaintiff is still held to the same standard as an
attorney. (Kobayashi v. Superior Court (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 536, 543.)
Plaintiff is reminded to comply with the requirements of the Code of Civil
Procedure and California Rules of Court. 
 
C.   The Effect
of the Pending Appeals 
Although not raised as an
argument in the opposition brief, the Court will address
Plaintiff’s pending appeals.  
           “[T]he
perfecting of an appeal stays proceedings in the trial court upon the judgment
or order appealed from or upon the matters embraced therein or affected
thereby, including enforcement of the judgment or order, but the trial court
may proceed upon any other matter embraced in the action and not affected by
the judgment or order.” (Varian Medical Systems, Inc.
v. Delfino (2005) 35 Cal.4th 180, 189.) “The purpose of the
automatic stay provision of section 916, subdivision (a) is to protect the
appellate court’s jurisdiction by preserving the status quo until the appeal is
decided. The [automatic stay] prevents the trial court from rendering the appeal
futile by altering the appealed judgment or order by conducting other
proceedings that may affect it.” (Ibid.)

           Here,
Plaintiff is appealing the Court’s April 30, 2024, and July 30, 2024 orders which,
collectively, sustained Defendant’s demurrer to the FAC without leave to amend
and dismissed this action. The Motion seeks to set aside the Court’s April 30,
2024 and July 30, 2024 orders. It follows that the Court’s April 30, 2024 order
and July 30, 2024 order are both embraced in the pending appeals. Ruling on the
Motion may subject the parties to inconsistent rulings depending on the outcome
of the appeals. It is possible that the Second District Court of Appeal may
reverse the Court’s April 30, 2024 order and July 30, 2024 order. The Court
therefore “is without power to proceed further as to any matter embraced
therein until the appeal is determined.” (Varian Medical
Systems, Inc. v. Delfino, supra,
35 Cal.4th 180, 197.) The Court ruling on a motion to set aside the Court’s
April 30, 2024 and July 30, 2024 orders—while appeals of such orders are
pending—would render such orders a nullity under Davis v.
Thayer (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 892, 912. 
           Irrespective
of the defects concerning service and notice of the Motion, the Court cannot
rule on the Motion at this time due to the pending appeals. To do so would
possibility subject the parties to inconsistent rulings depending on the
outcome of the appeals.  
 
IV.     
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s Motion to
Set Aside Judgment is MOOT and is taken OFF-CALENDAR due to the pending appeals.
           Defendant to give notice of this order.
