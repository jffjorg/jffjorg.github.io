 Case Number:  23SMCV03675    Hearing Date:   March 26, 2024    Dept:  I The court does not fully understand this motion.  The motion is to set aside the default, and
it is unopposed.  For that reason, the
court is inclined to GRANT the motion if defendant can establish that he served
the motion on plaintiff (there is no adequate proof of service to that
effect).  But that said, it seems that
plaintiff seeks only possession of the property—which it has—and is not seeking
financial recourse.  One might argue that
the entire case is moot.  On the merits,
defendant states that service was made on an address that was not where he
lived—he had already vacated it.  He
submits a change of address form he filed with the Post Office as evidence
thereof.  Assuming the truth of that,
then the substituted service is not sufficient and the motion should be
GRANTED.  The issue is one of mootness,
but the court can well understand why a party would not want a UD judgment
against it, even if there is no jural effect to it and the court would be
inclined to grant the motion if that is the problem.
