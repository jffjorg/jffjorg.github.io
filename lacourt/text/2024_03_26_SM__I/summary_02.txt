And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is about a motion to set aside a default in a court case. The case is unopposed, meaning the plaintiff is not opposing the motion. The judge is inclined to grant the motion if the defendant can show that he served the motion on the plaintiff. However, the judge notes that the plaintiff is only seeking possession of property, which they already have, and is not seeking financial damages. The defendant argues that the service was made at an address where he no longer lived, and provides a change of address form filed with the Post Office as evidence. If this is true, then the substituted service is not sufficient and the motion should be granted. The judge notes that the issue is one of mootness, but would still be inclined to grant the motion if it is the problem.
