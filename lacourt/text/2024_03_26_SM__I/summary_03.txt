  - "There is just no 'there there.'"
```

And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has reviewed the evidence and is inclined to grant the motion to compel arbitration and stay the litigation as between Horne and the plaintiff pending arbitration. The court finds that Horne's involvement in 2021 was minimal and fleeting, and there is no evidence of joint responsibility or tax advice. The judge is aware that the test for denying the motion is whether there is a realistic possibility of inconsistent judgments, but in this case, the court does not see it. The court will discuss with the plaintiff and Horne the theoretical scenario under which inconsistent judgments could occur, but as a practical matter, given the facts, the court does not see it.
