            The Court has considered the moving papers.

BACKGROUND
            This action arises from the alleged
breach of a lease agreement concerning a residential real property located at 4077
W. 3rd Street, #628, Los Angeles, California 90020 (the “Premises”).
 On May 19, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint
for Damages for Breach of Written Lease (the “Complaint”) against Defendant Deangelo
Greene (“Defendant”) and DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, alleging a sole cause of
action for Breach of Lease.  
 
The
Complaint alleges the following: On or about March 24, 2020, Plaintiff, as
landlord, and Defendant, as tenant, entered into a written lease agreement (the
“Lease”) concerning the Premises.  (Complaint,
¶ 5.)  Pursuant to Paragraph 6 of the
Lease, Defendant is obligated to pay a monthly base rent of $965.00, plus
additional charges due under the Lease.  (Complaint, ¶ 7.)  Plaintiff alleges that in or about October 2020
and continuing thereafter, Defendant breached the Lease, by, among other
things, failing to pay rent and other charges due under the Lease. (Complaint,
¶ 9.)   
 
On
May 26, 2023, Defendant filed an Answer—Unlawful Detainer to the
Complaint.   
 
On
June 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served the instant Motion for Summary
Judgment (the “Motion”).  No opposition
to the Motion has been filed.
 
DISCUSSION
Legal Standard
The function of a motion for summary judgment or
adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot
show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of
summary dismissal without the need for trial.  (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  Code Civ.
Proc. § 437c(c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler
v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)  “The function of the pleadings in a motion for
summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the
affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of
fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.”  (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12
Cal.App.4th 59, 67.) 
 
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial
burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there
are no triable issues of material fact.”  (Scalf v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.)  “A
plaintiff . . . has met his or her burden of showing there is no defense to a
cause of action if that party has proved each element of the cause of action
entitling the party to judgment on that cause of action.”  (Troyk v. Farmers Group, Inc. (2009)
171 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1320.)  A plaintiff
is not required “to disprove any defense asserted by the defendant as well as
prove each element of his own cause of action.” (WRI Opportunity Loans II,
LLC v. Cooper (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 525, 531-32.)  “Once the plaintiff makes an adequate initial
showing, the burden shifts to the defendant to show a triable issue of fact as
to that cause of action or a defense thereto.”  (Id. at p. 532; CCP § 437c(p)(1).)  
 
“There is a triable issue of material fact if, and
only if, the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the
underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with
the applicable standard of proof.”  (Aguilar,
25 Cal.4th at 850.)  The defendant “shall
not rely upon the¿allegations or denials of its pleadings to show that a
triable issue of material fact exists but, instead, shall set forth the
specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as
to¿the¿cause of action or a defense thereto.” 
(CCP § 437c(p)(1).) 
 
Analysis 
“The standard elements of a claim for breach of
contract are: ‘(1) the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) damage to plaintiff
therefrom.’” (Wall Street Network, Ltd. v. New York Times Co. (2008) 164
Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178; San Mateo Union High School Dist. v. County of San
Mateo (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 418, 439.) 

 
Plaintiff presents the following undisputed material
facts: On or about August 24, 2020, Plaintiff’s predecessor-in-interest, as landlord,
and Defendant, as tenant, entered into the Lease for the Premises.  Plaintiff is the current owner of the Premises
and lessor.  (UMF No. 1.)  Pursuant to Paragraph 6 of the Lease,
Defendant was and is currently obligated to pay a monthly base rent of $965.00
and Defendant is also responsible for paying all utilities except electricity
pursuant to Paragraph 9 of the Lease.  (UMF No. 2.)  Plaintiff has performed all conditions of the
Lease required of it except those conditions in which Plaintiff’s
nonperformance thereof was excused or justified.  (UMF No. 3.)  Defendant’s failure to pay, among other
things, the rent due under the Lease has excused Plaintiffs from any other
obligations under the Lease.  (Id.)
 In or about October 2020 and continuing
thereafter, Defendant breached the Lease by, among other things, failing to pay
rent and other charges due under the Lease.  (UMF No. 4.) The total billed unpaid rental
damages—base rent and utilities—through March 21, 2024 (the date Defendant
vacated the Premises) is $30,192.11.  (UMF
No. 5.)  
 
Initially, the Court notes that the term of the
Lease as set forth therein was one year, from August 25, 2020 to August 24,
2021.  (Declaration of Violeta Vitkova (“Vitkova
Decl.”), Exhibit “A”, para. 5.)  Under
paragraph 5 of the Lease: “A ‘month-to-month tenancy subject to the terms and
conditions of this Lease shall be created only if Owner [Plaintiff] accepts
rent from Resident [Defendant] thereafter.” 
According to Exhibit B to the Vitkova Decl., Plaintiff or its
predecessor accepted a payment from Defendant on November 30, 2021 – after the
end of the Lease term.  (See, Vitaly
Decl., Exh. B, p. 3.)  Therefore,
Defendant had a month-to-month tenancy under the terms of the Lease until he
vacated the premises.  Based upon this circumstance,
which appears on the face of the evidence presented, the calculation of rent
due is correct. 
            The Court therefore finds
that there are no factual issues regarding Plaintiff’s claims.  Plaintiff has established the existence of a
lease agreement between the parties.  Plaintiff
has also submitted sufficient evidence to establish Defendant’s breach of the
agreement with respect to the failure to pay rent, as well as the amount of
damages proximately caused by said breach.. 
 
Plaintiff has thus met its burden of showing the
existence of each element for the cause of action for breach of lease.  The burden now shifts to Defendant to show a
triable issue of material fact.  
 
Defendant has presented no evidence to controvert
the facts as presented by Plaintiff.  Because
Defendant has failed to oppose the Motion, Defendant has conceded to the
arguments raised therein, as “[c]ontentions are waived when a party fails to
support them with reasoned argument and citations to authority.”  (Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v. Colombo
(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215.)  Defendant,
therefore, has not met his burden in showing the existence of a triable issue
of material fact as to a cause of action or defense thereto.   
 
Accordingly, the Court finds there are no triable
issues of material fact and Plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of
law.
 
RULING
Based on the foregoing, the Motion is GRANTED.  
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling and to prepare a proposed form
of Judgment which shall be lodged with the Court and served on Defendant within
twenty (20) days of the date of this order.        
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
