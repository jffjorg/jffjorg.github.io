And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion for summary judgment filed by the plaintiff, Omnitel Kipling, L.P. (Plaintiff), against the defendant, Deangelo Greene (Defendant). The motion is unopposed, as the defendant failed to file an opposition.

The court finds that there are no triable issues of material fact regarding the plaintiff's claims. The plaintiff has established the existence of a lease agreement between the parties, and has submitted sufficient evidence to establish the defendant's breach of the agreement with respect to the failure to pay rent, as well as the amount of damages proximately caused by said breach.

The court finds that the plaintiff has met its burden of showing the existence of each element of the cause of action for breach of lease. Therefore, the burden shifts to the defendant to show a triable issue of material fact. However, the defendant has presented no evidence to controvert the facts as presented by the plaintiff, and has conceded to the arguments raised in the motion.

Accordingly, the court grants the motion for summary judgment and finds that the defendant is liable for breach of lease. The court orders the plaintiff to prepare a proposed form of judgment, which shall be lodged with the court and served on the defendant within 20 days of the date of this order.
