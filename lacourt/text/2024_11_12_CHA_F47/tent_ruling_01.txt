RULING: The motion is granted as set forth
below.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
 
This action arises out of an automobile accident that
occurred on 11/13/20.  Plaintiffs Brian
Avalos, Eva Sanchez Avalos and Alejandra Jimenez (collectively, Plaintiffs)
allege that Defendant Eddie Camargo caused the accident which resulted in
Plaintiffs suffering personal injuries and property damage to Plaintiff Eva
Sanchez Avalos. Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Ruth Pelayo aka Ruth Vazquez
aka Ruth Camargo (Ruth Pelayo) is one of or the only owner of the vehicle
driven by Eddie Camargo and involved in the accident on 11/13/20. 
 
On 11/8/22, Plaintiffs filed this action against Eddie
Camargo and Ruth Pelayo for: (1) General Negligence (against Eddie Camargo),
(2) Motor Vehicle Negligence (against Eddie Camargo), (3) Negligent Infliction
of Emotional Distress (against Eddie Camargo), (4) Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress (against Eddie Camargo), (5) Permissive Use Statute Claim
(Vehicle Code Section 17149) (against Ruth Pelayo), and (6) Negligent
Entrustment (against Ruth Pelayo). 
Plaintiffs have since dismissed the 4th cause of action for
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.
 
On 12/14/23, Plaintiff Brian Avalos served Defendant Eddie
Camargo with Request for Production of Documents, Set 1.  (O’Hara Decl., Ex.A).  On 1/16/24, 
Eddie Camargo served responses and objections to the discovery requests
without verification.  (Id., Ex.B,
C).  Counsel for the parties met and
conferred regarding the discovery responses. 
(Id., Ex.C)
 
On 2/26/24, the parties stipulated to continue the then
8/19/24 trial date.  Within that
stipulation, it was stated that Defendants intended to serve verifications and
further responses to five sets of written discovery propounded by Plaintiffs.  As a result, the Court ordered the trial date
continued to 2/24/25 and ordered the discovery deadlines and cut-offs to
correspond to the new trial date. (See 2/26/24 Stipulation & Order).  Despite further meet and confer efforts,
neither further responses nor a verification have been served.  (O’Hara Decl., Ex.C, F).  Thereafter, pursuant to Plaintiffs’ motion,
the trial date was continued to 8/25/25. 
(See 9/11/24 Minute Order).
 
As of the filing of the motion on 8/7/24, neither further
responses nor a verification have been served regarding the subject discovery.  (O’Hara Decl.).  Therefore, on 8/7/24, Plaintiff Brian Avalos
filed and served the instant motion seeking an order compelling Defendant Eddie
Camargo to serve a verification and further responses to Plaintiff Brian
Avalos’ Request for Production of Documents, Set 1, Requests 1-10.  Additionally, Plaintiff Brian Avalos requests
sanctions be imposed against Defendant Eddie Camargo and defense counsel,
Khelya M. Okunor, jointly and severally, in the amount of $2,660.00.  No opposition or other response to the motion
has been filed.  However, on 11/8/24,
Plaintiffs’ counsel filed a declaration in response to Defendant Eddie Camargo’s
Further Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set 1.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
The Request for Judicial Notice is denied.  Since the Stipulation and Order which is the
subject of the request is part of the court file, the Court finds it
unnecessary to take judicial notice of same. 

 
The broad scope of discovery allows a party to “obtain
discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject
matter involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion
made in that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or
appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”  CCP 2017.010.
 
CCP 2031.310(a) provides:
 
“On receipt of a response to a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may
move for an order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding
party deems that any of the following apply: 
(1) A statement of compliance with
the demand is incomplete. 
(2) A representation of inability
to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. 
(3) An objection in the response is
without merit or too general.”
 
Since the subject responses include facts and objections
and no verification has been served, the 45-day limit to bring the motion never
began to run.  See Golf &
Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. (2022) 84 CA5th 127, 134-136; CCP 2031.310(c).  To the extent the responses included facts
which needed a verification which was never provided, they are the equivalent
to no response.  See Appleton
(1988) 206 CA3d 632, 635-636.
 
If a timely motion to compel further responses is filed,
the responding party has the burden of justifying any objection.  Fairmont Insurance Co. (2000) 22 C4th 245,
255; Coy (1962) 58 C2d 210, 220-221; Williams  (2017) 3 C5th 531, 541-542.  
 
Rather than respond to the instant motion, it appears
that Eddie Camargo served further responses to the subject discovery requests
on 11/4/24.  (See O’Hara Decl.
filed 11/8/24, Ex.A).  The verification for
such further responses is defective in that it is dated 10/28/24, before the
further responses were prepared and dated on 11/1/24.  (Id., Ex.B).  As such, the further responses are the
equivalent to no response.  See Appleton,
supra. 
 
Eddie Camargo has failed to justify any of the objections
made in the initial responses to the discovery requests.  As noted above, the facts interposed in the
initial response to some of the requests are not verified making them
tantamount to no response.  Additionally,
such responses are inadequate and/or evasive. 
  
 
The discovery requests seek information relevant to the
issues in this case.  Eddie Camargo has
failed to justify the objections included in his initial responses and the
factual information in the initial responses is unverified, inadequate and/or
evasive.  Further, Eddie Camargo has
failed to properly verify the further responses to the subject discovery served
on 11/4/24.  (See O’Hara Decl.
filed 11/8/24, Ex.A, B).  As such, those
responses are tantamount to no response. 
  
 
The imposition of sanctions is also warranted against Eddie
Camargo and his attorney, Khelya M. Okunor, for
their failure to comply with their discovery obligations.  CCP 2031.310(h),  However, the Court finds the $2,660.00
requested is excessive.  As such,
sanctions in the amount of $2,060.00 (2 hours to prepare the motion + 1 hour to
review the further responses and prepare additional declaration + 1 hour to prepare
for and appear at the hearing multiplied by $500/hour + $60 filing fee) are
imposed jointly and severally on Eddie Camargo and his
attorney, Khelya M. Okunor, in favor of Plaintiffs’ counsel, Colleen O’Hara.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
Further properly verified responses and production of documents are due
within 30 days.  Sanctions are imposed
against Defendant Eddie Camargo and his attorney, Khelya M. Okunor, in favor of
Plaintiffs’ counsel, Colleen O’Hara, in the amount of $2,060.00, payable within
30 days.
 
If Eddie Camargo serves a proper verification for the further
responses served on 11/4/24  before the
hearing, the request to compel further responses will be rendered moot.  If Plaintiff Brian Avalos is not satisfied
with certain of those responses as indicated in the declaration of his counsel
filed on 11/8/24, meet and confer efforts must be made with regard to such
further responses and if the matter cannot be resolved informally, a motion
which specifically addresses those further responses must be timely filed and
served with a proper separate statement. 
(See below). 
 
Regardless of whether a proper verification is served
before the hearing, sanctions are still warranted and will be imposed as set
forth above. 
The Court notes that Plaintiffs’ counsel has failed to
electronically bookmark the exhibits submitted in support of the motion in
violation of CRC 3.1110(f)(4).  Counsel
for the parties are warned that failure to comply with this rule in the future
may result in matters being continued so that papers can be refiled in
compliance with the rule, papers not being considered and/or the imposition of
sanctions. 
 
Additionally, the Court notes that the separate statement
is not in the proper format.  CRC 3.1345(c)
provides in relevant part:
 
“The separate statement must
include--for each discovery request (e.g., each interrogatory, request for
admission, deposition question, or inspection demand) to which a further
response, answer, or production is requested--the following:
(1) The text of the request,
interrogatory, question, or inspection demand;
(2) The text of each response,
answer, or objection, and any further responses or answers;
(3) A statement of the factual and
legal reasons for compelling further responses, answers, or production as to
each matter in dispute;
(4) If necessary, the text of all
definitions, instructions, and other matters required to understand each
discovery request and the responses to it;
(5) If the response to a particular
discovery request is dependent on the response given to another discovery
request, or if the reasons a further response to a particular discovery request
is deemed necessary are based on the response to some other discovery request,
the other request and the response to it must be set forth; and
(6) If the pleadings, other
documents in the file, or other items of discovery are relevant to the motion,
the party relying on them must summarize each relevant document.”
 
Here, the separate statement merely sets forth Eddie
Camargo’s responses to the document requests, verbatim, and then reiterates,
verbatim, the motion’s memorandum and points and authorities.  In the future, counsel must follow the format
set forth in CRC 3.1345(c) by addressing each discovery request individually
and not including extraneous information/arguments (i.e., statement of facts,
sanctions).
