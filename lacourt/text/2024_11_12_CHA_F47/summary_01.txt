**Significant Statements**
```
"The broad scope of discovery allows a party to 'obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion made in that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.'"
"The discovery requests seek information relevant to the issues in this case. Eddie Camargo has failed to justify the objections included in his initial responses and the factual information in the initial responses is unverified, inadequate and/or evasive."
"The imposition of sanctions is also warranted against Eddie Camargo and his attorney, Khelya M. Okunor, for their failure to comply with their discovery obligations."
