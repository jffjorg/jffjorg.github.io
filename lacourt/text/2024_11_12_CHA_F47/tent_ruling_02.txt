RELIEF REQUESTED: An order relieving Kyle P.
Schneberg as counsel for Plaintiff Aaron Ferreras through his conservator,

RULING: The motion is placed off calendar.  
 
On 4/8/24, attorney Kyle P. Schneberg filed the instant
motion seeking an order relieving him as counsel for Plaintiff Aaron Ferreras
through his conservator, Lynette Ferreras (Plaintiff).  The attorney notes that a court order is
necessary for his office to withdraw since Aaron Ferreras lacks legal capacity
and may not be represented by his conservator. 
(See Declaration, No.2). 
The attorney also indicates that as of the filing of the motion on
4/8/24, Plaintiff was searching for new counsel.  Id. 
A substitution of attorney has not been filed as to Aaron Ferreras.  No other reason for the withdrawal is
provided.
 
There is no proof of service for the motion and no
response has been filed by Plaintiff/Plaintiff’s conservator to cure the defect.
 
Additionally, the attorney has failed to set forth the
address of the client on the first page of the notice of motion as
required.  The attorney has also failed
to set forth the telephone number for the client in number 6 of the proposed
order.
