And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the Petition to Compel Arbitration without prejudice because there is no proof of service demonstrating that Respondent was notified about the action or given proper notice of the hearing. The court finds that the Petitioner has not complied with the service rules and has not provided written notice of the hearing to the Respondent at least 16 court days before the hearing, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1005. The court orders the Petitioner to provide notice of the court's order and file a proof of service of the same.
