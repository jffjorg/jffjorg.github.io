And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set 1. The plaintiff failed to engage in a reasonable and good faith attempt to informally resolve the discovery issues before filing the motion. The judge finds that the plaintiff's meet and confer efforts were inadequate and did not fulfill the plaintiff's obligations under the Discovery Act. As a result, the plaintiff engaged in the misuse of the discovery process and is not entitled to monetary sanctions.
