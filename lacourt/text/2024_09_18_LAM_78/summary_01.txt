And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to tax costs in the employment case. The court grants the motion in part and strikes $2,522.92 of the costs claimed by the plaintiffs. The court awards the plaintiffs a total of $12,242.41 in costs. The court finds that some of the costs claimed by the plaintiffs are not recoverable under the Code of Civil Procedure, and the plaintiffs have failed to provide sufficient evidence to justify those costs. The court also finds that the defendant has not shown that the costs associated with service of deposition and trial subpoenas were unreasonable. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the court's ruling.
