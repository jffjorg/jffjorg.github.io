And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's request to quiet title to the property located at 1532 West 110 Street in Los Angeles, California. The plaintiff, Thelma Patrick, is seeking to establish her sole ownership of the property, which was refinanced in 2012. The defendant, Melania Hurtado, is the co-trustee of the 1532 West 110th Street Trust, but has not signed off on her interest in the property.

The judge finds that the plaintiff has provided sufficient evidence to establish her title to the property and therefore grants the quiet title action. However, the judge denies the plaintiff's request for damages related to the second cause of action for financial elder abuse, as the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to support a cognizable claim.

The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for declaratory relief, which would have required the court to declare that the plaintiff is not liable for any loans, liens, or attachments to the purported "The 1532 West 110th Trust." Finally, the judge awards the plaintiff costs in the amount of $1,289.50.
