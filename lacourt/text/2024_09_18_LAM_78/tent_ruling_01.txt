[TENTATIVE] RULING
  RE: DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO TAX COSTS
 
 
 



 
 
 
The Court grants the motion in part
and strikes
$2,522.92, awarding Plaintiffs $12,242.41 in total costs.
BACKGROUND
This is an employment case. On June
6, 2024, the Court entered judgment for Plaintiffs after jury trial. On June
26, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their Memorandum of Costs, claiming total costs of
$14,765.33. On July 2, 2024, Defendant moved to tax Plaintiffs’ costs claim.
Plaintiffs filed their opposition on September 5, 2024. On September 9, 2024,
Defendant replied.
LEGAL STANDARD
          “Except as otherwise expressly
provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to
recover costs in any action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd.
(b).) “If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the
burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not
reasonable or necessary. On the other hand, if the items are properly objected
to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them
as costs.” (Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th
761, 774.)

DISCUSSION
          Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5
enumerates specific recoverable costs (subd. (a)), non-recoverable costs
(subd. (b)), and a standard by which a court may determine whether to award
those costs not enumerated (subd. (c)).
          Defendant has placed nearly three
pages of costs at issue. The Court categorizes them as follows for the sake of
brevity:




Item


Category


Cost




1.


CRS, CourtCall, and CourtConnect fees


$216.65




2.


Mileage and Court Parking


$394.52




3.


Mediation Costs


$1,005.00




4.


Cancelled Deposition Costs


$596.00




5.


Trial Supplies


$1,603.40




6.


“PAGA Complaint”


$75.00




7.


“Asset & Legal Research”


$450.00




          Defendant also seeks to reduce, but
not strike, the costs associated with five subpoenas that were not enforced
against trial or deposition witnesses.
          Beginning with the plain terms of
section 1033.5: filing and motion fees, which the Court regards to include
remote appearance fees, are recoverable. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(1).) The
motion is denied as to Item No. 1. 
          Deposition costs are also covered. Defendant
argues in its papers that one deposition referred to in Item No. 4 was not
attended and therefore not reasonably necessary, but Defendant offers no
evidence to prove as much. Where a cost bill appears proper, as it does for
Item 4, it is Defendant’s burden to show the costs are unreasonable. They have
not carried it. The motion is denied as to Item No. 4.
          Defendant similarly offers no evidence
that the mediation fees here were unreasonable. Mediation costs are recoverable
in a civil proceeding. (See Berkeley Cement, Inc. v. Regents of University
of California (2019) 30 Cal.App.5th 1133, 1140.) Defendant’s citation to Gibson
v. Bobroff  (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th
1202, 1206 is nearly sanctionable; the case stands for the opposite
proposition. Also, Counsel does not attest that the parties agreed to split
mediation costs. A mediator does not have the power to make an award, so the
Court would expect some evidence of a stipulation to split costs. The motion
is denied as to Item No. 3.
          As to Items 2, 5, 6, and 7, the costs
are not clearly proper. Section 1033.5 does not expressly permit recovery of
travel expenses except for travel to depositions. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(3)(C).)  “Trial supplies” are largely not recoverable,
except for trial exhibits necessary to assist the trier of fact. (See id.,
subds. (a)(13) [models, photocopying of exhibits recoverable], (b)(2)
[photocopying charges not recoverable except for exhibits].) “PAGA Complaint”
and “Asset & Legal Research” do not clearly fall into any permissible or
impermissible category.
          Because Items 2, 5, 6, and 7 are not
proper on their face, it is Plaintiffs’ burden to justify them. They have not.
Counsel’s declaration accompanying Plaintiffs’ deposition explains little, if
anything, about the necessity of the relevant costs. As to Items 2, 5, 6,
and 7, the motion is granted.
          Finally, the Court also finds service
of deposition and trial subpoenas on four proposed witnesses was not
unreasonable, even if their depositions were not taken and they did not testify
at trial. Defendant has not shown otherwise. Service fees are prima facie
recoverable (id., subd. (a)(4)), so the burden rests with Defendant. The
motion is denied as to Defendant’s proposed cost reductions.
ORDER
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion to
tax costs is granted in part. The
Court strikes $2,522.92 of the costs in Plaintiffs’ memorandum and awards
Plaintiffs $12,242.41 in costs.
Defendant to give notice.
