```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to vacate the order compelling arbitration and for attorneys' fees. The court found that the defendant failed to pay fees required to continue with the arbitration, which satisfies the conditions of Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.98. The court also found that the defendant's failure to pay fees within 30 days of the due date resulted in a material breach of the arbitration agreement and waived its right to compel the arbitration. The court awarded the plaintiff $400 in JAMS filing fees and set a status conference for the parties to submit a joint status report.

Note: The judge's tentative ruling may be subject to change before it becomes a final ruling.
