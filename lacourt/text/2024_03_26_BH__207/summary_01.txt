And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for reconsideration filed by the plaintiff, Yazmin Ortiz. The motion is based on new information and circumstances, including the plaintiff's discovery of the need to provide the court with sufficient facts, such as case numbers, to analyze her contentions that two other cases she filed were dismissed with instructions to re-file those claims in this case for purposes of consolidation.

However, the judge finds that the new information and circumstances do not constitute a good reason for reconsideration. The judge notes that the plaintiff's narrative about the two other cases being dismissed with instructions to re-file causes of action in this case is not supported by evidence, and that the plaintiff did not seek an entry of default despite the defendants' delay in answering the operative complaint.

The judge also finds that the defendants' recent answer to the operative complaint does not prejudice the plaintiff, as the plaintiff has not been harmed by the delay and the parties have continued to prepare for trial. As a result, the judge denies the motion for reconsideration.
