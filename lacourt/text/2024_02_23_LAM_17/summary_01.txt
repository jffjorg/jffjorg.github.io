And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motions to compel further responses to its Requests for Admission (RFAs), Form Interrogatories (FROGs), and Requests for Production (RFPs). The defendants' responses to these requests were incomplete, evasive, and unverified. The judge found that the defendants' responses failed to provide relevant information and did not meet the requirements of the law.

The judge has also sanctioned the defendants, jointly and severally with their counsel, in the amount of $1,400. The responses are due within 10 days, and the sanctions are payable within 30 days.

The case involves a dispute between the plaintiff, CBD Franchising, Inc., and the defendant, Central Jersey Doors & Closets, LLC, regarding a breach of contract and other alleged wrongs. The plaintiff filed suit in April 2022 and the defendants responded to the plaintiff's requests for information in November 2023. However, the defendants' responses were found to be incomplete and evasive, prompting the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses.
