And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in this case, overruling the defendant's demurrer. The plaintiff, Eva Mejia, alleges that the defendant, Top Shelf Concierge Services, LLC, discriminated against her based on her gender-related appearance and anatomical characteristics assigned to her at birth, resulting in her not being hired for an office assistant position. The defendant argues that the plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to support her claims, but the Court disagrees. The Court finds that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to support her claims of discrimination, including the alleged offer and revocation of the job offer, and the text messages in which the defendant's male owner stated that the reason for not hiring the plaintiff was due to her "attractiveness and big boobs". The Court also finds that the defendant's conduct violates the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) and California law. The Court's tentative ruling is that the defendant's demurrer is overruled, and the case will proceed to the next stage.
