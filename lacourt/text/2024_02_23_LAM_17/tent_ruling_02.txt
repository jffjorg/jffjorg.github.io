  No.:  22STCV20693 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: February 23, 2024



 
 
Defendants’
motion to compel Plaintiff to appear for deposition is GRANTED. Plaintiff is to
appear for deposition within 20 days of entry of this order, at Defense
counsel's office located at 10960 Wilshire Blvd, 18th Floor, in Los Angeles,
California. Plaintiff is sanctioned, jointly and severally with counsel, $1,100,
payable within 20 days.
 
On 6/24/2022,
Plaintiff Alfredo Lopez (Plaintiff) filed suit against Martin L. Berman, Esq.,
Law Offices of Pflaster & Berman, and Edward J. Siegler, Esq., alleging:
(1) legal malpractice; and (2) breach of fiduciary duty. 
 
            On
2/9/2023, Defendants Martin L. Berman, Esq. and Law Offices of Pflaster &
Berman moved to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Alfredo Lopez. They also seek
monetary sanctions. 
 
            The
motion is unopposed. 
 
Discussion  
 
            The
deposition of Plaintiff Alfredo Lopez was first noticed for October 18, 2023.
Although the deposition was timely noticed, Plaintiff did not appear for the
deposition. (Id., ¶ 3.) No objection to the deposition notice was
served. (Ibid.) Instead, Plaintiff's counsel sent an email
correspondence two days before the scheduled deposition (and only after Defense
counsel sent a confirming email), advising that the deposition was not going
forward. (Id., Exh. B.) The reason provided was that Plaintiff was out
of the country. Plaintiff's counsel requested alternative dates, which Defense
counsel provided on October 16, 2023. (Ibid.)
 
On October
24, 2023, Defendants’ office sent another meet and confer letter, as they had
not received any responses regarding the proposed dates for Plaintiff's
deposition. (Id., ¶ 4, Exh. C.) In the letter, Defendants requested that
Plaintiff provide dates for his deposition by the end of the day on Friday,
October 27, 2023. (Ibid.) However, Plaintiff advised that he is residing
in Mexico, and claimed that he is exempt from having to attend his deposition
in person. (Ibid.)
 
Defendants’
office served another meet and confer letter on January 31, 2024. (Id., ¶ 5,
Exh. D.) Plaintiff's counsel advised that he was out of town until February 5,
2024, and stated that a response would be provided by this date. (Id., ¶ 6,
Exh. E.) On February 6, 2024, Defense counsel sent another email correspondence
to Plaintiff's counsel, since no response had been received on February 5th as
promised. (Ibid.) Plaintiff's counsel advised that he had an unexpected
family issue coming up, and that a response would be provided by February 8,
2024, "at the latest." (Ibid.) However, to this day, the
Defense has yet to receive a response to their meet and confer letter. (Ibid.)
 
CCP section
2025.310 and California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1010 (which govern remote
depositions), require any party deponent to appear at a deposition in person,
even if other parties and counsel appear remotely.
 
CCP section
2025.310 provides: 
 
(a)  
At the election of the deponent or the
deposing party, the deposition officer may attend the deposition
at a different location than the deponent via remote means. A deponent is not
required to be physically present with the deposition officer when being sworn
in at the time of the deposition. 
 
(b)  Subject
to Section 2025.420, any party or attorney of record may, but is
not required to, be physically present at the deposition at the location of the
deponent. 
 
(Emphasis
added.)
 
Thus, by its
express language, section 2025.310(a) allows the deposition officer to be in a
different location than the deponent. Subdivision (b) allows a party (who is
not a deponent) and any counsel to be in a different location than the
deponent. However, nowhere does the section grant a party-deponent the right to
be in a different location than the deposing counsel. In fact, subdivision (b)
specifically provides that the deposing attorney has the right to be
"physically present at the place of the deposition with the
deponent."
 
Furthermore,
Rule of Court 3.1010(b) provides: 
 
 
Any party, other
than the deponent, or attorney of record may appear and participate in
an oral deposition by telephone, videoconference, or other remote electronic
means, provided (1) Written notice of such appearance is served by personal
delivery, email or fax at least five court days before the deposition; (2) the
party so appearing makes all arrangements and pays all expenses incurred for
the appearance. 
 
 (Rule of Court 3.1010(b) (Emphasis added.) 
 
Plaintiff has
filed this lawsuit in the county of Los Angeles, in California, and thus has
intentionally availed himself of both Los Angeles and California as a forum.
Accordingly, the Court agrees with Defendants that he should not be allowed to
evade his discovery obligations simply because he resides abroad.
 
Plaintiff is
to appear for deposition within 20 days of entry of this order, at Defense
counsel's office located at 10960 Wilshire Blvd., 18th Floor, in Los Angeles,
California. Plaintiff failed to serve any written objection three calendar days
prior to the date of his scheduled deposition, and thereby has waived any error
or irregularity. (CCP §§ 2023.010, 2025.410(a), 2025.430, 2026.010(a).)
 
Plaintiff is
also subject to monetary sanctions. Defendants’ request for $1,110.00 in
sanctions imposed jointly and severally on counsel is granted in full. Payment
is due within 20 days of entry of this order. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendants’ motion to compel Plaintiff to appear for deposition is
granted. Plaintiff is sanctioned, jointly and severally with counsel,
$1,100.00. 
 
 
It is so ordered.
