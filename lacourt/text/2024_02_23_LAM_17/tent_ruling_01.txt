On 4/21/2022,
Plaintiff CBD Franchising, Inc. (Plaintiff or CBD) filed suit against Central
Jersey Doors & Closets, LLC, Mary Conway, William Conway, One Day Doors and
Closets, Inc., and One Day Enterprises, alleging: (1) breach of written
contract; (2) breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing; (3)
tortious interference with contractual relations; and (4) unlawful business
practices.
 
            On
1/17/2024, Plaintiff filed three motions to compel further responses from One
Day to its Requests for Admission (RFAs), Form Interrogatories (FROGs), and Requests
for Production (RFPs). 
 
For ease, the
Court has consolidated its analysis into a single ruling. 
 
Discussion 
 
I.                  
RFAs
 
Plaintiff
argues that good cause exists to compel Defendants to provide further responses
to its RFA Nos. 33-35. 
 
After review,
the Court agrees. 
 
As for RFA
Nos. 33-34, the RFAs are straightforward. RFA No. 33 asks “[a]dmit that, for
the Relevant Time Period, David Winter sent Communications to the Conway’s.” RFA
No. 34 asks, “Admit that, for the Relevant Time Period, David Winter received
Communications from the Conway’s.” 
 
Defendant
responded, after objections:
 
Subject to
these objections, Responding Party responds as follows: Responding Party admits
that, in or around August 2016, Mary Conway contacted One Day Enterprises, LLC
for information about becoming a licensed distributor for One Day Enterprises,
LLC; that, in or around October 2016, William Conway and Mary Conway traveled
to the State of California to meet with representatives of One Day Enterprises,
LLC; that, in October 2016, William Conway entered into various agreements,
including a license agreement, with One Day Enterprises, LLC; and that the
relevant agreements licensed William Conway to act as a distributor for One Day
Enterprises, LLC throughout the United States, including in California.
 
 Otherwise, denied. One Day Doors &
Closets, Inc. is not, and has never been, an active business entity. To the
extent any document (etc.) references One Day Doors & Closets, Inc. as an
active business entity, the reference was inadvertent or mistaken.
 
            Not
only are Defendants’ responses evasive, but, as noted by Plaintiff, “[t]he year
2016 is over six (6) years prior to the time period about which plaintiff
inquired. The One Day Defendants’ responses wholly fail to reference any
communications of any sort between April 1, 2022 to the present.” (Motion, 7:
17-19.)
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to its RFAs is
granted. Defendants are sanctioned, jointly and severally with counsel, $1,400.
($350/hr x 4 hr.)
 
II.              
FROGs
 
Plaintiff
argues that good cause exists to compel Defendants to supplement its FROG No.17.1
response as to RFA Nos. 33-35. 
 
As set forth
above, the Court agrees that Defendant’s responses to RFA Nos. 33-35 are
incomplete and evasive. Moreover, as noted by Plaintiff, Defendants responses
are unverified. It is well-settled that all responses must be verified. (CCP §
2030.250(a).)
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to its FROGs
is granted. Defendants are sanctioned, jointly and severally with counsel,
$1,400. ($350/hr x 4 hr.)
 
III.           
RFPs
 
Plaintiff
argues that good cause exists to compel Defendants to provide further responses
to its RFPs. 
 
After review,
the Court agrees. 
 
First,
Defendants have failed to serve any verifications in support of their
responses. (See Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632,
636 (“Unsworn responses are tantamount to no response at all.”).)
 
Second,
Defendants limited the scope of their document production to the period of
August 25, 2016 to April 7, 2017, but the relevant time frame extends to June
2018. Defendants responses are also evasive. (See e.g. responses to RFP
Nos. 44-45, 47.) 
 
Third, there
is reason to doubt Defendants’ representations that a reasonable and diligent
search has been conducted in response to CBDF’s document requests. CBDF’s
requests for production were served on October 24, 2023. (See Exs. 1-2 to
McCreary Decl.) Defendants served responses on November 28, 2023. (See Exs. 3-4
to McCreary Decl.) On December 6, 2023 Defendants’ designated corporate
representative, David Winter, testified he couldn’t recall the last time he
searched for documents responsive to CBDF’s document requests in this case,
much less than within the last 90 days since CBDF’s requests were served
(12/6/23 David Winter Depos., Ex. 9 to McCreary Decl, at 26:9-27:5, 28:12-18,
29:7-19). 
                                                                                                                               
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to its RFPs is
granted. Defendants are sanctioned, jointly and severally with counsel, $1,400.
($350/hr x 4 hr.) 
 
 
 
 
It is so ordered.
