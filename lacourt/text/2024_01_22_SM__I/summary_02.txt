```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the case and has decided to allow Pay-Up's subpoena to obtain information from JSR. The court believes that Pay-Up's need for the information outweighs any privacy rights that JSR may have. The court has found that there is a reasonable inference that JSR is a vehicle for Jona to avoid creditors, and Pay-Up has demonstrated a need for the information to support this claim. The court notes that no evidence was presented that JSR serves any other purpose. Additionally, the court has denied Pay-Up's request for sanctions, as it does not believe that sanctions will serve any purpose unless levied against counsel.
