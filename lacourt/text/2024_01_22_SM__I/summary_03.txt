And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer is partially sustained and partially overruled. The Judge finds that the defendants' argument that the plaintiff's claims are limited to medical malpractice and cannot include product liability and negligence is partially correct, but partially incorrect. The Judge rules that the defendants are not liable for product liability because they are providing a service, not selling a product. However, the Judge finds that the plaintiff's allegations that the defendants coerced the plaintiff into buying a medical device while on the gurney and that the device caused harm are sufficient to survive the demurrer. The Judge also finds that the plaintiff's allegations of fraud are sufficient to survive the demurrer, but that the plaintiff's claims of negligent supervision and intentional infliction of emotional distress are partially sustained. The Judge also criticizes the defendants' argument that the plaintiff's complaint is too long and detailed, finding that it is reasonable to add detail to the complaint to explain the theory of the case.
