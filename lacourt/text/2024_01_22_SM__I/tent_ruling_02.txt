 Case Number:  20SMCV00216    Hearing Date:   January 22, 2024    Dept:  I The court has reviewed the appropriate papers.  The court believes that its prior orders as
to the other subpoenae apply here, and therefore it incorporates those orders
by reference.  To the extent that JSR has
any privacy rights, those rights are substantially outweighed by Pay-Up’s need
for the information.  Pay-Up has
demonstrated at least a reasonable inference that JSR is at least to some
extent a vehicle by which Jona is avoiding creditors.  That court has not found that such is a fact;
merely that an inference can be made.  As
such, the subpoena is reasonable and necessary and overcomes any privacy right
JSR might (or might not) have.  The court
notes that in opposition, no one has put forth any evidence that JSR serves any
other purpose. 
Sanctions are denied. 
While the court has found in Pay-Up’s favor, the court does not believe
that sanctions will serve any purpose here unless levied against counsel.  The court is not prepared to sanction counsel
for making the arguments it made.
