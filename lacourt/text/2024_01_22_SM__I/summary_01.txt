Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court is inclined to deny the unopposed application for a continuance due to the ongoing expert discovery and the parties' inability to have FSC documents ready on time. The case was filed over four years ago, and the FSC order was given over three years ago. Despite the court's warning about the amount of work required to comply with the FSC order, the parties have only completed one deposition and have scheduled others, which will not be done until after the first full week of February. The defendant wants to file additional motions in limine, but has not specified what those motions might be. The court suggests that the parties work with all deliberate speed to prepare the FSC materials so that they can be timely filed and the case can proceed. The court will hear brief arguments from the parties and will consider any stipulations to extend the discovery cut-off for expert depositions.
