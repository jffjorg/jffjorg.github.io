 Case Number:  SC072745    Hearing Date:   January 22, 2024    Dept:  I The court is prepared to DENY the motion to tax costs so
long as plaintiff can provide the court with a conformed copy of the
judgment.  To the extent defendant is
right and a judgment was never actually entered, it is unclear that the
non-judgment can be enforced.  If the
judgment was lost, then an appropriate declaration from an appropriate official
will suffice.  But if there is no judgment
and no real proof that there ever was, then the motion would have to be
GRANTED.  Plaintiff will be given 45 days
to provide the court with a conformed copy of the judgment or an appropriate
declaration to establish that a judgment was actually entered.
The other arguments defendant makes are without merit.  It is too late in the day for defendant to
complain about an unfairness in the trial. 
Defendant could have brought a proper motion in a timely fashion, but
the court is not now going to entertain criticisms of a trial that took place
20 years ago.
