```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to tax costs will be denied if the plaintiff provides a conformed copy of the judgment. If the judgment was never entered, the court cannot enforce it, and the motion would have to be granted. The plaintiff has 45 days to provide the court with the necessary documentation or a declaration from an appropriate official. The Judge also rejects the defendant's claims of unfairness in the trial, noting that the defendant could have brought a timely motion to address these issues 20 years ago.
