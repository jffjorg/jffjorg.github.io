And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the motions to compel independent medical examination filed by the defendants in the case of Maria Angelica Amaral et al. vs Douglas James Westhoff et al. The Plaintiff filed a trip and fall lawsuit alleging various psychological conditions, including Post Concussive Syndrome, Anxiety Disorder, and others. The Defendant filed a motion to compel the Plaintiff's mental examination, which was heard by the Court on March 18, 2024.

The Judge ruled that the Defendant must specify the diagnostic tests and procedures to be used in the examination, and that the examination must be completed within six hours. The Judge also held that the Plaintiff's family history can be incorporated into the examination, but that the names of family members need not be used during the examination to protect third-party privacy.

The Judge cited Section 2032.320 and the cases of Carpenter v. Sup. Ct. and Vinson v. Superior Court in support of the ruling. The Judge noted that a mental examination is permitted only upon demonstrating good cause, and that the examination must be done in a way that safeguards the examinee's privacy against indiscriminate "fishing expeditions." The Judge ordered the parties to meet and confer and submit their respective declarations before the next hearing date.
