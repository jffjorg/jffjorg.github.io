And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to continue the trial, but only for 30 days. The new trial date is set for July __, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The judge considered the factors listed in California Rules of Court (CRC) Rule 3.1332(c) and (d), including the proximity of the trial date, whether there was a previous continuance, the length of the continuance requested, and whether all parties have stipulated to a continuance. The judge found that the defendant's conflict of interest claim was legitimate and that new counsel needed time to prepare for trial. However, the judge also considered the plaintiff's worsening health condition and the resources already devoted to trial preparation, and decided to grant a 30-day continuance rather than the full 10 months requested by the defendant.
