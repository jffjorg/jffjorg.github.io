And here is a summary of the case in English text:

The City of Beverly Hills has moved for summary judgment, arguing that a 7/8-inch uneven gap between two sidewalk concrete slabs is trivial and that they did not have notice of the purported dangerous condition. The plaintiff, Maryam Shahbazi, argues that the City's own policy deems any displacement over ¾ of an inch as non-trivial and that the City had known about the defect for several months but failed to remedy it according to its own policy.

The court finds that the size of the defect is under 1 inch, but not trivial as a matter of law. The City's own policy, which prioritizes repairs based on the severity of the defect, indicates that even a ¾-inch displacement is significant. The court also notes that the City had actual notice of the defect from an inspection report in March 2021, but failed to take corrective action or mark the defect with conspicuous color paint to warn the public.

The court concludes that the plaintiff has raised a triable issue of fact regarding the triviality of the defect and the City's notice of the dangerous condition. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment is denied.
