Significant Statements:
  - "In an action involving two or more joint tortfeasors or co-obligors, when one tortfeasor or obligor enters into a settlement with the plaintiff, the other tortfeasors or obligors are entitled to a hearing on the issue of whether the settlement was entered into in good faith."
  - "A more appropriate definition of 'good faith,' in keeping with the policies of American Motorcycle and the statute, would enable the trial court to inquire, among other things, whether the amount of the settlement is within the reasonable range of the settling tortfeasor's proportional share of comparative liability for the plaintiff's injuries."
  - "For the damages are often speculative, and the probability of legal liability therefor is often uncertain or remote."
  - "A defendant's settlement figure must not be grossly disproportionate to what a reasonable person, at the time of the settlement, would estimate the settling defendant's liability to be."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to challenge the good faith of a settlement between the plaintiff, Julie Lawlor, and defendant Francisco Rivera. The settlement was for $1,000,000, which is Rivera's insurance limit. The court found that the settlement amount is reasonable, considering the uncertainty of the total case value, which is estimated to be $5,000,000. The court also noted that Rivera's liability is shared with defendant BKM, and that the settlement is within the ballpark of an equitable settlement. The court granted Rivera's application for good faith settlement and denied the present motion.
