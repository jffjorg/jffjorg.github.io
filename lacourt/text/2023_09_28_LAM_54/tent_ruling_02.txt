BACKGROUND
                
On May 23, 2022, Plaintiff Socorro
Jacobo Sandoval sued Defendants Atlantic Solutions Group, Inc. et. al.,
alleging twenty causes of action for FEHA violations and wrongful termination.
Plaintiff alleges she was terminated because of her gender, because she needed
lactation accommodations, and because she contracted COVID-19 at the workplace.
 
The Court sustained Defendants’
demurrer to the complaint. Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint on
February 16, 2023, asserting nine causes of action for FEHA violations,
wrongful termination, whistleblower retaliation and UCL violations.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer to a complaint may be taken
to the whole complaint or to any of the causes of action in it.  (CCP § 430.50(a).)  A demurrer challenges only the legal
sufficiency of the complaint, not the truth of its factual allegations or the
plaintiff's ability to prove those allegations. 
(Picton v. Anderson Union High Sch. Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.
App. 4th 726, 732.)  The court must treat
as true the complaint's material factual allegations, but not contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law. 
(Id. at 732-33.)  The
complaint is to be construed liberally to determine whether a cause of action
has been stated.  (Id. at 733.)
 
Defendants demur to the FAC on the
grounds that it is uncertain and fails to state sufficient facts to establish
the causes of action. The Court agrees. Plaintiff has pleaded additional
factual allegations, but these facts do not establish Plaintiff’s causes of
action. 
 
Plaintiff alleges she was discriminated
against for her disability and for requesting accommodation for her disability.
It is unclear what Plaintiff claims is her disability. Plaintiff alleges she
contracted COVID-19, but alleges Defendants accommodated this by allowing
Plaintiff to work from home. Plaintiff also complains that she requested
accommodations for breastfeeding. Though breastfeeding may be an activity that
is protected by law, Plaintiff does not show that it is a “disability” under
FEHA. This is insufficient to support Plaintiff’s causes of action.
 
Defendants’ demurrer is SUSTAINED with
leave to amend. The motion to strike is MOOT.

If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the

The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received.
 
BACKGROUND
                
Plaintiff alleges she was terminated
because of her gender, because she needed lactation accommodations, and because
she contracted COVID-19 at the workplace.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“If a party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely
response to it. . .  [t]he party to whom
the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any
objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection
for work product. . . .  The party making
the demand may move for an order compelling response to the demand.”  (CCP § 2031.300(a)–(b).) When timely
responses to interrogatories are not received, “[t]he party propounding the
interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories.”  (CCP § 2030.290(b).)
If a party fails to provide a timely response to a request for admission, the
party waives any objection to the requests.  (C.C.P. § 2033.280(a).) 
Moreover, “[t]he requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of
any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction….”  (C.C.P. §
2033.280(b).) 
 
Defendants move to compel responses to
FIs – General, FIs – Employment, SIs and RPDs and to deem RFAs admitted against
Plaintiff. Defendants served the subject discovery on February 27, 2023. The
parties agreed to an extension to respond; responses were due on April 28,
2023. As of the filing of these motions, Defendants have not received
responses. Plaintiff does not oppose this motion to show responses have been
served. Defendants’ motions are GRANTED.
 
Defendants request between $5,000.00
and $2,200.00 in sanctions for each motion. As the motions are largely
duplicative, the Court will allow 6 hours of attorney time to draft the motions
and 2 hours of attorney time to attend the hearing on the motions at $650.00
per hour, for a total of $5,200.00 in sanctions against Plaintiff.
