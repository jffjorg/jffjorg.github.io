And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Socorro Jacobo Sandoval against Atlantic Solutions Group, Inc., et al. The plaintiff alleges that she was terminated due to her gender, needed lactation accommodations, and contracted COVID-19 at the workplace. The defendants demurred to the first amended complaint, and the judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend. The plaintiff is ordered to file and serve a second amended complaint within 30 days.

As for the discovery motions, the judge has granted the defendants' motions to compel responses to discovery requests and deemed certain requests for admission admitted against the plaintiff. The plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses to discovery requests without objection within 15 days. The defendants' requests for sanctions are granted in the reduced amount of $5,200.00.

The judge's decision is based on the legal sufficiency of the complaint and the failure of the plaintiff to provide timely responses to discovery requests. The judge has also concluded that the plaintiff's allegations do not establish her causes of action, including claims of discrimination and wrongful termination.
