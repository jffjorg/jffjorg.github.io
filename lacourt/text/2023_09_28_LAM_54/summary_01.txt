The Tentative Ruling states that the motions to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiffs, Eileen Carry and Sylvia Merino, are granted. The moving party, Campbell & Farahani, LLP, has sought to withdraw from representation due to broken attorney-client relationships. The court finds that there is good cause for the withdrawal, as the trial is set for November 6, 2023, and no prejudice will result from the counsel's withdrawal. The court orders that counsel shall file proofs of service of order on the plaintiffs within 5 days of notice of ruling, and counsel will be relieved upon filing of proof of service of order.
