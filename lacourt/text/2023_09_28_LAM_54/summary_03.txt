And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, Maurice A. Leiter, has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to the First Amended Complaint filed by Stockpile Property Ventures LLC against NTB Acquisitions LLC, Tamar Hamparsonian, Sako Hamparsonian, and Starcrest Escrow, Inc. The demurrer was filed by Defendant Starcrest Escrow, Inc. on the grounds that the causes of action for breach of contract, negligence, and money had and received are insufficiently pleaded.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts against Defendant Starcrest Escrow, Inc. The documents show that the NTB Defendants had actual knowledge of the demand for return of the deposit, and therefore, Defendant Starcrest Escrow, Inc. was not obligated to provide formal notice of the demand. As a result, the claims for breach of contract, negligence, and money had and received fail as pleaded.

The Defendant's demurrer is sustained with leave to amend, and the Plaintiff is ordered to file and serve a second amended complaint within 30 days of notice of ruling. The Defendant is ordered to file and serve a response within 30 days thereafter.
