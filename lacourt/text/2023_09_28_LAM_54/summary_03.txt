The Judge, Maurice A. Leiter, has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to the First Amended Complaint filed by Stockpile Property Ventures LLC against NTB Acquisitions LLC, Tamar Hamparsonian, Sako Hamparsonian, and Starcrest Escrow, Inc. The demurrer was filed by Defendant Starcrest Escrow, Inc. on the grounds that the causes of action for breach of contract, negligence, and money had and received are insufficiently pleaded.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts against Defendant Starcrest Escrow, Inc. The documents show that the NTB Defendants had actual knowledge of the demand for return of the deposit, and therefore, Defendant Starcrest Escrow, Inc. was not obligated to provide formal notice of the demand. As a result, the claims for breach of contract, negligence, and money had and received fail as pleaded.

The Defendant's demurrer is sustained with leave to amend, and the Plaintiff is ordered to file and serve a second amended complaint within 30 days of notice of ruling. The Defendant is ordered to file and serve a response within 30 days thereafter.

Although Defendant Starcrest Escrow, Inc. may have been obligated to provide formal notice, the Plaintiff did not demonstrate any damages resulting from the alleged failure to do so. The Plaintiff is given 30 days to amend the complaint to address these issues.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the demurrer filed by Defendant Starcrest Escrow, Inc. to the First Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff Stockpile Property Ventures LLC. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the complaint's factual allegations. The court has found that Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts against Defendant Starcrest. Specifically, the court has determined that the documents show that the NTB Defendants had actual knowledge of Plaintiff's demand for the return of the deposit, which makes it unnecessary for Defendant Starcrest to provide formal written notice of the demand. As a result, the court has sustained Defendant's demurrer with leave to amend. Plaintiff must file and serve a Second Amended Complaint within 30 days of notice of ruling, and Defendant must file and serve a response within 30 days thereafter.
