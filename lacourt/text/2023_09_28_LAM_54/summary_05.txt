And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Maurice A. Leiter in a case involving Alfredo Jimenez Iniguez, Martha Margarita Diaz-Morales (plaintiffs) and Samuel Abraham Jurado Miranda (defendant). The defendant has moved to compel responses to discovery requests and to deem requests for admissions (RFAs) admitted. The defendant served the discovery requests on March 20, 2023, but as of the filing of the motions, no responses have been received. The court previously continued the hearing to allow the plaintiffs to serve responses, but neither party has filed a status report stating whether responses have been served. If the plaintiffs have served responses, the motions will be denied. If the plaintiffs have not served responses or fail to inform the court of served responses, the motions will be granted and sanctions will be awarded in the amount of $1,815.00. The parties are directed to notify the court if they wish to submit on the tentative ruling.
