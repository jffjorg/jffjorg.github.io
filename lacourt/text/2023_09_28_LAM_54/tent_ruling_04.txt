Hearing Date: September 28, 2023
Department 54, Judge Maurice Leiter
(2) Motions to Set Aside Order Denying
Defendants’ Motions to Set Aside Default
Moving Party: Defendants Avfund Capital Group, Inc.
and Raul Avila
Responding Party: Plaintiff Maria Esther Flores Prieto
 
T/R:      DEFENDANTS’ MOTIONS ARE GRANTED.
DEFENDANTS’ MOTIONS TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT AND DEFAULT JUDGMENT ARE SET FOR
HEARING ON OCTOBER 18, 2023 AT 9:00AM. 
 
DEFENDANTS TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
 
The Court considers the moving papers
and opposition.
 
CCP § 473(b) provides, in pertinent
part, “[t]he court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his
or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other
proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect.” 
 
Defendants move to set aside the
Court’s August 22, 2023 order denying Defendants’ motions to set aside default
and default judgment. The Court denied the motions after Defendants failed to
appear at the hearing. Defendants’ counsel declares that he was under the
mistaken belief the motions would be heard on August 24, 2023 per a stipulation
by the parties. 
 
This is good cause to
vacate the August 22, 2023 order and restore the hearing date for the motions
to set aside default. Defendants’ motions are GRANTED.
