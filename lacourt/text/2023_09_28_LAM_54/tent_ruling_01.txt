COUNSEL TO NOTICE.
 
The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received.
 
The Court may issue an order allowing
an attorney to withdraw from representation, after notice to the client.  (CCP § 284.) 
The attorney may withdraw from representation if the withdrawal would
not result in undue prejudice to the client’s interest—that is, counsel cannot
withdraw at a critical point in the litigation. 
(Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; see
California Rule of Professional Conduct 3-700.) 
 
Campbell & Farahani, LLP, counsel
of record for Plaintiffs Eileen Carry and Sylvia Merino, seek to withdraw from
representation of Plaintiffs. Counsel state that the attorney-client
relationships have broken down. Trial is set for November 6, 2023; no prejudice
will result from counsel’s withdrawal. Counsel has complied with CRC 3.1362
 
There is good cause for counsel’s
withdrawal. The motions are GRANTED.
