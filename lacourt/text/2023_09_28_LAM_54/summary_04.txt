## English Summary

In this case, Maria Esther Flores Prieto is suing Avfund Capital Group, Inc. and Raul Avila.

The defendants had previously filed motions to set aside default and default judgment, but they missed the initial hearing on these motions. As a result, the judge denied their motions.

The defendants have now filed a motion to set aside the judge's denial, arguing that they mistakenly believed the hearing was scheduled for a different date.

In a tentative ruling, Judge Maurice Leiter has granted the defendants' motion. This means that the hearing on the defendants' motions to set aside default and default judgment will be rescheduled for October 18, 2023.

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendants, Avfund Capital Group, Inc. and Raul Avila, have moved to set aside the court's August 22, 2023 order denying their motions to set aside default and default judgment. The defendants claim that their counsel was under a mistaken belief that the motions would be heard on August 24, 2023, rather than August 22, 2023, and therefore failed to appear at the hearing. The court has considered the moving papers and opposition, and has determined that this is good cause to vacate the August 22, 2023 order and restore the hearing date for the motions to set aside default. Therefore, the defendants' motions are granted, and the motions will be set for hearing on October 18, 2023 at 9:00am.
