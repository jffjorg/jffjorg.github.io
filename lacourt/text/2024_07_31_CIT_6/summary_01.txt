And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Plaintiffs' motion for trial preference without prejudice. The Plaintiffs, who are over 70 years old and have health issues, sought trial preference under Code of Civil Procedure section 36, subdivision (a). However, the judge found that the Plaintiffs did not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that their health problems would prejudice their interests in the litigation if trial preference is not granted. Specifically, the judge noted that the Plaintiffs did not show how their alleged health conditions, such as pre-diabetes, depression, and mobility issues, would prevent them from participating in a trial beyond 120 days. The judge also declined to decide the issue of Maria Gutierrez's standing in the case. The judge ordered Defendant Covina Marketplace, LLC to give notice of the Court's ruling within five calendar days of this order.
