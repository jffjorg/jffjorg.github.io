Summary in English text:

Judge Hon. Lee S. Arian grants Cross-Defendant Bob Hart's Electric's motion to continue the trial from September 18, 2024 to March 2025, so that the motion for summary judgment can be heard. The motion for summary judgment was filed more than 105 days prior to the original trial date, and the court finds good cause to continue the trial due to the congested calendar. The parties can reopen fact discovery through stipulation or motion, and all other case-related deadlines will follow the new trial date.
