JIMENEZ vs HOLST BROTHERS, INC.

Ruling: MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL¿IS GRANTED 
 
On October 15, 2019,
Plaintiff filed the present case against Defendants, including Holst Brothers.
On December 30, 2019, Defendant Holst Brothers filed a cross-complaint against
Bob Hart’s Electric. On May 31, 2024, Cross-Defendant Bob Hart’s Electric filed
its motion for summary judgment against Defendant Holst Brothers, with the MSJ
to be heard on February 11, 2025. The current trial date is set for September
18, 2024. Cross-Defendant Bob Hart’s Electric now moves the Court to continue
the trial to sometime in March 2025 so its MSJ can be heard.
Numerous courts of appeal have held that a trial
court cannot refuse to consider a motion for summary judgment that is timely
filed. "A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment filed
within the time limits of [Code of Civil Procedure] section 437c. [Citation.]
Local rules and practices may not be applied so as to prevent the filing and
hearing of such a motion." (Sentry Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1989)
207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529); accord First State Inc. Co. v. Superior
Court (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 324, 330 [invalidating case management order to
the extent it precluded filing motions pursuant to section 437c ]; Wells
Fargo Bank v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 918, 923 [local court
rule that "require a party filing a complex summary judgment motion to
file the motion six months before the date set for trial is void and
unenforceable because it is inconsistent with section 437c"].) As the Sentry
court explained: "We are sympathetic to the problems the trial courts
experience in calendaring and hearing the many motions for summary judgment.
However, the solution to these problems cannot rest in a refusal to hear timely
motions." (Sentry, supra, at p. 530.) 
On May 31, 2024, Bob Hart filed its motion for
summary judgment with a trial date set for September 18, 2024. The MSJ was
filed more than 105 days prior to trial and is therefore timely. The court
finds good cause to continue the trial so the timely MSJ can be heard. The MSJ
cannot be advanced because the court’s calendar is congested, and as counsel
has alleged, the earliest hearing date available for the MSJ was February 11,
2025.
Plaintiff filed an opposition, stating that he
does not oppose the continuance of the trial so Bob Hart’s MSJ can be heard
prior to the trial date but requests a shorter continuance to January 17, 2025.
However, January 17, 2025, would be before the current hearing date for the
MSJ, and as the court has indicated, the MSJ cannot be advanced due to the
court’s congested calendar. 
Furthermore, this case was filed on October 15,
2019, and pursuant to Emergency Rule 10, parties have five years and six months
to bring this case to trial; a trial date in March 2025 would be within that
deadline. Thus, the court grants the present motion.
 The new
Trial Date is set for March
____, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. The Final Status Conference is continued to February ____, 2025, at
10:00 a.m. The only basis to continue the trial date is so the motion for
summary judgment can be heard. Defendant has not shown good cause to have the
fact discovery cut-off follow the new trial date. Should the parties wish to
reopen fact discovery, they can do so either through stipulation or motion.  All other case-related
deadlines, including expert discovery, will follow the new trial date.
