And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The plaintiff, Jackeline Fernandez Calles, alleges that the defendant was negligent in entrusting the train to its employee, which was involved in an accident that caused her injuries. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's causes of action for premises liability, general negligence, and motor vehicle negligence are duplicative and that the plaintiff has failed to allege a statutory basis for recovery.

The court has sustained the demurrer to the premises liability and general negligence causes of action with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff may refile the causes of action with additional allegations. The court has sustained the demurrer to the motor vehicle negligence cause of action without leave to amend, meaning that the cause of action is dismissed.

The court has also sustained the motion to strike certain allegations, including allegations of negligent entrustment, hiring, and supervision, as these are not applicable to a public entity such as the defendant. The court has overruled the request to strike certain other allegations, including allegations of negligence, carelessness, and recklessness, as these may be relevant to the defendant's liability.

The plaintiff may amend the complaint consistent with this ruling within 20 days of the date of the tentative ruling.
