And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to reclassify the case to limited civil court. The defendant filed the motion late, more than 30 days after being served with the summons and complaint, and failed to show good cause for the delay. The judge also found that there is a possibility that the plaintiff's recovery could exceed $25,000, which is the threshold for reclassification. The judge considered the plaintiff's alleged injuries, which include strain of the thoracic region, cervicalgia, lumbago, radiculopathy to the lumbar and cervical region, pain and strain to the lumbar and cervical spine, and protrusion of the lumbar disc, and determined that the plaintiff may have incurred additional medical expenses since the last medical records were produced. The judge also noted that the absence of current evidence regarding the actual cost of future treatments does not preclude the possibility that such evidence will be presented later during litigation.
