The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal. The plaintiff, Lord M. Rojas, entered into a business partnership with the defendant, Christopher Rivera, and they also shared a romantic relationship. However, the defendant allegedly did not perform on his business obligations and withheld funds from the plaintiff. The plaintiff filed a complaint alleging various causes of action, including breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and fraud. The defendant did not appear at the Order to Show Cause (OSC) hearings, and the court ultimately dismissed the case.

The plaintiff filed a motion to vacate the dismissal, citing mistake, inadvertence, and/or surprise as the reasons for his failure to appear at the OSC hearings. However, the judge found that the plaintiff failed to provide specific details about the events that prevented him from appearing in court and did not demonstrate that he proceeded diligently upon the discovery of his mistake. Additionally, the plaintiff failed to demonstrate service of the motion on the defendant. As a result, the motion is denied for both procedural and substantive reasons.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the case. The plaintiff alleged that he was entitled to discretionary relief based on mistake, inadvertence, and/or surprise due to personal circumstances, including the death of his father. However, the judge found that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient evidence to support his claims and failed to demonstrate how his personal circumstances interfered with his ability to prosecute and participate in the case. Additionally, the judge noted that the plaintiff failed to provide details surrounding the failure to appear for multiple Order to Show Cause hearings and that this omission was fatal to his claim. The judge also denied the motion because it was filed without proof of service showing that the defendant was properly notified.
