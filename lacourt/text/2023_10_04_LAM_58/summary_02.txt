And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment. The case is an unlawful detainer action, in which the Plaintiff, Hollywood Tower, LLC, seeks to evict the Defendant, Nicole Narian, for breaching the terms of the lease by failing to pay rent. The Defendant had failed to timely respond to the Complaint and a default judgment was entered on November 4, 2022. The Defendant then moved to set aside the default judgment on May 18, 2023, claiming that she had retained a law firm to handle her eviction case, but the law firm did not do any work for her. However, the Judge found that the Defendant's evidence was insufficient to demonstrate a mistake warranting relief, and that the motion was untimely and defective. The Judge also noted that the Defendant's declaration was suspiciously vague and not credible. As a result, the Judge denied the Defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment.
