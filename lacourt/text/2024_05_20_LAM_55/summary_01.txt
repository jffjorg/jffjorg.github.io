And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the motion to bifurcate the declaratory relief claim in the cross-complaint filed by Los Feliz Bliss, LLC and DFT, Inc. dba Cannon Management against Plaintiff Ariel Hirsch. The Judge has denied the motion, finding that the declaratory relief claim involves contractual rights that are also alleged in the FAC, and therefore, Plaintiff has a right to a jury trial. The Judge also found that bifurcation would result in inefficiency and would not promote judicial economy and efficiency.
