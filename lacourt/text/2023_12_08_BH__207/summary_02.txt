Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied NAI's demurrer to the Complaint and ordered NAI to file an Answer to the Complaint by December 22, 2023. The Judge found that NAI's arguments for demurrer were without merit and that the Complaint sufficiently alleged all elements of the three causes of action: negligent misrepresentation, professional negligence, and breach of contract. The Judge found that the Complaint alleged specific misrepresentations made by NAI, justifiable reliance on those misrepresentations by the Plaintiff, and damages resulting from those misrepresentations. The Judge also found that the Complaint alleged a breach of NAI's professional duty of care and a breach of contract. The Judge's tentative ruling sets the stage for further litigation and requires NAI to respond to the Complaint with an Answer.
