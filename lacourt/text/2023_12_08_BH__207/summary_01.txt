And here is a summary in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Counsel Thomas D. Sands, Esq. to be relieved as counsel for defendant Jafiel Drinkwater. Counsel has cited a "severe breakdown in the attorney-client relationship" as the reason for the motion. The court has found that the motion is substantively proper, but procedurally improper due to a lack of service on all parties who have appeared in the case. Therefore, the court denies the motion without prejudice, ordering Counsel to provide notice of the ruling and file a proof of service regarding the same.
