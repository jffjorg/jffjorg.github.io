Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
The court grants defendant Howard Management Group’s request for
judicial notice.  (Evid. Code,
§ 452, subds. (c), (d).)  The court
notes that, although it takes judicial notice of the existence of the recorded
grant deed, the court does not take judicial notice of the factual matters
stated therein.  (Herrera v. Deutsche
Bank National Trust Co. (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1375 [“‘[T]he fact
that a court may take judicial notice of a recorded deed, or similar document,
does not mean it may take judicial notice of factual matters stated
therein’”].) 
 
 
DISCUSSION
Defendant Howard Management Group (“HMG”) moves the court for an order
granting its motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the fourth, sixth,
seventh, and eighth causes of action alleged by plaintiff Sofia Nemzer
(“Plaintiff”) in her Second Amended Complaint. 
The court denies HMG’s motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the
fourth cause of action for violation of Civil Code section 54.1 because it
states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action since (1) Civil Code
section 54.3 makes liable “[a]ny person or persons, firm or corporation” who
denies a person the enjoyment of public facilities specified in section 54.1 or
otherwise interferences with the rights of an individual with a disability
thereunder, and therefore does not limit the applicability of this subdivision
to landlords only, and (2) Plaintiff has alleged facts establishing that (i)
she was denied full and equal access to the subject property as a result of the
malfunction and non-function of the elevator, and (ii) HMG contributed to the
failure to repair the elevator and therefore contributed to the denial of
access and interference with enjoyment of the property.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd.
(c)(1)(B)(ii); Civ. Code, §§ 54.1, 54.3, subd. (a); SAC ¶¶ 59, 15, 22-23.)
The court grants HMG’s motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the
sixth cause of action for violation of Civil Code section 1942.4 because it
does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action since (1) this
statute provides that “[a] landlord of a dwelling may not demand rent,
collect rent, issue a notice of rent increase, or issue a three-day notice to
pay rent or quit” in certain circumstances, but (2) Plaintiff has not alleged
that HMG is a landlord or otherwise acted as Plaintiff’s landlord and instead
has alleged that HMG “managed the Property for and on behalf of” defendant 1544
9th Street, LLC.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 438, subd. (c)(1)(B)(ii); Civ. Code, § 1942.4, subd. (a) [emphasis
added]; FAC ¶ 5.)
The court notes that, in its opposition, defendant 1544 9th Street,
LLC (“9th Street”) argues that its contract with HMG gives HMG the sole and
exclusive right to lease and maintain the premises, such that there is contractual
privity between Plaintiff and HMG. 
However, 9th Street relies on extrinsic material (specifically, the
“Property Management Agreement”) which is improper on a motion for judgment on
the pleadings.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 438, subd. (d).) 
The court denies HMG’s motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the
seventh cause of action for violation of Business and Professions Code section
17200 because it states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action since
(1) Plaintiff has alleged that she “is entitled to a monetary judgment against
Defendants equal to all of the rent and other monies paid to Defendants by
Plaintiff during the term of her tenancy[,]” which the court interprets to
request restitution, and (2) Plaintiff therefore has standing to allege this
cause of action against HMG irrespective of her allegation that she vacated the
property on February 18, 2022.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c)(1)(B)(ii); FAC ¶¶ 77, 21; Stoiber v.
Honeychuck (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903, 928 [concluding that, because the
plaintiff was not in possession of the properties, she had no need of or
standing to seek injunctive relief].)
The court denies HMG’s motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the
eighth cause of action for constructive eviction because the face of the
pleading states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action since (1)
agents of a landlord “may also be held liable on any properly pleaded tort
causes of action[;]” (2) cases have characterized constructive eviction claims
both as tort and contract in certain instances; and (3) this cause of action
does not state whether it is based in tort or on the rental agreement, and
therefore may be based in tort, such that HMG, as an agent, may be held liable
for landlord defendant 9th Street.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c)(1)(B)(ii); Stoiber, supra, 101
Cal.App.3d at pp. 929-930; Ginsberg v. Gamson (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th
873, 901 [stating that cases have acknowledged a tort claim for wrongful
constructive or actual eviction]; Hjelm v. Prometheus Real Estate Group,
Inc. (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 1155, 1169 [analyzing Civil Code section 1717 and
finding that the claim for constructive eviction arose from the lease].) 
ORDER

The court grants defendant Howard Management Group’s motion for
judgment on the pleadings as to plaintiff Sofia Nemzer’s sixth cause of action
for violation of Civil Code section 1942.4.
The court denies defendant Howard Management Group’s motion for
judgment on the pleadings as to plaintiff Sofia Nemzer’s fourth, seventh, and
eighth causes of action. 
The court grants plaintiff Sofia Nemzer 20 days leave to file a Third
Amended Complaint to cure the defects, if possible, set forth in connection
with the sixth cause of action for violation of Civil Code section 1942.4.
The court orders plaintiff Sofia Nemzer to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
