[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to
  requests for production of documents
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Kimberlina Whettam
& Associates, Inc.      
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Production of Documents
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Kimberlina Whettam & Associates, Inc. (“Plaintiff”)
moves the court for an order (1) compelling defendant Wendy Bruget
(“Defendant”) to serve responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One, and (2) awarding sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and
against Defendant in the amount of $3,392.50.
If
a party to whom a demand for inspection is directed fails to serve a timely
response, the party making the demand may move for an order compelling response
to the demand.  (Code Civ. Proc., §¿2031.300, subd. (b).) 
Plaintiff
electronically served Defendant with Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One, on December 1, 2022. 
(Ezra Decl., Ex. 1.)  Defendant
did not serve timely responses and had not served responses as of the date that
Plaintiff filed this motion.  (Ezra
Decl., ¶¶ 3, 6.)  Defendant has not
filed an opposition or other evidence with the court establishing that
responses have been served. 
The court
therefore grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s initial responses to
Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(b).) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against
Defendant.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (c).)  The court
finds that $1,540 (3 hours x $500 hourly rate + $40 filing fee) is a reasonable
amount of sanctions to impose against Defendant in connection with this
motion.  (Ezra Decl., ¶ 7.) 
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiff
Kimberlina Whettam & Associates, Inc.’s motion to compel responses to
requests for production of documents. 
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.300, the court orders defendant Wendy Bruget (1) to serve on
plaintiff Kimberlina Whettam & Associates, Inc. full and complete verified
responses, without objections, to Kimberlina Whettam & Associates, Inc.’s
Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, that comply with Code of Civil
Procedure sections 2031.210 through 2031.250, and (2) to produce to plaintiff
Kimberlina Whettam & Associates, Inc. all documents and things in defendant
Wendy Bruget’s possession, custody, or control which are responsive to those
requests, within 20 days of the date of service of this order. 
            The court grants plaintiff Kimberlina
Whettam & Associates, Inc.’s request for monetary sanctions.  The court orders defendant Wendy Bruget to
pay sanctions to plaintiff Kimberlina Whettam & Associates, Inc. in the
amount of $1,540 within 30 days of the date of service of this order. 
 
The court orders plaintiff Kimberlina Whettam & Associates, Inc.
to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  October 25, 2023
