And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike in a case involving fraud and deceit, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract claims. The court has overruled defendants' demurrer to the first cause of action for fraud and deceit and the second cause of action for negligent misrepresentation, finding that the allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action. The court has sustained defendants' demurrer to plaintiff Du and Bai's third cause of action for breach of contract, finding that the allegations do not state a cause of action against the defendants. The court has also granted defendants' motion to strike plaintiffs' prayer for attorney's fees, finding that the prayer is not supported by the pleadings. The court has denied all other relief requested in the motion to strike. The court has granted plaintiffs 20 days to file a second amended complaint that cures the defects in the original complaint.
