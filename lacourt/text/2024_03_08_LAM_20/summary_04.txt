And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the Motion to Quash filed by Defendant/Cross-Complainant Anastasiia Arseneva. The motion was filed in response to a subpoena served by Defendant/Cross-Defendant Omar Zambrano, which requested Arseneva's phone records from AT & T Wireless. The judge found that the subpoena was defective because it lacked the consumer's consent, as required by CCP § 1985.3(f). The judge also found that the subpoena was overly broad and that Arseneva's privacy interests outweighed the potential benefits of the discovery. The judge noted that Zambrano could have requested an order from the court compelling Arseneva's consent if she refused to provide it. The judge ordered Arseneva to give notice of the ruling.
