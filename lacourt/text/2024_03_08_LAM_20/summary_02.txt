And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiffs, David and Connie Reed. The defendants had previously sought to schedule depositions for October 4 and 9, 2023, but the plaintiffs failed to appear. The plaintiffs claimed that they had a medical condition that prevented Connie from testifying, but this was only mentioned for the first time in an email to the defendants on November 11, 2023, and was not communicated earlier in the case. The judge found that the plaintiffs failed to prioritize their discovery obligations and did not provide a valid reason for their non-appearances. The judge also noted that the defendants had made reasonable efforts to accommodate the plaintiffs' schedules and that the non-appearances were not the fault of the defendants. As a result, the judge awarded sanctions to the defendants in the amount of $1,400 and granted the motion to compel the deposition.
