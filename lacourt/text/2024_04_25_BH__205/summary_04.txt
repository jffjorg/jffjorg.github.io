And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling grants Defendant Thomas Latimer's motion to quash service of summons in an unlawful detainer action. The Plaintiff, Janet Farzan, filed a proof of service on Judicial Council form POS-040, which is not intended for use in showing service of a summons and complaint. The Court finds that the use of the improper form and the Plaintiff's failure to file an opposition to the motion to quash justify granting the motion. The Court concludes that the service of summons and complaint is invalid and grants the motion to quash.
