**Judge's Analysis:**

* Landlord did not properly comply with all the substantive and procedural requirements for a default judgment.
* Landlord failed to specify the basis for the requested 10% interest.

**Judge's Order:**

* Denies Landlord's Request for Default Judgment without prejudice.


**English Summary:**

The Judge is denying the Landlord's request for a default judgment against the Tenant because the Landlord did not follow all the necessary procedures. 

Specifically, the Landlord did not provide enough information about the interest they are seeking and did not include the lease agreement to support their claim for attorney's fees. Despite this, the Judge is not completely dismissing the case. The Landlord can refile their request for a default judgment once they have addressed these issues.
