## English Summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion by Plaintiff Margaret Medina to compel the City of Culver City to produce an incident report related to a trip and fall incident. The Plaintiff tripped and fell on uneven bricks while being transported by a City employee, Spencer Wray.  

The City claims the incident report is protected by attorney-client privilege because it was prepared at the direction of the City Attorney, after the Plaintiff filed a claim, and was only shared with legal representatives. The Judge agrees with the City, citing case precedent that establishes the dominant purpose of incident reports in similar situations is for potential legal defense.  

The Judge denies the Plaintiff's motion to compel the production of the report and also denies her request for monetary sanctions against the City, finding the City had a strong legal basis for its claim of privilege.
