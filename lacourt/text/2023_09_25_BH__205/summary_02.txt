And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to a request for production of documents. The case involves a trip and fall accident caused by uneven parkway and jagged bricks, where the Plaintiff, Margaret Medina, was being transported in a van driven by Defendant Spencer Wray, an employee of Defendant City of Culver City. The City refused to produce an incident report prepared by Wray after the accident, citing attorney-client privilege. The Judge agrees with the City that the report is privileged because it was prepared at the direction of the City Attorney and was intended for transmission to counsel. The Judge denied the Plaintiff's motion to compel production of the report and also denied the Plaintiff's request for sanctions. The ruling is based on case law, including Heffron v. Los Angeles Transit Lines, Soltani-Rustegar v. Superior Court, Scripps Health v. Superior Court, and Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Superior Court.
