**English Summary:**

Judge Moreton is inclined to grant Houck Construction Inc.'s request for a default judgment against Jennifer Berglas.  

This case stems from a contract for home renovations where Berglas failed to pay Houck Construction for the work completed. Houck Construction recorded a mechanic's lien and filed a lawsuit. Berglas was served but did not respond, leading to a default judgment by the clerk. 

Houck Construction is now seeking a default judgment for the full amount owed, including damages, interest, attorney's fees, and costs. The court finds that Houck Construction has followed all the necessary procedures and has provided sufficient evidence to support the requested judgment. Since Berglas has not participated in the case, the judge is likely to rule in favor of Houck Construction.
