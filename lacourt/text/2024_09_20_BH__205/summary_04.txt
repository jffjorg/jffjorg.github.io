Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to vacate the dismissal of the case brought by Tia Brooks, Maura Brooks, and Michael Jacobs-Sierra against Matthew Moore. The case arises from a car accident that occurred on August 11, 2021, and the plaintiffs are seeking to set aside the dismissal that was entered on August 9, 2024. The Judge finds that the mandatory relief provision of Code of Civil Procedure (Civ. Proc.) §473(b) applies, as the dismissal was not due to any of the items listed above, such as failure to prosecute or failure to serve a complaint within three years. The Judge grants the motion to vacate the dismissal and reinstates the action, setting an Order to Show Cause re default judgment for October 24, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.
