And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to set aside a dismissal of a complaint. The plaintiff, Diana Lyte, purchased a 2019 Volkswagen Tiguan with defects and nonconformities, and the defendant, Volkswagen Group of America, Inc., failed to repair the vehicle within a reasonable number of attempts. The plaintiff's counsel failed to file a case management statement and attend a scheduled conference, resulting in the dismissal of the complaint. The plaintiff seeks to set aside the dismissal, arguing that counsel's mistake was excusable. However, the Court concludes that counsel's mistake was not excusable, as counsel was aware of the scheduled conference and failed to attend, and the dismissal was not due to a default. Therefore, the Court denies the motion to set aside the dismissal.
