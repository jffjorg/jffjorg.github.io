And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the action. The plaintiff, Vahe Khachikyan, was involved in a car accident on October 28, 2022, and filed a lawsuit against the defendant, Melvin Leonard Schecter, alleging motor vehicle and general negligence. The case was dismissed on July 31, 2024, due to the plaintiff's failure to appear at a case management conference and order to show cause hearing. The plaintiff argued that the failure to appear was due to an administrative error by his counsel, who had hired a new team and inadvertently caused calendaring errors. The judge found that the mandatory relief provision of California Code of Civil Procedure ยง473(b) was applicable and granted the motion to set aside the dismissal. The judge noted that the attorney's affidavit of fault and the lack of prejudice to the defendant supported the granting of the motion. The case is reinstated, and a new case management conference is scheduled for October 24, 2024.
