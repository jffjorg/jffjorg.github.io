Legal
Standard
  
Personal service of a deposition subpoena obligates the
production of whatever documents or things are specified in the subpoena and to
appear in any proceedings to enforce discovery. (CCP § 2020.220(c).) If a
nonparty disobeys a deposition subpoena, the subpoenaing party may seek a court
order pursuant to CCP section 1987.1 compelling the nonparty to comply with the
subpoena within 60 days after completion of the deposition record. (CCP §
2025.480(b); see also UnzippedApparel, LLC v. Bader (2007) 156
Cal.App.4th 123, 127.) The motion must be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration. (CCP § 2025.480(b).)
 
A motion to compel production of documents described in a
deposition notice must be accompanied by a showing of good cause. (CCP §
2025.450(b)(1).) In other words, the moving party must provide declarations
containing specific facts justifying inspection of the documents described in
the notice.  
 
The motion to compel must be “made no later than 60 days
after the completion of the record of the deposition.” (CCP § 2025.480(b).)
This time limit also applies to motions based on a deposition subpoena for
production of documents or a business records subpoena. The 60-day time limit
runs from the date objections are served because the deposition record is then
complete. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,
1192.) 
 
Analysis
 

Plaintiff Dorothy Sosnicki moves to
compel third-party BMO Bank, N.A. (“BMO”) to comply with the subject Deposition
Subpoena for Production of Business Records.  BMO does not oppose.
 
On April 5, 2024, Plaintiff served
the Subpoena on BMO with a requested production date of May 8, 2024. (Matthews
Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. 1.) Despite Plaintiff’s good faith attempt to meet and confer, BMO
failed to produce a single document. (¶¶ 4, 6.) Plaintiff shows good cause for
production. This action regards enforcement of a sister-state judgment. BMO possesses
records relating to the deposit accounts of judgment debtor S&F Management
Company, LLC. (¶ 4.) Plaintiff needs documents related to the assets of S&F
Management Company to enforce the judgment.
 
Plaintiff demonstrates that they
incurred $2,287.50 of reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees in making this motion.
Plaintiff explains that this encompasses 2.5 hours preparing the moving papers
and an anticipated 2 hours preparing a Reply and appearing at the hearing on
the motion, with a filing fee of $60.00. BMO did not oppose the motion, and
thus, there was no reply. Accordingly, the court will award sanctions in the
reduced total amount of $1,792.50, inclusive of costs.
 
            Accordingly,
the motion to compel is GRANTED. BMO must comply with the subpoena within 10
days. Sanctions are imposed against BMO in the amount of $1,792.50. Sanctions
are to be paid to counsel within 30 days.
