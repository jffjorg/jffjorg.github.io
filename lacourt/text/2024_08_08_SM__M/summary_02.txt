And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendants' motions for summary judgment, finding that they have not met their burden of proof to show that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The defendants had argued that the plaintiff had no evidence to support her alter ego and/or aiding and abetting theories of liability against them. However, the judge found that the plaintiff's responses to the defendants' special interrogatories and requests for production of documents provided sufficient evidence to raise triable issues of fact. The judge also denied the defendants' motion to seal opposition and reply papers, finding that they had not met their burden to show that the sealing was necessary to protect an overriding interest.
