[1] Defendants
set forth sufficient evidence to meet their prima facie burden as to the alter
ego allegations. While not making any findings, the Court determines that Plaintiff
failed to meet her responsive burden to show any dispute of material fact
concerning any alter ego factors, or that an inequity would result. For example,
Plaintiff contends that Defendants co-mingled funds. (UMF 22.) However, Plaintiff
only cites the contractual assignment of liabilities and management fees. There
is no evidence of actual commingling, but only contractual obligations of
payment and risk assignment. The assignment of risks and profits does not, by
itself, suggest that the Defendants have comingled funds.Â
