And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a motion by counsel Fisher, Klein & Wolfe LLP to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Advanced Pain Solutions Inc. The counsel has submitted all mandatory forms and states that an irreparable breakdown in communication with the client has occurred. Despite efforts to confirm the client's address, the counsel was unable to do so. The judge finds that the client will not be prejudiced by the withdrawal, as trial is not set. The motion is granted.
