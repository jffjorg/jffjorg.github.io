And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the evidence presented in the case and has determined that the defendants have met their initial burden to prove that they are not an alter ego of the plaintiff. The plaintiff has failed to provide sufficient evidence to dispute this claim or show that an inequity would result. Specifically, the plaintiff has only pointed to contractual obligations of payment and risk assignment, but there is no evidence of actual commingling of funds. The judge has not made any findings yet, but has determined that the plaintiff has not met their burden to show a dispute of material fact concerning the alter ego factors.
