Background
            Plaintiffs
leased residential premises owned and or managed by Defendants Alina Sanchez,
individually and as Trustee of the Dominguez Family Trust, and EAJS, LLC.  Plaintiffs allege the premises suffered from
multiple conditions that rendered the property uninhabitable, including a
cockaroach and bedbug infestation.  
 
Legal
Standard
Court approval
is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim. (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600,
et seq.; CCP § 372.) “[W]ithout trial court approval of the proposed compromise
of the ward’s claim, the settlement cannot be valid. Nor is the settlement
binding [on the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.” (Pearson v.
Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.) A minor, “shall appear
either by a guardian or conservator of the estate or by guardian ad litem
appointed by the court in which the action or proceeding is pending, or by a
judge thereof, in each case.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 372, subd. (a)(1).)
Alternatively, the petitioner may file a declaration demonstrating that he or
she has a right to compromise the minor’s claim under Cal. Probate Code Section
3500. 
            Regarding
the substance of the Petition, to obtain court approval of the settlement of a
minor’s claims, the petitioner must file a complete and “verified petition for
approval of the settlement and must disclose ‘all information that has any
bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise.’” (Barnes v. Western
Heritage Ins. Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256); (CRC 7.950.)
A petition for
court approval of a compromise or covenant not to sue under Code of Civil
Procedure section 372 must comply with California Rules of Court, rules 7.950,
7.951 and 7.952. The petition must be verified by the petitioner and contain a
full disclosure of all information that has “any bearing upon the
reasonableness” of the compromise, covenant, settlement, or disposition.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)  The person compromising the claim on behalf
of the minor or person who lacks capacity, and the represented person, must
attend the hearing on compromise of the claim unless the court for good cause
dispenses with their personal appearance. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
7.952.)  An order for deposit of funds of
a minor or person lacking decision making capacity and a petition for the
withdrawal of such funds must comply with California Rules of Court, rules
7.953 and 7.954. (Cal. Rules of Court 3.1384; see also Super. Ct. L.A. County,
Local Rules, rules 4.115-4.118.)
 
Discussion
            Petitioner
Walter Giron submits the required Mandatory Judicial Counsel Forms MC-350
(Petition), MC-251 (Order Approving Minor’s Compromise) and MC-355 (Order to
Deposit Funds into Blocked Account) on behalf of Claimants Emilson Giron, Abigail
Giron and Mayrin Giron, Walter’s minor children.  Each of set of forms is fully and correctly completed
on behalf of each Claimant.  Each
Claimant received the same settlement with Defendant Alina Sanchez,
individually and as Trustee of the Dominguez Family Trust.  
            Defendant
Alina Sanchez, individually and as Trustee of the Dominguez Family Trust, will
pay $5000 in settlement of each of Emilson Giron’s, Abigail Giron’s and Mayrin
Giron’s claims.  (Petition, Item 10b.)  None of the claimants have received any medical
treatment or paid medical expenses.  (Petition,
Item 12a.)
The total amount
of attorney’s fees to be deducted from each Claimant’s settlement fund is
$1,250, 25% of the settlement funds.  (Petition,
Item 13a.)  Counsel provides a
declaration in support of the fees to be deducted and a copy of the retainer
agreement.  (Petition, Attachments 13a, 17a.)  
            The
net balance of the settlement proceeds going to each Claimant is $3,750.  (Petition, Item 15.)  The proceeds will be deposited in an insured
account subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the court.  (Petition, Item 18b.)  The name, branch and address of the
depository for the funds is identified as Chase Bank, Larchmont Village Branch.  (Petition, Attachment 18b(2).)  
Petitioner’s
Petitions to Approve Minor’s Compromise on behalf of Claimants Emilson Giron,
Abigail Giron and Mayrin Giron are GRANTED. 
 
 
            It
is so ordered.
