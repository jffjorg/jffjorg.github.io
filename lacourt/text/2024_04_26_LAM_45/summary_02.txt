Summary: The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, finding that the defendant failed to provide proof of insurance and remains in possession of the premises despite the expiration of the notice period to cure the breach. The defendant's failure to provide proof of insurance and to cure the breach within the notice period constitutes an unlawful detainer under CCP §1161(3). The judge also denies the defendant's motions to compel further responses to interrogatories and requests for production, as they are moot in light of the grant of summary judgment.
