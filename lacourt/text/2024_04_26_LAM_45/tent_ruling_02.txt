 Case Number:  23STCV09467    Hearing Date:   April 26, 2024    Dept:  45 Superior Court of  California County  of Los Angeles        DAVID    H. KIM,                                Plaintiff,                                 vs. DZLA,    LLC, ET AL.                                 Defendants.   Case No.:  23STCV09467 DEPARTMENT    45       [TENTATIVE] RULING       Action    Filed:  April 28, 2023 [1st    Amended Complaint Filed:  May 23, 2023] Trial    Date:  June 24, 2024      Hearing  date:              April  26, 2024 Moving  Party:             Plaintiff  David H. Kim  Responding  Party:      None  as of April 23, 2024  Motion  for Summary Judgment/Adjudication       The Court  considered the moving papers.  There was  no opposition filed.  Plaintiff filed an  unauthorized supplemental brief in support of the Motion for Summary  Judgment/Adjudication.  The Court does  not consider Plaintiff’s unauthorized supplement brief, which contains new  evidence.               Plaintiff’s  Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. Background             Plaintiff  leased commercial property to Defendant DZLA, LLC.  Plaintiff served Defendant with three 10-day Notices  to Cure or Quit pursuant to CCP §1161(3) and on 30-day Notice to Cure or Quit for  violations under Lease §13.1(d) and (e).   Plaintiff served three of the notices on March 17, 2023 in accordance  with CCP §1162, posting them at the property and mailing them to Defendant’s  address for service in the Lease Agreement.   Plaintiff served the fourth notice on April 26, 2023, personally serving  the occupants at the premises and mailing the notice the Defendants.  Defendant did not cure the defaults set forth  in the four notices within the time to cure.                On  April 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant action for unlawful detainer.  On May 23, 2023, Plaintiff filed the  operative First Amended Complaint alleging unlawful detainer pursuant to CCP  §1161(3).   Legal  Standard “A plaintiff or  cross-complainant has met his or her burden of showing that there is no defense  to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the cause of  action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action. Once the  plaintiff or cross-complainant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the  defendant or cross-defendant to show that a triable issue of one or more  material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (CCP  §437c(p)(1).)    “A party is  entitled to summary judgment only if it meets its initial burden of showing  there are no triable issues of fact and the moving party is entitled to  judgment as a matter of law. This is true even if the opposing party fails to  file any opposition.  The court's  assessment of whether the moving party has carried its burden—and therefore  caused a shift—occurs before the court's evaluation of the opposing party's  papers.  Therefore, the burden on the  motion does not initially shift as a result of what is, or is not, contained in  the opposing papers.”  (Mosley v.  Pacific Specialty Insurance Company (2020) 49 Cal.App.5th 417, 434–435  (landlord’s failure to address issue of whether they were aware of their  tenant’s marijuana growing operation was not grounds to grant summary judgment  where moving party failed to satisfy its initial burden as to the issue); Thatcher  v. Lucky Stores, Inc. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1081, 1086-1087 (court cannot  grant summary judgment based merely on lack of opposition; court must first  determine if the moving party has satisfied its burden).) In addition, the  evidence and affidavits of the moving party are construed strictly, while those  of the opponent are liberally read.  (Government  Employees Ins. Co. v. Sup. Ct. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 95, 100.)  “All doubts as to the propriety of granting  the motion (whether there is any issue of material fact [Code of Civil  Procedure] § 437c) are to be resolved in favor of the party opposing the motion  (i.e., a denial of summary judgment).”  (Hamburg  v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 497, 502.)   Discussion             Plaintiff  moves for summary judgment based on one of the four Notices to Cure or Quit  upon which he bases his First Amended Complaint for Unlawful Detainer.  Plaintiff served Defendant with four separate  notices detailing four separate breaches of the Lease Agreement under CCP  §1161(3).  Three of the Notices to Cure  or Quit set forth breaches of the §§6.3, 7.3(b) and 13.1(d) of the Lease  Agreement requiring that Defendant (1) comply with all applicable building  codes, laws, CC&Rs, regulation, and ordinances and (2) refrain from making  any alterations or utility installations to the premises without Plaintiff’s  consent.  (FAC, Exs. 2, 3 and 5.)  One of the Notices to Cure or Quit sets forth  breach of §8.5 of the Lease Agreement, which required Defendant to provide  Plaintiff with copies of required of endorsements evidencing the existence and  amounts of insurance mandated under §8.5 of the Lease Agreement.  (FAC, Ex. 4.)   Plaintiff moves for summary judgment based solely on the 10-day Notice  to Cure or Quit based on Defendant’s failure to provide proof of insurance  prior to the Start Date under the Lease Agreement.  (FAC, Ex. 4.)             Plaintiff  satisfies its burden as moving party             “A  tenant of real property, for a term less than life, or the executor or  administrator of the tenant's estate heretofore qualified and now acting or  hereafter to be qualified and act, is guilty of unlawful detainer:…3.  When the tenant continues in possession, in  person or by subtenant, after a neglect or failure to perform other conditions  or covenants of the lease or agreement under which the property is held,  including any covenant not to assign or sublet, than the one for the payment of  rent, and three days' notice, excluding Saturdays and Sundays and other  judicial holidays, in writing, requiring the performance of those conditions or  covenants, or the possession of the property, shall have been served upon the  tenant, and if there is a subtenant in actual occupation of the premises, also,  upon the subtenant.”  (CCP  §1161(3).)               Plaintiff  establishes that Defendant and Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement that  required Defendant to provide certain insurance documents to Plaintiff:  “Lessee shall, prior to the Start Date,  deliver to Lessor certified copies of policies of such insurance or  certificates with copies of the required endorsements evidencing the existence and  amounts of the required insurance.”  (Kim  Dec. ISO Motion for Summary Judgment, Ex. G, Lease Agreement, p. 6, §8.5.)               Plaintiff  submits evidence that Defendant took possession of the premises on March 1,  2022, the Start Date under the Lease Agreement.   (Kim Dec., ¶11, Ex. G, Lease Agreement, ¶¶1 and 2.2.)  Plaintiff submits evidence that Defendant  failed to provide certified copies of the required insurance policies or  certificates with copies of the required endorsements prior to the Start Date  or after expiration of the 10-day Notice to Cure or Quit.  (Id. at ¶¶11, 12.)   The Notice to  Cure or Quit was served personally on Defendant’s “owner” on April 26, 2023  with 10-days notice to cure, as required under §13.1(d) of the Lease Agreement.  (Kim Dec., ¶20.)  Defendant was required to submit proof that  it was maintaining the following types of insurance:  liability insurance carried by tenant,  property damage insurance, business interruption insurance, and worker’s compensation  insurance.  (Kim Dec., ¶12.)  Plaintiff establishes that Defendant had  until May 10, 2023 to respond to the Notice of Default and provide the  requisite proof of insurance under §8.5 of the Lease Agreement.  (Id.) Plaintiff  submits evidence that he has never received the required proof of insurance.  Plaintiff submits evidence that he has never  received a Certificate and Endorsement that show that DZLA, LLC was covered for  General Liability Insurance.  (Kim Dec.,  ¶12.)  Plaintiff submits evidence that he  has only received (1) a Certificate of Liability Insurance dated May 3, 2023 but  no Endorsement; (2) a General Liability Endorsement with the named insured  being David Zwirner, Inc., who is not Defendant; and (3) a Certificate of  Liability Insurance identical to the one dated May 3, 2023 but with the new  date of August 29, 2023.  (Kim Dec., Exs.  H and I.)   Plaintiff  submits evidence that, on October 11, 2023, Defendant submitted a Certificate  of Commercial General Liability Insurance and an Endorsement listing Defendant  as an insured.  (Kim Dec., ¶19, Ex.  J.)  However, there were no certificates  of insurance and endorsements establishing the existence of any of the other  required types of insurance—Worker’s Compensation, Property Damage and Business  Interruption.  (Kim Dec., ¶19.)  The Certificate of Commercial General  Liability Insurance and Endorsement were also submitted after expiration of the  10-day Notice period to cure quit.  (Id.)  Despite failing to cure Defendant’s breach of  §8.5, Defendant remains in possession of the premises (Id. at ¶25.) Based on this  evidence, Plaintiff establishes (1) the existence of a lease agreement with  Defendant; (2) Defendant’s obligation under §§8.2 and 8.4 of the lease  agreement to maintain commercial general liability insurance, property damage  insurance, business interruption insurance and worker’s compensation insurance;  (3) Defendant’s obligation under §8.5 of the Lease to provide Plaintiff with  copies of the policies or Certificates of Insurance with Endorsements as to  each type of required insurance “prior to the Start Date [March 1, 2022]; (4)  Defendant failed to comply with §8.5 of the Lease when it did not provide the  requisite proofs of insurance; (5) Plaintiff served Defendant with a 10-day Notice  to Cure or Quit Defendant’s breach of §8.5 on April 26, 2023; (6) Defendant did  not cure the breach by May 10, 2023, the date on which the 10-day period  expired; (7) Defendant has still not fully complied with its obligations under  §8.5; and (8) Defendant remains in possession of the premises.     Plaintiff’s  evidence establishes Defendant’s unlawful detainer of the rental premises  pursuant to CCP §1161(3).  Plaintiff  satisfies its burden as moving party.   The burden therefore shifts to Defendant to raise a triable issue of  material fact with admissible evidence. Defendant fails  to raise a triable issue of material fact Pursuant to CRC  Rule 3.1351(b), any opposition or reply made be made orally at the  hearing.  Pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1351(c),  if a party seeks to have a written opposition considered in advance of the  hearing, the written opposition must be filed and served on or before the court  day before the hearing.   As of April 24,  2024 at 9:00 a.m, Defendant has not filed any opposition to the motion for  summary judgment.  As such, Defendant  failed to raise a triable issue of material fact.  Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment is  therefore granted.   Plaintiff’s  Supplemental Brief and Evidence Plaintiff filed  a “Supplemental Brief in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment/Adjudication”  and a “Supplemental Declaration of Sandy Kim in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion  for Summary Judgment/Adjudication.”   Pursuant to CCP §437c, Plaintiff was not entitled to file such  supplemental briefing and evidence.   Plaintiff was only entitled to file a “Reply” to any opposition.  (CCP §437c(b)(4).)  New evidence is generally not allowed on  reply.  (San Diego Watercrafts, Inc.  v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 308, 316.)  However, a court has discretion to consider  new evidence in reply papers in ruling on a summary judgment motion, provided  the other party had notice and an opportunity to respond.  (Plenger v. Alza Corp. (1992) 11 CA4th  349, 362, 13 CR2d 811, 819, fn. 8; Jacobs v. Coldwell Banker Residential  Brokerage Co. (2017) 14 CA5th 438, 449-450.) Plaintiff  indicates in the supplemental brief that it is based on facts discovered after  the motion for summary judgment was filed.   Plaintiff maintains Defendant’s breach of its obligation to maintain  Worker’s Compensation insurance and to provide proof thereof under §§8.4 and  8.5 of the Lease is definitely established by new evidence that Defendant did  not obtain Worker’s Compensation Insurance Waiver of Subrogation Endorsement  until January 26, 2024, almost a full year after expiration of the 10-day period  to cure the breach on May 10, 2023.   Plaintiff’s  supplemental brief and evidence raises an entirely new issue that was not  presented in the original motion.  As  such, the Court will not consider the Supplemental Brief or the Supplemental  Declaration by Kim.   Conclusion             Plaintiff’s  Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.                 It  is so ordered.   Dated:   April 26, 2024   _______________________ Rolf M.
