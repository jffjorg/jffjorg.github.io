And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the papers filed by both parties and has denied Defendant Jian Jun Lu's Ex Parte Application to Continue Trial. The application was based on the fact that Defendant Lu has filed a motion for leave to file a cross-complaint, which is currently scheduled to be heard seven days after the jury trial. However, the judge does not consider the merits of the underlying motion and notes that the mere filing of a motion for leave to file a cross-complaint does not warrant good cause to continue the trial. As a result, the application is denied, but the denial is without prejudice. The moving party is to give notice.
