And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motions to compel responses to interrogatories and production demands, as well as a motion to deem admitted the genuineness of documents and truth of all matters specified in a request for admissions. The plaintiff, the landlord, filed these motions against the defendant, the tenant, due to the defendant's failure to respond to discovery requests. The defendant sought $1,860.00 in sanctions for each motion, but the court found no opposition to the motions and no evidence that the defendant had responded to the discovery at issue. As a result, the court granted the plaintiff's motions to compel, ordering the defendant to provide responses to the discovery requests without objections within 30 days of the notice of ruling. The court also granted the plaintiff's motion to deem admitted the genuineness of documents and truth of all matters specified in the request for admissions. In addition, the court awarded the plaintiff $900.00 in sanctions for the reasonable costs and fees associated with bringing the motions, which are payable to the plaintiff's counsel by the defendant and due within 30 days of the notice of ruling.
