 Case Number:  23AHCV00290    Hearing Date:   October 1, 2024    Dept:  X Defendant Jian Jun Lu’s Ex Parte Application to
Continue Trial
 
The Court has considered the moving and
opposing papers of the parties.  Defendant
Lu’s Ex Parte Application to Continue Trial is denied without prejudice.  The basis of the application is that
Defendant Lu has filed a motion for leave to file a cross-complaint, the latter
of which is currently scheduled to be heard seven days after the jury trial in
this matter.  No request to advance the
hearing date of Defendant's motion has been made. 
As such, the Court does not consider the merits of the underlying motion
for purposes of this application, i.e., whether the motion for leave will be granted
or denied.  The mere filing of a motion
for leave to file a cross-complaint does not warrant good cause to continue
trial.  Defendant Lu’s application is,
therefore, denied. 
 
Moving party is to give notice.
