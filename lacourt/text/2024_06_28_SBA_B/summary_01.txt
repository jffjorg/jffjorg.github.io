Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Levita Butts v. Bernard Heath, a dispute over retaliatory eviction. The plaintiff, Levita Butts, filed a complaint against the defendant, Bernard Heath, alleging that he wrongfully interfered with her quiet use and enjoyment of the property and is attempting to evict her in retaliation for her complaints about the property's habitability. The defendant demurred to the complaint, arguing that the plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to state a cause of action.

The judge ruled that the demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave to amend as to the first cause of action for retaliatory eviction. The judge found that the allegations are insufficient to constitute a cause of action for retaliatory eviction because the defendant's alleged conduct was not within 180 days of the plaintiff's complaint about the plumbing problems. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's allegations are insufficient that the defendant is not acting in good faith by claiming he has a relative who needs the apartment.

The judge admonished the plaintiff's counsel for failing to appear at the May 6, 2024 Case Management Conference and for failing to file a Case Management Conference Statement. The judge also noted that the complaint fails to include the plaintiff's attorney's State Bar Number, as required by Rule of Court 2.111. The judge ordered the defendant to give notice of the ruling.
