And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer filed by the defendant, County of Los Angeles, without leave to amend. The plaintiff, ZULA TUCKER LIVING TRUST, Fred Tucker, trustee, had filed a complaint alleging breach of contract by the County. The County argued that the plaintiff failed to exhaust the administrative remedy under the Revenue and Taxation Code and that the complaint is untimely under section 5141. The Judge agrees with the County's arguments, finding that the allegations are insufficient to state a cause of action for breach of contract. The Judge also finds that the complaint is time-barred under section 5141, as the plaintiff's application for a refund was denied on January 20, 2022, and the complaint was filed on January 9, 2023, more than six months later.
