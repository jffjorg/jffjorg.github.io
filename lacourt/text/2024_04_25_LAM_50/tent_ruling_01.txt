[TENTATIVE
AND PROPOSED] STATEMENT OF DECISION BY
THE COURT AFTER TRIAL      
This
matter came on for trial on February 14-15, 2024, in Department 50 of the
above-entitled Court before the Hon. Teresa A. Beaudet, sitting without a jury.
The Court, having considered the evidence and read the arguments of counsel,
issues this tentative and proposed Statement of Decision. This tentative and
proposed Statement of Decision will become the Statement of Decision unless,
within 15 days hereafter, a party serves and files objections to the proposed
Statement of Decision. 
 
 
I.               
STIPULATED FACTS 
On
June 6, 2022, the parties filed a Joint List of Stipulated Facts for Trial.
Pursuant thereto, 
the
parties agreed to the following:
1.    
Plaintiff Warren Breslow, as Trustee of
The Survivor’s Trust Under the Warren L. Breslow Trust (“Breslow”) and Defendant
IC Funding, Inc. (“IC”) entered into a promissory note dated March 12, 2018
(the “Note”) wherein Breslow agreed to loan $250,000 (the “Principal Balance”)
to IC. (TE1)[1]
2.    
IC received the Principal Balance.
3.    
Defendant Carmiel Cohen (“Cohen”) executed
the Note as President of IC and, at that time, believed he was President of IC.
Cohen later learned that he never was the President of IC.
4.    
At the time Cohen executed the Note, he
believed that he had authority to execute the Note on behalf of IC.
5.    
Cohen read and understood the terms of the
Note when he executed the Note.
6.    
Breslow read and understood the terms of
the Note when he executed the Note.
7.    
Cohen entered into a Guaranty dated March
12, 2018 (the “Guaranty”). (TE2)
8.    
Cohen read and understood the terms of the
Guaranty when he executed the Guaranty.
9.    
Breslow has performed all of the
conditions, covenants and promises required to be performed in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Note. 
10.  The
Note states that it is a fully integrated agreement. 
11.  The
Guaranty states that it is a fully integrated agreement.
12.  –
27.  From April 17, 2018 through August
14, 2019, Cohen made interest payments required by Paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2 of
the Note in cash. Breslow’s secretary Barbara Efnor logged these payments in a
handwritten ledger and provided Cohen a copy of the ledger as a receipt of
payment. (TE4-01-02)
28.   Neither IC nor Cohen have made any payment of
interest towards the Note since August 14, 2019. 
29.   The Maturity Date (as defined in Paragraph 3.3
of the Note) ran on March 12, 2021.
30.  IC
has never directly made any payments toward the Principal Balance.
31.  IC
has not paid the entire outstanding Principal Balance of the Note, together
with all accrued but unpaid interest under the Note.
32.  Cohen
as not paid the entire outstanding Principal Balance of the Note, together with
all accrued but unpaid interest under the Note.
33.  Cohen
has not made a donation to Beit T’Shuvah in connection with the loan.
 THE MATERIAL ISSUES TO BE DETERMINED
Breslow
seeks damages from IC for breach of the Note and from Cohen for breach of the Guaranty.
More specifically, he seeks damages for principal and interest totaling
$523,660.34 as of April 1, 2024. Default was entered as to IC on January 23,
2020. 
Cohen
contends that he made seventeen additional cash payments to Breslow totaling
$170,000 that should be applied to the amount due under the Guaranty.
Additionally, Cohen asserts in his Third Affirmative Defense in his Answer that
the Loan and Guaranty are usurious because he was required to donate two
percent of the Loan amount to a charity called Beit T’Shuvah each year which
results in a usurious twelve percent interest rate per year. In his “Post Trial
Closing Trial Brief” (the “Cohen Closing Brief”), Cohen also contends that (a) the
use of a three-hundred-sixty-day year in the Note also results in a usurious
interest rate as well as an incorrect damage calculation, and (b) a $36.33
overpayment of interest also resulted in a usurious interest rate.[2]
The
following are the material issues to be determined by the Court:
A.  Did IC breach the Note?
 
B.  Did Cohen breach the Guaranty?
 
C.  Did Cohen pay Breslow seventeen payments of
$10,000 in cash to be applied toward the
      balance due on the Note?
 
D.  Is the interest rate on the Note usurious?
 
E.  If so, what impact does a usury finding have
on the damages claimed by Breslow?
 
F. If
not, what damages are owed to Breslow by Cohen and IC?
 
 
A.   
Did IC Breach the Note? 
 
As a result of stipulated fact nos. 15 and 16, there
is no dispute that IC breached the Note by failing to pay Breslow the
Principal Balance, together with all accrued but unpaid interest under the
Note.
B.   
Did Cohen Breach the Guaranty?
Cohen does not dispute that he breached the Guaranty. In the
Cohen Closing Brief at page 4, lines 5-7, he states that he “is only claiming
an offset of $170,000 and not the full $250,000. In other words under the
Guaranty, he admits there is a balance of $80,000 subject to further offset for
the usurious interest as applied to principal.” 
 
C.    Did
Cohen Pay Breslow Seventeen Payments of $10,000 in Cash to be Applied Toward
the Balance Due on the Note?
Cohen
contends that in addition to the monthly interest payments that he made in
cash, he
 also made seventeen additional cash payments toward
the Principal Balance. However, the Court did not find this contention credible
or supported by the evidence at trial. 
First,
Breslow testified that Cohen admitted
to Breslow soon after his default on October 1, 2019, that he had not made any
payments towards the Principal Balance. (Trial
Tr., Vol. 1 at 47:2-21.) 
Second, Cohen offered no written proof that he made
any of the alleged principal payments; this stands in contrast to the parties’
course of conduct regarding the interest payments where there was a written
record. With respect to the interest
payments, Cohen prepared a handwritten form of a ledger that he gave to
Breslow’s secretary. (TE4; Trial Tr., Vol.
2 at 20:5-11, 15-28, 21:1-2.) Each time Cohen made an interest payment,
Breslow’s secretary wrote in the amount of the payment and signed the form
ledger. (TE4; Trial Tr., Vol. 1 at
37:17-21.) She then gave Cohen an updated copy of the form ledger (Trial Tr., Vol. 2 at 21:13-22:1), and
Breslow’s secretary maintained the original form ledger, as updated, in her
files for the next payment. (Trial Tr.,
Vol. 1 at 37:17-27.)  
Cohen did not prepare a similar ledger for the alleged
principal payments, request a receipt for the alleged payments, or otherwise
contemporaneously note in writing any of the alleged payments worth
approximately five times the amount of the interest payments ($2,100 versus
$10,000). At trial, Cohen testified:
Q:        Mr. Cohen, did you receive a receipt from Mr. Breslow for any
of the $10,000 payments?
A:        Of course not.
Q:        And the $10,000 payments are not reflected on the ledger, is
that correct?
A:        Of course not.
Q:        And you don’t have a text message from Mr. Breslow confirming
receipt of any of the $10,000 payments, correct?
A:        Of course not.
Q:        And Mr. Breslow never sent you an e-mail confirming receipt
of any of the $10,000 payments in writing, sir? (Trial Tr., Vol. 2 at 22:7-19) 
The Witness:· That’s correct.
Q:        And, Mr. Breslow, never sent you anything in writing
confirming receipt of any of the $10,000 payments, correct?
A:        That’s correct. (Trial
Tr. Vol. 2 at 23:23-26.)
Q:        In fact, you never asked Mr. Breslow for a receipt for any of
the 10,000 payments; correct?
A:        Of course, it’s correct. (Trial
Tr. Vol. 2 at 24:2-4.)
Even though Cohen claims he received the
cash to make the alleged principal payments in the amount of $170,000 from IC,
Cohen also did not obtain a receipt or anything in writing from IC showing that
it gave Cohen the cash for the alleged principal payments. Cohen also never
confirmed in writing to IC that the payments were made. (Trial Tr. Vol. 2 at 24:5-25:25.) 
Cohen’s
inconsistent statements concerning the circumstances surrounding the alleged
principal payments stands in contrast to the undisputed and consistent evidence
concerning the circumstances of each interest payment. There is no dispute
that, with respect to the interest payments, Cohen came into Breslow’s office
each month and handed Breslow’s secretary the interest payment (except there
was one month where Cohen handed Breslow the interest payment at his office). (TE4-01; Trial Tr., Vol. 1 at 35:15-26.) In
every case, except one, the payment was made by Cohen in cash. (Trial Tr., Vol. 1 at 35:15-21.) The specific
dates of each payment are memorialized in the ledger. (TE4.) 
However, with respect to the alleged principal payments, Cohen provided
vague and/or contradictory facts concerning when and where he allegedly made
the payments. In supplemental responses to Breslow’s special interrogatories
that Cohen verified under penalty of perjury on September 5, 2020, Cohen
described the circumstances surrounding the purported principal payments.
(TE13.) Specifically in response to Special Interrogatory
No. 21, which asked: “[i]f you contend that you have made any payments towards
the principal due under the loan documents, state the dates and value of any
such payments,” Cohen responded: 
[a]ll payments came from cash supplied by IC
Funding and were paid to Breslow in cash. The cash was given to [Cohen] by
Nadav Ibi and was given to Mr. Breslow at either his home or his office in
Beverly Hills, California. There were 17 $10,000 payments, but [Cohen] does not
recall the dates other than they would have been after March of 2018 and before
March of 2019.
(Trial Tr., Vol. 2 at 31:28-32:21;
TE13.) At his deposition, Cohen confirmed that he did not recall the exact
dates that he made the alleged principal payments to Breslow. (Trial Tr., Vol. 2 at 33:2-11.) 
However, during direct examination, Cohen changed important aspects of
his story. For example, instead of testifying that he “does not recall the
dates other than they would have been after March of 2018 and before March of
2019,” Cohen testified that the alleged principal payments “coordinated with
the dates and times as the payment that I paid interest,” that there were 17
payments because “they just correspond with the dates here [referring to the
ledger].” (Trial Tr., Vol. 2 at
17:24-18:11; 18:16-18 [Q: “And would you do that after you gave the interest
payments to his secretary?” A: “Few times before but normally after.”].) 
During cross-examination, Cohen again changed his story and testified
that the payments could have been made a day or three days before or after the
interest payment was made (Trial Tr., Vol.
2 at 33:2-26), instead of corresponding to the date of the interest payment as
he testified on direct examination. Cohen also testified on direct examination
that he delivered “most” of these payments to Breslow “in his home.” (Trial Tr., Vol. 2 at 18:12-15.) In response
to the question on cross-examination, “Did you ever make any of the $10,000
payments at Mr. Breslow’s office?” Cohen responded unequivocally “No.” (Trial Tr., Vol. 2 at 30:26-28.) This
testimony is inconsistent with his response to Special Interrogatory No. 21 quoted above that the
“cash [for the alleged principal payments] was … given to Mr. Breslow at either
his home or his office in Beverly Hills, California.” (Trial Tr., Vol. 2 at 32:13-17, emphasis
added.)
Based upon the above evidence, the Court does not find the testimony of
Cohen to be credible regarding the purported seventeen payments of $10,000 in
cash. Consequently, no credit will be given to the amount due under the Note
and the Guaranty for such purported payments.  
 
D.       Is the Interest Rate in the Note Usurious?

In
the Cohen Closing Brief, Cohen asserts that the interest rate in the Note is
usurious for four reasons:  First, he
contends that because he paid $170,000 towards the Principal Balance, the
calculations on Exhibit 20, Breslow’s calculation of damages, are wrong and
exceed the amount owed. As discussed above, the Court does not find that Cohen
paid the $170,000, so there is no such calculation error.
            Second, Cohen contends that use of a
three-hundred-sixty-day year in the Note results in a rate of more than ten
percent interest. Cohen does not explain how the reference in the Note to a
three-hundred-sixty-day year results in a rate of interest in excess of ten
percent. In fact, paragraph 3.1 of the Note
states that the rate of interest per year on the Note is 10 percent, which
equals $25,000 per year in interest (10 percent of $250,000). (TE1, ¶ 3.1.) The
Note requires interest to be paid monthly. (TE1, ¶ 3.2.) $25,000
divided by 12 months is $2,083 per month, the amount shown as due each month on
Breslow’s calculation of damages. (TE20) This also is consistent with the way Cohen
calculated the monthly interest owed under the Note, as reflected by his
handwritten calculation on the top of TE4-01:
“250,000 @ 10% = 25,000 Int. Year. 25,000 ÷ 12 $2083/mo.” (TE4; Trial Tr., Vol. 2 at 20:15-24.) The evidence
shows that Cohen was not charged more than $25,000 in interest per year. As
noted by Breslow at trial, even if the interest had been based on a daily rate,
it would simply mean that there would be five days in which interest was not
charged. (Trial Tr., Vol. 1, 65:28-66:1-2
[“10 percent is calculated on 360 days. There is no interest charged on the
other five or six days.”].) 
In support of his three-hundred-sixty-day year theory, Cohen
relies on the case of Chern
v. Bank of America (1976) 15 Cal. 3d 866. There, plaintiff filed a
class action lawsuit for breach of contract and violation of Business and
Professional Code section
17500 concerning a loan. (Id.
at p. 869, 871.) The interest on the loan was calculated using a 9
percent stated rate divided by 360 to determine a daily rate. This
daily rate was then multiplied by the number of days the loan is
outstanding. In this calculation, the use of a 360-day year instead of a
365-day year resulted in the annual rate on the loan being 9.125 percent
instead of the stated 9 percent. (Id.
at p. 870.) The court found this to be misleading. Here, the interest on
the loan was not calculated based on a daily rate and then multiplied by the
number of days the loan is outstanding. As shown above, the interest was paid monthly,
and the calculation started with the total annual interest (10 percent of
$250,000, or $25,000) and then divided by 12 months to reach the monthly amount
due (or, $2,083 per month). Consequently, the Court does not find that the
reference to a three-hundred-sixty-day year makes the Note usurious.
Third,
Cohen contends that because he was required to make a donation to Beit T’Shuvah
of two percent in order to secure the loan from Breslow, that requirement made
the Note usurious. However, as pointed out by Breslow, Cohen never made the
donation to Beit T’Shuvah. (Stip. Fact 33;
Trial Tr., Vol. 2 at 14:23-15:18.) Cohen claims
that this fact is irrelevant to his usury defense. However, Cohen does not cite
any legal authority in support of this claim. As Breslow points out in his
Reply in Support of Post-Trial Closing Brief, “[a] transaction is not usurious, so as to
require the lender to refund usurious interest received by him until there has
been an actual payment of usurious interest.” (Domarad v.
Fisher & Burke, Inc. (1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 543, 560, citing Penziner v. West American Finance Co., 10
Cal.2d 160, 179.)
Finally, Cohen claims that he actually paid
more than ten percent interest because he made an overpayment of $36.33. (Cohen
Closing Brief, p. 5, ll. 10-18.) However, Breslow established that $36.34 was applied to the outstanding principal balance as
shown in the first 17 lines of the “Over/Under Payment” and “Balance” columns
on TE20. (Breslow’s Post-Trial Closing
Brief, 11:12 [“The outstanding principal
amount on the Note totaling $249,963.66”]; fn 6 [“Cohen overpaid the required
monthly interest by $36.34. Per Paragraphs 3.7 and 6.5 of the Note (TE1), this
partial prepayment was applied to the principal balance.”].) Thus, Cohen never
paid any interest over the legal rate. This is in accord with Sections 3.7 and 6.5 of the Note, which
provide:
3.7       Prepayments.
Borrower shall have the right to prepay all or any part of the outstanding
principal balance of this Note, without penalty or premium, at any time. Any
partial prepayment shall be applied to principal and shall not alter the
amount or due date of the scheduled monthly or other payments due hereunder.
6.5       Interest
Rate Limitation. The provisions of this Note and of all agreements between
Borrower and Lender are expressly limited so that in no contingency shall the
amount paid, or agreed to be paid, for the use, forbearance, or detention of
the money to be loaned hereunder exceed the maximum amount permissible by law.
…, and if, from any circumstance whatsoever, Lender should ever receive
as interest an amount that would exceed the highest lawful rate, the amount
that would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the
principal balance owing hereunder (or, at Lender's option, be paid over to
Borrower) and shall not be counted as interest.
(TE1, ¶¶ 3.7, 6.5, emphasis added.)
The
Court does not find that any of the four theories advanced by Cohen establish
that the Note was usurious.
E.    What
Damages Are Owed By IC and Cohen?
Because
the Court finds that the evidence did not show that the Principal Balance
should
be reduced based upon any
principal payments by Cohen, and because the Court did not find that Cohen had
proven any of the grounds alleged by him for finding that the Note was
usurious, IC and Cohen owe Breslow the amount of $523,660.34 as of April 1,
2024, plus attorney fees and costs pursuant to paragraph 6.4 of the Note and paragraph
12(d) of the Guaranty. 
II.            
CONCLUSION
            The Court finds in favor of Breslow and awards damages in
the amount of $523,660.34, plus attorney fees and costs per motion.  Within ten days after this Statement of
Decision becomes final, Breslow is ordered to file and serve a proposed
judgment in accordance with these findings (with a courtesy copy delivered to
Dept. 50). The Court hereby dismisses the Doe defendants.
            Breslow is ordered to give notice of this tentative and
proposed Statement of Decision.
DATED:  April 24, 2024
