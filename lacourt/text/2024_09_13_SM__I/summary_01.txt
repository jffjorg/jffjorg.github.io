Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English:

The court is concerned about the proposed default judgments in this case, which total approximately $11 million. The court has rejected prior proposed default judgments due to a lack of clarity regarding the life plan and costs. The court is particularly concerned about the witness's testimony, which relied on the opinions of treating physicians and experts, but did not provide sufficient detail about how the costs were determined. The court is also concerned about the lack of information regarding discounts and present value adjustments. As a result, the court has scheduled a hearing for September 13, 2024, to discuss the proposed judgments and ensure that the court has sufficient information to make an informed decision. The court also wants to ensure that the service of the Statements of Damages was proper and that there was sufficient time between service and the entry of default.
