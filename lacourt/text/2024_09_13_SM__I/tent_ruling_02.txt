 Case Number:  20SMCV01901    Hearing Date:   September 13, 2024    Dept:  I The motion to compel is GRANTED.  The request for sanctions is GRANTED as
against plaintiffs, but not counsel, in the reduced amount of $2060, payable
within 30 days.  The reduction is to
account for the fact that no opposition was filed and therefore there was not
need to review it or prepare a reply to it.
 
Verified responses without objection will be served within
10 calendar days of today.  The short
time frame is because the trial is coming up quickly.
