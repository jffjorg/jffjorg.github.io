And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled on the motion to quash and demurrer filed by Defendant Advocare International, LLC. The Plaintiff, Dana Hughes, has filed a Complaint alleging a violation of the California Invasion of Privacy Act's (CIPA) Trap and Trace Law. The Defendant has moved to quash service of process and demurrer, arguing that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over the Defendant because it is a Delaware limited liability company with its principal place of business in Texas.

The Judge has granted Plaintiff's request for 90 days leave to amend the Complaint and add more facts regarding Defendant's contacts with California after conducting limited discovery on personal jurisdiction issues. The hearing on the motion to quash and demurrer is continued to March 14, 2025, at 8:30 a.m., and the Case Management Conference is also continued to March 14, 2025, at 8:30 a.m.

The Judge has also noted that the Plaintiff's Complaint is unverified and lacks evidence, and that the Defendant has not purposefully availed itself of California. The Judge has cited various cases, including State of Oregon v. Superior Court, Buchanan v. Soto, and Jacqueline B. v. Rawls Law Group, P.C., in support of its ruling.
