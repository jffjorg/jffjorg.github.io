Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et seq.On May 9, 2023, Defendant Active was served with the summons and complaint by substituted service. Also, on May 9, 2023, Defendant Donaldson was served with the summons and complaint by substituted service.On July 13, 2023, default was entered against Defendants Active and Donaldson.On December 4, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a default judgment application.On December 18, 2023, the Court ordered Plaintiffs to submit a supplemental declaration in support of the 585 Default Package. (12/18/23 Minute Order.)On January 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed respective declarations in support of their default judgment application.On January 24, 2024, this action was reassigned from the Honorable Ronald F. Frank to the Honorable David K. Reinert sitting in Department P at Torrance Courthouse effective January 29, 2024.II. FACTUAL BACKGROUNDPlaintiffs allege that Defendants failed to, among other wrongful actions, provide them with the requisite uninterrupted meal and rest periods, as well as failed to pay Plaintiffs all wages owed to them upon discharge or resignation. (Complaint, ¶¶ 32-33.)Plaintiffs now move for default judgment against Defendants.III. LEGAL STANDARDCalifornia Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800 sets forth the requirements for default judgments. In pertinent part, the rule dictates that a party must use form CIV-100 and file the following documents with the clerk: (1) except in unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties and the nature of plaintiff's claim; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3)¿interest computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5)¿a declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is sought; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8)¿exhibits as necessary; and (9)¿a request for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800(a)(1)-(9).)IV. DISCUSSIONThe Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to meet the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800 to obtain entry of default judgment against Defendants. Plaintiffs have failed to: (1) provide a brief summary of the case; (2) provide a signed memorandum of costs and disbursements; and (3) dismiss the Doe defendants. The Court also notes that there is a discrepancy in the amount of interest requested. The CIV-100 forms as to Defendants Active and Donaldson, respectively, request interest in the amount of $2,693.47; however, the proposed form of judgment (JUD-100) requests interest against Defendants in the sum of $585.35. Additionally, there is an inconsistency in the total amount of judgment to be entered as the CIV-100 forms request total judgment of $31,270.78 whereas the JUD-100 form requests a total judgment of $29,367.94.V. CONCLUSIONBased on the foregoing, Plaintiffs’ default judgment application is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
