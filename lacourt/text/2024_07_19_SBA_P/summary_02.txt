And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's default judgment application without prejudice. The plaintiff, Umpqua Bank, filed a complaint against defendants Simon Park Holdings and Simon Park alleging causes of action for possession of personal property, deficiency judgment, foreclosure of security interest, breach of express contract, money lent, account stated, and conversion. The defendants were served with the summons and complaint on January 9, 2024, and default was entered against them on February 22, 2024. The plaintiff now seeks a default judgment against the defendants in the sum of $785,006.72.

However, the judge finds that the plaintiff has failed to meet the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800, which sets forth the requirements for default judgments. Specifically, the plaintiff failed to provide adequate interest computations and did not cite to the precise clause providing for attorneys' fees. Therefore, the court denies the plaintiff's default judgment application without prejudice, allowing the plaintiff to re-file the application after addressing these deficiencies.
