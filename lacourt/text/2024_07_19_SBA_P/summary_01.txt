Here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court denies the default judgment application without prejudice. The court finds that the plaintiffs have failed to meet the requirements for default judgment as set forth in California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800. Specifically, the plaintiffs failed to provide a brief summary of the case, a signed memorandum of costs and disbursements, and dismissed the Doe defendants. Additionally, there is a discrepancy in the amount of interest requested. The court notes that the plaintiffs' failure to comply with the requirements is not sufficient to justify the entry of default judgment.
