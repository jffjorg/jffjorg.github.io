```

The judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to their second set of requests for production is denied. The judge finds that the plaintiff's requests are overbroad and that the plaintiff failed to specifically identify the types of defects in the other vehicles and their relevance to the plaintiff's claims. The judge also notes that the defendant provided substantive responses to the requests and that the plaintiff ignored these responses in their motion.
