Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Harvey Vechery’s Application for Default
Judgment is DENIED without prejudice
and the entry of default against Defendant Greg J. Halpern is VACATED.
BACKGROUND
On October
19, 2023, Plaintiff Harvey Vechery filed a complaint against Defendant Greg J.
Halpern, alleging a cause of action for breach of contract based upon Halpern’s
alleged failure to repay a loan. On January 25, 2024, Vechery’s process server
served Halpern with substitute service in Spring Grove, Illinois.
On March
26, 2024, the Court entered default against Halpern after Halpern failed to
file a timely answer. On May 8, 2024, Vechery submitted the present application
for default judgment.
A case
management conference/OSC Re: Default is set for June 25, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Vechery
seeks default judgment against Halpern in the total amount of $1,672,196.27,
including $1,365,104.86 in damages, $287,233.00 in interest, $18,308.66 in
attorney fees, and $1,549.75 in costs.¿For the following reasons, the Court DENIES
Vechery’s application without prejudice.
“A
default judgment entered against a defendant who was not served in the manner
prescribed by statute is void.” (First American Title Insurance Company v.
Banerjee (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 37, 292.) “An individual may be served by
substitute service only after a good faith effort at personal service has first
been made: the burden is on the plaintiff to show that the summons and
complaint ‘cannot with reasonable diligence be personally delivered’ to
defendants. [Citations.] Two or three attempts to personally serve a defendant
at a proper place ordinarily qualifies as ‘reasonable diligence.’” (American
Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 389.) (Italics
added.)
Here, Vechery
filed an affidavit of service that states Vechery’s process server served
Halpern on January 25, 2024, at an address in Spring Grove, Illinois through
substitute service. But the affidavit does not include a declaration of
diligence that describes any previous attempts to serve Halpern at that
address. Furthermore, the affidavit does not include the language required by
Code of Civil Procedure section 2015.5. Thus, the Court finds Vechery has not
established proper service of Halpern and vacates the underlying default.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Vechery’s
application for default judgment is DENIED without prejudice and the
entry of default as to Halpern is VACATED.
