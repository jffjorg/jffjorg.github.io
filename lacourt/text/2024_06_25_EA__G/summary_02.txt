And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Harvey Vechery's application for default judgment against Defendant Greg J. Halpern. The Judge denies the application without prejudice and vacates the entry of default against Halpern. The Judge finds that Vechery has not established proper service of Halpern, as the affidavit of service does not include a declaration of diligence or the required language from Code of Civil Procedure section 2015.5. The Judge cites precedent stating that a default judgment entered against a defendant who was not served in the manner prescribed by statute is void. As a result, the application for default judgment is denied, and the entry of default against Halpern is vacated.
