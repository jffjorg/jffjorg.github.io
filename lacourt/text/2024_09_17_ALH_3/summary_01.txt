And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of CAFÉ ON LEMON, INC. (Plaintiff) vs. LOUIS PETRIE SEPARATE PROPERTY TRUST, et al. (Defendant). The Defendant, Dilys Jones, trustee of the Louis Petrie Separate Property Trust, moves for an order compelling the Plaintiff to serve responses to Requests for Production, Set One, which were propounded on March 12, 2024. The Plaintiff failed to serve timely responses, and the Defendant seeks monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,995.

The Judge grants the Motion and orders the Plaintiff to serve verified responses without objections to the Defendant's Requests for Production of Documents (Set One) within 20 days of the date of this Order. The Judge also imposes a monetary sanction against the Plaintiff in the amount of $285 for 1 hour at defense counsel's hourly rate of $285. The Plaintiff is required to pay this sanction within 20 days of the date of this Order.

The Judge notes that the Plaintiff's failure to serve timely responses waives any objections to the requests, including those based on privilege or attorney work product. The Judge also finds that there is no evidence of substantial justification or unjustness for the sanction, and therefore grants the Defendant's request for monetary sanctions.
