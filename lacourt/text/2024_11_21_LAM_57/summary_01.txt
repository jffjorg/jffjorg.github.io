And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on the defendant's objections to the plaintiff's designations of excerpts from depositions of witnesses from the Sheriff's Department. The judge overruled objections to designations made by Bobby Olivares, Erin Rosario, and Juan Sanchez. However, the judge sustained an objection made by David Vasquez on the grounds that the question was asked and answered. The judge also noted that there were no objections to designations for Manuel Palacios, Jerry Lopez, and Francisco Mendoza, and that no ruling could be made on objections to designations for Argelia Huerta because no transcript was provided. The judge previously ruled on similar objections made in the plaintiff's opening statement.
