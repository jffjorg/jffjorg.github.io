And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a petition for judicial declaration of abandonment of a mobile home. The petitioner, Sherwood Mobile Home Park, filed the petition against the respondent, Lawrence F. Fitzgerald Jr., alleging that the respondent has abandoned the mobile home. The petitioner posted a 30-day notice of abandonment and mailed it to the respondent, but the respondent failed to pay rent or storage costs. The judge finds that the petitioner failed to show by a preponderance of evidence that the criteria for an abandoned mobile home has been satisfied. The judge also finds that the petitioner failed to comply with certain requirements of California Civil Code §798.61, including providing the total amount of judgment sought for unpaid rent and declaring whether the management intends to sell the contents of the abandoned mobile home before its disposal. As a result, the judge continues the petition to October 9, 2024, to allow the petitioner to file a revised petition.
