And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court is considering a motion for reconsideration filed by Ed Carroll Motor Company, Inc. (Defendant) regarding the denial of the motion to compel arbitration. The court finds that the motion is timely and that the Defendant has presented new facts and circumstances that warrant reconsideration. Specifically, the court notes the recent decision in Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC, which held that the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act does not apply to used vehicles if the used dealership did not issue its own warranty and if the new car warranty was not issued at the time of sale.

The court concludes that the claims against Ed Carroll are barred by the Rodriguez decision, as Ed Carroll did not provide a dealership warranty and the manufacturer's warranty was not issued at the time of sale. The court grants the motion to compel arbitration of the claims against Ed Carroll and orders the claims to be resolved through binding arbitration. The court does not stay the claims against the remaining defendants.
