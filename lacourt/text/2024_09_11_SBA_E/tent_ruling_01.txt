BACKGROUND
On February 9, 2022, Plaintiff The Hild
Corporation dba Industrial High Voltage (“Plaintiff” or “IHV”) filed this
action against Defendants Jason Paul Guillen (“Guillen”), Tyson B. Schilz
(“Schilz”), Industrial Line Voltage LLC (“ILV”), Gectwo, Inc. (“Gectwo”), and
Does 1 through 10, inclusive, asserting causes of action for (1) conversion,
(2) intentional interference with contractual relations, (3) intentional
interference with prospective economic advantage, (4) negligent interference
with prospective economic advantage, and (5) unfair competition under Business
and Professions Code section 17200.
 
The Complaint alleges the following. Plaintiff
is a licensed low voltage contracting company. (Compl., ¶ 1.) “In
January of 2022, GUILLEN quit his job with IHV. GUILLEN [then] proceeded to form
ILV, together with SCHILZ and GECTWO. The Defendants … contacted IHV’s clients
and made false representations that IHV was out of business and did not have
the ability to fulfill its contracts. The Defendants [also] coordinated job
walk-offs by IHV’s employees and stole IHV’s equipment and proprietary work
product.” (Compl., ¶
8.) “The Defendants … [have] wrongfully dispossessed IHV of its physical and
proprietary property. IHV is informed, believes, and based thereon alleges that
GUILLEN is in possession of a work laptop …; … a set of keys that can access
IHV’s main office; … [and] multiple sets of fire retardant clothing; and, that
the Defendants are in possession of IHV’s aforementioned proprietary
information.” (Compl., ¶ 14.) “IHV was harmed, and … the conduct of Defendants
… was a substantial factor in causing harm to IHV. As a direct and proximate
result of defendants’ … breaches, Plaintiff has sustained damages … exceed[ing]
$1,000,000.00.” (Compl., ¶ 15.) 
 
            On September 11,
2023, the Court granted Schilz and GECTWO’s motion for summary judgment. 
 
            Therefore, the only
remaining named defendants are ILV and Guillen. 
 
            On October 27, 2023,
Plaintiff filed the instant motions to compel ILV and Guillen’s further
responses to Plaintiff’s special interrogatories and demand for production of
documents. 
 
            On December 29, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a Notice of Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”) regarding those
motions. The notice stated (among other things) that the parties met and
conferred regarding their IDC availability and the court clerk set April 25,
2024 as the date for the IDC. 
 
            On April 25, 2024,
pursuant to oral stipulation, the Court continued the IDC for the motions to
compel to June 27, 2024. 
 
            On June 27, 2024, the
Court held the IDC, ordered the parties to meet and confer regarding the
discovery at issue, and continued the hearings for the motions to compel to
their current date on September 11, 2024. 
 
            On July 17, 2024, the
case was reassigned to this Court (Dept. E) and Plaintiff was ordered to give
notice. 
 
            On July 25, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a Notice of Case Reassignment. 
 
            As of September 9,
2024, no opposition or reply concerning the motions has been filed. In
addition, no supplemental papers have been filed informing the Court whether
the parties met and conferred as ordered on June 27, 2024, and the outcome of
that meet and confer process. 
 
Therefore, the Court will rule on the motions
on their merits. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
“Unless
otherwise limited by order of the court …, any party may obtain discovery
regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter
involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion made in
that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.) 
 
“For
discovery purposes, information is relevant if it ‘might reasonably assist a
party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating
settlement.…’ [Citation.] Admissibility is not the test and information, unless
privileged, is discoverable if it might reasonably lead to admissible
evidence.”(Gonzalez v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546.)
 
“On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the
propounding party deems that any of the following apply: ¶ (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory
is evasive or incomplete. ¶ (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents
under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those
documents is inadequate. ¶ (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without
merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)  
 
Similarly, “[o]n
receipt of a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further response
to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the following apply: ¶
(1) A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete. ¶ (2) A
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. ¶
(3) An objection in the response is without merit or too general.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).) 
 
 
 
A motion to compel
further response to requests for production of documents “shall set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) “Good cause” has been defined “as requiring that the party [1] produce
specific facts justifying discovery and [2] that the inquiry be relevant to the
subject matter of the action or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery
of admissible evidence.” (Vinson v. Superior Court (1987) 43 Cal.3d 833,
840.) 
 
The good cause rule does not apply to
motions to compel further responses to interrogatories. 
 
TIMELINESS
 
Motions to compel further responses to
interrogatories and demand for production of documents must be brought within
45 days of service of the verified response, supplemental verified response, or
on a date to which the propounding and responding parties have agreed to in
writing; otherwise, the propounding party waives the right to compel further
responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (c); 2031.310, subd. (c).)
 
Here, Plaintiff’s counsel testifies (and
defendants have not filed any opposition disputing) that the parties agreed to
extend the deadline for Plaintiff to file the motions to October 27, 2023. (Declaration
of Sumner Schwartz, filed on October 27, 2023 (“Schwartz Decl.”), ¶ 8.)
 
Therefore, the motions are timely because they
were filed on the agreed upon date. 
 
MEET AND CONFER 
 
The instant motions to compel further
responses must be accompanied by meet and confer declarations. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (b)(1); 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)
 
Plaintiff has satisfied the meet and confer
requirement. (Schwartz Decl., ¶¶
4-9.)
 
SEPARATE STATEMENT
 
Plaintiff has also filed separates statements
as required. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a)(2) and (3) [requiring motions
to compel further responses to interrogatories and demand for inspection of
documents to be accompanied by a separate statement]; Separate Statements filed
on October 27, 2023.)
 
DEMAND FOR PRODUCTION SERVED UPON GUILLEN
 
Plaintiff
moves for an order compelling Guillen to serve further responses to Plaintiff’s
Demand for Production and Inspection of Documents and Things, Set No. Two (the
“G-DFPs”), Nos. 17, 19, 22-25, 29-35 and 39-42. 
 
However,
G-DFP No. 22 was not in Plaintiff’s separate statement.
 
Therefore,
the request to compel further response to G-DFP No. 22 is DENIED. 
 
Before
discussing the Court’s rulings on the other G-DFPs, the Court notes that in
many of his responses, Guillen argued that the requests seek privileged,
proprietary, and confidential business information, or trade secrets. 
 
To the extent
Guillen believes some requests are seeking privileged information, the
defendant is ordered to produce a privilege log. (People ex rel. Lockyer v. Superior Court (2004)
122 Cal.App.4th 1060, 1075 [“[T]here is no obligation to produce a privilege
log at all [in response to requests for production of documents], unless
ordered to do so by the court upon a motion by a party seeking such a document
[e.g., a motion to compel further responses”]]; Catalina Island Yacht Club
v. Superior Court (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1127 [“The precise information required for an adequate
privilege log will vary from case to case based on the privileges asserted and
the underlying circumstances. In general, however, a privilege log typically
should provide the identity and capacity of all individuals who authored, sent,
or received each allegedly privileged document, the document's date, a brief
description of the document and its contents or subject matter sufficient to
determine whether the privilege applies, and the precise privilege or
protection asserted”].)
 
To the extent
that the requests seek proprietary, confidential, or trade secret information,
Guillen can move for a protective order. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.060, subd. (a) [“When an inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling of documents, tangible things, places, or
electronically stored information has been demanded, the party to whom the
demand has been directed, and any other party or affected person, may promptly
move for a protective order. This motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040”]; id. at subd. (b) [“The
court, for good cause shown, may make any order that justice requires to
protect any party or other person from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or
oppression, or undue burden and expense”].)
 
Here, Guillen
has filed a motion for protective order. 
 
Therefore,
the Court finds the defendant’s proprietary, confidential, and trade secret objections
unpersuasive. 
 
The Court
also finds unpersuasive Guillen’s objection that some requests are duplicative
of other requests for production because Guillen has not supplied the Court with
enough information to make that determination. 
 
·       G-DFP No. 17 asked Guillen to produce the
following: ALL DOCUMENTS identified in YOUR responses to
Special Interrogatories, Set Two, served concurrently herewith.
 
The request
to compel further response to G-DFP No. 17 is DENIED because it is vague
(unclear what “identified” means), it is overly broad, and unduly burdensome. 
 
·       G-DFP No. 19: ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO
COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and PLAINTIFF’S clients.
 
The request to compel further response to G-DFP
No. 19 is GRANTED. The request seeks relevant information given Plaintiff’s
allegations. Guillen’s overbroad, vague, ambiguous, unduly burdensome,
irrelevant, immaterial, and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery
of admissible evidence are without merit. Likewise, his alternative response
that the request is duplicative, and the request was asked for and answered in a
previous request for production is unpersuasive because he has not specified
which request it is duplicative of. 
 
·      
G-DFP No. 23: ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO
INDUSTRIAL HIGH VOLTAGE LLC’S proprietary bidding formulas in YOUR possession
or control.
·      
G-DFP No. 24: ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO
GECTWO, INC.’S proprietary bidding formulas in YOUR possession or control.
 
In response to Nos. 23 and 24 Guillen gave the
same objections and alternative response as No. 19 above. 
 
Therefore, the request to compel further
response to G-DFP Nos. 23 and 24 is GRANTED for the same reasons the
Court has granted the request above. 
 
·      
G-DFP No. 25: ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO
PLAINTIFF’S missing construction materials, including the fire retardant
clothing, special insulating blankets aka electrical Arc protection blankets,
scrap copper, and splice kits.
 
Guillen objected to No. 25, arguing that the production
would invade his right of privacy, seeks confidential documents, and is
duplicative. 
 
Guillen has not explained the basis for his
right of privacy argument and the Court has addressed the confidential
documents and duplicative arguments above. 
 
Accordingly, the request to compel further
response to G-DFP No. 25 is GRANTED.
 
·      
G-DFP No. 29: ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO
coordinating GECTWO, INC.’S bids on potential projects to be lower than the
bids of PLAINTIFF with the assistance of Dan Sellers.
·      
G-DFP No. 30: ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO
coordinating GECTWO, INC.’S bids on potential projects to be lower than the
bids of PLAINTIFF with the assistance of Jesus “Jessie” Villareal.
·      
G-DFP No. 31: ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO
coordinating GECTWO, INC.’S bids on potential projects to be lower than the
bids of PLAINTIFF with the assistance of any of PLAINTIFF’S employees from June
2021 to June 2022.
 
The Court agrees with Guillen the above
request is vague. Indeed, the Complaint, separate statement, and motion do not
explain who Dan Sellers and Jesus “Jessie” Villareal are. In addition, the
phrase “relating to coordinating” is confusing. 
 
Accordingly, the request to compel further
response to G-DFP Nos. 29, 30, and 31 is DENIED.
 
·      
G-DFP No. 32: ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO
INDUSTRIAL LINE VOLTAGE LLC’S bids on potential projects from June of 2021 to
June of 2022.
 
Guillen objected to No. 32 “to the extent that
it calls for responses containing privileged, proprietary and/or confidential business
information or trade secrets.” (G-DFP Separate Statement, p. 11:18-21.)
 
The Court has addressed those objections
above. 
 
Accordingly, the request to compel further
response to G-DFP No. 32 is GRANTED.
 
·      
G-DFP No. 33: ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO
GECTWO, INC.’S bids on potential projects from June of 2021 to June of 2022.
 
The Court finds Guillen’s objections to No. 33
(i.e., the request is overbroad, vague, ambiguous, unduly burdensome,
irrelevant, immaterial, and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery
of admissible evidence) unpersuasive. The Complaint is based on events that
occurred in or after January 2022, and, therefore, limiting the request for
production to a year, between June 2021 and June 2022 is reasonable. 
 
Accordingly, the request to compel further
response to G-DFP No. 33 is GRANTED.
 
·      
G-DFP No. 34: ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO the
ownership structure and equity distribution of INDUSTRIAL LINE VOLTAGE LLC.
·      
G-DFP No. 35: ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO the
ownership structure and equity distribution of GECTWO, INC.
 
The request to compel further response to G-DFP
Nos. 34 and 35 is GRANTED because the objections and alternative responses
are unpersuasive. 
 
·      
G-DFP No. 39: ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO
COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and PLAINTIFF’S employees, agents and/or
representatives RELATED TO PLAINTIFF’S property in the possession of employees,
agents, or representatives since June of 2021.
 
The request to compel further response to G-DFP
No. 39 is GRANTED. Guillen stated in his response that he “has diligently
checked its records including all records in its possession or reasonably
available to responding party
and was unable to find any documents responsive to this request.” (G-DFP
Separate Statement, p. 16:12-16.) However, the response did not “specify
whether the inability to comply is because the particular item or category has
never existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has
never been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the
responding party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.230.)
 
·      
G-DFP No. 40: ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO
purchases of fire retardant clothing by INDUSTRIAL LINE VOLTAGE LLC since June
of 2021.
·      
 G-DFP
No. 41: ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO purchases of fire retardant clothing by
GECTWO, INC. since June of 2021.
·      
G-DFP No. 43: ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO office
staff who perform secretarial office work for both INDUSTRIAL LINE VOLTAGE LLC
and GECTWO, INC.
·      
G-DFP No. 44: ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO shared
emails between employees of both INDUSTRIAL LINE VOLTAGE LLC and GECTWO, INC.
 
The Court agrees that Nos. 40, 41, 43, and 44
are overbroad and documents “relating to” could mean anything. 
 
Therefore, the request to compel further
response to G-DFP Nos. 40, 41, 43, and 44 is DENIED.
 
DEMAND
FOR PRODUCTION SERVED UPON ILV
 
Plaintiff moves for an order compelling ILV to
serve further responses to Plaintiff’s Demand for Production and Inspection of
Documents and Things, Set No. Two (the “I-DFP”), Nos. 17, 19, 26-28, 33-36 and
39.
 
·      
I-DFP No. 17 asked Guillen to produce the
following: ALL DOCUMENTS identified in YOUR responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set Two, served concurrently herewith.
 
The request to compel further response to I-DFP
No. 17 is DENIED for the same reasons the Court has denied G-DFP No. 17
above. 
 
·      
I-DFP No. 19: ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO
COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and employees of SASCO Electric.
 
The request to compel further response to I-DFP
No. 19 is DENIED. The Complaint, separate statement, and motion do not
explain who SASCO Electric is. Therefore, Plaintiff has failed to show good
cause to compel a further response. 
 
·      
I-DFP No. 26: ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO
coordinating INDUSTRIAL LINE VOLTAGE LLC’S bids on potential projects to be
lower than the bids of PLAINTIFF with the assistance of any of PLAINTIFF’S
employees from June 2021 to June 2022.
 
The request to compel further response to I-DFP
No. 26 is GRANTED. Although ILV objected to the request (e.g., on the
grounds that it is vague), ILV served an alternative response saying that it “has
diligently checked its records including all records in its possession or
reasonably available to responding party and was unable to find any documents
responsive to this request.” (I-DFP Separate Statement, p. 4:10-12.) However,
ILV did not “specify whether the
inability to comply is because the particular item or category has never
existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never
been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding
party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.230.)
 
·      
I-DFP No. 27: ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO
INDUSTRIAL LINE VOLTAGE LLC’S bids on potential projects from June of 2021 to
June of 2022.
·      
I-DFP No. 28: ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO the
ownership structure and equity distribution of INDUSTRIAL LINE VOLTAGE LLC.
 
ILV objected to Nos. 27 and 28 to the extent the
request contained privileged, proprietary and/or confidential business
information or trade secrets.
 
The Court incorporates its ruling regarding
those objections from the G-DFP motion.
 
 Accordingly, the request to compel further
responses to I-DFP Nos. 27-28 is GRANTED.
 
·      
I-DFP No. 33: ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO
purchases of fire retardant clothing by INDUSTRIAL LINE VOLTAGE LLC since June
of 2021.
·      
I-DFP No. 34: ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO joint
employment of employees by both INDUSTRIAL LINE VOLTAGE LLC and GECTWO, INC.,
since June of 2021.
·      
I-DFP No. 35: ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO office
staff who perform secretarial office work for both INDUSTRIAL LINE VOLTAGE LLC
and GECTWO, INC.
·      
I-DFP No. 36: ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO shared
emails between employees of both INDUSTRIAL LINE VOLTAGE LLC and GECTWO, INC.
·      
I-DFP No. 39: ALL ELECTRONIC RECORDS relating
to the DOCUMENTS produced pursuant to Request for Productions Nos. 17 through
38, as set forth hereinabove.
 
The Court agrees with ILV that the above
requests are vague. 
 
Therefore, the request to compel further
responses to I-DFP Nos. 33, 34, 35, 36, and 39 is DENIED. 
 
SPECIAL
INTERROGATORIES PROPOUNDED ON GUILLEN
 
Plaintiff moves for an order compelling
Guillen to serve further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set No. Two
(“G-SROG”), Nos. 81, 83-91, 97-115, 137-142, 146-149 and 150-165 according to its motion. 
 
However, that
Plaintiff’s G-SROG separate statement also discusses Nos. 143, 144, 145. Since
Plaintiff has not indicated that it is moving to compel further responses to
those interrogatories in its motion, the Court will not issue rulings
concerning those interrogatories. 
 
·      
G-SROG No. 81 asked Guillen: Please describe
any and all DOCUMENTS that evidence any FACTS that support YOUR response to
SPECIAL INTERROGATORY NO. 2.
 
Plaintiff has not provided information
regarding Special Interrogatory No. 2 and, therefore, the request to compel
further response to G-SROG No. 81 is DENIED. 
·      
G-SROG No. 83: DESCRIBE IN DETAIL any
DOCUMENTS CONCERNING the circumstances of the PLAINTIFF’S employees quitting
their jobs.
 
The Court agrees with Guillen G-SROG No. 83 is
vague. 
 
Therefore, the request to compel further
response to G-SROG No. 83 is DENIED.
 
·      
G-SROG No. 84: Please IDENTIFY each PERSON who
complained to YOU about their employment with PLAINTIFF.
 
Plaintiff states that defense counsel told
Plaintiff’s counsel that Plaintiff’s employees left because Plaintiff did not
have enough hours. Therefore, the Court finds No. 84 seeks relevant
information. 
 
Accordingly, the request to compel further
response to G-SROG No. 84 is GRANTED.
 
·      
G-SROG No. 85: How did YOU advertise
INDUSTRIAL LINE VOLTAGE LLC to potential clients?
·      
G-SROG No. 86: Please describe any and all
DOCUMENTS that evidence any FACTS that support YOUR response to SPECIAL INTERROGATORY
85.
·      
G-SROG No. 87: Please IDENTIFY each PERSON who
has knowledge of the FACTS supporting YOUR response to SPECIAL INTERROGATORY
85.
 
The Court finds Guillen’s objections to the
above requests, including the objection that they call for a legal conclusion,
unpersuasive. (See West Pico Furniture Co. of Los Angeles v. Superior Court
In and For Los Angeles County (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417 [explaining the
fact that an interrogatory calls for opinions or conclusions “that fact, of
itself, is not a proper objection to an interrogatory. Such objection may be
proper when the answer is intended to have probative value, but it may not be
utilized on discovery as a means of preventing a party from obtaining
information that will lead him to probative facts [citation]”].)
 
Accordingly, the request to compel further
response to G-SROG Nos. 85, 86, and 87 is GRANTED.
 
·      
G-SROG No. 88: DESCRIBE IN DETAIL how YOU
became a member of INDUSTRIAL LINE VOLTAGE LLC.
·      
G-SROG No. 89: DESCRIBE IN DETAIL YOUR partial
ownership of INDUSTRIAL LINE VOLTAGE LLC. Include YOUR percentage of ownership
when answering this interrogatory.
 
The Court finds Guillen’s objections to the
above requests unpersuasive. 
 
Accordingly, the request to compel further
response to G-SROG Nos. 88-89 is GRANTED.
 
·      
G-SROG No. 90: Did YOU ever disclose YOUR
financial interest in a competing electrical subcontractor to YOUR employer,
the PLAINTIFF?
 
Guillen responded “Not Applicable. No such
financial interest existed while Responding Party was Plaintiff’s Employee.”
(G-SROG Separate Statement, p. 11:17-19.) That response was sufficient. 
 
Accordingly, the request to compel further
response to G-SROG No. 90 is DENIED.
 
·      
G-SROG No. 91: DESCRIBE IN DETAIL YOUR
responsibilities to INDUSTRIAL LINE VOLTAGE LLC while YOU concurrently worked
for the PLAINTIFF.
 
Guillen responded “Not Applicable. No such
responsibilities existed while Responding Party was working for Plaintiff.”
(G-SROG Separate Statement, p. 12:21-23.) That response was sufficient. 
 
Accordingly, the request to compel further
response to G-SROG No. 91 is DENIED.
 
·      
G-SROG No. 97: To YOUR knowledge, who on IHV’S
staff had access to IHV’S client contact information? 
 
Guillen responded with objections but also
stated “All of management.” (G-SROG Separate Statement, p. 13:2.) That response
was sufficient because the request did not ask for more information. 
 
Accordingly, the request to compel further
response to G-SROG No. 97 is DENIED.
 
·      
G-SROG No. 98: Do YOU have in YOUR possession
or control any copy or partial copy of the PLAINTIFF’S client contact
information?
 
Guillen responded: “No.” (G-SROG Separate
Statement, p. 14:26.) That answer was sufficient.
 
Accordingly, the request to compel further

Guillen responded to the above requests as
follows: “Responding Party objects on the grounds that this interrogatory is
vague, ambiguous, overbroad, unduly burdensome, irrelevant, and not reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Furthermore,
Responding Party objects to this interrogatory as it calls for a legal
conclusion. Responding Party objects to Propounding Party’s interrogatory to
the extent that it calls for responses containing privileged, proprietary
and/or confidential business information or trade secrets. Such information
will not be provided. Responding Party further states this interrogatory is
meant for INDUSTRIAL LINE VOLTAGE LLC, not Jason Guillen as an individual. ¶ Discovery, investigation, analysis, and trial
preparation are ongoing; Responding Party reserves the right to supplement this
discovery response.” (G-SROG Separate Statement, pp. 46:16-25; 48:5-14;

Plaintiff states it “claims [presumably in the
Complaint] that Dan Sellers and Jesus “Jessie” Villareal coordinated with IHV’s
competitors to manipulate [Plaintiff] IHV’s bids.” (G-SROG Separate Statement,
p. 52:1-2.)
 
However, that allegation is not made in the

Villareal are or why the requests seek relevant information.
 
Therefore, the request to compel further
response to G-SROG Nos. 153-164 is DENIED.

SPECIAL

Plaintiff moves for an order compelling ILV to

INTERROGATORY 85.
·      
I-SROG No. 87: Please IDENTIFY each PERSON who

85.
 
The Court finds No. 85 seeks relevant
information because Plaintiff alleges that ILV advertised itself by lying and
saying that Plaintiff was out of business. (I-SROG Separate Statement, p.
4:4-5.) The Court also finds ILV’s objections to No. 85 unpersuasive. Nos. 86
and 87 concern No. 85.

responses to I-SROG Nos. 85-87 is GRANTED.

know how it differs from ILV’s) sufficient. Nos. 143 and 144 seek more

INTERROGATORY 148.
 
The Court finds Nos. 145 and 148 vague and,
therefore, the request to compel further responses to I-SROG Nos. 145-150 is
DENIED. 
 
·      
I-SROG No. 159: Why did YOU take a photograph,
seen in both Exhibits J and K, of your employee wearing fire retardant clothing
purchased by PLAINTIFF?
·      
I-SROG No. 160: What is the current location
of the fire retardant clothing worn by this worker in the photograph, seen in
both Exhibits J and K, on the INDUSTRIAL LINE VOLTAGE LLC website?
 
In response to Nos. 159 to 160, ILV responded
that the fire retardant clothing pictured in those exhibits were not purchased
by Plaintiff. That was a code-compliant response. 
 
Therefore, the request to compel further
responses to I-SROG Nos. 159-160 is DENIED. 
 
·      
I-SROG No. 161: If you contend INDUSTRIAL LINE
VOLTAGE LLC purchased the fire retardant clothing worn by the person in the
photograph, seen in both Exhibits J and K, identify the invoice so it can be
the subject of a document request.
 
Notwithstanding the Court’s ruling above
regarding Nos. 159-160, the Court finds the request seeks relevant information
given Plaintiff’s allegations that the defendants took its property and ILV’s
claim that the fire retardant shown in the exhibits were not Plaintiff’s. 
 
Therefore, the request to compel further
response to I-SROG No. 161 is GRANTED. 
 
REQUEST
FOR SANCTIONS
 
Plaintiff seeks sanctions of $4,725, which is
$1,181.25 per motion. (See Schwartz Decl., 10 [“IHV is charged $225 per hour of
my time and $280 per hour of the time of Craig C. Lang, Esq. of this office.
Mr. Lang spent a total of twelve (12) hours preparing the instant motions, the
separate statements and this declaration (12 x $280 = $3,360). I spent an
additional hour reviewing and finalizing the instant motions and supporting
pleadings ($225). I anticipate spending at least two hours (2 x $225 = $450)
reviewing any opposition to the instant motions and preparing any brief in
reply. The instant motions are scheduled to be heard on August 1 and August 8,
2024. I anticipate spending at least one hour at each hearing for a total of
two hours (2 x $225 = $450). Also, IHV was charged a $60 filing for each
motion, for a total of $240. Therefore, IHV is requesting that this Court enter
sanctions totaling $4,725 ($3,360 + $225 + $450 + $450 + $240) against Mr.
Guillen, ILV and their counsel of record, the Salek Law Firm. Divided among the
four instant motions, that amount comes to $1,181.25 per motion”].)
 
The Court finds it proper to impose sanctions
because Guillen and ILV did not serve code-compliant responses to a substantial
portion of the discovery at issue. 
 
Nevertheless, the Court finds the requested
sanctions excessive because no opposition or reply papers were filed. In
addition, the Court has denied several requests to compel further responses. 
 
Accordingly, the Court will only impose
sanctions of $1,181.25 per defendant (i.e., total sanctions of $2,362.50 for
all four (4) motions). 
 
Defendants are each ordered to pay Plaintiff
sanctions of $1,181.25.
