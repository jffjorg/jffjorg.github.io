Significant Statements:
  - "A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable."
  - "To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff's proof need not be alleged."
  - "A pleading is uncertain if it is ambiguous or unintelligible."
  - "Defendants argue that the complaint lacks specific facts regarding the nature and extent of Plaintiff's mental suffering; general claims of 'physical harm and ongoing emotional distress' without detailed descriptions are inadequate."
  - "The Court finds that the complaint does not sufficiently allege that the Defendants' conduct met the standard of being 'outrageous' as required for an IIED claim."
```

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the Complaint with leave to amend, dismissing the following causes of action:

1. Battery: The complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to satisfy the elements of battery, including intentional touching or control over the bedbugs that caused the plaintiff's injuries.
2. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED): The complaint lacks specific facts showing that Defendants' conduct was directed at Plaintiff with the intent to cause distress or that they acted with reckless disregard for Plaintiff's emotional well-being.
3. Fraudulent Concealment: The complaint fails to allege sufficient specific facts to state a cause of action for fraudulent concealment, including the exact timing of when Defendants became aware of the infestation, the specific employees or agents involved in the concealment, or the precise representations or omissions made to Plaintiff.
4. Private Nuisance: The complaint does not allege sufficient facts to satisfy a claim for private nuisance, as Plaintiff, as a hotel guest, does not have a sufficient property interest to support a private nuisance action.

The Court notes that the plaintiff's claims are based on the bedbug infestation at the hotel, but the complaint lacks specific details and fails to allege sufficient facts to support the legal elements of each cause of action. The Court grants leave to amend the complaint to address these deficiencies.
