ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On April 19, 2024, Plaintiff Red Target, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed an
action against Defendant Oscar Caceres dba Known Affiliates Event Group
(“Defendant”) and Does 1-10 alleging causes of action for Breach of Lease, Open
Book, and Account Stated. (Compl., p. 1.) Defendant, representing himself,
filed an Answer on June 5, 2024. 
 
On July 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Requests
be Deemed Admitted (“RFAs”), Documents Adjudicated Genuine, and Request for
Monetary Sanctions (the “Motion”). 
 
On September 17, 2024, the Court did not take action on
any pending motions, and the case was reassigned for all purposes to Department
25 at the Spring Street Courthouse. (9/17/24 Orders.) 
 
On September 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion
and associated documents again with the Court. Plaintiff also filed an
additional proof of service indicating Plaintiff served Defendant with the
updated Notice of Hearing and Proposed Order on September 24, 2024. (9/30/24 Proof
of Service.) 
 
No Opposition was filed.

Discussion

 
Request for Admissions 
 
A party must respond to requests for admissions within 30
days after service of such requests. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd. (a).)
“If a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely
response…(a) [that party] waives any objection to the requests, including one
based on privilege or on the protection for work product…” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (a).) “The requesting party may move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter
7.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) 

 
Here, Plaintiff contends that Defendant failed to timely
respond to its RFAs and documents on or by the statutory deadline. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd. (a).) Plaintiff’s counsel’s office served Defendant
with the RFAs and documents by mail on or about June 10, 2024. (Ferns Decl., ¶ 4,
Exh. 1, p. 5.) The deadline for Defendant to respond was July 24, 2024. 
 
As of the date this Motion was filed, July 26, 2024,
Plaintiff had not received any responses. (Ferns, Decl., ¶ 8.) Plaintiff also
states that as of September 24, 2024, Plaintiff had not received any responses.
(Motion, p. 3.)
 
Thus, Plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming RFAs and
genuineness of documents admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)
 
Sanctions
 
Sanctions are mandatory against the
party, the attorney, or both whose failure to serve a timely response to the
request necessitated the motion to deem request for admissions as admitted. (See
Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2033.250(a), 2033.280(c); see also Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1348(a) [the court can award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor
of a party seeking to compel discovery even though no opposition was filed, the
opposition was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving
party after the motion was filed].)
 
Here, Defendant failed to serve a timely response to
Plaintiff’s RFAs and documents by the statutory deadline. Thus, sanctions are
mandatory against Defendant, “whose failure to serve a timely response
to the request necessitated the motion to deem request for admissions as
admitted. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2033.250(a), 2033.280(c); see also Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a).)
 
Plaintiff requests monetary
sanctions of $900, reflecting costs incurred on the Motion at an hourly rate of
$350.00 per hour (1.9 hours preparing the Motion and .5 hours attending the
Motion hearing), plus $60 in filing fees. (Motion, Ferns Decl., ¶ 10.)
 
Given the straightforward nature of
the motion, Plaintiff’s request for sanctions against Defendant is GRANTED in
the reduced amount of $410. 
 
III.
