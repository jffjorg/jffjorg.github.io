Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's unopposed motion to deem the request for admissions and genuineness of documents admitted. The plaintiff had served the defendant with the requests for admissions and documents on or about June 10, 2024, but the defendant failed to respond by the statutory deadline. As a result, the plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the requests for admissions and genuineness of documents admitted.

The judge also grants the plaintiff's unopposed request for monetary sanctions against the defendant in the reduced amount of $410. The plaintiff had requested $900 in sanctions, but the judge reduced the amount based on the straightforward nature of the motion.

The judge orders the defendant to pay the sanctions to the plaintiff within 30 days of the order.
