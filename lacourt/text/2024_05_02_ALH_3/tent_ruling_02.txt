      CASE NO.: 22ahcv00114
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL DISCOVERY RESPONSES FROM DEFENDANT
   WELCH LAW FIRM
 
Dept.
  3
8:30
  a.m.
May 2,
   2024



 
On January 24, 2024, plaintiff Violeta
Martin (“Plaintiff”) filed this motion for an order compelling defendant Welch
Law Firm (“Defendant”) to provide verified responses to Request for Production,
Set One and Request for Form Interrogatories, Set One. This motion, which
should have been brought as two motions, was originally scheduled to be heard
on April 25, 2024. On April 15, 2024, the Court continued the hearing to May 2,
2024, and ordered Plaintiff to give notice of the new hearing date. On April
17, 2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of hearing informing the parties that the
hearing had been rescheduled for “March 2, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.” Therefore, not
only did Plaintiff fail to pay two filing fees as required, Plaintiff also
failed to give Defendant notice of the correct hearing date. 
Last, the discovery directed to
Defendant was served on Chris Prussak, who recently admitted that he had not
been retained by Defendant. Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendant was not
served with the requests and DENIES Plaintiff’s motion. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
 
Dated
this 1st
day of May 2024
