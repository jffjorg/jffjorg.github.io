Plaintiff Energy Sanrio Investment LLC
(“Plaintiff”) requests a default judgment against defendants A1 Ent Inc. and K
Music Entertainment Inc. Plaintiff states that it loaned each defendant
$125,000 and that each defendant still owes him $50,000. Plaintiff approximates
prejudgment interest to be “at least $20,000” at a rate of 10% per annum but
does not include any explanation for how this amount was calculated. (CRC
3.1800 [requiring “[i]nterest computations as necessary” for default judgment
on declarations].) Also, the proposed judgment filed on March 25, 2024, does
not identify the amount each defendant is liable for or specify whether
liability is joint and/or several. 
The hearing is continued to June 7, 2024,
at 8:30 a.m. in Department 3 of the Alhambra Courthouse. A new proposed
judgment and a declaration including a computation of prejudgment interest must
be submitted no later than 5 court days before the date of the hearing. 
 
Dated
this 2nd
day of May, 2024
