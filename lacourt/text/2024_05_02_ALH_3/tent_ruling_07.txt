On December 5, 2023, plaintiff County
of Los Angeles (“Plaintiff”) filed this action for quiet title, slander of
title, and declaratory relief relating to property located at 2261 N. Lincoln
Avenue in Altadena, California (the “Property”). The Complaint named C.R.
Legal, Sr., House of Prayer International, and all persons unknown, claiming
any legal or equitable right, title, estate, lien, or interests in the property
adverse to Plaintiff’s title, or any cloud on Plaintiff’s title to the Property
(“Unknown Persons”). 
On March 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
application requesting an order authorizing service by publication on “Unknown
Persons.” The application was granted on March 14, 2024. Plaintiff proceeded to
publish copies of the summons and complaint in the L.A. Times on March 21,
March 28, April 4, and April 11, 2024. A copy of the summons and complaint was
also posted at the property. On April 3, 2024, Mooya Assasepa (“Defendant”)
filed this motion to quash service of summons. Defendant argues that service of
the summons and complaint must be quashed because Plaintiff did not personally
serve them. 
California Code of Civil Procedure
section 418.10 provides the exclusive procedure for challenging personal
jurisdiction at the outset. (Roy v. Superior Court (2005) 127
Cal.App.4th 337, 342.) Although the defendant is the moving party, the burden
of proof is on the plaintiff to defeat the motion by establishing that
jurisdictional grounds exist. (Mihlon v. Superior Court (1985) 169
Cal.App.3d 703, 710.)
Service by publication is one of the
methods for serving a summons and is strictly construed. (Code Civ. Proc. § 415.50;
County of Riverside v. Superior Court (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 443, 450.) To
serve by publication, the plaintiff must exercise “reasonable diligence to
locate a person in order to give him notice before resorting to the fictional
notice afforded by publication.”  (Donel,
Inc. v. Badalian (1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 327, 332.) Service by publication
should be used only as a last resort. (Watts v. Crawford (1995) 10
Cal.4th 743, 749, fn. 5.) If the defendant’s address is ascertainable, then
some other method of service must be used. (Ibid.) 
Plaintiff’s counsel, Erin A. Shields,
declares that her firm ordered a litigation guarantee with respect to the
Property from Lawyer’s Title Company, but the guarantee did not name anyone
other than C.R. Legal, Sr. and House of Prayer International who might assert
an interest in the Property. (Shields Decl. ¶¶ 1-5.) Shields also declares that
she spoke to counsel for House of Prayer International and the process server
spoke with C.R. Legal, Sr., but neither of them spoke of any other person who
might claim an interest in the Property. Therefore, the service by publication
on Defendant as an “Unknown Defendant” was effective because Defendant’s
address was not ascertainable in any other fashion and Plaintiff was not
required to personally serve Defendant. 
In light of the foregoing, the motion
to quash is DENIED. Because the instant motion is only a motion to quash, the
Court does not address Defendant’s argument that the “Declaration of Land
Patent” published in the Pasadena Weekly in March 2011 defeats Plaintiff’s
claims to title.
