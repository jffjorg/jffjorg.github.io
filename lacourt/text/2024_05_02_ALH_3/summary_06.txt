And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further discovery responses filed by defendant FCA US LLC. The defendant sought to compel plaintiffs Silvestre Cosio and Cynthia Zambrano to provide additional responses to certain discovery requests. The plaintiffs had previously objected to the requests on various grounds, including that they were vague, ambiguous, and sought sensitive information. The defendant also requested sanctions in the amount of $1,750, which the judge denied due to a lack of supporting documentation. The judge also noted that the defendant's request for sanctions was not supported by any explanation of how the requested amount was calculated. The judge further noted that the defendant should have filed two separate motions and paid two separate filing fees, as they were requesting orders compelling two separate sets of further responses, one for each plaintiff. As a result, the judge denied the defendant's request for sanctions and indicated that any monetary sanctions would be conditioned on the defendant paying an additional filing fee and filing proof of payment with the court.
