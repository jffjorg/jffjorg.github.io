And here is the English-text summary:

Judge Crowfoot's tentative ruling denies the motion of Mooya Assasepa to quash the service of summons. The defendant argues that the service was ineffective because the plaintiff did not personally serve them. The plaintiff, County of Los Angeles, filed a complaint for quiet title, slander of title, and declaratory relief, and used service by publication to serve the defendant. The court finds that the service was effective because the defendant's address was not ascertainable in any other fashion and the plaintiff was not required to personally serve the defendant. The court does not address the defendant's argument that a "Declaration of Land Patent" published in the Pasadena Weekly in March 2011 defeats the plaintiff's claims to title. The court sets a hearing for May 2, 2024, and invites parties who intend to submit on the tentative to send an email to the court.
