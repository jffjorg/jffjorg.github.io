And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Gosdom's motion to compel compliance with its Requests for Production of Documents (RFP) Nos. 2 and 11. Gosdom had sought production of documents from Deng, alleging that Deng had misappropriated funds and made false representations. Deng produced some documents, but Gosdom argued that the production was incomplete and that certain emails and written messages were missing. The court disagreed with Gosdom's assertions and found that the produced documents, including a receipt and a wire transfer request, could be interpreted as communications between Deng and Guo. The court also denied Gosdom's request for sanctions against Deng.
