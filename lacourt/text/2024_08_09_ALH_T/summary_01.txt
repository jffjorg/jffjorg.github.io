And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the Defendant's Motion to Compel Deposition of Plaintiff is GRANTED. The Defendant had properly served the Plaintiff with a Notice of Taking of Deposition and made sufficient efforts to meet and confer with the Plaintiff. The Defendant was not served with the notice of deposition, and therefore, is not precluded from taking the Plaintiff's deposition under Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.610(a). The judge also agrees with the Defendant that she would be prejudiced in her ability to prepare for trial without taking the Plaintiff's deposition. The Plaintiff's issue preclusion and estoppel arguments are not applicable, and the judge therefore grants the Defendant's motion.
