Summary in English:

The Tentative Ruling is a summary of the Judge's thoughts on the case before the hearing. The Judge has ruled that the Defendant's demurrer to the First Amended Complaint is overruled, and the Defendant's motion to strike is denied. The Judge has also ordered the Defendant to file an Answer to the FAC within 21 days of the ruling and the Plaintiff to give notice.

The demurrer was filed by the Defendant to challenge the sufficiency of the Plaintiff's allegations, but the Judge found that the Plaintiff's allegations were sufficient to state a cause of action. The Judge also found that the Defendant's motion to strike the request for punitive damages was without merit, as the Plaintiff's allegations of fraud, oppression, or malice were sufficient to support an award of punitive damages.

The Judge has also made significant findings regarding the doctrine of respondeat superior and the theory of ratification, finding that the Defendant On-Line Power was vicariously liable for the acts of its employee, Defendant Reyes, and that the Defendant's owner, Abbie Gougerchian, ratified Defendant Reyes' misconduct by keeping him employed despite knowledge of his misconduct.
