Tentative
Ruling:      The Motion for Attorney’s
Fees and Costs is granted in the amount of  $23,113.30. 
 

 
This is a Song-Beverly action. On
January 26, 2022, Plaintiff Gina Harris (Plaintiff) filed suit against
Defendant General Motors, LLC (Defendant). Plaintiff alleged that on July 28,
2014, she entered into a warranty contract for a 2014 Chevrolet Impala, which
was manufactured and distributed by Defendant. Plaintiff also alleged that after
she received the vehicle it had a series of defects and nonconformities to the
battery and engine. Plaintiff asserted claims under the Song-Beverly Act, as
well as for breach of warranty.
 
On May 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
notice of settlement. 
 
On July 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
motion for attorneys’ fees. In the settlement, Defendant stipulated to
Plaintiff being the prevailing party for the purpose of the motion for
attorneys’ fees and costs. 
 
Defendant does not oppose the
motion.
 
Evidentiary Issues
 
Plaintiff’s request for judicial
notice of Exhibits 1-19 is denied. 
 
Legal Standard
 
A
prevailing plaintiff in a Song-Beverly Act case is entitled to “recover as part
of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses,
including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined by the
Court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the
commencement and prosecution of such action.”¿¿(Civ. Code, § 1794,¿subd. (d).) “As
the plain wording of section 1794, subdivision (d) makes clear, the trial court
is ‘to base the fee award upon actual time expended on the case, as long as
such fees are reasonably incurred—both from the standpoint of time spent and
the amount charged.’ [Citation.] In the case of contingency fee arrangements, ‘a
prevailing buyer ... is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees for
time reasonably expended by his or her attorneys.’” (Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of
N. Am., LLC (2020) 48 Cal. App. 5th 240, 247.)
 
The
prevailing party has the burden of showing that the requested attorney fees
were “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation and were reasonable
in amount.” (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California Inc.¿(2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 785, 817.) The party seeking attorney fees “‘is not necessarily
entitled to compensation for the value of attorney services according to [his]
own notion or to the full extent claimed by [him].’” (Levy v. Toyota Motor
Sales, USA, Inc.¿(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 807, 816.)¿¿Therefore, if the “time
expended or the monetary charge being made for the time expended are not
reasonable under all the circumstances, then the court must take this into
account and award attorney fees in a lesser amount.” (Nightingale v. Hyundai
Motor America¿(1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.)¿¿  
 
A court may
“reduce a fee award based on its reasonable determination that a routine,
noncomplex case was overstaffed to a degree that significant inefficiencies and
inflated fees resulted.”¿¿(Morris v. Hyundai Motor America¿(2019) 41
Cal.App.5th 24, 39.)¿¿It is also appropriate to reduce an award based on
inefficient or duplicative efforts. (Id.¿at p. 38.) However, the
analysis must be “reasonably specific” and cannot rely on general notions of
fairness. (Kerkeles¿v. City of San Jose¿(2015) 243 Cal.App.4th
88,¿102.)¿¿Moreover, in conducting the analysis, courts are not permitted to
tie any reductions in the fee award to some proportion of the buyer’s damages
recovery. (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc.¿(2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24,
39.) 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff seeks $36,647.85 in
attorneys’ fees comprised of (i) a lodestar of $27,058.00, (ii) a multiplier of
1.35 of $8,245.30, (iii) anticipated fees for the reply and hearing on the
motion of $3,500.00, and (iv) costs of $1,344.55. 
 
Attorneys’ Fees
 
A calculation of attorneys’ fees
for a Song-Beverly action begins with the “lodestar” approach, under which
the court fixes the lodestar at “the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (Margolin v. Regional
Planning Com. (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004-1005; see also Press
v. Lucky Stores, Inc. (1983) 34 Cal.3d 311, 322 [“‘starting point of every
fee award … must be a calculation of the attorney’s services in terms of the
time he has expended on the case.’”].) “California courts have consistently
held that a computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of
that time is fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys’ fee
award.” (Ibid.) “‘The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in
the community for similar work.’” (Id. at p. 1004.) The
lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors
specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the
legal services provided. (Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d
25, 49; PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084,
1095.) 
 
“[T]rial courts need not, and
indeed should not, become green-eyeshade accountants. The essential goal in
shifting fees (to either party) is to do rough justice, not to achieve auditing
perfection. So, trial courts may take into account their overall sense of a
suit, and may use estimates in calculating and allocating an attorney’s time.”
(Fox v. Vice (2011) 563 U.S. 826, 838.)
 
Here, the court has considered the
declarations of Payam Shahian and Angel M. Baker submitted in support of the
motion, along with the other papers filed in support the motion. With respect
to the hours billed by counsel, the court concludes that some reduction of both
hours and billing rates is warranted.
 
Hourly Rates
 
In assessing the reasonableness of
hourly billing rates,¿“the court may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity
with the legal market, as well as the experience, skill, and reputation of the
attorney requesting fees [citation], the difficulty or complexity of the
litigation to which that skill was applied [citations], and affidavits from
other attorneys regarding prevailing fees in the community and rate
determinations in other cases.”¿¿(569 East County Boulevard LLC v.
Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc.¿(2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 437; see¿Mountjoy
v. Bank of America, N.A.¿(2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 266, 272 [“‘a reasonable
hourly rate is the product of a multiplicity of factors…[including] the level
of skill necessary, time limitations, the amount to be obtained in the
litigation, the attorney’s reputation, and the undesirability of the case’”].)¿
 
Plaintiff’s attorneys’ time records
reflect hourly rates ranging from $295 to $595. 
 
With respect to billing rates, the
court reduces Angel Baker, James Carroll, Jami Littles, and Ian McCallister’s
hourly rates down to $575. These individuals have extensive experience in the
legal field and have all been licensed at least fifteen years. Nevertheless,
the court finds that a rate above $575 per hour is beyond reasonable for this
region and this area of the law and thus reduces their hourly rates.
 
The court also reduces the rate of Tionna
Carvalho’s work to $525. Ms. Carvalho passed the bar in 2014. While she is now
a partner, the court concludes that $570 or $595, based on Ms. Carvalho’s nine
years of experience, is unreasonable. In so concluding, the court notes the
hourly rate of Mr. McCallister, barred in 1998. 
 
The court also reduces the rate of
Robiya Tirmizi’s work to $375. Ms. Tirmizi passed the bar in 2021. While Ms.
Tirmizi has practiced for three years, the court concludes that $395, based on
Ms. Tirmizi’s experience, is unreasonable. In so concluding, the court notes
the hourly rate of Ms. Theophil, barred in 2022.
 
The approved rates are as follows:

Reasonableness of Expenditures
 
The court does not find that, for a
Song-Beverly Act case, Plaintiff’s counsel overstaffed it. The court’s inquiry
is whether expenditures were unreasonable because they were duplicative or
unnecessary. Certain entries that reflect issues arising from block billing are
reduced, also discussed below. The court makes the following adjustments to the
hours for which Plaintiff seeks compensation:

Multiplier 
 
Plaintiff requests a 1.35
multiplier.
 
Relevant factors to determine
whether an enhancement is appropriate include: (1) the novelty and difficulty
of the questions involved; (2) the skill displayed in presenting them; (3) the
extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys; and (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1132.)  
 
“‘The purpose of such adjustment is
to fix a fee at the fair market value for the particular action. In effect, the
court determines, retrospectively, whether the litigation involved a contingent
risk or required extraordinary legal skill justifying augmentation of the
unadorned lodestar in order to approximate the fair market rate for such
services.’” (Santana v. FCA US, LLC (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 334, 351,
quoting Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at p. 1132.) “Perhaps the most common
multiplier applied, at least where a plaintiff prevails, is a modifier for the
contingent nature of the representation.” (Ibid.)
 
Another factor considered by courts
in applying a multiplier is the “result obtained.” “The ‘results obtained’
factor can properly be used to enhance a lodestar calculation where an
exceptional effort produced an exceptional benefit.” (Graham v.
DaimlerChrysler Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 553, 582.) “The purpose of such
adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair market value for the particular action.
In effect, the court determines, retrospectively, whether the litigation
involved a contingent risk or required extraordinary legal skill justifying
augmentation of the unadorned lodestar in order to approximate the fair market
rate for such services.” (Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92
Cal.App.4th 819, 833.)
 
Here, Plaintiff argues its work
justifies a multiplier. The court disagrees. While counsel did obtain a good
result, the case was like many of counsel’s cases. The case did not present
novel issues or questions of law. Nor was the case of such a substantial size
that it would have precluded counsel from other work. Based on the Baker
declaration, the parties mainly engaged in written discovery, with motions
practice confined entirely to eight motions in limine. (Declaration of Angel M.
Baker, ¶¶ 10-36, 39-40.) The case did not have any dispositive motions such as
a demurrer or motion for summary judgment. The case settled when Plaintiff
accepted Defendant’s 998 offer. This case, while a contingency, did not present
a greater or more severe risk than other Song-Beverly Act cases in counsel’s
practice.
 
The court concludes that enhancing
the lodestar with a multiplier is unwarranted.
 
Costs and Expenses
 
“A prevailing party who claims
costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs within 15 days after the
date of service of the notice of entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk .
. . The memorandum of costs must be verified by a statement of the party,
attorney, or agent that to the best of his or her knowledge the items of cost
are correct and were necessarily incurred in the case.” (Rules of Court, Rule
3.1700, subd. (a) (1) [emphasis added].) 
 
Under the law, the court presumes a
verified memorandum of costs is correct. However, a party may contest the costs
that a prevailing party seeks. (Code Civ. Proc., §1034 subd. (a).) The
challenging party has the burden of demonstrating that those costs are
unreasonable or unnecessary. (Adams v. Ford Motor Co. (2011) 199
Cal.App.4th 1475, 1486 
 
Here, Plaintiff seeks a total
$1,344.55 in costs. (Declaration of Payam Shahian, Exhibit 20 “SLP Cost and
Expenses” pp. 2-3.) Defendant does not oppose. 
 
Accordingly, the court grants Plaintiff’s
request for costs totaling $1,344.55.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant is ordered to pay to
Plaintiff’s attorneys, Strategic Legal Practices, APC, attorneys’ fees and
costs, in the sum of $23,113.30, on or before November 6, 2024.
