And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in the case of Gina Harris v. General Motors, LLC, granting the plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees and costs in the amount of $23,113.30. The motion was filed on July 11, 2024, and the hearing was held on October 7, 2024. The plaintiff sought to recover attorneys' fees and costs under the Song-Beverly Act, alleging that the defendant manufactured and distributed a defective vehicle.

The judge found that the plaintiff was entitled to recover attorneys' fees and costs, but reduced the lodestar amount from $27,058.00 to $21,058.75. The judge also concluded that enhancing the lodestar with a multiplier was unwarranted.

The judge's tentative ruling does not address the reasonableness of the attorneys' fees and costs, but rather grants the motion as requested. The defendant does not oppose the motion, and the plaintiff seeks to recover the amount of $23,113.30. The judge's ruling is subject to further review and may be modified or reversed at a later date.
