And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is reconsidering her previous ruling that granted the defendant's motion to have its answer stricken and default entered against it. The court has decided to vacate its previous ruling and deny the motion. The court will instead schedule a jury trial forthwith. The court's decision is based on four factors: the defendant provided no authority supporting its request to withdraw its answer and seek default; case law indicates that an unopposed jury trial is the proper remedy for the failure of a defendant to appear at trial; none of the grounds for waiver of a jury trial would have been satisfied under these circumstances; and imposition of default could potentially limit the plaintiff's recovery in ways that would not be applicable at trial. The court finds that the defendant's opposition fails to address these points and instead merely reasserts its position that the court has the inherent authority to strike the answer and enter default.
