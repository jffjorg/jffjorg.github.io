And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by Defendant Bank of America, N.A. should be sustained in its entirety. The demurrer argues that the claims brought by Plaintiffs Rokit World, Inc. and Jonathan Kendrick are barred by the litigation privilege because the alleged improper disclosures occurred in the course of a judicial proceeding. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs have failed to allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action, and that the claims are indeed barred by the litigation privilege. The Court also notes that the Plaintiffs failed to oppose the demurrer, which is taken as a tacit admission that the Defendant's arguments are meritorious. As a result, the Court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the Plaintiffs will not be able to re-file their complaint. This is the third time that the Plaintiffs have attempted to bring a claim that is not barred by the litigation privilege, and the Court finds that they have demonstrated an inability to do so.
