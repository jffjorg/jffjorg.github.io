BACKGROUND
            This action arises from an alleged
breach of a construction contract. On April 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
operative first amended complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants asserting the following
causes of action: (1) breach of written contract; (2) breach of implied
warranty; (3) for money paid; (4) open book account; (5) unjust enrichment; (6)
negligence; (7) intentional misrepresentation; (8) false promises; (9)
fraudulent suppression of material fact; (10) disgorgement – violation of
Business & Professions Code §§ 7031, et seq.; (11) unfair competition and
business practices – Business & Professions Code § 17200; (12) declaratory
relief; and (13) action on contractor’s license board.       
             
On November 5, 2024, Defendant Ben Amin Assil,
individually and d/b/a Biltmore Inc. d/b/a Buildmore Construction &
Remodeling, Biltmore, Inc. (“Assil”) filed a first amended cross-complaint (“FAXC”)
asserting the following causes of action: (1) breach of contract; (2) open book
account; (3) negligence; (4) intentional misrepresentation; (5) unjust
enrichment; (6) violation of Business and Professions Code § 17200 et seq.; (7)
retaliation; and (8) injunctive relief.
 
On September 16, 2024, Plaintiff moved for
an order compelling responses to form interrogatories (“FIs”), for an order
compelling responses to request for production of documents (“RFPs”) and for an
order establishing admissions (“RFAs”). On December 3, 2024, the motions came on
for hearing. The Court granted Plaintiff’s motions to compel responses to FIs
and RFPs, but pursuant to the request of the Defendant, continued the hearing
on the instant motion to deem RFAs admitted (the “Motion”). As of the date of
the continued hearing, no opposition has been filed, and the Court has not been
informed that responses to the RFAs have been served.
 
DISCUSSION
A discovering party can make a motion to
deem as admitted any unanswered requests for admission or any requests answered
in a late or unverified response. (Code Civil Procedure (“CCP”), § 2033.280,
subd. (b); CCP, § 2033.240, subd. (a) [RFA responses must be signed by
responding party under oath]; Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206
Cal.App.3d 632, 636 [unsworn response to RFAs is treated like no response].)
These requests are not automatically deemed admitted; the discovering party
must make the motion. (CCP, § 2033.280, subd. (b).)
 
To establish this ground, a movant must
show:
(1) Proper service (CCP, § 2033.070);
(2) Expiration of the deadline for the
initial response 30 days after service or on date agreed to by parties (CCP, §
2033.250, subds. (a), (b)); and
(3) That (a) the responding party served
no response (CCP, § 2033.280, subd. (b)), (b) the propounding party served a
late response (CCP, § 2033.280, subd. (b)); or (3) the responding party served
an unsworn response. (Appleton, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at 636).
 
A court must deny a motion to compel
initial discovery where the discovery sought is outside the scope of discovery.
(CBS, Inc. v. Superior Court (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12, 19; CCP, §
2017.010 [scope of discovery].) 
 
The discovery was served via mail and electronic
mail on Assil on August 2, 2024. (Mot., Omrani Decl., ¶ 6, Exs. A-B [Proof of
Service].) The deadline to respond was 30 days after service, plus five days
for service via mail. (CCP, § 1013 subd. (a).) Thus, responses were due on September
7, 2024. As of the date of the hearing on this Motion, there is no evidence
before the Court that Assil has responded to the RFAs.  
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admissions Admitted is
GRANTED. 
 
Request for Sanctions
The Court must award sanctions when a
party’s response to request for admissions is untimely, and the discovering
party makes a motion to deem the requests admitted. (CCP, § 2033.280, subd.
(c); Appleton, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at 635-636 [sanctions are
mandatory].)
 
The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed. (Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
 
Plaintiff
requests sanctions against Assil in the total amount of $1,263.52 based upon
counsel’s rate of $475.00/hour for: (1) 1.0 hour meeting and conferring,
researching, preparing, and filing the Motion and accompanying documents; (2)
0.75 hours reviewing the opposition and preparing a reply; (3) 0.75 hours for
the hearing on the Motion; and (4) filing fees of $76.02. A reduction is
appropriate here because no opposition was filed, an argument more than 0.5
hours is unlikely, this Motion is duplicative of the prior motions to compel,
and the actual Court filing fee is $60.00. Thus, the request for sanctions is
GRANTED in the reduced amount of $535.00. 
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem Requests for
Admissions Admitted is GRANTED. The admissions are deemed ADMITTED as truth. 
Assil is ordered to remit sanctions to
Plaintiff in the amount of $535.00 within twenty days of the date of this
order. 
 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
