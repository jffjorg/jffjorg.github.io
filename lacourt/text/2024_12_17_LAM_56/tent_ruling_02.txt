  CASE NO.:  24STCV15533
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
DEMURRER
 
Date: December 17, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 
 



 
MOVING
PARTY:  Defendants Yummy Donuts, Inc. and
Lim Horn Ouk (erroneously sued as Jimhorn Book Kwok) (collectively,
“Defendants”)
RESPONDING PARTY: None
 
            On June 21, 2024, Plaintiff Rodrigo
Galicia Rivas (“Plaintiff”) filed the original complaint (the “Complaint”) in
this action. Defendants filed the instant demurrer (the “Demurrer”) on
September 4, 2024. On December 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint (the “FAC”). Proof of service indicates that the FAC was served on
Defendants on December 4, 2024 via email. 
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”)
section 472, subdivision (a), Plaintiff was entitled to, as a matter of right,
file a first amended complaint as of December 4, 2024, nine court days prior to
this hearing. Plaintiff filed the FAC on December 4, 2024. Thus, Plaintiff’s
filing of the FAC renders the subject demurrer moot. (CCP § 472 subd. (a); JKC3H8
v. Colton (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 468, 477.)
 
            Defendants' Demurrer to the Complaint
is MOOT.  
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
Dated this 17th day of December 2024
