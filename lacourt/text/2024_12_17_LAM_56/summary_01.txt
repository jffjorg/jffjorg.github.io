And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel responses to request for production of documents and a motion to deem requests for admissions admitted. The plaintiff, Durand Anderson, filed a complaint against the defendant, Thelma Williams, alleging causes of action for breach of warranty of habitability, negligent maintenance of premises, nuisance, breach of quiet enjoyment, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The defendant filed the motions on October 3, 2024, and the plaintiff opposed them on December 3, 2024.

The judge finds that the defendant's response to the discovery requests was untimely and unexplained, and therefore sanctions are warranted. The judge grants the motions in part and orders the defendant to pay a total amount of sanctions to the plaintiff in the amount of $1,470.00 within twenty days of the date of this order. The judge also orders that the defendant is to give notice of this ruling.
