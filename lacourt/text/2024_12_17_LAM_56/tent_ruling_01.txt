MOVING PARTY:  Defendant Thelma Williams (“Defendant”) 
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
Durand Anderson (“Plaintiff”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving and
opposition papers. No reply has been filed. 
 
BACKGROUND
            This is a habitability action. On February
10, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative complaint (the “Complaint”) against
Defendant Thelma Williams (“Defendant”), and Does 1 to 10, alleging causes of
action for: (1) breach of warranty of habitability; (2) negligent maintenance
of premises; (3) nuisance; (4) breach of quiet enjoyment; and (5) intentional
infliction of emotional distress.  
 
            On October 3, 2024, Defendant filed
a motion to compel responses to request for production of documents (“RFPs”)
and a motion to deem requests for admissions admitted (“RFAs”) (collectively,
the “Motions”). Both Motions include requests for monetary sanctions. 
 
On December 3, 2024, Plaintiff opposed
both Motions. 
 
DISCUSSION
A motion to compel an initial response can
be made on the ground that a party did not serve a timely response to interrogatories
or a demand to produce. (Code Civil Procedure “CCP”) §§ 2030.290, subd. (a)
[interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (a) [demand to produce]; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 404.)  The discovering
party can also make a motion to deem as admitted any unanswered requests for
admission or any requests answered in a late or unverified response. (CCP §
2033.280, subd. (b); CCP, § 2033.240, subd. (a) [RFA responses must be signed
by responding party under oath]; Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206
Cal.App.3d 632, 636 [unsworn response to RFAs is treated like no response].)
These requests are not automatically deemed admitted; the discovering party
must make the motion. (CCP § 2033.280, subd. (b).)
 
To establish this ground, a movant must
show:
(1) Proper service (CCP §§ 2030.080, subd.
(a) [interrogatories], 2031.040 [demand to produce]); § 2033.070 [requests for
admission])
(2) Expiration of the deadline for the
initial response 30 days after service or on date agreed to by parties (CCP §§
2030.260, subds. (a), (b) [interrogatories], 2031.260, subds. (a), (b) [demand
to produce] 2033.250, subds. (a), (b) [requests for admission]); and
(3) No timely response. (CCP §§ 2030.290
[interrogatories], 2031.300 [demand to produce] § 2033.280, subd. (b) [requests
for admission])
 
A court must deny a motion to compel
initial discovery where the discovery sought is outside the scope of discovery.
(CBS, Inc. v. Superior Court (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12, 19; CCP §
2017.010 [scope of discovery].)
 
            The RFPs and RFAs were served via
electronic service on July 17, 2024. (Both Mots, Sales Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. A [discovery
requests and proof of service].) The deadline to respond was 30 days after
service, plus two court days for electronic service. (CCP § 1010.6 subd. (a)(3)(B))
Thus responses to the RFPs and RFAs were due on August 20, 2024. Plaintiff states
that, as of the date of the filing of this Motion, Defendant has not responded
to the discovery requests. (Both Mots., Sales Decl., ¶ 6.) 
 
            In the opposition, Defendant argues
that the Motions and sanctions requests should be denied because she served Code-complaint
response to both the RFPs and RFAs on December 3, 2024. (Both Opps., Oronsaye
Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. 1.) 
 
Request for
Sanctions 
The Court must impose monetary sanctions
against anyone—party, nonparty, or attorney—who unsuccessfully makes or opposes
the motion, unless it finds that the person to be sanctioned acted with
substantial justification or other circumstances make the imposition of the
sanctions unjust. (CCP §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) [interrogatories], 2031.300,
subd. (c) [demand to produce]; Sinaiko, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at
404 [interrogatories and demand to produce].)
 
The Court must award sanctions when a
party’s response to request for admissions is untimely, and the discovering
party makes a motion to deem the requests admitted. (CCP, § 2033.280, subd.
(c); Appleton, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at 635-636 [sanctions are
mandatory].)
 
The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed. (Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
 
Even after a party provides discovery
responses, a party can keep its motion on calendar and the court has authority
to grant sanctions, even if it denies the motion to compel responses “as
essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part.” (Sinaiko, supra, 148
Cal.App.4th at 409.)
 
            The Court finds that, although
Defendant has since responded to the discovery requests, sanctions are
warranted due to Defendant’s unexplained dilatory response. Defendant has failed
to provide any justification for serving the discovery responses three months
after the deadline. Furthermore, sanctions are mandatory for an untimely
response to RFAs. (CCP, § 2033.280, subd. (c); Appleton, supra,
206 Cal.App.3d at 635-636 [sanctions are mandatory].) 
 
Plaintiff requests sanctions for the motion
to compel responses to RFPs against Defendant in the total amount of $751.00
based upon counsel’s rate of $450/hour for: (1) 1.0 hour researching and
preparing the Motion and accompanying documents; (2) 1.0 hour to review the
opposition and prepare a reply; (3) 0.5 hours to attend the hearing on this
matter; and (4) $76.00 in filing fees. (Both Mots., Sales Decl. ¶ 7.) As no
reply was filed and the Court filing fees are only $60.00, a reduction of 0.5
hours plus the $16.00 filing fee difference is appropriate.  Thus, the request for sanctions is GRANTED in
the reduced amount of $735.00.

of sanctions to Plaintiff in the amount of $1,470.00 within twenty days of the
date of this order.

Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
