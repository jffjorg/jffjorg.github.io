And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to the defendants' demurrer, which was filed on September 4, 2024. The plaintiff, Rodrigo Galicia Rivas, filed the original complaint on June 21, 2024, and the defendants filed the demurrer in response. However, on December 4, 2024, the plaintiff filed a first amended complaint, which was served on the defendants via email on the same day. The judge has determined that, under Code of Civil Procedure section 472, the plaintiff was entitled to file a first amended complaint as of December 4, 2024, and that the filing of the first amended complaint renders the demurrer moot. Therefore, the judge has granted the demurrer, but only to the extent that it is moot. The judge has ordered the defendants to give notice of this ruling.
