MOVING PARTY:  Defendant Bank of America, N.A. (“Defendant”) 
RESPONDING PARTY: None

 
            The Court has considered the moving papers.
No opposition papers were filed. Any opposition papers were required to have
been filed and served at least nine court days before the hearing under
California Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
BACKGROUND
             Plaintiffs Rokit World, Inc. and Jonathan
Kendrick (collectively “Plaintiffs”) commenced this action on October 13, 2023.
On June 3, 2024 Plaintiffs filed the operative second amended complaint (the
“SAC”) against Defendant asserting causes of action for: (1) breach of implied
contract of confidentiality and (2) violation of California financial
information privacy act (§§ 4052.5, 4053, and 4054). 
 
            On July 3, 2024, Defendant filed the
instant demurrer (“Demurrer”) to the SAC. The Demurrer is unopposed. 
 
MEET AND CONFER 
             Defendant has satisfied the meet and
confer requirement. (Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) § 430.41; Kenney Decl. ¶
2.) 
 
DISCUSSION
            A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; CCP § 430.10, subd. (e).) 
 
To sufficiently allege a cause of action,
a complaint must allege all the ultimate facts—that is, the facts needed to
establish each element of the cause of action pleaded. (Committee on
Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197,
212, superseded by statute as stated in Branick v. Downey Savings & Loan
Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) “[E]ach evidentiary fact that might
eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v.
William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) 
 
In testing the sufficiency of the cause of
action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry
v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) Courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept.
of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other
grounds, Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th
1158, 1162.) A demurrer, however, “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d
695, 713.)  
 
            Defendant first demur sto the entire
SAC on the ground that the claims are barred by the litigation privilege.  
 
Litigation
Privilege
            California law does not permit
liability for communications relating to lawsuits, except in the case of
malicious prosecution. (Civil Code, § 47.) The litigation privilege applies to
any communication: (1) made in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by
litigants or other participants authorized by law; (3) to achieve the
objectives of the litigation; and (4) that have some reasonable relevancy to
the subject matter of the action. (Silberg v. Anderson (1990) 50 Cal. 3d
205, 212.) “It is also well settled that the absolute privilege … extends to
preliminary conversations and interviews between a prospective witness and an
attorney if they are some way related to or connected with a pending or
contemplated action. (Ascherman v. Natanson (1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 861,
865.) 
            
            Defendant argues that Plaintiffs’
claims are barred by the litigation privilege because “First, the alleged
disclosures were made pursuant to a subpoena in a judicial proceeding. (SAC, ¶¶
8-9.) Second, [Defendant] is a participant in the litigation as authorized by
law because it was brought into the litigation via subpoena. (Id.) Third,
alleged disclosure was made to comply with a subpoena initiated by a court
appointed receiver. (Id.) Last, the Subpoena bore a relation to the proceeding
as it arose out of a district court judgment. (Id.)” (Demurrer, p. 11:9-13.) 
 
The Court finds that the Plaintiffs have
failed to alleged facts on the face of complaint to state a cause of action
because the claims are barred by the litigation privilege. In the SAC,
Plaintiffs assert that the allegedly improper disclosures occurred when Defendant
received and responded to a subpoena for documents related to an arbitration proceeding
between Plaintiffs and the Houston Rockets. (SAC ¶¶ 7-8.)  The conduct in question is therefore covered
by the litigation privilege. 
 
In addition, Plaintiffs have failed to
oppose the demurrer or offer any explanation as to why the litigation privilege
does not apply. The Court construes Plaintiffs lack of opposition as a tacit
admission that Defendants arguments are meritorious. (Sexton v. Superior
Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) 
 
Thus, based on the foregoing, the Court
SUSTAINS the Demurrer in its entirety. Because the Court finds sufficient cause
to sustain the Demurrer on the above stated grounds, it need not reach
Defendant’s other arguments. 
 
Because this is Plaintiffs’ third
unsuccessful attempt to allege a claim that is not barred by the litigation
privilege, they have demonstrated their inability to do so.  Defendant’s Demurrer to Plaintiffs Second
Amended Complaint is therefore SUSTAINED without leave to amend. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.

tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
