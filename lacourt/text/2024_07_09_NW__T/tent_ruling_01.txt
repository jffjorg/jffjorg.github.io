  Case Number:  20VECV01236    Hearing Date:   July 9, 2024    Dept:  T HADDADI V KEY TOY 20VECV01236
[TENTATIVE] ORDER: 
Petitioner/Defendant Key Toy, LLC’s Petition to Confirm Arbitration
Award is GRANTED.  
Introduction 
Petitioner/Defendants Key Toy, LLC. and Wael Ghali petition
to confirm the arbitration award awarded against Respondent/Plaintiff Loubna
Haddadi (Plaintiff). The arbitration award granted summary judgment in favor of
Defendants.   No opposition was filed.
Discussion 
Defendants submitted a copy of the arbitration award levied
against Plaintiff that was entered on April 22, 2024.  Unless a petition or response seeking to
correct or vacate an arbitration award was filed properly based upon valid
grounds, or the proceeding is dismissed, courts are required to enter judgment
in conformity with the award.  (Code of
Civ. Proc. sec. 1286; Valsan Partners Ltd. Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility
(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 809, 818.)  Because
Plaintiff did not file a separate petition to correct or vacate and did not
file a response/opposition to the instant Petition despite sufficient notice
and opportunity to be heard, the Petition is persuasive.  
The Petition to Confirm the Award is GRANTED.
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO ENTER JUDGMENT AND
GIVE NOTICE OF ENTRY.
