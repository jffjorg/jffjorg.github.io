And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is as follows:

The Defendant, David Malka, has filed a demurrer to the Plaintiff, Aaron Rosen's, complaint, which includes five causes of action. The Judge has ruled that the first cause of action for breach of oral contract is sustained with 20 days leave to amend, as the complaint does not allege consideration. The second, third, and fourth causes of action, which are common counts, account stated, and unjust enrichment, respectively, are overruled.

The Judge has also ruled that the fifth cause of action for promissory fraud is overruled, as the complaint has alleged facts sufficient to constitute this cause of action.

Additionally, the Judge has denied the Defendant's motion to strike the exemplary damages allegations, as the complaint has alleged facts sufficient to support this claim.

The Judge's ruling is based on the doctrine of res judicata, which states that a voluntary dismissal without prejudice has no claim-preclusive effect upon a later suit. The Judge has also considered the allegations of consideration, intent to defraud, and the falsity of the promise made by the Defendant.

Overall, the Judge's tentative ruling is that the Defendant's demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave to amend as to the first cause of action, and overruled as to the second, third, fourth, and fifth causes of action, and that the motion to strike is denied.
