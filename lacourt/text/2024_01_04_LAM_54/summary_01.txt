And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motions to consolidate the two cases (21STCV34663 and 21STCV39136) and to continue the trial. The cases involve different causes of action, including defamation, trade libel, breach of contract, and non-payment of wages, and the judge believes that consolidating them would not avoid unnecessary costs and delays. The judge also notes that the parties waited over a year to seek consolidation and made efforts to postpone the trial by at least eight months. As a result, the judge finds that good cause has not been shown for a trial continuance and that the cases should be resolved separately.
