            On September 20, 2021, Plaintiffs filed case number
21STCV34663. (Spolsky Decl. ¶ 17.) Plaintiffs
causes of action are for defamation, trade libel, breach of contract, negligent
interference with prospective economic relations, intentional interference with
prospective economic relations, intentional interference with contractual
relations, negligent infliction of emotional distress, intentional infliction
of emotional distress, unjust enrichment, and injunctive relief. (Spolsky Decl.
¶ 18.)
On October 25, 2021,
Defendants Chagit Yamini and Limor Rad filed case number 21STCV39136. (Spolsky
Decl. ¶ 19.) Defendants causes of action are for breach of contract, failure to
pay regular and overtime wages, failure to pay minimum wage, failure to furnish
accurate itemized wage statement, failure to pay all wages upon discharged,
unlawful and/or unfair business practices, common counts, and fraud. (Spolsky
Decl. ¶ 20.) 
Both cases stem from
employment of Defendants by Plaintiffs starting in November 2019. (Spolsky
Decl. ¶ 21.) Plaintiff’s Complaint states Defendants were terminated in March
2021 (Plaintiffs’ Complaint ¶¶ 13 and 14; Spolsky Decl. ¶ 22.) While the Yamini
Complaint (21STCV39136) adds Defendants complained to Plaintiffs on or about
June 2021 about not receiving payment. (Spolsky Decl. ¶ 23.)
On November 14, 2023,
Plaintiffs filed a notice of related case. On November 21, 2023, the Court
found that the cases are not related. (11/21/23 Minute Order.)
            On
November 30, 2023, the Court denied a Joint Stipulation and [Proposed] Order to
Consolidate and To Continue Trial. On December 15, 2023 the Court denied
Plaintiff’s ex parte to continue the trial.
“When
actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the
court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue
in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such
orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or
delay.”  (CCP § 1048(a).) 
 
As
the Court indicated in the prior proceedings, the Court is unpersuaded that these
actions involve common questions, or that consolidating them at this late date would
avoid unnecessary cost and delay. The Court notes that the parties waited more
than a year to seek consolidation of these matters, did so only as the trial date
approached, and accompanied their requests with efforts to postpone the trial
by at least eight months. The Court again finds that the cases should not be
consolidated and good cause has not been shown for a trial continuance. At this
point discovery should be completed and the parties should be far along in
their efforts to resolve the cases and prepare for trial. 
 
The
motions are DENIED.
