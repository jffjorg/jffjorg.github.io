And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to stay the case in part, staying the proceedings only as to defendant Alexander R. Baldwin III and El Dorado Pictures Inc. The stay is granted due to the ongoing grand jury proceedings in New Mexico and the renewed possibility of criminal charges against Baldwin, which could implicate his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The court finds that protecting Baldwin's constitutional right is paramount and that a stay is necessary to avoid extreme prejudice to him. The court will set an Order to Show Cause concerning the stay in approximately 180 days to re-evaluate the status of the criminal proceedings against Baldwin. The case will move forward as to the other defendants.
