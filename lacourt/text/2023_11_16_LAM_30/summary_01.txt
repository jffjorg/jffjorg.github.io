Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiffs' motion to compel the deposition of Defendant's PMQ (person) and production of documents. The Court grants the motion as to certain categories and requests, but denies it in part due to the Defendant's objections. The categories and requests that are granted are directly related to the Plaintiff's vehicle and concern Defendant's decision on whether to repurchase the vehicle. The Court finds that these items are relevant for purposes of discovery. The categories and requests that are denied are too broad and seek information that is not relevant to the claims. The Court denies monetary sanctions due to the partial denial of the motion.
