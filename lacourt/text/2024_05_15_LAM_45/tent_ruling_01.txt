Motion to Compel Responses to the Request for Production of Documents, Set 1

The Court
considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
            SLW
Holdings, LLC’s Motion to Compel
Responses to the Request for Production of Documents, Set 1 from Defendant Wolfgang
& Associates, LLC is DENIED
as moot. The request for sanctions is granted in the amount of $1,860.00.
Sanctions are to be paid within 10 days of this order. With regard to obtaining
further responses to the Request for
Production of Documents, Set 1, if SLW Holdings, LLC’s counsel deems further responses necessary,
counsel is instructed to file a motion to compel further responses.  

 

Background
- 
            This
instant matter, case no. 21STCV20050,
has been consolidated with a related matter, case no. 21STCV26774. Both matters
arise out of similar facts.
            On July 21, 2021, Genetixs, LLC, a
business licensed to engage in the lawful business of cultivation,
distribution, and sales of cannabis, filed a Complaint containing twelve causes
of action against several defendants, including SLW Holdings, LLC (Plaintiff/Cross-Complainant,
hereinafter, “SLW”.) On April 20, 2023, SLW filed their Second Amended
Complaint (SAC) against several defendants including Wolfgang & Associates,
LLC (Defendant). The complaints stem from allegations by SLW against Defendant of
fraud, while Genetixs, LLC in turn alleges fraud against SLW. 
            The motion before the Court is SLW’s
Motion to Compel Responses
to the Request for Production of Documents, Set 1 from Defendant Wolfgang &
Associates, LLC and Request for
Monetary Sanctions (the Motion). Defendant opposes the Motion, and SLW files a
reply.
 
Legal
Standard - 
            “If
a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the following rules shall
apply: (a) The party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4…(b) The party
making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (c)
Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP §
2031.300)
            “The
court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay
the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct.” (CCP § 2023.030(a).) “Misuses of the discovery process
include, but are not limited to, the following: (d) Failing to respond or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” (CCP § 2023.010)
Evidentiary
Objections - 
            Upon
reply, SLW makes several objections to the Declaration of Salomon Zavala
(Zavala Decl.). The Zavala Decl. was filed concurrently with Defendant’s
opposition papers. The Court sustains each objection.
Discussion
- 
            Defendant failed to timely respond to
discovery
            In their moving papers, SLW states
that on August 3, 2023, SLW served Defendant with Request for Production, Set 1
and that responses were due on September 5, 2023. (Moving Papers, 1:5-7.) On
September 5, 2023, an extension was granted to Defendant by SLW’s counsel,
yielding a new deadline of September 26, 2023. (Moving Papers, 1:9-10.)
However, when the September 26, 2023 deadline came, no responses were provided.
As of the date of this Motion, no responses had been provided. 
            Upon opposition, Defendant argues
that (1) responses were provided on February 12, 2024 and (2) the deadline was
missed due to “mistake, inadvertence, and/or excusable
neglect”. As to this second point,
Defense counsel Salomon Zavala (Zavala) specifically states that he thought
that his colleague Ché Hashim was handling the matter. (Opposition Papers,
1:13-15.) Zavala claims that it was not until November 1, 2023, when the instant
Motion was filed, did Zavala become aware of the fact that no responses were
submitted. Defendant additionally presents a third argument; the Motion does
not conform to Cal. Rules of Court 3.1345 which Defendant claims requires a
separate statement for a motion such as this one. The Court will take each of
the three arguments in turn.
            First, although responses were
provided on February 12, 2024, even if discovery responses have been served,
the Court can still award sanctions. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 407.)        Second, Defendant provides no explanation
for why it took Defendant until February 12, 2024 for deliver responses. The
first missed deadline was September 26, 2023. Additionally, SLW states they
wrote to Defendant pointing out responses had yet to be received but received
no response from Defendant. (Moving Papers, 1:12-17.) Defendant then became
explicitly aware that responses were missing after the Motion was filed on
November 1, 2023. This is a total of five months where responses were never
provided, including instances where Defense counsel was notified twice.
Defendant is silent as to how this delay was the cause of mistake,
inadvertence, and/or excusable neglect.
Moreover, upon reply, SLW casts doubt on whether the responses were in full
compliance. The Court finds that Defendant’s opposition papers fail to provide
an explanation sufficient to satisfy Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subds.
(a)(1) & (a)(2).
            Finally,
Defendant’s contention that this Motion must conform to Cal. Rules of Court 3.1345 is inaccurate. Cal. Rules of Court 3.1345
applies to motions to compel further, motions to compel answers or production
of documents at a deposition, motions to quash, and motions to compel a medical
examination. (See Cal. Rules of Court 3.1345(a)(1)-(a)(7).) The instant motion
to compel initial responses is not subject to the requirements of Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1345(a). 
            The
Court notes that although SLW states in their reply which specific requests
they contend are not in substantial compliance, any request for further
responses must be made in a motion to compel further responses. Accordingly,
the Motion is denied as moot, however, sanctions are warranted. 
            Sanctions
            SLW’s counsel provides their
calculations below:
·        
Counsel’s
hourly rate is $450.00
·        
Counsel
spent 3.5 hours preparing the instant Motion
·        
Counsel
anticipated spending 2 hours reviewing opposition papers and preparing a reply
·        
Counsel
also anticipates 1.5 hours at the hearing plus costs of $20
·        
Counsel
incurred a $60.00 filing fee
            Considering the routine subject
matter of the Motion, and the extensive delay by Defendant, the Court imposes
sanctions on Defendant Wolfgang & Associates, LLC, and
awards them to SLW in the amount of $1,860.00.  
Conclusion – 
            Accordingly,
SLW Holdings, LLC’s Motion to Compel
Responses to the Request for Production of Documents, Set 1 from Defendant Wolfgang
& Associates, LLC is DENIED
as moot. The request for sanctions is granted in the amount of $1,860.00.
Sanctions are to be paid within 10 days of this order. With regard to obtaining
further responses to the Request for
Production of Documents, Set 1, if SLW Holdings, LLC’s counsel deems further responses necessary,
counsel is instructed to file a motion to compel further responses.  
 
            It
is so ordered.

Background
-             This
instant matter, case no. 21STCV20050,
has been consolidated with a related matter, case no. 21STCV26774. Both matters
arise out of similar facts.            On July 21, 2021, Genetixs, LLC, a

submit to an authorized method of discovery.” (CCP § 2023.010) Evidentiary
Objections (if applicable) -             Upon
reply, SLW makes several objections to the Declaration of Salomon Zavala
(Zavala Decl.). The Zavala Decl. was filed concurrently with Defendant’s
opposition papers. The Court notes that the docket reflects only one Zavala
Decl. was filed in relation to a motion to compel initial responses, and it was
filed by Defendant Wolfgang & Associates, LLC, likely in relation to the
Reservation ID No. 8112-3113-1113[1].
Therefore, the objections will not be considered on the instant Motion. Discussion
-             Defendant failed to timely respond to discovery            Attached to the moving papers, SLW
submits the Declaration of Raphael B. Emanuel (Emanuel Decl.) which states that
on August 3, 2023, SLW served Defendant with Request for Production, Set 1 and
that responses were due on September 5, 2023. (Emanuel Decl., ¶¶3-4.) On
September 5, 2023, Defense counsel Ché Hashim requested an extension, which was
granted by SLW’s counsel, yielding a new deadline of September 26, 2023.
(Emanuel Decl., ¶5.) However, when the September 26, 2023 deadline came, no
responses were provided. As of the date of the Emanuel Decl., October 31, 2023,
no responses had been provided.             Upon opposition, Defendant argues
that (1) responses were provided on February 12, 2024 and (2) the deadline was
missed due to “mistake, inadvertence, and/or excusable
neglect”. As to this second point,
Defense counsel Salomon Zavala (Zavala) specifically states that he thought
that his colleague Ché Hashim was handling the matter. (Opposition Papers,
1:13-15.) Zavala claims that it was not until November 1, 2023, when the

first missed deadline was September 26, 2023. Additionally, SLW states they
wrote to Defendant pointing out responses had yet to be received but got no
