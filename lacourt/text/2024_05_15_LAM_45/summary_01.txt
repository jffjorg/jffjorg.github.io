Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the motion filed by SLW Holdings, LLC to compel responses to a request for production of documents, set 1, from Defendant Wolfgang & Associates, LLC. The court finds that the defendant failed to timely respond to discovery and has delayed providing responses for an extended period of time. Despite opposition from the defendant, the court grants the motion for sanctions and awards $1,860.00 to SLW Holdings, LLC. The court also denies the motion to compel responses as moot, as the defendant has finally provided some responses. The court notes that any further requests for responses must be made in a separate motion. The court's ruling is subject to change and a final ruling will be issued after the hearing on May 15, 2024.
