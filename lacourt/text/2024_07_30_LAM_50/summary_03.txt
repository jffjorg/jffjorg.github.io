And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a petition to approve a settlement between the minor claimants (Shilon Aleyna Hernandez-Sandoval and Christopher Odir Hernandez Sandoval) and the defendants (Rampart Village Villas LLC and Winstar Properties LLC) in a pending action. The settlement was reached after the parties had alleged causes of action for breach of warranty of habitability, breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, negligence, and breach of contract. The judge finds that the settlement is reasonable and intends to grant the petition and approve the compromise, subject to the examination of the petitioner at the hearing and confirmation that the attorney represents all of the plaintiffs. However, the judge notes that there appears to be an error in the petition, as it seems that the attorney represents each of the plaintiffs, and also notes that the box preceding Item 8(a)(2) on forms MC-351 is not checked.
