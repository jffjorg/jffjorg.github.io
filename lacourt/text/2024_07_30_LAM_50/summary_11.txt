And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled that the Association's motion to compel arbitration is denied without prejudice. The Judge found that the Association did not provide sufficient evidence that the Plaintiff's claims against it were not resolved through the mediation procedures set forth in the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions of 388. The Judge also noted that the Association's motion did not state the nature of the order being sought and the grounds for issuance of the order, as required by California Rules of Court. The Judge concluded that the Section 5 "Mandatory Binding Arbitration" provision of the CC&R does not apply to the Plaintiff's claims in this action such that the Court should compel arbitration.
