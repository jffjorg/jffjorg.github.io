[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff
Pacific Eurotex Corp. (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default judgment against Defendant
David Talasazan. Plaintiff requests judgment in the total amount of $44,528.12,
comprising $42,333.08 in damages, $535.00 in costs, and $1,660.04 in attorney
fees. 
The
Court notes one defect with the submitted default judgment package. 
The
“Declaration for Default Judgment by Court” in support of the request indicates
that Plaintiff seeks holdover damages for the period of October 1, 2023 to
December 15, 2023. Plaintiff appears to indicate that there are 76 days between
these dates. (See Declaration, Item 12(c).) However, there are 75 days
between October 1, 2023 and December 15, 2023. $333.33 per day multiplied by 75
days is $24,999.75. However, Plaintiff seeks $25,333.08 in holdover damages
based on 76 days.  
The
Court will discuss this issue with Plaintiff at the hearing.
