Background
On October 5, 2023, Plaintiffs Hilda Bennett, an individual; Hilda
Bennett, Trustee of the B and H Family Trust; Yolanda Tellez; and Gustavo
Rodriguez filed this action against Defendant Hugo Rodriguez. The Complaint
alleges one cause of action for partition of real property. 
On April 3, 2024, Hugo A. Rodriguez aka Antonio H. Rodriguez as
Trustee of the Hugo A. Rodriguez aka Antonio H. Rodriguez and Antonio H.
Rodriguez Trust filed the operative First Amended Cross-Complaint against Cross-Defendants
Hilda Bennett, an individual; Hilda R. Bennett, Trustee of the B and H Bennett
Family Trust; and Yolanda Tellez, alleging causes of action for (1) conversion
and (2) negligence. 
On May 6, 2024, Hilda R Bennett, Yolanda Tellez, and Gustavo Rodriguez
(collectively, “Cross-Defendants”) filed a Verified Answer to First Amended
Cross-Complaint. 
Hugo Rodriguez (“Rodriguez”) now appears to demur to Cross-Defendants’
Verified Answer to First Amended Cross-Complaint. Hilda Bennett, an individual;
Hilda R Bennett, Trustee of the B and H Bennett Family Trust; Yolanda Tellez;
and Gustavo Rodriguez oppose. 
Discussion

does not appear that Rodriguez filed any declaration in support of the demurrer demonstrating that he
met and conferred with Cross-Defendants in advance of filing the demurrer. 
 Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a), “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone,
or by video conference with the party who filed the pleading that is
subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be
reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Emphasis
added.) Such meeting and conferring must be done in good faith with an
effort to try to resolve the issues subject to the demurrer. 
In light of the foregoing,
the hearing on Rodriguez’s demurrer
is continued to _______________,
2024 at 2:00 p.m. in Dept. 50.
