[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:  
 
PETITION TO APPROVE MINOR’S COMPROMISE OF
  PENDING ACTION (2)



            Background
            On May 31, 2023, Plaintiffs
Mario Alonso Sandoval-Gonzalez; Norma Guadalupe Moreira Pacheco; Diana
Sandoval; Odir Alvaro Hernandez Hernandez; Shilon Aleyna Hernandez-Sandoval, a
minor by and through her guardian ad litem, Diana Sandoval; and Christopher
Odir Hernandez Sandoval, a minor by and through his guardian ad litem, Diana
Sandoval (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) filed this action against Defendants Rampart Village Villas LLC
and Winstar Properties LLC.  The
Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) breach of warranty of habitability,
(2) breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, (3) negligence, and 
(4) breach of contract. 
The parties have reached a settlement in this matter. Diana Sandoval as Petitioner for
Claimants Shilon Aleyna Hernandez-Sandoval and Christopher Odir
Hernandez Sandoval now petitions for the Court’s approval of the settlement on
behalf of each of the Claimants.  
            Discussion
An enforceable settlement of a minor’s claim can only be consummated
with court approval. (Prob. Code, § 3500.) “A petition for court approval of a compromise of, or a
covenant not to sue or enforce judgment, on a minor’s disputed claim; a
compromise or settlement of a pending action or proceeding to which a minor or
person with a disability is a party; or the disposition of the proceeds of a
judgment for a minor or person with a disability under Probate
Code sections 3500 and 3600-3613 or Code of Civil
Procedure section 372 must be verified by the petitioner and must contain a
full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness
of the compromise, covenant, settlement, or disposition. Except as provided in rule 7.950.5, the petition must be submitted on a
completed Petition for Approval of
Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for
Minor or Person With a Disability (form MC-350).”
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950, emphasis in original.)  
Both of the petitions are prepared on form
MC-350 and are verified by the Petitioner. The Court finds that the settlement is
reasonable. However, the Court notes that Items 17(e) of the petitions
provide that “[t]he attorney…is not…representing or employed by
any other party or any insurance carrier involved in the matter. (If you
answered ‘is,’ identify the party or carrier and explain the relationship in
Attachment 17e.).” (Emphasis added.) This seems to be an error, as it appears Petitioner’s
counsel represents each of the Plaintiffs in this matter. 
In addition, as to both Claimants, the box preceding Item 8(a)(2) on forms MC-351 is not checked. 
            Conclusion
Based
on the foregoing and subject to the examination
of Petitioner at the hearing and Petitioner confirming at the hearing that the
attorney is representing all of the Plaintiffs, the Court intends to grant the petitions and approve the compromise. The
Court intends to check the requisite box in Item 8(a)(2 on forms MC-351 before
signing the Orders. ¿ 
Petitioner is to
give notice of this ruling.
