Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed Plaintiff's request for default judgment against Defendants Darian Foods Inc. and Hwa Ok Yang. However, the court has found several defects in the request, including a lack of proper notice to the defendants, unclear calculations of interest, and failure to use the proper form for a default judgment. The court also notes that the requested late fees are not alleged in the complaint and that the definition of "collateral" in the proposed judgment does not match the definition in the complaint. Additionally, the court has not received a copy of the original promissory note. As a result, the court denies Plaintiff's request for default judgment without prejudice and will discuss with Plaintiff a schedule for resubmission of the default judgment package.
