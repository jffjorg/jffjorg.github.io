And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is based on the case between Armen Temurian and Luis Amaya, the plaintiffs, and Sathiya Araj Rasiah, aka Raj Milton, George Akopian, and Raju Rasiah, the defendants. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants failed to deliver operational "Mini-Miners" and software necessary to establish "Slush Pool" and are seeking to disqualify Stephen Feldman, the attorney representing the defendants, from representing them. The plaintiffs argue that Feldman received confidential information from them and that this information is material to the case.

The court finds that the plaintiffs have demonstrated good cause for disqualifying Feldman from representing the defendants. The court notes that the issue of disqualification ultimately involves a conflict between the clients' right to counsel of their choice and the need to maintain ethical standards of professional responsibility.

The court further notes that disqualification is warranted in cases where an attorney receives confidential information from an adverse party and that this situation implicates the attorney's ethical duty to maintain the integrity of the judicial process.

The court grants the motion to disqualify Feldman from representing the defendants.
