ANTONELLA SEMERE,
                        Plaintiff,
            v.
 
HAWAIIAN GARDENS CASINO,
  
                        Defendant.
  


 
  Case No.:  23STCV15760
  Hearing Date:  May 8, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to lift stay 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On July 6, 2023, Plaintiff Antonella
Semere filed this action against Defendant Hawaiian Gardens Casino, alleging
(1) discrimination, (2) retaliation, (3) failure to prevent, and (4) wrongful
termination. 
            On November 21, 2023, the Court
denied Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration. Defendant appealed the order,
and the case was stayed accordingly. 
            On April 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to lift the stay pending appeal. Defendant filed its
opposition on April 25, 2024. Plaintiff filed her reply on May 1, 2024.
DISCUSSION
I.
Automatic Stay
            Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 916(a), “the perfecting of an appeal stays proceedings in the trial
court upon the judgment or order appealed from or upon the matters embraced
therein or affected thereby.” Section 916 implements an automatic stay “to
protect the appellate court's jurisdiction by preserving the status quo until
the appeal is decided.” (Cunningham v. Magidow (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th
298, 303-304.) However, effective January 1, 2024, SB 365 amended Code of Civil
Procedure section 1294(a) to provide that “[n]otwithstanding Section 916, the
perfecting of . . . an appeal [from an order denying a petition to compel
arbitration] shall not automatically stay any proceedings in the trial court
during the pendency of the appeal.” Defendant argues that SB 365 is preempted
by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). 
II.
Application of the FAA
            The FAA applies to contracts
“evidencing a transaction involving commerce.” (9 U.S.C. § 2.) The term
“involving commerce” is interpreted to mean simply “affecting commerce” to give
the FAA the broadest reach possible, and does not require a transaction that is
actually “within the flow of interstate commerce.” (See Allied-Bruce
Terminix Co. v. Dobson (1995) 513 U.S. 265, 273-74; Citizens Bank v.
Alafabco, Inc. (2003) 539 U.S. 52, 56.) Moreover, parties may agree to
apply the FAA notwithstanding any effect on interstate commerce. (Victrola
89, LLC v. Jaman Properties 8 LLC (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 337, 355.) 
            Here, the arbitration agreement, if
it is found to exist, expressly provides that it is governed by the FAA. (Rojas
Decl. ISO Mtn. to Compel Arb., Ex. B.) Plaintiff’s employment also “involved”
commerce because Plaintiff worked at a casino which serves out-of-state
customers and purchases equipment from out-of-state vendors. (Id., ¶ 2.)
Therefore, if the Court of Appeal finds that an agreement to arbitrate exists,
it would be governed by the FAA. 
III.
Preemption
The FAA provides that “an agreement in
writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a
contract, transaction, or refusal, shall be valid, irrevocable, and
enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the
revocation of any contract.” (9 U.S.C. § 2.) The FAA “requires courts to place
arbitration agreements ‘on equal footing with all other contracts.’” (Kindred
Nursing Ctrs. Ltd. P'ship v. Clark (2017) 581 U.S. 246, 248.) This means
that “[a] court may invalidate an arbitration agreement based on ‘generally
applicable contract defenses’ like fraud or unconscionability, but not on legal
rules that ‘apply only to arbitration or that derive their meaning from the
fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue.’” (Id. at p. 251.) A
state law is also preempted if it “interferes with fundamental attributes of
arbitration” or has a “disproportionate impact on arbitration.” (Chamber of
Commerce of the United States v. Bonta (9th Cir. 2023) 62 F.4th 473, 483.) 
In Coinbase, Inc. v. Bielski (2023)
599 U.S. 736, the U.S. Supreme Court held that a federal district court must
stay its proceedings during an interlocutory appeal of an order denying a
petition to compel arbitration. The court in Coinbase reasoned that “it
makes no sense for trial to go forward while the court of appeals cogitates on
whether there should be one.” (Id. at p. 1920.) “If the district court
could move forward with pre-trial and trial proceedings while the appeal on
arbitrability was ongoing, then many of the asserted benefits of arbitration
(efficiency, less expense, less intrusive discovery, and the like) would be
irretrievably lost—even if the court of appeals later concluded that the case
actually had belonged in arbitration all along.” (Id. at p. 1921.) 
While Coinbase did not directly
address preemption, it demonstrates how a law like SB 365 “interferes with
fundamental attributes of arbitration” or “subtly discourag[es] arbitration.”
(See Chamber of Commerce, supra, 62 F.4th at p. 483; Gallo v. Wood
Ranch USA, Inc.
(2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 621, 641.) The entire purpose of arbitration is to bypass
the cost and time of traditional litigation. But as Coinbase points out,
those fundamental attributes would be “irretrievably lost” if parties are
required to litigate a matter that is subsequently determined to be arbitrable.
In this way, SB 365 makes it possible to effectively nullify arbitration
agreements. SB 365 creates an exception to the automatic stay rule that applies
only to arbitration. Therefore, SB 365 discriminates against arbitration and is
preempted by the FAA. Without SB 365, the case is automatically stayed under
Code of Civil Procedure section 916(a). 
III.
Discretionary Stay
Even without an automatic stay, “[c]ourts
have inherent authority to control their own calendars and dockets . . . .” (Walker
v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 257, 267.) This includes “the inherent
power to stay proceedings in the interests of justice and to promote judicial
efficiency.” (Freiberg v. City of Mission Viejo (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th
1484, 1489.) “Because the issues subject to litigation . . . might overlap
those that are subject to arbitration . . ., the trial court must order an
appropriate stay of trial court proceedings.” (Franco v. Arakelian
Enterprises, Inc. (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 947, 966.) “The stay's purpose is
to preserve the status quo until the arbitration is resolved, preventing any
continuing trial court proceedings from disrupting and rendering
ineffective the arbitrator's jurisdiction to decide the issues that are subject
to arbitration.” (Ibid.) 
In this case, the Court finds that a stay
is warranted for the reasons articulated in Coinbase. That is, the
entire point of arbitration would be defeated if the parties litigate the case
in court, only for the Court of Appeal to hold that the matter should have been
arbitrated. This would result in substantial prejudice to both parties and the
court in the form of duplication and waste. Furthermore, Defendant would be
prejudiced if trial is not stayed pending the appeal of an arguably meritorious
claim. (See Meehan v. Hopps (1995) 45 Cal.2d 213, 218.) The Court finds
that Defendant has an arguably meritorious claim.  
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to lift stay is DENIED.
