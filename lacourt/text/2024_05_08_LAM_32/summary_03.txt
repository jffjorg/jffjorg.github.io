Here is a brief summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that Plaintiff Antonella Semere's motion to lift the stay pending appeal is denied. The case involves allegations of discrimination, retaliation, failure to prevent, and wrongful termination by Defendant Hawaiian Gardens Casino. The judge finds that the stay should be maintained due to the potential for prejudice to both parties and the court if the case is litigated in court and then ultimately found to be arbitrable. The judge cites the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) and California Code of Civil Procedure section 916(a) in support of the decision.
