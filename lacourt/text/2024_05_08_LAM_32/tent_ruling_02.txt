  Case No.:  23STCP04679
  Hearing Date:  May 8, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendants’ demurrer to first amended
  complaint 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On December 29, 2023, Plaintiff
Alliance for the Fair Access to Cryptocurrency Terminals filed this action for
declaratory and injunctive relief. Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended
Complaint on March 4, 2024, naming as Defendants the State of California and
the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation.  
            Through this action, Plaintiff
challenges Financial Code section 3902, which states that “[a]n operator shall
not accept or dispense more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) in a day from or
to a customer via a digital financial asset transaction kiosk.” Plaintiff
alleges that the daily cap harms cryptocurrency kiosk operators and associated
businesses without a corresponding benefit to consumer protection. Plaintiff
alleges that the Legislature enacted Section 3902 based on speculation and
animus. Plaintiff contends that Section 3902 is arbitrary and capricious in
violation of the California Constitution. 
            On April 5, 2024, Defendants filed
the instant demurrer to the FAC. Plaintiff filed its opposition on April 24,
2024. Defendants filed their reply on May 1, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether a
pleading states a cause of action or defense. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the
pleading or by proper judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd.
(a).) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior
Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the pleading, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action or defense. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
MEET AND CONFER
Before filing a demurrer or a motion to
strike, the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the
party who filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the
motion to strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be
reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.)
The Court notes that Defendants have complied with the meet and confer
requirement. (See Barsegyan Decl.)
DISCUSSION
I.
Claims Against State of California
            “[I]n actions for declaratory and
injunctive relief challenging the constitutionality of state statutes, state
officers with statewide administrative functions under the challenged statute
are the proper parties defendant.” (Serrano v. Priest (1976) 18 Cal.3d
728, 752.) In this case, the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation
is charged with enforcing the pertinent statutory provisions. (Fin. Code, §§
3102(f), 3403.) Plaintiff agrees that the State may be dismissed from the case.
(Opp. 9:23-27.) Therefore, the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend as
to the claims against the State. 
II.
Sufficiency of the Allegations
The FAC seeks a judicial declaration that
Financial Code section 3902 is unconstitutional, with associated injunctive
relief to stop enforcement of the statute. “Any person interested under a
written instrument . . . or under a contract . . . may, in cases of actual
controversy relating to the legal rights and duties of the respective parties,
bring an original action or cross-complaint in the superior court for a
declaration of his or her rights and duties . . . arising under the instrument
or contract.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1060.) A complaint for declaratory relief
need only state “facts establishing the existence of an actual controversy.” (Ludgate
Ins. Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 592, 606.) “[T]o be
entitled to declaratory relief, a party need not establish that it is also
entitled to a favorable judgment.” (Ibid.) However, “[a] general
demurrer to a declaratory relief cause of action is proper when the plaintiff
does not allege facts sufficient to state the derivative claim.” (Allen v.
City of Sacramento (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 41, 54.) 
 “[S]ubstantive
due process . . . prevents government from enacting legislation that is ‘arbitrary’
or ‘discriminatory’ or lacks ‘a reasonable relation to a proper legislative
purpose.’” (Kavanau v. Santa Monica Rent Control Bd. (1997) 16 Cal.4th
761, 771.) An enactment pursuant to the state’s police powers will be upheld if
“it is reasonably related to promoting the public health, safety, comfort, and
welfare, and if the means adopted to accomplish that promotion are reasonably
appropriate to the purpose.” (Sunset Amusement Co. v. Board of Police
Comm'rs (1972) 7 Cal.3d 64, 72.) 
The FAC alleges that Financial Code
section 3902 unfairly targets a service that accounts for a miniscule portion
of overall illegal activity in the finance sector. (FAC ¶¶ 11-13.) The daily
cap allegedly does not prevent individuals from exchanging substantial amounts
of cryptocurrency nor deter criminal activity. (Id., ¶ 20.) The FAC
alleges that the cap will force consumers to use other financial services that
are riskier to use. (Id., ¶ 24.) The FAC alleges that legislators
targeted the crypto industry to appear “tough on crime” and acted out of
disdain for crypto operators. (Id., ¶¶ 18, 28, 29.) 
For pleading purposes, these facts support
a reasonable inference that the challenged law was passed with discriminatory
intent and has no reasonable relation to a proper legislative purpose. Thus,
Plaintiff has “allege[d] facts sufficient to state the derivative claim” that
the law is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Constitution. (See Allen,
supra, 234 Cal.App.4th at p. 54.) The FAC alleges that Defendants contend
the statute is lawful. (FAC ¶ 42.) Therefore, Plaintiff has sufficiently
alleged an actual controversy for purposes of declaratory relief. Plaintiff
need not otherwise “establish that it is also entitled to a favorable judgment.”
(Ludgate, supra, 82 Cal.App.4th at p. 606.)   
Defendants argue that the Court may take
judicial notice of the legislative history to find as a matter of law that the
statute was enacted for a lawful purpose. However, “[w]hile courts take judicial notice of public records, they do not take
notice of the truth of matters stated therein.” (Herrera v. Deutsche Bank
National Trust Co. (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1375.) “When judicial
notice is taken of a document, … the truthfulness and proper interpretation of
the document are disputable.” (Ibid.) On a demurrer, the facts alleged
in the FAC are assumed to be true. The FAC alleges that the legislature acted
out of disdain for the crypto industry and enacted a law that does not
reasonably relate to the legitimate purpose of combating fraud. Defendants cannot
raise a contrary inference using extrinsic evidence such as legislative
findings, at least not on a demurrer. As Plaintiff points out, this is a “one-sided
presentation of evidence that has not been tested in discovery.” (Opp.
5:22-23.) Whether the rationale expressed in Defendants’ proffered material
properly supports the enactment of Financial Code section 3902 is
precisely the type of dispute justifying declaratory relief. This dispute
cannot be resolved at the pleading stage. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendants’ demurrer is SUSTAINED
without leave to amend as to all claims against the State of California. The
demurrer is OVERRULED in all other respects.
