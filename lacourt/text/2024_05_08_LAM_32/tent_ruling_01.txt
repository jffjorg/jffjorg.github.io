     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant bobby saadian’s motions to
  compel responses (CRS# 2284, 1926, 3398, 6095)




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On August 17, 2022, Plaintiff filed
this legal malpractice action against Defendants Bobby Babak Saadian and
Wilshire Law Firm, PLC. Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint
on December 6, 2022, asserting causes of action for (1) legal malpractice, (2)
breach of fiduciary duty, and (3) fraud. 
            On April 11, 2024, Defendant Saadian
filed the instant four motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses to form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production, and to
deem as admitted the matters specified in requests for admissions. Plaintiff
has not filed an opposition to any of the motions. All four motions are
advanced and heard on this date (May 8, 2024). 
LEGAL STANDARD
 Discovery responses are due 30 days after
service of the requests, unless the parties stipulate or the court orders
otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260(a), 2031.260(a), 2033.250(a).) If a
responding party fails to respond in time, the propounding party may move for
an order compelling the responses or deeming matters admitted. (Id., §§
2030.290(b), 2031.300(b), 2033.280(b).) The responding party also waives its
objections. (Id., §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a).)  
DISCUSSION
            Defendant served the subject
discovery on January 18, 2024. (Coronel Decl. ¶ 2.) On February 26, 2024,
Defendant granted a 15-day extension. (Id., ¶ 3.) Plaintiff failed to
serve responses by the new deadline of March 4, 2024. (Id., ¶ 4.) Plaintiff
has provided no substantial justification, thus sanctions are warranted.
Defense counsel reasonably claims an hourly rate of $250. (See Coronel Decl. ¶
5.) Given the simplicity of the motions and lack of opposition, the reasonable
number of hours is 4 hours. Therefore, the total amount of sanctions is $1,000.
CONCLUSION
            Defendant Bobby Saadian’s motions to
compel responses and deem matters admitted are GRANTED. The Court sanctions
Plaintiff and her counsel in the total amount of $1,000.
