provides: 
“(a) When actions involving a common question of law
or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of
any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions
consolidated and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may
tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1048,
subd. (a).) 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a), provides: 
“(a)
Requirements of motion

of motion to consolidate must: 
“(A)  List all
named parties in each case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names
of their respective attorneys of record; 
“(B)  Contain
the captions of all the cases sought to be consolidated, with the lowest
numbered case shown first; and 
“(C)  Be filed
in each case sought to be consolidated. 
“(2)  The motion
to consolidate:

a single motion for the purpose of determining the appropriate filing fee, but
memorandums, declarations, and other supporting papers must be filed only in
the lowest numbered case; 
“(B)  Must be
served on all attorneys of record and all nonrepresented parties in all of the
cases sought to be consolidated; and

and heard after the cases, initially filed in different departments, have been
related into a single department, or if the cases were already assigned to that
department. (2) Upon consolidation of cases, the first filed case will be the
lead case, unless otherwise ordered by the court. After consolidation, all
future papers to be filed in the consolidated case must be filed only in the
case designated as the lead case. (3) Before consolidation of a limited case
with an unlimited case, the limited case must be reclassified as an unlimited
case and the reclassification fee paid.”
