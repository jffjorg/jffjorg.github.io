LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.610 provides: 
“(a) Once any party has taken the deposition of any
natural person, including that of a party to the action, neither the party who
gave, nor any other party who has been served with a deposition notice pursuant
to Section 2025.240 may take a subsequent deposition of that deponent. 
“(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), for good cause
shown, the court may grant leave to take a subsequent deposition, and the
parties, with the consent of any deponent who is not a party, may stipulate
that a subsequent deposition be taken. 
“(c) This section does not preclude taking one
subsequent deposition of a natural person who has previously been examined
under either or both of the following circumstances: 
“(1) The person was examined as a result of that
person’s designation to testify on behalf of an organization under Section
2025.230. 
“(2) The person was examined pursuant to a court order
under Section 485.230, for the limited purpose of discovering pursuant to
Section 485.230 the identity, location, and value of property in which the
deponent has an interest. 
“(d) This section does not authorize the taking of
more than one subsequent deposition for the limited purpose of Section 485.230.” 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.610.) 
          Code of
Civil Procedure section 2025.290 provides in part: 
“(a) Except
as provided in subdivision (b), or by any court order, including a case
management order, a deposition examination of the witness by all counsel, other
than the witness’ counsel of record, shall be limited to seven hours of total
testimony. The court shall allow additional time,
beyond any limits imposed by this section, if needed to fairly examine the
deponent or if the deponent, another person, or any other circumstance
impedes or delays the examination. 
“(b) This
section shall not apply under any of the following circumstances: 
“(1) If the
parties have stipulated that this section will not apply to a specific
deposition or to the entire proceeding. 
“(2) To any
deposition of a witness designated as an expert pursuant to Sections 2034.210
to 2034.310, inclusive. 
“(3) To any
case designated as complex by the court pursuant to Rule 3.400 of the
California Rules of Court, unless a licensed physician attests in a declaration
served on the parties that the deponent suffers from an illness or condition
that raises substantial medical doubt of survival of the deponent beyond six
months, in which case the deposition examination of the witness by all counsel,
other than the witness’ counsel of record, shall be limited to two days of no
more than seven hours of total testimony each day, or 14 hours of total
testimony. 
“(4) To any
case brought by an employee or applicant for employment against an employer for
acts or omissions arising out of or relating to the employment relationship. 
“(5) To any
deposition of a person who is designated as the most qualified person to be
deposed under Section 2025.230. 
“(6) To any
party who appeared in the action after the deposition has concluded, in which
case the new party may notice another deposition subject to the requirements of
this section. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.290, subds. (a), (b).) 
DISCUSSION 
On
October 23, 2023, C&C and Nolan deposed Plaintiff.  The deposition, conducted remotely, lasted from
1:10 p.m. to 8:18 p.m.  At the close of
C&C’s examination, C&C’s counsel stated that she had no additional
questions at that time. 
Citing
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.290 and 2025.610, subdivision (b), C&C now asks for leave to conduct an additional, in-person, deposition of Plaintiff which
would last five hours, bringing the total deposition time to at least ten hours.  (Motion p. 1.) 
To
support the request, C&C argues that:  ·       Subtracting 93 minutes of breaks from the seven-hour,
eight-minute duration of the October 23, 2023 deposition, the deposition’s “question
and response time” lasted only five hours and thirty-five minutes, leaving one
hour and 25 minutes of the maximum seven hours of deposition time available for
C&C’s use.·       Since October 23, 2023, C&C has learned additional
information (about Plaintiff’s medical condition and treatment) that justifies
a deposition exceeding seven hours.·       Plaintiff has made a demand under Code of Civil
Procedure section 998 for $7,000,000.·       Plaintiff’s counsel agreed to a second deposition
session but later reneged on the agreement.
In
opposition, Plaintiff argues that (1) C&C has not shown good cause for a
second session of the deposition, (2) Plaintiff’s section 998 demand expired
before the October 23, 2023 deposition, and (3) Plaintiff’s counsel did not agree
to a second deposition session. 
In
its reply, C&C denies that it is asking for a second deposition
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.610. 
(Reply p. 1.)  Instead, C&C
contends, it is asking to complete Plaintiff’s deposition through a second
session under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.290. 
The
Court finds that C&C has failed to establish good cause for a second
session of Plaintiff’s deposition (see Code Civ. Proc.,
2025.610, subd. (b)) and failed to show that C&C needs additional time
to fairly examine Plaintiff (see Code Civ. Proc., 2025.290, subd. (a)).  The Court denies the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES the motion of Defendant C&C North America, Inc. to compel Plaintiff
Samuel Rojas to attend a second session of his deposition. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
