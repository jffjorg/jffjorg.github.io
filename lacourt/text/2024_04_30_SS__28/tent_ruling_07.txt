[1]        Defendant
objects to Plaintiff’s declaration, observing that Plaintiff’s counsel has
stated that Plaintiff lacks the capacity to make decisions.  A lack of capacity to make decisions does not
necessarily prevent Plaintiff from stating her age and identifying a report
from her medical examination.  The Court overrules the objection. 


[2]        The Court
overrules Defendant’s objections to Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration, which is
authorized by Code of Civil Procedure section 36.5.
