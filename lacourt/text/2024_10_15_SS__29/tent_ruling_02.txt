Cypress Senior Living Investors, LP
22STCV22059
Defendant’s Motion to Continue Trial 
Tentative
The motion is granted in part.
Background
On July 7, 2022, Samvel Yeghiazaryan (“Plaintiff”) filed
a complaint against Cypress Senior Living Investors LP (“Defendant”), Buckingham
Property Management (“Buckingham”), and Does 1 through 100 for premises
liability and general negligence arising out of slip and fall occurring on July
20, 2020.
 
On October 24 and 25, 2023, Defendant and Buckingham each
filed an answer. 
 
On May 3, 2024, the Court, at the request of Plaintiff,
dismissed all causes of action against Buckingham.
 
On August 21, 2024, Defendant filed its motion for
summary judgment.  The hearing date is
set for January 8, 2025.
 
On September 17,
2024, Defendant filed this motion to continue trial. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on October 2, and Defendant filed a reply on October 8.
Trial is set for
December 5, 2024.
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 128,
subdivision (a)(8), provides that the court has the power to amend and control
its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice. “The
power to determine when a continuance should be granted is within the
discretion of the trial court.” (Color-Vue, Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44
Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide latitude in the matter of
calendar control including the granting or denying of continuances.” (Park
Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.)  
“To ensure the prompt disposition of civil
cases, the dates assigned for trial are firm. 
All parties and their counsel must regard the date set for trial as
certain.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(a).)
“Although continuances of trials are
disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own
merits.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(c).)  “The court may grant a
continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the
continuance.”  (Ibid.)  Circumstances that may support a finding of
good cause include:  
“(1) The
unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness because of death, illness,
or other excusable circumstances;  
(2) The
unavailability of a party because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(3) The
unavailability of trial counsel because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(4) The
substitution of trial counsel, but only where there is an affirmative showing
that the substitution is required in the interests of justice;  
(5) The addition
of a new party if: (A) The new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to
conduct discovery and prepare for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had
a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard
to the new party's involvement in the case; 

(6) A party's
excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material
evidence despite diligent efforts; or  
(7) A
significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case as a result of
which the case is not ready for trial.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c).)  
“In ruling on a motion or application for
continuance, the court must consider all the facts and circumstances that are
relevant to the determination.”  (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).)  California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d) sets forth a non-exhaustive list of factors that
the court may consider:  
“(1) The
proximity of the trial date;  
(2) Whether
there was any previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to
any party;  
(3) The length
of the continuance requested;  
(4) The
availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the
motion or application for a continuance; 

(5) The
prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;

(6) If the case
is entitled to a preferential trial setting, the reasons for that status and
whether the need for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; 
(7) The court's
calendar and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending trials; 
(8) Whether
trial counsel is engaged in another trial; 

(9) Whether all
parties have stipulated to a continuance; 

(10) Whether the
interests of justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the
matter, or by imposing conditions on the continuance; and  
(11) Any other
fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or
application.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).) 
“A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment
motion filed within the time limits of section 437c.” (Sentry Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529; accord Cole v. Superior
Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.)
Discussion
Defendant requests a trial continuance so that its motion for summary judgment can
be heard prior to trial.  (Ramirez
Vielman Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.) 
Plaintiff opposes on the grounds (1) that Defendant has been
dilatory, (2) that the motion for summary judgment is not dispositive, (3) that
there is no good cause for a continuance, (4) that Plaintiff will be
prejudiced, and (5) that Defendant did not move for a continuance as soon as it
knew it needed one.
The Court of
Appeal has held that when a party files and serves a summary judgment motion
that is timely under Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, the moving party has
a right to have the motion heard before trial. 
(E.g., Cole, supra, 87 Cal.App.5th at p. 88; Sentry Ins. Co., supra, 207
Cal.App.3d at p. 528.) Here, Defendant has timely noticed the motion for
summary judgment.
Accordingly, good cause is shown for a trial continuance.
The Court notes,
however, that Defendant requests a trial date more than four months after the hearing
on the summary judgment motion; no good cause has been shown for such a lengthy
continuance of trial.  The motion is
granted in part.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to
continue trial in part.
The Court CONTINUES trial to a date on or
after February 25, 2025.  The Final Status Conference and all deadlines are
rest based on the new trial date.
Moving Party is ORDERED to give notice.
