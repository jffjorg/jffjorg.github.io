 Case Number:  23STCV20355    Hearing Date:   October 15, 2024    Dept:  29 Hitabarada v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan  Transportation Authority  23STCV20355  Defendant’s motion to compel deposition of Plaintiff Noah Williams Tentative The motion is granted. The request for sanctions is granted in part Background These two consolidated actions arise out of an accident  on May 26, 2023, near the intersection of Broadway and Washington Boulevard in Los  Angeles.   In the first filed action, Case No. 23STCV20355, Francisco  Hitabarada (“Hitabarada”) filed a complaint on August 24, 2023, against Los  Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority (“Metro”), E. Cuchilla, and Does  1 through 25 (the “Hitabarada Action”).   Metro filed an answer on October 10, 2023.   In the second filed action, Case No. 23STCV24175, Noah  Williams (“Williams”) filed a complaint on October 4, 2023, against Metro and  Does 1 through 10 (the “Williams Action”).   Metro filed an answer on November 8, 2023.   The two actions were related on December 7, 2023, and consolidated  on April 12, 2024.   On September 10, 2024, Metro filed this motion to compel  Williams to appear for deposition and produce documents.  Metro also seeks sanctions.    No opposition has been filed.    Legal Standard “Any  party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any  person, including any party to the action.”   (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.)   Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the  requirements for (among other things) what must be included in a deposition  notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice  must be served.   “The  service of a deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a  party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a  party to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document,  electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and  copying.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280,  subd. (a).) Section  2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at  least three days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition  notice does not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through  2025.280. Section  2025.450, subdivision (a), provides: “If,  after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,  director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization  that is a party under Section 2025.230, without  having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for  examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document,  electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the  deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling  the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of  any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in  the deposition notice.”   Any  such motion to compel must show good cause for the production of documents and,  when a deponent has failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a  declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire  about the nonappearance.”  (Id.,  subd. (b).)   When  a motion to compel is granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed  the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is  affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted  with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition  of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)  In Chapter 7 of  the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses  of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to  an authorized method of discovery.”   Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery  process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the  reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result  of that conduct.”  (Id., § 2023.030,  subd. (a).) Discussion Metro  seeks Metro seeks an order compelling Williams to appear for deposition and  produce documents under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450.   On April  12, 2024, Metro first noticed William’s deposition for May 10, 2024. (Rubin  Decl., ¶ 5.) That same day, Metro served a continuance of the deposition date,  moving Williams’ deposition to June 12, 2024. (Id., ¶ 6.)  Plaintiff’s  counsel contacted Metro’s counsel to ask for a continuance.  (Id., ¶ 7.)  On June 11, 2024, Metro served Williams with  the second notice of taking deposition set for July 25, 2024. (Ibid.)  Plaintiff’s  counsel asked for a further continuance.   (Id., ¶ 9.)  Metro  declined.  (Id., ¶ 10.)  Williams failed to appear on July 25. (Id.¸¶  8 & Exh. D..) Metro’s counsel  reached out regarding the non-appearance on August 19 and requesting new dates.  (Id., ¶ 12 & Exh. H.)  Plaintiff has not provided new dates. (Id.,  ¶ 13.) The  Court finds that Metro properly noticed the deposition of Williams, and  Williams failed to object to the notice or appear.  All substantive and procedural requirements  are satisfied.  The motion to compel is  granted.  The  Court also grants in part Metro’s request for monetary sanctions against  Plaintiff.  The Court is granting Metro’s  motion to compel, Plaintiff’s failure to attend his deposition is not  substantially justified, and the imposition of sanctions against Plaintiff  would not be unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,  subd. (g)(1).)  The Court sets sanctions in the amount of  $1,546.25, calculated based on two hours of attorney time in connection with  this motion, multiplied by counsel’s reasonable hourly rate of $250 per hour,  plus the costs incurred with the non-appearance in the amount of  $1,046.25.  (See Rubin Decl., ¶ 14 &  Exh. I.) No  sanctions are sought against Plaintiff’s counsel. Conclusion The Court GRANTS Metro’s motion to compel the deposition  of Plaintiff Noah Williams. The Court ORDERS Plaintiff Williams to appear for  deposition by remote technology, answer questions under oath, and produce the  documents requested in the notice of deposition at 10:00 a.m., on November __,  2024.  Metro is to provide a link to the  deposition to Plaintiff’s counsel at least 24 hours in advance of the  deposition. The Court ORDERS Plaintiff Williams to pay monetary  sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act to Metro in the amount of $1,546.25  within 30 days of notice. Moving party is ordered to give notice.
