Summary:
The judge's tentative ruling grants in part and denies in part the plaintiff's motion to compel further response to the request for production. The plaintiff seeks to compel the defendant to serve a verified response to the request for production and to produce the subject furnace for inspection. The judge finds that the defendant's response was unverified and therefore not code compliant, and grants the motion to compel a verified response. The judge also grants the request for sanctions in the amount of $700, based on the defendant's failure to respond. The judge denies the remainder of the motion, including the request for an order compelling the defendant to produce the furnace for inspection.
