Legal Standard
“Any
party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any
person, including any party to the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the
requirements for (among other things) what must be included in a deposition
notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice
must be served.  
“The
service of a deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a
party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and
copying.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280,
subd. (a).)
Section
2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at
least three days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition
notice does not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through
2025.280.
Section
2025.450, subdivision (a), provides:
“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the
action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization
that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  
Any
such motion to compel must show good cause for the production of documents and,
when a deponent has failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.”  (Id.,
subd. (b).)  
When
a motion to compel is granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses
of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to
an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Id., § 2023.030,
subd. (a).)
Discussion
Plaintiff
seeks an order compelling Defendant to appear for deposition under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2025.450.
 
Plaintiff
sent two emails to Defendant to schedule Defendant’s deposition.  (Garcia Decl., ¶¶ 3-4 & Exh.
A.)  When Defendant did not respond,
Plaintiff served a deposition notice, setting the deposition of Defendant for September
3, 2024. (Id., ¶ 5 & Exh. B.) 
Defendant responded that the September 3 date “will not work.”  (Id., ¶ 6 & Exh. A.)  Plaintiff requested, but Defendant did not
provide, alternative dates.  (Id., ¶¶ 7-9
& Exh. A.)
 
Although
no quite says this, the Court infers that Defendant did not appear for
deposition on September 3.  Communication
between counsel about deposition scheduling continued through at least September
11, but still Defendant had not offered any alternative dates.  (Okunor Decl., ¶ 3 & Exh. C.)
 
The
Court finds that Plaintiff properly noticed the deposition of Defendant, and
Defendant failed to object to the notice or appear.  All substantive and procedural requirements
are satisfied.  The motion to compel is
granted. 
The
Court also grants in part Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against Defendant.  The Court is granting Plaintiff’s motion to
compel, Defendant’s failure to attend the deposition (or even offer alternative
dates) is not substantially justified, and the imposition of sanctions against Defendant
would not be unjust.  
The
Court sets sanctions in the amount of $560, calculated based on two hours of
attorney time in connection with the motion, multiplied by a reasonable hourly
rate of $250 for work of this nature, plus a $60 filing fee.  (See Garcia Decl., ¶ 10.)
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel the
deposition of Defendant Diana Rodriguez Suastegui.
The Court ORDERS Defendant to appear for deposition by
remote technology and answer questions under oath at 10:00 a.m., on October __,
2024.  Plaintiff is to provide a link to
the deposition to Defendant’s counsel at least 24 hours in advance of the
deposition.
The Court ORDERS Defendant Diana Rodriguez Suastegui and
her counsel of record the Law Offices of Scott C. Stratman, jointly and
severally, to pay monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act to Plaintiff
(through Plaintiff’s counsel) in the amount of $560 within 30 days of notice.
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
