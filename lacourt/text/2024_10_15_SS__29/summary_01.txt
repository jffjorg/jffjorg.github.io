And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Infinity Insurance Company's motion to continue the trial from October 29, 2024, to February 28, 2025. The judge found that Infinity had not shown good cause for a continuance, despite claiming that it had not yet obtained the plaintiff's deposition testimony and had not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial. The judge noted that the estate of the defendant had already had more than a year to conduct discovery and bring any appropriate motions to the court, and that Infinity's request for a continuance was not supported by the record. The judge also noted that the parties had not stipulated to a continuance, and that the court's calendar and the interests of justice were not served by granting the motion.
