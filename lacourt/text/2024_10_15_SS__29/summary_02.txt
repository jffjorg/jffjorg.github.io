And here is a summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a Defendant's motion to continue the trial. The Defendant is seeking a continuance to allow its motion for summary judgment to be heard prior to the trial. The Plaintiff opposes the motion, citing dilatory behavior, the non-dispositive nature of the motion, lack of good cause, prejudice to the Plaintiff, and the Defendant's failure to request a continuance earlier. The Court has noted that the Defendant has a right to have its motion for summary judgment heard before trial, and has granted the motion in part. The trial will be continued to a date on or after February 25, 2025.
