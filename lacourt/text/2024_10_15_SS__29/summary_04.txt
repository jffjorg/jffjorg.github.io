The judge found that the proper venue for the action is in San Diego County, where the accident occurred and where Defendant resides. The judge noted that Plaintiff Jauna Ines Labariega Cisneros had alleged that all parties reside in Los Angeles County, but Defendant presented evidence that the accident occurred in Encinitas, which is located in San Diego County. The judge concluded that the motion was granted based on improper venue, and Plaintiff is responsible for taking all necessary actions to arrange for the change of venue and for paying all applicable fees.
