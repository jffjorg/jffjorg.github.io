And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro), motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff, Noah Williams. The deposition was originally scheduled for May 10, 2024, but was continued several times due to plaintiff's counsel's requests. On July 25, 2024, Williams failed to appear for the deposition. Metro's counsel reached out to Williams regarding the non-appearance and requested new dates, but Williams did not provide any. The court finds that Metro properly noticed the deposition and that Williams failed to object or appear. As a result, the court grants Metro's motion to compel and orders Williams to appear for deposition and produce documents. Additionally, the court imposes sanctions on Williams in the amount of $1,546.25, which includes attorney's fees and costs incurred as a result of Williams' failure to comply with the discovery process.
