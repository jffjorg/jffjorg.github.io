And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is as follows:

* Defendant's demurrer to the complaint is OVERRULED.
* Defendant's motion to strike is DENIED.
* Defendant must file and serve an answer to the complaint within 30 days of notice of ruling.

The court finds that the allegations of fraud, conversion, quiet title, and cancellation of instruments are sufficient to state causes of action. The court also finds that the allegations of misrepresentations and fraudulent actions by Macoy are sufficient to support a claim for fraud.

The court declines to strike the prayer for attorney's fees, as a prayer for attorney's fees does not in itself entitle the party to attorney's fees. The court also declines to strike the prayer for punitive damages, as the parties have stated causes of action for fraud.

If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, they must email the courtroom by 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
