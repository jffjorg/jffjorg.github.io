Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendant's demurrer to the first amended complaint. The demurrer was filed on the grounds that the plaintiffs did not comply with the claim presentation requirements of the Government Claims Act and that the cause of action for violation of the Bane Act is barred by the statute of limitations. The judge found that the plaintiffs were exempt from the claim presentation requirements under AB 218, which amended the Government Claims Act to exempt claims for childhood sexual assault. The judge also determined that the statute of limitations for the cause of action for recovery of damages resulting from childhood sexual assault does not apply. As a result, the defendant is ordered to file and serve an answer to the first amended complaint within 30 days of the notice of ruling.
