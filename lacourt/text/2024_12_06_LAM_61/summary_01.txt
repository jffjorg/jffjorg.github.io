  - "A reasonable hourly rate must reflect the skill and experience of the attorney."
  - "Prevailing parties are compensated for hours reasonably spent on fee-related issues."
  - "A fee request that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance permitting the trial court to reduce the award or deny one altogether."
  - "There is no cause here to reduce fees in a similar way, because despite Defendant’s argument, the staffing of the case does not appear to have resulted in duplication of efforts or excessive billings of such substantiality that a broad reduction is appropriate."
```

Summary:
The judge's tentative ruling grants the Motion for Attorney Fees in the amount of $155,178.00. The ruling addresses various objections to declarations and reviews the reasonableness of attorney fees. The court finds that the hourly rates charged by Plaintiffs' counsel are supported and that the case does not warrant a broad reduction in fees due to the multiplicity of attorneys. However, the court does reduce the lodestar by $6,876.50 due to excessive or duplicative billing entries. The ruling also finds that no multiplier is appropriate in this case.
