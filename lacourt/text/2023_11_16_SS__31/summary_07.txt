And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Roberta Scharlin Zinman vs. The County of Los Angeles, ET AL. regarding Plaintiff's motion to compel further discovery responses from The Los Angeles Philharmonic Association (LAPA). The Court finds that the motion is premature and must be continued to a new date because the parties did not schedule an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) prior to the hearing. The parties are ordered to participate in an IDC as required by the Court's Standing Order Re: PI Court Procedures. The Judge also orders the parties to continue the hearing on the motion to compel further discovery responses using the online reservation management system, and to submit a joint statement of items in dispute at least two weeks prior to the continued hearing date. The Court encourages the parties to meet and confer to resolve outstanding issues and believes that the hearing on the motion may not be necessary if the parties are able to reach an agreement.
