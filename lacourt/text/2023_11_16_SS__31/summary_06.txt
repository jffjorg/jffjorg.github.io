significant_statements:
  - The Court is not persuaded by the argument that a public entity may be charged with actual or constructive notice of a dangerous condition based on the PCI index of a street segment alone, or that the index rating of a street constitutes a dangerous condition as a matter of law.
  - The assessments are done every three to five years, which is industry standard.
  - The reports refer to street segments and defined by cross streets; Magnolia with Catalina and Florence would be one of the sections identified in the report.
