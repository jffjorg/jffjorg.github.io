Significant Statements:
  - "A written settlement agreement is not enforceable under section 664.6 unless it is signed by all of the parties to the agreement, not merely the parties against whom the agreement is sought to be enforced."
  - "The guardian may negotiate a proposed compromise, but the agreement must be referred to the court because the duties of the guardian ad litem are 'essentially ministerial.'"
  - "As with any other contract where one party lacks capacity, or a necessary contractual formality has been ignored, the contract is voidable until the defect is remedied."
  - "Therefore, a proposed compromise is always voidable at the election of the minor through his guardian ad litem unless and until 'the court's imprimatur has been placed on it.'"
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied Aghajanian's motion to enforce a settlement agreement between Aghajanian and the minor Bostadjian. The court finds that the settlement was not valid because it was not approved by the court and that Kurdy, the guardian ad litem, has the right to repudiate the settlement. The court also notes that there is no evidence to suggest that Kurdy's repudiation is adverse or contrary to the best interests of Bostadjian. The court further states that a proposed compromise is always voidable at the election of the minor through his guardian ad litem unless and until the court's imprimatur has been placed on it. As a result, the court has denied Aghajanian's motion and ordered the parties to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement.
