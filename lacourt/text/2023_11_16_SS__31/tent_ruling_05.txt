Background Plaintiffs Luna Kurdy (“Kurdy”) and Abigail Bostadjian (“Bostadjian”), a minor by and through her Guardian ad Litem, Petitioner, filed this action against Defendants Tanner John Haynes and Alan Douglas Haynes (collectively, “Haynes Defendants”), and Does 1 to 50 for damages arising from a motor vehicle accident. On August 23, 2021, Defendants/Cross-Defendants Tanner and Alan filed a Cross-Complaint against Cross-Defendant Hamazasb Aghajanian (“Aghajanian”).   On June 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed an Amendment to Complaint naming Cross-Defendant Aghajanian as Doe 1.    On July 11, 2023, the Court granted Aghajanian’s motion to quash the Doe amendment.  On August 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement of Entire Case providing that the parties had entered into a conditional settlement and a request for dismissal would be filed no later than November 1, 2023. The next scheduling hearing at that time was a petition for minor’s compromise set for August 15, 2023. On August 15, 2023, the hearing on petition to confirm minor’s compromise was continued to September 8, 2023, and the parties were ordered to file by August 30, 2023 an auxiliary brief providing a list of suggestions on how to move forward. (Min. Order, Aug. 15, 2023.)  On August 30, 2023, the petition to confirm minor’s compromise was denied on procedural grounds, and the court ordered counsels for Aghajanian and minor Plaintiff to meet and confer on the legal authority regarding enforcement of settlement. (Min. Order, Sept. 8, 2023.) On October 5, 2023, the Court granted the petition to confirm minor’s compromise as to settlement between the Haynes Defendants for the policy limits of $250,000. (Min. Order, Oct. 5, 2023.)  On October 17, 2023, Cross-Defendant Aghajanian filed the instant Motion to Enforce Settlement seeking an order compelling Plaintiffs to file a petition to confirm minor’s compromise under CCP § 372. The matter was initially set to be heard on November 8, 2023. However, because Plaintiff only served the opposition on Aghajanian without filing said opposition with the Court, the Court continued the hearing to allow Plaintiff to file the absent opposition. (Min. Order, Nov. 8, 2023.) Aghajanian filed a reply on November 1, 2023, and Plaintiff filed the late opposition on November 7, 2023.   Moving Argument Aghajanian asserts that Aghajanian and Plaintiffs reached a global settlement of $10,000, but that Bostadjian’s guardian ad litem, Kurdy, repudiated the settlement agreement against the minor’s best interest. Aghajanian argues the repudiation of the settlement agreement was arbitrary and capricious, based on the signed release for $5,000 requiring indemnity. Aghajanian requests an order directing Kurdy to file a minor’s compromise for the amount of $10,000 agreed upon in the global settlement and as confirmed in Plaintiff’s Notice of Settlement filed on August 1, 2023.  Opposing Argument Plaintiffs provide that settlement had been reached with respect to Bostadjian’s claims against the Haynes Defendants only, and that the final settlement reached did not include Bostadjian’s claims against Aghajanian. Plaintiffs provide that the Court had granted Aghajanian’s motion to quash the Doe amendment in this matter, which required Plaintiff to file a separate action against Aghajanian in the Glendale branch. Plaintiffs’ counsel provides she advised the Court on October 5, 2023 that Plaintiffs has repudiated the $10,000 settlement placed orally on record, and the repudiation was neither arbitrary, capricious, nor adverse to the minor’s best interest.  Reply Argument Aghajanian argues Plaintiffs may not split their lawsuit into multiple filings because the Court had quashed Plaintiff’s Doe amendment against Aghajanian and that the global settlement amount of $10,000 was already accepted by the Court.   II. Motion to Enforce Settlement   CCP § 664.6 states: “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.” Strict compliance with the statutory requirements is necessary before a court can enforce a settlement agreement under this statute.  (Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37.)  To enforce a written settlement agreement under CCP section 664.6, the following three elements must be met: (1) the parties must have come to a meeting of the minds on all material points; (2) there must be a writing that contains the material terms of the agreement; and (3) the writing must be signed by the parties.  (Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 797-98.)  CCP § 664.6 “require[s] the signatures of the parties seeking to enforce the agreement under [Code of Civil Procedure] section 664.6 and against whom the agreement is sought to be enforced.”  (J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v. Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.)  CCP § 664.6’s “requirement of a ‘writing signed by the parties’ must be read to apply to all parties bringing the section 664.6 motion and against whom the motion is directed.”  (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 306; see Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Const., Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 35-37 [“A written settlement agreement is not enforceable under section 664.6 unless it is signed by all of the parties to the agreement, not merely the parties against whom the agreement is sought to be enforced.”].)  “A procedure in which a settlement is evidenced by one writing signed by both sides minimizes the possibility of … dispute[s] and legitimizes the summary nature of the section 664.6 procedure.”  (Robertson v. Chen (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1290, 1293.)   Here, in seeking an order enforcing the purported settlement between Plaintiffs and Defendants, Aghajanian submits a copy of the receipt and release of all claims for and in consideration of the sum of $5,000 signed by the minor’s guardian ad litem on February 7, 2022. (Mot. Exh. A.) This evidence is insufficient to satisfy the strict requirements of CCP § 664.6.  While the petition indicates that a release  may have been reached between Plaintiffs and Aghajanian, the release does not contain any of the terms of the purported settlement for $10,000.  Aghajanian relies exclusively on Scruton v. Korean Air Lines Co. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1596, arguing where the requirements of section 664.6 are not satisfied, the Court may still direct settlement if the Court finds the guardian ad litem acted arbitrarily and capriciously, and that Kurdy’s conduct was against the best interests of the minor.  “[T]he guardian may negotiate a proposed compromise, but the agreement must be referred to the court because the duties of the guardian ad litem are ‘essentially ministerial.’ (Ibid.) Thus, ‘[i]t is the court's order approving the settlement that vests the guardian ad litem with the legal power to enforce the agreement. [Citation.]’ ”  (Scruton v. Korean Air Lines Co. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1596, 1605.)  “As with any other contract where one party lacks capacity, or a necessary contractual formality has been ignored, the contract is voidable until the defect is remedied.”  (Id.)  “Therefore, a proposed compromise is always voidable at the election of the minor through his guardian ad litem unless and until ‘the court's imprimatur has been placed on it.’ [Citation.]”  (Id. at 1606.)  The settlement negotiated between Plaintiffs and Defendants was thus not final or binding until approval.  (Id. at 1608.)  The Court must grant Kurdy deference in regards to repudiating the settlement agreement; “... the decision of the guardian deserves some deference. Consequently, ... the court has limited power to direct a settlement unilaterally, but to do so, the court must first find that the guardian ad litem has acted arbitrarily and capriciously in the sense that his conduct is inimical to the best interests of the court's ward.”  (Id. at 1607-08, emphasis in original.)   There is no evidence presented to suggest that Kurdy’s repudiation is adverse or contrary to the best interests of Bostadjian. Additionally, there was no binding settlement endorsed by this Court related to Aghajanian and the minor Bostadjian. Without trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward's claim, the settlement cannot be valid. (Anderson v. Latimer (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 667.) Again, as previously stated, a proposed compromise is always voidable at the election of the minor through his guardian ad litem unless and until “the court's imprimatur has been placed on it.” (Dacanay v. Mendoza (9th Cir. 1978) 573 F.2d 1075, 1080.) As this Court never approved any compromise between minor Bostadjian and Aghajanian, Kurdy was permitted to withdraw any settlement agreement with Aghajanian. The Court need not, and will not, address the propriety of Plaintiffs’ separate action filed against Aghajanian here for the purposes of this motion.   Based on the foregoing, Aghajanian’s motion is denied.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 15th day of November 2023      Hon.
