And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to deem requests for admission (RFAs) admitted and a motion to compel discovery responses. The defendant, Richard Leopardi, propounded RFAs and interrogatories to the plaintiff, Dawn Stevens, but the plaintiff failed to respond. The defendant then sent meet and confer letters to the plaintiff, but the plaintiff still did not respond. The plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion to deem RFAs admitted, citing her lack of proficiency in litigation and her delay in providing responses due to being out of town. The judge denied the motion to deem RFAs admitted, finding it unwarranted at this time. The judge also denied the motions to compel discovery responses, finding that the plaintiff is actively participating in the discovery process and intends to file a motion for protective order regarding the discovery requests.

The judge did impose sanctions on the plaintiff, ordering her to pay $490 to the defendant within 20 days. The judge also awarded the defendant $430 in attorney fees for the motion to deem RFAs admitted. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement before the hearing, and if necessary, to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
