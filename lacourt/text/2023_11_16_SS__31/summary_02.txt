This tentative ruling grants the motion of the Plaintiffs' attorney, Michael B. Daurio, to be relieved as counsel in the case of Salvador Elizarraras, et al. vs. Dhoor Gurpreet Singh, et al. (Case No. 19STCV02913). The motion was unopposed, and the Judge, Hon. Michelle C.

The Judge noted that there is sufficient time for the Plaintiffs to seek new counsel or prepare for trial, which is currently set for March 19, 2024. The ruling is effective upon filing proof of service of the final order.
