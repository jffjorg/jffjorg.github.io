And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the application for good faith determination of a settlement agreement between Gama and Plaintiff. The settlement agreement was for $15,000, and Gama is seeking a declaration that the settlement was made in good faith. Anguino, one of the defendants, is opposing the application and arguing that the settlement was not made in good faith.

The judge has analyzed the factors set forth in Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, and has found that the settlement is reasonable. The judge has considered the following factors:

1. The rough approximation of Plaintiff's total recovery and Gama's proportionate liability: The judge has found that Gama's potential liability is approximately 25% of Plaintiff's known medical expenses of $60,000, which is a reasonable proportion.
2. The amount paid in settlement: The judge has found that the settlement amount of $15,000 is a reasonable amount in relation to Gama's potential liability.
3. The allocation of settlement proceeds among defendants: The judge has found that the settlement proceeds were allocated fairly among the defendants.
4. The recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than he would if he were found liable after a trial: The judge has found that Gama's settlement is a reasonable compromise given the uncertainty of the trial outcome.
5. The financial conditions and insurance policy limits of settling defendants: The judge has found that Gama's insurance policy limit of $15,000 is a reasonable limit given his financial situation.
6. The existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct: The judge has found that there is no evidence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct in this case.

Based on these factors, the judge has found that the settlement was made in good faith and has granted Gama's application for good faith determination.
