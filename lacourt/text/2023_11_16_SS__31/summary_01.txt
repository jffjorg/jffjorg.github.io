And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition to approve the compromise of pending action of minor Mordekai Lindsey, age 8. The parties have agreed to settle all claims for a total of $23,000, with $2,500 going to the Claimant. The court finds the settlement and attorneys' fees fair and reasonable. However, the petition is incomplete because the Petitioner failed to sign the document. The court is granting the petition conditionally, effective upon filing the properly signed document. The court will set a hearing to review proof of deposit if the issue is not resolved before the scheduled hearing date.
