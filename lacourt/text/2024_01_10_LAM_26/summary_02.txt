And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to be relieved as counsel of record filed by M. Lawrence Lallande (Counsel) on behalf of his client, Samuel Castorena (Client). The judge notes that Counsel has failed to use the mandatory judicial council forms, specifically the Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel--Civil (form MC-052) and the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel--Civil (form MC-053). However, the judge finds that this failure is a minor defect and will not itself warrant denial of the motion.

The judge is inclined to grant the motion, but will not do so until Counsel has lodged with the Court a proposed order on Judicial Council form MC-053. The proposed order must contain certain information, including Client's current mailing address for service, email address, and phone number, as well as a list of all upcoming hearings and the address of the Court.

The judge orders Counsel to electronically file and email a proposed order at or before the hearing on this motion. If Counsel does so, the motion to be relieved as counsel will be granted. Otherwise, the motion will be denied without prejudice.
