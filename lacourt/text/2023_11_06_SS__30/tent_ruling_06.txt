 Case Number:  21STCV24959    Hearing Date:   November 6, 2023    Dept:  30 L.W. A MINOR, BY AND THROUGH HIS GUARDIAN AD LITEM, CRISTYN MARTIN vs THE HELP GROUP WEST, et al.Petition to Confirm Minor's Compromise with Special Needs TrustTENTATIVEThe Court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call.The Court has reviewed the Petition to Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim of a Minor (L.W., Age 13). The Court finds the settlement is reasonable, however the following issues preclude the granting of the petition at this time:(1) When seeking approval of a special needs trust (SNT), notice of the hearing and service of the petition must be made upon three state agencies including the Dept. of Mental Health, Dept. of Developmental Services, and Dept. of Health Care Services. (Probate Code sections 3602(f), 3611(c).) Here, the notice is deficient. There needs to be 15 days’ mailed notice with copy of petition to the three state agencies; there was only 10 days’ notice. Moreover, Petitioner only served one of the state agencies (Dept. of Heart Care Services), and not all three.(2) The Court needs a copy of the completed but unexecuted Joinder Agreement by which plaintiff would participate in the pooled Special Needs Trust (SNT) (which provides the remainder of terms of the trust as to plaintiff). Thus, the trust analysis is not possible.Accordingly, the petition is CONTINUED to an appearance hearing in 60 days. Counsel is ordered to provide all three state agencies with timely service and file proof of service, and file a copy of the completed but unexecuted Joinder Agreement by which plaintiff would participate in the pooled SNT.Moving party is ordered to give notice.
