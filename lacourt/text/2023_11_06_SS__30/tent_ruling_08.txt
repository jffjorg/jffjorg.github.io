 Case Number:  22STCV05113    Hearing Date:   November 6, 2023    Dept:  30 TONY A HADLEY vs IN-N-OUT BURGERSMotion for Terminating SanctionsTENTATIVEDefendant’s motion for terminating or issue sanctions is CONTINUED 30 days to allow Plaintiff one final opportunity to respond to ALL of the discovery orders at issue, e.g., the orders from June 20, 2023, and July 3, 2023. Plaintiff is ORDERED to comply with all of the discovery orders seven (7) days before the continued hearing date on this motion.  Defendant is ordered to file a declaration 5 days before the continued hearing date informing the Court as to whether Plaintiff complied.  Moving party to give notice.DISCUSSIONOn June 20, 2023, this Court granted Defendant’s motions to compel Plaintiff to provide further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Form Interrogatories, Set One, ordered Plaintiff to respond in 20 days, and imposed sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $700. (6/20/2023 Minute Order.) Defendant gave notice of the Court ruling the next day. (6/22/23 Notice of Ruling.)On July 3, 2023, this Court granted Defendant’s motions to compel Plaintiff to provide responses to request for production of documents, set one, and to deem admissions admitted, and imposed monetary sanctions in the amount of $533.95. The Court ordered Plaintiff to provide responses to the request for production within 20 days. (7/3/23 Minute Order.) Defendant gave Plaintiff notice of the Court ruling on July 10, 2023. (7/10/23 Notice of Ruling.)After placing several unreturned calls to, and leaving several unreturned voicemail messages for Plaintiff, on July 12, 2023, Defendant sent email correspondence to Plaintiff not only attaching the four notices of ruling on the Discovery Motions, but explaining that Plaintiff’s supplemental responses to Form Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories were past-due. (Watts Decl. ¶ 10; Exh. 1.) Plaintiff never responded to this email. (Id.) Defendant attempted to meet and confer again to no avail.Despite the Court orders, Plaintiff has failed to comply with the Court's discovery orders or pay sanctions. (Watts Decl. ¶ 12.)The Court notes that whether Plaintiff complied with the Court’s order to pay monetary sanctions is not relevant to the determination of whether terminating sanctions¿should be imposed. A court may not issue a terminating sanction for failure to pay a monetary discovery sanction. ¿(Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 610, 615.)¿ A monetary sanction order is enforceable as a money judgment under the Enforcement of Judgments Law, CCP §§680.010, et seq. (Id. at 615.)However, Plaintiff has been engaging in conduct that is an abuse of the discovery process by violating the discovery statutes, and failing to comply with multiple Court orders compelling his responses. Moreover, Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to indicate he will comply with these discovery obligations, or explain his failure to comply with the Court’s discovery orders to show he did not willfully disobey the orders. Nevertheless, Plaintiff did file a request for a 30–60-day extension to respond to the discovery with the Court on July 17, 2023. As a result, it appears Plaintiff is attempting to comply with the orders. Thus, the Court will allow Plaintiff one final opportunity to respond to ALL of the discovery orders at issue, e.g., the orders from June 20, 2023 and July 3, 2023. The Court will therefore continue this hearing.
