```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Defendant's motion to compel supplemental request for production of documents as moot, since the Plaintiff has already produced verified responses. The Judge also denies the Defendant's request for sanctions, as the motion was not unsuccessfully opposed. The Court will give notice to the moving party. The Defendant had propounded the supplemental request for production on May 15, 2023, but the Plaintiff failed to provide any responses, despite acknowledgment of the delay by Plaintiff's counsel. The Plaintiff finally produced verified responses on October 30, 2023, rendering the motion to compel moot.
