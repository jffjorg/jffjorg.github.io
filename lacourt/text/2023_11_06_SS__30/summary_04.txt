And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Maria Rodriguez, has filed a motion to set aside the dismissal of her action against Pacific Bay, Inc. and others. The action was dismissed on February 1, 2023, due to the plaintiff's nonappearance at a hearing. The plaintiff's counsel claims that the nonappearance was an inadvertent calendaring error and that the dismissal was therefore improper. The court has reviewed the motion and has determined that the dismissal should be set aside. The court has granted the plaintiff's motion and has ordered that notice be given to the parties involved.
