And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the petition to confirm the minor's compromise with a special needs trust. The judge finds the settlement to be reasonable, but there are two issues that prevent the granting of the petition at this time. First, the notice of the hearing and service of the petition were deficient because they did not provide the required 15 days' notice to three state agencies. Second, the judge has not received a copy of the completed but unexecuted Joinder Agreement, which is necessary to complete the trust analysis. As a result, the petition is continued to an appearance hearing in 60 days. The moving party is ordered to provide timely service to the state agencies and file proof of service, and the completed Joinder Agreement must be filed.
