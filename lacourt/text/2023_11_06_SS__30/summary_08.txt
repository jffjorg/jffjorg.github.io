And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for terminating sanctions filed by IN-N-OUT BURGERS against TONY A HADLEY. The defendant has been seeking sanctions due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with several discovery orders. The court has previously ordered the plaintiff to respond to discovery requests, but the plaintiff has failed to do so. The defendant has attempted to meet and confer with the plaintiff, but the plaintiff has not responded. The court is giving the plaintiff one final opportunity to respond to the discovery orders at issue, and the hearing date has been continued 30 days. The plaintiff is ordered to comply with all discovery orders seven days before the continued hearing date, and the defendant is ordered to file a declaration five days before the continued hearing date indicating whether the plaintiff has complied.
