And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling continues the Defendant's motion for terminating sanctions to 60 days to allow the Plaintiff's counsel one final opportunity to cooperate with the defense counsel and set up the Plaintiff's remote deposition in prison. The Plaintiff is ordered to provide a declaration 5 days before the continued hearing date informing the Court as to whether the Plaintiff has complied. If the Plaintiff's counsel fails to cooperate, the Court is inclined to grant the motion and impose terminating sanctions dismissing the case. The unusual circumstances of the deposition inform the Court to grant one final continuance.
