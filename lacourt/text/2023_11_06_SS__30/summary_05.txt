The tentative ruling grants the Defendant's Request for Production of Documents and orders the Plaintiff to serve verified responses without objections within 20 days. The request for sanctions is denied since the motion is unopposed. The Defendant served the Request for Production of Documents on August 29, 2023, but the Plaintiff has not responded to date. The Court cites California Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300(a), which states that a party who fails to serve a timely response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling waives any objection to the demand.
