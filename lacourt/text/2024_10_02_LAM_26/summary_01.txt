And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant claims that Assembly Bill No. 218 (AB 218), which provided a three-year window for childhood-sexual-assault claims against public entities, is an unconstitutional gift of public funds prohibited by Article XVI, Section 6 of the California Constitution. The judge has denied the defendant's motion, citing the California Court of Appeal's holding that AB 218 does not constitute an unconstitutional gift of public funds in the case of West Contra Costa Unified School District v. Superior Court. The judge has also noted that the decision in West Contra Costa Unified School District v. Superior Court is binding on this Court, and has not addressed the defendant's arguments regarding the case.
