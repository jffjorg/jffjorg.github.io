And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case, setting forth their thoughts on the dispute. The Defendants have demurred to the Plaintiffs' Ninth and Eleventh Causes of Action, alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress and violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act, respectively. The Plaintiffs have agreed to amend the Eleventh Cause of Action to plead a disparate-impact FEHA claim, which renders the Defendants' demurrer to that cause of action moot. The Defendants have also moved to strike the Plaintiffs' claim for punitive damages and related allegations, as well as the prayer for tax-neutralization damages. The Plaintiffs have agreed to remove the prayer for tax-neutralization damages, which makes the motion to strike that prayer moot.

The Judge finds that the Plaintiffs' allegations, accepted as true, are sufficient to support both the cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress and the request for punitive damages. The Judge notes that a reasonable jury could find outrageous conduct by the Defendants, intention to cause or reckless disregard of the probability of causing emotional distress, severe emotional distress on the part of the Plaintiffs, and actual and proximate causation of such emotional distress.

The Judge also finds that the Plaintiffs have adequately pleaded their claims, citing California Civil Code § 3294, which allows for punitive damages where the lessor or agent has been guilty of fraud, oppression, or malice. The Judge rejects the Defendants' argument that the use of the word "guilty" in that statute requires a finding of guilt in a criminal proceeding.

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Defendants' demurrer and motion to strike, and sets the case for a hearing on October 2, 2024.
