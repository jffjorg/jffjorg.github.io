And here is the English-text summary:

Judge Teresa A. Beaudet issued a tentative ruling denying, without prejudice, Plaintiff Briand WMS Esquire's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The motion was unopposed, but the Court found that Plaintiff failed to comply with certain procedural requirements set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324. Specifically, the proposed Second Amended Complaint did not clearly specify which allegations were proposed to be deleted or added, and the supporting declaration did not provide the required information. The Court emphasized the strong policy favoring amendment, but ultimately denied the motion due to the lack of compliance with procedural requirements. Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
