[1]The Court notes
that the caption page of Petitioner’s amended notice of hearing filed on
January 29, 2024 references a “First Amended Petition.” However, a First
Amended Petition was not filed in this action until 2/26/24, two days before
this hearing; that filing is untimely. Thus, for purposes of this motion, the
operative petition is the Petition for Approval of Transfer of Structured
Settlement Payment Rights filed on December 26, 2023.
