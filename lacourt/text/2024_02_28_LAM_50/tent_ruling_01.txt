[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:
 
MOTION TO
  CONTINUE TRIAL DATE OR ADVANCE HEARING DATE FOR MOTION FOR SUMMARY
  ADJUDICATION
 




 
Background
Plaintiff
Aaron Marzwell filed this action on March 4, 2021 against a number of
defendants. On February 28, 2023, Plaintiffs Aaron Marzwell,
Roey Marzwell, Annette Marzwell, and Leo Marzwell filed the operative First
Amended Complaint, alleging causes of action for (1) damages for trespass and
injunction and (2) intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
The
trial date in this action is currently set for April 17, 2024. In addition, on
January 4, 2024, Defendants Guillermo Garcia, Ana Maria Garcia,
Leslie Hererra, Reina Estrada, Maria Ponce de Leon, and Maria Xocoy
(collectively, “Defendants”) filed a motion for summary judgment, or in the
alternative, summary adjudication, which is set for hearing on May 28,
2024.  
Defendants now move for an order continuing the April 17, 2024 trial
date, or advancing the hearing date for the motion for summary judgment, or, in
the alternative, summary adjudication, currently scheduled to be heard on May
28, 2024. The motion is unopposed and it is now moot based upon the Order
granted in response to Plaintiff’s Ex Parte Application to Continue the Trial.  The trial has been continued to September 13,
2004, so there is no need to advance the hearing date for the motion for
summary judgment. 
Defendants are ordered
to give notice of this ruling.
