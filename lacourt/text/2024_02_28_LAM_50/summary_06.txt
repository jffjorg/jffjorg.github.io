And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Judge Beaudet, is disclosing her personal experience with a pickup truck that developed electrical problems 24 years ago. She and her husband purchased the truck, which was recalled by the manufacturer and dealer, and they agreed to take the truck back and refund the purchase price. Judge Beaudet is recusing herself from the case and giving the parties an opportunity to file a statement of disqualification. If any party believes that Judge Beaudet's personal experience will cause her to be biased, they have until March 8, 2024, to file and serve a verified statement of disqualification. The hearing on the Case Management Conference will be continued to May 2, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file the statement.
