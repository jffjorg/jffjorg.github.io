[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
 
PLAINTIFF’S
  MOTION TO COURT OF [sic] PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR LEAVE OF THE COURT TO FILE
  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES 
 




            
Background 
Plaintiff
Briand WMS Esquire, “individually, on behalf of himself, the
general public and on behalf of all other persons and class similarly situated,
that is, a class of claimants whose rights were violated as were Esquire,”
(herein, “Plaintiff”) filed this action on November 30, 2022 against a number
of defendants. 
On July 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended
Complaint, alleging twenty causes of action. 
Plaintiff now moves for leave to file a second amended complaint. The
motion is unopposed.[1]
 
Discussion 
Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (a)(1),
“[t]he court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper,
allow a party to amend any pleading.” Amendment may be allowed at any time
before or after commencement of trial. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 576.) “[T]he court’s discretion will usually be exercised liberally to
permit amendment of the pleadings. The policy favoring amendment is so strong
that it is a rare case in which denial of leave to amend can be justified.” (Howard v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428 [internal
citations omitted].) “If the motion to
amend is timely made and the granting of the motion will not prejudice the
opposing party, it is error to refuse permission to amend…” (Morgan v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.) Prejudice includes “delay in trial, loss of critical
evidence, or added costs of preparation.” (Solit v.
Tokai Bank, Ltd. New York Branch (1999) 68 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1448.)
A motion to amend a pleading before trial must include a copy of the
proposed amendment or amended pleading, which must be serially numbered to
differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subd. (a).) The motion must also state what
allegations are proposed to be deleted or added, by page, paragraph, and line
number. (Ibid.) Finally,
a “separate declaration must accompany the motion and must specify: (1)
The effect of the amendment; (2) Why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3)
When the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4)
The reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324, subd.
(b), emphasis added.) 
As an initial matter, the Court does not find that Plaintiff has
complied with all of the procedural requirements of California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1324.  
A proposed Second Amended Complaint is attached to the motion.
However, Plaintiff does not clearly “[s]tate what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to
be deleted, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the deleted
allegations are located…” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1324, subd. (a)(2).) Plaintiff also does not clearly “[s]tate what allegations are proposed to be
added to the previous pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line
number, the additional allegations are located.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324, subd. (a)(3).) 

In addition,
Plaintiff’s supporting declaration does not specify “[t]he effect of the amendment,” “[w]hy the amendment is necessary and proper,” “[w]hen the facts
giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered,” or “[t]he reasons why
the request for amendment was not made earlier.” (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subd. (b).) 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file a second
amended complaint is denied without prejudice. 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
