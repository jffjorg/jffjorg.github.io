And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by the plaintiff, Michael Cassell, to the answer filed by the defendant, Roger Findley. The plaintiff demurred to all 16 affirmative defenses presented by the defendant.

The judge found that the first, second, tenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth affirmative defenses were facially not "new matters" and therefore sustained the demurrer to these defenses.

The judge also found that the third affirmative defense, which concerns the defendant's alleged failure to plead "ultimate facts," was sufficient and overruled the demurrer to this defense.

The judge sustained the demurrer to the sixth affirmative defense, which concerns consent, because there were no facts demonstrating plaintiff's consent to any acts.

The judge overruled the demurrer to the eighth affirmative defense, which concerns the statute of limitations, and the fourteenth affirmative defense, which concerns waiver, because the defendant sufficiently pleaded these defenses.

The judge sustained the demurrer to the eleventh and thirteenth affirmative defenses, which concern laches and bar to recovery due to insurance payments, respectively, because the defendant failed to plead sufficient facts to support these defenses.

Finally, the judge granted the defendant 20 days to file an amended answer.
