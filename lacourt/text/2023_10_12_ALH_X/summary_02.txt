Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, JBH Enterprises, Inc., to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Perla Mageno. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant's website violates the California Unruh Civil Rights Act (UCRA) by failing to provide equal access to blind or visually-impaired individuals.

The judge has ruled that the demurrer is overruled, meaning that the defendant's arguments to dismiss the complaint are not valid. The judge finds that the plaintiff has pleaded facts sufficient to allege an Unruh violation claim, and that the defendant's arguments are based on non-binding cases and attempts to require a higher standard for pleadings than is applicable.

The judge orders the defendant to file an answer to the complaint within 10 days of the ruling.
