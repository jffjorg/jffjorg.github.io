And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies Garfield Medical Center's motion for summary judgment on the first cause of action for medical malpractice. The judge finds that there is a triable issue of fact as to whether GMC staff breached the standard of care in treating Decedent. The judge also denies GMC's motion for summary judgment on the second cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress, finding that there is a triable issue of fact as to whether GMC staff's actions caused Plaintiffs emotional distress.

The judge grants Dr. Lin's motions to compel discovery responses, finding that Plaintiffs failed to provide timely responses to Dr. Lin's interrogatories and requests for production of documents.

The judge orders Plaintiffs to provide verified responses to Dr. Lin's interrogatories and requests for production of documents within 10 days of the date of the order.

The judge denies Dr. Lin's requests for sanctions.
