RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Defendant demurrers to Plaintiff’s
complaint. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Perla
Mageno’s (“Plaintiff”) claim that Defendant JBH Enterprises, Inc.’s
(“Defendant”) website violates California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act (“UCRA”).
Plaintiff filed her complaint on January 20, 2023.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
             
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint is OVERRULED.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
            
A general
demurrer may be taken to a complaint where “[t]he pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.” (Code of Civ. Proc. § 430.10(e).) A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747.) In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or by proper judicial
notice.  (Code Civ. Proc. section
430.30(a).) The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the
complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of
action.  (Hahn v. Mirda, supra, 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Additionally, a
special demurrer to a complaint may be brought on the ground the pleading is
uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible. Code Civ. Proc section 430.10(f); Beresford Neighborhood Assn. v. City of
San Mateo (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1180, 1191.) A demurrer based
on uncertainty is disfavored and will be strictly construed even when the
pleading is uncertain in some respects. (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) A demurrers based on uncertainty are “granted only if
the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably
respond.” (Lickiss v. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (2012) 208
Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Defendant demurrers to Plaintiff’s
complaint.
 
             “The purpose of the [UCRA] is to create and preserve “a
nondiscriminatory environment in California business establishments by
‘banishing’ or ‘eradicating’ arbitrary, invidious discrimination by such
establishments.” (White v. Square, Inc. (2019) 7 Cal.5th
1019, 1025.)
“The Act stands as a bulwark protecting each person's inherent right to ‘full
and equal’ access to ‘all business establishments.’” (Ibid.)
 
            In White v. Square, Inc.,
supra, 7 Cal.5th at p. 1023, the California Supreme Court held that “[w]hen a
plaintiff has visited a business's website with intent to use its services and alleges
that the business's terms and conditions exclude him or her from full and equal
access to its services, the plaintiff need not enter into an agreement with the
business to establish standing under the Unruh Civil Rights Act.” “In
light of its broad preventive and remedial purposes, courts have recognized
that ‘[s]tanding under the Unruh Civil Rights Act is broad.’ ” (Id. at p. 1025.)
“[A]n
individual bringing an Unruh Civil Rights Act claim against an online business
must allege, for purposes of standing, that he or she visited the business's
website, encountered discriminatory terms, and intended to make use of the
business's services.” (Id. at p. 1032.)
 
            Plaintiff
alleges she is legally blind and uses screen-reading software such as JAWS to
access the internet. (Complaint ¶ 7.) Plaintiff also alleges she visited Defendant’s website. (Ibid.)
Plaintiff alleges that she encountered barriers for blind or visually-impaired
people on Defendant’s website. (Id. ¶ 36.) Plaintiff alleges that she
visited the website to browse the menu, place an order, and visit a
brick-and-mortar location. (Id. ¶ 37.) 
 
            Plaintiff has pleaded facts sufficient to allege an Unruh
violation claim. Defendant’s arguments to the contrary are unavailing.
Defendant relies on non-binding cases and attempts to require a higher standard
for pleadings than is applicable. Additionally, Defendant relies on extrinsic
evidence, which is not proper at the demurrer stage, and even submits an
improper exhibit list. “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the
evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed[.]” (SKF
Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s is overruled.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint is OVERRULED.
 
            Defendant
is ordered to file an ANSWER within 10 days’ notice of this ruling.
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
