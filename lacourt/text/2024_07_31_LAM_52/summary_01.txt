And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled in favor of defendants Steven Loeb and Rosen and Loeb's motions to compel plaintiff Victor Enright to respond to requests for production, form interrogatories, and special interrogatories. The plaintiff failed to serve timely responses to these discovery requests, and the court finds that defendants are entitled to an order compelling verified responses without objections.

The court also addressed an anti-SLAPP motion filed by cross-defendants Richie Litigation, P.C. and DRE A.P.C. in a separate action, and found that the anti-SLAPP statute does not apply to the discovery proceedings between the plaintiff and defendants. The court rejected the plaintiff's argument that all discovery proceedings are stayed under Code of Civil Procedure 425.16(g), finding that the "action" referred to in the statute is the second amended cross-complaint, not the plaintiff's first amended complaint.

Finally, the court denied defendants' request for monetary sanctions against the plaintiff and his counsel, finding that the plaintiff acted with substantial justification in relying on the anti-SLAPP statute to stay discovery.
