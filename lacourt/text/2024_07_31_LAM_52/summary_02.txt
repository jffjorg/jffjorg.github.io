And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to quash or modify the deposition subpoena served on non-party Andrew M. Blecher, M.D. The plaintiff argues that the subpoena's requests for documents are not reasonably particularized and violate her constitutional privacy rights. However, the judge finds that the categories of documents requested are adequately particularized and that the plaintiff's privacy rights are not substantially affected. The judge also finds that QTC Management, Inc. has a legitimate need for the discovery of the plaintiff's medical records to evaluate her disability discrimination claims and claims for emotional distress. The motion is denied, and QTC Management, Inc. is entitled to discover the plaintiff's medical records.
