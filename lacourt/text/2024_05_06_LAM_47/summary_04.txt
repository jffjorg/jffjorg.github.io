And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion in limine, which sought to exclude all evidence of the plaintiff's damage calculations based on speculation and extrapolation. The court found that the defendant's motion lacked a foundation for excluding specific evidence or testimony and that the plaintiff had designated a damages expert in June 2022. The court also held that the plaintiff's discovery responses were sufficient and that the defendant's attacks on the plaintiff's deposition testimony did not justify the exclusion of all evidence of the plaintiff's damage calculations. The court noted that the defendant's motion failed to identify specific damage calculations or opinions and that the plaintiff's discovery responses lacked details of damage calculations, but that this was not a willful failure to disclose. The court further held that a party who has responded to formal written discovery has no affirmative duty to supplement its responses when new information comes into its possession.
