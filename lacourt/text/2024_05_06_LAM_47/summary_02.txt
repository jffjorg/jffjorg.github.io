And here is a summary of the court's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Ford Motor Company to the complaint filed by Moayed Harb. The court has overruled the demurrer to the third cause of action, which alleges that Ford violated California Civil Code section 1793.2(a)(3) by failing to provide sufficient service literature and replacement parts to repair the transmission system of the plaintiff's vehicle. The court has also overruled the demurrer to the fifth cause of action, which alleges that Ford committed fraudulent concealment by hiding the defects in the transmission system. The court has held that the plaintiff has adequately alleged specific facts and has demonstrated a special or transactional relationship with Ford that gives rise to a duty to disclose material facts. The court has also held that the economic loss rule does not bar the plaintiff's claim for fraudulent concealment.
