And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to transfer the venue of the case to Ventura County. The defendant, Southern California Regional Rail Authority Corp., argued that the motor vehicle accident occurred in Ventura County and that all the witnesses, including the investigating Ventura County Sheriff, reside in Ventura County. However, the court found that the defendant failed to provide declarations or other evidence that the non-party witnesses in this action would be inconvenienced by keeping this case in the present court. Therefore, the motion to transfer venue is denied.
