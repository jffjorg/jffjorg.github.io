And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition filed by Petitioner Aida Sedano-Herrera on behalf of Claimant Ayhden Elijah Herrera, age 9. The court denies the petition without prejudice for several reasons. Firstly, the petition must complete item 3. Secondly, the medical records and reports do not show that Claimant is fully recovered from his PTSD diagnosis. The court finds it reasonable to award Petitioner $25,000 in attorney fees, which represents 25% of the gross settlement. Additionally, Petitioner must provide more recent medical evidence confirming Claimant's current condition. The court also requires Petitioner to complete and file form MC-355 to facilitate the deposit of funds into a blocked account.
