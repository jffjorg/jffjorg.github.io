Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the cross-complaint filed by the Estate of Slavko Ivancic. The demurrer was filed by the Cross-Defendants, Gerald Michael Fitzgerald and Susan Fitzgerald, arguing that the underlying action must have been commenced against the Estate within one year under Code of Civil Procedure section 366.2. The Court overruled the demurrer, finding that the section 366.2 does not apply in this case. The Court also found that the Cross-Defendants failed to explain their argument that section 366.2 provides an independent basis to dismiss the cross-complaint. The Court ordered the Cross-Defendants to file and serve an answer within 30 days.
