And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings filed by Defendants Cynthia Flores, Kaveh Elihu, and Employee Justice Legal Group, PC. The case is stayed pending arbitration, and a status conference is set for December 5, 2024. The ruling is based on the existence of a written arbitration agreement between the parties, which covers a fee dispute between the Plaintiff and Flores. The Defendants have met all the necessary requirements to support a successful motion, and the Plaintiff has not opposed the motion. The Judge finds that the arbitration agreement is valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, and that the Plaintiff's refusal to arbitrate the controversy affirmatively establishes the Defendant's refusal to arbitrate.
