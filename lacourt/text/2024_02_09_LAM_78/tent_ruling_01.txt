Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories and Special InterrogatoriesIf a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any objection to the interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied:(1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240.(2) The party's failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)Here, Plaintiff propounded the first set of form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents on July 7, 2023. (Decl. Consoli-Tiensvold, ¶ 6, Ex. B.) Plaintiff subsequently extended the deadline to respond to September 8, 2023. (Decl. Consoli-Tiensvold, ¶7.) Plaintiff then again extended the deadline to September 29, 2023. (Decl. Consoli-Tiensvold, ¶ 8.) On November 13, 2023, Plaintiff extended the deadline to November 23, 2023. (Decl. Consoli-Tiensvold, ¶ 9.) On January 29, 2024, Defendant served written responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. (Reply Decl. Consoli-Tiensvold, ¶ 4, Ex. 3 to Ex. 6.) These responses are unverified and contain objections.Because the responses Defendant served are untimely and because Defendant has not moved for relief on the grounds of result, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, Defendant has waived any objection to the interrogatories. Plaintiff’s motion is granted, and Defendant must serve verified responses, without objections, within 20 days of this order. Sanctions are mandatory in connection with motions to compel responses to interrogatories against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel unless the court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)Here, the Court does not find that Defendant acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. Plaintiff’s counsel requests attorney fees for 15 hours of work at $565.00 per hour and 1 hour of work at $925 per hour. (Decl. Consoli-Tiensvold, ¶ 11.)  Plaintiff does not state the amount of time she spent on each of the four motions. Because of the straightforward nature of the motions, the Court awards four hours of attorney time at $565 per hour for a total of $2,260.00. II. Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Production of DocumentsIf a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling fails to serve a timely response to it, the party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied:(1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, 2030.240, and 2031.280.(2) The party's failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)Here, Plaintiff propounded the first set of form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents on July 7, 2023. (Decl. Consoli-Tiensvold, ¶ 6, Ex. B.) Plaintiff subsequently extended the deadline to respond to September 8, 2023. (Decl. Consoli-Tiensvold, ¶7.) Plaintiff then again extended the deadline to September 29, 2023. (Decl. Consoli-Tiensvold, ¶ 8.) On November 13, 2023, Plaintiff extended the deadline to November 23, 2023. (Decl. Consoli-Tiensvold, ¶ 9.) On January 29, 2024, Defendant served written responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. (Reply Decl. Consoli-Tiensvold, ¶ 4, Ex. 3 to Ex. 6.) These responses are unverified and contain objections.Because the responses Defendant served are untimely and because Defendant has not moved for relief on the grounds of result, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, Defendant has waived any objection to the document requests. Plaintiff’s motion is granted, and Defendant must serve verified responses, without objections, within 20 days of this order. Sanctions are mandatory in connection with motions to compel responses to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel unless the court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)Here, the Court does not find that Defendant acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. Plaintiff’s counsel requests attorney fees for 15 hours of work at $565.00 per hour and 1 hour of work at $925 per hour. (Decl. Consoli-Tiensvold, ¶ 11.)  Plaintiff does not state the amount of time she spent on each of the four motions. Because of the straightforward nature of the motion, the Court awards 2 hours of attorney work at $565 per hour for a total of $1,130.00. The Court grants the motions to compel responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The Court also awards sanctions in the amount of $3,390.00. DATED: February 9, 2024 ___________________________ Hon. Jill Feeney  Judge of the Superior Court
