Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted Plaintiff Ricardo Rivera's motion to compel responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents (Set One) and to compel the deposition of Defendant Andrea Iervolino. The Defendant is ordered to serve further verified responses without objections within 20 days after the date of this order. Responsive documents must also be served within 20 days after the date of this order. Sanctions in the amount of $3,390 are imposed jointly and severally on the Defendant and the Defendant's Counsel of Record. The Court also awards attorney fees in the amount of $2,260.00 and $1,130.00.

The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant induced him to pay the Defendant's company a large sum of money in exchange for cryptocurrency tokens that the Defendant knew could never be issued. The Defendant has promised to repay the Plaintiff but has not done so. The Plaintiff seeks to recover the amounts owed to him.

The Court finds that the Defendant has waived any objection to the interrogatories and requests for production of documents by failing to serve timely responses. The Court also finds that the Defendant has not acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of sanctions unjust. Therefore, the Court grants the motions to compel and awards sanctions and attorney fees.
