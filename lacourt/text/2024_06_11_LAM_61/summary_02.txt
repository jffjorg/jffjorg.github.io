And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has denied the motion for summary adjudication brought by the Defendants, Executive Bankers Realty Services, Inc., Antonio Guilar, and Liset Avilar. The Defendants had moved to dismiss the 15th cause of action for financial elder abuse, as well as the prayer for attorney fees and punitive damages. The Judge found that the Defendants had failed to carry their burden of production to show the absence of any triable issue of fact on the financial elder abuse claim. The Judge also found that the Defendants had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their argument that the Plaintiff, Freddie Harris, had not been financially abused. The case will proceed to trial.
