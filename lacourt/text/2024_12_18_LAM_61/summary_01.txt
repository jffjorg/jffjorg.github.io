And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the petition to approve a compromise between minor plaintiffs and the defendant. The compromise involves a gross global settlement amount of $299,999.95, from which each minor plaintiff will receive $25,999.00. After deducting costs and attorney fees, the net settlement payment to each claimant will be $19,065.47. The court finds that the apportionment of the settlement and the reasonableness of the attorney fees are justified, and the petition is granted.
