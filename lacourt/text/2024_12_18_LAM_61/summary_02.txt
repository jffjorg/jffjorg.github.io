And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Chantal Estive's motion for additional monetary sanctions against Defendant Agustin Quiroz, and has vacated the previous sanctions award of $2,100.00. The judge found that the failure to pay sanctions is not a basis for further penalties, and that the sanctions award in the March 27, 2024 order was immediately enforceable as a monetary judgment. The judge also noted that terminating sanctions are not necessary to enforce a monetary order, and that many attorneys are unaware that monetary sanction orders are enforceable through the execution of judgment laws. The judge found that Plaintiff did not provide the supplemental responses ordered until the date the present motion was filed, and that Plaintiff's only attempts to meet and confer on this motion took place in April 2024. The judge granted Defendant's request for $2,178.00 in opposition costs, representing 4.4 hours of attorney work at $495 per hour, and modified the prior sanctions award to take into account the work expended by Defendant in opposing this needless motion.
