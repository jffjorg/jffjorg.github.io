And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel inspection filed by the defendants. The motion was filed after the defendants propounded a demand for inspection on the plaintiffs, but the plaintiffs failed to serve a response within the required time frame. The plaintiffs also filed an untimely opposition to the motion.

The judge found that the plaintiffs waived all objections to the inspection demand because they failed to serve a response within the required time frame. Therefore, the motion to compel the demand is granted.

The judge also noted that the parties have different positions on whether trees on the plaintiffs' property can be measured, and whether access to the second floor balconies should be granted. The judge encouraged the parties to enter into a formal stipulation clarifying that any view from the second floor balconies is not at issue and will not be pursued.

No sanctions were imposed on either party, and the parties are ordered to work together to arrange the inspection. The judge also noted that if the parties do not submit on the tentative, they should arrange to appear remotely.
