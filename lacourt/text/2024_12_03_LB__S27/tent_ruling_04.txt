Background Facts

Plaintiff, Evanny Portillo filed
this action against Defendant, Estate of Eileen Lafferty for personal injury
damages.  Plaintiff filed the complaint
on 1/23/24.  Plaintiff filed proof of service
of the summons, complaint, and related documents on Defendant on 4/05/24.  The Clerk, at Plaintiff’s request, entered
Defendant’s default on 8/14/24.    
 

Motion to Vacate
     Default

Defendant moves to vacate the
default, correctly noting that an estate is not a legally recognized entity
subject to suit.  The Rutter Guide, Civil
Procedure Before Trial, explains the following in this regard:
e. [2:126] Estates: A probate or
trust estate is not a legal entity; it is simply a collection of assets and
liabilities. As such, it has no capacity to sue, be sued or defend an action.
Any litigation must be maintained by, or against, the executor, administrator
or trustee of the estate. [ Galdjie v. Darwish (2003) 113 CA4th 1331, 1344, 7
CR3d 178, 188 (citing text);  Greenspan
v. LADT, LLC (2010) 191 CA4th 486, 496, 121 CR3d 118, 125;  Portico Mgmt. Group, LLC v. Harrison (2011)
202 CA4th 464, 474, 136 CR3d 151, 157—judgment against trust was meaningless
and unenforceable; and see ¶ 2:6 ff.]
(1) [2:127] Claims against estate
covered by liability insurance: But an action may be filed or continued against
the “Estate of (decedent)” to establish the decedent's liability for damages
for which he or she was covered by liability insurance. [See Prob.C. §§ 550,
9390] (By doing so, however, the claimant waives any claims not covered under
the insurance policy or in excess of the policy limit unless a claim has been
filed against the estate; see Prob.C. § 554.)
Cross-refer: See further discussion
in Ross & Cohen, Cal. Prac. Guide: Probate (TRG), Ch. 8.
(a)   [2:127.1]
Substitution of personal representative or consolidation: If an action is
brought against the estate in these circumstances, the court may (i) appoint
and substitute the personal representative as defendant, or (ii) consolidate
the actions against the estate and the personal representative. [Prob.C. §
552(b), (c); see Blue Ridge Ins. Co. v. Stanewich (9th Cir. 1998) 142 F3d 1145,
1150 (applying Calif. law)]
 
In light of the above, and in light
of the lack of timely opposition to the motion, the motion to vacate the
default is granted.  
 

Motion to Quash

Defendant also moves to quash
service of the summons and complaint. 
The proof of service indicates the summons and complaint were served on
State Farm.  State Farm is not a party to
the suit, and was therefore not proper person or entity to be served with the
summons and complaint.  In light of the
lack of opposition, the motion to quash is also granted.  
 

Conclusion

The motion to vacate default and
quash service of summons and complaint is granted.  Plaintiff must proceed in accordance with the
above-detailed law governing claims against deceased persons if she wishes to
pursue her claims.
