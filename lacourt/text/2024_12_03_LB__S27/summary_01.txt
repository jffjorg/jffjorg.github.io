And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the demurrer filed by the defendants to the third amended complaint (TAC) and has tentatively ruled to sustain the demurrer without leave to amend. The judge notes that the parties had met and conferred telephonically but were unable to resolve the issues presented by the demurrer. The judge is inclined to permit the fourth amended complaint (4AC) to stand, but is setting a hearing for January 9, 2025, to consider any further demurrer. The judge reminds the parties that they must meet and confer forthwith concerning any deficiencies in the 4AC.

Additionally, the judge has granted the motion of the plaintiff's attorney to be relieved as counsel, citing a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and the plaintiff's failure to pay invoices.

Finally, the judge reminds the parties that there is a case management conference scheduled for the same date as the demurrer hearing, and will discuss a brief continuance of the final settlement conference and trial date with the parties.
