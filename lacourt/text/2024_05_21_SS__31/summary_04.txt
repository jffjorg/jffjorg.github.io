The plaintiff, Jade Carrasco, served the deposition notices and filed a supplemental meet and confer declaration on May 3, 2024. The Judge finds that the defendants did not serve valid objections to the deposition notices and did not proceed with their depositions. As a result, the Judge orders the defendants to appear for their depositions at a date, time, and location to be noticed by the plaintiff.
