And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion for summary judgment or adjudication. The defendants claimed that their vehicle was stolen on the evening of November 23, 2019, and that they reported the theft to the police the next morning. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants abandoned their vehicle on the highway, causing the motor vehicle accident.

The court finds that the defendants have not met their prima facie burden to show that the vehicle was stolen. The court also finds that there are triable issues of material fact regarding the defendants' credibility.

The court denies the defendants' motion for summary judgment or adjudication. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
