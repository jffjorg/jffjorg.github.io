BACKGROUND Plaintiff Norma Morrison (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant PIH Health Good Samaritan Hospital, et al. for damages arising from a fall during an altercation. Andrea Walker (“Walker”) filed the instant motion to be substituted as Plaintiff’s successor-in-interest. The motion is unopposed.  II. MOTION TO SUBSTITUTE Legal Standard “A cause of action that survives the death of the person entitled to commence an action or proceeding passes to the decedent’s successor in interest . . . and an action may be commenced by the decedent’s personal representatives or, if none, by the decedent’s successor in interest.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.30.)  After the death of a plaintiff, the court, on motion, shall allow a pending action that does not abate to be continued by the decedent’s personal representative or successor-in-interest.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.31.)  The person who seeks to commence or continue a pending action as the decedent’s successor-in-interest shall execute and file an affidavit or declaration stating: (1) the decedent’s name, (2) the date and place of decedent’s death, (3) “No proceeding is now pending in California for administration of the decedent’s estate,” (4) a copy of the final order showing the distribution of the decedent’s cause of action to the successor-in-interest, if the decedent’s estate was administered, (5) either the affiant or declarant is the decedent’s successor in interest or the affiant or declarant is authorized to act on behalf of the decedent’s successor in interest, with facts in support thereof, (6) “No other person has a superior right to commence the action or proceeding or to be substituted for the decedent in the pending action or proceeding,” and (7) the statements are true, under penalty of perjury.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.32(a)(1)-(7).) Additionally, a certified copy of the decedent’s death certificate shall be attached to the affidavit or declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.32(c).)  Discussion The Court has reviewed Walker’s declaration. Walker declares that Plaintiff passed away on December 5, 2023 at Kingston Public Hospital in Jamaica. Plaintiff is survived by her children. Walker further declares that no proceeding is pending in California for the administration of Plaintiff’s estate, that Walker is the successor in interest with priority and per agreement among Plaintiff’s children, and that no other person has superior right to be substituted in the pending action. A copy of Plaintiff’s has been provided. Walker’s executed affidavit therefore satisfies the requirements of CCP section 377.32.   III.
