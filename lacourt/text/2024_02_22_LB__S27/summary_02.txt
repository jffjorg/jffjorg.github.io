```
Case Number: 20LBCV00129
Hearing Date: February 22, 2024
Dept: S27
Background:
  Facts:
    - Plaintiffs filed a complaint against Defendants for damages arising from contamination on Defendants' property.
    - The complaint includes causes of action for California Superfund Act, Negligence, Trespass, Nuisance, Breach of Contract, and Declaratory Relief.
  Parties:
    - Plaintiffs: Michael, Injin, and Nicholas Park
    - Defendants: Foasberg Laundry and Cleaners, Inc., Richard D. Foasberg, Estate of Richard D. Foasberg, Marisa Foasberg, Lynette Jean Vavrek, and JRJ Limited Partnership
    - Third-party Defendant: R.R. Street & Co., Inc.

Motion to Continue Trial:
  Legal Standard:
    - Trial dates are firm to ensure prompt disposition of civil cases.
    - Continuances are generally disfavored, but the trial court has discretion to continue trial dates.
  Parties' Positions:
    - Moving parties (Foasberg, Estate of Richard D. Foasberg, and JRJ Limited Partnership) seek a continuance of 12-18 months to complete the environmental investigation.
    - Plaintiffs have filed a notice of non-opposition, requesting a trial date between November 2024 and February 2025.
    - R.R. has opposed the motion, arguing that moving parties have not been diligent in pursuing the litigation and that the current trial date is too late to continue.
  Good Cause:
    - The court finds that good cause exists to continue trial based on moving parties' diligent efforts to complete the environmental investigation, despite delays caused by regulatory oversight and other factors.
  Additional Factors:
    - Proximity of the trial date: the current trial date is less than two months away, which is not sufficient time for moving parties to complete the environmental inspection.
    - Evidence of prior continuances granted on the same grounds: this court has previously granted a trial continuance on similar grounds.
    - Length of continuance requested: the requested length of 12-18 months is reasonable and best serves the interests of justice.
    - The issues necessitating moving parties' continuance request cannot be addressed by alternative means.
    - Prejudice to the parties will occur if a trial date continuance is denied: moving parties contend that all parties will be prejudiced to some degree if the continuance is denied and the trial proceeds in April 2024.

Conclusion:
  The motion to continue the trial is granted. The trial is continued to February 24, 2025, and FSC to February 21, 2025 at 8:30 AM.
