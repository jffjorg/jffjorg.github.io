McNatt has cited "circumstances" that prevent him from continuing representation of the plaintiff, which he claims are mandatory and discretionary grounds for withdrawal. The motion was filed on January 23, 2024, and there is no opposition to it. The judge has ordered that relief is effective upon filing proof of service of the final order on the plaintiff. The trial date remains set for April 29, 2024, giving the plaintiff time to obtain new counsel. The court advises the plaintiff that, as an entity, it cannot proceed in pro per and must retain an attorney to continue prosecuting the action.
