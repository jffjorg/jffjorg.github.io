CASE
NO.:  23NWCV01442
HEARING:

JUDGE:
RAUL A. SAHAGUN
 
#2
 
Plaintiff’s
Unopposed Motion to Compel Responses by Defendant FCA US LLC to Plaintiff’s
Request for Production of Documents (set one) is GRANTED. 
 
Moving
Party to give notice. 
 
No
Opposition filed as of December 9, 2024. Due by November 27, 2024. (CCP
§1005(b).) 
 
The Court
notes that Plaintiff’s caption improperly identifies this Motion as a Motion to
Compel Further Responses. The body of the Motion indicates that Defendant
failed to respond to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents (set
one). Therefore, the Motion is one to compel Defendant’s initial responses to
discovery—not further responses. 
 
If a party
to whom document demands are directed fails to respond at all, the propounding
party’s remedy is to seek a court order compelling answers thereto. (CCP
§2031.300.) All that needs to be shown is that the discovery was properly
served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no
response of any kind has been served. The moving party is not required to show
a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the matter informally before
filing this motion. A motion to compel initial discovery responses need not
show good cause, meeting and conferring, or timely filing, and need not be
accompanied by a separate statement. (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) The
failure to timely respond also waives all objections. 
 
Here, Plaintiff
has shown that Request for Production of Documents (set one) was properly
served on June 21, 2023. The deadline to respond has expired, and no responses
of any kind have been provided.  This
Motion was filed on February 29, 2024—approximately eight months after service
of the discovery. 
 
As
indicated above, the Motion is unopposed. 
 
The unopposed
Motion is GRANTED. It is undisputed
that the discovery at issue was served, and to date, no responses have been
provided. Defendant FCA US LLC is ORDERED
to provide verified responses and documents, without objection by no later
than 30 days from date of the Court’s issuance of this Order. This date may
be extended by stipulation of the parties. If any objections are asserted, it
will be tantamount to no response at all and will be deemed a violation of this
Court’s order. 
 
Reasonable
sanctions are GRANTED in the total amount of $1,060.00. ($500/hr. x 2 hrs.) +
($60 filing fee). Defendant FCA US LLC and Defendant FCA US LLC’s counsel of
record are jointly and severally ORDERED to pay Plaintiff and their counsel of
record sanctions in the total amount of $1,060.00, payable within 30 days from
the date of the Court’s issuance of this Order.
