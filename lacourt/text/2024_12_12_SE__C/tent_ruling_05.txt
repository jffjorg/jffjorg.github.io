This lemon law action concerning the sale of a Tiffin
Allegro Breeze vehicle to Plaintiffs JEWEL JONES and CLEMERSTINE JONES
(collectively “Plaintiffs”) was filed against Defendant TIFFIN  MOTORHOMES, INC.; MIKE THOMPSON RV 2;
FREIGHTLINER CUSTOM CHASSIS CORPORATION, INC.; and Does 10 through 10
(collectively “Defendants”) on October 6, 2023. 
 
A First Amended Complaint was filed on November 6, 2023. 
 
On November 21, 2024, Defendants Motion to Stay Action Based
on Inconvenient Forum was denied. 
 
Plaintiffs now seek leave to file a Second Amended Complaint
(“SAC”) on the basis that “one of the entities named in the original Complaint
was improperly named, requiring the subsequent entity to be named as defendant
in its place.” (Notice 2:4-7.) Specifically, Plaintiffs seek to amend the
complaint ion order to name the correct dealership—Cummins Inc.  
 
Trial is set to begin on October 1, 2025. 
 
California recognizes “a general rule of…liberal allowance
of amendments…” (Nestle v. City of Santa Monica (1972) 6 Cal.3d 920,
939.) It has also long been recognized that “even if the proposed legal theory
is a novel one, ‘the preferable practice would be to permit the amendment and
allow the parties to test its legal sufficiency by demurrer, motion for judgment
on the pleadings or other appropriate proceedings.” (Kittredge Sports Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048.) In light of great liberality
employed when ruling on a motion for leave to amend, the court will not
normally consider the validity of the proposed amended pleading since grounds
for demurrer or motion to strike are premature. Thus, absent prejudice to the
opposing party, courts are bound to apply a policy of great liberality in
permitting amendments to the complaint “at any stage of the proceedings, up
to and including trial.” (emphasis added.) (Atkinson v. Elk Corp.
(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761.) 
 
In light of the liberality associated with granting motions
for leave to amend up to and including the time of trial, the Court finds that Plaintiffs
should be afforded the opportunity to make the proposed amendment. Defendants maintain
their right to compel discovery, demur, move for judgment on the pleadings, move
to strike, or move for summary judgment. 
 
The Motion is GRANTED.
