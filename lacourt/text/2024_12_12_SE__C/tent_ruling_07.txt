Plaintiffs CLARA RAMIREZ; YOSELINE BUSTOS; GIOVANNI BUSTOS;
and LOURDES RAMIREZ’s Motion for Nunc Pro Tunc Order to Correct Filing Date is DENIED.

 
Court Clerk to give notice. 
 
This action for motor vehicle negligence was filed by
Plaintiffs Clara Ramirez; Yoseline Bustos; Giovanni Bustos; and Lourdes Ramires
(collectively “Plaintiffs”) against Defendant Juan Corona and Does 1-25 on May
2, 2024. Plaintiffs are self-represented. 
 
Plaintiffs indicate that they made efforts to e-file their
Complaint on April 25, 2024; April 26, 2024; April 29, 2024; May 2, 2024; and
then again on May 2, 2024. Plaintiffs indicate that the Complaint was rejected
each time due to various procedural deficiencies. 
 
Plaintiffs’ Complaint was not accepted and deemed filed
until May 2, 2024 at 1:56 p.m. Plaintiffs now move for entry of a Nunc Pro Tunc
Order changing the filing date of their Complaint from May 2, 2024 to April 25,
2024 in order to prevent their claims from being barred by the statute of
limitations.
 
The Motion is DENIED. Here, Plaintiffs do not argue that
their Complaint was improperly rejected. Plaintiffs concede that there were
multiple procedural issues that had to be remedied before the Complaint could
be deemed filed. The Complaint was not actually filed until May 2, 2024. The
Court can only make the record show that something was actually done at a previous
time. This Court has not authority to grant Plaintiffs’ Motion “amending” the
date of the filing of the Complaint from May 2, 2024 to April 25, 2024 in order
to avoid the running of the statute of limitations. (See City of Los Angeles
v. Sup. Ct. (1968) 264 Cal.App.2d 766, 769.)
