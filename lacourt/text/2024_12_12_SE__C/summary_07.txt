And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Raul A. Sahagun regarding a motion filed by self-represented plaintiffs Clara Ramirez, Yoseline Bustos, Giovanni Bustos, and Lourdes Ramires. The motion is for a Nunc Pro Tunc Order to correct the filing date of their complaint, which was filed on May 2, 2024, but the plaintiffs want to change the date to April 25, 2024 to avoid the statute of limitations. The judge denies the motion, stating that the complaint was not properly filed until May 2, 2024, and the court does not have the authority to amend the filing date to avoid the statute of limitations. The judge cites the case of City of Los Angeles v. Sup. Ct. (1968) 264 Cal.App.2d 766, 769 as precedent.
