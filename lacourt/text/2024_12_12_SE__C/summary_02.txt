And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Raul A. Sahagun, has issued a tentative ruling granting the unopposed motion of counsel Sanford Jossen to withdraw as counsel of record for the plaintiff, Maria Francisco Tomas. The motion was unopposed, and no opposition was filed by the deadline. The judge found that counsel has met the procedural requirements, including providing proper notice to the client. The judge also reviewed counsel's declaration, which stated that attorney Jossen was never formally retained by the plaintiff and was only supposed to serve as associate counsel. The judge noted that there was no dispute between the attorney and client and that the attorney's continued representation would not serve the interests of justice. Therefore, the motion to withdraw was granted.
