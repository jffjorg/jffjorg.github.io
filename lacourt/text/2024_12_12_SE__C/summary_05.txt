```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' unopposed motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The proposed second amended complaint has not been filed or served as of the date of this hearing, and the judge orders the plaintiffs to file and serve the complaint by no later than 5 days from the date of the court's issuance of this order. The judge notes that the court will grant the motion absent prejudice to the opposing party, and will not normally consider the validity of the proposed amended pleading since grounds for demurrer or motion to strike are premature. The judge finds that the plaintiffs should be afforded the opportunity to make the proposed amendment, and defendants maintain their right to compel discovery, demur, move for judgment on the pleadings, move to strike, or move for summary judgment.
