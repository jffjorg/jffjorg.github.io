VIII LLC v. CAMACHO TAPIA, INC. 
CASE NO.:  24NWCV02731
HEARING:  12/12/24
JUDGE: RAUL A SAHAGUN
 
#7
 
Defendant CAMACHO TAPIA, INC.’s Motion to Set Aside Default
is GRANTED. 
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
This unlawful detainer action was filed by Plaintiff MSP
PROPERTIES, VIII LLC (“Plaintiff”) against Defendant CAMACHO TAPIA, INC.
(“Defendant”) on August 23, 2025. 
 
Default was entered against Defendant on September 10, 2024.
 
 
Defendant moves for relief from default under CCP §473(b). 
 
CCP § 473(b), states that “[t]he court may…relieve a party or his or her
legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding
taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.” 
 
The policy of hearing cases on
their merits is well-established. (See, e.g., Berman v. Klassman (1971)
17 Cal.App.3d 900.) Given the liberality associated with Motions to Set
Aside under CCP §473(b), the Court finds the Declaration of Joaquin
Tapia sufficient to warrant to relief. The law favors trials on the
merits. (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 980.) 
 
Defendant is ORDERED to file and serve the Proposed Answer
RECEIVED by this Court on November 26, 2024 by no later than 5 days from the
date of the Court’s issuance of this Order. 
 
The Court notes that no judgment or writ of possession have
been entered in this case. 
 
There is a Case Management Conference scheduled for February
25, 2025 at 1:30 p.m. in Dept. SE-F.
