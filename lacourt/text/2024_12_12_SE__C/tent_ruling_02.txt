CASE
NO.:  22NWCV01596
HEARING:  12/12/24
JUDGE:
RAUL A. SAHAGUN
 
#1
 
Sanford Jossen, Esq. and the Law Offices of Sanford
Jossen’s unopposed
motion to withdraw as counsel of record for Plaintiff MARIA FRANCISCO TOMAS is GRANTED.  
 
 
Moving
Party to give notice. 
 
No
Opposition(s) filed as of December 9, 2024. Due by November 27, 2024. (CCP
§1005(b).)    
 
The
Court finds that Counsel has met the procedural requirements, including proper
notice to the client at the last known residence or business address of the
client.  C.R.C. 3.1362.
 
Here,
Counsel’s declaration indicates that Attorney Jossen was never originally
retained by Plaintiffs, and that Attorney Jossen was only supposed to serve in
an “associate counsel” capacity with Plaintiffs’ former attorney. Mr. Jossen
indicates that since Mr. Alder substituted out of the case on May 9, 2023, Mr.
Jossen can no longer remain in the case because he was never formally retained
by Plaintiffs. Where the issue (or conflict) is between the lawyer and
client(s), without implicating other parties, the court can rely on counsel’s
sworn declaration absent any reason to doubt the representations. 
 
There
is an undisputed lack of attorney-client communications. It does not appear
that the Attorney Jossen’s continued representation would serve the interests
of justice. The motion to withdraw is GRANTED.
