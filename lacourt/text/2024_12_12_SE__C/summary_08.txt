And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, Raul A. Sahagun, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of C Meza v. Food 4 Less of California, Inc. (Case No. 24NWCV01987). The ruling grants the unopposed motion of Eduardo A. Brito and L.A. Injury Attorneys to withdraw as counsel of record for Plaintiff Diana Yolanda Meza. The Court finds that Counsel has met the procedural requirements and has properly notified the client of the motion to withdraw. The Court also notes that there has been a breakdown in attorney-client communications, and it does not appear that Counsel's continued representation would serve the interests of justice. As a result, the motion to withdraw is granted.
