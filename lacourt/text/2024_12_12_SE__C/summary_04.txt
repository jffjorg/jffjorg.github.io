And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled on Ford Motor Company's Motion for Protective Order. The court grants the motion with certain limitations. The court finds that Ford's request to define affiliated attorneys as attorneys of the same firm is granted, but with the limitation that outside counsel must sign the Proposed Order prior to being given access. The court also grants Ford's request to modify Paragraph 7 to include videographers and litigation support companies, and to modify Paragraph 8 to prohibit posting confidential documents to any website or advertising them for sale. However, the court denies Ford's request to require all personnel at Plaintiffs' counsel's office to sign the Proposed Order, to remove subsection (f) which allows disclosure to mock jurors, and to modify Paragraph 21 to require return or destruction of confidential documents. The court finds that these modifications would be an undue burden and would prejudice the Plaintiffs.
