VARGAS VS HANI MAMMO ET AL
Defendant’s Motion to Vacate Judgment
TENTATIVE RULING: 
Defendant Hani Mammo’s Motion to Vacate Judgment is GRANTED.  Moving party to give notice. 
Background
 
On December 21, 2015, Plaintiff
Jorge Vargas filed this action against Hani Mammo and G.V. Property Management arising
out of allegations that gate fell onto Plaintiff causing Plaintiff injury. On November
27, 2017, Plaintiff substituted Defendant Giselle Valenzuela for Doe 1.
 
On December 27, 2021, the court
held trial and awarded judgment in favor of Plaintiff. The Court entered
judgment against Hani Mammo on January 11, 2022. 
 
On March 29, 2022, Hani Mammo,
through attorney Christopher Reyes, filed a motion to set aside/vacate the
trial judgment. The motion argued Defendant Mammo was not served with notice of
the trial due to improper service. The Court granted the motion on April 27,
2022 and vacated the judgment. 
 
On December 13, 2022, the court
called the matter for trial and awarded judgment in favor of Plaintiff. 
 
On December 20, 2022, Defendant
Mammo filed a Notice of Association of Counsel, indicating Defendant would also
be represented by attorney Eddie Damas.
 
On December 22, 2022, the Court
entered Plaintiff’s request for dismissal as to Defendants G.V. Property
Management and Giselle Valenzuela and the Court entered judgment against
Defendant Mammo in the amount of $428,753.00. 
 
Motion to Vacate Judgment 
 
Standard 
 
“The
court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal
representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken
against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy
of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the
application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time,
in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken.”  (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 473(b).)  This relief is discretionary.  
Section 473(b) also contains a mandatory relief provision
which provides: “the court shall, whenever an application for relief is made no
more than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is
accompanied by an attorney's sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any (1) resulting default entered by
the clerk against his or her client, and which will result in entry of a
default judgment, or (2) resulting default judgment or dismissal entered
against his or her client, unless the court finds that the default or dismissal
was not in fact caused by the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
neglect.”
 
Where Section 473(b) does not apply, the Court retains the
ability to vacate judgments as a matter of equity. (See e.g. Rappleyea v.
Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 981; Bae v. T.D. Service Co. of Arizona
(2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 89, 97; Orange
Empire Nat. Bank v. Kirk (1968)
259 Cal.App.2d 347, 352–353.)
 
Defendant’s
Motion is Untimely Under Section 473(b)
 
Defendant’s motion primarily relies
upon Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) to contend the judgment should be
vacated. (Mot. at 3:17-28, 7:19-8:15; Reply at 2:6-16, 4:2-4, 5:6-9, 6:19-20.)
As argued by Plaintiff, (Opp. at 2:13-24), Defendant’s motion pursuant to Section
473(b) is untimely under the statute’s express terms. Requests for both
discretionary and mandatory relief under Section 473(b) must be made within six
months of the judgment. (Aldrich v. San Fernando Valley Lumber Co. (1985)
170 Cal.App.3d 725, 736 n.3 (“The six-month time limit for granting relief
under section 473 is jurisdictional and relief cannot be granted under section
473 if the application for such relief is instituted more than six months after
the entry of the judgment, order or proceeding from which relief is sought.”).)
Here, judgment was entered on December 22, 2022. Defendant did not file the
instant motion until October 19, 2023, well after the six month deadline
expired. 
 
In reply, Defendant contends “California
Appeals Courts have heard, and ruled in favor, to uphold setting aside defaults
after the 6-month window stated in CCP 473. (See Gray v. Laufenberge below).”
(Reply at 4:7-9.) However, Gray v. Laufenberger (1961) 195 Cal.App.2d
Supp. 875 has no application here. In Gray, the court entered the
defendant’s default on March 21, 1960 and entered the default judgment on May
31, 1960. (Id. at 877.) “On September 15, 1960, defendant filed notice
of motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 473 to set aside default and
default judgment,” within six months of both the default and the default
judgment. (Ibid.) The trial court thereafter allowed the filing of a
supplemental declaration on October 27, 1960, more than six months from the
judgment. (Ibid.) The Court of Appeal found the submission of a notice
of motion within six months of the judgment sufficient to render the motion
timely under Section 473 and supplemental declarations, filed after the
six-month period, were also properly considered. (Id. at 880 (“we conclude that the trial court had jurisdiction to
consider the supplemental affidavits and rule upon the motion after expiration
of the six months’ period.”).) Here, Defendant did not file any documents
related to the motion until after the expiration of the six month period.
Accordingly, Defendant’s reliance upon Gray is misplaced. 
 
Separately, the Court notes the mandatory provisions of
Section 473(b) do not apply where, as here, an attorney fails to appear at
trial. (Vandermoon v. Sanwong (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 315, 321 (“for
purposes of the mandatory provision of section 473(b), a ‘default’ means only a
defendant’s failure to answer a complaint, and a ‘default judgment’ means only
a judgment entered after the defendant has failed to answer and the defendant’s
default has been entered.”).)  
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5
Does Not Apply
 
Defendant’s motion also includes a heading stating: “This
Motion To Set Aside Under CCP § 473.5 is Timely.” (Mot. at 9:1.) Defendant does
not cite any authority supporting this argument. Section 473.5 only applies
where “[w]hen service of a summons has not resulted in actual notice to a party
in time to defend the action and a default or default judgment has been entered
against him or her in the action.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 473.5(a).) As noted
above, the judgment entered against Defendant was not a default judgment and Defendant
filed an answer on December 1, 2016. Accordingly, Section 473.5 does not apply
here. 
 
Defendant Demonstrated a Basis for
Relief Under the Court’s Equitable Powers
 
While Defendant only expressly references
the Court’s equity powers once, in reply, (Reply at 3:23-25), the cases cited
by Defendant hold that equitable relief is available outside the statutory
procedures. (See e.g. Slusher
v. Durrer (1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 747, 754.)
Additionally, the timing and basis for Defendant’s motion is a clear appeal to
the Court’s equitable powers. 
 
Generally, “the law strongly favors trial and disposition
on the merits.” (Brochtrup v. Intep
(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 323, 329.) “Where,
as in the case under review, defendant’s motion is made more than six months
after entry of default, the motion is not directed to the court's statutory
power to grant relief for mistake or excusable neglect (Code Civ.Proc., s 473),
but is rather submitted to the court’s inherent equity power under which, apart
from its statutory authority, the court has the power to grant relief from a
default judgment where there has been extrinsic fraud or mistake.” (Orange Empire Nat. Bank, supra, 259 Cal.App.2d at 352–353.)
 
Defendant notes their prior
counsel failed to appear at all but one hearing after the court granted the
first motion to vacate judgment on April 27, 2022, despite notice thereof. Defendant’s
counsel did not file trial documents on Defendant’s behalf and did not appear
at trial. Defendant provides a declaration stating attorney Reyes did not tell
Defendant he had missed any hearings, never told Defendant about the trial
date, never told Defendant about the judgment, and told Defendant he was
preparing a deposition, despite the case having already concluded. (Mammo Decl.
¶¶ 4-5, 8, 10-14.) Defendant first learned of the judgment on October 11, 2023.
(Id. ¶ 15.) Defendant previously filed an answer and diligently filed the
instant motion less than two weeks after that discovery. 
 
Where, as here, there is
substantial evidence that a party’s counsel abandoned their client, resulting
in an uncontested judgment, the court may set aside the resulting judgment. (Daley v. Butte County
(1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 380, 391 (“Despite the general rule which imputes the
attorney’s neglect to the client, there are exceptional cases in which the
client, relatively free from personal neglect, will be relieved of a default or
dismissal attributable to the inaction or procrastination of his counsel.”); Carroll v. Abbott Laboratories, Inc.
(1982) 32 Cal.3d 892, 898–899 (“The issue, therefore, becomes whether counsel’s
conduct amounted to ‘positive misconduct’ by which [the client] was effectually
and unknowingly deprived of representation.”); Buckert v. Briggs (1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 296, 301 (“The exception is
premised upon the concept the attorney's conduct, in effect, obliterates the
existence of the attorney-client relationship and for this reason his
negligence should not be imputed to the client.”); Orange Empire Nat. Bank,
supra, 259 Cal.App.2d at 353 (“there are exceptional cases in which the
client who is relatively free from personal neglect will be relieved from a
default or dismissal attributable to the inaction or procrastination of his
counsel.”).) 
 
“The law permits a client to sit back in peace and
confidence. . . . [Defendant’s] attorneys displayed an unwillingness to either
[defend his] lawsuit or to cease representing [him], despite [his] continued
checking on the progress of [the] lawsuit.” (Fleming v. Gallegos (1994)
23 Cal.App.4th 68, 73.) Defendant’s lack of negligence and subsequent diligence
weighs in favor of granting relief. (Seacall
Development, Ltd. v. Santa Monica Rent Control Bd. (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th
201, 208 (“[Counsel] sat on the case and did nothing to represent Seacall. Once
Seacall discovered the case had been dismissed it moved within a few weeks to
set aside the dismissal. No prejudice to the Board would result from the
granting of that motion.”); Buckert, supra, 15 Cal.App.3d at 301–302
(“the trial court was entitled to conclude the attorney’s failure to advise
[Defendant] of the date of trial constituted positive misconduct within the
exception to the rule heretofore stated, and their failure to attend the trial
was the product of extrinsic surprise and mistake without negligence on their
part.”); Orange Empire Nat. Bank, supra, 259 Cal.App.2d at 353 (“Where a
client is unknowingly deprived of effective representation by counsel’s failure
to . . . communicate with the court, client, and other counsel, . . . the
client will not be charged with responsibility for the misconduct of nominal
counsel of record, providing the client acts with due diligence in moving for
relief after discovery of the attorney's neglect, and the opposing party's
rights will not be prejudiced nor suffer injustice as a result of the granting
of relief.”).) 
 
Additionally, Plaintiff failed to demonstrate any prejudice
in opposing the motion. (Buckert, supra, 15 Cal.App.3d at 302–303
(“Where there is no showing the party opposing the motion to vacate the
judgment ‘has suffered any prejudice or that injustice will result from the
trial of the case upon its merits, very slight evidence will be required to
justify a court in setting aside the default.”).) 
 
The Court finds the December 22, 2022 judgment against
Defendant Mammo is appropriately vacated under the circumstances.
