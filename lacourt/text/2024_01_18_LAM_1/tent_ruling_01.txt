Defendants’ Motion for Attorney Fees
TENTATIVE RULING: 
Defendants’ Motion for Attorney Fees is GRANTED. The Court awards attorneys’ fees in the
amount of $17,255.00.  Moving party to
give notice. 
Background
 
On September 16, 2022, Plaintiff
Kimi Kim filed this unlawful detainer action against Toni Aguilar, Norma
Aguilar, Jose Aguilar, and Abi Aguilar related to real property located at 1651
E. 42 St. #2 Los Angeles, CA 90011. 
 
On April 24, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a second unlawful detainer action against Tony Aguilar, Norma Aguilar,
Taurino Aguilar, Jose Aguilar, Abi Aguilar, and Laura Veizqez related to the
same property in Los Angeles Superior Court case 23STUD04469.
 
On May 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
third unlawful detainer action against Taurino Aguilar, Laura Velzouez, Norma
Aguilar, Tony Aguilar, Jose Aguilar, and Abi Aguilar related to the same
property in Los Angeles Superior Court case 23STUD04875.
 
On June 2, 2023, the court issued
an order relating the three cases. On July 19, 2023, the court issued an order
consolidating the three cases for all purposes. 
 
On July 27, 2023, Judge Richard
J. Burdge, Jr. presided over trial on the consolidated cases. On July 28, 2023,
the court entered a minute order ordering judgment in favor of Defendants Toni
Aguilar and Norma Aguilar and ordering the dismissal of the complaints filed on
April 24, 2023 and May 2, 2023 without prejudice. On July 28, 2023, the court
also entered a corresponding judgment for Defendants Norma
Aguilar, Antonio Aguilar, Taurino Aguilar, and Laura Velasquez.
 
Due to the unavailability of Judge Richard J. Burdge, Jr.,
Department 1 shall rule upon Defendants’ motion. 
 
Standard 
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1033.5(a)(10), a prevailing party may recover attorneys’ fees
when authorized by contract, statute, or law. Civil Code section 1717(a)
provides “[i]n any action on a contract, where the contract specifically
provides that attorney's fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that
contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing
party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the
contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not,
shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees in addition to other costs.” “Because
section 1717 only applies to an action ‘on a contract,’ the statute and its
reciprocity rules do not apply to claims for fees for tort or other
non-contract claims.” (Hom
v. Petrou (2021) 67 Cal.App.5th 459, 465.)
 
“A trial court assessing attorney fees begins with a
touchstone or lodestar figure, based on the ‘careful compilation of the time
spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney ... involved in the
presentation of the case.” (Christian
Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.) The Court
“need not simply award the sum requested. To the contrary, ascertaining the fee
amount is left to the trial court's sound discretion.” (Ibid.)
 
“The reasonableness of attorney
fees is within the discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a
consideration of such factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity
of the issues, the experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time
involved. The court may also consider whether the amount requested is based
upon unnecessary or duplicative work.” (Wilkerson
v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443,
448.) “The basis for the trial court's calculation must be the actual hours
counsel has devoted to the case, less those that result from inefficient or
duplicative use of time.” (Horsford
v. Board Of Trustees Of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 395.) “The
law is clear, however, that an award of attorney fees may be based on counsel's
declarations, without production of detailed time records.” (Raining Data Corp. v. Barrenechea (2009)
175 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1375.)
 
“As with allocation among causes of action, allocation
among jointly represented parties “is not required when the liability of the
parties is ‘so factually interrelated that it would have been impossible to separate
the activities ... into compensable and noncompensable time units. ...” (Brown
Bark III, L.P. v. Haver (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 809, 830 quoting Cruz v.
Ayromloo (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1277.) 
 
Defendants
Are Entitled to Attorneys’ Fees 
 
Due to the unavailability of Judge Richard J. Burdge, Jr.,
Department 1 shall rule upon Defendants’ motion. 
 
Defendants provide a copy of the
September 1, 2012 lease agreement between Taurino Aguilar and Laura Velazquez,
as tenants, and Gregory Im, as Landlord, for real property located at 1651 E.
42nd St., Los Angeles, CA. (Aguilar Decl. Ex. A.) Aguilar states this is the
only lease agreement for his family’s occupancy of the property. (Aguilar Decl.
¶ 2.) Plaintiff attached a copy of the Tenant Estoppel Certificate dated June
21, 2021 to the complaint in 22STUD05643, which noted the existence of a
month-to-month rental with Taurino Aguilar and Laura Velzquez (Apt. # 2) and
stated “[T]he lease or rental agreement is Unmodified and in effect.”
 
The lease agreement provides, in
relevant part, “[i]f any legal action or proceeding be brought by either party
to this agreement, the prevailing party shall be reimbursed for all reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs in addition to other damages awarded.” (Aguilar Decl.
Ex. A ¶ 23.) 
 
Defendants cite Civil Code
section 1717 in support of their claim for attorneys’ fees. (Mot. at 4:1-18.) Defendants
contend “[w]hen a tenant retains possession of real property, the
tenant is the prevailing party and entitled to attorneys’ fees under Section
1717 of the Civil Code.” (Mot. at 4:13-15.) However, this conclusion is
contradicted by the very case cited in support of this proposition. “The heart of the matter before us is
whether an unlawful detainer proceeding is an action ‘on a contract’ or an
action sounding in tort. The answer is: it depends. . . . If an unlawful
detainer is brought to oust a holdover tenant following expiration of a lease,
then the action is premised on tortious conduct (e.g., trespass), and it is an
action sounding in tort.” (Mitchell Land & Improvement Co. v. Ristorante
Ferrantelli, Inc. (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 479, 486.) “Because section 1717
only applies to an action ‘on a contract,’ the statute and its reciprocity
rules do not apply to claims for fees for tort or other non-contract claims.” (Hom, supra, 67 Cal.App.5th at 465.)
 
Nevertheless, the application of
Civil Code section 1717 does not affect the outcome here. The broadly worded
attorneys’ fee clause encompasses all litigation, whether based upon contract
or tort. (Drybread v. Chipain Chiropractic Corp. (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1063, 1072 (“This clause is
broad enough to encompass noncontract claims such as this unlawful detainer
action.”); Mitchell Land & Improvement, supra, 158 Cal.App.4th at
486 (“[S]ection 1717, subdivision (b)(2)’s, prohibition against an attorney
fees award when there has been a voluntary dismissal applies only to contract
claims (i.e., causes of action “on a contract”), and does not apply to tort
claims otherwise encompassed by a broadly worded contract attorney fees
clause.”).) 
 
All Defendants were represented
by the same counsel to defend against the same claims in the consolidated cases,
and therefore Defendants Taurino Aguilar and Laura Velazquez’s entitlement to
fees under the contract is sufficient to award fees upon the entire action. (Brown
Bark III, supra, 219 Cal.App.4th at 830.) Defendants obtained an unqualified victory and therefore are the
prevailing parties entitled to attorneys’ fees under the contract. (Drybread, supra, 151 Cal.App.4th at 1077 (“defendant[s] [were] the prevailing part[ies]
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (a)(4), and
w[ere] entitled to attorney's fees pursuant to the provisions of the []lease.”).)

 
As argued by Defendants,
Plaintiff, as the subsequent purchaser, is bound by the terms of the lease. (DLI Properties LLC v. Hill (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th Supp. 1, 8 (“After a
property is sold or transferred, the transferee takes subject to the existing
lease; this new owner steps into the landlord's shoes and becomes the successor
landlord, assuming the terms and conditions of the lease the tenant had with
the prior owner.”).) Additionally, the one-year lease term does not render the
attorney’s fee provision inapplicable. (Drybread,
supra, 151 Cal.App.4th at 1077 (“defendant’s
continued possession after expiration of the one-year term and plaintiffs’
acceptance of rent after expiration of the one-year term (which plaintiffs do
not dispute) operated as a month-to-month renewal ‘on the same terms.’”); Schmitt v. Felix (1958) 157 Cal.App.2d 642, 646 (“When a tenant
under a lease remains in possession of the leased premises with the permission
of the lessor from month [to month] after the term expires, a new tenancy is
not created but the original tenancy is deemed to have been extended.”).) 
 
While Plaintiff contends she
should not be bound by the terms of the lease, (Opp. at 2:9-26), Plaintiff does
not cite any legal authority in the opposition. (Moulton
Niguel Water Dist. v. Colombo (2003) 111
Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215 (“Contentions are waived when a party fails to support
them with reasoned argument and citations to authority.”).) Plaintiff also
notes she proceeded in propria
persona, (Opp. at 2:1-6), which is immaterial.
(See e.g. Taylor v. Bell (1971) 21 Cal.App.3d 1002, 1009 (“A
lay person, who is not indigent, and who exercises the privilege of trying his
own case must expect and receive the same treatment as if represented by an
attorney—no different, no better, no worse.”).; Barton v. New United Motor
Manufacturing, Inc. (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1200, 1210 (“such a party is to
be treated like any other party and is entitled to the same, but no greater
consideration than other litigants and attorneys.”).)
 
Counsel requests an hourly fee of $350.00. (Woocher
Decl. ¶ 4.) “The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the
community for similar work.” (PLCM Group
v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) Additionally, “rate
determinations in other cases, particularly those setting a rate for the
plaintiffs' attorney, are satisfactory evidence of the prevailing market rate.”
(Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v.
Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1009.) Woocher provides prior court
orders approving his hourly rate. (Woocher Decl. Ex. E.) The Court finds Defendants’
counsel’s hourly rate reasonable. 
 
Woocher provides a detailed description of the work
performed on the consolidated cases, which is sufficient to support the fees
claimed. (Woocher Decl. ¶ 12. See also Horsford v. Board Of Trustees Of
California State Etc. (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396 (“[V]erified time
statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are entitled to credence
in the absence of a clear indication the records are erroneous.”).) Defendants’
counsel requests fees for a total of 49.3 hours. (Woocher Decl. ¶ 12.)
 
Plaintiff summarily contends the fees are excessive because
judgment was “based on some technical grounds,” including the failure to
properly serve a notice to quit, failure to comply with the Los Angeles Rent
Stabilization Ordinance, and failure to provide an eviction notice. (Opp. at
3:11-16.) The Court does not find this argument persuasive. The hours of work
performed are reasonable under the circumstances and adequately supported. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff also contends Defendants’ counsel
has already received a $10,000.00 flat fee from Defendants for this action.
(Opp. at 3:4-6.) This argument is not supported by any authority. (Moulton
Niguel Water Dist., supra, 111
Cal.App.4th at 1215 (“Contentions are waived when a party fails to support them
with reasoned argument and citations to authority.”).) Additionally, Plaintiff’s
declaration is based entirely upon hearsay. (Kim Decl. ¶ 4 (“I heard from many
of my neighbors that defendants spent $1,000.00 monthly to pay the amount of
$10,000.00 flat fee to their attorney.”).) Defendants’ counsel avers the case
was taken on a contingency basis. (Woocher Decl. ¶ 5.) Plaintiff’s argument is
unpersuasive. 
 
The Court finds Defendants’ counsel adequately supported a
lodestar fee of $17,255.00.
 
A
Lodestar Multiplier is Not Warranted
 
Defendants’ counsel also
requests a lodestar multiplier of 1.5 based upon two factors: the contingent
nature of the representation and the fact that counsel is employed by a
non-profit organization, BASTA, Inc. (Mot. at 8:17-9:16.) 
 
“The
court may [] adjust the lodestar upward or downward, depending on the
circumstances of the litigation and counsel’s representation, such as the
following: the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved and the skill
displayed in presenting them; the extent to which the nature of the litigation
precluded other employment by the attorneys; the contingent nature of the fee
award; whether the award would be against the state and ultimately fall upon
the taxpayers; whether the attorneys received public and charitable funding for
the purpose of bringing lawsuits of the same character; and whether monies
awarded would inure not to the individual benefit of the attorneys involved but
to the organizations by which they are employed. This is an illustrative rather
than exclusive list of potentially relevant factors.” (Northwest Energetic Services, LLC v. California Franchise Tax Bd. (2008)
159 Cal.App.4th 841, 879–880.) The purpose of any lodestar and adjustment
thereto “is intended to approximate market-level compensation for such
services” and is entirely discretionary. (Bernardi v. County of Monterey
(2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1399. See also Weeks v. Baker & McKenzie
(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1171-72 (“The purpose of a fee enhancement is not
to reward attorneys for litigating certain kinds of cases, but to fix a
reasonable fee in a particular action.”).) 
 
The
Court does not find a lodestar multiplier warranted. The consolidated cases were
typical unlawful detainer actions that did not involve novel or difficult
issues. Defendants’ counsel, who identifies as “an attorney specializing in
eviction defense,” (Woocher Decl. ¶ 4), appears to have demonstrated skill commensurate
with their experience and specialty. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1139 (“a trial court should award a multiplier for exceptional
representation only when the quality of representation far exceeds the quality
of representation that would have been provided by an attorney of comparable
skill and experience billing at the hourly rate used in the lodestar
calculation.”).) While “[t]he ‘results obtained’ factor can properly be used to
enhance a lodestar calculation where an exceptional effort produced an
exceptional benefit,” (Graham v. DaimlerChrysler Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th
553, 582), the litigation in this case does not satisfy this high bar. The Court
finds the contingent nature of the representation and counsel’s non-profit
employer do not warrant a lodestar multiplier in this case. (Ketchum, supra,
24 Cal.4th at 1138 (“Of course, the trial court is not required to include a
fee enhancement to the basic lodestar figure for contingent risk . . . or other
factors . . .”).)
