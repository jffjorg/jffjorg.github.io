Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Defendant Hani Mammo's motion to vacate the judgment entered on December 22, 2022. The judgment was entered against Defendant after a trial in which Defendant was not represented by counsel. Defendant's previous counsel failed to appear at the trial, and Defendant did not learn of the judgment until October 11, 2023. The court finds that Defendant's previous counsel's failure to appear at the trial constitutes extrinsic fraud or mistake, which warrants relief under the court's equitable powers. The court also notes that Plaintiff failed to demonstrate any prejudice in opposing the motion. Therefore, the court grants Defendant's motion to vacate the judgment.
