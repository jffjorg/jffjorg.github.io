 Case Number:  24PSCV01731    Hearing Date:   September 18, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE  NAME:  Robert  Rodriguez v. Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation, et al.  Defendant  Big 5 Corp.’s Demurrer to Plaintiff Robert Rodriguez  TENTATIVE  RULING  The Court OVERRULES the demurrer to the First, Second, and Third  Causes of Action. The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the Fourth and Fifth  Causes of Action with 20 days’ leave to amend.  The Court GRANTS the motion to strike as to the following portions  of the complaint:       1.      Page 7, lines  18-19, Prayer, paragraph 1c; 2.      Page 7, lines  24-25, Prayer, paragraph 2c; 3.      Page 8, lines  203, Prayer, paragraph 3c; 4.      Page 8, line  15, Prayer, paragraph 5d; and 5.      Page 8, line  16, Prayer, paragraph 5e.  The Court DENIES the motion to strike as to paragraphs 7, 17, 19,  20, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 35, 36, 40, 41, 43, 48, and 50 of the  complaint.              Big 5 is ordered to give notice of  the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.  BACKGROUND  This is an assault and battery case. On May 29, 2024, plaintiff  Robert Rodriguez (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Big 5 Corp.  (erroneously sued as Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation) (Big 5), Joseph  Christian Perez (Perez) (collectively, Defendants), and Does 1 to 10, alleging  causes of action for assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional  distress, negligence, and negligent hiring, training, supervision, and/or  retention.  On July 3, 2024, Big 5 demurred to and moved to strike portions of  the complaint. On August 30, 2024, Plaintiff opposed both motions. On September  11, 2024, Big 5 replied.  LEGAL  STANDARD – Demurrer              A demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of  other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or  content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or  cross-complaint). (Code Civ. Proc., § 422.10; see Donabedian v.  Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) It is not the function  of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for  purposes of ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are  assumed to be true. (Id.)  A  demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the  pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially  noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian v.  Mercury Ins. Co., supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) No other  extrinsic evidence can be considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson  (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in  memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso  v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862, disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal  v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287 [error to consider  contents of release not part of court record].)  A  demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is incomplete  or discloses some defense that would bar recovery. (Guardian North Bay, Inc.  v. Superior Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.) The “face of  the complaint” includes material contained in attached exhibits that are  incorporated by reference into the complaint, or in a superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v.  Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v. Fireman’s  Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as  surplusage the pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”])  A demurrer  can only be sustained when it disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner  v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of  Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108  Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)   PRELIMINARY  ISSUE                        The Court notes that Big 5’s  demurrer violates Rule 3.1320, subdivision (a), of the California Rules of  Court by combining multiple grounds for the demurrer into one paragraph for  each cause of action. (See Notice, p. 2; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1320,  subd. (a).) Each ground for demurrer must be stated in a separate paragraph. (Id.)  The Court will still consider the demurrer, but admonishes Big 5 to comply with  the requirements of the California Rules of Court going forward.  REQUESTS FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE –  Demurrer              The Court GRANTS  Big 5’s initial request for judicial notice submitted with its moving papers. (Evid. Code,  § 452, subd. (d).) However, the Court  takes judicial notice only as to “the existence, content and authenticity of  public records and other specified documents”; it does not take judicial notice  of the truth of the factual matters asserted in that document. (Dominguez v. Bonta (2022) 87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.)  The Court DENIES Big 5’s supplemental request for  judicial notice submitted with its reply papers because it constitutes new  evidence on a reply, which generally is not permitted when it raises new issues.  (Jay v. Mahaffey (2013)  218 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1537-1538.) The Court also notes that even if it had been  properly requested for judicial notice with the moving papers, the Court would  only take notice of the existence of the document, and not the truthfulness of  the matters asserted therein. (See Wolf v. CDS Devco (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 903, 915.)          DISCUSSION  Meet and Confer  Per Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a), Big 5  was required to meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference  before bringing this demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) While  the Court finds Big 5’s efforts to meet and confer sufficient, as there is at  least evidence of an attempted phone call, the Court also notes the bulk of the  efforts to meet and confer were conducted by email. (Rogers Decl., ¶¶ 2-9.) As  a reminder, meeting and conferring needs to be conducted by telephone, video  conference, or in person. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a); Dept. 6  Courtroom Information [“Parties are required to meet and confer in person, by  telephone, or by video conference before filing any motion.”])  Uncertainty  “’[D]emurrers for uncertainty are disfavored. We  strictly construe such demurrers because ambiguities can reasonably be  clarified under modern rules of discovery.’ [Citation.]” (Lickiss v. Fin. Indus. Regul. Auth. (2012) 208  Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135.) Demurrers for uncertainty are generally granted only  when the defendant cannot reasonably respond. (A.J. Fistes Corp. v. GDL Best  Contractors, Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695.)  Big 5 demurs to each cause of action on the grounds that they are  uncertain. Big 5 contends each cause of action is uncertain because the  complaint does not specifically identify to which Defendant each cause of  action is directed and fails to allege the conduct committed by which  Defendant. In opposition, Plaintiff contends that complaint is sufficiently  pleaded because the complaint alleges details of the nature of the injuries,  the circumstances of the incident, and the direct role of Big 5 and its employee  in causing these injuries.  The Court does not find the complaint subject to demurrer for  uncertainty. The complaint alleges a set of facts regarding a physical  altercation that Plaintiff experienced with Perez, an employee of Big 5.  (Compl., ¶¶ 5-17.) These allegations are not unintelligible and are not such  that Big 5 cannot reasonably respond to them. Also, the subheading for each  cause of action indicates that they are directed at all Defendants. (Compl., 3:23-24,  4:18-19, 5:8-10, 6:2-3, 6:22-23.)  Based on the foregoing, the Court OVERRULES the demurrer to each  cause of action on grounds of uncertainty.  First and Second Causes of Action – Assault and Battery  To state a cause of action for assault, the plaintiff must allege  facts demonstrating, “(1) the defendant acted with intent to cause harmful or  offensive contact, or threatened to touch the plaintiff in a harmful or  offensive manner; (2) the plaintiff reasonably believed he was about to be  touched in a harmful or offensive manner or it reasonably appeared to the  plaintiff that the defendant was about to carry out the threat; (3) the  plaintiff did not consent to the defendant's conduct; (4) the plaintiff was  harmed; and (5) the defendant's conduct was a substantial factor in causing the  plaintiff's harm. [Citation.]” (Carlsen v. Koivumaki (2014) 227  Cal.App.4th 879, 890.) To state a cause of action for battery, the plaintiff must allege  facts demonstrating: (1) the defendant intentionally did an act which resulted  in a harmful or offensive contact with the plaintiff's person; (2) the  plaintiff did not consent to the contact; and (3) the harmful or offensive  contact caused injury, damage, loss or harm to the plaintiff. (Piedra v.  Dugan (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1483, 1495.) “Under the doctrine of respondeat superior, ‘an  employer is vicariously liable for the torts of its employees committed within  the scope of the employment.’ [Citation.]” (Saks v. Charity Mission Baptist  Church (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1138.) “’The conduct of an  employee falls within the scope of his or her employment if the conduct either  (1) is required by or incidental to the employee's duties, or (2) it is  reasonably foreseeable in light of the employer’s business.’ [Citation.]” (Crouch v. Trinity Christian Ctr. of Santa Ana, Inc.  (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 995, 1015 (Crouch).) Big 5 demurs to the First and Second Causes of Action for assault  and battery, respectively, on the grounds that they fail to state a cause of  action. Big 5 contends the complaint does not allege facts demonstrating a  causal nexus between Perez’s alleged conduct and Big 5. Big 5 notes that the  complaint alleges Perez was working at Big 5’s sales counter register, but  alleges no facts showing that Perez’s actions towards Plaintiff were required  by his duties or reasonably foreseeable in light of Big 5’s business a sporting  goods retailer. In opposition, Plaintiff contends he has sufficiently pleaded the  First and Second Causes of Action for assault and battery. Plaintiff contends  Perez’s actions were within the course and scope of his employment with Big 5,  and the complaint alleges that Perez injured Plaintiff was performing his  duties as an employee of Big 5, making it foreseeable and directly tied to his  role at Big 5. Plaintiff further contends that even if Perez’s specific actions  were unauthorized, they were carried out in the context of his employment.             The Court finds the complaint alleges sufficient facts to  state causes of action for assault and battery against Big 5 under the doctrine  of respondeat superior. Whether the employee was acting within the course and  scope of employment is ordinarily a question of fact, (Perez v. Van Groningen & Sons, Inc. (1986) 41  Cal.3d 962, 968), and a demurrer is not the appropriate procedure for determining  the truth of disputed facts, (Panterra GP, Inc. v. Superior Court of Kern  County (2022) 74 Cal.App.5th 697, 709). The complaint alleges that Perez  was an employee of Big 5, Perez began to threaten Plaintiff when Plaintiff tossed  some sunglasses onto the sales counter while Perez was working the register,  and that Perez attacked Plaintiff after a different employee of Big 5 had  escorted Plaintiff to his car. (Compl., ¶¶ 6, 8-12.) For purposes of this  demurrer, the Court finds these allegations sufficient. Based on the foregoing, the Court OVERRULES the demurrer to the  First and Second Causes of Action for assault and battery, respectively. Third Cause of Action – Intentional Infliction of Emotional  Distress To state a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional  distress, the plaintiff must allege facts demonstrating, “(1) defendant engaged  in extreme and outrageous conduct (conduct so extreme as to exceed all bounds  of decency in a civilized community) with the intent to cause, or with reckless  disregard to the probability of causing, emotional distress; and (2) as a  result, plaintiff suffered extreme or severe emotional distress.” (Berry v.  Frazier (2023) 90 Cal.App.5th 1258, 1273 (Berry).) “Whether a  defendant's conduct can reasonably be found to be outrageous is a question of  law that must initially be determined by the court; if reasonable persons may  differ, it is for the jury to determine whether the conduct was, in fact,  outrageous. [Citation.]” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518,  534; but see Berry, supra, 90 Cal.App.5th at p. 1273 [“’[W]hether conduct is  ‘outrageous’ is usually a question of fact.’ [Citation.]” Big 5 demurs to the Third Cause of Action for intentional  infliction of emotional distress on the grounds that it fails to state a cause  of action. Big 5 contends a corporation cannot commit intentional infliction of  emotional distress, and argues that because Plaintiff cannot satisfy the claims  of assault and battery against Big 5, Plaintiff also cannot maintain a cause of  action for intentional infliction of emotional distress based on the same  allegations.             In opposition, Plaintiff contends  the complaint clearly alleges that Perez, as an employee of Big 5, engaged in  extreme and outrageous conduct by injuring Plaintiff. Plaintiff contends  Perez’s conduct served Big 5’s interests by maintaining order and enforcing  store policies, even if done recklessly or negligently. Plaintiff contends  Perez’s conduct fell within the scope of his duty to manage customer  interactions, ensure compliance with store rules, and address potential  disturbances. Plaintiff also contends that a corporation can still be held  liable for the intentional torts of its employees if it falls within the scope  of his or her employment. Plaintiff further contends the complaint sufficiently  alleges Plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress as a result of Perez’s  actions.             While the Court does not accept arguments stated in the  Opposition as facts alleged in the Complaint, the Court still finds the  complaint alleges sufficient facts to state a cause of action for intentional  infliction of emotional distress under the doctrine of respondeat superior. Big  5’s argument regarding liability for corporations vis-à-vis intentional  infliction of emotional distress is misleading. The case Big 5 cited, Brown  v. Allstate Inc. Co. (1998) 17 F.Supp.2d 1134, is a federal case interpreting  state law and is not binding on this Court. (McCann v. Lucky Money, Inc. (2005)  129 Cal.App.4th 1382, 1396.) Also, the federal district court in Brown included  a footnote that said, “It should be noted that Allstate can be vicariously  liable for torts committed by an employee in the course and scope of  employment.” (Brown v. Allstate Ins. Co. (1998) 17 F.Supp.2d 1134,  1139 fn. 4.)              Moreover, to the extent Big 5 is reiterating its  arguments regarding assault and battery, the Court finds those arguments  unavailing for the same reasons set forth above. For purposes of this demurrer,  the Court otherwise finds the complaint alleges sufficient facts to state a  cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress against Big 5  under the doctrine of respondeat superior based on the actions of Defendant  Perez.              Based on the foregoing, the Court OVERRULES the demurrer  to the Third Cause of Action for intentional infliction of emotional distress.              Fourth Cause of Action – Negligence              “’To state a cause of action for negligence, a plaintiff  must allege (1) the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care, (2) the  defendant breached that duty, and (3) the breach proximately caused the  plaintiff's damages or injuries.’ [Citation.]” (Lueras v. BAC Home Loans  Servicing, LP (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 49, 62.)              Big 5 demurs to the Fourth Cause of Action for negligence  on the grounds that it fails to state a cause of action. Big 5 contends this  cause of action fails because Plaintiff admits in his pleadings that one of Big  5’s other employees escorted Plaintiff out of the store to his vehicle.[1] Big 5 also contends this cause of action is duplicative of the Fifth Cause of  Action for negligent hiring, training, supervision, and/or retention.              In opposition, Plaintiff contends he has sufficiently  pleaded a cause of action for negligence, arguing that Big 5 had a duty to  ensure Plaintiff’s safety and wellbeing while on the premises, which duty  extends to its employees, and arguing that employers are required to exercise  reasonable care in the hiring, training, and supervision of employees.  Plaintiff contends Big 5 breached this duty by failing to adequately supervise  and control Perez, despite being aware of his propensity for aggressive  behavior. Plaintiff then contends this breach caused Plaintiff’s damages.              The Court finds the complaint fails to allege sufficient  facts to state a cause of action for negligence. It is unclear to the Court  what kind of negligence claim Plaintiff is actually alleging here. Paragraphs  37 through 43 of the complaint simply make conclusory allegations for  negligence in what sounds like a premises liability claim. (Compl., ¶¶ 37-43.)  On the other hand, Plaintiff argues in his opposition as though this is a  negligent hiring, supervision, and retention claim. (Opp., 8:14-10:3.) Paragraphs  11-12 of the complaint make it sound as though Big 5 failed to protect  Plaintiff from Perez when escorting him back to the car, but the complaint only  alleges in a conclusory fashion that “the escort left prematurely…” (Compl., ¶¶  5-17.) The Court finds these allegations insufficient to state a cause of  action for negligence. Alternatively, if this is effectively a cause of action  for negligent hiring, supervision, and retention, then it would be subject to  demurrer for being duplicative of the Sixth Cause of Action. (Palm Springs  Villas II Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. Parth (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 268, 290  [duplicative causes of action are subject to demurrer].)              Accordingly, the Court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the  Fourth Cause of Action for negligence with 20 days’ leave to amend.              Fifth Cause of Action – Negligent Hiring, Training,  Supervision, and/or Retention              “[A]n employer may be liable to a third party for  negligently hiring or retaining an unfit employee.” (J.W. v.  Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc'y of New York, Inc. (2018) 29  Cal.App.5th 1142, 1163.) To state a cause of action for negligent hiring, supervision,  or retention, the plaintiff must allege facts demonstrating the employer  defendant had reason to know of the employee’s qualities that would likely harm  others. (Id., at p. 1163.)              Big 5 demurs to the Fifth Cause of Action for negligent  hiring, training, supervision, and/or retention on the grounds that it fails to  state a cause of action. Big 5 contends Plaintiff fails to allege specifically  how Big 5’s principals failed to investigate and carefully evaluate Perez  before hiring him, and how such an investigation would have made Big 5 aware of  Perez’s alleged unfitness. Big 5 contends that Plaintiff provides no factual  information about Perez’s training and education at the time or hiring or any  facts indicating Big 5’s principals’ knowledge regarding those things at the  time of hiring, nor has Plaintiff pleaded any facts that Perez had disciplinary  incidents. Big 5 contends Plaintiff has not pleaded facts demonstrating that  these actions were the cause of Plaintiff’s alleged harms.              In opposition, Plaintiff contends the complaint  sufficiently pleads a cause of action for negligent hiring, training,  supervision, and retention. Plaintiff contends the complaint alleges Big 5  either knew or should have known of Perez’s unfitness for his role, given the  nature of his duties and the potential risk his conduct posed to customers, and  contends that Big 5 failed to properly vet and assess Perez’s qualifications. Plaintiff  contends the complaint asserts that Big 5 failed to adequately train Perez,  negligently supervised him, and retained him despite his observable behaviors.              The Court finds the complaint fails to allege facts  stating a cause of action for negligent hiring, training, supervision, and/or  retention. The complaint only alleges in a conclusory fashion that Big 5 had  acknowledged “the problematic nature of [Perez], who had been causing issues  for customers.” (Compl., ¶ 7.) The complaint does not allege any facts  demonstrating what those issues were. The only incident at issue demonstrating  Perez’s allegedly problematic behavior is this one incident. (Compl., ¶ 10.) The  complaint does not allege any facts demonstrating that Big 5 knew or had reason  to know of Perez’s problematic behavior at the time of the incident in  question. (See Compl., ¶¶ 5-17.)              Based on the foregoing, the Court SUSTAINS the demurrer  to the Fifth Cause of Action with 20 days’ leave to amend.   LEGAL  STANDARD – Motion to Strike              “Any party, within the time allowed to  respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole  or any part thereof, but this time limitation shall not apply to motions  specified in subdivision (e).” (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(2).)  “The court may, upon a motion made pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in  its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper: (a) Strike out any  irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (b) Strike out all or any  part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of  this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.” (Id., § 436.)  REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE –  Motion to Strike              The Court GRANTS  Big 5’s initial request for judicial notice submitted with its moving papers. (Evid. Code,  § 452, subd. (d).) However, the Court  takes judicial notice only as to “the existence, content and authenticity of  public records and other specified documents”; it does not take judicial notice  of the truth of the factual matters asserted in that document. (Dominguez v. Bonta (2022) 87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.)  The Court DENIES Big 5’s supplemental request for  judicial notice submitted with its reply papers because it constitutes new  evidence on a reply, which generally is not permitted when it raises new  issues. (Jay v. Mahaffey (2013)  218 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1537-1538.) The Court also notes that even if it had been  properly requested for judicial notice with the moving papers, the Court would  only take notice of the existence of the document, and not the truthfulness of  the matters asserted therein. (See Wolf v. CDS Devco (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 903, 915.)         DISCUSSION  Meet and Confer  Per Code of Civil Procedure section 435.5, subdivision (a), Big 5  was required to meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference  before bringing this demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5, subd. (a).) While the  Court finds Pomona Valley’s efforts to meet and confer sufficient, as there is  at least evidence of an attempted phone call, the Court also notes the bulk of  the efforts to meet and confer were conducted by email. (Rogers Decl., ¶¶ 2-9.)  As a reminder, meeting and conferring needs to be conducted by telephone, video  conference, or in person. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5, subd. (a); Dept. 6  Courtroom Information [“Parties are required to meet and confer in person, by  telephone, or by video conference before filing any motion.”])              Punitive Damages              A claim for punitive damages is subject to a motion to  strike when the allegations fail to rise to the level of malice, oppression, or  fraud necessary under Civil Code section 3294. (Turman v. Turning Point of  Central California, Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 64.) “An employer shall  not be liable for damages pursuant to subdivision (a), based upon acts of an  employee of the employer, unless the employer had advance knowledge of the  unfitness of the employee and employed him or her with a conscious disregard of  the rights or safety of others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct  for which the damages are awarded or was personally guilty of oppression,  fraud, or malice. With respect to a corporate employer, the advance knowledge  and conscious disregard, authorization, ratification or act of oppression,  fraud, or malice must be on the part of an officer, director, or managing agent  of the corporation.” (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (b).)              Big 5 moves to strike the punitive damages requests from  the complaint, contending that the complaint is devoid of any allegations  demonstrating malice, oppression, or fraud by Big 5. Big 5 contends the  allegations of the complaint are conclusory and lack the specificity required  to support a finding of malice, oppression, or fraud on the part of Big 5. Big  5 also contends Plaintiff has failed to allege any facts demonstrating intent,  despicable conduct, conscious disregard, or Plaintiff being subject to cruel  and unjust hardship. Big 5 further contends Plaintiff’s allegations directly  undermine any claim for punitive damages against Big 5, as the complaint  alleges Big 5 assisted Plaintiff by escorting him to his car due to Perez’s  threats.  Big 5 also contends that Plaintiff has failed to  satisfy the requirements for alleging punitive damages against a corporate  defendant by not alleging specific facts of wrongful conduct engaged in by  principals of Big 5. Big 5 contends Plaintiff has not established that Perez  had any authority over Big 5’s corporate policy or that any officers,  directors, or managing agents of Big 5 knew, directed, or otherwise ratified  Perez’s alleged conduct.              In opposition, Plaintiff contends the requests for  punitive damages are based on the allegations and factual circumstances  detailed throughout the complaint and are thus appropriately included. Plaintiff  contends the allegations of the complaint show that Big 5 knew or should have  known of Perez’s problematic behavior and failure to take appropriate action,  Big 5 failed to properly defuse the situation, and the aggressive behavior of  Perez, coupled with Big 5’s inadequate response, indicates an oppressive disregard  for Plaintiff’s rights.              The Court finds the complaint fails to allege sufficient  facts to support Plaintiff’s claims for punitive damages against Big 5.  Although the Court overruled the demurrer to the First through Third Causes of  Action, which otherwise would support requests for punitive damages, the  complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to satisfy the requirement of Civil  Code section 3294, subdivision (b), which applies to corporations like Big 5.  As noted above regarding Plaintiff’s negligent hiring, supervision, and  retention claim, the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts demonstrating  that Big 5 had advance knowledge of Perez’s violent propensities and  problematic behavior. The complaint only alleges in a conclusory fashion that  Big 5 had acknowledged “the problematic nature of [Perez], who had been causing  issues for customers.” (Compl., ¶ 7.) The complaint does not allege any facts  demonstrating what those issues were. The only incident at issue demonstrating  Perez’s allegedly problematic behavior is this one incident. (Compl., ¶ 10.)  The complaint does not allege any facts demonstrating that Big 5 had advance  knowledge of Perez’s problematic behavior at the time of the incident in  question. (See Compl., ¶¶ 5-17.) The complaint also contains no allegations of  an officer, director, or managing agent of Big 5 having advance knowledge and  conscious disregard, authorization, ratification or act of oppression, fraud,  or malice regarding Perez’s problematic behavior. (See Civ. Code, § 3294, subd.  (b).)              Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the  motion to strike as to page 7, lines 18-19, Prayer, paragraph 1c, page 7, lines  24-25, Prayer, paragraph 2c, page 8, lines 203, Prayer, paragraph 3c, and page  8, line 15, Prayer, paragraph 5d.              Attorney Fees              Attorney fees are recoverable when  authorized by statute, contract, or law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.  (a)(10); see City of Industry v. Gordon (1972) 29 Cal.App.3d 90, 93.)  Improper requests for attorney fees are subject to a motion to strike. (Code  Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (a) [strike out any improper matter asserted in any  pleading].)              Big 5 contends the prayer for  attorney’s fees is improper because there is no statutory or contractual basis  for recovery of attorney fees alleged in the complaint. Plaintiff’s opposition  does not address this argument.              The Court agrees  with Big 5. The complaint contains no allegations of a contract or statute or  other law that would authorize Plaintiff to recover attorney fees here. The  Court also construes Plaintiff’s lack of opposition to this argument as a tacit  admission that Big 5’s argument is meritorious. (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997)  58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410; C. Opposing the Motion—and Rebutting the Opposition,  Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 9(I)-C, ¶ 9:105.10; see also Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v. Colombo (2003) 111  Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215 [“Contentions are waived when a party fails to support  them with reasoned argument and citations to authority. [Citation.]”]  Based on the  foregoing, the Court GRANTS the motion to strike as to page 8, line 16, Prayer,  paragraph 5e.[2]              Irrelevant, False, or Improper  Matters              A motion to strike may be used to  strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matters. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436,  subd. (a).)              Big 5 seeks to strike various  paragraphs in the complaint on the grounds that they contain irrelevant, false,  or improper matters. Big 5 contends Plaintiff lumps Big 5 in with conduct  alleged to have been taken by Perez and that Plaintiff fails to allege facts by  Big 5’s managing agents.              In opposition, Plaintiff contends  that Big 5 seeks to strike allegations integral to the complaint that are  well-supported by the factual allegations. Plaintiff contends these allegations  are premised on the assertions that Perez, as an employee of Big 5,  intentionally harmed Plaintiff, and that Big 5 knew or should have known of  Perez’s problematic behavior.              The Court finds Big 5 fails to  demonstrate how these allegations, namely paragraphs 7, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24,  26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 35, 36, 40, 41, 43, 48, and 50, are irrelevant, false,  or improper. As discussed above, respondeat superior is a key issue with  respect to the First through Third Causes of Action, so even if Plaintiff  lumped the actions of Big 5 and Perez together, that does not necessarily  render these allegations irrelevant, false, or improper. Moreover, the  paragraphs Big 5 seeks to strike pertain specifically to the First through  Third Causes of Action. As noted above, the Court overruled the demurrer to the  First through Third Causes of Action because it found Plaintiff had alleged  sufficient facts to state those claims against Big 5. The Court otherwise finds  these paragraphs are supported by the underlying factual allegations. (See  Compl., ¶¶ 5-17.)              The Court DENIES the motion to  strike as to paragraphs 7, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 35,  36, 40, 41, 43, 48, and 50 of the complaint.  CONCLUSION  The Court OVERRULES the demurrer to the First, Second, and Third  Causes of Action. The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the Fourth and Fifth  Causes of Action with 20 days’ leave to amend.  The Court GRANTS the motion to strike as to the following portions  of the complaint:      1.      Page 7, lines  18-19, Prayer, paragraph 1c; 2.      Page 7, lines  24-25, Prayer, paragraph 2c; 3.      Page 8, lines  203, Prayer, paragraph 3c; 4.      Page 8, line  15, Prayer, paragraph 5d; and 5.  Page 8, line  16, Prayer, paragraph 5e.  The Court DENIES the motion to strike as to paragraphs 7, 17, 19,  20, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 35, 36, 40, 41, 43, 48, and 50 of the  complaint.               Big 5 is ordered to give notice of  the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
