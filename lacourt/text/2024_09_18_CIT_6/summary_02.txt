And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff seeks default judgment against the defendant in the amount of $391,597.71, including past-due rent, holdover damages, costs, and other damages. However, the court finds that the plaintiff's default judgment package has several issues. Firstly, the plaintiff's holdover damages calculation is excessive and should begin from the day after the notice to quit period ends. Secondly, the plaintiff's "other" damage calculation includes future rent and broker commissions, which are improper in an unlawful detainer action. The court also notes that it is unclear if the plaintiff can recover the free rent as past-due rent. Finally, the court points out that a default judgment for monetary damages can only be sought against the defendant, while a default judgment for possession only may include all tenants, subtenants, and occupants. The plaintiff is allowed to refile its request for default judgment once the issues have been addressed.
