And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's individual PAGA claims and stay the representative PAGA claim pending completion of arbitration. The plaintiff, Matthew Murray, had filed a lawsuit against the defendants, Ninth Avenue Foods, LLC and Heritage Distributing Company, alleging violations of labor laws, including failure to pay minimum and overtime wages, and failure to provide meal periods and rest breaks.

The defendants had argued that the arbitration agreement between the parties is valid and covers the plaintiff's claims, and that the plaintiff is not exempt from the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) as a transportation worker. The judge agreed with the defendants, finding that the arbitration agreement is valid and covers the plaintiff's claims, and that the plaintiff is not exempt from the FAA.

The judge also found that the representative PAGA claim cannot be split into an arbitrable individual claim and a non-arbitrable representative claim, and therefore granted the motion to stay the representative PAGA claim pending completion of arbitration.

The judge ordered the defendants to give notice of the ruling within five calendar days of the order.
