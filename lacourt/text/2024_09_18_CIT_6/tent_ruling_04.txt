   [1] Big 5 then  proceeds to argue about many purported facts not alleged in the complaint,  which the Court cannot consider on a demurrer. (Blank  v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.,  supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) These factual contentions are also  unavailing because whether someone was acting within the scope of employment  for purposes of respondeat superior is generally a question of fact not  amenable to demurrer. (See Perez v. Van Groningen &  Sons, Inc., supra, 41 Cal.3d at   p. 968; Panterra GP, Inc. v. Superior Court of Kern County, supra, 74  Cal.App.5th at p. 709.)   [2] The Court  notes that the moving papers identified the request for attorney fees as part  of paragraph 5d of the Prayer for Relief, but the complaint shows this request  is in fact paragraph 5e of the Prayer for Relief. (Compl., p. 8, ln. 16, ¶ 5,  subd. (e).)
