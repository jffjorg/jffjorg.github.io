```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the demurrer filed by Big 5 and the related request for attorney fees. The court notes that Big 5 has presented many purported facts not alleged in the complaint, which cannot be considered on a demurrer. Additionally, whether someone was acting within the scope of employment for purposes of respondeat superior is generally a question of fact not amenable to demurrer. The court also points out an error in the identification of the request for attorney fees, which is actually located in paragraph 5e of the Prayer for Relief, not paragraph 5d as claimed.
