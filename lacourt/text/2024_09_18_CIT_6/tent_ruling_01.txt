  Case Number:  23WCUD01976    Hearing Date:   September 18, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE  NAME:  Donlin  Properties A General Partnership v. Precision Machine Work, Inc., a California  Corporation  Plaintiff’s  Motion to Enforce Unlawful Detainer Stipulation and Judgment  TENTATIVE  RULING  The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to enforce unlawful detainer  stipulation and judgment. The Court will sign the proposed judgment.              Plaintiff is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.  BACKGROUND  This is a commercial unlawful detainer case. On September 15, 2023,  plaintiff Donlin Properties A General Partnership (Plaintiff) filed this action  against defendant Precision Machine Work, Inc., a California Corporation (Defendant)  and Does 1 through 3, alleging the sole cause of action for unlawful detainer.  On May 1, 2024, Plaintiff moved to enforce the unlawful detainer  stipulation and judgment. On September 5, 2024, Defendant opposed the motion.  On September 11, 2024, Plaintiff replied.  LEGAL  STANDARD  “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a  writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally  before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon  motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If  requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to  enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the  settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a).)  “We note that even if the terms of the judgment could  be extended, a court's power to make factual determinations under section 664.6  is generally limited to whether the parties entered into a valid and binding  settlement agreement. [Citation.] The power would not appear to extend, at  least under the facts of this case, to whether one party had breached the terms  of the agreement. Judgment may be entered under section 664.6 whether the  parties are complying with the terms of the agreement or whether they are not.”  (Viejo Bancorp, Inc. v. Wood (1989) 217 Cal.App.3d 200,  209.)  REQUESTS FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE              The Court GRANTS  Plaintiff’s requests for judicial notice submitted with its moving papers. (Evid. Code §  452, subd. (d).) However, the Court takes judicial  notice only as to “the existence, content and authenticity of public records  and other specified documents”; it does not take judicial notice of the truth  of the factual matters asserted in those documents. (Dominguez  v. Bonta (2022) 87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.)  DISCUSSION              Plaintiff seeks to enforce the  stipulation and judgment the parties entered into on December 13, 2023 (the  Settlement). Plaintiff contends the Settlement provides that Defendant  acknowledges owing Plaintiff $111,048.01 in past due rent, but that Plaintiff  would accept $64,000.00 instead if Defendant made 16 monthly payments of $4,000.00  and vacated the subject property. Plaintiff then contends the Settlement  provides Defendant would owe the full amount if Defendant failed to make any  payments due, less any prior payments actually received. Plaintiff contends  that although Defendant did vacate the subject property, Defendant did not make  any payments as promised, and therefore owes Plaintiff the full amount of  $111,048.01 in past due rent. Plaintiff further notes that the Settlement  provides Defendant waived any right to challenge or appeal the stipulated  judgment and that the case file would be unsealed if Defendant breached the  terms of the Settlement.  In opposition, Defendant contends the Court lacks jurisdiction to  enter a judgment that exceeds the monetary limitation within the complaint, and  notes that the Court previously granted Defendant’s motion to set aside the  judgment for this reason. Defendant contends this is a limited civil case,  which limits the Court’s jurisdiction to $10,000.00, so the Court cannot enter  a judgment greater than $10,000.00. Defendant also contends Plaintiff has not  submitted any motion to reclassify this case from limited to unlimited, and  that such time has now passed.              The Court finds that the parties have entered into a  valid and binding settlement agreement. Plaintiff provided a copy of the December  13, 2023 stipulation and judgment with its moving papers, which provides for  the Court’s retention of jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure section  664.6, subdivision (a), among other things. (Request for Judicial Notice  (8/20/24), Ex. A (the Stipulation).) Both parties executed the Stipulation. (Id.)  Defendant acknowledged the full $111,048.01 in past due rent owed to Plaintiff.  (Id.) The Stipulation provides that Plaintiff is entitled to recover the  full $111,048.01 in past due rent if Defendant failed to pay the $64,000.00 per  the schedule set forth therein. (Id.; see also Red & White Distribution, LLC v. Osteroid Enterprises, LLC  (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 582, 589 [“’it is permissible under [Civil Code] section  1671 for the parties to agree to a discount for timely payment of an admitted  debt.’ [Citation.]”)              Moreover, although the Court set aside the money portion  of the judgment on August 13, 2024, it also ordered that all other orders and  findings made by the Court on December 13, 2023 remain fully effective. (Minute  Order (8/13/24).) It did so because the money judgment was prematurely entered  simultaneously with the judgment for possession, and because this action at  that time was classified as limited civil, which created a jurisdictional limit  of $10,000.00. (See Stratton v. Beck (2017) 9  Cal.App.5th 483, 492.) However, the prior Court reclassified the case from  limited civil to unlimited civil, thus remedying the prior jurisdictional defect.  (See Notice of Reclassification (7/29/24).) Code of Civil Procedure section  403.040, subdivision (a) provides that “[t]he court, on its own motion, may  reclassify a case at any time.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040(a).) Accordingly, whether  the deadline for Plaintiff to move for reclassification has passed is  irrelevant, (see Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (a)), and Plaintiff was free  to again seek entry of judgment per the terms of the Settlement, (see Id.,  § 664.6, subd. (a)). The Court therefore now has jurisdiction to enter the  money judgment per the terms of the Stipulation. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6,  subd. (a); see also Viejo Bancorp, Inc., supra, 217 Cal.App.3d at p. 209  fn. 4 [judgment may be entered regardless of compliance with the terms of the  settlement agreement]; Stratton v. Beck, supra, 9  Cal.App.5th at p. 492 [limited civil case may be reclassified to unlimited  civil to address jurisdictional issues].)              The Court finds that Defendant failed to make any of the  payments agreed to in the Stipulation. (Wright Decl., ¶ 3.) The Court notes  that Defendant’s Opposition does not dispute Plaintiff’s contention regarding  his breach of the Stipulation.  Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the motion for entry of  judgment in the amount of $111,048.01.  CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to enforce unlawful detainer  stipulation and judgment. The Court will sign the proposed judgment.              Plaintiff is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
