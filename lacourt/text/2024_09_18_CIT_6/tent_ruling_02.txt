 Case Number:  24PSCV01393    Hearing Date:   September 18, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff  Benik, LLC’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment  Defendants:  Bespoke Group,  Inc., and all other tenants, subtenants, and occupants in possession  COURT RULING            Plaintiff’s request for entry of  default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.            BACKGROUND                        This  is a commercial unlawful detainer action. On May 1, 2024, plaintiff Benik, LLC  (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant Bespoke Group, Inc. (Defendant)  and Does 1 to 20, alleging the sole cause of action for unlawful detainer. On  May 21, 2024, default was entered against Defendant and all other tenants,  subtenants, and occupants in possession. On June 27, 2024, Plaintiff requested  entry of default judgment.            LEGAL  STANDARD  Code of  Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party  has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party  seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court  Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other  admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest  computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration  of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all  parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate  judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of  grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for  attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.  Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.)  ANALYSIS  Plaintiff  seeks default judgment against Defendant in the total amount of $391,597.71,  including $67,169.72 in past-due rent, $97,314.56 in holdover damages, $1,115.84  in costs, and $225,997.59 in other damages. The Court finds Plaintiff’s default  judgment package has some issues.  First, Plaintiff’s  holdover damages calculation is excessive. Holdover damages start from the day  after the notice to quit period ends. (CACI 4340.) The Complaint alleges the  notice period expired April 24, 2024. (Compl., ¶ 9.b.(1).) Thus, the  calculations should begin April 25, 2024, not April 19, 2024. (UD-116, ¶ 12,  subd. (c); Summary of Case, p. 2:13-14.)  Second,  Plaintiff’s “other” damage calculation includes future rent and broker  commissions, which are improper here. (UD-116, ¶ 24, subd. (b); Summary of  Case, pp. 4-5.) “It is well settled that  damages allowed in unlawful detainer proceedings are only those which result from the unlawful detention and accrue during  that time. [Citation.]” (Vasey v. California Dance Co.  (1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 742, 748, italics in original.) “[T]he award of damages  for breaches of the lease occurring before the unlawful detainer [citation] and  of ‘future damages’ for continued unlawful possession beyond the date of the  judgment until such time as possession is returned to the landlord are not  permitted in unlawful detainer.” (Hudec v. Robertson  (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1156, 1163.) It is unclear if Plaintiff can even recover  the $39,800 in free rent as past-due rent here since that arguably was not  considered unpaid until a breach occurred. (See Compl., Ex. 1, ¶ 52; UD-116, ¶  24, subd. (a); Summary of Case, p. 3.) If Plaintiff seeks to recover unpaid  rent for the remainder of the lease term or other remedies provided under the  contract, such as the broker commissions or free rent, Plaintiff may pursue  such matters in a separate civil action. (Vasey v. California Dance Co.,  supra, 70 Cal.App.3d at p. 748 fn. 2.)        Finally, a default judgment for monetary  damages can only be sought against the defendant. A default judgment for  possession only may include all tenants, subtenants and occupants. (Civ. Proc.  Code §§ 715.010, 1169.)  CONCLUSION               Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s  request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
