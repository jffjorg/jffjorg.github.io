And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff sought default judgment against the defendant in the total amount of $391,597.71, including past-due rent, holdover damages, costs, and other damages. However, the judge found issues with the plaintiff's default judgment package. Specifically, the holdover damages calculation was excessive, and the "other" damage calculation included future rent and broker commissions, which are improper in an unlawful detainer proceeding. Additionally, it is unclear if the plaintiff can recover the $39,800 in free rent as past-due rent. The judge concludes that the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment is denied without prejudice, and the plaintiff may pursue separate civil action for unpaid rent and other remedies.
