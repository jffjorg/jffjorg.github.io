And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

On May 8, 2024, Judge William A. Crowfoot issued a tentative ruling in the case of Raffi Pililian, et al. v. CVS Pharmacy, Inc., et al. The case arises from an incident on September 15, 2021, when Raffi Pililian received a COVID-19 vaccine booster injection and subsequently fainted and was injured.

The defendant, CVS Pharmacy, Inc., filed a demurrer to each cause of action in the complaint. The plaintiff, Raffi Pililian, et al., argue that the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act) does not apply to their claims. They argue that the PREP Act only applies to claims related to the administration of a covered countermeasure, and that their claims arise from a dangerous condition on the defendant's premises, not the administration of the vaccine.

The judge ruled that the PREP Act does apply to the case and bars the plaintiffs' claims. The judge held that the plaintiffs' injuries were caused by the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine booster shot, and that the PREP Act immunizes the defendant from liability in state court.

The judge also ruled that the defendant's demurrer is sustained without leave to amend. The case is set for a hearing on May 8, 2024.
