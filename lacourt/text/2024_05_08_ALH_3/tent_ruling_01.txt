On December 30, 2021, plaintiff Jung H.
Son (“Plaintiff”) filed this action for breach of contract against defendants
Young S. Choi (“Defendant”), Boston Asset Management, LLC, Specman Corporation,
and Boston Pomello Property, LLC. On May 17, 2022, Plaintiff filed a First
Amended Complaint which added Hea Holdings Co., Ltd. as a plaintiff. 
On May 27, 2022, a request for
dismissal was filed and the clerk dismissed the action with prejudice. 
On March 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed this
motion to set aside the dismissal with prejudice on the grounds that the
request for dismissal with prejudice was filed by his attorney, Chang Ryul Ji
(“Ji”), without authorization. 
On April 24, 2024, Defendant filed an
opposition brief. Defendant also asserted numerous evidentiary objections to
the declarations filed in support of Plaintiff’s motion. Upon review, these
objections are overruled.
On May 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply
brief and a supporting supplemental declaration. 
An unauthorized dismissal may be
vacated at any time regardless of the time limitations set forth in Code of
Civil Procedure section 473. (Whittier Union High School Dist. v. Sup. Ct.
(Carroll) (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 504, 509; Romadka v. Hoge (1991) 232
Cal.App.3d 1231.) Plaintiff declares that in May 2022, he only authorized Ji to
dismiss the action without prejudice. (Son Decl., ¶ 6.) On or about July 7,
2023, he communicated with Ji via Kako Talk to file a new lawsuit against the
defendants, but Ji said that he was on vacation until July 15, 2023. (Son
Decl., ¶¶ 7-8.) On July 18, 2023, Plaintiff met with Frederick W. Lee, who is
currently Plaintiff’s counsel of record, and Mr. Lee provided Plaintiff with a
copy of the request for dismissal. (Id.) Thereafter, Plaintiff and Mr.
Lee sought to move forward with a motion to set aside the dismissal and
attempted to obtain a declaration from Ji. (Son Decl., ¶ 12.) Ji refused to
provide a declaration unless Plaintiff agreed to release any claims for
malpractice. (Son Decl., ¶ 13.) From November 2023 to February 2024, another
attorney representing Plaintiff, Sam M. Muriella (“Muriella”) communicated with
Ji’s attorney to obtain a declaration from Ji to support this motion. (Muriella
Decl., ¶¶ 5-9.) 
In opposition, Defendant argues that the
motion should be denied as untimely because Plaintiff knew, as early as June 7,
2022, that the action was dismissed with prejudice. Defense counsel declares
that he sent a copy of the dismissal to Peter Lee on June 2, 2022, who was
purportedly acting on Plaintiff’s behalf. (Myung Decl., Ex. 1.) However, on
reply, Plaintiff submits a supplemental declaration in which he states that he
met with Peter Lee only on May 25, 2022, and did not have any further
communications with him, nor did he retain Peter Lee as his attorney. (Son
Decl., ¶¶ 4-8.) Therefore, the fact that defense counsel gave Peter Lee a copy
of the dismissal is irrelevant. 
In light of the foregoing, the motion
to set aside the dismissal with prejudice is GRANTED and the dismissal is
amended to state that it is without prejudice.
