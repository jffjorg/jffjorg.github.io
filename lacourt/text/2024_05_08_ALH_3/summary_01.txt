And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the action with prejudice. The plaintiff claimed that he did not authorize the dismissal, which was filed by his attorney without his knowledge. The defendant opposed the motion, arguing that the plaintiff knew about the dismissal in June 2022 and that the motion was untimely. The judge has ruled in favor of the plaintiff, granting the motion and amending the dismissal to state that it is without prejudice.
