Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ruled that a demurrer to the complaint filed by Plaintiff Roger A. Velasco and Marisa Cisneros against Defendant Leslie Gudiel should be sustained. The demurrer was filed on behalf of Defendant Gudiel, who claims that the complaint was improperly filled out and lacks sufficient facts to sustain a cause of action for breach of contract. The court agrees with Defendant's contention that the complaint was improperly filled out and that it lacks sufficient facts to state a cause of action. As a result, the court sustains the demurrer and grants Plaintiffs 20 days leave to amend the complaint.
