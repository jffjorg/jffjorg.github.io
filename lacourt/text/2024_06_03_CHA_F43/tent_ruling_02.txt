I.           
BACKGROUND
            On November 17, 2023 Roger Velasco
and Marisa Cisneros (Plaintiffs) filed a Complaint against Leslie Gudiel
(Defendant). The Complaint appears to be grounded in a breach of contract claim
and alleges $60,000.00 in damages and $15,000.00 in attorney’s fees. (See
generally, the Complaint.) The motion before the Court now is Defendant’s
Demurrer to the Complaint. No opposition has been filed. 
 
    
II.           
DISCUSSION
 
Meet
and Confer
            “Before filing a demurrer…the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party
who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc. §430.41(a).)
Defendant provides the Declaration of Luis Duenas (Duenas Decl.) which states
that the parties spoke on January 26, 2024 but could not reach an agreement.
Nonetheless, the requirements of Code Civ. Proc. §430.41(a) have been
satisfied. The Court now turns to the demurrer. 
 
Legal
Standard
            “[A] demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.) A demurrer
can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading
under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (See Donabedian v. Mercury
Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a demurrer, a court
may not consider declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or
documents not accepted for the truth of their contents].) For purposes of
ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true,
but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hosp. Dist. (1992) 2
Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Analysis
            Defendant contends the demurrer
should be sustained because (1) the form Complaint was improperly filled out
and (2) the Complaint lacks sufficient facts to sustain a cause of action for
breach of contract. The Court agrees, sustains the demurrer, and grants
Plaintiffs 20 days leave to amend. 
 
            As outlined in the demurrer,
Plaintiffs failed to properly complete the Complaint form. For example, in paragraph
4(a)(5) on page 1, the box adjacent to the word, "other (specify)" is
checked, but there is nothing inserted to the right of that designation.
Another example is paragraph 4(b)(1) on page 2, Plaintiffs check the box
adjacent to the box "Doe Defendants", but neither the caption of the
Complaint, nor the remainder of that paragraph identifies any Doe Defendants.
Finally, in paragraph 8 on page 2, Plaintiffs allege what appears to be a cause
of action for breach of contract and claim that it concerns an “illegal
apartment unit”, however no details are provided.
 
            The lack of detail bolsters
Defendant’s second point which is the Complaint fails to allege facts
sufficient to state a cause of action. To state a cause of action for breach of
contract, Plaintiff must be able to establish “(1) the existence of the
contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011)
51 Cal.4th 811, 821.) If a breach of contract claim “is based on alleged breach
of a written contract, the terms must be set out verbatim in the body of the
complaint or a copy of the written agreement must be attached and incorporated
by reference.” (Harris v. Rudin, Richman
& Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 307.) In some circumstances, a
plaintiff may also “plead the legal effect of the contract rather than its
precise language.” (Construction
Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189,
198-199.)
 
            There is no detail in the Complaint
as to whether the contract was written, oral, or implied. The contract is not
attached, repeated verbatim, nor are the legal effects of the contract plead.
Therefore, the demurrer is sustained.
 
Leave
to Amend
            Leave to amend must be allowed where
there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (See Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349 [court shall not “sustain a demurrer without
leave to amend if there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be
cured by amendment”]. As there is reasonable possibility of successful
amendment, the Court shall grant leave to amend.
 
 
III.           
CONCLUSION 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Demurrer to Plaintiffs’ Complaint is SUSTAINED.
Plaintiffs are granted 20 days leave to amend.
