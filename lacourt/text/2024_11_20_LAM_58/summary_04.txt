And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion of Defendant Yapstone Holdings, Inc.'s counsel, Michael B. Garfinkel and Caitlin Blanche of Venable LLP, to be relieved as counsel. The counsel has complied with the rules of court by filing the necessary forms and submitting a supporting declaration explaining why they are seeking to withdraw. The judge notes that the counsel asserts that Defendant Yapstone has made it unreasonably difficult for them to carry out the representation effectively and has failed to adhere to the material terms of its retainer agreement. The judge also notes that the trial is set for December 3, 2024, and that granting this motion would almost certainly leave Defendant without an attorney for trial. However, since Defendant has not opposed the motion, the judge grants the motion despite the potential prejudice to Defendant. The judge sets an order to show cause for December 2, 2024, to show cause why Defendant's answer should not be stricken and a default entered against Defendant if new counsel is not appointed by that date.
