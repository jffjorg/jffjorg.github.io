And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for attorney fees in the reduced amount of $60,625, and the request for costs in the reduced amount of $2,381.15. The judge has also ordered the defendant to pay the sum of $63,006.15 to the plaintiff's counsel on or before December 23, 2024.

The judge has reviewed the evidence and determined that the attorney fees were reasonably incurred in enforcing the judgment. The judge has also considered the hourly rate of the attorney, which is reasonable given the complexity of the litigation and the attorney's experience.

The judge has reduced the amount of hours incurred for certain tasks, including applying for an order for sale and settlement discussions, as they were excessive given the attorney's experience and the complexity of the tasks. The judge has also stricken certain costs, including the LA County Sheriff's Department levy fee, as the plaintiff has not met its burden to prove the costs.

Overall, the judge has granted the motion for attorney fees and costs, but has reduced the amount of fees and costs awarded to the plaintiff.
