And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the arbitration agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). The plaintiff's role was changed from a salaried executive to an hourly analyst, and the court does not need to rule on the defendant's alternative relief seeking to be dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction. The defendant's request for arbitration is denied because it is not proper to seek both a substantive adjudicatory ruling on the merits within the judicial litigation process and also the arbitral forum. The court finds that the defendant's conduct in seeking both options constitutes a waiver of the right to compel arbitration. Therefore, the court declines to rule on the defendant's demurrer and instead sends the dispute to arbitration.
