And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motion to quash service of process brought by Defendant M&Y Personal Injury Lawyers and has denied the motion. The Court finds that the service of summons and complaint was proper, despite Defendant's objections. The Court notes that the proof of service shows that service was attempted at Defendant's office building on June 24, 2024, and that the security guard who was served with the complaint was authorized to receive service on behalf of the corporation. The Court further finds that the process server made a good faith effort to personally serve the defendant before resorting to substitute service, and that the service was not defective. Finally, the Court notes that Defendant's objections to the proof of service are based on inadmissible hearsay and lack personal knowledge.
