[1] Defendant contends that this Arbitration Agreement is
governed by the FAA. Plaintiff does not dispute that the FAA applies.
 


[2] Plaintiff’s role was changed from a salaried Senior Sales
Executive to an hourly Lot Receiving Data Analyst.


[3] As result of the Court’s ruling on
this issue, the Court need not rule on the alternative relief sought by
Defendant Green, seeking to be dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction. 
 


[4] To be sure, Defendant Platinum seeks
arbitration only as an alternative to the demurrer if the Court does not
sustain all of Plaintiff’s claims on demurrer. However, seeking both the
benefit of a substantive adjudicatory ruling on the merits within the judicial
litigation process and also the arbitral forum is not proper. (Groom v.
Health Net (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1189, 1195 [“[T]he superior court's
opinion as to the legal validity of those theories will not be binding on the
arbitrator.”]; Titan/Value Equities Group, Inc. v. Superior Court (1994)
29 Cal.App.4th 482, 486–489 [trial court may not determine the status of claims
to be resolved by arbitrator]; East San Bernardino County Water Dist. v.
City of San Bernardino (1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 942, 954–955 [it is for the
arbitrator to determine what issues are raised by the dispute; the court's
opinion is not binding on the arbitrator]; Northcutt Lumber Co. v. Goldeen's
Peninsula, Inc. (1973) 30 Cal.App.3d 440, 445, [where trial court
erroneously proceeded to trial instead of ordering arbitration, arbitrator on
reversal of the judgment should disregard trial court's opinion on the
merits].) Moreover, courts have in some cases found this conduct constituted a
waiver of the right to compel arbitration. (See Lewis v.
Fletcher Jones Motor Cars, Inc. (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 436, 446 [waiver
when defendant “litigated the merits of ... claims through two demurrers and a
motion to strike and participated in discovery without raising its right to
arbitration” for four months]; Adolph v. Coastal Auto Sales, Inc. (2010)
184 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, 1451–1452 [waiver after demurrers for failure to
state claim].)  Thus, because arbitration
is the appropriate forum for all Defendants, the Court declines to rule on Platinum’s
demurrer. Challenges to the pleadings may be presented to the arbitrator.
