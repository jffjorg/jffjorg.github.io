The judge has made a tentative ruling on the motion to compel arbitration. The motion was filed by Unical Aviation, Inc. and Sharon Green, who argue that the arbitration agreement signed by the parties in 2016 applies to all claims up to 2023. The plaintiff, Raymond Ngo, argues that the arbitration agreement does not apply to claims arising after the 2020 furlough.

The judge has ruled that the arbitration agreement does apply to all claims up to 2023. The judge has also ruled that Sharon Green, as the CEO of Unical, is an intended third-party beneficiary to the arbitration agreement. The judge has granted the motion to compel arbitration as to Unical, Sharon Green, and Platinum Equity Advisors, LLC. The matter is stayed pending arbitration.
