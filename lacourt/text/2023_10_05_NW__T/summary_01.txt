And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' special motion to strike the First Amended Complaint (FAC) and sustains the demurrer to the FAC without leave to amend. The defendants, Mountain Recovery, LLC, Adam Harari, and Jonathan Harari, moved to strike the FAC's claims for negligence per se, intentional infliction of emotional distress, fraud, and violation of the Unfair Competition Law (UCL), alleging that the claims arise from their right to petition. The plaintiff, Alexander Everest, did not file an opposition to the motion. The Court finds that the claims arise from protected activity and that the plaintiff failed to meet his burden to show a probability of prevailing with admissible evidence. The demurrer to the FAC is sustained because the plaintiff's claims fail to allege sufficient facts and/or are uncertain, and the plaintiff did not file a request to amend.
