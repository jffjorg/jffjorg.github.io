 Case Number:  22VECP00563    Hearing Date:   October 5, 2023    Dept:  T 22VECP00563 In re Shicole Lanae Brown
[TENTATIVE] ORDER: 
Petitioner Shicole Lanae Brown’s Motion to Redact Court Records is
DENIED.
Introduction
Petitioner Shicole Lanae Brown (Petitioner) moved to redact
the court records previously filed between October 11, 2022 and December 8,
2022, and/or prior to the filing of the instant motion.
Discussion 
Petitioner did not present legal authority to support the
requested relief.  The Court interprets
the motion to be a motion to seal court records under California Rules of
Court, rule 2.550.  Unfortunately, filing
documents before obtaining an order for sealing waives confidentiality.  (Savaglio v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (2007) 149
Cal.App.4th 588, 601.)  Because the
Petitioner is seeking the sealing of the Court file or its records after the
documents were filed by her, there is insufficient legal authority to grant the
requested relief.
The motion to redact the court records is DENIED. 
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
