And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the moving papers, response, and reply papers in this case. On May 13, 2022, the plaintiff, Anthony Young, filed an action against several defendants, including Rasier, LLC, Rasier-CA, LLC, Efrain Carrasco Sanchez, and others. The defendants, including Uber Technologies, Inc., Rasier, LLC, and Rasier-CA, LLC, filed answers to the complaint.

On October 12, 2023, Carrasco Sanchez filed a motion to compel the plaintiff to appear for a deposition. The plaintiff stated that he is willing to appear for a deposition, but has faced obstacles, including lack of funds and lack of a mobile phone. Despite the plaintiff's stated willingness to appear, the court finds that the plaintiff will not attend his deposition without a court order.

The court grants the motion and orders the plaintiff to attend his deposition within 30 days of the hearing on this motion. The defendant, Carrasco Sanchez, is to make all necessary arrangements to take the plaintiff's deposition by this deadline.
