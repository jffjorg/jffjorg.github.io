LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order
compelling a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including
the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent exceptional
circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or any attorney
of a party for failure to provide electronically stored information that has
been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of the routine, good
faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides: 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) 
          C.      Requests
for admission 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides: 
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The requesting party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
DISCUSSION  
On
May 1, 2023, LACMTA served requests for production of documents, set one, special
interrogatories, set one, form interrogatories, set one, and requests for
admission, set one, on Plaintiff. The parties agreed to continue the deadline
for Plaintiff’s responses to July 28, 2023. Plaintiff had not provided any
responses by the time LACMTA filed its motions on August 17, 2023. 
On
September 18, 2023 – prior to the September 25, 2023 hearing date -- Plaintiff
served responses to the discovery requests. Although Plaintiff had waived any
objections by not serving timely responses, LACMTA asserts that (1) Plaintiff’s
responses to the requests for production of documents contained only objections,
(2) Plaintiff’s responses to the special interrogatories included a preliminary
statement of objections, and (3) Plaintiff’s responses to the requests for
admission were not code-compliant. 
(LACMTA did not file a reply addressing the motion to compel responses
to the form interrogatories.)  Neither party
has provided copies of Plaintiff’s late-served discovery responses to the
Court. 
The Court denies LACMTA’s motion to compel responses
to the requests for production of documents. 
LACMTA may file a motion to compel further responses if, as it asserts, Plaintiff’s
responses contained objections despite Plaintiff’s waiver of objections. 
The Court denies LACMTA’s motion to compel responses
to the special interrogatories.  LACMTA
may file a motion to compel further responses if, as it asserts, Plaintiff’s
responses contained a preliminary statement of objections despite Plaintiff’s
waiver of objections. 
The
Court denies LACMTA’s motion to compel responses to the form interrogatories. 
The
Court denies LACMTA’s motion to deem admitted matters specified in the requests
for admission.  LACMTA asserts that the
late-served responses were not code-compliant but has not provided copies of
the responses or a declaration that might serve as evidence of the defects. 
The
Court grants LACMTA’s request for sanctions based on Plaintiff’s late responses
to the requests for admission.  (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  LACMTA
requests $525 based on 1.5 hours of attorney time at a rate of $350 per hour.  The Court grants $375 in sanctions based on
1.5 hours of attorney time at a reasonable rate of $250 per hour. 
The
Court denies LACMTA’s requests for sanctions based on the motions to compel
responses to the requests for production of documents, special interrogatories,
and form interrogatories.  Sanctions for
these motions are available only when a party unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel.

The Court DENIES Defendant Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s motion to compel Plaintiff Melissa
Molina Ruiz’s responses to requests for production of documents, set one. 
The Court DENIES Defendant Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s motion to compel Plaintiff Melissa
