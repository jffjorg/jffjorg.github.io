And here is the English-text summary:

The Court's tentative ruling grants leave to file an amended answer to the complaint filed by Plaintiff Keily Almendares against Defendants Scott Calder Warren and Linda Calder. The amended answer seeks to add new affirmative defenses, including the sudden emergency doctrine, which Defendants contend is applicable to the accident in question. Plaintiff had opposed the motion, arguing that it was untimely and that there was no evidence to support the new affirmative defense. However, the Court found that even if the motion was untimely, it was not an abuse of discretion to grant leave to amend, as Plaintiff had sufficient time to conduct discovery on the new affirmative defense before trial. The Court also noted that it would not evaluate the truth or strength of the pleadings when deciding whether to grant leave to amend.
