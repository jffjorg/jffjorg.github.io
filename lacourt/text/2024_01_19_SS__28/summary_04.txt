And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the plaintiff's action against Laboratory Corporation of America with prejudice. The plaintiff, Michael Gjona, failed to comply with the court's order to provide verified code-compliant responses to the defendant's discovery requests and failed to pay the ordered monetary sanctions. As a result, the court found that a lesser sanction than dismissal would not result in the plaintiff complying with his discovery obligations. The court relied on California Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (d)(3), which authorizes the court to dismiss an action if a party fails to comply with a discovery order. The court cited several precedents, including Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian, Deyo v. Kilbourne, and Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem, to support its decision. The judgment is effective immediately, and the moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
