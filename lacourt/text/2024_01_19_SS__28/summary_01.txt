Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a Judge regarding a motion to quash a subpoena served by Costco Wholesale Corporation on the Law Offices of Howard Choi. The subpoena seeks various medical records and documents related to Plaintiff Cynthia Hopes' injuries, including those from a July 2021 car accident. The Judge denies the motion to the extent it seeks information about the car accident, but grants the motion in all other respects, quashing the subpoena. The Court finds that Costco is entitled to discover information about the July 2021 car accident, resulting injuries, and medical treatment for those injuries. The Judge balances the competing rights of the litigant (Costco) and the individual (Plaintiff) in determining what information is discoverable.
