 Case Number:  22STCV08813    Hearing Date:   January 19, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
March 11, 2022, Plaintiff Michael Gjona
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Laboratory
Corporation of America (“Defendant”), John Doe, and Does 1-25 for
negligence and premises liability. 
On
August 18, 2022, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
June 29, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be relieved as
counsel. 
On
November 6, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss for failure to comply with
Court order, to be heard on January 19, 2024. 
The
trial is currently set for July 25, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Defendant
requests that the Court dismiss the case. 
LEGAL STANDARD  
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 provides in part: 
          “To the extent authorized by the
chapter governing any particular discovery method or any other provision of
this title, the court, after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney,
and after opportunity for hearing, may impose the following sanctions against
anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process: 
                                                            *
* *
           “(d) The court may impose a
terminating sanction by one of the following orders: 
          “(1) An order striking out the
pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process. 
          “(2) An order staying further
proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is obeyed. 
          “(3) An order dismissing the action,
or any part of the action, of that party. 
          “(4) An order rendering a judgment by
default against that party.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,
subds. (a), (d).) 
          A violation of a discovery order supports the imposition of
terminating sanctions. (Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620.) Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party
persists in disobeying the court's orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84
Cal.App.3d 771, 795-796 (Deyo).) 
          A terminating sanction is a "drastic measure which
should be employed with caution." (Deyo, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) "A decision to order terminating sanctions should
not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of
abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce
compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing
the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.) 
DISCUSSION 
          On
October 2, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s unopposed motions to compel
Plaintiff’s responses to requests for production, form interrogatories, and
requests for admission and ordered Plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant
responses without objections and pay Defendant monetary sanctions by November
1, 2023. 
Plaintiff
has not complied with the Court’s October 2, 2023 order. The Court finds that,
in light of Plaintiff’s failure respond to Defendant's discovery requests and
failure to comply with the Court's October 2, 2023 order, no lesser sanction
than dismissal would result in Plaintiff complying with his discovery
obligations. The Court grants the motion. 
 CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Laboratory Corporation of America’s motion and DISMISSES Plaintiff
Michael Gjona's action against Defendant
Laboratory Corporation of America with prejudice under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.030, subdivision (d)(3). 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
