PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Carrasco

 Plaintiff

LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 provides in part: 
“(a) If, after service of a
deposition notice, a party to the action . . . , without having served a valid
objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to
proceed with it, or to produce for
inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing
described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an
order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production
for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice. 
“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
both of the following: 
“(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice. 
“(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to
attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance.  * * * “(g) (1) If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted,
the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the
deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. 
“(2) On motion of any other party who, in person or by
attorney, attended at the time and place specified in the deposition notice in
the expectation that the deponent’s testimony would be taken, the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
in favor of that party and against the deponent or the party with whom the
deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subds. (a), (b), (g).) 
DISCUSSION  
Carrasco
Sanchez first noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for April 28, 2023.  The parties agreed to take Plaintiff’s
deposition off calendar due to a change in Plaintiff’s counsel. 
Carrasco
Sanchez re-noticed the deposition for June 16, 2023, a date provided by
Plaintiff's counsel. On June 15, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel informed Carrasco Sanchez
that Plaintiff needed to continue the deposition. 
On
June 27, 2023, the parties agreed to schedule the deposition for July 3.
Plaintiff failed to appear for the deposition.  On July 12, 2023, the parties agreed to set
Plaintiff’s deposition on July 14, 2023. Plaintiff failed to appear. On July
18, 2023, the parties agreed to set Plaintiff’s deposition on July 20, 2023.
Again, Plaintiff failed to appear. 
Plaintiff also failed to appear at a scheduled September 27, 2023
deposition. 
Plaintiff
asserts that he is willing to appear for a deposition but has faced obstacles
including lack of funds and lack of a mobile phone. 
The
Court grants the motion. Despite Plaintiff’s stated willingness to appear for a
deposition, the facts suggest that Plaintiff will not attend his deposition
without a court order. 
CONCLUSION 
          The Court GRANTS
Defendant Efrain Carrasco Sanchez’s motion to compel
Plaintiff Anthony Young to attend his deposition within
30 days of the hearing on this motion. Defendant Efrain Carrasco Sanchez
is to make all necessary arrangements to take Plaintiff's deposition by this
deadline. 
          Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
