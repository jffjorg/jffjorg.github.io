PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court quash Costco’s subpoena for business records served on the
Law Offices of Howard Choi (“deponent”). 
Costco
requests that the Court deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 1987.1 provides: 
"(a) If a subpoena requires the attendance of a
witness or the production of books, documents, electronically stored
information, or other things before a court, or at the trial of an issue
therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the court, upon motion reasonably
made by any person described in subdivision (b), or upon the court’s own motion
after giving counsel notice and an opportunity to be heard, may make an order
quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it
upon those terms or conditions as the court shall declare, including protective
orders. In addition, the court may make any other order as may be appropriate
to protect the person from unreasonable or oppressive demands, including
unreasonable violations of the right of privacy of the person. 
"(b) The following persons may make a motion
pursuant to subdivision (a): (1) A party. (2) A witness. (3) A consumer
described in Section 1985.3. (4) An employee described in Section 1985.6. (5) A
person whose personally identifying information, as defined in subdivision (b)
of Section 1798.79.8 of the Civil Code, is sought in connection with an
underlying action involving that person’s exercise of free speech rights." 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1.) 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 1985.3, subdivision (g),
provides in part: 
“(g)  Any
consumer whose personal records are sought by a subpoena duces tecum and who is
a party to the civil action in which this subpoena duces tecum is served may,
prior to the date for production, bring a motion under Section 1987.1 to quash
or modify the subpoena duces tecum. Notice of the bringing of that motion shall
be given to the witness and deposition officer at least five days prior to
production. The failure to provide notice to the deposition officer shall not
invalidate the motion to quash or modify the subpoena duces tecum but may be
raised by the deposition officer as an affirmative defense in any action for
liability for improper release of records. 
* * *
  “No witness or deposition officer shall be required to
produce personal records after receipt of notice that the motion has been
brought by a consumer . . . except upon order of the court in which the action is
pending or by agreement of the parties, witnesses, and consumers affected. . .
.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1985.3,
subd. (g).) 
As a
general rule, all unprivileged information that is relevant to the subject
matter of the action is discoverable if it would be admissible evidence at
trial or if it appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010; Schnabel v. Superior Court
(1993) 5 Cal.4th 704, 711.) 
When
a party seeks discovery which impacts a person’s constitutional right to privacy,
limited protections come into play. (Shaffer v. Superior Court (1995) 33
Cal.App.4th 993, 999.) The protections cover a person’s personal and financial
matters. (Ibid.) The court must balance competing rights — the litigant’s
right to discover relevant facts and the individual’s right to maintain
reasonable privacy — in determining whether the information is discoverable. (Ibid.) 
For
discovery purposes, information is relevant if it might reasonably assist a
party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement.
(Gonzalez v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Complaint 
The
complaint alleges that on November 19, 2020, as Plaintiff walked through one of
Costco’s stores, she tripped on an empty pallet and fell, suffering injuries. 
B.   Subpoena 
On
December 5, 2023, Costco served a subpoena on deponent requesting the following
documents:  
“ANY AND ALL WRITTEN DISCOVERY REQUESTS PROPOUNDED ON
CYNTHIA HOPES; ANY AND ALL WRITTEN DISCOVERY RESPONSES SERVED BY CYNTHIA HOPES;
ANY AND ALL TRANSCRIPTS OF DEPOSITION AND .RECORDED STATEMENTS OF CYNTHIA
HOPES; PLEADINGS; SIGNED DECLARATIONS; RECORDS, DOCUMENTS, MEDICAL REPORTS,
INCLUDING CASE HISTORY, EMERGENCY ROOM RECORDS, ADMITTING SHEETS, EXAMINATION
RECORDS, INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT RECORDS, DOCTOR'S ENTRIES, NURSES' CHARTS AND
NOTES, FLOWSHEETS, ASSESSMENTS, ORDERS, PROGRESS REPORTS, PHYSICAL THERAPY
RECORDS, SPECIAL TESTS, LAB 3 REPORTS,
MEDICAL SUPPLY RECORDS, X-RAY REPORTS, MRI REPORTS, CT SCAN REPORTS, CT SCANS,
MRl'S, X-RAYS, ULTRASOUND REPORTS, INCLUDING ANY AND ALL FILMS/IMAGES THAT MAY
BE STORED DIGITALLY/ELECTRONICALLY, AND ANY SIGN-IN SHEETS, BUSINESS AND
BILLING FILES PERTAINING TO THE CARE, TREATMENT, DIAGNOSIS, PROGNOSIS,
CONDITION, AND DISCHARGE, EXPERT REPORTS FOR ANY MEDICAL EXAMINATION;
CORRESPONDENCE TO AND FROM ANY MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL AFFECTING OR RELATED TO THE
HEAD, SPINE, AND/OR EXTREMITIES OF CYNTHIA HOPES, DOB: 9/8/1952, SS#:
XXX-XX-2496 LIMITED from 11/19/2010 to present.” 
C.   Plaintiff’s arguments 
Plaintiff
argues the
subpoena is overbroad in time and scope, it violates Plaintiff’s privacy
rights, and it seeks irrelevant medical information.  If the Court declines to quash the subpoena, Plaintiff
requests that the Court narrow its scope to the parts of Plaintiff’s body injured
in her fall and limit responses to five years of records. 
D.   Costco’s opposition 
Costco
argues the subpoena seeks information about injuries Plaintiff suffered in
a July 2021 car accident for which Plaintiff retained attorney Howard Choi to
seek compensation. 
E.   Analysis 
In
written discovery responses served in 2021, Plaintiff denied that, after her
fall at the Costco store, she ever sustained injuries of the kind for which she
is now claiming damages.  (Exh. A to Breuer Dec., Response to Form Interrogatory
10.3.)  Plaintiff also
denied that she had filed any action or made any written claim or demand for
compensation for personal injuries in the last ten years (aside from this
action). (Exh. A to Breuer Dec., Response to Form Interrogatory 11.1.)  At Plaintiff’s 2023 deposition, however,
Costco’s counsel elicited information from Plaintiff about the July 2021 car
accident, including Plaintiff’s agreement that she filed a lawsuit based on the
accident. 
Having
weighed Plaintiff’s privacy rights against Costco’s need for discovery, the
Court finds that Costco is entitled to discover information about the July 2021
car accident, resulting injuries, and medical treatment for those injuries.  The Court therefore denies the motion to the extent it seeks information about Plaintiff’s July
2021 car accident, Plaintiff’s injuries resulting from that accident, and the
medical treatment Plaintiff received for those injuries.  In all other respects, the Court grants the
motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Cynthia Hopes’s motion to quash the subpoena served by
Defendant Costco Wholesale Corporation on the Law Offices of Howard Choi
to the extent the subpoena seeks information
about Plaintiff’s July 2021 car accident, Plaintiff’s injuries resulting from
that accident, and the medical treatment Plaintiff received for those injuries. 
In
all other respects, the Court GRANTS the motion and quashes the subpoena. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
