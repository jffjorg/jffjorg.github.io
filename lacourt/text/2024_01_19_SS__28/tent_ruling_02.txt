Aimee Martinez 
SETTLEMENT:
$8,000.00 
INJURIES:
head, neck and upper back pain, nervousness, cervical sprain/strain,
cervicalgia and thoracic sprain/strain
MEDICAL
EXPENSES: $8,400.70 
COSTS:
$672.24 
ATTORNEY’S
FEES: $2,000.00, which is 25% of the gross settlement 
BALANCE
OF PROCEEDS: $4,222.67 
DISCUSSION 
Issue
1:  Section 13a of the petition states
that medical expenses totaled $8,400.70. 
(Section 13a(1).)  That amount was
reduced by $1,213.36 as the result of negotiated, statutory, or contractual
reduction.  (Section 13a(3).)  This should mean that $7,187.34 (the remaining
amount) would be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  However, the petition states that only
$1,105.09 is to be paid or reimbursed (Section 13a(4)), leaving $6,082.25 in
medical expenses unaccounted for.  The
Court cannot approve a petition to approve a minor’s compromise unless it shows
that all medical expenses that have not been waived or reduced will be
reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
In Attachment
13a, Petitioner states that Medi-Cal paid the providers $273.45 and is seeking reimbursement of $205.09.  Petitioner lists a resulting reduction of
$68.36.  However, if Medi-Cal’s payment
of $273.45 satisfied the Coast Plaza Hospital charge of $6,355.70 (as suggested
by the reference to “CHP Hospital Management” in the Department of Health Care
Services letter), then the reduction amount would be $6,150.61 (for Medi-Cal
and Coast Plaza Hospital) plus $1,145.00 for Dr. Oh
Chiropractic & Acupuncture, for a total reduction amount of $7,295.61.  If the total medical expenses of $8,400.70
were reduced by $7,295.61, then the $1,105.09 figure in Section 13a(4) (the
amount to be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds) would be appropriate.  Petitioner should consider if the reduction
amount can be modified in this way. 
Issue
2: The amount to be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds ($1,105.09
in Section 13a(4)) is smaller than the amount of liens ($2,018.45 in Section
13a(5)), suggesting that the settlement will not completely pay all liens.
The Court cannot approve a petition to approve a minor’s compromise unless it resolves
all outstanding liens. 
Attachment
13a lists liens of $300 (for Petitioner), $205.09 (for Medi-Cal), and $600 (for
Dr. Oh Chiropractic & Acupuncture), for a total lien amount of $1,105.09 –
the same amount as the amount to be reimbursed from the settlement proceeds
(Section 13a(4)).  Petitioner should
consider whether the $2,018.45 figure listed in Section 13a(5) should be replaced
by $1,105.09. 
The
Court denies the petition without prejudice. 
B.
Kimberly Najera 
SETTLEMENT:
$8,000.00 
INJURIES:
head, stomach, neck and back pain, nervousness, cervical sprain/strain,
trapezial strain and thoracic sprain/strain 
MEDICAL
EXPENSES: $9,528.30 
COSTS:
$657.24 
ATTORNEY’S
FEES: $2,000.00, which is 25% of the gross settlement 
BALANCE
OF PROCEEDS: $3,783.21 
DISCUSSION: 
Issue
1: Total medical expenses were $9,528.30.  (Section 13a(1).) 
That amount was reduced by $1,738.18 as the result of negotiated, contractual,
or statutory reductions.  (Section 13a(3).)  This should mean
that $7,790.12 (the remaining amount) would be paid or reimbursed from the
settlement proceeds.  However, Section
13a(4) states that only $1,559.55 is to be
reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
Issue
2: Section 13a(5) lists the lien amount as $2,807.73, which is more than the
amount to be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds ($1,559.55). 
For
both issues, Petitioner should consider whether the information contained in
Attachment 13a can be used to modify the petition along the lines suggested
above for the petition to approve the compromise of Martinez’s case. 
The
Court denies the petition without prejudice.
