 Case Number:  23STCV03122    Hearing Date:   January 19, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
reviewed the unopposed motions to compel responses to form interrogatories, special
interrogatories, and request for production of documents filed by Defendant
Unlimited Security Specialists, Inc. (“Defendant”), the Court rules as follows. 
On
April 25, 2023, Defendant served form interrogatories, set one, special interrogatories,
set one, and request for production of documents, set one, on Plaintiff
Hermenejildo Banuelos (“Plaintiff”). 
Responses
were due on August 22, 2023. Plaintiff failed to provide timely, verified
responses and had not provided responses by the time Defendant filed these
motions. 
The
Court grants the motions to compel responses to the form and special
interrogatories under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (b),
and orders Plaintiff to provide verified responses to the interrogatories
compliant with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.210, subdivision (a), and
2030.220 without objections by February 20, 2024. 
The
Court grants the motion to compel responses to the request for production of
documents under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 and orders Plaintiff
to provide verified responses compliant with Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.210 and to produce the documents, electronically stored information,
and/or other things requested without objections by February 20, 2024. 
Defendant requests monetary sanctions of $1,060.00
for each motion based on 5 hours of attorney’s work at a rate of $200.00 per
hour and 1 $60.00 filing fee. Counsel spent 1 hour meeting and conferring and 3 hours
drafting the motion and anticipated spending 1 hour to attend the hearing.  The motions are substantially similar, they
are unopposed, and they are set to be heard together. The Court awards
sanctions of $980.00 for all of the motions based on 4 hours of attorney’s work
and 3 filing fees.  (See Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2023.030, subd. (a), 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300,
subd. (c).) 
Plaintiff’s
counsel asserts that sanctions should not be imposed on counsel because Plaintiff failed to respond to Defendant's discovery requests due to Plaintiff’s lack of cooperation with counsel. 
The
Court orders Plaintiff to pay Defendant $980.00 in sanctions by February 20, 2024. 
Moving
party is to give notice of this ruling.
