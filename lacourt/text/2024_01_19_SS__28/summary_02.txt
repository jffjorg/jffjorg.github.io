**Significant Statements:** The Court cannot approve a petition to approve a minor's compromise unless it shows that all medical expenses that have not been waived or reduced will be reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. The Court cannot approve a petition to approve a minor's compromise unless it resolves all outstanding liens.

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

Based on the information presented, the Court denies the petition without prejudice. The Court identifies two issues with the petition: (1) the amount to be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds is smaller than the amount of medical expenses, and (2) the amount to be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds is smaller than the amount of liens. The Court suggests that Petitioner consider modifying the petition to reflect the correct amounts.
