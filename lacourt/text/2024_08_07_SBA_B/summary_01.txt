And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has requested that the plaintiff provide a detailed explanation of the claimed defect in their Honda vehicle, which is described as "popping/cracking" in the speakers. The court also wants the plaintiff to clarify what they must prove to establish their basic Song Beverly claim for single damages under Civil Code § 1793.2(d). Specifically, the court is asking whether the plaintiff must show that the manufacturer had some knowledge that a defect existed in any vehicle other than the plaintiff's vehicle in order to establish liability for that defect. The court wishes to distinguish between single damages and civil penalties allowed under Civil Code § 1794(c).
