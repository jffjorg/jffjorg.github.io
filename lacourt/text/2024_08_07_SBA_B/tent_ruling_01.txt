  Case Number:  22TRCV01282    Hearing Date:   August 7, 2024    Dept:  B The Court requests that Plaintiff provide as detailed an
explanation as Plaintiff is presently capable of providing regarding the claimed
defect(s) in the Plaintiff’s Honda vehicle. 
It is described as “popping/cracking” in the speakers.  Plaintiff should attempt to tie the explanation
of the claimed defects to the argument made by Plaintiff in her briefs.
The Court also requests further explanation from Plaintiff
regarding what Plaintiff contends Plaintiff must prove to establish Plaintiff’s
basic Song Beverly claim in order to obtain single damages under Civil Code § 1793.2(d).  (The Court wishes to distinguish between the single
damages and the civil penalty that is allowed under Civil Code § 1794(c).)
Does Plaintiff contend that as part of Plaintiff’s prima
facie claim for single damages under Civil
Code § 1793.2(d) Plaintiff must show that the manufacturer had some
knowledge that a defect existed in any vehicle other than the Plaintiff’s vehicle?  For instance, should the evidence show that
Honda had absolutely no knowledge of the “popping/cracking speaker issues” for
any vehicle other than Plaintiff’s would that be relevant on the question of
Honda’s liability for that “defect” in Plaintiff’s vehicle?  (Do not address the relevance of such
evidence to the issue of civil penalties for a “willful” violation.)
