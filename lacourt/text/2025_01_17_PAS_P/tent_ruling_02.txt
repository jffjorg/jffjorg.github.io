 Case Number:  24NNCV03595    Hearing Date:   January 17, 2025    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT’S
ANTI-SLAPP MOTION and AWARDING MONETARY SANCTIONSI.         INTRODUCTION
On August 15, 2024, Plaintiff Mary Rizzo (“Plaintiff”) initiated this
action against Defendant Stacey Coombes (“Defendant”), asserting seven causes
of action: Defamation, False Light, Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress, Harassment, Invasion of Privacy, Negligent Infliction of Emotional
Distress, and Malicious Prosecution. The parties are former neighbors.
On September 25, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Anti-SLAPP motion.
Plaintiff filed an opposition on January 3, 2025, and Defendant filed a reply
on January 9, 2025. The Court also notes that Plaintiff filed a request for
leave to file a sur-reply on January 10, 2025, and Defendant filed a response
on January 14, 2025.
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
CCP section 425.16 permits the
court to strike causes of action arising from an act in furtherance of the
defendant’s right of free speech or petition unless the plaintiff establishes
that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.
In assessing a defendant’s CCP
section 425.16 special motion to strike, the court must engage in a two-step
process. (Shekhter v. Financial Indem. Co. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 141,
150.) First, the court must decide whether the defendant has met the threshold
burden of showing that the plaintiff’s cause of action arises from the
defendant’s constitutional rights of free speech or petition for redress of grievances.
(Id.) This burden may be met by showing the act which forms the basis
for the plaintiff’s cause of action was an act that falls within one of the
four categories of conduct set forth in section 425.16(e).
Once a defendant has met its
initial burden and established that the anti-SLAPP statute applies, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate a “probability” of success on the
merits. (Code Civ. Proc., §425.16(b); Equilon Enters. LLC v. Consumer Cause,
Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 67.) “[T]he plaintiff must demonstrate that the
complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie
showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by
the plaintiff is credited.” (Matson v. Dvorak (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 539,
548 (internal quotations omitted).) At this “second stage of an anti-SLAPP
hearing, the court may consider affidavits, declarations, and their equivalents
if it is reasonably possible the proffered evidence set out in those statements
will be admissible at trial. Conversely, if the evidence relied upon cannot be
admitted at trial, because it is categorically barred or undisputed factual
circumstances show inadmissibility, the court may not consider it in the face
of an objection. If an evidentiary objection is made, the plaintiff may attempt
to cure the asserted defect or demonstrate the defect is curable.” (Sweetwater
Union High School Dist. v. Gilbane Building Co. (2019) 6 Cal.5th 931, 949.)
The trial court properly considers
the evidentiary submissions of both the plaintiff and the defendant, but it may
not weigh the credibility or comparative strength of the evidence and must
instead simply determine whether the plaintiff's evidence would, if believed by
the trier of fact, be sufficient to result in a judgment for plaintiff. (McGarry
v. Univ. of San Diego (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 97, 108-09.) The court
“accepts as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff and evaluates the
defendant’s evidence only to determine if it has defeated that submitted by the
plaintiff as a matter of law.” (Flatley v. Mauro (2006) 39 Cal.4th 299,
326.) Further, whether or not the evidence is in conflict in the context of a
motion to strike under the anti-SLAPP statute, if the plaintiff has presented a
sufficient pleading and has presented evidence showing that a prima facie case
will be established at trial, the plaintiff is entitled to proceed. (Moore
v. Shaw (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 182, 193.) Only a minimal showing of merit
is required. (Robinzine v. Vicory (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 1416, 1421.)
Request for Judicial notice
Defendant requests Judicial notice of the following
documents:

Request
     for Civil Harassment Restraining Orders. 
Declaration
     of Stacey Coombes 
Declaration
     of Sylvia Laurmann 

The court may take judicial notice
of “official acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial departments of
the United States and of any state of the United States,” “[r]ecords of (1) any
court of this state or (2) any court of record of the United States or of any
state of the United States,” and “[f]acts and propositions that are not
reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate
determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.” (Evid.
Code § 452, subds. (c), (d), and (h).) The Request for Judicial Notice is
DENIED as to Exhibits 1-3.
III.      ANALYSIS
First prong: protected activity
“To prevail on an anti-SLAPP
motion, the movant must first make ‘a threshold showing the challenged cause of
action’ arises from an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free
speech in connection with a public issue.” (Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v.
Delfino (2005) 35 Cal.4th 180, 192.) “A claim arises from protected activity
when that activity underlies or forms the basis for the claim.” (Park v. Board
of Trustees of California State University (2017) 2 Cal.5th 1057, 1062.) “‘[T]
defendant’s act underlying the plaintiff’s cause of action must itself have
been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.’” (Id.
at 1063 (quoting City of Cotati v. Cashman (2002) 29 Cal.4th 69, 78) (emphasis
in original).) “‘[T]he mere fact that an action was filed after protected
activity took place does not mean the action arose from that activity for the
purposes of the anti-SLAPP statute.’” (Id. (quoting Navellier v.
Sletten (2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 89) (alteration in original).) “Instead, the
focus is on determining what ‘the defendant’s activity [is] that gives rise to
his or her asserted liability—and whether that activity constitutes protected
speech or petitioning.’” (Id. (quoting Navellier, supra, 29
Cal.4th at 92) (alteration in original).) “‘The only means specified in section
425.16 by which a moving defendant can satisfy that [‘arising from’]
requirement is to demonstrate that the defendant’s conduct by which plaintiff
claims to have been injured falls within one of the four categories described
in subdivision (e) . . ..’” (Id. (quoting Equilon Enterprises v.
Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 66) (emphasis in original).) “In
short, in ruling on an anti-SLAPP motion, courts should consider the elements
of the challenged claim and what actions by defendant supply those elements and
consequently form the basis for liability.” (Id.)
Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s
complaint arises entirely from protected activity under CCP section 425.16(e).
Specifically, Defendant contends that the actions alleged in the
complaint—contacting law enforcement, Child Protective Services (CPS), and the
building management; filing for a restraining order; and hiring
bodyguards—constitute protected speech and petitioning activity. Defendant
asserts these actions fall squarely under CCP section 425.16(e)(3) and (e)(4),
which protect statements made in connection with an issue of public interest
and conduct furthering the exercise of free speech in connection with a public
issue. (Motion, p. 14)
Defendant highlights that all
alleged actions were undertaken in connection with matters of public concern,
including domestic violence, child welfare, and public safety. Defendant
asserts that communications with law enforcement and CPS about potential child
endangerment and reports of domestic disturbances are inherently matters of
public interest. Defendant argues that courts have consistently held that
issues involving child abuse or safety fall within the scope of protected
activity under CCP section 425.16(e), citing Terry v. Davis Community Church
(2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1534 and Siam v. Kizilbash (2005) 130
Cal.App.4th 1563. (Motion, p.15; Reply p.7)
Next, Defendant contends that the
statements to building management regarding tenant disputes and safety
concerns, as well as the filing of a restraining order, were part of a
legitimate effort to address these public concerns through judicial or quasi-judicial
proceedings. Defendant relies on Navellier v. Sletten (2002) 29 Cal.4th
82 and Briggs v. Eden Council for Hope & Opportunity (1999) 19
Cal.4th 1106, which held that communications made in connection with judicial
or official proceedings are protected under the anti-SLAPP statute. (Motion, p.
14-15)
Defendant further asserts that
Plaintiff’s complaint does not allege specific facts linking the purported
causes of action to unprotected activity. Instead, Defendant characterizes the
complaint as reading more like a novel than a legal pleading, charged with
emotional and speculative assertions. Nevertheless, Defendant contends the
conclusory allegations in the complaint fail to undermine the fact that all of
Defendant’s conduct alleged in the complaint constitutes protected activity
under CCP section 425.16(e). (Motion, p. 16)
The Court finds that Defendant has
met their burden under the first prong of the anti-SLAPP analysis. Defendant
has demonstrated that the alleged actions form the basis of Plaintiff’s claims
and constitute protected activity under CCP section 425.16(e). The burden now
shifts to Plaintiff to establish a probability of prevailing on the merits.
Second prong: probability of prevailing
As Defendant has met their burden
of demonstrating that Plaintiff’s claims arise from protected activity, the
burden shifts to Plaintiff to establish a probability of succeeding on the
merits. (Kyle v. Carmon (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 901, 907.) To meet this
burden, Plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally
sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to
sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by Plaintiff is
credited. (Matson v. Dvorak (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 539, 548.) This
evidentiary showing must consist of competent and admissible evidence. (Morrow
v. Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 1424, 1444.)
In this case, Plaintiff’s
opposition fails to include any evidence demonstrating a probability of
succeeding on the merits for any of the causes of action alleged in the
complaint, including defamation, false light, intentional infliction of
emotional distress, harassment, invasion of privacy, negligent infliction of
emotional distress, or malicious prosecution. Plaintiff provides no
declarations, documents, or other admissible evidence to support their claims
or show that the complaint has legal or factual merit.
Additionally, the Court acknowledges
Plaintiff’s sur-reply request but finds that Plaintiff can address any
arguments raised in the reply during oral arguments. Plaintiff has not
established a prima facie case or met their burden of showing that they are
likely to prevail on the merits.
Given the complete absence of
admissible evidence or substantive arguments addressing the legal and factual
elements of the claims, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not met their burden
of showing a probability of prevailing. 
            Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Defendants motion.
Sanctions
Any defendant who prevails on a
special motion to strike is entitled to mandatory, reasonable attorney fees and
costs. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (c); Ketchum v. Moses¿(2001) 24
Cal.4th 1122, 1141–1142.) The attorney fees and costs recoverable are only
those incurred as to the special motion to strike, and not as to the entire
litigation. (Lafayette Morehouse, Inc. v. Chronicle Pub. Co.
(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1383.) 
Defendant seeks an award of
$8,885.00 in attorney fees and costs incurred in connection with the special
motion to strike. Defendant submits the declaration of Kenneth L. Kazan,
Defendant’s attorney of record, in support of this request. Mr. Kazan declares
that his hourly billing rate is $595.00, which he asserts is reasonable based
on his 43 years of legal experience and the nature of this matter. He further
states that he spent 10 hours reviewing Plaintiff’s complaint, conducting legal
research, and preparing the special motion to strike. (Kazan Decl., ¶¶ 3-7) Mr.
Kazan also anticipates spending an additional 4 hours preparing for and
personally attending the hearing. The total requested attorney fees amount to
$8,330.00 for 14 hours of work. Additionally, Defendant requests $555.00 in
costs, consisting of a $435.00 first appearance fee and a $60.00 motion filing
fee. (Kazan Decl., ¶¶ 3-8)
The Court finds Mr. Kazan’s hourly
rate reasonable given his extensive experience and the straightforward nature
of the motion. However, the Court reduces the total time spent on the motion,
including research, review, and preparation of the motion and reply, by 5
hours. This reduction reflects the Court’s assessment of the reasonable time
required for a motion of this type by an attorney of Mr. Kazan’s experience.
Additionally, the Court grants 1 hour for attending the hearing. In total, the
Court awards 6 hours at $595.00 per hour, amounting to $3,570.00 in attorney
fees, and $60.00 for the motion filing fee.
The Court awards Defendant a total
of $3, 630.00 in attorney fees and costs.
IV.       CONCLUSION AND ORDER
            The Court
GRANTS Defendant’s anti-SLAPP motion and awards Defendant $3,630.00 in monetary
sanctions to be paid within 45 days of this order.
