  Case Number:  23AHCV01404    Hearing Date:   January 17, 2025    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING DEFENDANT’S  DEMURRER TO THE FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION OF THETHIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT WITHOUT  LEAVE TO AMEND I.         INTRODUCTION This is a real property boundary  dispute in which Plaintiffs Ralston C. Riggs and Tina M. Riggs (“Plaintiffs”)  allege a disagreement regarding the boundaries of their property located at  1190 Morada Place, Altadena, California. The dispute arose following a survey  conducted by Defendant Petra Wennberg (“Defendant”) in 2019, which was not  disclosed to Plaintiffs until February 2022. On June 26, 2023, Plaintiffs filed  their First Amended Complaint (FAC). On October 10, 2023, the Court sustained  Defendant’s demurrer to the FAC with leave to amend. Plaintiffs subsequently  filed their Second Amended Complaint (SAC) on April 5, 2024, and on August 16,  2024, the Court again sustained Defendant’s demurrer to the SAC with leave to  amend. Plaintiffs filed their Third Amended Complaint (TAC) on September 19,  2024. Defendant filed the instant demurrer on October 21, 2024, Plaintiffs  filed their opposition on January 6, 2025, and Defendant filed a reply on  January 10, 2025. Meet and Confer Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure  section 430.41, subdivision (a), the demurring party is required to meet and  confer with the party who filed the pleading at least five days before the  responsive pleading is due. This must occur in person, telephone or by video  conference with the aim of resolving any objections raised in the demurrer.  Additionally, the demurring party must file and serve a declaration detailing  the meet and confer efforts. It should be noted, however, that the failure to  meet and confer is not itself grounds for sustaining or overruling a demurrer  or granting or denying a motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, subd.  (a)(4), 435.5, subd. (a)(4).) In this case, Defendant’s counsel  declares that, on October 11, 2024, they emailed Plaintiffs’ counsel a  meet-and-confer correspondence regarding the purported deficiencies in the TAC.  Plaintiffs’ counsel responded on October 20, 2024. (Rocha Decl. ¶¶ 5-6.) The  Court finds that the meet-and-confer requirements have not been fully  satisfied, as the statute mandates that the meet and confer occur in person,  via telephone, or through video conference. Nevertheless, the Court notes that  failure to meet and confer is not, by itself, grounds for sustaining or  overruling a demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, subd. (a)(4); 435.5, subd.  (a)(4).)  II.        LEGAL STANDARD A demurrer tests the legal  sufficiency of a complaint. Donabedian v.  Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994. A plaintiff’s allegations  must be accepted as true for purposes of demurrer, no matter how “improbable”  they are. (Del E. Webb Corp. v.  Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 (Del E. Webb).) Allegations need not be  accepted as true if they are contradicted by judicially noticeable facts. (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224  Cal.App.4th 1462, 1474.)  Pleadings are to be broadly  construed (Code Civ. Proc., § 452) and demurrers are to be overruled where the  facts are sufficient to state any cause of action. (Quelimane Co. v. Stewart  Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38.) Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10,  subdivision (f) provides for a demurrer where a pleading is uncertain. Demurrers  for uncertainty are disfavored and are only sustained where a pleading is so incomprehensible  a defendant cannot reasonably respond. (A.J. Fistes v. GDL Best Contractors,  Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695; Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  III.      ANALYSIS A pleader may not attempt to  breathe life into a complaint by omitting relevant facts which made his  previous complaint defective. See Berman v. Bromberg (1997) 56  Cal.App.4th 936, 946. Moreover, any inconsistencies with prior pleadings must  be explained; if the pleader fails to do so, the court may disregard the  inconsistent allegations. Id.; See also Vallejo Development Co. v.  Beck Development Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 929, 946 (A court is not bound  to accept as true allegations contrary to factual allegations in former  pleading in the same case.); See further Deveny v. Entropin, Inc. (2006)  139 Cal.App.4th 408, 425. The court also has discretion to  deny “sham” amendments, i.e., those that omit or contradict harmful facts  alleged in the original pleading, unless sufficient excuse exists. See Berman  v. Bromberg (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 936, 945 – 946 (Generally, after an  amended pleading has been filed, the court will disregard the original  pleading. However, where the amended complaint attempts to avoid defects set  forth in a prior complaint by ignoring them, the court may examine the prior  complaint to ascertain whether the amended complaint is merely a sham. This  rule is based on the rationale that a pleader may not attempt to breathe life  into a complaint by omitting relevant facts that made the previous complaint  defective.). Defendant argues that Plaintiffs'  first cause of action in the TAC for Agreed-Boundary Doctrine fails because it  contradicts prior verified pleadings and does not state sufficient facts.  Defendant asserts that while the TAC alleges that there was uncertainty  regarding the boundary line when the fences and driveway were constructed in  the 1960s (TAC ¶ 26(a)), prior verified pleadings alleged that the boundary was  known but intentionally adjusted to make the Plaintiffs’ property more  marketable (FAC ¶ 8; SAC ¶ 40). Defendant contends that these  conflicting allegations render the TAC a “sham” amendment intended to avoid  defects in the prior pleadings. Defendant cites Zakk v. Diesel (2019) 33  Cal.App.5th 431, emphasizing that when no explanation is offered for an  inconsistency, the trial court is entitled to conclude the pleading is a sham  and sustain a demurrer without leave to amend. Defendant further argues that  Plaintiffs' TAC may not include contradictory or antagonistic facts, citing Faulkner  v. California Toll Bridge Authority (1953) 40 Cal.2d 317, which held that a  party cannot plead facts that contradict prior verified allegations. Defendant  concludes that these inconsistencies constitute judicial admissions and bar  Plaintiffs from pursuing the Agreed-Boundary Doctrine claim. In opposition, Plaintiffs argue  that the prior verified allegations were made “on information and belief” as  permitted under CCP § 446(a), rather than on personal knowledge, and therefore  do not constitute binding judicial admissions. (Opposition, pp. 1-2) Plaintiffs  assert that their reliance on circumstantial evidence is due to the  unavailability of original parties to the alleged agreement, and they argue  that any inconsistencies are a result of this limited information. (Opposition,  p.3) Plaintiffs further contend that pleadings should be construed liberally to  achieve substantial justice (CCP § 452), and that the TAC adequately pleads the  elements of the Agreed-Boundary Doctrine. In reply, Defendant asserts that  Plaintiffs’ reliance on the claim that prior allegations were made “on  information and belief” lacks any supporting authority and fails to absolve  Plaintiffs of their obligation to provide consistent pleadings. (Reply, pp.2-3)  Defendant argues that this rationale cannot shield Plaintiffs from the legal  consequences of their verified allegations, as the doctrine of judicial  admissions applies regardless of whether the allegations were made on  information and belief. (Id.) The Court agrees with Defendant’s  position, finding Plaintiffs’ explanation inadequate. The Court finds that where no  explanation for an inconsistency between original and amended pleadings is  offered, the trial court is entitled to conclude that the pleading party's  cause of action is a sham and sustain a demurrer without leave to amend (Zakk  v. Diesel (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 431, 245 Cal.Rptr.3d 215). In this  instance, Plaintiffs in the TAC failed to provide any explanation for the  inconsistencies between the FAC, SAC and the TAC. The Court further agrees  that, absent any explanation for the discrepancies, the TAC cannot cure the  defects present in the earlier pleadings. Accordingly, the Court SUSTAINS  Defendant's demurrer as to the first cause of action without leave to  amend.  IV.       ORDER The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer to  the first cause of action of the Third Amended Complaint without leave to  amend.      Defendant to file an answer within 20 days of this order.                         Defendant is  to give notice.    Dated: January 17, 2025                                                                                          JARED D.
