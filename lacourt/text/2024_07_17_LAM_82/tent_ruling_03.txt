[1] Petitioner has not developed an argument that the hearing
officer’s questions at the administrative hearing show advocacy on the part of
the DMV.  He, therefore, forfeits such
argument.  (Nelson, supra, 172 Cal.App.4th at
862-863.)  Regardless, the hearing
officer merely asked Petitioner clarifying questions regarding his contention
that the admonishment was unclear.  (AR 34-35.)
