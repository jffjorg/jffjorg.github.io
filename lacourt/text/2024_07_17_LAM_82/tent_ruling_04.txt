 Case Number:  23STCV07227    Hearing Date:   July 17, 2024    Dept:  82 Prime Electric
Wholesale Corporation v. Ara Petrosyan, et al.
Case No.
23STCV07227
[Tentative] Order
Denying Motion to Release Attachment
 
            Plaintiff
Prime Electric Wholesale Corporation (“Plaintiff”) filed this breach of
contract action against LA Solar Group, Inc. (“LA Solar”) and Ara Petrosyan (“Petrosyan”).  Plaintiff alleges that LA Solar breached the
contract by failing to pay $327,496.14. 
Plaintiff alleges a breach of a personal guaranty against Petrosyan as the
fifth cause of action.  
 
On December 20, 2023, the court
(Beckloff, J.) issued writs of attachment against Petrosyan and LA Solar.  The writ against LA Solar was in the amount
of $266,988.44 based upon the following calculations: (1) An invoice to LA
Solar in the amount of $316,885.28; (2) A credit of $70,881.54; (3) A filing
fee of $435; (4) Service of process fees of $549.70; and (5) Attorney’s fees of
$20,000. The writ against Petrosyan was in the same amount based upon
Petrosyan’s guaranty agreement, which included interest, so Judge Beckloff
added an additional $50,841.79, for a total of $317,820.23. It appears that
Judge Beckloff intended the writs of attachment to be joint and several because
they are based upon the same damages (except the additional interest against
Petrosyan).
 
On April 9, 2024, the parties
modified the writ of attachment against Petrosyan to release his house for sale
on the condition that Plaintiff receives the excess proceeds and agrees to
reduce the writ by a commensurate amount.  The parties confirmed that Plaintiff received
$265,391.94 from the sale, leaving $52,428.29 on the writ of attachment against
Petrosyan.  The Sheriff’s Department has
levied an account with $155,298.08. Defendants seek to release $102,869.79,
arguing that the writs are joint and several.
 
The court agrees with Defendants’
counsel that the writs of attachment were intended to be joint and several,
which means that both writs would be satisfied once $317,820.23 is
attached.  That has occurred.  Nevertheless, the court denies Defendants’
motion to release attachment of the excess funds.  When the parties stipulated to modify the
writ of attachment against Ara Petrosyan (in the amount of $317,820.33), they
agreed that “[t]he writ of attachment against LA Solar Group, Inc., dated
January 23, 2024, in the amount of $266,988.44 shall not be affected by this
order.”  (See Court’s Order, dated April
9, 2024.)  Thus, the following amounts
remain subject to attachment: (1) $52,428.29 on the writ of attachment against Petrosyan,
and (2) $266,988.44 on the writ against LA Solar.  The account with $155,298.09 does not exceed
these amounts. 
 
Based upon the foregoing, the court
orders as follows:
 
1.         Defendants’
motion to release attachment of $102,869.89 is denied.
 
2.         Plaintiff’s
counsel shall provide notice and file proof of service with the court.
