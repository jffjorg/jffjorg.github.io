And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion to release attachment of excess funds. The parties had agreed to modify the writ of attachment against Ara Petrosyan to release his house for sale, with the excess proceeds reducing the writ by a commensurate amount. After the sale, the writ against Petrosyan was reduced to $52,428.29, and the defendants seek to release $102,869.79 of these excess funds. The court agrees that the writs of attachment were intended to be joint and several, but denies the motion because the parties previously stipulated that the writ against LA Solar Group, Inc. would not be affected by the modification of the writ against Petrosyan. As a result, the writs of attachment against Petrosyan and LA Solar remain in effect, and the defendants' motion is denied.
