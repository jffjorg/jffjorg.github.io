And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Shakara N. Johnson v. Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles. The case concerns the termination of Shakara's Section 8 housing benefits, which was effective May 31, 2024. Shakara filed an ex parte application to stay the termination and it is scheduled for a hearing on July 17, 2024. However, due to the general counsel for HACLA being out-of-the-office until July 17, 2024, the Judge has decided to advance and continue the hearing to July 22, 2024. The Judge has also ordered Petitioner's counsel and counsel for HACLA to meet-and-confer on or before July 17, 2024, to discuss whether HACLA intends to oppose the ex parte application or stipulate for relief. HACLA is required to file an opposition or notice of non-opposition by July 18, 2024.
