N. Johnson v. Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles, et al., Case No.
24STCP02218
 THIS
HEARING IS BEING CONTINUED.  THE PARTIES
SHOULD NOT APPEAR ON JULY 17, 2024
Respondent
terminated Petitioner’s Section 8 housing benefits, effective May 31,
2024.  Petitioner filed the instant case on July 12, 2024, and then filed
an ex parte application to stay the decision to terminate benefits under Code
of Civil Procedure section 1094.5(g), which was noticed for hearing on July 17,
2024.  Petitioner provided notice to HACLA’s general counsel, among
others, but he is out-of-the-office until July 17, 2024.  It is unclear
whether Respondent intends to oppose this ex parte application or whether there
will be a stipulation for relief as in past such cases.  
 
Based
upon the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
1.      
The hearing on Petitioner’s ex parte application is advanced and continued to
Monday, July 22, 2024, at 9:30 a.m.
 
2.      
The court orders Petitioner’s counsel and counsel for HACLA to meet-and-confer
via telephone on or before July 17, 2024, on the issue whether Respondent will
oppose this ex parte application or whether there will be a stipulation for
relief as in past such cases.  
 
3.      
Respondent shall file an opposition or notice of non-opposition on or before
July 18, 2024.
 
4.      
The court’s clerk shall serve this order upon Petitioner’s counsel via email. 
 
5.      
Petitioner’s counsel shall provide notice to all parties who received a copy of
the ex parte application forthwith.  Petitioner’s counsel shall file a
proof of service forthwith.
