 Case Number:  23STCV22347    Hearing Date:   March 12, 2024    Dept:  74 You Hyuck Lim v. Aviators, Inc., et
al.
Defendants’ Motion to Strike
The court considered the moving
papers, opposition, and reply.
BACKGROUND
            This
action arises from an employment dispute.
            On
September 15, 2023, Plaintiff You Hyuck Lim (Plaintiff) filed a complaint
against Defendants Aviators, Inc. and Blake Purdy (Defendants).
            On December 8, 2023, Defendants
filed this motion to strike.
LEGAL STANDARD
            A court may strike any “¿irrelevant,
false or improper matter¿inserted in any pleading¿” or any part of a pleading
“¿not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule,
or an order of the court.¿” (¿Code Civ. Proc., § 436¿.) “¿The grounds for a
motion to strike shall appear on the face of the challenged pleading or from
any matter of which the court is required to take judicial notice.¿” (¿Code
Civ. Proc., § 437¿.)¿     
DISCUSSION  
            Defendants
seek to strike portions of the complaint that request punitive damages: page
14, paragraph 77; page 15, paragraph 84; page 15, paragraph 91; and page 16,
paragraph (c). According to Defendants, Plaintiff’s complaint contains
insufficient facts to support a request for punitive damages. Under Civil Code
section 3294, subdivision (a), a plaintiff may recover punitive damages if the
plaintiff proves by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been
guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. Malice in this context can mean conduct
that is intended to cause injury to the plaintiff. (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd.
(c)(1).) 
            Here,
Plaintiff alleges specific facts to support his request for punitive damages
based on his claims for retaliation in violation of Labor section 98.6,
retaliation in violation of Labor Code section 1102.5, and wrongful termination
in violation of public policy. That is, Plaintiff alleges he complained to
Defendants that they had unlawfully deducted items from Plaintiff’s paystubs.
(Complaint, ¶ 38.) Defendants allegedly terminated Plaintiff because of his
complaints. (Complaint, ¶ 39.) These allegations, if true, suggest Defendants
intended to cause injury to Plaintiff and therefore acted with malice. The
court further notes that Labor Code section 98.6 does not preclude the recovery
of punitive damages. (Lab. Code, § 98.6, subd. (b)(3) [“In addition to other
remedies available, an employer who violates this section is liable for a civil
penalty […].”].) Moreover, punitive damages are recoverable for a violation of
Labor Code section 1102.5. (Mathews v. Happy Valley Conference Center, Inc. (2019)
43 Cal.App.5th 236, 267.) Last, wrongful termination in violation of public
policy can support an award of punitive damages. (See Smith v. Brown-Forman
Distillers Corp. (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 503, 512-513, 516.) 
CONCLUSION 
            The
court denies Defendants’ motion to strike.
            Defendants
shall give notice.
