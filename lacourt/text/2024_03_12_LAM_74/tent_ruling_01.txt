  Case Number:  21STCV28191    Hearing Date:   March 12, 2024    Dept:  74 Kevin
Blackman v. Transdev Services, Inc., et al.
Defendants’ Motion to File Under
Seal Documents Filed in Support of Plaintiff’s Opposition to Defendants’ Motion
for Summary Judgment and Defendants’ Reply.
 
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from an employment dispute. 
            On
July 30, 2021, Plaintiff Kevin Blackman (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against
Transdev Services, Inc., Transdev North America, Inc., and Timothy Grensavitch (Defendants).
            On
February 23, 2023, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.
            On
May 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed his opposition to the motion for summary judgment.
            On
November 17, 2023, Defendants filed their reply.
            On
January 22, 2024, Defendants filed this motion to seal portions of documents
filed with Plaintiff’s opposition and Defendants’ reply.
LEGAL STANDARD
            Unless confidentiality is required
by law, court records are presumed to be open to the public. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 2.550, subd. (c).) Consequently, pleadings, motions, evidence, and
other papers may not be filed under seal merely by stipulation of the parties;
rather, a prior court order is necessary. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551,
subd. (a).) 
            To
grant such an order, the court must expressly find that . . . “an overriding
interest exists that overcomes the right of public access to the record, an
overriding interest supports sealing the records, a substantial probability
exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not
sealed, the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored, and no less restrictive
means exist to achieve the overriding interest.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.550, subd. (d).) 
            If
the court fails to make the required findings, the order is deficient and
cannot support sealing. (Overstock.com, Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (2014)
231 Cal.App.4th 471, 487.) 
DISCUSSION  
Identities of Third-Party Employees
            In their motion, Defendants first
seek to seal portions of documents that disclose the names of third-party
employees. The court finds that a legitimate interest supports this sealing. As
Defendants note, courts recognize a right to privacy in confidential personnel
information. (El Dorado Savings & Loan Assn. v.
Superior Court (1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 342, 346, disapproved on other grounds
in Williams v. Superior Court (20170 3 Cal.5th 531.) This interest
overrides that of the public in access to the names of the third-party
employees. And it goes without saying that this interest will be compromised if
the names remain unsealed and open to the public. Last, the court finds the
sealing of the following documents sufficiently narrow tailored:

Irrelevant Information About
Third-Party Employees
 
            In addition, Defendants seek to seal
private information about third-party employees that the parties do not rely on
in their opposition and reply. To that end, Defendants note the third-party
employees’ privacy interest in documents concerning their employment with
Defendants. (El Dorado Savings & Loan Assn. v. Superior Court, supra,
190 Cal.App.3d at p. 246.) This interest overrides that of the public in access
to the names of the third-party employees, especially since the parties do not
rely on the information in their opposition and reply. And it goes without
saying that this interest will be compromised if the names remain unsealed and
open to the public. Last, the court finds the sealing of the following
documents sufficiently narrow tailored:
