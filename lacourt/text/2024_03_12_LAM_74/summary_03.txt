And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court denies the defendants' motion to strike the portions of the complaint that request punitive damages. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's complaint contains insufficient facts to support a request for punitive damages, but the court finds that the plaintiff has alleged specific facts to support his request based on his claims for retaliation in violation of Labor Code sections 98.6 and 1102.5, and wrongful termination in violation of public policy. The court notes that Labor Code section 98.6 does not preclude the recovery of punitive damages, and that punitive damages are recoverable for a violation of Labor Code section 1102.5. Additionally, the court finds that wrongful termination in violation of public policy can support an award of punitive damages.
