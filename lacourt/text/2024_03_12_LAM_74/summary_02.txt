And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering a motion for a preliminary injunction filed by the People of the State of California against Ultimate Host, LLC and others. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants have violated California's unfair competition law and public nuisance by operating multiple short-term rental properties, hosting loud parties, and engaging in other illegal activities. The judge finds that the Plaintiff has demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on the merits and that the balance of harm tips in the Plaintiff's favor. Therefore, the judge grants the Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction and will sign the proposed order. The injunction will enjoin the Defendants from engaging in certain activities, including hosting events or parties that violate the Party House Ordinance, until the matter is resolved.
