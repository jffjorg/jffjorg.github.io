And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The court has granted the defendant's motion to continue the hearing on the plaintiff's motion to quash service of summons and complaint. The court has also taken into consideration the financial deposit arrangement between the parties, which suggests that the defendant intentionally invoked the benefits and protections of California's laws. The court has cited relevant case law, including Federal Dep. Ins. Corp. v. British-American Ins. Co. Ltd. and Hydrokinetics, Inc. v. Alaska Mech., Inc., to support its conclusion. The court has determined that the defendant did not purposefully avail itself of the privilege of conducting business within California or invoke the benefits and protections of California law. The hearing is now scheduled for May 24, 2024."
