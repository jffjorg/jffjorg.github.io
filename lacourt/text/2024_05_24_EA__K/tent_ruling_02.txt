instant motion was filed (and served via email) on March 20, 2024 and
originally set for hearing on May 2, 2024. On April 30, 2024, the court granted
B.R.’s “Ex Parte Application for an Order Continuing the Hearing on Twain GL
XXV, LLC’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons and Complaint” and continued the
hearing to May 24, 2024; notice was waived.

As an aside, the court addresses B.R. Resources’ contention that the
arrangement of a financial deposit with B.R. Resources “demonstrates a
deliberate invocation of the benefits and protections of California’s laws.”
(Opp., 2:23-26). As Twain points out, the evidence suggests that Ahlholm
instructed Twain to send the money to B.R. Resources. (Banos Decl., ¶ 16, Exh.
C.) (Fed. Dep. Ins. Corp. v. British-American Ins. Co. Ltd. (9th
Cir. 1987) 828 F.2d 1026, 1029 [“This circuit has recognized that the receipt
of payment alone for services rendered outside the forum state is not
sufficient to support personal jurisdiction;” see also Hydrokinetics, Inc.
v. Alaska Mech., Inc. (5th Cir. 1983) 700 F.2d 1026, 1029 [We agree with the
district court's conclusion that Alaska Mechanical did not purposefully avail
itself of the privilege of conducting business within Texas or invoke the
benefits and protections of Texas law . . . no performance by Alaska Mechanical
was to take place in Texas, other than perhaps the payment for the goods. .
. Nor do we weigh heavily the fact that Alaska Mechanical may have mailed
payment checks into the forum state in exchange for the goods. . .”].)
