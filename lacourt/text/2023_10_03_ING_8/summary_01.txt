And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses four motions: (1) Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production, (2) Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Admission, (3) Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories, and (4) Request for Sanctions.

The judge grants the motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories 2.5, but denies the motion to compel further responses to Requests for Production Nos. 1-4 and Requests for Admission Nos. 1-7 and 26-29. The judge will entertain oral argument on the relevance of the requests for admission.

The judge also denies the request for sanctions, finding that each side has presented a bona fide basis for its position and that the imposition of sanctions would be unjust.

The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2017.010, 2017.020, 2030.010, 2030.210, 2030.300, 2031.310, and 2033.290, as well as California Corporations Code section 1601.
