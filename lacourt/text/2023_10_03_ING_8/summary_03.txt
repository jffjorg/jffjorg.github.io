And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by the defendants, Willie Bell and Maura Bell, against the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Louis A. Sparks, Jr. The plaintiff filed a complaint alleging murder, but the complaint is uncertain and fails to state sufficient causes of action. The Judge finds that the complaint does not contain factual allegations, but instead attaches multiple documents. The Court cannot gather what exactly the plaintiff is alleging. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure ยง 430.10(f), the demurrer may be brought for uncertainty when the complaint is ambiguous and unintelligible. The Judge orders the plaintiff to file and serve a First Amended Complaint within 30 days, which must contain factual allegations in sentence or paragraph form.
