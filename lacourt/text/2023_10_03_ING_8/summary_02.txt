Significant Statements:
  - "The Motion refences several provisions of the California Penal Code, including the forgery statute, which are definitions of crimes rather than grounds for dismissal of a civil case."
  - "A contract defense can be proof by the defendant that the claimed promissory note attached to the First Amended Complaint is a forgery, but claiming it is so and proving the forgery requires proof, not mere assertions in a brief."
  - "The Court cannot determine if the motion to dismiss is actually a demurrer, which if it were then the demurrer would be overruled because Mr. Henry previously filed a General Denial so his right to file a demurrer has expired, and because the First Amended Complaint contains sufficient allegations of the four causes of action asserted."

And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to dismiss and/or motion for summary judgment. The defendant, who is representing himself, argued that there was no triable issue of material fact and that the plaintiff's claims were fraudulent. However, the judge found that the defendant failed to carry his burden of proof and that the motion was procedurally defective. The judge noted that the defendant's exhibits were not authenticated and that he failed to provide a separate statement of undisputed material facts. The judge also found that the plaintiff's claims were not fraudulent and that there were triable issues of material fact. As a result, the judge denied the motion for summary judgment and ordered the plaintiff to give notice.
