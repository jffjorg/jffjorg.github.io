And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to dismiss and/or motion for summary judgment. The defendant, who is representing himself, argued that there was no triable issue of material fact and that the plaintiff's claims were fraudulent. However, the judge found that the defendant failed to carry his burden of proof and that the motion was procedurally defective. The judge noted that the defendant's exhibits were not authenticated and that he failed to provide a separate statement of undisputed material facts. The judge also found that the plaintiff's claims were not fraudulent and that there were triable issues of material fact. As a result, the judge denied the motion for summary judgment and ordered the plaintiff to give notice.
