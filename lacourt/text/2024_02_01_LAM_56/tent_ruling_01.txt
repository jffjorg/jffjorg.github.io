AND RELATED
CROSS-ACTIONS
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Estate of George E. Gutierrez, Deceased
(“Moving Defendant”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiffs
 
The Court has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers.
 
BACKGROUND
This action arises out of a landlord/tenant relationship.  Plaintiffs’ complaint (the “Complaint”)
alleges: (1) breach of implied warranty of habitability; (2) breach of
statutory warranty of habitability; (3) breach of the covenant of quiet
enjoyment; (4) negligence; (5) violation of Civil Code section 1942.4; and (6)
private nuisance.
 
 
On December 5, 2023, Moving Defendant filed a demurrer (the
“Demurrer”) to the second and sixth causes of action on the grounds that the
Complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action and
is uncertain. 
 
DISCUSSION
Meet and Confer
The meet and
confer requirement has been met.
 
Legal Standard
A demurrer tests
the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law.  (Durell
v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)  The court accepts as true all material
factual allegations and affords them a liberal construction, but it does not
consider conclusions of fact or law, opinions, speculation, or allegations
contrary to law or judicially noticed facts. 
(Shea Homes Limited Partnership v.
County of Alameda (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1246, 1254.)  With respect to a demurrer, the complaint
must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from the facts
pleaded.  (Rodas v. Spiegel (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 513, 517.)  Demurrers for uncertainty are
disfavored.  (Chen v. Berenjian (2019)
33 Cal.App.5th 811, 822.)  A demurrer for
uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects
uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.  (Id.)  A demurrer will be sustained without leave to
amend if there exists no reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  
 
 
Second Cause of Action: Breach
of Statutory Duty of Habitability 
Under Civil Code
section 1941, the lessor of a building intended for the occupation of human
beings must, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, put it into a
condition fit for such occupation, and repair all subsequent dilapidations
thereof, which render it untenantable. 
(Civ. Code § 1941.)
 
The second cause of action alleges that Defendants breached
the warranty of habitability set forth under Civil Code section 1941 by failing
to ensure that the building complied with the requirements enumerated in Civil
Code section 1941.1 and Health and Safety Code section 17290.3.  (See Complaint ¶ 14.)
 
Moving Defendant argues that the second cause of action is
insufficient because Civil Code sections 1941 and 1041.1 and Health and Safety
Code section 17290.3. do not provide for a private right of action, and the
claim is otherwise duplicative of the negligence and violation of Civil Code
section 1942.4 causes of action.  The
Court agrees.  Civil Code section 1942.4
establishes the framework for redress for violations of the habitability
conditions listed in Civil Code section 1941.1 and Health and Safety Code
section 17290.3.  (See Civ. Code §
1942.4.)  The Court therefore SUSTAINS
the Demurrer to the second cause of action with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
 
 
Sixth Cause of Action: Private
Nuisance
Anything which is injurious to health, or is indecent or offensive to
the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere
with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property, or unlawfully obstructs the
free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river,
bay, stream, canal, or basin, or any public park, square, street, or highway,
is a nuisance.  (Civ. Code § 3479.)  To state a claim for private nuisance, the
plaintiff must allege: (1) interference with his land or property; (2) substantial
actual damage which is (3) unreasonable as to its nature, duration or
amount.  (San
Diego Gas & Electric Co. v. Superior Court (1996) 13 Cal.4th 893, 937-38.)
 
Moving Defendant argues that the nuisance
claim is redundant to the negligence claim. 
Plaintiffs concede this argument. 
The Court therefore SUSTAINS the Demurrer to the sixth cause of action
without leave to amend. 
 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of this
ruling.
