And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the Estate of George E. Gutierrez, Deceased (Moving Defendant) to the second and sixth causes of action in a lawsuit brought by OSCAR VALENCIA, et al. (Plaintiffs) alleging breach of implied warranty of habitability, breach of statutory warranty of habitability, breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, negligence, violation of Civil Code section 1942.4, and private nuisance.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action for breach of statutory warranty of habitability, finding that the claim is duplicative of the negligence and violation of Civil Code section 1942.4 causes of action, and granting the Moving Defendant 20 days leave to amend the complaint.

The judge has also sustained the demurrer to the sixth cause of action for private nuisance, finding that the claim is redundant to the negligence claim and that the Plaintiffs concede this argument. The judge has denied the Moving Defendant leave to amend the complaint with respect to this cause of action.

The judge has ordered the Moving Defendant to give notice of this ruling and has instructed the parties to submit on this tentative and to send an email to the court if they intend to appear at the hearing.
