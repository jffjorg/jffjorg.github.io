And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court is considering a motion for attorney's fees filed by Defendant Lisa Marie Vernola Salas, as authorized Co-Special Administrator on behalf of the Estate of Luigi Antonio Vernola. The motion seeks to recover $167,078 in attorney's fees incurred in defending this action. The Court finds that Moving Defendant has demonstrated a statutory basis for seeking attorney's fees, as the contract at the heart of the Complaint was a donative transfer subject to the presumption of fraud that Plaintiff failed to rebut.

The Court also finds that Moving Defendant has provided reasonable evidence of the fees incurred, including counsel's hourly rate and the hours of work performed. Therefore, the Court grants the motion and awards $164,970 in attorney's fees, subject to adjustment based on the Court's consideration of factors specific to the case.
