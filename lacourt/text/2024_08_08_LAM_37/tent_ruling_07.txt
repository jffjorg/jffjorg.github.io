Background
 
On May 17, 2023, Lucy Broadbent; David Norland; Steven, Shirley,
and Eriq Quat; Julia Ganis; Scott Leslie; Denise and Jeff Turzo; Pouri Fox and
Brandon Fox, and Anthony Ivanich (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint
against 3585 Multiview, LLC (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 50. 
 
Plaintiffs allege that Defendant’s construction efforts in an
upslope property caused mudslides and damages to Plaintiffs’ respective
properties. The Complaint alleges three causes of action: (1) Negligence, (2)
Nuisance, and (3) Trespass. 
 
On July 20, 2023, Defendant filed a demurrer to the Plaintiffs’
Complaint. On October 31, 2023, the court overruled the demurrer in its
entirety. 
 
On March 28, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the operative First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”) alleging the same three causes of action and adding
Defendants Ruben Sangalang and Virginia Kho Ting Casabar to this action. 
 
Defendants now demurrer to the FAC and move to strike the FAC.
Plaintiffs oppose the motions. The matter is now before the court. 
 
Demurrer[1]
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
A.        Demurrer 
 
A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(CCP § 430.30(a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)¿“To
survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.”¿(C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High
School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) ¿For the purpose of
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth
of all material facts properly pleaded.¿ (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992)
2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.)¿A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.”¿(Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67
Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿ 
 
B.        Motion to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP, § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP § 436(a)-(b); Stafford
v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not
essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be
stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
C.        Leave to Amend 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
 
 
II.        Discussion 
 
Defendants demur to
the first, second, and third causes of action on the basis that Defendants
actions did not cause the landslide, hence Plaintiffs’ claims for negligence,
nuisance, and trespass fail. 
 
In support of their
contention that Defendants are not responsible for the mudslide/landslide,
Defendants attach the Declarations of Ricky Dela Cruz and Theida Salazar.
Instead of challenging the sufficiency of the FAC, Defendants challenge the
fact that they are responsible for the mudslide/landslide by introducing
evidence that is outside the pleadings and reciting facts as Defendants
perceive them to be.  “[D]efendants
cannot set forth allegations of fact in their demurrers which, if true, would
defeat plaintiff's complaint.” (Gould v. Maryland Sound Industries, Inc. (1995)
31 Cal.App.4th 1137, 1144 citing Fuhrman v. California Satellite Systems
(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 408, 422–423.) Nevertheless, Defendants’ demurrer states:

 
In this Demurrer, Defendants will provide
declarations and records establishing that the allegations are blatantly false
and fail to state any claim against Defendants. Defendants refutes Plaintiffs’
erroneous assertions and statements.
 
(Demurrer, at p.
7:27-8:2.)
 
Defendants has demonstrated and evidence that it
has no liability issues in this matter as well as the fact that there is no
evidence that can change the fact that there is no evidence supporting
Plaintiffs’ causes of action thereby destroying all allegations stated within
the FAC. 
 
(Demurrer, at p.
13:18-21.) 
 
“The hearing on
demurrer may not be turned into a contested evidentiary hearing through the
guise of having the court take judicial notice of documents whose truthfulness
or proper interpretation are disputable.” (Fremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont
General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 114 .) By submitting declarations
and evidence, Defendants are asking the court to look beyond the allegations in
the FAC and take the Defendants' facts true. For purposes of a demurrer, the
material facts alleged in the pleadings are taken as true, regardless of
whether Plaintiffs will be able to prove the pleaded facts. (See Stevens v.
Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.) The truth of the facts
and evidence presented in Defendants’ declarations remains subject to dispute.
The proper forum to challenge Plaintiffs’ evidence is not via demurrer but via
a motion for summary judgment after all discovery has been completed. 
 
Lastly, Defendants
assert that in amending the Complaint, “Plaintiffs made minor, seemingly, name
changes, erred description and adding parties rather than editing the claims
within the original complaint.” (Demurrer, at p. 4:7-8.) 
 
The court notes
that on October 31, 2023, the court overruled the Defendants’ demurrer to the
Complaint as to all three causes of action. The court sees no reason to sustain
Defendants’ demurrer because Defendants failed to show that the pleadings are
legally deficient. 
 
The demurrer is
overruled. 
 
Plaintiffs’ request
for sanctions under CCP § 177.5 is also denied. 
 
motion to strike
 
Defendants seek to
strike the term “undercapitalization” from the FAC on the basis that the term
is misleading and false. Defendants allege that the use of the term
“undercapitalization” constitutes slander and defamation. (Motion, at p.
7:21-15.) Defendants fail to explain how the use of the word “undercapitalized”
results in “Defendants are being described as impoverished and mediocre who are
ostracized from the community.” (Motion, at p. 8:1-2.)
 
Plaintiffs assert
the allegation Defendant 3585 N. Multiview, LLC is “undercapitalized” is
necessary to pierce the corporate veil. Plaintiffs further assert that the
allegations in the FAC must be taken as true for purposes of a motion to
strike. “In passing on the correctness of a ruling on a motion to strike,
judges read allegations of a pleading subject to a motion to strike as a whole,
all parts in their context, and assume their truth.” (Clauson v. Superior
Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255.)
 
The motion to
strike is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants’ demurrer to the FAC is
overruled in its entirety. Defendants’ motion to strike is 
denied. Defendants must file an Answer by
August 19, 2024.  The Court schedules an
OSC Re: 
Filing of Answer August 28, 2024, and
continues the CMC to the same date and time. 

Defendants to give notice.
