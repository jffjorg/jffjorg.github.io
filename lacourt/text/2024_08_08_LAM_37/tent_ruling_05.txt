Background
 
On April 27, 2023, Brock and Sam Barrett
and Maurice Dupre (collectively “Plaintiffs”), filed a Complaint against
Mauricio Menache as an individual and trustee of the Mauricio Menache Revocable
Living Trust dated January 28, 2022; Alexandra Menache (collectively
“Defendants”); and Does 1 to 10. 
 
The operative First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”), filed December 21, 2023, alleges ten causes of action: (1) breach of
written contract, (2) breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, (3) breach of
implied warranty of habitability, (4) trespass, (5) negligence, (6) nuisance,
(7) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealings, (8) breach of
the tenant anti-harassment ordinance, (9) 
breach of Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, and (10) intentional infliction
of emotional distress. 
 
On February 16, 2024, Defendants filed a
demurrer with a motion to strike. The Court overruled the demurrer as to the
fourth cause of action for trespass, eighth cause of action for breach of the
Tenant Anti-Harassment Ordinance, ninth cause of action for breach of Bus.
& Prof. Code §  17200, tenth cause of
action for IIED, and sustained the demurrer with leave to amend as to the fifth
cause of action for negligence and sixth cause of action for nuisance.
Defendants’ motion to strike was granted with leave to amend.
 
On April 15, 2024, the Plaintiffs filed
the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) alleging the same ten causes of
action as the FAC. Defendants now move to strike the SAC’s request for punitive
damages. Plaintiffs oppose the Motion. The matter is now before the court.

strike second amended complaint[1]
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP § 436(a)-(b); Stafford
v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not
essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be
stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Discussion
 
Defendants request
that the following be stricken from the SAC: 
 
1)    
Page 2, paragraph 4, lines 15-17;
2)    
Page 24, paragraph 140, lines 5-7;
3)    
Page 28, paragraph 166, lines 8-11;
4)    
Page 32, paragraph 183, lines 1-3;
5)    
Page 33, paragraph 194, lines 12-13;
6)    
Page 34, paragraph 3, line 14;
7)    
Page 34, paragraph 3, line 25;
8)    
Page 35, paragraph 3, line 15; and
9)    
 Page 36, paragraph 3, line 5.
The SAC alleges that the Plaintiffs
are tenants who have the exclusive right to possession of the Subject Property
because it is not an apartment complex but a private residence with enclosed
private grounds that are for the exclusive use of tenants. (SAC, ¶ 19.) “‘Unless
specifically reserved to the landlord by the terms of the lease, everything
that belongs to the demised premises or is used with, or is appurtenant to, the
premises, and reasonably necessary for their beneficial use and enjoyment,
passes as an incident to a lease of the premises. Thus, appurtenances that are
reasonably essential for the beneficial use of the demised premises are
included in the property transferred by the lease under the assumption that the
parties intended that they be used by the tenant.’ [Citation]” (Dubin v. Robert Newhall Chesebrough Trust (2002) 96
Cal.App.4th 465, 473.) The SAC asserts that Plaintiffs’ Lease Agreements do not
reserve for Defendants control or possession over any part of the property and
Defendants do not retain control over any area of the Subject Property. (SAC, ¶
21, Ex. 1 to 3.)
 
The SAC generally
alleges that Defendants, through Defendant Mauricio Menache (“Mauricio”),
engaged in a campaign to harass Plaintiffs so that they would abandon their
tenancy by disrupting Plaintiffs’ possessory rights and right to quiet
enjoyment. (SAC, ¶¶ 27, 34, 73.) In March 2023, Defendant
Mauricio installed audio monitoring surveillance
to stalk and harass Plaintiffs despite Plaintiffs already having cameras
installed. (SAC, ¶¶ 73, 74.) Plaintiffs allege that installation was without
their consent and the surveillance was placed in a location where there was a
reasonable expectation of privacy. (SAC, ¶¶ 135(a), 174.)
“Landscaping” conducted at the direction of Defendant Mauricio resulted in a
ruptured gas line. (SAC, ¶ 61.) Defendant Mauricio canceled the plumber
scheduled to repair and restore the gas line, made no effort no effort to
restore the gas line promptly, ignored Plaintiffs’ request for a prompt repair,
and left the Plaintiffs without natural gas for one and one-half months. (SAC,
¶¶ 64-67.) 
 
On December 20, 2022,
Defendants caused two 3-Day Notices to Perform Covenants or Quit that were
frivolous. (SAC, ¶¶ 69-70, Ex. 6-7.) On January 17, 2023, Defendants filed an
Unlawful Detainer (“UD”) action against Plaintiffs for an at-fault eviction
based on the 3-Day Notices. (SAC, ¶¶ 71-72, Ex. 8-9.) On May 31, 2023,
Defendant Mauricio posted two 3-Day Notices to quit the Subject Property for
unpaid rent despite the fact the UD action was pending, and the payment of rent
was suspended. (SAC, ¶ 89, Ex. 11, 12.) On June 7, 2023, Defendant Mauricio through
counsel filed a request for dismissal to the UD action and Plaintiffs paid all
accrued rent. (SAC, ¶ 90, Ex. 13, 14.) Nevertheless, on January 16, 2024,
Defendant filed a second UD action which was again voluntarily dismissed by
Defendant. (SAC, ¶¶ 106-11).
 
On March 28, 2023, Defendants
issued a 30-day Notice of Removal of “Tenant Parking” requiring Plaintiffs to
vacate their gated parking spaces, the entire double garage storage and
workplace area, to vacate the gated car port and limited Plaintiffs access to
the laundry facilities. (SAC, ¶ 75.) “[T]he Entry Accesses of both
rental units are located inside this gated carport, the enforcement of these
notices would remove all tenant vehicle access to the property thereby
preventing Plaintiffs from gaining reasonable access to their units.” (SAC, ¶
75.) 
 
On July 28, 2023, Defendant
Mauricio posted a 3-day Notice alleging that Plaintiffs had violated the Lease
for the Front Unit by using the garage as storage despite the Estoppel
Certificate stating that Plaintiffs had the right to use the garage for
storage. (SAC, ¶ 92, Ex. 2, 4, 15.) Defendant served a Notice of Entry on
August 4, 2023, to determine if the Plaintiffs were using the garage for
storage, but the notice failed to provide 24-hours’ notice and Defendant
Mauricio trespassed on the Plaintiffs’ property by entering the garage and
instructing a locksmith to saw off Plaintiffs’ padlock and destroying the
padlock despite Defendant Mauricio having a key to the padlock. (SAC, ¶¶ 94 –
104, Ex. 16.)
 
Despite the Subject Property
being a single-family home, Defendant Mauricio tried to create improper unit
designations by trespassing and tagging on the doors the number “1” and “2” to
establish the Subject Property as an apartment complex with non-existent
“common areas” that would allow Defendant Mauricio to trespass on the property.
(SAC, ¶¶ 15, 85-88.) Plaintiffs assert that only the City Engineer has the
authority to assign and modify addresses, despite Defendant Mauricio’s
attempts. (SAC, ¶ 83.) 
 
To state a claim for punitive
damages under Civ. Code § 3294, a plaintiff must allege specific facts showing
that the defendant has been guilty of malice, oppression, or fraud. (Smith
v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal. App. 4th 1033, 1042.)¿ The basis for
punitive damages must be pled with specificity; conclusory allegations devoid
of any factual assertions are insufficient. (Ibid.)¿¿“Malice” is defined
in Civ. Code § 3294 (c)(1) as “conduct which is intended by the defendant to
cause injury” or “despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with
a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” “Oppression”
is “despicable conduct subjecting a person to cruel and unjust hardship in
conscious disregard of that person’s rights.” (Civ. Code § 3294(c)(2).) The
term “despicable” has been defined in the case law as actions that are “base,”
“vile,” or “contemptible.”  (Shade Foods, Inc. v. Innovative Products
Sales & Marketing, Inc. (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 847, 891.) 
 
“In passing on the correctness
of a ruling on a motion to strike, judges read allegations of a pleading
subject to a motion to strike as a whole, all parts in their context, and
assume their truth.” (Clauson v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th
1253, 1255.) Taking the allegation in the SAC as true, the court finds that the
Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to show malice or oppression in
Defendant Mauricio’s actions in seeking to harass and illegally evict the
Plaintiffs from the Subject Property by filing meritless UD actions, abusing
the Notices of Entry, and interfering with Plaintiffs right of possession and
quiet enjoyment.
 
Therefore, the motion to strike
is denied in its entirety. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants’ Motion to Strike is
denied in its entirety. Defendants must file an Answer by August 19, 2024.  An OSC Re: Filing of Answers is set for September
4, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  The Case
Management Conference is continued to that same date and time. Defendants to
give notice.
