The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The demurrer is overruled in its entirety, meaning that the defendants cannot challenge the sufficiency of the plaintiffs' claims. The motion to strike is also denied, meaning that the defendants cannot remove certain allegations from the plaintiffs' complaint. The defendants are ordered to file an answer to the complaint by August 19, 2024, and a hearing on the filing of the answer is scheduled for August 28, 2024.
