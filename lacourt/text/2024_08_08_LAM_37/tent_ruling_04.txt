Background
 
This action arises out of the representation of Joseph L.
Shalant (“Plaintiff”) by David H. Pierce (“Defendant”) in the appeal of the
underlying case of Joseph Shalant v. Robert Mackston, LASC SC116968 (the
“Underlying Action”) in March 2020. The Underlying Action was filed on
May 8, 2012, and proceeded to a jury trial on October 29, 2019. Mr. Shalant
represented himself in pro per at trial. The jury awarded no damages to
Plaintiff, the verdict was entered on November 11, 2019, and Judgment was filed
on February 27, 2020.¿¿ 
 
Mr. Shalant chose to file a notice of appeal. When the
Court of Appeal denied his request for a prefiling order due to his vexatious
litigant status, he sought appellate counsel and found Mr. Pierce through Legal
Match. Although there is disagreement as to what Plaintiff told Defendant about
his vexatious litigant status, the parties agreed that Defendant would
represent Plaintiff. The Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) alleges “defendant
‘scrutinized plaintiff’s materials and explicitly occurred that plaintiff’s
proposed appeal was meritorious . . . and agreed to represent plaintiff….”
(SAC, ¶ 12.) The parties’ retainer agreement listed the task to be performed by
plaintiff, including research and writing a draft of Appellant’s Opening Brief.
(SAC, ¶ 4.) Defendant would then finalize the brief, making whatever changes he
deemed necessary, and then sign and file it as his own document. (Id.) 
 
On May 9, 2020, Defendant provided Plaintiff with a fee
agreement and Plaintiff paid a $2,500 deposit. Defendant filed a notice of
appeal in the Underlying Action (8305061) on March 16, 2020. (SAC, ¶ 7.) On
March 31, 2020, Defendant advised the Los Angeles Superior Court that he “is
not representing appellant on the appeal in this matter.” (SAC, ¶ 10.) On April
1, 2020, Defendant advised the Court of Appeal that he “is not representing
appellant on appeal in this matter.” (Id.) After much discussion, the parties
reached a stipulated agreement whereby the filed a Substitution of Attorney in
the appellate action on April 6, 2020, and Defendant returned the $2,500
deposit. Plaintiff never engaged new counsel for his appeal.  
 
The Court of Appeal advised the parties on December 2,
2021, that based on Plaintiff’s status as a vexatious litigant, the court was
inclined to dismiss the appeal. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on
January 11, 2022.¿¿ 
 
On March 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”). The FAC alleges the same two causes of asserted in
his original Complaint: r (1) fraud and (2) professional malpractice (legal
malpractice) against Defendant Pierce.¿¿On May 23, 2023, the court sustained
Defendant’s demurrer to the FAC with leave to amend. On June 9, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) alleging two causes of action: (1)
Breach of Fiduciary Duties and Fraud and (2) Breach of Contract and Legal
Fraud.¿¿¿ 
¿ 
On June 28, 2023, Defendant Pierce filed a demurrer with a
motion to strike the SAC. On August 29, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer
in its entirety without leave to amend and dismissed the case with
prejudice.  
 
On September 8, 2023, Plaintiff moved for reconsideration
of the court’s August 29, 2023, ruling. The court denied the motion on November
6, 2023. On November 21, 2023, Plaintiff brought another motion for
re-reconsideration. On January 19, 2024, the court denied the motion for
re-reconsideration.  
 
Defendant Pierce now moves for attorney’s fees based on the
vexatious litigant statute. Plaintiff opposes the Motion. The court allowed
supplemental briefing. The matter is now before the court.  
 
motion for
attorney fees
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
A prevailing party is entitled to recover costs, including
attorneys’ fees, as a matter of right.¿ (CCP §§ 1032(a)(4), 1032(b), 1033.5.)¿Attorney’s
fees may be recovered as costs when authorized by contract, statute, or law.
(CCP, § 1033.5(a)(10).)¿The prevailing party on a contract, which specifically
provides for attorney fees and costs incurred to enforce the agreement, is
entitled to reasonable attorney fees in addition to other costs.¿ (Civ. Code §
1717(a); CCP, §§ 1032, 1033.5(a)(10)(A).)¿ The court, upon notice and motion by
a party, shall determine the prevailing party and shall fix, as an element of
the costs of the suit, the reasonable attorney fees.¿ (Civ. Code § 1717(a),
(b).)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
“It is well established that the determination of what
constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the discretion of the
trial court, whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence of an abuse of
discretion.”¿ (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623-624.)¿The
fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily “begins with the ‘lodestar’
[method], i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate.”¿(Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)¿ 
 
II.        Discussion
 
Pursuant to CCP § 391.1, the Court declared Plaintiff a
vexatious litigant and ordered him to furnish a security in the sum of
$7,555.00. (Order of 3/1/2023.) In its March 1, 2023 Order, the court stated: 
 
The
court agrees that Defendant is not entitled to security that includes attorney
fees, and thus orders Plaintiff to post security only for Defendant’s
“reasonable expenses.”
 
(Order of 3/1/2023.)
 
“[I]t follows that section 996.460, when
read in conjunction with sections 391, subdivision (c), 391.1 and 391.3,
authorizes an award of attorney fees in favor of a defendant from the security
posted by the unsuccessful vexatious litigant without requiring an
additional statutory or contractual basis for the award.” (Singh v. Lipworth (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 40, 47
(Singh) [italics added].) 
 
CCP
§ 996.460(a) states: 
 
(a) Notwithstanding
Section 2845 of the Civil Code, a judgment of liability on a bond shall be in
favor of the beneficiary and against the principal and sureties and shall
obligate each of them jointly and severally.
 
CCP § 391(c) defines “security”
as follows: 
 
(c) “Security” means an undertaking to assure
payment, to the party for whose benefit the undertaking is required to be
furnished, of the party's reasonable expenses, including
attorney's fees and not limited to taxable costs, incurred in or in connection
with a litigation instituted, caused to be instituted, or maintained or caused
to be maintained by a vexatious litigant.
 
CCP § 391.1(a) states: 
(a) In any litigation pending in any court of this
state, at any time until final judgment is entered, a defendant may move the
court, upon notice and hearing, for an order requiring the plaintiff to furnish
security or for an order dismissing the litigation pursuant to subdivision (b)
of Section 391.3. The motion for an order requiring the plaintiff to furnish
security shall be based upon the ground, and supported by a showing, that the
plaintiff is a vexatious litigant and that there is not a reasonable probability
that they will prevail in the litigation against the moving defendant.


CCP § 391.3 states:
 
(a)
Except as provided in subdivision (b), if, after hearing the evidence upon the
motion, the court determines that the plaintiff is a vexatious litigant and
that there is no reasonable probability that the plaintiff will prevail in the
litigation against the moving defendant, the court shall order the plaintiff to
furnish, for the benefit of the moving defendant, security in such amount and
within such time as the court shall fix.
 
(b)
If, after hearing evidence on the motion, the court determines that the
litigation has no merit and has been filed for the purposes of harassment or
delay, the court shall order the litigation dismissed. This subdivision shall
only apply to litigation filed in a court of this state by a vexatious litigant
subject to a prefiling order pursuant to Section 391.7 who was represented by
counsel at the time the litigation was filed and who became in propria persona
after the withdrawal of his or her attorney.
 
(c) A
defendant may make a motion for relief in the alternative under either
subdivision (a) or (b) and shall combine all grounds for relief in one motion.
 
As explained in Singh,
the purpose of the security is to “‘assure payment of the secured party's “reasonable
expenses, including attorney's fees and not limited to taxable costs, ...’
[citations], and that ‘[u]pon the termination of the litigation the defendant
shall have recourse to the security in such
amount as the court shall determine’ [citation].” (Singh, supra,
132 Cal.App.4th at p. 46.) “[T]he vexatious litigant statute, both by its terms
and history, provides an independent statutory basis for awarding attorney fees
to a defendant in an action prosecuted by a vexatious litigant, and as such
supports the court's decision to require security from plaintiff.” (Id.
at p. 47.) 
 
Moreover, it was not in error for the
court to decline to award attorney’s fees when at the time the Defendant moved
for Plaintiff to furnish a security, it was not foreseeable that Defendant
would incur attorney’s fees for representing himself.  In Muller v. Tanner
(1969) 2 Cal.App.3d 445, the plaintiff as a vexatious litigant asserted “that
if defendant is permitted to appear personally he should not be allowed, and
ergo, should not be allowed security for, attorney's
fees which are not actually incurred.” (Id. at p. 465.) The Muller Court noted that the full
cost of litigation would not be ascertainable until completion of the action
and “[i]t is more appropriate to then determine whether or
not the court should recognize that a lawyer's time is his stock in trade. Meanwhile,
it is no injustice to the vexatious litigant to have him give security for what
at the time of hearing appears to be necessary to assure payment of the reasonable expenses
contemplated by the statute.” (Id. at p. 466.) 
 
Pursuant to Singh, Defendant must look
to the security for the recovery of any attorney’s fees or expenses. “ ‘[U]pon the termination of the litigation
the defendant shall have recourse to the security in such
amount as the court shall determine’ [citation].” (Singh, supra,
132 Cal.App.4th at p. 46.) “According to the Singh court, the liability and the
remedy were created by the vexatious litigant statutes, which authorized an
attorney's fees award in favor of a successful defendant from the security posted by a vexatious litigant. [Citation.]”
(Luckett v. Keylee (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 919, 924–925
[italics added].)
 
Defendant fails to cite any legal
authority that would permit the court to award attorney’s fees in excess or in
addition to the amount posted in the security furnished by Plaintiff. 
At the commencement of this action, the
Defendant was self-represented and not entitled to attorney’s fees. (CCP § 1021
[“Except as attorney's fees are specifically provided for by statute, the
measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to
the agreement, express or implied, of the parties; but parties to actions or
proceedings are entitled to their
costs, as hereinafter provided.”]; see also Trope v. Katz (1995)
11 Cal.4th 274, 282.) 
 
Defendant’s billing records reflect that
it was not until August 15, 2023, that Defendant retained counsel from his firm
to represent him in this matter. (Supp. Pierce Decl. Ex. A.) This occurred
after Plaintiff had already furnished a security for Defendant’s reasonable
expenses. Defendant’s initial motion requested $19,858.32 for attorney’s fees
and costs composed of $19,125.00 and $733.32 in costs. (Motion, at p. 5:13-15;
Hidalgo Decl. ¶ 3.) Defendant now requests attorney’s fees in the sum of
$24,000.00. (Supp. Pierce Decl. ¶ 10.) 
 
Attorney’s fees may be recovered as costs when authorized
by contract, statute, or law. (CCP § 1033.5(a)(10).) The party
claiming attorneys’ fees must establish entitlement to such fees and the
reasonableness of the fees claimed. (Civic Western Corporation v.
Zila Industries, Inc. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 1, 16.) Apart from the vexatious
litigant statute, Defendant fails to point to any other statute or furnish a
contract that would permit Defendant to recover attorney’s fees. (See CCP §
1717.) Moreover, as explained above, the vexatious litigant statute only
permits recovery from the security furnished by the Plaintiff. 
 
“[T]he
Legislature intended
section 391, subdivision (c) to be construed expansively” and because section
391(c) permits the recovery of attorney’s fees to be paid from the security,
the court awards Defendant $7,555.00 for Defendants “reasonable expenses,
including attorney's fees[.]” (Singh, supra, 132 Cal.App.4th at
p. 45; CCP, § 391(c).) 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant’s request for
attorney’s fees and expenses is granted and limited to the security furnished
by Plaintiff in the of $7,555.00. Defendant to give notice.
