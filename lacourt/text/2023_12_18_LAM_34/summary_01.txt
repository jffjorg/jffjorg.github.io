Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting in part the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions and monetary sanctions. The defendant, Martin Luther King Jr. Healthcare Corporation, had filed the motion after the plaintiff, Fatimah Muhammad, failed to comply with discovery orders. The judge found that the plaintiff had not served discovery responses and had not responded to the defendant's discovery requests, despite being ordered to do so. As a result, the judge granted the motion and dismissed the defendant with prejudice from the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The judge also denied the request for monetary sanctions, citing the plaintiff's lack of resources. The remaining motions filed by the defendant, including motions to compel responses and a motion for summary judgment, were taken off calendar. The case has been dismissed.
