 Case Number:  23PSCV01493    Hearing Date:   October 16, 2023    Dept:  6 Plaintiff
Amur Equipment Finance, Inc.’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment 
Defendant: Daniel Ferrer Hernandez, an Individual dba DFH Services 
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff’s request for entry of default
judgment is DENIED without prejudice. 
BACKGROUND
This is a collection action. On May 17, 2023, Plaintiff Amur
Equipment Finance, Inc. (Plaintiff) filed this action against Defendant Daniel
Ferrer Hernandez, an Individual dba DFH Services (Defendant) and Does 1 through
100, alleging causes of action for breach of written agreement, open book
account, and account stated. Default was entered against Defendant on September
5, 2023. Plaintiff filed a default judgment package on September 8, 2023.
LEGAL
STANDARD
Code of Civil Procedure section 585
permits entry of a default judgment after a party has failed to timely respond
or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party seeking judgment on the default by
the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of
the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the
judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of
costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of
all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.)  
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff seeks default judgment against
Defendants in the total amount of $50,619.13, including $42,816.64 in damages, $5,616.60
in interest, $1,647.49 in attorney’s fees, and $511.40 in costs. The Court
finds the default judgment package has multiple issues that need to be
addressed. First, the contract at issue is governed by the laws of the State of
Nebraska. (Compl., Ex. 1, ¶ 17.) This potentially affects calculations with
respect to prejudgment interest, attorney’s fees, and costs. For example, for
Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim, Plaintiff seeks 18% interest from the
date of breach, but the standard rate for prejudgment interest in contract
cases in California is 10%. (Code Civ. Proc., § 3289, subd. (b); see also Id.,
§ 1033.5 [list of recoverable costs].) Plaintiff also alleges entitlement to
attorney’s fees under Civil Code section 1717.5, which is California law.
(Compl., ¶ 17.) 
Second, other problems include the Code
of Civil Procedure section 585, subdivision (d) declaration submitted by
Plaintiff. It is unclear how the declarant, Karen Beran, purportedly has
personal knowledge of the facts supporting the request for entry of default
judgment. Ms. Beran’s declaration only provides that she is a paralegal, but it
does not provide for whom she is a paralegal. (Beran Decl., ¶ 1.) Without any
further clarity on this point, it is unclear if Ms. Beran is a paralegal for
Plaintiff directly or for Plaintiff’s counsel, the latter of which would be
particularly problematic in terms of personal knowledge and foundation. (Evid.
Code § 702.) 
Third, Civil
Code section 1717.5, subdivisions (a) and (b) provide that: 
“(a)… Reasonable attorney's fees awarded
pursuant to this section for the prevailing party bringing the action on the
book account shall be fixed by the court in an amount that shall not exceed the
lesser of: (1) nine hundred sixty
dollars ($960) for book accounts based upon an
obligation owing by a natural person for goods, moneys, or services which were
primarily for personal, family, or household purposes; and one thousand two hundred dollars ($1,200) for all other book accounts to
which this section applies; or (2) 25 percent of the principal obligation owing
under the contract. 
(b) The attorney's fees allowed pursuant to
this section shall be the lesser of either the maximum amount allowed by this
section, the amount provided by any default attorney's fee schedule adopted by
the court applicable to the suit, or an amount as otherwise provided by the
court. Any claim for attorney's fees pursuant to this section in excess of the
amounts set forth in the default attorney's fee schedule shall be reasonable
attorney's fees, as proved by the party, as actual and necessary for the claim that
is subject to this section.” 
(Civ. Code § 1717.5, subd. (b).) 
The amount Plaintiff has requested,
$1,647.49, exceeds the $1,200.00 limit provided under Civil Code section
1717.5, subdivision (a). Plaintiff has not provided any calculation showing how
this number was determined, nor any other evidence justifying the request for
$1,647.49. Plaintiff also has not shown what the per diem interest rate is for
the requested prejudgment interest. (Beran Decl., ¶ 16.) 
Fourth, this action involves a written
obligation to pay money, but Plaintiff has not provided a declaration in lieu
of the original written agreement per Rule 3.1806 of the California Rules of
Court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1806; Kahn v. Lasorda's Dugout, Inc.
(2003) 109 CA4th 1118, 1122.) 
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
