  Case Number:  21PSCV00515    Hearing Date:   October 16, 2023    Dept:  6 CASE NAME:   Amin  David Chacon v. Ford Motor Company Defendant  Ford Motor Company’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint  TENTATIVE  RULING The Court OVERRULES the demurrer to the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth causes  of action.  Defendant is ordered to file an answer to the FAC within 10 days  of the date of this order.  BACKGROUND This is a lemon law case. On June  21, 2021, Plaintiff Amin David Chacon (Plaintiff) filed this action against  Defendant Ford Motor Company (Defendant) and Does 1 through 50. On June 26,  2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint (FAC), alleging  causes of action for violation of subdivision (d) of Civil Code section 1793.2,  violation of subdivision (b) of Civil Code section 1793.2, subdivision (a)(3)  of Civil Code section 1793.2, breach of express written warranty, breach of the  implied warranty of merchantability, violations of the Consumer Legal Remedies  Act (CLRA), violations of the Unfair Competition Law (UCL), and fraud by  omission.  On August 4, 2023, Defendant filed  the instant demurrer. On October 2, 2023, Plaintiff opposed. On October 9,  2023, Defendant replied.  LEGAL  STANDARD A demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of  other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or  content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or  cross-complaint). (Code Civ.  Proc., § 422.10; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116  Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) It is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the  truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of ruling on the demurrer, all  facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true. (Id.)    A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on  the face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading  that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,  318; Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) No other  extrinsic evidence can be considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson  (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in  memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso  v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal  v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider  contents of release not part of court record].)    A demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint”  itself is incomplete or discloses some defense that would bar recovery. (Guardian  North Bay, Inc. v. Superior Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.) The  “face of the complaint” includes material contained in attached exhibits that  are incorporated by reference into the complaint; or in a superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v.  Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v. Fireman’s  Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as  surplusage the pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the  exhibits.”]).    A demurrer can only be sustained when it disposes of an entire  cause of action. (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148  Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev.  Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028,  1046.)   REQUEST  FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE             The Court DENIES Defendant’s request  for judicial notice as to Exhibit 1. Defendant has not provided  sufficient information to demonstrate that the proffered copy of the Retail  Installment Sales Contract is not reasonably subject to dispute and is  "capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of  reasonably indisputable accuracy." (Evid. Code § 452, subd. (h).) The  case law cited by Defendant in support of the request for judicial notice are  both federal cases which are not binding on this Court, (see People v.  Beltran (2013) 56 Cal.App.4th 935, 953, internal citations omitted), and  also rely upon the Federal Rules of Evidence, which do not apply in this case. Also,  the quotation Defendant attributed to Knievel v. ESPN (9th Cir. 2005)  393 F.3d 1068 is nowhere to be found in that case, nor is there any discussion  of requests for judicial notice by the majority opinion therein. (See generally  Id.) Even if the Court were to grant judicial notice, it would only be  as to the “the existence, content and authenticity of public records and  other specified documents”; it would not be as to the truthfulness of the factual  matters asserted in those documents. (Dominguez v. Bonta  (2022) 87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.)     The  Court GRANTS Defendant’s request for judicial notice as to Exhibit 4. (Evid.  Code § 452, subd. (a).)  MEET AND CONFER Per Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41,  subdivision (a), the parties were required to meet and confer in person or by  telephone before bringing this demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.  (a).) The Court finds the parties’ efforts to meet and confer sufficient.  DISCUSSION             Sixth  Cause of Action – Violations of the CLRA A cause of action under the CLRA “must be stated with reasonable  particularity, which is a more lenient pleading standard than is applied to  common law fraud claims.” (Gutierrez v. Carmax Auto Superstore California  (2018) 19 Cal.App.5th 1234, 1261.) The CLRA protects individuals engaging in  consumer transactions. It prohibits “unfair methods of competition and  unfair or deceptive acts or practices undertaken by any person in a transaction  intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of goods or services  to any consumer.” (Civ. Code, § 1770, subd.  (a).) It sets forth twenty-seven (27) different “unfair or deceptive acts or  practices” that may constitute a violation of the CLRA. (Ibid.) In  assessing whether the representations made in the course of the consumer  transaction violate the CLRA, courts use the reasonable consumer standard—i.e.,  whether a reasonable consumer would be misled by the representation. (Consumer  Advocates v. Echostar Satellite Corp. (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 1351,  1360.) To the extent an alleged violation is based on the defendant’s  omission of a material fact, “to be actionable the omission must be contrary to  a representation actually made by the defendant, or an omission of a fact the  defendant was obliged to disclose.” (Daugherty v. American Honda Motor  Co., Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 824, 835.)  Defendant demurs to the Sixth cause of action on the grounds that  it fails to state sufficient facts alleging a failure to provide sufficient  service literature and replacement parts. The Court disagrees.  The Court finds that the majority of Defendant’s demurrer to the  Sixth cause of action focuses on disputed facts rather than addressing the  allegations, the latter of which the Court assumes the truth of on a demurrer.  (Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) The Court does not  resolve disputed facts on a demurrer. (Panterra GP, Inc. v. Superior  Court of Kern County (2022) 74 Cal. App. 5th 697, 709.) Defendant’s moving papers also  say very little about Plaintiff purportedly failing to allege sufficient facts  regarding service literature and replacement parts.  The  Court finds the FAC alleges sufficient facts to demonstrate that a reasonable  consumer would have been misled here. (See Consumer  Advocates, supra, 113 Cal.App.4th at p. 1360.) Plaintiff alleges  that the subject vehicle had an engine defect involving excess consumption of  oil, (FAC, ¶¶ 18-54), that this alleged defect was unreasonably dangerous  because it could cause the engine to stall at any time during operation of the  subject vehicle, (FAC, ¶ 26), that Defendant had a duty to disclose this  information because Defendant knew of this information before Plaintiff  purchased the subject vehicle, (FAC, ¶¶ 35-54), and that Defendant actively  concealed and failed to disclose this information when the subject vehicle was  sold to Plaintiff, (FAC, ¶¶ 102-110). Plaintiff also alleges that the technical  service bulletins were only disclosed to dealerships; the FAC says nothing of  their being disclosed to the public. (FAC, ¶¶ 35-36.) Even if they had been  disclosed, Plaintiff alleges that the language in the technical service  bulletins is written in a language not easily understood by lay persons. (FAC,  ¶ 36.)  Moreover,  Plaintiff can state a claim under the CLRA without having entered into a  consumer transaction directly with Defendant. Plaintiff alleges that he  purchased the subject vehicle manufactured by Defendant with an express written  warranty by Defendant. (FAC, ¶¶ 6, 10.) As set forth above, Plaintiff alleges  that Defendant knowingly and intentionally concealed known defects from  Plaintiff and that such failures to disclose caused Plaintiff damage. (FAC, ¶¶  18-54, 102-111.) This is sufficient to plead a "transaction" against Defendant.  “[A] cause of action under the CLRA may be established independent of any  contractual relationship between the parties," such as a claim against a  manufacturer of a product, even where purchasers may not have bought the  product from manufacturer but through independent distributors. (McAdams v.  Monier, Inc. (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 174, 186 [citing Chamberlan v. Ford  Motor Co. (N.D. Cal. 2005) 369 F.Supp.2d 1138, 1144].)  Furthermore,  Defendant’s reliance upon the case of Durkee v. Ford Motor Company (N.D.  Cal. 2014) 2014 WL 4352184 is unavailing because it is an unpublished federal  district court opinion, and therefore is not binding upon this Court. (Aguirre  v. Amscan Holdings, Inc. (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 1290, 1298 fn. 5.)[1] It is also factually distinguishable since the plaintiff in Durkee had  only requested injunctive relief under the CLRA. (Durkee, supra, 2014 WL  4352184 at p. 3). Here, Plaintiff is requesting all available relief under the  CLRA. (FAC, ¶ 112).  Based  on the foregoing, the Court OVERRULES the demurrer to the Sixth cause of action.  Seventh  Cause of Action – Unfair Competition Law California Business and Professions Code section 17200 prohibits  “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.” (Bus. &  Prof. Code § 17200; see Clark v. Superior Court (2010) 50 Cal.4th 605,  610.) “An unlawful business practice or act is an act or  practice, committed pursuant to business activity, that is at the same time  forbidden by law.” (Klein v. Earth Elements, Inc. (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th  965, 969.) As for  fraud, to establish a fraudulent practice under the UCL, the plaintiff must  show that members of the public are likely to be deceived. (See West v.  JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 806.) Lastly, “[a] business practice  is unfair within the meaning of the UCL if it violates established public  policy or if it is immoral, unethical, oppressive or unscrupulous and causes  injury to consumers which outweighs its benefits.” (McKell v. Washington  Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1473.)  Defendant demurs to the Seventh cause of action on the grounds  that it fails to state sufficient facts alleging a failure to provide  sufficient service literature and replacement parts. Defendant otherwise argues  that Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to state a UCL cause of  action. The Court disagrees.  The  Court finds much of Defendant’s arguments here to be conclusory and still  otherwise fail to address the purported issues with respect to service  literature and replacement parts. As noted above, the FAC alleges facts  demonstrating that Defendant was aware of engine defects in connection with the  subject vehicle and that Defendant concealed and failed to disclose those  defects when Plaintiff purchased the subject vehicle. (FAC, ¶¶ 18-54.) The  Court finds Defendant’s arguments that the FAC lacks sufficient allegations to  put Defendant on notice to be disingenuous. Plaintiff has provided extensive  allegations regarding the engine defects at issue and Defendant’s failure to  disclose those defects before Plaintiff purchased the subject vehicle. (Id.)  Moreover,  since the Court found that Plaintiff alleged sufficient facts to state a cause  of action under the CLRA, Plaintiff has also then alleged sufficient facts to  state a cause of action under the UCL (FAC, ¶ 115) since the UCL is often  predicated on other violations of law. “By  proscribing ‘any unlawful’ business practice, ‘[Business and Professions Code]  section 17200 ‘borrows’ violations of other laws and treats them as unlawful  practices’ that the unfair competition law makes independently actionable.  [Citation.] ‘Thus, a violation of another law is a predicate for stating a  cause of action under the UCL's unlawful prong.’ [Citation.]” (Rubenstein v. The Gap, Inc. (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 870,  879–880.)              Based  on the foregoing, the Court OVERRULES the demurrer to the Seventh cause of action.              Eighth Cause of Action –  Fraud by Omission For fraudulent concealment,  the plaintiff must allege facts demonstrating “’(1) concealment or suppression  of a material fact; (2) by a defendant with a duty to disclose the fact to the  plaintiff; (3) the defendant intended to defraud the plaintiff by intentionally  concealing or suppressing the fact; (4) the plaintiff was unaware of the fact  and would not have acted as he or she did if he or she had known of the  concealed or suppressed fact; and (5) plaintiff sustained damage as a result of  the concealment or suppression of the fact. [Citation.]’” (Daneshmand v. City of San Juan Capistrano (2021) 60  Cal.App.5th 923, 931–932, internal citations omitted). “There are ‘four  circumstances in which nondisclosure or concealment may constitute actionable  fraud: (1) when the defendant is in a fiduciary relationship with the  plaintiff; (2) when the defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not  known to the plaintiff; (3) when the defendant actively conceals a material  fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when the defendant makes partial  representations but also suppresses some material facts. [Citation.]’  [Citation.]” (LiMandri v. Judkins (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 326, 336.)  “’In transactions which  do not involve fiduciary or confidential relations, a cause of action for  non-disclosure of material facts may arise in at least three instances: (1) the  defendant makes representations but does not disclose facts which materially  qualify the facts disclosed, or which render his disclosure likely to mislead;  (2) the facts are known or accessible only to defendant, and defendant knows  they are not known to or reasonably discoverable by the plaintiff; (3) the  defendant actively conceals discovery from the plaintiff.’ (Warner Construction Corp. v.  City of Los Angeles (1970) 2 Cal.3d 285, 294, 85 Cal.Rptr. 444, 466  P.2d 996, italics added, fns. omitted.) Other cases have described the  requisite relationship with the same term. (See, e.g., Hoffman v. 162 North Wolfe LLC  (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 1178, 1187, 175 Cal.Rptr.3d 820 (Hoffman); LiMandri, supra, 52  Cal.App.4th at p. 337, 60 Cal.Rptr.2d 539 [‘As a matter of common sense, such a  relationship can only come into being as a result of some sort of transaction between  the parties.’].)  Defendant demurs to the  Eighth cause of action on the grounds that it fails to allege sufficient facts  to state a cause of action for fraud. More specifically, Defendant contends  there is no transactional relationship between Plaintiff and Defendant, the FAC  lacks the requisite specificity necessary for a fraud claim, and the economic  loss rule bars Plaintiff’s fraudulent concealment claim. The Court disagrees.  An actionable claim for fraud  based on non-disclosure can be stated where the facts are known or accessible  only to defendant, and defendant knows they are not known to or reasonably  discoverable by the plaintiff. (Warner Construction Corp., supra, 2 Cal.3d at p. 294.  The FAC alleges that Defendant committed fraud by failing to disclose to  Plaintiff that the engine was defective, (FAC, ¶ 123), that Defendant knew the  engine was inherently defective prior to the purchase (FAC, ¶ 124), that Defendant  acquired knowledge of the engine defect through sources not available to  consumers such as Plaintiff (FAC, ¶ 125.a.), that Defendant was in a superior  position from various internal sources to know about the defects (FAC, ¶ 125.b),  and that Plaintiff could not reasonably have been expected to learn of or  discover the engine defects before purchasing the vehicle (FAC, ¶ 125.c.) These  allegations, taken as true, are sufficient to establish a duty to disclose and  an actionable claim for fraud by non-disclosure. The FAC also alleges extensive specific allegations regarding the engine defects  at issue and Defendant’s failure to disclose those defects before Plaintiff  purchased the subject vehicle.  Finally, Defendant argues  that the Eighth cause of action for fraud by omission is barred by the economic  loss rule. The economic loss rule posits that a purchaser of a product that  does not live up to the buyer's expectations can only recover in contract and  not tort, "unless [the purchaser] can demonstrate harm above and beyond a  broken contractual promise." (Robinson Helicopter Company, Inc. v. Dana  Corporation (2004) 34 Cal.4th 979, 988.) A tort claim for fraud must be  sufficiently independent from a breach of contract claim for which the  plaintiff suffered economic loss. (Id. at p. 991.) Thus, in order to  plead around the economic loss rule, a party must plead the existence of a duty  that arises independent of any contractual duty and independent injury, other  than economic loss, that arises from the breach of that duty. (Robinson,  supra, 34 Cal.4th at 988-91.)  In Robinson, the  California Supreme Court carved out an exception to the economic loss rule,  holding that claims for fraud and intentional misrepresentations, which are  independent of the contract alleged to have been breached, are not barred by  the economic loss rule.. (Robinson, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 991.) In Dhital  v. Nissan North America, Inc. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 828, 838, the Court held  that claims for fraudulent inducement by concealment are not barred by the economic  loss rule. Here, this Court concludes that Plaintiff’s' claim for fraudulent omission  is also not barred by the economic loss rule because the fraudulent exception applies.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant,  by intentionally concealing facts about the defective transmission,  fraudulently induced him to purchase the subject vehicle. (FAC, ¶¶ 53,  127-129.) Plaintiff alleges that a reasonable person would have considered the  engine defect important in deciding whether to purchase the vehicle and that had  Plaintiff known that the vehicle had the engine defect, he would not have  purchased the vehicle. (FAC, ¶¶ 127, 129.) These allegations are sufficient to  show that the economic loss rule does not bar the claim for fraudulent omission.  Based on the foregoing, the  Court OVERRULES the demurrer to the Eighth Cause of Action.  CONCLUSION The Court OVERRULES the demurrer to the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth causes  of action.  Defendant is ordered to file an answer to the FAC within 10 days of the date of this order.
