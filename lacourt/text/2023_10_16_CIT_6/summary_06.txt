And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff, Amur Equipment Finance, Inc., seeks a default judgment against the defendant, Daniel Ferrer Hernandez, in the amount of $50,619.13. However, the court finds that the default judgment package has several issues that need to be addressed. The contract at issue is governed by the laws of the State of Nebraska, which may affect calculations for prejudgment interest, attorney's fees, and costs. The court also finds that the declarant, Karen Beran, may not have personal knowledge of the facts supporting the request for entry of default judgment. Additionally, the court notes that the plaintiff's request for attorney's fees exceeds the statutory limit and lacks supporting evidence. Finally, the court notes that the plaintiff has not provided a declaration in lieu of the original written agreement, as required by California law. Based on these issues, the court denies the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice.
