And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the motions to set aside the default judgments against the defendants (Markarian, RRRM Holding Company, LLC, Ohanjanyan, and Arutunyan) are granted. The defendants had filed a demurrer to the complaint, but it was not filed with the court, and the default was entered against them despite their belief that they had filed a responsive pleading. The judge found that the default was entered as a result of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, and that the defendants acted in good faith, believing that they had filed a responsive pleading. The judge also noted that the policy of the law strongly favors a hearing on the merits, which supports granting the motions. As a result, the defendants are ordered to file a responsive pleading following the hearing on this matter.
