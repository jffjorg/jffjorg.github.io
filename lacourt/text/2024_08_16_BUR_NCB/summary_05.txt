And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Mariam Avanessian's motion for trial preference. The motion was filed on July 12, 2024, and the court had previously granted the defendants' motion to compel arbitration on May 8, 2024. The court stayed the action pending the resolution of the arbitration, and Plaintiff has not requested a lift from the stay to consider the motion on its merits. The court notes that the Plaintiff is only seeking damages for injuries occurring on and after October 31, 2023, and that the parties should meet and confer regarding whether the arbitration is necessary and stipulate to whether Plaintiff will be pursuing any claims for damages prior to October 31, 2023. The court orders that the action is currently stayed pending the resolution of the arbitration, and Plaintiff may move for trial preference following the conclusion of the arbitration proceedings.
