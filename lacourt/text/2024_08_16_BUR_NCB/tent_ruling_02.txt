Trial
  Date:  August 16, 2024
 
 [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
Motion for statutory attorney’s fees  
 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations
Plaintiff Tommy Sabre Buttner
(“Plaintiff”) alleges that this matter involves the deceptive sale of a used,
unsafe, defective vehicle that was sold to Plaintiff by Defendant/dealer
Alternative Automotive Solutions, LLC (“Defendant”).  Plaintiff alleges that the vehicle was stolen
with a different VIN number so that when Plaintiff reported the issue to the
California Highway Patrol, the vehicle was taken away from Plaintiff,
impounded, and returned to the original owner even though Plaintiff had paid
the dealership in full and had no involvement in the illegal actions of
Defendant. 
The complaint, filed May 22, 2023, alleges
causes of action for: (1) violations of Consumers Legal Remedies Act (Civ.
Code, § 1750 et seq.); (2) conversion; (3) violations of Unfair
Competition Law (Bus. & Profs. Code, § 17200 et seq.); and (4) bond
liability. 
B.    
Relevant Background
This case proceeded to trial before the
Court on April 2, 2024.
The Court issued a Statement of Decision
on April 5, 2024.  The Court dismissed
the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th causes of action based
on Plaintiff’s failure to proceed at trial. 
The Court stated that Plaintiff would have judgment against Defendant in
the amount of $28,095 on the 1st cause of action.  
The Court entered Judgment on April 22,
2024.  The Judgment states that judgment
was entered in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of
$28,095.  Plaintiff may seek costs by
Memorandum of Costs and may seek statutory attorney’s fees by noticed
motion.  
C.    
Motion on Calendar 
On May 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion
for statutory attorney’s fees.
On August 5, 2024, Defendant filed an
opposition brief.
On August 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply
brief.  
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff moves for attorney’s fees and costs after trial in the amount of
$21,705.  
A.   
Entitlement to Attorney’s Fees
Plaintiff moves
for attorney’s fees on the grounds that he was successful in bringing his
consumer claims under the CLRA. 
Civil
Code, § 1780(e) regarding the CLRA states: “The court shall award court costs and attorney's fees to a prevailing
plaintiff in litigation filed pursuant to this section. Reasonable
attorney's fees may be awarded to a prevailing defendant upon a finding by the
court that the plaintiff's prosecution of the action was not in good faith.”   Civil Code, § 1794(d) regarding Consumer Warranty Protection states: “If the buyer prevails in an action under this section, the
buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum
equal to the aggregate amount of costs and
expenses, including attorney's fees based on actual time expended,
determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in
connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.”  
Here,
there is a statutory basis for attorney’s fees in this action.  Plaintiff is the prevailing party on the 1st
cause of action for violations of the CLRA (Civ.  Code, § 1750 et seq.), as judgment was
entered in his favor in the amount of $28,095. 
In the opposition brief, Defendant does not dispute Plaintiff’s
entitlement to fees.  Thus, as the
prevailing party, Plaintiff is entitled to fees pursuant to statute.  
B.    
Reasonableness of Attorney’s Fees 
In support of the request for attorney’s fees in the amount of $21,705,
Plaintiff provides the declaration of counsel Robert B. Mobasseri.  He states that he had a contingent fee
agreement with Plaintiff, though services were performed at an hourly
rate.  (Mobasseri Decl., ¶4.)  Mr. Mobasseri states that he is familiar with
the rates charged by similarly experienced attorneys and specialists in the
area for dealer fraud and consumer litigation, and that the hourly rates
requested are consistent with those rates. (Id., ¶11; Ex. C [recent fee
awards].)  In his declaration, counsel
summarizes the work that was performed in this action.  (Id., ¶14.)  Mr. Mobasseri states that he and his firm
incurred $21,705 in total fees, which can be broken down as follows:
·        
Mr. Mobasseri (admitted 1997, managing partner): $562.50 (0.90
hours x $625/hour)
·        
David Alan
Cooper (admitted 1997, senior
associate): $17,076.50 (28.70 hours x $595/hour)
·        
Barbara A.
Rohr (admitted 2010, former associate): $833 (1.40 hours x
$595/hour)
·        
Steven
Berkowitz (JD, paralegal): $1,272 (4.8
hours x $265/hour)
·        
James D.
Stone (paralegal): $1,961 (7.4
hours x $265/hour).  
(Mobasseri Decl., ¶¶2, 5, 8-10; Ex. A [Billing
Records].)  
            In
the opposition brief, Defendant argues that the hourly rates are grossly
inflated.  Also, while Defendant believes
that Mr. Cooper likely spent 28.7 hours on the action as requested, he argues
that 15-20 hours are more realistic for the hours spent by counsel in this case
at $200/hour ($4,000 for attorney time) and 20 hours at $40/hour for paralegal
time ($800 for paralegal time).  Defendant
argues that $4,800 is an acceptably fair amount of attorney’s fees to be
awarded in this action.  
            The Court will make the following
adjustments to the fees requested: 
·        
Mr. Mobasseri: The tasks performed by Mr. Mobasseri on April 12,
2023, May 9, 2023, and June 9, 2023 were to correspond with the client
regarding the case for a total of 0.90 hours at $625/hour.  While the time spent on corresponding with
the client was modest at 0.90 hour, the Court will reduce Mr. Mobasseri’s
hourly rate to $350/hour.  Thus, the
total amount of attorney’s fees allowable for Mr. Mobasseri’s services shall be
$315 total.
·        
David Alan
Cooper: The Court has reviewed Mr.
Cooper’s time spent in this action and finds that the tasks performed and the
time spent on each task were reasonable. 
The Court will allow the 28.70 hours requested by Mr. Cooper, but will
reduce his hourly rate to $350/hour. 
Thus, the amount of attorney’s fees allowable for Mr. Cooper’s services
shall be $10,045.
·        
Barbara A.
Rohr: The task performed by Ms. Rohr was to review and
edit the CLRA complaint (drafted by paralegal James Stone) for 1.4 hours on
March 10, 2023; she performed no other work on the case.  The Court will allow the 1.4 hours to be
billed, but will reduce her hourly rate to $300/hour.  Thus, the amount of attorney’s fees allowable
for Ms. Rohr’s services shall be $420. 
·        
Steven
Berkowitz and James D. Stone:
The work performed by the paralegals appear to have been reasonable and
necessary, and were not merely secretarial or administrative in nature.  As such, the Court will allow the 4.8 hours
incurred by Mr. Berkowitz and 7.4 hours incurred by Mr. Stone, but will reduce
their hourly rates to $100/hour.  Thus,
the total amount of fees allowable for the paralegals’ services shall be $1,220
total.
Thus, the total amount of attorney’s fees that will be
awarded in this action shall be $12,000.
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Plaintiff Tommy
Sabre Buttner’s motion for attorney’s fees is granted in the amount of $12,000.    
Plaintiff shall
provide notice of this order.
