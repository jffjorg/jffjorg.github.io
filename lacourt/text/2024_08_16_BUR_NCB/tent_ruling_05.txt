 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motion for trial
  preference  



 
BACKGROUND 
A.   
Allegations
Plaintiff Mariam Avanessian (“Plaintiff”)
alleges that she was born on July 3, 1952, such that she is 71 years old and an
“elder” pursuant to the Welfare & Institutions Code.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendants Alameda
Care Center, Artesia Healthcare, Inc. dba Alameda Care Center, and Longwood
Management, LLC were the owners, operators, and managers of Alameda Care Center
and were acting as “care custodians” during Plaintiff’s admission to Alameda
Care Center.  Plaintiff alleges that she
was totally dependent upon Defendants for food, shelter, medical treatment,
physical hygiene, and assistance with all activities of daily living, but
Defendants failed to operate and provide services in compliance with federal
and state regulations, failed to protect her from health hazards, neglected and
abused her, and failed to provide for her physical and mental health
needs.  
Plaintiff alleges that on April 27, 2022,
her son Allen received a call from the nursing staff to inform him that
Plaintiff had fallen during the night, injuring her right leg.  Plaintiff alleges that Alameda Care Center
took an x-ray and diagnosed her with a fracture of an “unspecified part of neck
of left femur” (Compl., ¶22) and that she was prevented from receiving
necessary, timely medical care as she was not taken to Glendale Adventist
Hospital until April 28, 2022.  On April
29, 2022, Plaintiff underwent a partial hip replacement surgery to repair the
fracture and was discharged on May 9, 2022 and readmitted to Alameda Care
Center.  Although Defendants knew of
Plaintiff’s condition and that she was a fall risk, Plaintiff alleges that she
fell and complained of pain on April 3, 2023, was again found on the floor of
her bed on April 8, 2023, fell again on June 15, 2023, was found to have
scabies and rashes all over her body on October 12, 2023, fell again on
November 11, 2023 while unattended on a walk, and fell again on November 28,
2023 while on a walk.  
            The complaint, filed on January 16,
2024, alleges causes of action for: (1) elder abuse (Welfare & Institutions
Code, § 15600 et seq.); (2) negligence; (3) violation of Health &
Safety Code, § 1430(b); and (4) willful misconduct.  
B.    
Relevant Background
On February 29, 2024, Defendants Artesia
Healthcare, Inc. dba Alameda Care Center and Longwood Management, LLC filed a
motion to compel arbitration.  On March
28, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for trial preference pursuant to CCP § 36(a)
and (e).  The Court held a hearing on the
two motions on May 3, 2024, and took the matters under submission.  
On May 8, 2024, the Court granted the
motion to compel arbitration for the periods of Plaintiff’s admission from
March 29, 2022 to October 31, 2023 at the facility. The Court granted Defendants’
request for a stay of the action pending the resolution of the arbitration
(including claims following October 31, 2023 after Plaintiff was transferred
from the facility to a hospital, until December 29, 2023 when she was
transferred to a different care facility). 
The Court set an Arbitration Status Conference for November 6,
2024.  
The Court took Plaintiff’s motion for
trial preference off-calendar as moot. 
The Court stated that once the arbitration was complete, the Court would
reexamine the need to prioritize the trial of any remaining claims.  
C.    
Motion on Calendar 
On July 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion
for trial preference pursuant to CCP § 36(a) and (e).  
On August 5, 2024, Defendants filed an
opposition brief.  
On August 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply
brief. 
DISCUSSION

            Plaintiff moves for trial preference
so that trial will be set within 120 days of the hearing date.  The Court notes that no trial date has been
set in this action. 
On May 8, 2024, the Court granted the
motion to compel arbitration for the periods of Plaintiff’s admission from
March 29, 2022 to October 31, 2023 at the facility. The Court granted
Defendants’ request for a stay of the action pending the resolution of the
arbitration (including claims following October 31, 2023 after Plaintiff was
transferred from the facility to a hospital, until December 29, 2023 when she
was transferred to a different care facility). 
The Court set an Arbitration Status Conference for November 6,
2024.  The Court took Plaintiff’s motion
for trial preference off-calendar as moot. 
The Court stated that once the arbitration was complete, the Court would
reexamine the need to prioritize the trial of any remaining claims.  
            Thus, the Court finds Plaintiff’s
motion for trial preference to be improper at this time.  As indicated above, the action has been
stayed pending the resolution of the arbitration.  Plaintiff has not requested a lift from the
stay for the Court to consider this motion on its merits.  (The Court notes that while it did not rule
on the first motion for trial preference, this second attempt at moving for
trial preference is essentially an improper motion for reconsideration of the
Court’s order staying the action and statement that it would reexamine the need
to prioritize trial of any remaining claims following the arbitration.)  
The Court notes
that in the reply brief, Plaintiffs argue that they are not seeking any damages
for injuries before October 31, 2023 and are only seeking damages for injuries
occurring on and after October 31, 2023, such that there is no need for the action
to proceed to arbitration.  (Reply at p.
2.)  If this is the case, the parties
should meet and confer regarding whether the arbitration is necessary and
stipulating to whether Plaintiffs will be pursuing any claims for damages prior
to October 31, 2023, and whether in light of that stipulation the stay should
be lifted.  
However, at this
time, as the action is stayed, the motion for trial
preference is denied.  Plaintiff may move
for trial preference following the conclusion of the arbitration proceedings.  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Plaintiff’s
motion for trial preference is denied.   The action is currently stayed pending the
resolution of the arbitration.  Plaintiff may move for trial preference following the conclusion of
the arbitration proceedings.  
Plaintiff shall
provide notice of this order.
