And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for statutory attorney's fees filed by Plaintiff Tommy Sabre Buttner. The motion was filed after the plaintiff prevailed in a trial against Defendant Alternative Automotive Solutions, LLC, on a claim that the defendant sold a used, unsafe, and defective vehicle to the plaintiff.

The judge finds that the plaintiff is entitled to attorney's fees and costs under the Consumers Legal Remedies Act and the Unfair Competition Law, and that the amount of fees requested is reasonable. The judge reduces the hourly rates of some of the attorneys who worked on the case, but awards a total of $12,000 in attorney's fees.

The judge notes that the defendant did not dispute the plaintiff's entitlement to fees, and that the motion was granted in part. The judge orders that the plaintiff provide notice of the order.
