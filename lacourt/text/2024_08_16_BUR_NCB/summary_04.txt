And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling dismissing the complaint filed by Vicki Corona against J. Woods, Serial #1520, et al. The complaint alleged that the defendants, who are park rangers employed by the City of Los Angeles, violated Corona's constitutional rights by issuing citations to her vehicle for failure to register.

The judge ruled that the issue of whether the vehicle registration requirement is constitutional was previously litigated in the Corona Injunction Case, and that Corona's claims are barred by collateral estoppel. The judge also found that Corona has not alleged an actual deprivation of her use of the motor vehicle for transportation or shelter, and that the vehicle registration requirement is a reasonable burden on the right to travel.

The judge also ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the complaint was sustained without leave to amend, and that the case is dismissed with prejudice.
