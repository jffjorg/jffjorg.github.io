  [TENTATIVE] order RE:
motions to set aside default
 



            
BACKGROUND 
A.   
Allegations 
Plaintiffs Vigan Sardariani (“Sardariani”) and V&S Complete Auto
Repairs, Inc. (“V&S”) allege that this action involves a 22-year-old lease
relationship between Sardariani and Defendant Roland Markarian (“Markarian”)
concerning real property located at 7139 Foothill Blvd., Tujunga, CA 91042 (the
“Foothill Property”).  The Court will
call this the “Fraud Action” in its subsequent discussion, based on the Court’s
review of its nine causes of action. 
In the Fraud Action, Plaintiffs allege that Markarian rented the Foothill
Property in Tujunga on May 1, 2002 subject to the lease agreement with
Sardariani.  Plaintiffs allege that
Markarian sued Plaintiffs on May 11, 2022 in Pasadena Case No. 22PDUD00815, Markarian
v. Sardariani.  Plaintiffs alleged
that on June 8, 2016, Markarian, without notice to Plaintiffs, transferred
ownership of the leased property to Defendant RRRM Holding Company, LLC
(“RRRM”).  Plaintiffs allege that Markarian
and RRRM persuaded Plaintiffs’ sublessor, Defendants Ara Ahanjanyan and Arman
Artunyan, to breach their sublease with Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs allege that on December 29, 2023,
RRRM initiated an unlawful detainer action in Burbank Case No. 23BBCV03087, RRRM
Holding Company, LLC v. Sardariani. 
Plaintiffs allege that RRRM has made false representations that it
leased property to Sardariani, that rent had increased (without proper notice),
and that RRRM performed all terms and conditions on the lease when it had
not.  
The first amended complaint (“FAC”), filed March 14, 2024, alleges causes
of action for: (1) fraud; (2) intentional concealment; (3) negligent
misrepresentation; (4) breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing; (5)
breach of contract; (6) tortious interference with prospective economic
advantage; (7) negligent interference with prospective economic advantage; (8)
intentional interference with contractual relations; and (9) inducing breach of
contract. 
On July 16, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an Amendment to Complaint Naming Doe
No. 1, naming Rejina Mehdian as Doe 1. 
B.    
Relevant Background and Motions on Calendar 
On May 16, 2024, the defaults of Roland Markarian, RRRM Holding
Company, LLC, Ara Ohanjanyan, and Arman Arutunyan was entered. 
There are 4 motions on calendar. On June 21, 2024, Defendants Roland
Markarian, RRRM Holding Company, LLC, Ara Ohanjanyan, and Arman Arutunyan each
filed a motion to set aside the default entered on May 16, 2024.  
On August 5, 2024, Sardariani and V&S filed a single opposition
brief. 
On August 12, 2024, Defendants filed a singly reply brief. 
DISCUSSION 
            Defendants each
filed a motion to set aside the default entered on May 16, 2024, arguing that
Plaintiffs’ counsel was fully aware that Defendants were represented by counsel
and did not inform defense counsel Raymond Zakari that their default would be
taken, Defendants filed a timely response but the clerk did not enter the
demurrer in the record or place it on calendar, and the default was entered as
a result of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  
            In support of the
motions, Defendants provide the declaration of Mr. Zakari.  Mr. Zakari states that Plaintiffs filed their
FAC on March 14, 2024 and Defendants filed their demurrer on April 24, 2024,
reserving a hearing date for May 16, 2024. 
(Zakari Decl., ¶¶5-6, Ex. A.)  He
states that on May 14, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel, without consulting defense
counsel, filed a request for entry of default, and then filed an amended
request for entry of default on May 16, 2024. 
(Id., ¶¶7-8, Exs. B-C.)  On
May 16, 2024, Defendants’ default was entered. 
(Id., ¶9.)  Mr. Zakari
states that the parties have been involved in 5 separate and ongoing
litigations and have been regularly exchanging documents, such that Plaintiffs’
counsel was aware that Defendants were represented by counsel for years.  (Id., ¶10.)  Mr. Zakari states that while he filed a
demurrer and reserved a hearing date, the clerk appears not to have filed the
demurrer or placed it on the Court’s docket, which led to the Court entering
the default in Plaintiffs’ favor.  (Id.,
¶11.)  He states that the filing of the
demurrer was a responsive pleading to the FAC, such that the defaults are
legally moot and untimely.  (Id.,
¶12.)
            The Court has reviewed
Exhibit A, which includes Defendants’ proposed demurrer.  The document is not accompanied by a
reservation number or proof of a reservation through the Court’s online
reservation system; instead, it states” Reservation ID: N/A [Reserved by
Court].”  Defendants have not provided
any documentary evidence showing when the demurrer was specially reserved by
the Court via a minute order, which would have been necessary for Defendants to
obtain a specially reserved hearing date for the clerk to calendar on a
specific date.  The Court’s docket also
does not show that a demurrer was filed on April 24, 2024 (there were no
filings that day), but the Court notes that on May 3, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an
opposition to a demurrer to the FAC (hearing date May 16, 2024).  This at least indicates that Plaintiffs were
served with the demurrer, even though none was filed with the Court.  The motions will not be granted on the basis
that the Court lacked authority to enter the default as a result of Defendants
filing the demurrer, as no demurrer was filed with the Court on April 24, 2024
and Defendants have not shown that a demurrer date was specially reserved for
May 16, 2024 (through the online system or upon request made to the
Court).  
            Next, Defendants argue
that the default should be set aside pursuant to CCP § 473(b) for the default
entered against them despite their belief that they filed a demurrer.  They also argue that the policy in favor of
hearing actions on their merits and the rules favoring civility in civil
procedure should be applied.  The policy of the law strongly favors a
hearing on the merits, which supports granting these 4 motions.  (Thompson
v. Sutton (1942) 50 Cal.App.2d 272, 276.) 
Defendants rely on Lasalle v. Vogel (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th 127, arguing that
Plaintiffs’ counsel should have informed defense counsel about the impending
default.  
            Here, Defendants have
shown that they acted in good faith, believing that they filed a responsive
pleading in the form of the demurrer to the complaint.  It is apparent that they served the demurrer
on Plaintiffs as Plaintiffs filed a substantive opposition brief on May 3,
2024, indicating that the hearing was set for May 16, 2024.  The Court finds that there is a sufficient
basis on the part of Defendants to show that the default was entered as a
result of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  In addition, as stated above, policy favors
hearing actions on their merits.  
            As such, the motions to
set aside the defaults are granted.  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Defendants Roland Markarian, RRRM Holding
Company, LLC, Ara Ohanjanyan, and Arman Arutunyan’s motions to vacate the
default entered on May 16, 2024 are granted. 
Defendants are ordered to file a responsive pleading following the
hearing on this matter. 
Defendants shall provide notice of this
order.
