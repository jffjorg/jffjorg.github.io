And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to a demurrer filed by Defendant Max's Glendale to the complaint filed by Plaintiff Christopher M. Mirabueno on April 5, 2024. The demurrer argues that the complaint is time-barred and lacks sufficient factual allegations to support a cause of action. The Judge agrees with the demurrer, finding that the complaint is uncertain and lacks factual allegations. The Judge sustains the demurrer, giving Plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint. The demurrer is based on the statute of limitations periods, which would have elapsed if the wrongful termination was based on a written or oral contract, or a violation of public policy. The Judge also notes that the complaint fails to allege any actual factual allegations to support the claim for wrongful termination. The Judge allows Plaintiff an opportunity to amend the complaint, but sustains the demurrer in its current form.
