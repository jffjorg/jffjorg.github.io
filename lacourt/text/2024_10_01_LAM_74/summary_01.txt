And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Dwayne J. Chomyk, in his motion for monetary sanctions against the defendant, Christina Development Corporation. The plaintiff was fired by the defendant and alleges that he was fired for objecting to fraudulent business practices. The defendant failed to pay arbitration fees, which led to the plaintiff's motion for sanctions.

The judge has awarded the plaintiff $46,670 in attorney's fees and $161.60 in costs. The fees were incurred as a result of the defendant's failure to pay arbitration fees and the plaintiff's motion to return the claims to the superior court. However, the judge has reduced the fees incurred in preparing the motion for sanctions, finding that 29 hours of work was unreasonable.

The judge has also denied the defendant's argument that the fees incurred in fighting the initial arbitration agreement were not a result of the material breach or associated with the abandoned arbitration proceeding. The judge has awarded the plaintiff fees for communicating with the arbitration company and arbitrator.

Overall, the judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for monetary sanctions in the amount of $46,831.60.
