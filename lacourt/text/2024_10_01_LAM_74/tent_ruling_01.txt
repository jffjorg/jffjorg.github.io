  Case Number:  20STCV39869    Hearing Date:   October 1, 2024    Dept:  74 Chomyk v. Christina Development
Corporation
Plaintiff Dwayne J. Chomyk’s Motion for
Monetary Sanctions.
 
BACKGROUND 
            On
October 16, 2020, plaintiff Dwayne J. Chomyk (Plaintiff) filed a complaint for
wrongful termination against defendant Christina Development Corporation (Defendant).
Plaintiff alleged that he was fired for objecting to fraudulent business
practices. 
            Plaintiff
signed an arbitration agreement upon starting employment with Defendant. Plaintiff
was later fired by Defendant. When Plaintiff filed his complaint for wrongful
termination, Defendant moved to compel arbitration. The Court granted the
motion to compel arbitration. Defendant initiated arbitration in November of
2021. In February 2023, Defendant failed to pay arbitration fees within 30 days
of its due date. In May 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to allow his
claims to be pursued in court. 
            On
June 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed his motion for sanctions. 
 
DISCUSSION  
¿¿            Attorney’s
fees may be recovered as costs when authorized by contract, statute, or
law.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(10).) The statutes that apply here are
Code of Civil Procedure § 1281.98, subdivision (c)(1) [“all attorney’s fees and
all costs associated with the abandoned arbitration proceeding”] and §1281.99, subdivision
(a) [“attorney’s fees and costs incurred . . . as a result of the material
breach”]. Plaintiff seeks $213,830.18 in sanctions. 
            Defendant
argues that the motion should be denied because only a limited amount of the
requested sanctions is associated with the “abandoned arbitration proceeding”,
that Plaintiff has not incurred any expenses because Plaintiff’s counsel is
retained on contingency, and that the evidentiary showing for the fees is
inadequate.
The fee setting inquiry in
California ordinarily begins with the “lodestar” method. “It is well
established that the determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees
is committed to the discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be
reversed in the absence of an abuse of discretion. [Citations.]  The value
of legal services performed in a case is a matter in which the trial court has
its own expertise. . . . The trial court makes its determination after
consideration of a number of factors, including the nature of the litigation,
its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in its handling, the
skill employed, the attention given, the success or failure, and other
circumstances in the case.  [Citations.]”  (Melnyk v. Robledo
(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623624.) 
No specific findings reflecting
the court’s calculations are required.  The court’s focus in evaluating
the facts should be to provide a fee award reasonably designed to compensate
attorneys for the services provided.  The starting point for this
determination is the attorney’s time records.  (Horsford v. Board of
Trustees of Calif. State Univ. (2005) 132¿Cal.App.4th 359, 395-397
[verified time records entitled to credence absent clear indication they are
erroneous].)  However, California case law permits fee awards in the
absence of detailed time sheets.  (Sommers v. Erb (1992) 2
Cal.App.4th 1644, 1651; Dunk v. Ford Motor Co. (1996) 48¿Cal.App.4th
1794, 1810; Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th
99, 103.)  An experienced trial judge is in a position to assess the value
of the professional services rendered in his or her court.  (Id.; Serrano
v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49; Wershba v. Apple Computer, Inc.
(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 224, 255.)
            Plaintiff’s
attorney has been practicing for over 30 years and his ordinary hourly rate is
$650 per hour.  (Cowan Decl., ¶¶ 15, 23.)
Plaintiff is entitled to sanctions under the Code of Civil Procedure § 1281.99,
which allows for monetary sanctions for the “reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees and costs, incurred by the employee… as a result of the
material breach.”  Any hours and fees
incurred from the time of the breach, including the motion to return the claims
to the superior court and this motion are a result of the material breach.  
The
Court finds that 33 hours arising out of Defendant’s failure to pay and the
motion to return the claims to the superior court is reasonable. The Court
finds that 29 hours to prepare the motion for sanctions is unreasonable because
of the 8 hours expended in research given how little case law exists; the Court
reduces the time to 22 hours. The Court also awards $80.80 in fees for the
motion to vacate the arbitration and an additional $80.80 for this motion and
reply brief.
However,
the Court finds that the fees incurred in fighting the initial arbitration
agreement were not a “result of the material breach” (§ 1281.99(a)) or
“associated with the abandoned arbitration proceeding” (§ 1281.98(c)) because
the fees incurred in opposing the motion to compel occurred outside of the
“arbitration proceeding.”  The Court
finds that the reasonable fees associated with the arbitration proceeding
include the 16.8 hours Plaintiff incurred related to communicating with the
arbitration company and arbitrator.
            The
Court awards $46,670 (33 hrs. + 22 hrs. + 16.8 hrs.) in attorney’s fees and $161.60
in costs.
CONCLUSION 
The
Court grants Plaintiff’s motion for monetary sanctions in the amount of $46,831.60.  
Plaintiff
shall give notice.
