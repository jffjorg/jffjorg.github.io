And here is a summary in English text:

The Honorable Gary Y. Tanaka issued a tentative ruling in the case Fuji Merchandise Corp., et al. v. Cha Hee Nagashima Lee, et al. (Case No. 24TRCV01749). James J. Berdelle's application to appear as counsel pro hac vice for the plaintiffs was denied without prejudice.

The application was denied due to the applicant's failure to demonstrate that proper notice of the hearing was provided to all parties, including the State Bar. The notice of motion did not provide sufficient information regarding the date, time, and department of the hearing. Additionally, the court continued the original hearing date and ordered plaintiffs' counsel to give notice, but the notice was not provided.

The court ordered the plaintiffs to give notice of this ruling. The applicant failed to pay a reasonable fee of $50 to the State Bar of California with the copy of the application and the notice of hearing.
