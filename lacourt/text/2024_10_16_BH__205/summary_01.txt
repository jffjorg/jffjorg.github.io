Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Edward B. Moreton Jr. in the case of Almont BH Partners LLC v. Morgan and Marcus, Inc. dba Morgan & Co. The case involves an unlawful detainer action, where Plaintiff alleges Defendant failed to pay rent due under a written commercial lease. Cross-Complainant Marcus Rosner filed a Cross-Complaint against Cross-Defendants Paolo Mazoli and Kia Zoghi, alleging they agreed to defend, indemnify, and hold him harmless against claims by Plaintiff. Rosner's motion to set aside the dismissal of the Cross-Complaint and enter default judgment against Cross-Defendants is denied.

The Judge concludes that Rosner is not entitled to mandatory relief under California Code of Civil Procedure ยง 473(b) because the dismissal was for failure to prosecute, rather than a procedural equivalent of a default. The Judge also denies discretionary relief because Rosner failed to provide a reasonable explanation for missing the July conference, which would have given him notice of the August conference.
