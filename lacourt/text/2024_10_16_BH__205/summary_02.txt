And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to set aside default filed by defendants ESTRADA BUILDING SERVICES, LLC and ABRAHAM ESTRADA. The defendants are seeking to set aside the default judgment entered against them on April 22, 2024, due to alleged mistakes and neglect by their counsel. The judge has found that the defendants have met the substantive requirements for mandatory relief under Code of Civil Procedure §473(b) and will vacate the default. The judge notes that while the defendants' counsel's errors may be inexcusable, the mandatory relief provisions do not require a showing of excusable neglect. The judge has granted the motion to set aside default against defendant ABRAHAM ESTRADA, but has not addressed the issue of default against defendant ESTRADA BUILDING SERVICES, LLC, as there is no proof of service for that defendant.
