Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendants' motion to stay enforcement of the judgment. The defendants, Fame Housing Corporation, et al., argue that the funds in the levied accounts are exempt from execution due to their role as non-profit management entities and the lack of notice and due process in the issuance of the writ of execution. However, the court finds no basis for this claim, as the defendants failed to establish any exemption under California Code of Civil Procedure section 704.220 and failed to show any superior right to the funds.

The court also finds that the issuance of the writ of execution was a ministerial act and that the defendants' failure to comply with the notice requirements did not affect the execution lien created by the levy. The court further finds that the defendants' reliance on the "minimum basic standard of adequate care for a family of four for Region 1" exemption is misplaced, as this exemption applies only to natural persons, not corporate entities.

Finally, the court denies the motion on the grounds that the defendants failed to establish any procedural challenge caused by the ministerial issuance of the writ and that the defendants failed to show any basis for relief from collection simply based on declarations in support.
