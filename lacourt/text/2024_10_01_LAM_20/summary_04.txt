  - "A plaintiff's forum choice 'should rarely be disturbed unless the balance is strongly in favor of the defendant.'"
  - "The reasons advanced for this frequently reiterated rule apply only to residents of the forum state: (1) if the plaintiff is a resident of the jurisdiction in which the suit is filed, the plaintiff's choice of forum is presumed to be convenient [citations]; and (2) a state has a strong interest in assuring its own residents an adequate forum for the redress of grievances."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to dismiss the case for forum non conveniens. The defendants argue that the case should be heard in Delaware because the plaintiff is a resident of Canada or Norway, the defendant is a resident of Spain, and the company is incorporated in Delaware. They also argue that the alleged agreement between the plaintiff and defendant regarding the company was formed in Mexico, and that the fiduciary duties at issue arise under Delaware law. The defendants claim that Delaware is a suitable alternative forum, but the judge finds that they have failed to provide sufficient evidence to support this claim. The judge notes that the plaintiff's choice of forum should rarely be disturbed unless the balance is strongly in favor of the defendant, and that the defendants have not shown that litigating in Delaware would be significantly more convenient or just than litigating in California. The judge denies the motion to dismiss and orders the case to proceed in California.
