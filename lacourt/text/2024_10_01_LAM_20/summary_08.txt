The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a wrongful foreclosure matter, where non-party Fleet Capital, Inc. is seeking leave to file an answer in intervention. The Judge is considering whether Fleet Capital, Inc. has a mandatory or discretionary right to intervene in the action. Under Code Civ. Proc. ยง 387, intervention is mandatory if the party seeking to intervene claims an interest relating to the property or transaction and the disposition of the action may impair or impede that party's ability to protect its interest. The Judge has granted the Motion, as Fleet Capital, Inc. seems to have an interest in the subject property and there is no opposition. The Judge has also granted the Request for Judicial Notice (RJN) and encouraged counsel to submit on the tentative or appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
