 This is a wrongful foreclosure matter.  Non-party Fleet Capital, Inc. now seeks leave to file an answer in intervention.Code Civ. Proc. § 387 provides for instances in which intervention is mandatory and discretionary.  Intervention is mandatory where “[a] provision of law confers an unconditional right to intervene [or] [t]he person seeking intervention claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action and that person is so situated that the disposition of the action may impair or impede that person’s ability to protect that interest, unless that person’s interest is adequately represented by one or more of the existing parties.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 387(d)(1).)  Discretionary intervention is allowable when “the nonparty has a direct and immediate interest in the litigation; . . . [t]he intervention will not enlarge the issues in the case; and [t]he reasons for intervention outweigh any opposition by the existing parties.”  (Truck Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 342, 346.)Because Fleet Capital, Inc. seems to have an interest in the subject property and there is no opposition, the Motion is granted.  The RJN is granted. Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
