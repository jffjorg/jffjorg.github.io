```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Court has denied Horton's motion to quash and/or for a protective order related to deposition subpoenas issued by Kim. The subpoenas seek business records from third-party attorneys that reflect cost-sharing agreements in past cases where Horton and the attorneys were co-counsel. The Court finds that the cost-sharing documents are relevant to Horton's claims against Kim and are not subject to attorney-client privilege or work-product doctrine, as they relate to old, terminated cases. The Court also rejects Horton's argument that the documents would invade the confidentiality of settlement agreements and finds that Horton's position was substantially justified in filing the Motion.
