Summary in English:

The Tentative Ruling grants the Defendant's motion for new trial on the grounds of excessive punitive damages award, but only conditionally. If the Plaintiff does not consent to the reduction of punitive damages from $2,500,000.00 to $588,000.00 within 30 days, a new trial will be granted. The court finds that the original punitive damages award was excessive and that a 7:1 ratio of punitive to compensatory damages is more appropriate. The court also denies the Defendant's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the same grounds as the motion for new trial.
