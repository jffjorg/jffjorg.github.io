And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the cross-defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend. The plaintiff, Giselle Rodriguez, had filed a complaint against the defendant, Inails & Spa, alleging personal injury from a slip and fall on the defendant's premises. The defendant had filed a cross-complaint against Rodriguez for abuse of process and intentional infliction of emotional distress, but the judge has ruled that the cross-complaint fails to state a cause of action. The judge has also ruled that Rodriguez' counsel allegedly failed to serve the new owner of Inails & Spa, which is not a valid cause of action. The judge has granted Rodriguez' motion for judgment on the pleadings, which means that the case will not proceed further.
