BACKGROUND
                
On February 14, 2023, Plaintiff Gisele
Rodriguez filed a complaint against Defendant Inails & Spa, asserting
claims for personal injury from a slip and fall on Defendant’s premises. Tuyen
Kim Nguyen was named as a Defendant but was purportedly only served in her
capacity as Inails & Spa’s registered agent for service of process. 
 
On August 7, 2023, Nguyen filed a
cross-complaint against Rodriguez for abuse of process and “IIED with the
extent of liability of eggshell skull rule in tort cases.” Rodriguez filed an
answer on September 11, 2023. Nguyen filed a “supplemental claim for cross-complaint"
on November 7, 2023 without leave of court. The August 7, 2023 cross-complaint
is form complaint with no facts alleged. The November 7, 2023 cross-complaint
alleges harm caused by Plaintiff’s counsel’s failure to serve the new owner of
Inails & Spa.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A motion for judgment on the pleadings is an appropriate means of
obtaining an adjudication of the rights of the parties in a declaratory relief
action if those rights can be determined as a matter of law from the face of
the pleading attacked, together with those matters of which the court may
properly take judicial notice. (Silver v. Beverly Hills Nat. Bank (1967)
253 Cal.App.2d 1000, 1005 [61 Cal.Rptr. 751].) A plaintiff's motion for
judgment on the pleadings is analogous to a plaintiff's demurrer to an answer
and is evaluated by the same standards. (See Hardy v. Admiral Oil Co.
(1961) 56 Cal.2d 836, 840-842 [16 Cal.Rptr. 894, 366 P.2d 310]; 4 Witkin, Cal.
Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Proceedings Without Trial, § 165, pp. 2819-2820.) The
motion should be denied if the defendant's pleadings raise a material issue or
set up affirmative matter constituting a defense; for purposes of ruling on the
motion, the trial court must treat all of the defendant's allegations as
being true. (MacIsaac v. Pozzo (1945) 26 Cal.2d 809, 813 [161 P.2d
449].)
 
(Allstate Ins. Co. v. Kim W.
(1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 326, 330–331.)
 
Rodriguez demurs to the cross-complaint
on the ground that it fails to allege sufficient facts to state causes of
action against Rodriguez. The Court agrees. As stated, Nguyen’s first
cross-complaint contains no facts; the supplemental cross-complaint appears to
allege that Rodriguez’ attorney wrongfully served Nguyen as the agent of
service for Inails & Spa even though she sold the business in 2017. These
facts do not support causes of action for abuse of process or intentional
infliction of emotional distress. Nguyen does not state how the cross-complaint
could be amended to state causes of action.
 
Rodriguez’ motion for judgment on the
pleadings is GRANTED without leave to amend.
