And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to compel the depositions of the defendants and a witness. The plaintiff filed the motion on September 10, 2024, seeking to compel the depositions of the defendants, Timothy Noonan and Arthur Carlin, as well as witness Said Taiym. The defendants opposed the motion, arguing that their depositions should be delayed until after the plaintiff's deposition, which is currently scheduled for December 5, 2024.

The judge found that the plaintiff has not shown that any of the deponents have failed to appear for their depositions or refused to schedule their depositions. The judge noted that the general practice is to take depositions in the order they are noticed, and that the plaintiff has not sufficiently articulated undue prejudice as a result of deposing the individuals after December 5, 2024.

The judge also noted that the trial is currently set for October 21, 2025, providing sufficient time to complete discovery. The judge stated that the plaintiff could have issued her deposition notices sooner had she wished to have priority in setting the deposition dates, and that waiting until after December 5, 2024 is not an unreasonable delay. The judge's tentative ruling is to deny the plaintiff's motion to compel depositions.
