And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees in the amount of $160,689.75. The plaintiff is the prevailing party in this action and is entitled to a reasonable amount of attorney fees. The issue to be addressed is the reasonableness of the requested amount of attorney fees, costs, and expenses.

The court finds that the reasonable hourly rate for the attorneys and paralegals who worked on this case is $400 per hour. The total number of billable hours claimed by the attorneys and paralegals was 260.6 hours, but the court finds that the reasonable hours spent by the attorneys and paralegals in this matter are 190 hours.

The court also finds that an upward adjustment to the lodestar (the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate) is not warranted in this action, as this was a straightforward lemon law case and there is no evidence that the plaintiff's counsel was precluded from taking other cases.

Based on these findings, the court grants the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees and awards $76,000.00 in attorney fees.
