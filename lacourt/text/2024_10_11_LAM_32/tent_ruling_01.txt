      [Proposed]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion for attorney fees 
 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            Plaintiffs Victor Ruiz and Amelia
Perez (“Plaintiffs”) commenced this action against Defendants Toyota Motor
Sales U.S.A., Inc. (“Toyota”) on April 20, 2021.   Plaintiff
asserted causes of action under the Song-Beverly Act.  . 
The Complaint alleges in pertinent part as
follows: On March 31, 2019, Plaintiffs purchased a new 2019 Toyota Tacoma (“Vehicle”)
manufactured by Toyota.  During the
warranty period the vehicle developed defects.
On June 13, 2024, a jury found that
Plaintiffs were entitled to a judgment in the amount of $48,481.00 for breach
of the implied warranty of merchantability.
LEGAL
STANDARD
Attorney’s fees are mandatory to the
prevailing plaintiff under the Song-Berverl Act.   (Kim v.Euromotors West/The Auto Gallery
(2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 170, 178; Drouin
v. Fleetwood Enterprises (1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 486, 493. Pursuant to California
Civil Code, Section 1780(e) : “[t]he court shall award court costs and
attorney’s fees to a prevailing plaintiff in litigation filed pursuant to this
section.” A prevailing plaintiff is someone who has obtained a net monetary
recovery on a Song-Beverly Act.  (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc.
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 150.)
 “The
verified time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are
entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are
erroneous.”  (Horsford v. Board Of Trustees Of California State University (2005)
132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396.)  If the motion
is supported by evidence, the opposing party must respond with specific
evidence showing that the fees are unreasonable.  (Premier
Med. Mgmt. Sys. v. California Ins. Guarantee Ass’n (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th
550, 560-63.)  The Court has discretion
to reduce fees that result from inefficient or duplicative use of time.  (Horsford,
supra, 132 Cal.App.4th at 395.)  
In determining a reasonable attorney fee,
the trial court begins with the lodestar, i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.  (Warren
v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24, 36.)  The lodestar may then be adjusted based on
factors specific to the case in order to fix the fee at the fair market value
of the legal services provided.  (Ibid.) 
These facts include (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions
involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which
the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4)
the contingent nature of the fee award. 
(Ibid.)
ANALYSIS
            Plaintiff moves for an award of
attorney fees in the amount of $160,689.75. 
 
            A.
Entitlement to Attorney Fees
On June 13, 2024, a jury found that
Plaintiffs were entitled to a judgment in the amount of $48,481.00 for breach
of the implied warranty of merchantability. 
As such, Plaintiffs are the prevailing party in this action, and as
prevailing party in this action, Plaintiffs are entitled to a reasonable amount
of attorney fees. The issue to be addressed is the reasonableness of the
requested amount of attorney fees, costs, and expenses.
B.
Reasonableness of Fees
1.
Reasonable Hourly Rates
Plaintiff retained Knight Law Group, LLP
(“Knight”).  A total of eighteen attorneys
and/or law clerks worked on this action with eight attorneys from SLP and two
attorneys from CCA billing hours on this matter.
The hourly rates claimed by Knight attorneys
and paralegals ranged between $175.00 and $550.00 per hour.
“In determining hourly rates, the court
must look to the ‘prevailing market rates in the relevant community.’”  (Heritage
Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 100.)  In making this determination, “[t]he court
may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity with the legal market.”  (Ibid.) 

The Court finds that $400 per hour is the
reasonable hourly rate in this case for Knight. 
  
2.
Hours Reasonably Expended
The total number of billable hours claimed
by Knight attorneys and paralegals was 260.6 hours.
            Toyota claims that the number of
hours billed is unreasonable.  
The Court finds that the reasonable hours
spent by Wirtz attorneys and paralegals in this matter are 190 hours.
In making this determination, the court
found that some of the billing was excessive, especially for attorneys as
experienced as plaintiff’s counsel. Plaintiff had at least eighteen  attorneys and/or paralegals working on this
case.  While plaintiff has the right to
have multiple attorneys, the court finds that some of the attorneys’ work were
duplicative and redundant.  
C.
Multiplier 
Plaintiff requests a lodestar multiplier
enhancement.  Defendant requests a
negative lodestar multiplier.
 The
Court finds that an upward adjustment to the lodestar is not warranted in this
action. This was a straightforward lemon law case.  There is no evidence that Plaintiff’s counsel
was precluded from taking other cases. A downward adjustment to the lodestar is
not warranted either as Plaintiff’s counsel took this case on a contingency.
D.
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing reasons,
Plaintiff’s motion for attorney fees is GRANTED.  The Court awards $76,000.00 in attorney fees.
