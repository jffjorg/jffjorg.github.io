  Case No.:  24STCV17170
  Hearing Date:  October 11, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to compel depositions
  




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On July 10, 2024, Plaintiff Jane Doe
filed this action against Defendants Lockton Companies LLC – Pacific Series,
Timothy Noonan, and Arthur Carlin. The complaint asserts (1) discrimination,
(2) harassment, (3) retaliation, (4) failure to prevent, and (5) wrongful
termination.
            On September 10, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant motion to compel the depositions of Defendants Noonan and
Carlin, as well as witness Said Taiym. Defendant Lockton filed its opposition
on September 30, 2024. Plaintiff filed her reply on October 7, 2024.  
LEGAL STANDARD
“If, after service of a deposition notice,
a party to the action . . . without having served a valid objection under
Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination . . . or
to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or
tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice
may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and
the production for inspection of any document … described in the deposition
notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450(a).)
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff served the deposition
notices on August 9, 2024, setting the depositions for September 2024.
(Zilifyan Decl., Ex. 2.) Defendants objected to the notices and asserted that
their depositions could not proceed until after Plaintiff’s deposition, which
was noticed first. (Id., Ex. 3, 4.) Plaintiff’s deposition is currently
scheduled for December 5, 2024. (Id., Ex. 5.) Plaintiff contends that it
would be unreasonable to delay Defendants’ and Taiym’s depositions to December
2024. 
            Plaintiff has not shown that any of
the deponents have failed to appear for their depositions or refused to
schedule their depositions. The record indicates that Defendants intend on
producing the individuals for deposition. Plaintiff merely wishes to have the
depositions proceed sooner than December 5, 2024.
            However, the general practice is to
take depositions in the order they are noticed. (See State Bar of California
Attorney Guidelines of Civility and Professionalism, § 9a(1).) Plaintiff does
not sufficiently articulate undue prejudice as a result of deposing the
individuals after December 5, 2024. Plaintiff does not explain why conducting
the depositions after December 5, 2024 would disrupt the discovery process, or
why she needs the depositions immediately. The trial is currently set for
October 21, 2025, providing sufficient time to complete discovery. Plaintiff
may also request a trial continuance if that becomes necessary. 
The Court finds that waiting until after
December 5, 2024 is not an unreasonable delay. Plaintiff could have issued her
deposition notices sooner had she wished to have priority in setting the
deposition dates. Although the civility guidelines are nonbinding, they do
represent the ordinary accepted practices, and Plaintiff has articulated no
reason to deviate from these practices in this particular case.  
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to compel
depositions is DENIED.
