JASON CASASOLA,
                        Plaintiff,
            v.
 
CHLOE’S APARTMENTS, LLC,
  et al., 
                        Defendants.
  


 
  Case No.:  20STCV42255
  Hearing Date:  October 11, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendants’ motion to compel deposition 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On November 4, 2020, Plaintiff Jason
Casasola filed this action against Defendants Chloe’s Apartments, LLC,
Apartment Management Group, LLC, Adrian Malin, Dan Zuckerman, and Does 1 to 25,
asserting thirteen causes of action stemming from alleged uninhabitable
conditions. This case has been consolidated with Shawnqa Edwards, et al. v.
Eloise Williams, et al. (22STCV00005), with this case as the lead case.
            On September 16, 2024, Defendants
Chloe’s Apartments, LLC, Apartment Management Group, LLC, and Malin Asset
Management, Inc. filed the instant motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff
Shawnqa Edwards. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.    
LEGAL STANDARD
“If, after service of a deposition notice,
a party to the action . . . without having served a valid objection under
Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination . . . or
to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or
tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice
may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and
the production for inspection of any document … described in the deposition
notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450(a).)
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff Edwards’ deposition has
been rescheduled multiple times. (Carpenter Decl. ¶ 3.) The deposition
partially took place on February 13, 2024, but Plaintiff suspended the
deposition to take her child to the doctor. (Id., ¶ 4.) Most recently,
the deposition was set for August 30, 2024. (Id., ¶ 30.) Defendants
issued a deposition notice to this effect on August 16, 2024. (Id., Ex.
A.) Plaintiff did not appear on August 30, 2024. (Id., ¶ 6.) Defendants
attempted to meet and confer, but no alternative dates have been provided. (Id.,
¶ 7.)  
            The facts demonstrate that Plaintiff
has failed to appear for deposition despite a duly issued notice. Therefore, an
order compelling appearance is warranted. Sanctions are also warranted as
Plaintiff presents no substantial justification for failing to comply with
discovery. Defendants reasonably request $810. (See Carpenter Decl. ¶ 9.)
CONCLUSION
            Defendants’ motion to compel
deposition is GRANTED. Plaintiff Shawnqa Edwards shall appear for deposition
within 20 days of this order. The Court sanctions Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s
counsel in the total amount of $810, to be paid within 30 days of this order.
