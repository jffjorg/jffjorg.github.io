Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to stay or dismiss the arbitration, but has stayed the action pending the outcome of the arbitration. The judge found that the court lacks authority to decide the issue of staying or dismissing the arbitration, as there is no legal mechanism for the court to do so. The judge also found that the Equal Access to Justice Act (EFAA) does not apply, as it only invalidates certain arbitration agreements, not existing arbitrations. The judge further found that the defendants' argument that the plaintiff has waived its right to compel arbitration is not relevant, as there is no motion to compel arbitration at issue. Finally, the judge granted a stay of the action pending the outcome of the arbitration, as the claims in the arbitration and the action overlap and a stay will prevent duplicity and inconsistent findings.
