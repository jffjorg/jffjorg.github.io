Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by the parties in this case. The plaintiff's motion for relief from the effect of late served responses is denied. The plaintiff's failure to timely respond to discovery requests was not due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and therefore the court finds that the plaintiff's responses were not substantially compliant with the Civil Discovery Act.

On the other hand, the defendant's motion to continue the trial date and related deadlines is granted. The defendant has shown good cause for the continuance, and the court finds that allowing more time for the resolution of discovery motions will not prejudice the parties. The new trial date is set for July 21, 2025, and the final status conference is continued to July 7, 2025.
