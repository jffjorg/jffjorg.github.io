And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees and costs incurred on appeal. The plaintiff sought $17,094.20 in fees and costs from the defendants and their attorneys, citing the appellate court's decision dated May 15, 2024. The defendants argued that the trial court does not have jurisdiction to entertain or decide the motion, as no remittitur has issued and the appellate process is still underway with a petition for review pending before the California Supreme Court. The judge agreed with the defendants, citing California Rules of Court, Rules 3.1702 and 8.278, which allow a motion for attorney fees to be brought upon remittitur of appeal. As no remittitur has been issued, the judge denied the plaintiff's motion.
