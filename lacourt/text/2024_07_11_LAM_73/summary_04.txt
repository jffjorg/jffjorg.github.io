And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Roosevelt White v. Vanmar Capital LLC. The Court has sustained Defendant's demurrer to the Complaint's third cause of action for Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, but has given Plaintiff 20 days to amend the Complaint. The Court has overruled Defendant's demurrer to the rest of the Complaint.

The Court has also granted Plaintiff's request for judicial notice of certain documents, including the United States Bankruptcy Court's Order of Dismissal filed in the bankruptcy case. The Court has also overruled Defendant's objections to Plaintiff's declaration.

Defendant had demurred to the entire Complaint, arguing that Plaintiff's current Chapter 13 bankruptcy action in the United States Bankruptcy Court of California's Central Division made this Court lack jurisdiction over the state court action. Plaintiff argued that the bankruptcy case was dismissed on May 21, 2024, making this argument moot. The Court has found that Defendant's demurrer to the entire Complaint was not sustained.

The Court has also considered the allegations in the Complaint regarding Plaintiff's loan with Defendant and Defendant's alleged interference with Plaintiff's ability to renovate and sell the property. The Court has found that Plaintiff has failed to plead sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
