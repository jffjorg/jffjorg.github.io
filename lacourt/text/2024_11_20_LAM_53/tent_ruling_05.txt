DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Anthony Gonzalez (“Plaintiff”) seeks an order approving the
settlement of his claims under the Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of
2004 (Labor Code, §¿2698, et seq.) (“PAGA”), set forth in the “Private
Attorneys General Act (PAGA) Settlement Agreement and Release” (the “Settlement
Agreement”), entered into by and between Plaintiff, on the one hand, and
defendant Almansor Court, Inc. (“Defendant”), on the other hand. 
The parties have reached a settlement of $250,000.  (Mara Decl., Ex. 1, Settlement Agreement, ¶
3.1.) 
Labor Code section 2699, subdivision (l)(2) provides that “[t]he
superior court shall review and approve any settlement of any civil action
pursuant to” PAGA.  The court’s review of PAGA settlements “ensur[es] that
any negotiated resolution is fair to those affected.”¿ (Williams v. Superior
Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 549.)¿ In an effort to aid the court in the
determination of the fairness of the settlement, Wershba v. Apple Computer,
Inc. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 224, 244-245 (disapproved on other grounds),
discusses factors that the court should consider when determining the
reasonableness of a settlement agreement.¿ “[A] presumption of fairness exists
where: (1) the settlement is reached through arm’s-length bargaining; (2)
investigation and discovery are sufficient to allow counsel and the court to
act intelligently; (3) counsel is experienced in similar litigation; and (4)
the percentage of objectors is small.”¿ (Id. at p. 245.)¿ “[T]he test is
not the maximum amount plaintiffs might have obtained at trial on the
complaint, but rather whether the settlement is reasonable under all of the
circumstances.”¿ (Id. at p. 250.)¿¿¿¿ 
The court has reviewed (1) the terms of the Settlement Agreement,
including (i) the amounts of the gross settlement ($250,000), Plaintiff’s
enhancement payment ($10,000), attorney’s fees ($83,333.33) and litigation
costs ($9,270.19),[1] administration
expenses ($2,900),[2]
and the net settlement amounts of the PAGA payments, 75 percent of which ($108,372.28)
will be paid to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency and 25 percent of
which ($36,124.10) will be paid to the aggrieved employees, (ii) the calculation
of payments and the settlement administration procedures, and (iii) the Notice
of PAGA Settlement and Release; (2) the declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel, in
which counsel (i) states that the parties engaged in discovery, resulting in
the production of over one thousand documents, (ii) states that the parties reached
settlement after the parties engaged in mediation, (iii) states that the
parties’ “settlement is the product of serious, informed, non-collusive
negotiations,” and (iv) describes the experience of counsel; and (3) the
declaration of Plaintiff, in which Plaintiff describes his involvement and
participation in this action in support of his request for an enhancement
payment.  (Mara Decl., Ex. 1, Settlement
Agreement, ¶¶ 3.1, 3.2., 3.2.2.1, 3.3, 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 4.4 and Ex. A; Mot., p.
8:6-8; Mara Decl., ¶¶ 1-11, 14-16, 36, 37; Springer Decl., ¶¶ 7-9; Gonzalez
Decl., ¶¶ 4-9.)  Based on the arguments
and evidence set forth in Plaintiff’s motion and the declaration of Plaintiff’s
counsel, the court finds that the Settlement Agreement is fair, reasonable, and
adequate.  (Wershba, supra,
91 Cal.App.th at pp. 244-245.)  The court therefore grants Plaintiff’s
motion. 
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiff Anthony
Gonzalez, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated and on behalf
of the general public’s motion for approval of PAGA settlement. 
            The court will sign and file the
“[Proposed] Order Granting Plaintiff’s Motion for Approval of PAGA Settlement;
Judgment,” lodged with the court by plaintiff Anthony Gonzalez, on behalf of
himself and all others similarly situated and on behalf of the general public,
on July 16, 2024 (as modified by the court). 
            The court orders plaintiff Anthony
Gonzalez, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated and on behalf
of the general public, to give notice of this ruling and the “Order Granting
Plaintiff’s Motion for Approval of PAGA Settlement; Judgment.”
IT IS SO ORDERED.
