[1] The
first, second, and fifth causes of action are alleged against defendant
Scottsdale.  Further, on April 15, 2022,
the court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to the sixth cause of action for
tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing with
leave to amend.  (April 15, 2022 Order,
p. 2:9-11, 2:17-19.)  Plaintiff did not
file a Second Amended Complaint. 


[2] While
the court notes that the underlying complaint appeared to allege facts that
applied to both Plaintiff and Defendant equally, there also appeared to be
facts alleged that related directly to Plaintiff’s alleged wrongful acts or
omissions that were completely independent of Defendant’s conduct.  (See, e.g., RJN Ex. 3, First Amended
Complaint in Case No. BC568601, ¶¶ 18, subd. (c) [alleging that Plaintiff
failed to learn about the indicators of abuse of students or unreasonably
ignored them with respect to Jane Doe], 44 [alleging that Plaintiff,
Mullholland Middle School, and John L. White failed to implement proper
security measures around the school campus].) 


[3] While
the parties appear to agree that Defendant had a contractual duty to defend
Plaintiff against the claims that alleged Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff’s
cause of action is based on the alleged duty to defend Plaintiff in the
underlying action in its entirety.  Thus,
the court cannot grant summary adjudication as to only a portion of Defendant’s
duty to defend that is undisputed by the parties.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (f)(1) [“A
motion for summary adjudication shall be granted only if it completely
disposes of . . . an issue of duty”] [emphasis added].)  The court further notes that, although Plaintiff
has requested that the court grant summary adjudication as to the issue of
breach of duty, that is an improper subject for summary
adjudication.  (Ibid. [a motion
for summary adjudication may be made only as to a cause of action, affirmative
defense, punitive damages, or issue of duty].)
