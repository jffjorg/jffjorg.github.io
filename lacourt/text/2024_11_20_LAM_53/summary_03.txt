And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by the plaintiff, Kristin Davidkhanian. The motions were to compel the defendants to respond to various discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, requests for production of documents, and requests for admissions.

The judge granted the motions to compel responses to the form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents, ordering the defendants to serve responses within 20 days of the date of service of the order.

The judge also granted the motion to deem the requests for admissions admitted, with the exception of requests 5-12, which the defendants had not responded to.

The judge ordered the defendants to pay monetary sanctions to the plaintiff in the total amount of $3,030, which includes $757.50 in sanctions for each of the motions.

The judge's ruling is a significant development in the case, as it requires the defendants to provide the plaintiff with the discovery responses she has requested, and also imposes monetary sanctions on the defendants for their failure to comply with the discovery requests.
