And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a summary adjudication motion filed by Scottsdale, the defendant, which alleges that the plaintiff's cause of action is based on the alleged duty to defend the plaintiff in the underlying action in its entirety. The judge notes that while the parties agree that Scottsdale had a contractual duty to defend the plaintiff against the claims that alleged Scottsdale's negligence, the plaintiff's cause of action is not limited to that specific duty. The judge therefore cannot grant summary adjudication as to only a portion of Scottsdale's duty to defend. Additionally, the judge notes that the plaintiff has requested summary adjudication on the issue of breach of duty, which is an improper subject for summary adjudication.
