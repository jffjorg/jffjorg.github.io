The court has tentatively ruled that the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint is sustained with leave to amend in all six causes of action. The court finds that the plaintiff's breach of express and implied warranty claims are deficient, as the plaintiff fails to state sufficient facts to support its claims. The court also finds that the plaintiff's claims for violation of Civil Code section 1793.2, the Tanner Consumer Protection Act, and strict liability – design defect are deficient, as the plaintiff fails to state sufficient facts to support its claims. The court sustains the demurrer to the fifth cause of action for negligent repair with leave to amend, as the plaintiff fails to state sufficient facts to support its claim. The court finds that the plaintiff's strict liability – design defect claim is deficient, as the plaintiff fails to state sufficient facts to support its claim.
