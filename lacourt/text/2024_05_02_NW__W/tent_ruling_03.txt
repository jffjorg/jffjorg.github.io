BACKGROUND
 
This is a lemon law action. Plaintiff
Khachatour C. Papazian filed a complaint against General Motors LLC and Cada De
Cadillac for 1. Breach of Express Warranty under the Song Beverly Consumer Warranty
Act; 2. Breach of Implied Warranty under the Song Beverly Consumer Warranty Act;
3. Violation of Business and Professions Code §17200; and 4. Negligent Repair.
On January 28, 2021, Plaintiff purchased from an authorized seller of Defendant
General Motors LLC a 2021 GMC Yukon. Plaintiff alleges shortly after taking
possession of the vehicle, Plaintiff experienced various defects that
substantially impair the use, value and/or safety of the vehicle and continues
to experience repeated problems with the subject vehicle. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Compliance
and for issue/evidentiary sanctions against Defendant General Motors LLC for
Failure to Comply with the February 22, 2024 Order and Request for $13,773.30
in Sanctions is GRANTED, in part. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiffs Khachatour C. Papazian and
Complete Total Care Inc.  move the court
for an order compelling compliance with the Court's February 22, 2024 discovery
order that directed GM to provide further responses and documents production in
response to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories (SROG No. 12-17, 23, 25-28,
37-42) and Request for Production of Documents (RPD No. 26-31, 34, 36-40). 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.010 provides that disobeying a court order to provide discovery is a
misuse of discovery. (CCP § 2023.010(g).) Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
128(a)(4) a court has the power to “compel obedience to its judgement, orders,
and process, and to the orders of a judge out of court, in an action or
proceeding pending therein.”   
 
On February 20, 2024, this court took
Plaintiff’s motions to compel further responses to Plaintiff’s Special
Interrogatories (Set One) and Request for Production of Documents (Set One)
under submission. On February 22, 2024, the court mailed the minute order,
which granted Plaintiff’s request for further responses but denied sanctions.
(Minute Order February 22, 2024.) Although the minute order did not state when
responses were due by, Plaintiff took this to be 30 days. (Yepremian ¶13.) As
of the date of this motion, however, Plaintiff has yet to receive any
responses. (Yepremian ¶13.) Plaintiff argues this is not an oversight by
Defendant but a pattern of gamesmanship. As such, in addition to compliance
with the February 22, 2024 Order, Plaintiff is seeking evidentiary and/or issue
sanctions. Specifically, it is requested that the Court enter a finding of
liability against GM on the issues of breach of the express/implied warranty
and a finding of civil penalty exposure and that a prove-up hearing on damages
be set at the court's convenience. Alternatively, Plaintiff seeks this court impose
evidentiary/issue sanctions with respect to the civil penalty issues. (See Mot.
p. 6:11-22.) Plaintiff also seeks sanctions against GM in the amount of
$4,861.65 each for the prior Motions to Compel Further Responses and an additional
$4,111.65 in preparing said Motion with a grand total of $13,773.30. 

The motion is unopposed. The court
GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel compliance. However, the court finds issue
and terminating sanctions are not warranted at this time. Discovery sanctions
must be tailored to the alleged discovery abuse and cannot be used to punish
the offending party. (Karlsson v. Ford Motor Co. (20 App.4th 1202, 1217
(“Discovery sanctions must be tailored in order to remedy the offending party's
discovery abuse, should not give the aggrieved party more than what it is
entitled to, and should not be used to punish the offending party”); Rail
Services of America v. State Comp. Ins. Fund (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 323, 332
(“A discovery sanction may not place the party seeking discovery in a better
position than it would have been in if the desired discovery had been provided
and had been favorable.”) Issuing issue or evidentiary sanctions based upon
Defendant’s failure to provide further responses after one motion to compel
further would violate such principles. 
 
The court, however, grants Plaintiff’s
request for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $2,250.00. The court
has already denied Plaintiff’s request for sanctions in bringing the motions to
compel further. Moreover, no opposition has been filed. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to
Compel Compliance and for issue/evidentiary sanctions against Defendant General
Motors LLC for Failure to Comply with the February 22, 2024 Order and Request
for $13,773.30 in Sanctions is GRANTED, in part.
