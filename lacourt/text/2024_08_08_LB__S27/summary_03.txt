Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by the defendants, Ford Motor Company and South Bay Ford Lincoln, and has issued a tentative ruling. The demurrer was filed in response to the plaintiff's complaint, which alleges fraudulent inducement and negligent repair. The defendants argued that the plaintiff's complaint is insufficient to state a claim for relief.

The court has ruled that the demurrer to the cause of action for fraudulent inducement by concealment is overruled. The court found that the plaintiff's amended allegations conform with the allegations found by the Court of Appeal to establish a relationship with the manufacturer sufficient to withstand demurrer.

However, the court has sustained the demurrer to the cause of action for negligent repair with leave to amend. The court found that the plaintiff failed to allege damages suffered as a result of any negligent repair. The court has ordered the plaintiff to file a First Amended Complaint within twenty days, and the defendants are ordered to file a responsive pleading within the statutory time thereafter.

The court has also ordered the parties to meet and confer in good faith before the defendants file a pleading challenging the First Amended Complaint. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit, and the parties who do not intend to submit must make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing.
