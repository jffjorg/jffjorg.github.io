Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants. The defendants demurred to the cause of action for fraudulent inducement-concealment and negligent repair. The court has determined that the plaintiff has adequately alleged a duty to disclose and that the tort of fraudulent inducement by concealment is excepted from the economic loss rules. However, the court has sustained the demurrer to the cause of action for negligent repair due to the plaintiff's failure to allege damages suffered as a result of any negligent repair. The court has ordered the plaintiff to file a first amended complaint within 20 days, and the defendants are ordered to file a responsive pleading within the statutory time thereafter. The parties must meet and confer in good faith before filing any pleading challenging the first amended complaint.
