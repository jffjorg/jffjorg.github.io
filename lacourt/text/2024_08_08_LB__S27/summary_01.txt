And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena. The motion was filed by Ralphs Grocery Company and The Kroger Co., who are defendants in a case brought by Lauren Watkins, who claims she suffered a slip and fall. The defendants seek to compel Watkins' friend, Jose Cruz Cisneros, to appear for a deposition. The motion was continued due to a lack of service on Cisneros, but the defendants have since provided proof of service. The judge has granted the motion to compel Cisneros' deposition, ordering him to appear within ten days. The defendants may unilaterally notice the deposition for a date, time, and location of their choosing, but must provide proper notice. The judge has denied the motion for evidentiary sanctions, finding them premature and only to be imposed if Cisneros violates a court order compelling his deposition. The case is scheduled for trial on September 23, 2024.
