Significant Statements:

  - "An oral contract may be pleaded generally as to its effect, because it is rarely possible to allege the exact words."
  - "The ABC test presumptively considers all workers to be employees, and permits workers to be classified as independent contractors only if the hiring business demonstrates that the worker in question satisfies each of three conditions."
  - "It is appropriate, and most consistent with the history and purpose of the suffer or permit to work standard in California's wage orders, to interpret that standard as: (1) placing the burden on the hiring entity to establish that the worker is an independent contractor who was not intended to be included within the wage order's coverage;[] and (2) requiring the hiring entity, in order to meet this burden, to establish each of the three factors embodied in the ABC test—namely (A) that the worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the work, both under the contract for the performance of the work and in fact; and (B) that the worker performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity's business; and (C) that the worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as the work performed."

Summary:
The court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Defendant Elita Era LLC dba Seal Skin Covers to a complaint filed by Plaintiff Michael Bank. The complaint alleges that the parties entered into an oral contract, and that Defendant failed to pay Plaintiff's earned commissions. The court has sustained the demurrer to the 1st cause of action (breach of contract) with leave to amend, and has overruled the demurrer to the 2nd cause of action (failure to pay wages in violation of Labor Code, § 201). The court has found that Plaintiff's allegations in paragraph 9 of the complaint are sufficient to allege that he was an employee of Defendant, and has accepted the truth of those allegations at the pleading stage.
