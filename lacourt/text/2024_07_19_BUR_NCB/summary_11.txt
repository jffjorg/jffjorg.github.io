Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered Defendant Tesla, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration against Plaintiff Jie Jiang. The Court finds that there is an enforceable agreement to arbitrate the claims asserted in the complaint, and that the scope of the arbitration provision is sufficiently broad to cover the claims in this action.

The Court has also considered Plaintiff's arguments that the arbitration agreement is procedurally and substantively unconscionable. However, the Court finds that the agreement is not procedurally unconscionable because it provides for an opportunity to opt out of the arbitration provision and because the agreement is not a contract of adhesion. The Court also finds that the agreement is not substantively unconscionable because it is not overly one-sided and because the cost provision is reasonable.

Based on the foregoing, the Court grants Defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stays the action pending the outcome of the arbitration. A Status Conference re: Status of Arbitration is set for January 15, 2025 at 8:30 a.m.
