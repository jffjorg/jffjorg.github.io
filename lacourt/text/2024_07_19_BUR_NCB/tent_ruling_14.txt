  Case No.:  24BBCV00455
 
Hearing
  Date:  July 19, 2024
 
 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motions to compel further responses 
 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations 
Plaintiff Lena Mestrandrea (“Plaintiff”)
alleges that on August 22, 2023 at approximately 1 P.M. at or near 4041 Whitset
Avenue in Studio City, she was attacked and bit by Defendant Nancy Ming Ling
Chen’s (“Defendant”) German Shepherd Mix dog. 
Plaintiff alleges that she was jogging past Defendant on a public street
when Defendant was unable to control her dog and, without warning or
provocation, the dog viciously attacked and bit Plaintiff.  
The complaint, filed February 23, 2024,
alleges causes of action for: (1) negligence; and (2) strict liability. 
B.    
Motion on Calendar 
On June 28, 2024,
Plaintiff filed 3 motions to compel Defendant’s further responses to: (1) Form
Interrogatories, set one (“FROG”); (2) Requests for Production of Documents,
set one (“RPD”); and (3) Requests for Admissions, set one (“RFA”).        
On July 8, 2024, Defendant filed
objections to the motions.  
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff moves to compel
Defendant’s further responses to FROG Nos. 2.2, 2.3, 2.5, 12.4, 16.3-16.5, and
17.1(b); RPD Nos. 17 and 18; and RFA Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10-13, 15, 17-19,
and 23-29. 
            Defendant filed objections to the
three motions, arguing that they were not timely served by electronic mail
pursuant to CCP §§ 1005(b) and 1010.6(a)(3)(B). 
Defendant argues that the motions were set for hearing on July 19, 2024,
but they were filed with the Court and served by electronic service on June 28,
2024.  To be timely, the motions were
required to be filed 16 court days before the hearing (or June 26, 2024) and
served at least 2 days prior to account for electronic service (or June 24,
2024).  Thus, Defendant states in her
objections that she will not address the merits of the motions or attend the
hearing in order that she not waive her objections.  
            As the motions were not timely filed
and served, the Court will continue the hearing on the motions to August 16,
2024 so that issues regarding service and the time to file substantive
opposition briefs are fully provided. 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Plaintiff Lena Mestrandrea’s three motions
to compel Defendant Nancy Ming Ling Chen’s further responses are continued to
August 16, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.  Defendant’s
opposition briefs and Plaintiff’s reply briefs shall be filed and served
pursuant to code based on the August 16, 2024 hearing date.  
Plaintiff shall
provide notice of this order.
