And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the pleadings in this case and has issued a tentative ruling. The defendant, Claudia Kelley, has filed a demurrer to the 3rd cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress and a motion to strike certain allegations in the complaint. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the allegations of extreme and outrageous conduct are sufficient to support a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.

The judge has granted the motion to strike the allegations for punitive damages, finding that the complaint does not adequately support a claim for punitive damages. The judge has also granted the motion to strike the allegations for attorney's fees, finding that the complaint does not adequately support a claim for attorney's fees.

The judge has given the parties 20 days to amend their pleadings to address the defects identified in this ruling.
