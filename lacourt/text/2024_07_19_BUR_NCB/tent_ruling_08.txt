 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motion to be relieved as counsel
 



 
Defense counsel, William D. Koehler, Esq.
(“Counsel”), moves to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Norton Sales, Inc.
(“Defendant”).  
Counsel filed this instant motion to be
relieved as counsel on June 13, 2024.  Counsel has filed the requisite forms pursuant
to CRC Rule 3.1362.  
According to the declaration of Counsel,
Counsel seeks to be relieved as counsel because Carlos Guzman, President of Norton
Sales, Inc., requested that Counsel filed this motion and Mr. Guzman has
consented to Counsel being relieved as counsel of record.  (MC-052, §2.)  Mr. Guzman also provides his declaration
stating that there are 3 pending actions stemming from a wrongful death lawsuit
to which his company had minimal involvement and his company can no longer
afford the financial burden or retaining Counsel.  (Guzman Decl., ¶¶2-3.)  He states his understanding that a
corporation cannot represent itself.  (Id.,
¶4.)  For these reasons, Counsel seeks to
withdraw from representing Defendant in this action.  
Counsel properly served Defendant at its
last known mailing address, which was confirmed by telephone and conversation within
the past 30 days of filing the motion.  
As for future hearing dates, a Status
Conference re: Private Mediation is set for September 12, 2024; a Final Status
Conference is set for October 31, 2024; and the Jury Trial is set for November
12, 2024.  Thus, there is sufficient time
for Defendant to obtain substitute counsel. 
Accordingly, the motion to be relieved as
counsel is granted.  The order electronically
lodged by Counsel will be signed at the hearing.  The order will become effective upon the
filing of a proof of service of a signed copy of the order on Defendant.  
In addition, as Defendant Norton Sales,
Inc. is a corporate entity, it cannot represent itself in propria persona.  (See Rogers
v. Municipal Court (1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 1314, 1318.)  Thus, the Court will set an Order to Show
Cause re Status of Representation of Defendant Norton Sales, Inc. for September
12, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. 
Notice to be provided by Counsel.
