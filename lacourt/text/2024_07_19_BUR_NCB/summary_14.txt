And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled that the plaintiff's motions to compel the defendant's further responses are continued to August 16, 2024, due to the untimely filing and service of the motions. The plaintiff filed the motions on June 28, 2024, but they were required to be filed 16 court days before the hearing, which was July 19, 2024. The defendant objected to the motions, arguing that she will not address the merits of the motions or attend the hearing in order to avoid waiving her objections. The Judge has scheduled a new hearing date for August 16, 2024, and has given the parties until that date to file and serve their opposition and reply briefs.
