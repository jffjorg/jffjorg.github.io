And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Kralik's tentative ruling grants the motion of defense counsel, William D. Koehler, Esq., to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Norton Sales, Inc. The motion was filed on June 13, 2024, and Counsel has properly served Defendant at its last known mailing address. The Court finds that there is sufficient time for Defendant to obtain substitute counsel, given the upcoming hearing dates. The Court notes that, as a corporate entity, Norton Sales, Inc. cannot represent itself in propria persona, and therefore sets an Order to Show Cause re Status of Representation of Defendant Norton Sales, Inc. for September 12, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. The order will become effective upon the filing of a proof of service of a signed copy of the order on Defendant.
