And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has declined to grant a stay of proceedings in this case, which involves a plaintiff who alleges childhood sexual assault by a teacher at a school district. The defendant school district has filed a motion to stay the proceedings, arguing that the Appellate Court's decision on the constitutionality of AB 218, which retroactively strips statutory government immunity from public entities, may render the case unactionable. The plaintiff has opposed the motion, arguing that the underlying orders in the appellate cases were in favor of the plaintiffs and that the defendant has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits.

The judge has considered the four factors for exercising discretion to impose a stay, including whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits, whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay, whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding, and where the public interest lies. The judge has concluded that staying the case would further delay the parties' ability to conduct discovery and depositions, and would prejudice the rights of the plaintiff and the other defendants. As a result, the judge has denied the motion for stay and allowed the case to proceed.
