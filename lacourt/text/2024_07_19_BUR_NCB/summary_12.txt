And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Abraham Abrahamian versus General Motors, LLC. The case involves a dispute over a warranty contract for a 2018 Chevrolet Camaro vehicle. The plaintiff, Abraham Abrahamian, alleges that the vehicle had defects and nonconformities during the warranty period and that the defendant failed to promptly replace the vehicle or make restitution. The defendant filed a demurrer and motion to strike portions of the complaint, but the plaintiff has since dismissed the 5th cause of action for fraudulent inducement and the prayer for punitive damages. As a result, the demurrer and motion to strike are taken off-calendar as moot. The court orders that the defendant provide notice of this ruling.
