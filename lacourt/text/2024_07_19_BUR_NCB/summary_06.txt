Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to attend a mental examination, subject to the parties entering into a protective order. The protective order will require that confidential test materials be released only to professionally qualified individuals, prohibit the parties from making copies of the materials, and seal the record to the extent any portion of the materials are disclosed in pleadings, testimony, exhibit, or other documents. The judge has also declined to award sanctions against the plaintiff and his counsel.
