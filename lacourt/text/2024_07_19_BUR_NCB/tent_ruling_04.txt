Trial
  Date:  July 19, 2024
 
 [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
Motion for statutory attorney’s fees  
 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations
Plaintiff Tommy Sabre Buttner
(“Plaintiff”) alleges that this matter involves the deceptive sale of a used,
unsafe, defective vehicle that was sold to Plaintiff by Defendant/dealer
Alternative Automotive Solutions, LLC (“Defendant”).  Plaintiff alleges that the vehicle was stolen
with a different VIN number so that when Plaintiff reported the issue to the
California Highway Patrol, the vehicle was taken away from Plaintiff,
impounded, and returned to the original owner even though Plaintiff had paid
the dealership in full and had no involvement in the illegal actions of
Defendant. 
The complaint, filed May 22, 2023, alleges
causes of action for: (1) violations of Consumers Legal Remedies Act (Civ.
Code, § 1750 et seq.); (2) conversion; (3) violations of Unfair
Competition Law (Bus. & Profs. Code, § 17200 et seq.); and (4) bond
liability. 
B.    
Relevant Background
This case proceeded to trial before the
Court on April 2, 2024.
The Court issued a Statement of Decision
on April 5, 2024.  The Court dismissed
the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th causes of action based
on Plaintiff’s failure to proceed at trial. 
The Court stated that Plaintiff would have judgment against Defendant in
the amount of $28,095 on the 1st cause of action.  
The Court entered Judgment on April 22,
2024.  The Judgment states that judgment
was entered in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of
$28,095.  Plaintiff may seek costs by
Memorandum of Costs and may seek statutory attorney’s fees by noticed
motion.  
C.    
Motion on Calendar 
On May 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion
for statutory attorney’s fees.
The Court is not in receipt of an
opposition brief. 
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff moves for attorney’s fees and costs after
trial in the amount of $21,705.  
            The
Court will continue the hearing on the motion for attorney’s fees.  The Court held a hearing on Defendant’s
motion for reconsideration, vacate or amend judgment, and new trial on June 28,
2024 and defense counsel presented a federal case that had not been cited in
its briefs.  The Court ordered that the
case be filed with the Court and took the matter under submission.  On July 2, 2024, the Court issued an order
giving Plaintiff until July 12, 2024 to file and serve a responsive brief to
Defendant’s oral arguments and the federal case provided.  On July 15, 2024, the Court denied
Defendant’s motion for reconsideration and caused the written order to be
served on defense counsel Gary Kast by mail on July 15, 2024.  
            In
light of the timing on the ruling and service of the order regarding the motion
for reconsideration, the Court will continue the
hearing on the motion for attorney’s fees in order to provide sufficient time
for the parties to file responsive briefs. 
The Court notes that Defendant did not file an opposition brief to the
motion for attorney’s fees (based on the original June 12, 2024 hearing date, the
opposition was due by June 28, 2024). 
The Court will give Defendant an opportunity to file an opposition brief
prior to the continued hearing date and an opportunity for Plaintiff to file a
reply brief. 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Plaintiff
Tommy Sabre Buttner’s motion for attorney’s fees is continued to August 16,
2024 at 8:30 a.m.  If Defendant intends
to oppose the motion for attorney’s fees, Defendant shall file and serve the
opposition by August 5, 2024. 
Plaintiff’s reply brief shall be filed and served by August 9,
2024.  
Plaintiff
shall provide notice of this order.
