Background
 
On September 14, 2023, Andreas
Jung (“Jung”) and Maribel Alvarenga (“Alvarenga”) (collectively “Plaintiffs”),
filed a Complaint against Adam Acosta, Jeffrey C. Bigelow (“Bigelow”); Manny
Corral (“M. Corral”); Diana Corral (“D. Corral”); Henry Gambill (“Gambill”)
(collectively “Defendants’); and Does 1 to 100. 
 
The Complaint alleges the
following ten causes of action: 
 
1)    
Breach of Contract (by Plaintiff Jung against
Defendant Acosta);
2)    
Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and
Fair Dealing (by Plaintiff Jung against Defendant Acosta);
3)    
Breach of Contract – Third Party Beneficiary (by
Plaintiff Alvarenga against Adam Acosta);
4)    
Conspiracy to Breach of Contract (against all
Defendants); 
5)    
Intentional Inference with Contract (Plaintiff
Junga against Defendants Bigelow, M. Corral, D. Corral, and Gambill.)
6)    
Intentional Interference with Economic Relations
(Plaintiff Alvarenga against all Defendants); 
7)    
Intentional Inference with Prospective Economic
Advantage (Plaintiff Alvarenga against all Defendants);
8)    
Fraud – Promise Made without Intention to
Perform (Plaintiff Jung against Defendant Acosta.) 
9)    
Fraud – Suppression of Fact Perform (Plaintiff
Jung against Defendant Acosta); and 
10) Conspiracy
to Commit Fraud (against all Defendants). 
 
On May 17, 2024, Plaintiff
dismissed the eighth, ninth, and tenth causes of action. 
 
On June 13, 2024, Defendants
Jeffrey C. Bigelow; Manuel Corral, Diana Corral, and Henry Gambill (hereinafter
“Defendants”) filed a Special Motion to Strike under CCP § 425.16. Defendant
Acosta filed a joiner to the Motion. After taking the matter under submission
on August 14, 2024, the court on August 19, 2024, granted Defendants’ special
motion to strike as to the fourth, sixth, and seventh causes of action and
denied the request to strike as to the fifth cause of action.
 
On August 28,
2024, Defendants filed a motion for attorney’s fees pursuant to CCP § 424.16(c).
Plaintiffs oppose the Motion. The matter is now before the court.  
 
motion for
attorney’s fees
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Pursuant to CCP § 425.16(c), a
prevailing defendant is entitled to recover attorneys’ fees and costs
associated with the motion. Under CRC 3.1702, a request for attorneys’ fees
must be made within 180¿days of service of the notice of entry of judgment or
“within the time for filing a notice of appeal under rules 8.104 and 8.108 in
an unlimited civil case[.]” A defendant may only recover fees and costs related
to the motion to strike. (Lafayette Morehouse, Inc. v. Chronicle Publishing
Co. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1383.) This includes fees associated with
bringing the motion for fees. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1141 (“an award of fees may include not only the fees incurred with respect to
the underlying claim, but also the fees incurred in enforcing the right to
mandatory fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16.”).) Additionally,
“[a]ny fee award must also include those incurred on appeal. [Citation.]” (Trapp
v. Naiman¿(2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 113, 122.)¿¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Discussion
 
Defendants seek $119,420 in
attorney’s fees and $1,470 costs as the prevailing party in an anti-SLAPP
motion. 
 
Defendants correctly assert that
they are the prevailing party because they eliminated all three causes of
action asserted by Plaintiff Alvarenga against Defendants and eliminated a
total of four out of the five claims asserted by Plaintiff Jung against
Defendants. The court denied the Anti-SLAPP only as to the fifth cause of
action for Intentional Inference with Contract. “We thus hold that a party who
partially prevails on an anti-SLAPP motion must generally be considered a
prevailing party unless the results of the motion were so insignificant that
the party did not achieve any practical benefit from bringing the motion. The
determination whether a party prevailed on an anti-SLAPP motion lies within the
broad discretion of a trial court.” (Mann v. Quality Old Time Service, Inc.
(2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 328, 340.) 
 
Plaintiffs do not deny that
Defendants are the prevailing party for purposes of the Anti-SLAPP motion.
However, Plaintiffs oppose the Motion on the basis that the hours billed and
the hourly rate of Defendants’ counsel are unreasonable. 
 
            A.        Reasonable Hourly Rate
 
“A trial court assessing attorney
fees begins with a touchstone or lodestar figure, based on the ‘careful
compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each
attorney ... involved in the presentation of the case.” (Christian Research
Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321 (Christian Research).)
“The reasonableness of attorney fees is within the discretion of the trial
court, to be determined from a consideration of such factors as the nature of
the litigation, the complexity of the issues, the experience and expertise of
counsel and the amount of time involved. The court may also consider whether
the amount requested is based upon unnecessary or duplicative work.” (Wilkerson
v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)¿ 
 
Defendants’ counsel, Joshua Adams
(“Adams”), requests an hourly rate in this matter of $700.00 per hour. (Adams
Decl., ¶ 17.) Adams graduated from law school in 2008 and has extensive
experience in labor and civil rights law. (Id., ¶¶ 5 10.) Plaintiffs assert
that Adams’ hourly rate is unreasonable under the Laffey Matrix. (Id., ¶
17, Ex. C.) Adams argues that in 2019, his hourly rate of $600.00 per hour was
approved in the case entitled Keaton v. Los Angeles Unified School District
(LASC Case No. BS165965). (Id., ¶ 18, Ex. D.) In 2020, his hourly rate
of $600.00 per hour was approved by Judge Rupert Byrdsong in the case entitled Anna
Yu, et al. v. David Ricardo Abud, et al. (LASC Case No. 19STCV42684.) 
 
Adams further asserts that in 2023
in the case entitled Boggs, et al. v. Southwest Gas Corp., et al. (San
Bernardino Sup. Ct. Case No. CIVDS1813554), the court approved his hourly rate
of $625.00 per hour. (Adams Decl., ¶ 20.) In 2023, Adams’ hourly rate of
$600.00 per hour was approved in the case entitled Plough, et al. v. She
Ball Productions, LLC, et al., (LASC Case No. BC696517). (Id.) 
 
Plaintiffs’ counsel asserts that
Defense counsel’s billing rate should be reduced to $450.00 per hour because
Plaintiffs’ counsel has 35 years of experience and has an hourly billing rate
is $450.00 per hour. (Lucas Decl., ¶ 21, Ex. 3.) Plaintiffs’ counsel also cites
other trial court cases in which the hourly rate of the attorneys was reduced.
(Id., ¶ 22.) 
 
The court is not persuaded that
Defense counsel’s hourly rate should be reduced simply because Plaintiffs’
counsel bills at a lower hourly rate despite more years of experience.
Moreover, Plaintiffs’ counsel fails to show why the court should use the hourly
fee billed by other counsel in other cases to determine the reasonableness of
Defense counsel’s hourly rate. 
 
Considering Adams’ expertise,
practice area, the complexity of the litigation, and the fact that courts have
previously found his hourly rate of $600.00 per hour reasonable, the court concludes
that an hourly billing rate of $600.00 per hour is a reasonable hourly rate for
Adams.  
 
For the reasons set forth above, the
court reduces Defense counsel’s hourly rate of $700.00 per hour to $600.00 per
hour.  
 
            B.         Reasonable Hours Spent Litigating the
Action
 
The burden is on the party seeking
attorney’s fees to prove that the fees it seeks are reasonable. (See Vines
v. O'Reilly Auto Enterprises, LLC (2022) 74 Cal.App.5th 174, 184.) But “
‘[i]n challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are
claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific
items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.
General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do
not suffice.’ ” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez¿(2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459,
488 citing Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. California
Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163¿Cal.App.4th¿550, 564.)¿“The anti-SLAPP
statute provides for an award of attorney fees and costs to the prevailing
defendant on a special motion to strike. (§ 425.16, subd. (c).) The defendant
may recover fees and costs only for the motion to strike, not the entire
litigation.” (Christian Research, supra, 165 Cal.App.4th at p.
1320.) 
 
In drafting, filing, and arguing the
Anti-SLAPP motion and request for attorney’s fees, Defendants request $119,420
in attorney’s fees for 170.6 hours of work. (Adams Decl., ¶ 17.) Defendants
assert that the anti-SLAPP motion presented complex issues including preemption
under the Labor
Management Relations Act, 1947, 29 U.S.C. § 185 (“LMRA”), mandatory disclosure
under the Labor Management Reporting & Disclosure Act of 1959 (“LMRDA”), 29
U.S.C. § 401, et seq, the applicability of the litigation privilege
under Civ. Code § 47, and the effect of violating the mediation privilege. In
preparation for the anti-SLAPP motion, the Adams also reviewed the full record
of the AFSCME International Judicial Panel, including the appeal. (Adams,
Decl., ¶ 13.) 
 
Adams asserts that after reviewing the billing entries for
accuracy and correctness and eliminating duplicative and erroneous billing
entries, he spent 161.6 hours on the Anti-SLAPP motion and 9.0 hours drafting
the motion or attorney’s fees. (Adams, Decl., ¶¶ 15, 17.) He
explains:   
 
Recognizing that
some duplication of effort may have occurred, and that some of the lawyers
involved were not experienced or knowledgeable in the relevant areas of law and
procedure, for the purposes of this attorneys’ fees motion I have discounted or
eliminated many of the hours that I have devoted to this litigation and
eliminated all other attorneys’ hours. I also have eliminated all
hours spent by my firm paralegals. In addition, I have exercised billing
judgment in cutting further my time spent on various tasks, eliminating all
conference time among attorneys, some work on preliminary matters to facilitate
communication among clients, duplicative time with associate attorneys
performing research, and any other time that seemed unnecessary, duplicative,
or inefficient.
(Id., ¶ 16 [italics original].) Defendants assert that
since retaining counsel “Defendants have served no discovery, they have not
responded to any discovery of Plaintiffs, and Defendants have filed no
responsive pleadings.” (Reply, at p. 2: 11-12.) Defendants also submitted a time
sheet showing the matters billed. (Adams Decl., ¶ 15, Ex. A.)
 
Plaintiffs assert that Adams billed for matters unrelated to
the anti-SLAPP such as reviewing the AFSCME Judicial Panel materials,
conferring with Defendants, reviewing the Complaint, conferring and drafting
stipulation to transfer venue, drafting relief from default judgment, and
reviewing Defendant Acosta’s demurrer. (See Lucas Decl., ¶ 16, Ex. 1.) Plaintiffs’
counsel further asserts Adams improperly used block billing, making it hard to
distinguish which billing entries are related to the anti-SLAPP and fully
compensable. “[T]rial courts are granted discretion ‘to penalize [block
billing] when the practice prevents them from discerning which tasks are
compensable and which are not.’ [Citation.]” (In re Marriage of Nassimi
(2016) 3Cal.App.5th 667, 695-696.) 
 
The court agrees that Adams’ fees should be reduced for block
billing as not all time entries appear to be related to the filing of the
Anti-SLAPP motion. However, the court finds that time spent reviewing the
ASFCME Judicial Panel proceedings was necessary to preparing the Anti-SLAPP
motion, as was reviewing Defendant Acosta’s demurrer as it goes to the merits
of Plaintiffs’ claims. Moreover, the court is not persuaded that Adams’ time
spent conferring with Defendants was conduct unrelated to the anti-SLAPP motion
and should not be compensated. 
 
Given these considerations, the court deducts the following
from the lodestar: 
 
·      
1.5
hours for: “Court hearing re: case management conference Phone - defendant
Jeffrey Bigelow re: demurrer, personal jurisdiction, anti-SLAPP motion”
·      
0.4 of
an hour for: “Draft proposed stipulation to opposing counsel; meet and confer
with co-defendant Acosta's legal counsel re: same”
·      
1.3
hours for: “Review correspondence and stipulated agreement among parties to
transfer venue and timeline for anti-SLAPP”
·      
1.3
hours for: “Review/respond to email re: transfer of case to new courthouse;
review court docket”
·      
0.3 of
an hour for: “Review filing; review/respond to emails re: same Review request
for relief from default judgment and opposition re: same; review supporting
declarations and materials”
·      
0.7
hours for: “Court hearing - Def Acosta motion for relief from default; multiple
calls with co-defendant counsel re: case status”
 
Accordingly, 5.5 hours billed at a rate of $600.00 per hour, or
$3,300.50, will be deducted from the lodestar. The court is not obligated to calculate
exactly how many hours of in the block billed time entries are compensable
under CCP § 425.16(c). (See Mountjoy v. Bank of America, N.A.
(2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 266, 280.) 
 
The court further agrees that hours billed by Adams are
excessive given the fact that Plaintiffs dismissed the eighth, ninth, and tenth
causes of action on May 17, 2024, but Defendants nevertheless briefed the issue
of whether Plaintiffs could prevail on the merits as to the tenth cause of
action. Therefore, the court will deduct 12 hours billed at a rate of $600.00 per
hour, or $7,200.00 from the lodestar. 
 
On July 29 and 30th, and August 1, 2024, Defendants also
block billed 16.3 hours for: “review opposition to anti-SLAPP motion; draft
reply brief and objections to evidence.” (Adams Decl., Ex. A.) The court notes
that the Plaintiffs filed no objections to Defendants’ evidence and Defendants filed
only one objection to the Plaintiffs’ evidence. Therefore, it seems excessive that
Defendants spent three days billing for a sole objection that was immaterial to
the Motion. The court deducts 6.0 hours billed at $600.00 per hour, or $3,600.00,
from the lodestar for this block billing.
 
Finally, the court must agree with Plaintiffs that 97.4 hours
spent on the fifteen-page opening motion, 16.3 hours on a ten-page reply brief,
and nine hours preparing a nine-page fees motion is excessive, particularly for
counsel with Adams’ experience. 
Moreover, although Defendants moved to strike five causes of action,
they prevailed only as to the fourth, sixth, and seventh.  
Accordingly, the court strikes another twenty-five hours from
Defendants’ request. 
 
In total, the court reduces the number of hours billed by
48.5 hours, and awards fees for 121.6 hours billed at $600 per hour, or $72,960.00.   
 
            C.        Costs
 
Defendants request $1,470.00 in costs related to the
anti-SLAPP motion. (Adams Decl., ¶ 15, Ex. B.) Plaintiffs assert that
Defendants are not entitled to costs because they seek to recover costs for the
entire litigation since its inception and not just the Anti-SLAPP. Plaintiffs
assert that Defendants Exhibit B “fails to provide the specificity necessary to
show what costs are even related to the anti-SLAPP motion and Defendants
provide no invoices.” (Opp. at p. 11:1-2.) 
 
The court agrees that Defense Exhibit B lists the costs and
description of services without specifying that the courtesy copies, filing
charge, access fee, and eFiling charge are all related to the Anti-SLAPP motion
and not another proceeding. Defendants’ reply fails to address Plaintiffs’
concerns. Defense counsel’s declaration also fails to assert that all charges
in Exhibit B have been audited to include only those costs related to the
filing of the anti-SLAPP motion. 
 
Absent a showing that Defendants’
costs were reasonably necessary to the filing of the anti-SLAPP motion, the
court agrees that Defendants should only be awarded $120.00 in costs for the
$60.00 filing fee associated with the anti-SLAPP motion and fee request motion.
Defendants may file a memorandum of costs if they wish to challenge the costs
awarded. 
 
The court awards Defendants
$120.00 in costs.
