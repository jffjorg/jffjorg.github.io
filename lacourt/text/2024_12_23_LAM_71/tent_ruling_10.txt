TENTATIVE RULING
 



MIN S

         vs.
 
MARK
  LEONARD, et al.


 Case No.: 
  24STCV15851
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 23, 2024



 
Plaintiff
Min S. Lee’s motion for this
Court to consolidate the Unlawful Detainer Action, Leonard v. Lee, LASC Case
No. 24STCV14625, with this action (Case No.: 24STCV15851), is denied.
Plaintiff’s
request in the alternative to stay the Unlawful Detainer Action is denied as
moot.
 
Plaintiff Min S. Lee (“Lee”) (“Plaintiff”) moves
to consolidate the instant matter with the Unlawful Detainer (“UD”) Action, Mark
Leonard v. Min S. Lee, LASC Case No. 24STCV14625, and to stay the UD.  (Notice Motion, pgs. 2; C.C.P. §§1048, 527,
1170.5.)  Plaintiff moves on the grounds
that the UD and instant, related civil action involve identical issues of fact
and law that should be resolved together to prevent inconsistent rulings,
conserve judicial resources, and protect Plaintiff’s due process rights.  (Notice Motion, pg. 2.)
Plaintiff also moves to stay the UD action for
lack of service, to continue the motion for summary judgment hearing, and
Preliminary and Permanent Injunction. 
(Notice Motion, pg. 2.)

Background
On June 11, 2025, Mark Leonard (“Leonard”) (“Moving
Defendant”) filed the related UD Action, Mark Leonard v. Min S. Lee,
LASC Case No. 24STCV14625.
On June 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed her operative
Complaint in this matter against numerous Defendants, including Leonard, alleging
twelve causes of action: (1) to set aside sale; (2) fraud; (3) constructive
fraud; (4) breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing; (5) breach of
contract; (6) quiet title; (7) violation of Civil Code §1671; (8) violation of
12 C.F.R. 1026.41; (9) violation of Business & Professions Code §§17200 et
seq; (10) accounting; (11) declaratory relief; and (12) injunctive relief.
On November 7, 2024, this Court entered
judgment on the UD Action in favor of Leonard and against Lee, after granting
summary judgment for Leonard.  (D-RJN,
Exh. C.)
Plaintiff filed the instant motion on October
3, 2024.  Defendant filed his opposition
on December 10, 2024.  As of the date of
this hearing no reply has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
C.C.P. §1048(a) provides: “When actions
involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may
order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the
actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders
concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.”  (C.C.P. §1048(a).)
“In
unlawful detainer proceedings, ordinarily the only triable issue is the right
to possession of the disputed premises, along with incidental damages resulting
from the unlawful detention. [Citations.] Ordinarily, issues respecting the
title to the property cannot be adjudicated in an unlawful detainer action. [Citations.]
The denial of certain procedural rights enjoyed by litigants in ordinary
actions is deemed necessary in order to prevent frustration of the summary
proceedings by the introduction of delays and extraneous issues. [Citations.].”  (Martin-Bragg v. Moore (2013) 219
Cal.App.4th 367, 385, internal citations omitted.)
“However,
the trial court has the power to consolidate an unlawful detainer proceeding
with a simultaneously pending action in which title to the property is in
issue. That is because a successful claim of title by the tenant would defeat
the landlord's right to possession. [Citation.] When an unlawful detainer
proceeding and an unlimited action concerning title to the property are
simultaneously pending, the trial court in which the unlimited action is
pending may stay the unlawful detainer action until the issue of title is
resolved in the unlimited action, or it may consolidate the actions. [Citation.]
If it does neither and instead tries the issue of title under the summary
procedures that constrain unlawful detainer proceedings, the parties’ right to
a full trial of the issue of title may be unfairly expedited and limited. If
complex issues of title are tried in the unlawful detainer proceeding, the
proceeding loses its summary character; defects in the plaintiff's title ‘are
neither properly raised in this summary proceeding for possession, nor are they
concluded by the judgment.’ [Citations.]” (Id.)
 
Discussion
Plaintiff’s motion to consolidate is denied.
As an
initial matter, Plaintiff’s appeal of the UD Action judgment divested this Court
of jurisdiction to make any order affecting the UD Action.  (D-RJN, Exh. B); People v. Espinosa
(2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1487, 1496 [“Generally, the filing of a notice of appeal
vests jurisdiction in the appellate court and divests the trial court of
jurisdiction to make any order affecting the judgment.”].)
Next,
Plaintiff was required to file the instant motion in the UD Action, both
because the UD Action is one of the cases sought to be consolidated and because
it is the lower-numbered case.  (CRC,
Rule 3.350(a)(1)(C), (a)(2)(A).) A review of the docket in the UD Action
reveals that the motion was not filed in that case.  Additionally, Plaintiff’s proof of service
shows the motion was not served on Donald Iwuchuku, Plaintiff’s counsel of
record in the UD Action.  (CRC, Rule 3.350(a)(2)(B)
[A motion to consolidate “[m]ust be served on all attorneys of record […] in
all of the cases sought to be consolidated […]”.].)
In
addition, consolidation of the two actions cannot happen as a matter of law,
since it would strip the prevailing plaintiff in the UD Action, Leonard, of accrued
rights (an enforceable judgment) and would act as a de facto order vacating or reversing
the judgment in the UD Action.  (Realty
Construction & Mortgage Co. v. Superior Court of San Joaquin County
(1913) 165 Cal. 543, 547-548 [consolidation should not be ordered when it will
diminish “the right[s] of the plaintiff [which] ha[ve] accrued.”].)
Also, consolidation
is not appropriate when one of the cases proposed to be consolidated is not
at-issue and there is no possibility that it will become at-issue. (Beaudreau
v. Allen (1951) 102 Cal.App.2d 552, 557 [denying consolidation when there
was “no showing that the Sanders’ action was or ever would be at issue . .
.”].)  Here, the post-judgment UD Action
is no longer at-issue because a judgment has been issued.  (D-RJN, Exh. C.)
And, the
UD Action is post-judgment and fully concluded. There is nothing to stay in
that case. To the extent Plaintiff is seeking a stay of the execution of the UD
Action judgment, the UD Action Court and the Appellate Court have already
denied Plaintiff’s requests for such relief.  (D-RJN, Exhs. D, E.)
Finally,
Plaintiff alternatively seeks a stay of the UD Action either under C.C.P. §1170.5
or by issuance of an injunction pursuant to C.C.P. §526, again based on the assertion
that the two actions involve common questions of law and fact.  (Motion at pgs. 5-6.)  However, there is nothing to stay because the
UD Action has concluded to judgment.  Plaintiff’s request in the alternative is
moot.
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s motion to consolidate is denied.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion to consolidate is denied. 
Moving Party to give notice.
