 Case No.: 
  24STCV18879
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 19, 2024



 
Defendants West
Coast Aerospace’s and Robert Vizcarra Paredes’ motion to strike portions of
Plaintiff Gregorio Ruiz’s complaint is granted with 20 days leave to
amend. 
 
Defendants West Coast Aerospace (“WCA”) and Robert Vizcarra
Paredes  (“Paredes”) (collectively, “Defendants”)
move to strike portions of Plaintiff Gregorio Ruiz’s (“Ruiz”) (“Plaintiff”)
Complaint pertaining to punitive damages, specifically: (1) ¶38; (2) ¶49; (3) ¶61;
(4) ¶70; (5) ¶81; (6) ¶86; (7) ¶94; (8) ¶102; (9) ¶112; and (10) Prayer ¶4 (“For
punitive damages, pursuant to Civil Code §§3294 in amounts sufficient to punish
Defendants for the wrongful conduct alleged herein and to deter such conduct in
the future.”).  (Notice of MTS, pgs. 1-2;
C.C.P. §§435-437, 431.10; Civ. Code §3294.)
 
Meet and Confer
Before filing a motion to strike, the moving party must
meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the
party who filed the pleading to attempt to reach an agreement that would
resolve the objections to the pleading and obviate the need for filing the motion.
 (C.C.P. §435.5(a).)
The moving party shall file and serve with the motion to
strike a declaration stating either of the following: (A) The means by which
the moving party met and conferred with the party who filed the pleading
subject to motion, and that the parties did not reach an agreement resolving
the objections raised in the motion to strike. (B) That the party who filed the
pleading subject to motion failed to respond to the meet and confer request of
the demurring party or otherwise failed to meet and confer in good faith.  (C.C.P. §435.41(a)(3).)
Defendants’ counsel declares that on October 16, 2024, he
attempted to met and conferred telephonically with Plaintiff’s counsel, and the
parties were unable to reach an agreement, necessitating the instant motion.  (Decl. of Hirota ¶3.)  Defendants’ counsel’s declaration is
sufficient under C.C.P. §435.41(a). 
Therefore, the Court will consider Defendants’ motion to strike.

Legal Standard
C.C.P. §436 provides that the Court may, upon a motion made
pursuant to C.C.P. §435, or at any time within its discretion and upon terms it
deems proper, “strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in
any pleading” or any pleading or part thereof “not drawn or filed in conformity
with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.”  (C.C.P. §436.)
 
Summary of Motion
Defendants move to strike portions of the Complaint pertaining to
recovery of punitive damages.  (Motion,
pgs. 6-13.)
 
Punitive Damages
Punitive damages may be
recovered upon a proper showing of malice, fraud, or oppression.  (Civ. Code §3294(a).)  “Malice” is defined as conduct intended to
cause injury to a person or despicable conduct carried on with a willful and
conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others.  (Turman v. Turning Point of Cent. Cal.,
Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.) 
“Oppression” means despicable conduct subjecting a person to cruel and
unjust hardship, in conscious disregard of the person’s rights.  (Id.) 
“Fraud” is an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a
material fact known by defendant, with intent to deprive a person of property,
rights or otherwise cause injury.  (Id.)  Conclusory allegations, devoid of any factual
assertions, are insufficient to support a conclusion that parties acted with
oppression, fraud, or malice.  (Smith
v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1042.)
“Conduct which warrants punitive damages must be of ‘such severity
or shocking character [as] warrants the same treatment as accorded to willful
misconduct – conduct in which defendant intends to cause harm.’”  (Woolstrum v. Mailloux (1983) 141
Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 10, quoting Nolin v. National Convenience Stores, Inc.
(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 279, 286.)  “Despicable
Conduct” is conduct that is so vile, base, contemptible, miserable, wretched or
loathsome that it would be looked down upon and despised by ordinary decent
people.”  (Scott v. Phoenix
Schools, Inc. (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 702, 715.)
          Plaintiff fails to
sufficiently allege malice in his causes of action to support his request for
punitive damages.  While heavy with conclusory
language, Plaintiff’s allegations fail to allege specific facts demonstrating
an intent to cause injury to Plaintiff or despicable conduct with the willful
and conscious disregard of the rights safety of others.  Further, Plaintiff does not sufficiently allege
fraud based on the allegations of “false assurances” that Defendants allegedly provided
to Plaintiff.  Such allegations are not
alleged with the requisite specificity. 
Accordingly, Moving Defendants’ motion to strike Plaintiff’s
request for punitive damages from the Complaint is granted with 20 days
leave to amend.  
 
Conclusion
Defendants’ motion to strike is granted with 20 days leave
to amend.
Moving Party to give notice.
