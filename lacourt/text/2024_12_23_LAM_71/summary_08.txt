The Plaintiff, The Woman's Club of Hollywood, California, has filed a motion for relief under California Code of Civil Procedure sections 473(b) and 2033.280(a)(1), (2). The Judge has denied the motion. The Judge found that the Plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the admission was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and that no substantial prejudice would result from allowing the admission to be withdrawn or amended. The Judge also found that the Plaintiff's predicament was caused, at least in part, by its own misconduct, including its failure to cooperate with counsel. The Judge noted that the Plaintiff's counsel's actions were a result of tactical decisions and the Plaintiff's unwillingness to cooperate with counsel. The Judge ruled that the Plaintiff's motion was denied and that the Plaintiff should give notice.
