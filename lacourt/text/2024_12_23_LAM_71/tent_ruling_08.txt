         vs.
 
SARA
  VAN HORN, et al. 


 Case No.: 
  23STUD11101
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 23, 2024



 
Plaintiff
The Woman’s Club of Hollywood, California’s motion for
relief pursuant to C.C.P. §§473(b) and 2033.280(a)(1), (2) is denied.
 
Plaintiff
The Woman’s Club of Hollywood, California (“TWCHC”) (“Plaintiff”), bring a motion
for relief pursuant to C.C.P. §§473(b) and 2033.280(a)(1), (2).  (Notice of Motion, pg. 1; C.C.P. §§473(b), 2033.280(a)(1),
(2).)
 
          Legal Standard
          C.C.P. §2033.300 provides:
(a)  A party may withdraw or
amend an admission made in response to a request for admission only on leave of
court granted after notice to all parties.
 
(b)  The court may permit
withdrawal or amendment of an admission only if it determines that the
admission was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and
that the party who obtained the admission will not be substantially prejudiced
in maintaining that party’s action or defense on the merits.
(c)  The court may impose
conditions on the granting of the motion that are just, including, but not
limited to, the following:
 
(1)   An order that the party who obtained
the admission be permitted to pursue additional discovery related to the matter
involved in the withdrawn or amended admission.
 
(2)   An order that the costs of
any additional discovery be borne in whole or in part by the party withdrawing
or amending the admission.
 
(C.C.P.
§2033.300, emphasis added.)
          C.C.P. §2033.300(a) permits amendment
or withdrawal of “deemed admissions” ordered by the court under §2033.280(b),
as well as admissions expressly made by a party.  (Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th
973, 979.)
 
Discussion
          Plaintiff
fails to move for relief under the operative statute, namely C.C.P. §2033.300.  Plaintiff’s motion moves for relief under C.C.P.
§§473(b) and 2033.280(a)(1), (2).  Plaintiff’s
motion cannot be granted under C.C.P. §§473 or 2033.280.
          As a preliminary matter, Plaintiff’s
argument in its reply that Demyer v. Costa Mesa Mobile Home Estates
(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 393 was overturned by Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999)
21 Cal.4th 973 is a misstatement of the law. 
Wilcox disapproves portions of Demyer pertaining to whether
withdrawal or amendment of an RFA is permissible if no response has been
provided; it did not rule on whether C.C.P. §473 is available. “The law
governing the consequences for failing to respond to requests for admission may
be the most unforgiving in civil procedure. There is no relief under section
473.”  (Demyer, 36 Cal.App.4th
at pg. 395, disapproved on other grounds by Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999)
21 Cal.4th 973, emphasis added.) 
Under C.C.P. §2033.300(b), a party will be
permitted to withdraw or amend an admission only if the court finds: (1)
the admission resulted from “mistake, inadvertence or excusable neglect” (e.g.,
new facts discovered contradicting earlier admission); and (2) No
substantial prejudice to the requesting party will result from allowing the
admission to be withdrawn or amended. 
(C.C.P. §2033.300(b); see New Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court
(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1418.)  On
the other hand, the court's discretion to deny a motion to withdraw or
amend is limited to circumstances where it is clear that the mistake,
inadvertence, or neglect was inexcusable, or where it is clear that the
withdrawal or amendment would substantially prejudice the party who obtained
the admission in maintaining that party's action or defense on the merits. (Id.,
at 1420-1421.)  
Here, Plaintiff fails to demonstrate either
that there was excusable mistake, inadvertence, or neglect,
or that no substantial prejudice will result from allowing the admission to be
withdrawn or amended.  The evidence
presented by Plaintiff indicates that Plaintiff’s counsel served unverified responses
to the requests for admission on September 22, 2023, then sent improper verifications
on October 4, 2023.  Defendant filed a
motion to deem the facts contained in the requests admitted on October 11,
2023, which was set to be heard on March 4, 2024.  Rather than remedying the improper
verification, Plaintiff’s counsel filed an opposition, incorrectly arguing that
Defendant needed to have met and conferred and filed a motion for further
responses prior to moving to deem the facts contained in the requests admitted.  Plaintiff’s counsel then moved to withdraw, and
then moved ex parte to advance the hearing on that motion to withdraw to March
4, 2024.  On March 4, 2024, the facts
contained in the requests were deemed admitted and Plaintiff’s counsel was
granted leave to withdraw from her representation of Plaintiff.
The evidence presented by Plaintiff in its
moving papers suggests this outcome was a result of Plaintiff’s counsel’s tactical
decisions and Plaintiff’s unwillingness to cooperate with (including not paying)
counsel (See Exhibit 2 to the moving papers). 

Plaintiff argues, essentially, that it
should not be punished for its counsel’s misdeeds.  Nonetheless, a party who seeks relief under
section 473 on the grounds of mistake or inadvertence of counsel generally must
demonstrate that such mistake, inadvertence, or general neglect was excusable because
the negligence of the attorney . . . is imputed to his client and may not
be offered by the latter as a basis for relief. 
“The client's redress for inexcusable neglect by counsel is, of course,
an action for malpractice.” ( Martin v. Cook (1977)
68 Cal.App.3d 799, 809; Orange Empire Nat. Bank v. Kirk (1968)
259 Cal.App.2d 347, 353.)  
Moreover, while an attorney's positive
misconduct may be except a claim for relief from this general rule, the
exception depends on the person seeking relief being relatively free from negligence.  (Carroll v. Abbott Laboratories, Inc. (1982)
32 Cal.3d 892, 898.)  Here, Plaintiff’s
predicament appears to be caused, at least in part, from Plaintiff’s own misconduct,
namely, its failure to cooperate with counsel. 

Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion is denied. 
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff
The Woman’s Club of Hollywood, California’s motion for relief pursuant to
C.C.P. §§473(b) and 2033.280(a)(1), (2) is denied.
Moving Party to give notice.
