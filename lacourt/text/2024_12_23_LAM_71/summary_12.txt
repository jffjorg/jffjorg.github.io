Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint seeking punitive damages. The plaintiff had alleged that the defendants had engaged in despicable conduct, including making false assurances, but the judge found that these allegations were insufficient to support a claim of malice, fraud, or oppression. The judge ruled that the plaintiff failed to sufficiently allege specific facts demonstrating an intent to cause injury or despicable conduct with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights and safety of others. As a result, the judge granted the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's request for punitive damages, but allowed the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint.
