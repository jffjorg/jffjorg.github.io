And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a premises liability and negligence claim brought by Adam Dolewski against Dollar Tree Stores, Inc., Berkshire Bakersfield, LLC, and Brentwood Group, LLC. The case arose from an incident in which Dolewski was confined in a freezer for a substantial period of time and alleges that the defendants' negligence caused his injuries and damages.

The defendants have renewed their motion to require Dolewski to answer questions about his past drug use and drug use history at his deposition. The defendants argue that their retention of an expert, Dr. James Pratty, who has reviewed Dolewski's medical records, constitutes new and different facts that support their motion. Dr. Pratty opines that long-term drug use affects sensory perception and decision-making ability, which could have contributed to the incident.

The Judge has granted the renewed motion, finding that new and different facts exist that support reconsideration of the prior order. The Judge is swayed by Dr. Pratty's opinions and finds in favor of the defendants. The defendants are ordered to give notice, and parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court.
