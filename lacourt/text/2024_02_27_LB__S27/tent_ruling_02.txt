 Case Number:  22LBCV01049    Hearing Date:   February 27, 2024    Dept:  S27 Plaintiff, Kae Kwon filed this
action against Defendant, Intercommunity Care Centers, Inc. for damages arising
out of assault, battery, and related claims. 
Plaintiff filed the action on 12/23/22. 
On 5/22/23, the Court held a Case Management Conference.  Plaintiff had not yet served Defendant with the
summons and complaint.  Neither party
appeared.  The Court set an OSC re:
Sanctions, including dismissal, for 6/14/23. 
On 6/14/23, no party appeared, and the Court dismissed the action.  
 
On 12/18/23, Plaintiff filed this
motion to vacate the dismissal, contending it was entered as a result of
Plaintiff’s attorney’s mistake or neglect. 
The hearing was originally set for 1/02/24 in Department S26.  Prior to the hearing, Defendant filed a
preemptory challenge against Judge Vicencia, and the case was reassigned to
Department S27.  The hearing was rescheduled
for 2/27/24.  On 2/13/24, Defendant filed
opposition to the motion, correctly noting that the moving papers were filed
more than six months after the dismissal was entered, such that they were not
timely pursuant to CCP §473(b).
 
Despite the lack of timely filed
papers, the Court is vacating the dismissal. 
This is because the dismissal was entered without any statutory or other
authority for dismissing the action.  CCP
§583.420(a)(1) permits the Court to dismiss an action if the summons and
complaint are not served within two years after the action is filed.  §583.410 also permits the Court to dismiss an
action if the case is not brought to trial within two years after filing.  There are various other statutes that permit
dismissal of an action, none of which apply here.  Pursuant to Lyons v. Wickhorst (1986) 42
Cal.3d 911, 915-917, the Court’s powers to dismiss absent a statutory basis are
extremely limited, and can only be applied in sham actions or where a delay of
less than the statutory period has been prejudicial to the other party.  
 
Because the
dismissal was entered without statutory or other basis, it is void and the Court
vacates the dismissal.  The Court sets a
Case Management Conference and Trial Setting Conference in one month, for
Wednesday, 3/27/24 at 8:30 a.m. in this department.  

 
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice.
