And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling vacates the dismissal of the case filed by Kae Kwon against Intercommunity Care Centers, Inc. The case was dismissed on June 14, 2023, without any statutory basis for dismissal. The judge finds that the powers to dismiss an action are extremely limited and can only be applied in sham actions or where a delay of less than the statutory period has been prejudicial to the other party. Since the dismissal was entered without statutory basis, it is void and the judge vacates the dismissal. The case will be set for a Case Management Conference and Trial Setting Conference on March 27, 2024.
