And here is the English text summary:

This Tentative Ruling addresses a motion to compel deposition and recover sanctions filed by the defendants in a slip and fall case. The plaintiff failed to appear at a properly noticed deposition and has not responded to attempts to reschedule. The defendants applied ex parte to advance the hearing on the motion from April 30, 2024 to February 27, 2024. The court granted the application, but the motion is still scheduled for hearing in violation of CCP §2024.020, which requires motions concerning discovery to be heard on or before the 15th day before the trial date. The court denies the motion and orders the defendants to give notice. Parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to do so.
