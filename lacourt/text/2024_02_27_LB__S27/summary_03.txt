And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses four discovery motions in a lemon law case. The motions are: (1) to compel deposition of PMK, (2) to compel vehicle inspection, (3) to compel deposition, and (4) to compel further responses. The judge is concerned about the increasing number of these motions and the lack of cooperation between the parties. The judge has ruled on similar motions in previous cases and is inclined to continue the hearing for one month to require the parties to meet and confer in good faith. The judge also emphasizes the importance of resolving issues through meet and confer, rather than through motions and hearings. If the parties are unable to resolve their issues, they must file a joint statement and briefs and declarations. The judge may impose sanctions if necessary.
