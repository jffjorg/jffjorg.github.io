The Court finds that the parties' separate statements are insufficient and orders them to revise their statements to include only material facts. The Court also orders supplemental briefing on additional issues, including whether the motion for summary adjudication constitutes an election of remedy and whether the Court should appoint an accounting referee. The hearing on the motion for summary adjudication is continued to May 6, 2024.
