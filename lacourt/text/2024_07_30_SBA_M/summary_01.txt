And here is the English-text summary:

Judge Gary Y. Tanaka has issued a tentative ruling denying Alfonzo Sanchez Loya's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint without prejudice. The motion seeks to add a cause of action for fraud and punitive damages against Ford Motor Company. The court found that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient information about when the facts giving rise to the amendment were discovered and why the request for amendment was not made earlier. The court also noted that the plaintiff did not specify any allegations that were deleted from the original complaint. The judge ruled that the motion for leave to amend is denied without prejudice, and the plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
