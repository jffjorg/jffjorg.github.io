Roles:
  - Judge: The judge is considering the defendant's motion for summary judgment or adjudication and has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion.
Significant Statements:
  - "The court disagrees with CUSD's argument that it did not have a duty to supervise Doe."
  - "The court finds that a triable issue of fact exists with regard to whether CUSD's staff exercised due care in supervising Doe when Wilborn was touching Doe's back and thigh in class."
  - "The court disagrees with CUSD's contention that Doe's first cause of action for IIED fails because CUSD cannot be held vicariously liable for Wilborn's conduct."
