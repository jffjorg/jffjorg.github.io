And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to file a Second Amended Complaint. The plaintiff, Yonghong Li, seeks to add new causes of action for wrongful death and negligent hiring, supervision, and retention to the complaint. The judge has previously sustained demurrers to the plaintiff's original complaint and first amended complaint, and has found that the plaintiff failed to allege how the defendants owed a duty to the plaintiff in those complaints. The judge has also found that the plaintiff's proposed Second Amended Complaint fails to address the grounds upon which the court previously denied leave to amend. Therefore, the judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to file the Second Amended Complaint.
