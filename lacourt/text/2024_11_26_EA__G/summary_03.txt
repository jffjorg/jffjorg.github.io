And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Plaintiff Blue Wave Properties, LLC's ex parte application for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and set an Order to Show Cause (OSC) re: Preliminary Injunction for December 6, 2024. The TRO prohibits Defendant Eric Reusch from allowing acts that constitute a nuisance to other business owners, such as prostitution, illegal drug sales, and illegal gambling, at the subject premises. The court finds exigent circumstances to support Plaintiff's request for ex parte relief, citing the declarations of Ms. Wolff and Mr. Echavarria which establish that the property is a "shopping center...with sixteen tenants" and that Defendant Reusch's failure to curb illegal activity has "fostered a hub for criminal activity". The court sets a briefing schedule for December 4 and 5, 2024, and orders Plaintiff to serve the OSC re: Preliminary Injunction on Defendant not later than November 30, 2024. Failure to do so will result in denial of the Preliminary Injunction.
