SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
March 11, 2021, Plaintiffs Ricardo and Olga Heredia filed a “lemon law”
complaint regarding their 2016 Chevy Malibu vehicle. On July 19, 2023,
Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement of the entire case.
 
RULING: Granted.
Evidentiary
Objections: Overruled.
 
Request
for Judicial Notice: Granted.
The
court takes notice of the existence of other court orders, but declines to take
notice for the truth of any matter asserted in any and all items. (Kilroy v. State of California (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 140, 147-148; Sosinsky v. Grant (1992) 6
Cal.App.4th 1548, 1565.) The orders also constitute unpublished material, and
therefore not citable for any reference. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.1115(a); Rittiman v. Public Utilities Com. (2022) 80 Cal.App.5th 1018, 1043 (footnote 18).) 
 
Plaintiffs Ricardo and Olga Heredia move for $51,351.75
in attorney fees. Defendant General Motors, LLC (GM) in opposition challenges
the motion on grounds of excessive attorney fees and lack of any justification
for a multiplier. Plaintiffs in reply acknowledges the lack of any opposition
to the entitlement of fees, and reiterates the reasonableness of all entries as
well as entitlement to a multiplier enhancement. Plaintiff also extensively
challenges the objections of GM to the time entries. 
 
The
entitlement to fees pursuant to the statute is undisputed. Plaintiffs are also
presumed prevailing parties for purposes of statutory recovery. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1032, subd.
(a)(4); 1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(B); Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d).) The 998
offer led to an $40,000 repurchase, with attorney fees to be determined via
noticed motion before the court. [Declaration of Tionna Carvalho., ¶ 39, Ex.
4.] 
 
The accepted offer specifically
delegated determination of fees to the court, thereby entitling Plaintiffs to
bring the subject motion. (Engle v. Copenbarger & Copenbarger, LLP (2007)
157 Cal.App.4th 165, 168–169.) As a prevailing party, Plaintiffs are entitled
to recover post-offer costs as well. The court finds the provisions of Code of
Civil Procedure section 998 not applicable, as the action settled rather than
going to trial and leading to judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 998, subd. (e).) Nothing in the opposition to
the motion otherwise establishes any right to a fee cut-off subsequent to the
time of the offer, due to Defendant obtaining a better result via judgment. (Scott Co. of California v.
Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103, 1114; Duale v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
718, 726; see Dominguez v. American Suzuki
Motor Corp. (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 53, 60; Ellis Law Group, LLP v.
Nevada City Sugar Loaf Properties, LLC (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 244, 248.)
 
Plaintiffs have “the burden of showing that the fees incurred [are] “’allowable,’
[are] ‘reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation,’ and [are] ‘reasonable
in amount.’” (Levy v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (1992) 4
Cal.App.4th 807, 816; Morris v. Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41
Cal.App.5th 24, 34.) The statute “requires the
trial court to make an initial determination of the actual time expended; and
then to ascertain whether under all the circumstances of the case the amount of
actual time expended and the monetary charge being made for the time expended
are reasonable. These circumstances may include, but are not limited to,
factors such as the complexity of the case and procedural demands, the skill
exhibited and the results achieved. If the time expended or the monetary charge
being made for the time expended are not reasonable under all the
circumstances, then the court must take this into account and award attorney
fees in a lesser amount.” (Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31
Cal.App.4th 99, 104.) The lodestar method for
determination of fees applies. (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California, Inc. (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 785, 819.)
 
“‘[T]he lodestar
is the basic fee for comparable legal services in the community; it may be
adjusted by the court based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the
novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in
presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded
other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.
[Citation.] The purpose of such adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair market
value for the particular action. In effect, the court determines, retrospectively,
whether the litigation involved a contingent risk or required extraordinary
legal skill justifying augmentation of the unadorned lodestar in order to
approximate the fair market rate for such services.’” (Graciano v.
Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144
Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)
 
The reasonableness of attorney fees lies within the
discretion of the trial court. (PLCM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1096.) The court makes it
determination based on the consideration of a number of factors, including,
“the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill
required in its handling, the skill employed, the attention given, the success
or failure, and other circumstances in the case.” (Ibid.) The court should apply an objective standard of
reasonableness. (Id. at p. 1098.) “A
fee request that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance
permitting the trial court to reduce the award or deny one altogether.” (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d
621, 635.) The court adheres to the “market
rate” approach for contingency cases, and finds the “Laffey” charts general and
only suggestive. (Pasternack v. McCullough (2021) 65 Cal.App.5th 1050, 1057; Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010)
188 Cal.App.4th 603, 619-620.)
 
Counsel
lists billable rates between $290 to $595 per hour over 75.40 hours for a total
of $34,538.50, plus an additional $3,500 for the subject motion. [Declaration
of Payman Shahian, ¶ 73, Ex. 18.] Plaintiff seeks a 1.35 times multiplier
applied to the $34,538.50 base for an additional $12,088.48, as well as
$1,224.77 in costs. [Id., ¶¶ 74-75.]
 
GM in opposition opens with a
counteroffer of $9,782.50, a recovery with no multiplier enhancement, based on
a challenge to the reasonableness of the fees given the straightforward,
routine nature of the action and experience of counsel. GM also contends no
entitlement to recovery of any costs. 
 
GM otherwise offers no particular
argument to the range of hourly rates, but in arguing for a reduction of fees
GM effectively agrees to a collective hourly rate close to the requested
amount: GM moves for a reduction of $24,756 based on the reduction of 55.7
hours, which approximates $445/hour, while the $34,538.50 in sought
after fees divided by 75.40 hours equals approximately $458/hour. (The request
for $3,500 in fees associated lists 8.2 hours at $375/hour by Zavig Mkrdech for
a listed total of $3,075.) The court finds a collective rate of $450/hour
reasonable. 
 
The
subject action was taken on a contingency basis, with statutory recovery a
condition of prevailing on the action. Song-Beverly litigation constitutes a
specialty, due to the extensive statutory guidelines and technical requirements
in analyzing a vehicle. While the court cannot take notice of other courts
approved billable rates, the court finds the collective billing represents a
reasonable range of rates and blended rate structure. (Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of North America, LLC (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 240, 247, 256; Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino,
supra, 188 Cal.App.4th at pp. 619-620; see Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. of Phila. v. American Radiator &
Standard Sanitary Corp. (3d Cir. 1973) 487 F.2d 161, 167.)
 
The court
next considers the listed entries. “In referring
to ‘reasonable’
compensation, we indicated that trial courts must carefully review attorney documentation
of hours expended; ‘padding’ in the form of inefficient or duplicative efforts
is not subject to compensation.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132; Levy v. Toyota Motor Sales,
U.S.A., Inc., supra, 4
Cal.App.4th at p. 817.) 
 
The court
finds no documented examples of unrelated work leading to the settlement, or
redundant billing on items. (Donahue v. Donahue (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 259,
271.) Plaintiff in reply emphasizes the lack of redundant billing or block
billing . GM cites to no particularly unnecessary items as an entry in an of
itself, and instead focuses on the reasonableness of hours listed for said
tasks. (See Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of North
America, LLC, supra, 48 Cal.App.5th
at pp. 255-256.) The court considers the individual contributions of each
attorney rather engage in a categorical determination of entitlement. (Morris v. Hyundai Motor America
(2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 40; Mountjoy v. Bank of America, N.A. (2016) 245
Cal.App.4th 266, 280-281; Christian Research Institute v. Alnor, supra,
165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1329.) 
 
The court
begins with the first entry—the complaint. The fee log lacks any entry for the
drafting of the complaint itself. Thus, assuming a form complaint, the court
finds the time spent revising, finalizing and incorporating supporting
documents regarding the subject parties and vehicle over a period of 1.2 hour
remains a justifiable entry. The court however finds the discovery entries,
when considered in total from October 13, 2021, October 15, 2021, October 18,
2021, November 22, 2021, November 23, 2021, November 24, 2021, and November 30,
2021, for a total of 15.4 hours lacking any specific support in the declaration
of moving counsel, including even a basic description of the discovery
conducted. [See Declaration of Ryan Kay, ¶ 5, Ex. C.] The responses to
discovery indicate boilerplate objections. [See Id., ¶ 9, Ex. G.] The court
finds 8.1 hours for routine admissions, interrogatories and document production
utilized by an experienced consumer/lemon law litigation firm, and 7.3 hours
for objections lacking support. The court deducts 10 hours from this set, and
reduces the total to 5.4 recoverable hours. 
 
The court
also finds the hours spent on the motion to compel the PMQ deposition
excessive. The list shows entries on December 23, 2022, December 29, 2022,
January 3, 2023, February 17, 2023, February 21, 2023, February 28, 2023, and
March 27, 2023, for a total of 30 hours. The court conducted an Independent
Discovery Conference, which led to a stipulated agreement for the deposition by
a certain cutoff date. Nothing in the motion presented complicated subject
matter, other than the scope of the deposition questions, and was apparently
resolved following the IDC. The court therefore deducts 15 hours from this set
of items, which includes recovery for motion prep and IDC appearance time. On
the subject motion for recovery attorney fees and costs, the court reduces the
sought after time spent to five (5) hours from the 7.2 hours listed, plus an
additional three (3) hours for any reply and appearance for a total of eight
(8) hours. The court declines to consider the declaration in reply from Dhara
Patel requesting nine (9) hours of billing time just for the reply to the
subject motion, especially given the prior entry by separate counsel, and the
courts own determination of the reasonableness of the fee.
 
The court
therefore deducts 25 hours from the 75.40 listed, adds in 0.8 hours into the
instant motion for recovery of fees, leading to a total of 51.2 hours. Given
the hours on the attorney fee motion only appeared billed at $375/hour by Zavig
Mkrdech, the court therefore adheres to this for this particular item only, which
equals $3,000. On the 43.2 remaining hours, the court multiplies the recovery
by the collective rate of $450/hour for a total of $19,440. The combined amount
adds up to $22,440.
 
The court declines to award a
multiplier on the subject action. “The lodestar
amount is presumptively the reasonable fee amount, and thus a multiplier may be
used to adjust the lodestar amount upward or downward only in “ ‘rare’ and
‘exceptional’ cases, supported by both ‘specific evidence’ on the record and
detailed findings by the lower courts” that the lodestar amount is unreasonably
low or unreasonably high.” (Van Gerwen v. Guarantee Mut. Life Co. (9th Cir.
2000) 214 F.3d 1041, 1045.) The court finds the lodestar determination
sufficiently addresses the fee. Nothing in the litigation over the subject
vehicle which led to a pre-trial settlement demonstrates a rare or exceptional
case showing a significant benefit beyond reimbursement for the vehicle and
lost time, as well as a fee reflecting the contingency nature of the
representation. (Blum v. Stenson (1984) 465 U.S. 886, 901; Hensley v. Eckerhart (1983)
461 U.S. 424, 434; see Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92
Cal.App.4th 819, 844.)
 
On costs, the
court appreciates the argument from GM regarding the lack of documentation, but
finds no improperly listed item. The items appear reasonable, especially given
the fixed fees for court costs, electronic filing, and video appearance,
without or without documentation. The service of process fees in no way appears
excessive. The court awards all costs.
 
The court therefore awards $22,440 in attorney fees plus $1,224.47
in costs for a total recovery of $23,664.47.
 
Because the amount of fees exceeds $5,000, the order is
immediately appealable. (Code Civ. Proc., 904.1, subd. (a)(12); Doe v. Luster (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th
139, 146.)
