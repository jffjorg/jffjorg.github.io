And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to enforce a settlement agreement. The motion was filed after the case was dismissed on December 26, 2023. In order for the court to enforce a settlement agreement, it must have retained jurisdiction under California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) section 664.6 before dismissal. However, in this case, no request was made to retain jurisdiction before dismissal, and the settlement agreement was not communicated to the court. The judge notes that the appellate court in Mesa v. City of Los Angeles (2019) held that three procedural requirements must be met in order for a court to retain jurisdiction, and that the request to retain jurisdiction must be made at the request of the parties, not just their attorneys. The court's order and reminders to counsel were insufficient to retain jurisdiction, and the motion is denied due to lack of jurisdiction.
