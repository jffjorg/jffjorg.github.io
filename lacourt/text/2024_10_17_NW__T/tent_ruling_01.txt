  Case Number:  22VECV00521    Hearing Date:   October 17, 2024    Dept:  T 22VECV00521 Manalaysay v
Southern California Home Care
Tentative
order: Motion to enforce settlement agreement filed by plaintiff: Deny.  In
order for the court to enforce a settlement agreement after the case has been
dismissed, the court had retain jurisdiction under CCP section 664.6 before
dismissal.  In this case, dismissal was entered on 12/26/2023.  
The appellate court
in Mesa v. City of Los Angeles (2019)
33 Cal.App.5th 913 held that three procedural
requirements must be met in order for a court to retain jurisdiction pursuant
to CCP 664.6:
1.   
The request to retain jurisdiction must be made before
dismissal is entered;
2.   
It must be made at the request of the parties, not
just at the request of their attorneys; and
3.   
It must be communicated to the
court, either through writing or through an oral agreement in open court,
but not merely by means of its inclusion as a term of a written settlement.  (Emphasis added.)
Since then, the statute
was amended to state that attorneys have authority to request the retention of
jurisdiction, not just the parties.
The court issued an order
on 9/8/2023 stating the requirements for the court to retain jurisdiction and
reminded counsel again on 10/23/2024.  Here,
nothing was filed prior to dismissal asking the court to retain jurisdiction pursuant
to CCP section 664.6  
The motion is denied as
the court lacks jurisdiction to enter judgment per CCP section 664.6 in this
action.
Clerk to give notice.
