And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the information presented before the court and is considering the issues raised in the case. The judge notes that ultimate facts are those that constitute the cause of action, such as the duty of care, breach of duty, and causation. The judge also notes that to survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action, and that the plaintiff does not need to specify which defendant's employees committed negligent acts or omissions. The judge is considering the case citations provided, including Doe v. City of Los Angeles, C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist., Central Valley General Hosp. v. Smith, and Rodriguez v. Parivar, Inc. The judge will consider these issues further before making a final ruling.
