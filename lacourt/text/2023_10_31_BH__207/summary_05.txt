And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, Barstow Outlet, LLC, to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff, Merchants Barstow LLC, alleges that the defendant misrepresented the power capacity of buildings leased to cannabis businesses, which caused harm to the businesses. The defendant argues that the plaintiff failed to state causes of action.

The judge sustains the defendant's demurrer to the second cause of action for breach of warranty of habitability, finding that the warranty does not apply to commercial leases, and the lease agreement between the parties explicitly disclaims any warranty of habitability.

The judge overrules the defendant's demurrer to the third, fourth, and fifth causes of action for intentional and negligent interference with prospective economic relations and aiding/abetting, finding that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged the elements of these causes of action.

The judge sustains the defendant's demurrer to the sixth cause of action for fraud without leave to amend, finding that the plaintiff failed to plead specific, non-conclusory facts demonstrating that the defendant knew the representations were false.

Finally, the judge orders the defendant to file an Answer to the FAC on or before November 28, 2023.
