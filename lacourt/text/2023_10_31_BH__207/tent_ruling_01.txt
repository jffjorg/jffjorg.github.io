MOTION
 
            Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant Sound
Equity High Income Debt Fund, LLC (“Plaintiff” or “Sound Equity”) moves for terminating
and monetary sanctions against Defendant and Cross-Complainant Andre Wegner
(“Defendant” or “Wegner”) for failure to comply with the Court’s August 11,
2023 orders, ordering Wegner “to serve verified responses to the FROG, SPROG,
and RFP, without objections” and “to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of
$1,990 to Plaintiff, by and through counsel for Plaintiff, within 30 days of
notice of the Court’s orders.”  (August
11, 2023 Minute Order.)
 
            Wegner has not opposed the motion.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
When a party misuses the discovery process by disobeying a court order
to provide discovery, the court in its discretion may impose a terminating
sanction by striking a party’s pleading or dismissing the action of the party.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, subd. (g), 2023.030, subds. (d)(1) & (d)(3);
2025.450, subd. (h), 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
California discovery law authorizes a range of
penalties for a party's refusal to obey a discovery order, including monetary
sanctions, evidentiary sanctions, issue sanctions, and terminating sanctions. A
court has broad discretion in selecting the appropriate penalty, . . . .
Despite this broad discretion, the courts have long recognized that the
terminating sanction is a drastic penalty and should be used sparingly. A trial
court must be cautious when imposing a terminating sanction because the sanction
eliminates a party's fundamental right to a trial, thus implicating due process
rights. The trial court should select a sanction that is tailored to the harm
caused by the withheld discovery. Sanctions should be appropriate to the
dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.
 
(Lopez
v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246
Cal.App.4th 566, 604 [cleaned up].) 
 
When a party fails to respond to the opposing
party's interrogatories, the court should begin by imposing monetary sanctions
and ordering the party to respond. If a party then fails to obey an order
compelling answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including
the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction.  In general, a court may not
impose issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions unless a party disobeys a
court order.  
 
(Moofly
Productions, LLC v. Favila (2020) 46 CalApp.5th 1, 11 [cleaned up] [citing Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (c)].)  However,
“a terminating sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a monetary
discovery sanction is never justified.” (Newland v. Superior Court
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 615.)
 
ANALYSIS
 
            On January 31, 2023, Plaintiff served the
FROG, SPROG, RFP, and RFA on Wegner electronically and by mail.  (Shakoori Decl. ¶ 3.)  Wegner did not respond to these
requests.  (Shakoori Decl. ¶ 4.)  Plaintiff subsequently sent Wegner three
emails to meet and confer regarding the outstanding discovery, but Wegner did
not respond.  (Shakoori Decl. ¶¶
5-7.)  Wegner failed to appear at the May
4, 2023 Status Conference Re: Mediation. 
(May 4, 2023 Minute Order.)  
 
Plaintiff moved to deem admitted the matters specified in the RFA, to
compel responses to the FROG, SPROG, and RFP, and for monetary sanctions.  Wegner did not oppose the motions or appear
at the hearing.  (August 11, 2023 Minute
Order.)  The Court granted Plaintiff’s
unopposed motions, deeming the RFA admitted, compelling responses to the FROG,
SPROG, and RFP, and ordering Wegner to pay $1,990 in monetary sanctions within
30 days of notice of the Court’s orders. 
(Ibid.)  
 
On August 15, 2023, Sound Equity served Wegner Notice of the Court’s
Order, via email and mail.  (Shakoori
Decl. ¶ 12.)  Plaintiff did not receive a
response from Wegner about the order, the ordered responses, or the monetary sanctions.  (Shakoori Decl. ¶¶ 12, 13.)
 
Plaintiff now moves for terminating and additional monetary sanctions,
for Wegner’s failure to comply with the Court’s August 11, 2023 Orders.  Wegner has not opposed the motion.  
 
As of the filing date of the motion, Wegner has not complied with the
Court’s orders to serve verified responses to the FROG, SPROG and RFP, or pay
the monetary sanctions.  Plaintiff has
thus disobeyed this Court’s August 11, 2023 Orders.  
 
Plaintiff is prejudiced by Wegner’s failure to engage in the discovery
process, because Plaintiff is unable to discover any critical facts, documents,
and percipient witnesses from Wegner relating to Plaintiff’s claims, Wegner’s
defenses, and Wegner’s cross-claims against Plaintiff.  
 
Moreover, Wegner has not opposed the motion, and has thus waived the
right to argue that a terminating sanction is unwarranted. (Sexton v.
Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Having found that Wegner has
failed to comply with the Court’s August 11, 2023 order, the Court grants
Plaintiff’s unopposed motion for terminating sanctions.  As such, under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.030, subdivisions (d)(1) & (d)(3), the Court strikes Wegner’s Answer
to the Complaint filed on July 6, 2021 and dismisses Wegner’s cross-complaint
filed July 6, 2021.  
 
With the Court granting
terminating sanctions against Wegner, the Court finds the imposition of
monetary sanctions to be moot.  
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice
of the Court’s ruling and file a proof of service of such.
