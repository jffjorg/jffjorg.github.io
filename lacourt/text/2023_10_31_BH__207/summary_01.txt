Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the Plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions against the Defendant, Andre Wegner, for Wegner's failure to comply with the Court's discovery orders. The Court finds that Wegner failed to respond to the Plaintiff's discovery requests, failed to appear at the May 4, 2023 Status Conference Re: Mediation, and failed to comply with the Court's orders to serve verified responses to the FROG, SPROG, and RFP, or pay the monetary sanctions. As a result, the Court strikes Wegner's Answer to the Complaint and dismisses Wegner's cross-complaint. The Court also finds that the imposition of monetary sanctions is moot.
