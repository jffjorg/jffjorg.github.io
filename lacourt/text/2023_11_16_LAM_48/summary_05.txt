And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ruled that the defendants' motion to dismiss or stay the action is granted. The parties had entered into a contract with a forum selection clause that requires any disputes to be resolved in Massachusetts courts. The plaintiff argues that the forum selection clause is unreasonable, but the court finds that the plaintiff has not shown that the application of the clause would be unfair or unreasonable. The court has stayed the action pending litigation in Massachusetts and has set a status conference for November 19, 2024.
