And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendant's motion for determination of partial satisfaction of judgment. The Defendant, City of Palmdale, argues that Plaintiff Michael Behen's continued employment from January 13, 2023, to July 3, 2023, constitutes partial satisfaction of the judgment for $150,161.00 and $95,000.00. The Judge disagrees, stating that the settlement agreement does not provide for reductions in the settlement payments if the Plaintiff does not resign by the specified date. The Judge also notes that the parties had contemplated the possibility of the Plaintiff not resigning by the specified date and did not provide for reductions in the settlement payments if that occurred. Therefore, the motion is denied.
