And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to vacate a sister-state judgment entered in California in 2012. The sister-state judgment was based on a judgment entered in Florida in 2011. However, the judge has found that the judgment in California is void because a sister-state judgment was already entered on the same judgment in Florida. The plaintiff did not renew the California judgment for 10 years and the defendant was not served with the judgment notice. The judge has granted the motion to vacate the judgment and the parties are required to notify the court if they intend to submit to the ruling.
