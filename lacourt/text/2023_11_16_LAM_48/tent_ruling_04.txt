On October 20, 2023, Petitioner
California Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Occupational Safety and
Health filed a petition to compel compliance with administrative subpoena.  Summons issued the same day.  No proof of service has been filed.
“In
the investigation of the policies and practices of an employer or a related employer
entity, the division may issue a subpoena if the employer or the related employer
entity fails to promptly provide the requested information, and may enforce the
subpoena if the employer or the related employer entity fails to provide the requested
information within a reasonable period of time.”  (Lab. Code, § 6317.9.)  If a witness fails to produce documents required
by the subpoena, the head of the department may petition the court  for an order compelling the person to respond.  (Gov. Code, § 11187, subd. (a).)
“Upon
the filing of the petition the court shall enter an order directing the person to
appear before the court at a specified time and place and then and there show cause
why he or she has not attended, testified, answered interrogatories, or produced
or permitted the inspection or copying of the papers . . . as required.  A copy of the order shall be served upon him or
her in the manner provided for the service of a summons.”  (Gov. Code, § 11188.)
Accordingly,
the Court sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Respondent’s Failure to Comply With Administrative
Subpoena on January 4, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 48 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
No
later than December 21, 2023, Petitioner is ordered to file a proof of service of
the petition, summons, and this order on Respondent.
Moving
