```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying as moot a motion to compel further responses from Industria (USA) LLC to a request for production of documents from Diana Lands. The dispute arose from Industria's initial responses to Lands's request, which did not identify which documents were produced by which plaintiff or which request they were responsive to. Industria served supplemental responses on December 21, 2022, which identified the documents by RFP number and provided the starting and ending Bates-stamp pages for each complete document. The judge finds that this response is compliant with the discovery requests and resolves the issue set forth by Lands. The motion is denied as moot, and the requests for sanctions are denied.
