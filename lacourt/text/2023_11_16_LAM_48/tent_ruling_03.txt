[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR DETERMINATION
  OF PARTIAL SATISFACTION OF JUDGMENT 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
November 16, 2023



 
On July 24, 2023, the Court entered
judgment in favor of Plaintiff Michael “Mike” Behen and against Defendant City of
Palmdale.  The judgment consists of $
$450,000.00
“made payable jointly to BEHEN and BEHEN’s legal counsel, for non-wage based damages
and attorneys’ fees, with interest thereon at the legal rate from the date of judgment
until paid”; $150,161.00 “made payable to BEHEN with interest thereon at the legal
rate from the date of judgment until paid”; and $95,000.00 “made payable to BEHEN
as a severance payment of salary and benefits, with interest thereon at the legal
rate from the date of judgment until paid.”
Defendant
paid the $400,000.00 on July 26, 2023.  (Motion,
Ex. F.)  Defendant did not pay the other amounts
owed.
On
October 16, 2023, Defendant filed a motion for determination of partial satisfaction
of judgment.
The
judgment was entered pursuant to the parties’ settlement agreement.  Under the settlement agreement, City was to pay
Plaintiff $150,161.00 for the present-day value of the loss in pension income he
will incur by retiring January 2023 instead of January 2024, and $495,000.00 as
a severance payment of salary and benefits. 
(Motion, Ex. A, ¶¶ 3(B)-3(C).)  Plaintiff
“agree[d] to voluntarily and irrevocably separate his employment . . . no later
than January 13, 2023.”  (Motion, Ex. A, ¶¶
3(D).)  If Plaintiff did not “take affirmative
steps to resign or retire from his employment as of the Separation Date, his voluntary
resignation shall be deemed effective and the City will process a voluntary separation
on his behalf.”  (Motion, Ex. A, ¶¶ 3(D).)
Defendant
argues that Plaintiff’s continued employment from January 13, 2023, through July
3, 2023, under which Behen’s pension continued to accrue, constitutes a partial
satisfaction of the $150,161.00.  According
to Defendant’s calculations, the amount remaining for loss in pension income is
$79,585.00 (53-percent of the $150,161.00). 
Defendant also argues that Plaintiff’s continued employment through July
3, 2023, whereby City paid Plaintiff the sum of $103,718.98 in salary with full
benefits, constitutes full satisfaction of the $95,000.00.
Judgment
has already been entered pursuant to the settlement agreement.  The judgment is not conditional: it awards Plaintiff
$450,000.00 for non-wage-based damages and attorneys’ fees; $150,161.00 without
any description; and $95,000.00 “as a severance payment of salary and benefits.”
Defendant
did object to Plaintiff’s proposed judgment and sought a pro-rata reduction for
the months Plaintiff continued to work until date of entry of judgment.  (See Motion, Ex. C.)  But no such offset or reduction is contained in
the parties’ settlement agreement.  What Defendant
is actually seeking is a reformation of the settlement agreement and the judgment.
Defendant
argues that equity demands that it be given credit for the payments Plaintiff received
when he was still employed so he does not receive double recovery.  (Motion at p. 6.)  When objecting to the proposed judgment, Defendant
also argued that Plaintiff should not be allowed to benefit from his breach of the
settlement agreement (by not resigning by January 13, 2023).
The
Court will not decide the merits of any alleged breach of contract by Plaintiff,
especially when the settlement agreement expressly contemplated Plaintiff’s failure
to resign by that date.  (Motion, Ex. A, ¶
3(D).)  If that occurred, Defendant would
process his voluntary resignation, which it did not due until July 3, 2023.  (Motion, Ex. A, ¶ 3(D).)  Thus, the parties had contemplated the possibility
of Plaintiff not resigning by the specified date, and they did not provide for reductions
of the settlement payments if that occurred.
Accordingly,
the motion for determination of partial satisfaction of judgment is DENIED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
