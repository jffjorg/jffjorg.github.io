[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING AS MOOT MOTION
  TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES

On May 23, 2022, Jessica De Rothschild, Alexander Gervasi,
and Industria (USA) LLC (“Industria”) filed this action against Diana Lands aka
Diana Lands Nathanson (“Lands”) and Diana Lands Nathanson Design Inc.
On
September 7, 2022, Lands served Request for Production of Documents, Set One on
Industria.  (Dove Decl. ¶ 2.)  Industria served responses on October 21 and
25, 2022.  (Dove Decl. ¶¶ 3-4.)  According to Lands, “there were 9,753 pages
of documents divided into 2,737 separate pdf files.  This production was a collective of documents
produced by all 3 Plaintiffs. . . . None of the documents were identified to
allow a reader to know which plaintiff produced which documents or which
Request the documents were responsive to.” 
(Dove Decl. ¶ 5.)
On
October 31, 2022, Lands’s counsel sent a letter to Industria’s counsel.  (Dove Decl. ¶ 6.)  During a call on December 7, 2022, Lands’s
counsel contended that the responses were noncompliant.  (Dove Decl. ¶ 7.)
Industria
served supplemental responses on December 21, 2022.  (Dove Decl. ¶ 9.)  Of the 67 categories of documents requested, Industria
responded that it would produce documents responsive to 53 categories.  (Dove Decl. ¶ 10.)   However, Lands’s counsel was unable to discern
what documents were produced in response to which request or category of
documents.  (Dove Decl. ¶ 10.)
Lands
filed a motion to compel compliance (Code Civ Proc., § 2031.280) on July 12,
2023.
According
to Lands’s counsel, “Between the October 31 correspondence and December 7
telephone conference, I have satisfied the meet and confer requirements of Code
of Civ. Proc. §2016.040 to reach an informal resolution to this issue.”  (Dove Decl. ¶ 8.)  However, counsel did not meet and confer
after Industria’s December 21, 2022 supplemental responses, despite Industria’s
counsel’s attempts.  (See Elsea Decl. ¶¶
10-13.)  Nevertheless, the Court will
rule on the merits of the motion.
If
a party filing a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling thereafter fails to permit the inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling in accordance with that party’s statement of compliance, the demanding
party may move for an order compelling compliance.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320, subd. (a).)
“Any
documents or category of documents produced in response to a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling shall be identified with the specific
request number to which the documents respond.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.280, subd. (a).)  “There is no requirement that a response
identify a document with the specific request to which the document applies,”
and no requirement that documents be Bates-stamped.  (Pollock v. Superior Court of Los Angeles
County (2023) 93 Cal.App.5th 1348, 1358.)
On
September 1, 2023, Industria’s counsel sent to Lands’s counsel a spreadsheet
categorizing the documents by RFP number. 
(Elsea Decl., Ex. B.)  This
spreadsheet clearly states the beginning and ending Bates-stamp pages for each
complete document, and it lists the RFPs for which the document is
responsive.  This is a compliant response
and resolves the issue set forth by Lands.
Accordingly,
the motion is DENIED AS MOOT.
The
requests for sanctions are denied.  Lands
should have continued to meet and confer after receiving supplemental responses
on December 21, 2022 and before filing this motion on July 12, 2023.  Industria should not have waited until
September 1, 2023 to identify the documents because Lands’s October 31, 2022 specifically
stated the issue.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
