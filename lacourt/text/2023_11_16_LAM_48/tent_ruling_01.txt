  CASE NO.: 22STCP02242
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO VACATE
  JUDGMENT 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
November 16, 2023



 
On
January 5, 2012, Plaintiff Redwood Recovery Services, LLC sought a sister-state
judgment in this Court against Defendant Jeffrey L. Kirsch based on a judgment
entered in March 2011 by the Circuit Court for the Eleventh Judicial Circuit in
and for Miami-Dade County in Florida. 
(Motion at p. 2; RJN, Ex. B.)  Judgment
was entered on January 31, 2012.  (Motion
at p. 2; RJN, Ex. C.)  Plaintiff did not renew
the California judgment during the next ten years.
On June 9, 2022, Plaintiff
filed another application for entry of sister-state judgment against Defendant,
again based on the March 2011 Florida judgment. 
Defendant was never served with the application or judgment notice in
this action.  (Motion at p. 2; Kirsch
Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.)
On
October 13, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to vacate the sister-state
judgment.  (Defendant’s request for
judicial notice is granted.)  Plaintiff
filed a notice of non-opposition.
No
sister-state judgment may be entered when a judgment has previously been entered
in California.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1710.55,
1710.60.)  Because a sister-state
judgment was already entered on the March 2011 Florida judgment, the judgment
in this action is void.
Accordingly,
the unopposed motion to vacate judgment is GRANTED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
