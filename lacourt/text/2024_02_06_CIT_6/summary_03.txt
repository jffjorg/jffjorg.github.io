And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Xinting Li Chan v. Perla Gu, dismissing the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff alleges that a dog-bite incident occurred on or about November 9, 2021, and is seeking damages. The defendant filed a demurrer, arguing that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and that the statute of limitations has expired.

The judge rejected the defendant's argument, finding that the "on or about" phrase in the complaint is sufficient to overcome a demurrer based on the statute of limitations. The judge also rejected the defendant's request for judicial notice of certain documents, finding that they are not relevant to the case.

The judge ordered the plaintiff to give notice of the ruling within five calendar days of the order.
