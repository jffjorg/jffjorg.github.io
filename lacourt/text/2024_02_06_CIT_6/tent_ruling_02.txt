The  2/6/24 OSC re Entry of Default Judgment will be taken off-calendar.            BACKGROUND             This  is a breach of rental agreement action. On September 8, 2022, plaintiffs  Gonzalo R. Vazquez and Leticia Vazquez (collectively, Plaintiffs) filed this  action against defendants Arcadio Toribio, Joanna Aranda (collectively,  Defendants), and Does 1 through 50, alleging causes of action for breach of  contract and common counts. Default was entered against the Defendants on May  2, 2023. On December 8, 2023, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ request for entry of  default judgment. On January 16, 2024, Plaintiffs resubmitted their request for  entry of default judgment.            LEGAL  STANDARD Code of  Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party  has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party  seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court  Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other  admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest  computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a  proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment  is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil  Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7)  exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by  statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1800.)  ANALYSIS Plaintiffs  seek default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $23,495.85,  including $20,628.00 in damages, $2,197.85 in interest, $0.00 in attorney fees,  and $670.00 in costs. The Court notes that Plaintiffs have submitted sufficient  evidence in support of the Judgment requested. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s  request for entry of default judgment in the amount of $23,495.85.  CONCLUSION              Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment is GRANTED in the amount of $23,495.85. The Court will sign the Proposed Judgment. The 2/6/24 OSC re Entry of Default Judgment will be taken off-calendar.
