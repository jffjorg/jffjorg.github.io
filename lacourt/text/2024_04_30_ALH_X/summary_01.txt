**Case Number:** 22AHCV01275

**Hearing Date:** April 30, 2024

**Judge:** Joel L. Lofton

**Tentative Ruling:**

**Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment**

The defendant, FCA US LLC, has moved for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiff's first cause of action for violation of the Song-Beverly Act - breach of express warranty is barred because the vehicle purchased by the plaintiff was a "used" vehicle, not a "new" motor vehicle. The court has reviewed the pleadings, evidence, and arguments presented by both parties.

**Discussion:**

The court has considered the plain meaning of the phrase "other motor vehicle sold with a manufacturer's new car warranty" under Section 1793.22(e)(2) of the Song-Beverly Act. The phrase is part of the definition of "new motor vehicle" and includes vehicles that have never been previously sold to a consumer and come with full express warranties.

The court has also considered the legislative intent behind the Song-Beverly Act and the Motor Vehicle Warranty Adjustment Programs. The court has found that the Act defines "express warranty" as any written statement arising out of a sale to the consumer of a consumer good, and defines "consumer" as any person to whom the motor vehicle is transferred during the duration of an express warranty.

Based on these textual reasons, the court concludes that the phrase "other motor vehicle sold with a manufacturer's new car warranty" unambiguously refers to cars that come with a new or full express warranty, and does not include used cars sold with a balance remaining on a manufacturer's new car warranty.

**Conclusion:**

The defendant's motion for summary judgment is hereby denied. The matter will proceed to trial.

**RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER ACTION:**

3. The trial is set for June 4, 2024, at 9:00 a.m.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the parties are directed to comply with the recommendations for further action set forth above.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the trial is set for June 4, 2024, at 9:00 a.m.
