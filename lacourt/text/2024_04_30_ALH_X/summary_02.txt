And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

**Tentative Ruling**

The court grants Plaintiff's motions to compel discovery, including responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, requests for production of documents, and have admissions deemed admitted. The court also grants Plaintiff's requests for sanctions in the amount of $300 per motion for a total of $1200. The court finds that Defendant's failure to provide verified responses to discovery and its subsequent unverified responses are ineffective and deemed no response at all. The court finds that Defendant's actions necessitate the imposition of sanctions.
