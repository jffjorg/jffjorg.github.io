And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the proposed settlement between the plaintiffs and the defendant and has found it to be fair and reasonable. The plaintiffs, who include Tonia Perez, Myrical Alexiou, Latesha Silva, Antonio Winston, and Heaven Duran (a minor), had filed a complaint against the defendant alleging various claims, including negligence, breach of warranty, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The proposed settlement has been approved by the court, and the petition to approve the minor's compromise has also been granted. The court has also approved the requested attorneys' fees as fair and reasonable. The next step is for the parties to give notice of the court's decision.
