**Tentative Ruling**

The court has issued a tentative ruling on two motions: Plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint to add a cause of action for fraud and to add additional defendants, and Defendant's motion to strike portions of the complaint.

The court has denied Plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint, citing procedural deficiencies and lack of explanation for the delay. The court has also denied Defendant's request to strike punitive damages and attorney's fees, finding that Plaintiff has pled facts supporting their claims.

The court has granted Defendant's request to strike attorney's fees, as Plaintiff has agreed to withdraw their request. The court has denied Defendant's request to strike Defendant's personal liability, finding that Plaintiff has pled facts supporting their claims.

The court has also denied Defendant's request to strike the complaint's allegations of personal liability, finding that the bouncers' conduct was an outgrowth of their employment and reasonably foreseeable.

The court has denied Defendant's request to strike punitive damages, finding that Plaintiff has pled facts supporting their claims of oppression, fraud, or malice.
