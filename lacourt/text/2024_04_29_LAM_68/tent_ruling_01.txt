REQUESTED
Motion
for Leave to Amend to File a First Amended Cross-Complaint
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On July 1, 2014, Plaintiff Catani, LLC became the assignee
to a lease for 117 E. Harvard St., Glendale. Defendant Brand Boulevard
Associates, L.P. owns the parcel and assigned the lease. Plaintiff opened Oak
& Vine Restaurant on the first floor and loft area of the premises. In
2017, renovations began for the opening of “Veranda” restaurant operating on
the rooftop immediately above Oak & Vine. Defendant Elevate Venues, LLC was
responsible for the operation of Veranda.
 
Plaintiff alleges the renovations, including improperly
installed drainage and plumbing systems, caused water leakage into Oak &
Vine restaurant, thereby interfering with business operations. On June 15,
2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Negligence, Implied Contractual
Indemnity, Breach of Contract/Lease, and Negligent Interference with
Prospective Economic Advantage. On August 31, 2023, Brand Boulevard Associates,
L.P. answered the complaint, and filed a cross-complaint against Elevate Venues
and Catani, LLC for Indemnity and Contribution. Plaintiff answered the
cross-complaint on September 27, 2023. On December 15, 2023, Elevate Venues
answered the complaint, and cross-complaint. On December 20, 2023, Elevate
Venues, Inc. filed a cross-complaint for Equitable Indemnity, Apportionment,
Contribution, and Declaratory Relief. 
 
RULING: Granted.
Plaintiff Brand Boulevard Associates, L.P. moves for leave
to amend to file a first amended cross-complaint in order to add a new cause of
action for Express Contractual Indemnity and Breach of Contract. The motion
comes in order for Defendant/Cross-Complainant to “seek all viable legal
theories” against the restaurant operators. The court electronic filing system
shows no opposition or reply on file at the time of the tentative ruling
publication cutoff.
 
A
motion for leave to amend must comply with the requirements set forth in
California Rules of Court Rule 3.1324, which states as follows:
 
“(a)      Contents of motion
A
motion to amend a pleading before trial must:
(1)              
Include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended
pleading, which must be serially numbered to differentiate it from previous
pleadings or amendments;
(2)              
State what allegations in the previous pleading are
proposed to be deleted, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number,
the deleted allegations are located; and 
(3)              
State what allegations are proposed to be added to the
previous pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the
additional allegations are located.
 
(b)        Supporting declaration
A
separate declaration must accompany the motion and must specify:
(1)        The effect of the amendment;
(2)        Why the amendment is necessary and
proper;
(3)        When the facts giving
rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and 
(4)              
The reasons why the request for amendment was not made 
earlier…” (emphasis added).
 
Dilatory delays and prejudice to the opposing parties is a
valid ground for denial. (Hirsa v.
Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490.)  Prejudice exists where the amendment would
require delaying the trial, resulting in loss of critical evidence, or added
costs of preparation such as an increased burden of discovery. (Magpali v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48
Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488.) 
 
Leave to amend is generally liberally granted. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 473(a); Mesler v. Bragg
Management Co. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 290, 296.) The court will not generally
consider the validity of the proposed amended pleading in ruling on a motion
for leave, instead deferring such determinations for a demurrer or motion to
strike, unless the proposed amendment fails to state a valid claim as a matter
of law. (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Marker, U.S.A.) (1989) 213
Cal. App.3d 1045, 1048; California
Casualty Gen. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 274, 280–281
disapproved of on other grounds by
Kransco v. American Empire Surplus Lines Ins. Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 390.) 
 
The motion comes more than five months after the filing of
the cross-complaint without any explanation for the timing of the motion.
[Declaration of Gregory Dilts.] Because the changes
arise from the common core of facts and otherwise adds no material change to
the underlying action, however, the court finds no showing of significant
prejudice to Defendant. Any potential claimed prejudice insufficiently
outweighs the liberal policy for leave to amend. No trial date is set, thereby
allowing sufficient time to address any potential new arguments pre-trial. (Magpali
v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-487; Hulsey v.
Koehler (1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 1150, 1159.)
 
The motion is therefore granted.
Moving party to file a separate copy of the first amended cross-complaint
within 10 days of the order.
