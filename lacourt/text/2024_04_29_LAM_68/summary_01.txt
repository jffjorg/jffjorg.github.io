Summary in English:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion for leave to amend the cross-complaint to add a new cause of action for Express Contractual Indemnity and Breach of Contract. The motion is opposed by the Plaintiff, but since the court finds no showing of significant prejudice to the Defendant, the motion is granted. The court orders the Plaintiff to file a separate copy of the first amended cross-complaint within 10 days of the order.
