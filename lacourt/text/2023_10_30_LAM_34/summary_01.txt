The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of M. R. v. YMCA of Hollywood, California (Doe 1). The defendant, YMCA of Hollywood, California, has moved the court to compel the plaintiff, M. R., to respond to discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production. The defendant has also moved the court to have its requests for admissions deemed admitted and to impose monetary sanctions on the plaintiff.

The court has granted the defendant's motion to compel responses to the discovery requests and has ordered the plaintiff to provide initial responses within 45 days. The court has also denied the defendant's request for monetary sanctions, finding that the plaintiff appears to be litigating in propria persona and that monetary sanctions would be unjust.

The court has also granted the defendant's motion to have its requests for admissions deemed admitted, finding that the plaintiff failed to respond to the requests. The court has denied the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in connection with this motion, finding that the admission of the requests for admission terminates the case and that further sanctions are not necessary.
