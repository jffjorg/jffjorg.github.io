The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to set aside default filed by defendants Scorpion Services, Inc. and GHP Management Corp. The motion was filed in response to the default entered against them on August 27, 2024, due to their failure to respond to the complaint filed on June 28, 2024. The defendants argue that their failure to respond was caused by the mistake of their counsel, who failed to timely follow up with all defendants regarding conflict-of-interest waivers. The court finds that the defendants have adequately demonstrated mistake of counsel and grants their motion to set aside default. The answer filed on September 5, 2024, is deemed the operative answer for the moving defendants.
