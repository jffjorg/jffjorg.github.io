STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for breach of contract, fraud, and conversion.
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants failed to make agreed-upon payments to
purchase a business owned and operated by Plaintiffs. 
 
Plaintiffs move to enforce a
settlement and for attorney’s fees. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Plaintiffs’
Motion to Enforce Settlement is GRANTED.
 
            Plaintiffs
are directed to prepare a proposed judgment in conformity with the Court’s
order to be served on all parties and filed within 10 days of this order.
 
            Plaintiffs’
request for attorney’s fees is GRANTED. Plaintiffs are awarded attorney’s fees
in the amount of $1,960 for enforcement of the settlement. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Plaintiffs move to enforce a
settlement and for attorney’s fees. 
Legal Standard
 
            Enforcement
of settlement agreements is governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.
This statute provides, in relevant part:
 
If the
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of
the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant
to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may
retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement. 
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 664.6(a).) The
Court is empowered under this section to resolve reasonable disputes over the
terms of a settlement. (Machado v. Myers (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 779,
795.) The Court does not insert provisions into the parties’ agreement, but
applies the rules of contract construction to interpret the terms of the
settlement. (Id. at 792.) When extrinsic evidence is necessary, the
Court may decide the motion on declarations alone. (Richardson v. Richardson
(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 91, 97.) 
 
Procedural Posture of Motion
 
            Plaintiffs
originally presented this motion as an ex parte application for the
same relief, filed on September 12, 2024. On September 18, 2024, the Court
denied the application, but specially set a hearing on a Motion to Enforce
Settlement for October 31, 2024. (September 18, 2024 Minute Order.) The ex
parte application was deemed the moving papers, with an opposition and
reply brief to be served and filed pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
1005(b). (Id.) 
 
            Although
Defendants filed an initial opposition to the ex parte application on
September 17, 2024 at 7:52 PM, and an amended opposition at 9:02 PM that same
date, no separate opposition was filed after the Court’s September 18 ruling. Plaintiffs
filed a reply brief on October 24, 2024 which addresses the amended opposition.
The Court therefore construes the Amended Opposition filed September 17 as the
opposition to the motion to enforce settlement, and will consider that
opposition on its merits.
 
Enforcement of Settlement
 
            At a Final
Status Conference on March 27, 2024, counsel for Plaintiffs appeared and
reported that the parties had reached a settlement following mediation. (March
27, 2024 Minute Order.) Plaintiffs presented a copy of the settlement agreement
with their ex parte application, which is dated March 18, 2024 and
signed by all parties. (Ex Parte App. Exh. B.) The relevant terms of the
settlement are that Defendants Warren and Evans will pay Plaintiffs the sum of
$100,000 on or before May 18, 2024 in exchange for a dismissal and release of
claims. (Id. §§ 1-2.) The settlement expressly provides for the Court to
retain jurisdiction to enforce the settlement pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6. (Id. § 4.) 
            Plaintiffs
contend that Defendants never paid the sum owed under the settlement agreement.
(Declaration of Paul Antriasian ISO App. ¶ 2.) In response, Defendants contend
that the parties subsequently agreed, through email correspondence between
their counsel, to separate the payment into two installments; the first
installment for $30,000 due by July 8, 2024, and the remaining balance due by
August 15, 2024. (Defendants’ Exh. A.) Defendants claim that they attempted to
make the first payment, but were notified on July 12 that the wire transfer was
unsuccessful, and notified Plaintiffs on July 15 of the issue. (Id.)
Defendants then assert that they received “mixed messaging” and were uncertain
of the posture of this dispute. This contention is not supported by evidence, however,
and, in any event, it remains undisputed that no money has been paid, whatever
the payment schedule. Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to an order entering
judgment for the sum owed under the settlement agreement. 
 
Attorney’s Fees
 
            Plaintiffs
also request an award of attorney’s fees in the amount of $4,097.50 pursuant to
the terms of the settlement. The settlement expressly provides for an award of “reasonable
attorney’s fees required to enforce the terms” of the settlement. (Plaintiffs’
Exh. B. § 4.) 
 
Reasonable
attorney’s fees shall be fixed by the Court and shall be an element of the
costs of suit. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(c)(5)(B).) Reasonable attorney’s fees
are ordinarily determined by the Court pursuant to the “lodestar” method, i.e.,
the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly
rate. (See PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084,
1095-1096; Margolin v. Regional Planning Com. (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999,
1004 [“California courts have consistently held that a computation of time
spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a
determination of an appropriate attorneys' fee award.”].) In setting the hourly rate for a fee
award, courts are entitled to consider the “fees customarily charged by that
attorney and others in the community for similar work.” (Bihun v. AT&T
Info. Sys., Inc. (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 976, 997 [affirming rate of $450 per
hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin v. Watkins Associated Indus.
(1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 664.)  The burden is on the party seeking attorney’s
fees to prove the reasonableness of the fees. (Center for Biological
Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603,
615.) 
 
The Court has broad discretion in
determining the amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee award, which will not be
overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law,
or necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi
v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-1394.)  The
Court need not explain its calculation of the amount of attorney’s fees awarded
in detail; identifying the factors considered in arriving at the amount will
suffice. (Ventura v. ABM Indus. Inc. (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258,
274-275.)
 
            Here,
Plaintiffs’ counsel states that he incurred 6.5 hours of attorney time at his
customary rate of $475 per hour, plus 2 anticipated hours for the hearing on
this motion and $60 in filing fees. (Declaration of Armen F. Papazian ISO App.
¶ 7.) This request is excessive in light of Plaintiffs’ counsel’s considerable
experience spanning over two decades. (Id.) It should not have taken 6.5
hours of attorney time for a straightforward motion such as this. The Court
will therefore award fees reflecting 4 total hours of attorney time, plus
costs, for a total of $1,960 in attorney’s fees and costs.  
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Enforce Settlement is GRANTED.
 
            Plaintiffs
are directed to prepare a proposed judgment in conformity with the Court’s order
to be served on all parties and filed within 10 days of this order.
 
            Plaintiffs’
request for attorney’s fees is GRANTED. Plaintiffs are awarded attorney’s fees
in the amount of $1,960 for enforcement of the settlement. 
 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
