for Judgment on the Pleadings 
Moving Party:             Defendant Trinity Financial Services, LLC

Opposing Party:          Plaintiff
Pablo Aleman, Jr.

Tentative Ruling:      The
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings as to the fifth cause of action is granted
without leave to amend. 

             
            This is a wrongful foreclosure
action in which Plaintiff Pablo Aleman Jr. (Plaintiff) sues Defendants Trinity
Financial Services, LLC (Trinity) and Barret Daffin Frappier Tredder &
Weiss, LLP (Barrett Daffin).[1]

 
According to the
pleadings, in March of 2006, Plaintiff took out a second mortgage (Subject
Loan) on his home for $82,000 which was secured by a Deed of Trust (Subject
DOT). In 2008, Plaintiff was in arrears on both his primary mortgage and the
Subject Loan. As part of a negotiated modification, Plaintiff alleged, the
Subject loan was cancelled. Plaintiff bore the tax consequences of the
cancellation. After the Subject Loan was cancelled in 2008, Plaintiff did not
receive any statements regarding the Subject Loan. Nor did Plaintiff receive
notice that the previous trustee had assigned its rights under the Subject DOT
to Trinity. Nonetheless, on February 5, 2021, Barrett Daffin, on behalf of
Trinity, recorded a Notice of Default and Election to Sell Under Deed of Trust
(NOD) on Plaintiff’s property. The NOD states Plaintiff owes $157,643.19 as of
February 3, 2021.
 
On October 18,
2021, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint alleging causes of action for (1.) promissory estoppel, (2.) unfair business practices,
(3.) wrongful foreclosure, (4.) negligent misrepresentations, (5.) violation of
Civil Code section 2924.17, (6.) violation in the truth in lending act, (7.)
violation of the federal and California Rosenthal Fair Debt Collections
Practices Act, and (8.) slander of title. 
 
The Court previously sustained Trinity’s demurrer to
the fourth cause of action for negligent misrepresentation without leave to
amend. Trinity also moved for summary judgment or in the alternative for
summary adjudication; the Court denied the motion for summary judgment but
granted the motion for summary adjudication of the first cause of action for
promissory estoppel and third cause of action for wrongful foreclosure.

 
Defendant moves
for judgment on the pleadings as to the fifth cause of action in the First
Amended Complaint, violation of Civil Code section 2924.17.  Plaintiff opposes the motion. 
 
            The Court grants the motion for
judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend. 
 
            Defendant’s request for judicial
notice of Exhibits A-K is granted. (Evid. Code § 452, subd. (g), (h).)
 
Legal Standard 
 
         “[A] motion for judgment
on the pleadings is the functional equivalent of a general demurrer. . . .
Indeed, the only significant difference between the two motions is in their
timing.”  (People v. $20,000 U.S. Currency (1991)
235 Cal.App.3d 682, 691.)
 
            A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency
of a pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley v. Harvey (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a pleading, for the purpose
of determining its effect, its allegations must be liberally construed, with a
view to substantial justice between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The
court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly
pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law . . ..” ’
” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.)  
 
Analysis 
            
 
Fifth Cause
of Action for Violation of Civil Code section 2924.17:
 
Defendant
Trinity moves for judgment on the pleadings of the fifth cause of action on the
grounds the claim is moot.
Civil Code
section 2924.17 subsections (a) and (b) set forth requirements for certain
documents that have been filed or recorded by a mortgage servicer in connection
with a foreclosure. Section 2924.17 requires that any Notice of Default “be
accurate and complete and supported by competent and reliable evidence.” (Civ.
Code, § 2924.17, subd. (a).) A mortgage servicer recording or filing a Notice
of Default must therefore review “competent and reliable evidence to
substantiate the borrower's default.” (Civ. Code, § 2924.17, subd. (b).)
With
respect to the fifth cause of action, the FAC alleges that Defendant Trinity
“failed to properly calculate the amount due and owing under the Plaintiff’s
loan, considering Trinity and the beneficiary are prohibited from accruing
interest and fees on the loan for the time it was charged off.” (FAC ¶ 82.)
Defendant
now moves for judgment on the pleadings as to this cause of action because the
notice of default challenged under this cause of action was rescinded. (RJN Ex.
K.) 
In February
2021, a Notice of Default and Election to Sell Under Deed of Trust (First NOD)
was recorded with the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office on behalf of Trinity
in connection with the Subject Loan. (FAC, ¶ 16.) The First NOD was recorded on
February 5, 2021, with the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Officer as instrument
number 20210205190. (RJN Ex. H.) The First NOD states that as of February 3,
2021, the amount in arrears due under the Second Loan was $154,643.19. (RJN Ex.
H.) However, the First NOD was rescinded by means of a Notice of Recission of
Notice of Default (First Recission) that was recorded on October 29, 2021, with
the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office as instrument number 20211625932. (RJN
Ex. I.) 
Another
Notice of Default and Election to Sell Under Deed of Trust (Second NOD) was
recorded on October 29, 2021, with the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Officer as
instrument number 20211625934. (RJN Ex. J.) The Second NOD states that as of
October 27, 2021, the amount in arrears due under the Second Loan was
$244,845.38. (RJN Ex. J.) However, the Second NOD was rescinded by means of a
Notice of Recission of Notice of Default (Second Recission) that was recorded
on May 3, 2023, with the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office as instrument
number 20230286292. (RJN Ex. K.)
In the
absence of a notice of default, Defendant argues Plaintiff cannot achieve any
relief and the case is, therefore, moot. (Lincoln Place Tenants Assn. v.
City of Los Angeles (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 425, 454 [“[A] case becomes moot
when a court ruling can have no practical effect or cannot provide the parties
with effective relief.”].) 
In
opposition, Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s motion “overly simplifies a
borrower’s rights pursuant to Civil Code 2924.17(a)-(b).” (Opp., 5:12.) Without
citing any legal authority, Plaintiff contends that the “rescission of the
Notice of Default, notably after litigation is initiated for a violation of
Civil Code 2924.17, would not presumptively cure the violation.” (Opp.,
5:21-22.) Conspicuously absent from Plaintiff’s opposition is any discussion of
the relief that may be obtained under Civil Code section 2924.17, where there
is no operative notice of default.
 
The
Opposition is unpersuasive. As the reply notes, the only relief available for
an alleged violation of Section 2924.17 when a trustee’s sale has not occurred
is injunctive relief enjoining the pending foreclosure. 
In
Homeowners Bill of Rights (HBOR), the California Legislature expressly provided
a limited private right of action under California Civil Code sections 2924.12
(section 2924.12) and 2924.19 (section 2924.19). (Lucioni v. Bank of
America, N.A. (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 150, 158–159.) For a “material
violation” of any one of a list of nine statutory provisions within its scheme
– which includes section 2924.17 – it authorizes pre-foreclosure injunctive
relief (Civ. Code § 2924.12, subd. (a)(1); Civ. Code § 2924.19, subd. (a)(1));
post-foreclosure claims for “actual economic damages pursuant to Section 3281”
(Civ. Code § 2924.12, subd. (b); Civ. Code § 2924.19, subd. (b)); the greater
of trebled damages or $50,000 where the violation was “intentional or reckless”
or “resulted from willful misconduct” (Civ. Code § 2924.12, subd. (b); Civ.
Code § 2924.19, subd. (b)); and attorney fees and costs as a reward to
prevailing claimants (Civ. Code § 2924.12, subd. (h); Civ. Code § 2924.19,
subd. (h)).
 
Importantly,
under section 2924.12, “injunctive relief is available only if a foreclosure
sale is pending.” (Shupe v. Nationstar Mortgage LLC (E.D. Cal. 2017) 231
F.Supp.3d 597, 603; 
 Where, as here, there is no notice of default,
there can be no pending foreclosure to enjoin. Thus, the claim is moot.
 
Plaintiff
also argues that a violation of Civil Code section 2924.17 occurs before the
recording of the notice of default by pointing to statutory language that
requires a mortgage servicer “ensure that it has reviewed competent and
reliable evidence to substantiate the borrower's default and the right to
foreclose, including the borrower's loan status and loan information” before
these documents are recorded. (Civ. Code, § 2924.17, subd. (b).) That is, the
violation occurs before the recording and the recording is merely evidence of
the violation. 
 
Plaintiff’s
statutory interpretation – even if correct –would not likely change the Court’s
finding of mootness, but, in any case, this interpretation is incorrect. As the
reply notes, this interpretation analysis overlooks the entirety of Civil Code
section 2924.17, which must be read as a whole. Specifically, subdivision (c)
of the statute identifies the violation as occurring when a “mortgage servicer
[] engages in multiple and repeated uncorrected violations of subdivision (b) in
recording documents or filing documents in any court relative to a foreclosure
proceeding.” (Civ. Code, § 2924.17, subd. (c) [emphasis added].) Thus, the
statute itself defines the violation as the recording or filing of noncompliant
documents. 
 
Conclusion
 
            The Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
of the fifth cause of action is granted without leave to amend.
