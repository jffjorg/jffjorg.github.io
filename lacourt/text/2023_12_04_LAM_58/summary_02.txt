Summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting the Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the fifth cause of action, which alleges a violation of Civil Code section 2924.17. The Court finds that the claim is moot because there is no notice of default and, therefore, no pending foreclosure to enjoin. The Court also concludes that the violation of Civil Code section 2924.17 occurs when a mortgage servicer "engages in multiple and repeated uncorrected violations of subdivision (b) in recording documents or filing documents in any court relative to a foreclosure proceeding." The Court's ruling is based on its analysis of the pleadings, the statutory language of Civil Code section 2924.17, and the absence of a notice of default.
