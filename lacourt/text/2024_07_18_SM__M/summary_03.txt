And here is a summary in English text of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied Plaintiff Ziba Razavi's motion for trial preference on the grounds that the Plaintiff has failed to provide sufficient evidence to support the claim. The Plaintiff has submitted medical documentation showing a range of medical conditions, including coronary artery calcification, carotid artery disease, and breast cancer, but the Judge does not consider this evidence to be "clear and convincing" proof of a substantial medical doubt of the Plaintiff's survival beyond six months. The Judge also denied the Plaintiff's request for judicial notice, citing the lack of relevance of the provided studies to the current case. As a result, the motion for trial preference is denied.
