Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The Defendant failed to file the principal evidence (Medical Records) in support of its motion, and instead lodged them with the Court without properly filing them. Additionally, the Defendant's citations to exhibits were impermissibly vague and did not comply with the California Rules of Court. As a result, the Court cannot consider the material evidence and cannot conclude that the Defendant has submitted evidence showing that there is no triable issue of fact as to the noticed issues. The Judge has denied the motion, requiring further proceedings in the case.
