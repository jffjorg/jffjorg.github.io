The motion was brought by Cross-Defendant Mary Ann Osborn, who sought to strike the allegations of intentional infliction of emotional distress, conversion of personal property, and invasion of privacy. The judge found that the allegations in the Cross-Complaint were sufficient to support the claims of malice and oppression, and that the conduct of Cross-Defendant was intended to cause injury and emotional distress to Cross-Complainant. The judge also noted that the allegations of outrageous and highly offensive conduct were supported by the facts, and that Cross-Complainant had suffered severe emotional distress as a result of Cross-Defendant's actions. Therefore, the motion to strike the punitive damage allegations was denied.
