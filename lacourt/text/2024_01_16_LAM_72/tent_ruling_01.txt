RULING
 



EDMOND DURHAM, 
 
                                  Plaintiff,
  
         v.
 
 
JOSE P. LAGUNA, et al.,
 
                                  Defendants.
 


 Case No: 
  22STCV16247
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  January 16, 2024
 Calendar Number:  1



 
 
 
Plaintiffs’ attorney Brenda E. Vargas (“Counsel”) moves to
be relieved as counsel.
 
Counsel’s motion is CONTINUED to January 30, 2024.  In addition, the Court advances and continues
the Final Status Conference, currently set for January 26, 2024 at 9:30 a.m.,
to January 30, 2024 at 8:30 am. Plaintiff’s counsel shall give notice to his
client and to Defendants.
 
While the motion to withdraw appears in order, there are
significant hearing dates in the near future and the withdrawal of Plaintiff’s
counsel today could prejudice Plaintiff. 
Accordingly, the Court will consider this motion on the merits on
January 30, 2024, after hearing the other matters.  
 
Background
 
Plaintiff Edmond Durham (“Durham”) filed this action on May
16, 2022 against Defendants, alleging breach of contract related to a property
that Plaintiff rented from Defendants.
 
Counsel filed this motion on December 18, 2023. No party
filed an opposition.    
 

 
Legal Standard
 
An attorney in an action may be changed at any time before
or after judgment or final determination upon the order of the court, upon the
application of either client or attorney, after notice from one to the other.
(CCP § 284(2)).  Rules of Court, rule
3.1362 requires:
 
1.         Notice of
motion and motion to be directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion
and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel Civil form (MC-051));
2.         A
declaration stating in general terms, and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney client relationship, why a motion under CCP
§284(2), is brought instead of filing a consent under CCP §284(1) (made on the
Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel Civil
form (MC-052));
3.         Service of
the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who have
appeared in the case; and
4.         The
proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel Civil form (MC-053)).
 
The motion should be denied if withdrawal would prejudice
the client.  (Rules Prof. Conduct, Rule
3-700(A)(2); Weil & Brown, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial,
9:385.2 (2008); 1 Witkin Cal. Pro., Attorneys §72 (2008).) The motion should be
denied if it will cause undue delay in the proceeding or cause injustice.  (Mandell v. Superior Court (1977) 67
Cal.App.3d 1, 4.) The determination whether to grant or deny an attorney’s
motion to withdraw as counsel of record lies within the sound discretion of the
trial court, having in mind whether such withdrawal might work an injustice in
the handling of the case. (Lempert v. Superior Court (2003) 112
Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173.)  A breakdown in
the attorney-client relationship (or personality clash) is grounds for
withdrawal.  (Estate of Falco
(1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.) An attorney is not limited to withdrawing
from a case for cause and may withdraw when withdrawal can be accomplished
without undue prejudice to the client. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)        
 
Here, counsel has complied with all procedural
requirements.  However, within weeks
there will be significant motion practice, and the Court is concerned about prejudice
to the client.  While the Court is
tentatively inclined to grant the motion to withdraw, it will consider the
motion after hearing the other motions currently set for January 30, 2024.
