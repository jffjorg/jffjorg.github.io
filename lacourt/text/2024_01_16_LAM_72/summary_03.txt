Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant's motion to compel Plaintiff to provide further responses to requests for production (RFP) Nos. 1 and 11, Request for Admission (RFA) No. 20, and Form Interrogatory – Employment (FIE) Nos. 202.1, 203.1, 205.1, and 217.1. The judge orders Plaintiff to provide the requested information within 30 days.

The judge denies Defendant's motion with respect to RFA No. 20, finding that Plaintiff's denial is not inappropriate.

The judge grants Defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $5,475, representing 12 hours of attorney's fees and 3 hours of paralegal fees.

The judge's ruling is based on the parties' respective positions, including their filings and meet-and-confer process. The judge finds that Defendant's requests for production and form interrogatories are eminently reasonable, and that Plaintiff's failure to provide responsive discovery is unjustified.
