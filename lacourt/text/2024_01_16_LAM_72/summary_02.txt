And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a Judge regarding a hearing on January 16, 2024. The case concerns a dispute between plaintiffs Jaime Scherer and Scott Potter (collectively "Plaintiffs") and defendant Zaki Mansour over a residential lease. The Plaintiffs demurred to the Defendant's amended answer, arguing that it did not state a cause of action. However, the Court finds that the Defendant has pled sufficient ultimate facts to support the affirmative defenses at the pleading stage, and therefore overrules the demurrer. The Court notes that the Plaintiffs' demurrer fails to specifically identify any affirmative defenses that are deficient, and that the Defendant has corrected the deficiencies identified in a previous demurrer by adding factual allegations to the affirmative defenses.
