And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lawsuit filed by Jaime Padilla and Beckie Padilla against Secard Pools. The plaintiffs allege that the defendant misrepresented the warranties on a swimming pool they purchased and failed to repair or replace the pool when it developed defects. The defendant demurred to the complaint, arguing that the plaintiffs had failed to state a claim.

The judge has overruled the defendant's demurrer as to the first, second, third, and sixth causes of action, finding that the plaintiffs have adequately alleged that the defendant's representations and conduct surrounding the warranties were deceptive or misleading. The judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend as to the fourth and fifth causes of action, finding that the plaintiffs have not adequately pled fraud and negligence.

The judge has noted that Civil Code section 1791.2 does not contain the requirement that warranties be provided at the time the contract is made, and has found that the defendant's conduct could have been misleading as a matter of law. The judge has allowed the plaintiffs to file a second amended complaint within 20 days of the issuance of the order.
