Case Summary:
This is a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Defendant DP Care, Inc. dba Casa Valle to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Plaintiffs Jamshid Nazarian, Carineh Nazarian, and Gohar Nazarian. The court considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with this motion. The FAC alleges causes of action for elder abuse, negligence, wrongful death, medical battery, and false imprisonment. The court overrules the demurrer to the First Cause of Action for elder abuse, finding the allegations sufficient to demonstrate physical abuse by an unreasonable physical constraint. The court strikes the Third and Fourth Causes of Action for medical battery and false imprisonment, respectively, as they exceed the scope of the court's prior order. The court denies the motion to strike the requests for punitive damages and attorney fees, finding the allegations sufficient to demonstrate Defendant's malice, recklessness, or oppression.
