English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer of Defendants to the fifth, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth causes of action in the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) with 20 days leave to amend. The Court finds that the gravamen of the fifth, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh causes of action are the three-day notice to perform or quit and the commencement of the unlawful detainer action. The Court also sustains the demurrer of Defendants to the twelfth and thirteenth causes of action, finding that the twelfth cause of action does not state a cause of action for violation of Los Angeles Municipal Code section 49.99.2 and that the thirteenth cause of action does not allege a fiduciary duty between the parties. The Court allows the Plaintiff an opportunity to amend the SAC, but warns that if the amendment is deemed insufficient on demurrer, the Court may sustain the demurrer without leave to amend.
