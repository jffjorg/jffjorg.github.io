And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Stephen M. Garcia and Garcia & Artigliere, counsel for plaintiff Josalyn Pitcher. The motion is unopposed, but the court notes that it is incomplete because the proof of personal service was not filed within five days before the hearing. Additionally, the court notes that there is a discrepancy between the scheduled time for the hearing in the notice and the actual time for the hearing. The court finds that the motion to be relieved as counsel is sufficient grounds for withdrawal due to irreconcilable differences between the counsel and the client, but denies the motion without prejudice due to the incomplete filing.
