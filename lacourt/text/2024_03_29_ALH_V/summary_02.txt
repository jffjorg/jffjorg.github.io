And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Peter A. Hosharian, Esq., counsel for plaintiff Donovan Castillo Mohlman. The motion is unopposed and is based on a conflict between Counsel and Plaintiff. The judge notes that while an attorney need not and should not reveal any confidential information in moving to be relieved as counsel, the mere statement that there is a conflict by itself is not enough. The judge also notes that paragraph 7, subdivision (a), of the proposed order submitted by Counsel is incomplete, as it does not contain the time or place of the next scheduled hearing. Based on these grounds, the judge denies the motion to be relieved as counsel without prejudice.
