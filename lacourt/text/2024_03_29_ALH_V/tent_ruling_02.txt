Hosharian, Esq., counsel for Plaintiff Donovan Castillo Mohlman  RESPONDING PARTY:   None Motion to be Relieved as Counsel The court considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion. No other papers were filed.  BACKGROUND This is a personal injury action filed on June 8, 2023, by plaintiff Donovan Castillo Mohlman (Plaintiff) against defendant City of Burbank (Defendant) and Does 1 through 50, alleging one cause of action for dangerous condition of public property. On February 16, 2024, Peter A. Hosharian, Esq., counsel for Plaintiff, filed a motion to be relieved as counsel. The motion is unopposed.  LEGAL STANDARD The Court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted, provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.) A motion to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the client and on all parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).)  Grounds for permitting an attorney to withdraw from representation include the client’s conduct that “renders it unreasonably difficult for the lawyer to carry out the representation effectively[.]” (Cal. Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 1.16, subd. (b)(4).) A breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is also grounds for allowing the attorney to withdraw. (Estate of Falco¿(1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.)  DISCUSSION Hosharian moves to be relieved as counsel on the grounds that a conflict exists between Counsel and Plaintiff. (Hosharian Decl., ¶ 2.) Although an attorney need not and should not reveal any confidential information in moving to be relieved as counsel, (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (c)), the mere statement that there is a conflict by itself is not enough. “The trial court need not ‘accept a sweeping claim of conflict and 'rubber stamp' counsel's request to withdraw.’ [Citation.] … The trial court still has a duty to explore the conflict, and counsel has a corresponding duty to respond, and to describe the general nature, as fully as possible but within the confines of privilege.’ [Citation.]" (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133-1134.) Additionally, the Court notes that paragraph 7, subdivision (a), of the proposed order that Counsel submitted is incomplete, as it does not contain the time or place of the next scheduled hearing. (See Proposed Order, ¶ 7, subd. (a).) Upcoming hearings, including the hearing was scheduled following Counsel’s filing of this motion, namely the Status Conference re: Mediation on June 26, 2024 at 8:30 a.m., must be included in the final order. Based on the foregoing, the court DENIES the motion to be relieved as counsel without prejudice.
