And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the motion to compel initial responses from the plaintiff. The plaintiff failed to respond to the defendant's discovery requests, including interrogatories, requests for production, and special interrogatories, despite the statutory deadline. The defendant served these requests on January 22, 2024, and July 24, 2024, but the plaintiff did not respond. The Court finds that the plaintiff did not act with substantial justification and orders the plaintiff to provide complete and verified responses to the defendant's discovery requests within 20 days. Additionally, the Court deems the contents of the defendant's requests for admissions as admitted. The Court also awards the defendant $3,500 in sanctions for the failure to respond to discovery requests.
