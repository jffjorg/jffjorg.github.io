CASE NO./NAME: 21STCV27787 JEHAN ZEB MIR vs
LOREN JACOB GOLDMAN, et al.
Moving Party: Plaintiff
Responding Party: Defendants
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: DENIED
 
Background
On November 13, 2002,
Judge Josh M. Fredricks declared Jehan Zeb Mir a vexatious litigant in Los
Angeles Superior Court Case No. TC015566 (Mir v. Law Office of Rushfeld,
Shelley & Drake, et al.). Pursuant to this designation, Mir is subject
to the prefiling requirements under California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) §
391.7. This order requires him to obtain permission from the presiding judge
before filing new litigation, whether acting in propria persona or through
counsel.
Application to Vacate
Prefiling Order
On July 13, 2022, Judge
David J. Cowan, presiding in Department 1, received an Application to Vacate
Prefiling Order and Remove Plaintiff/Petitioner from the Judicial Council
Vexatious Litigant List (Form VL-120) filed by Mir in propria persona. Mir sought
removal from the vexatious litigant list. On August 22, 2022, Judge Cowan
denied the application.
On September 2, 2022,
Mir submitted a Motion to Reconsider the August 22, 2022 Order Denying
Application to Vacate Prefiling Order. On November 16, 2022, Judge Cowan
referred the Motion to Reconsider to Judge Elaine Lu for determination.
Dismissal of
Plaintiff’s Cases
On September 6, 2022,
Judge Cowan accepted a peremptory challenge in Cases 21STCV27787, 2INWCV00424,
21STCV03643, and 20STCV17339, reassigning these matters to Judge Elaine Lu. On
September 13, 2022, Judge Lu dismissed all four civil cases. On September 22
and 26, 2022, the plaintiff filed motions for reconsideration in each dismissed
case. 
On December 7, 2022, filed
a document entitled “Objections to Judge Cowan’s Orders Dated August 22;
November 16, 2022” and “Peremptory Challenge Declaration.”  In that document, Plaintiff “respectfully
requested that Hon. Judge Lu to not rule on the Application to Vacate Prefiling
Order, which is a separate Application made by Plaintiff and has nothing to do
with ‘OSC’ issued by the Court.  In the
alternative, Plaintiff requests Hon. Judge Lu to disqualify herself pursuant to
CCP” [sic] 170.6 to rule on the Application to Vacate Prefiling Order.”
On January 18, 2023,
Judge Lu issued an order denying Plaintiff’s various motions for
reconsideration as to Judge Cowen’s August 22, 2022 order and Judge Lu’s
September 13, 2022 order.  Within that
order, she denied Plaintiff’s peremptory challenges to the four cases before
her, including this one, but she granted the challenge as to the Pre-filing
Order issue.  
On June 17, 2024, the
plaintiff moved the court to correct an alleged clerical error in the online
Register of Actions. On October 23, 2024, the court denied the motion, finding
that the plaintiff was not requesting correction of a clerical error but rather
disputing a judicial error, which falls outside the scope of CCP § 473(d).
Plaintiff now moves the court to reconsider its October 23, 2024, decision, arguing
that Judge Lu’s prior decision to dismiss the case was void, and therefore
Plaintiff’s motion to fix clerical error was proper under CCP § 473(d). Plaintiff
also filed a motion to vacate, similarly contending that Judge Lu’s prior
dismissal order was void.


Discussion
The present motions
concern Judge Lu’s January 18, 2023, ruling on Plaintiff’s various motions for
reconsideration. Plaintiff  argues that
Judge Lu, in her order, improperly retained jurisdiction after accepting the
plaintiff’s peremptory challenge, thereby lacking jurisdiction to rule on the
motion to reconsider her September 13, 2022, order dismissing the cases.
The January 18, 2023,
order discusses Plaintiff’s peremptory challenges to both Judge Cowan’s August
22, 2022, order and Judge Lu’s September 13, 2022, order. Specifically, the
order states:
“Plaintiff’s peremptory challenge is
untimely. First, Plaintiff already used his 170.6 challenge in each of the four
cases on 8/31/22 against Judge Cowan, who accepted the challenge on September
6, 2022 then reassigned the four OSCs to this Court. Moreover, “[a] challenge
under 170.6 is untimely where, as here, it was filed between the issuance of an
order by the court and a hearing on a motion to reconsider that same order.” (Vaienta
v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1465, 1467, fn. 1 [citing
Buchanan v. Buchanan (1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 587, 594-595]). Accordingly,
Plaintiff's peremptory challenge in case numbers 21NWCV0C424, 21STCV27787, |
21STCV03643 and 20STCV 17339 is DENIED as untimely.” (Order Re: Plaintiff’s
Motions for Reconsideration of the August 22, 2022, and September 13, 2022,
Orders.) 
"Insofar as Plaintiff seeks to
disqualify this Court from hearing his motion for reconsideration of Judge
Cowan’s August 22, 2022, order, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s peremptory
challenge is timely. Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration of Judge Cowan’s
August 22, 2022, order will be referred to Department 1 (the Honorable Michelle
Williams Court, Supervising Judge of Civil) for reassignment.” (Id.)
The January 18, 2023,
order is unequivocal that the Court did not accept Plaintiff’s peremptory
challenge regarding its September 13, 2022, order. However, Plaintiff argues
that when Judge Lu accepted Plaintiff’s peremptory challenge as to Judge
Cowan’s August 22, 2022, order, she was thereafter barred from issuing any
further orders in the case. Plaintiff cites Ziesmer v. Superior Court
(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 360, 364, which states: “When a challenge is timely
and properly made, the challenged judge immediately loses jurisdiction and
must recuse himself. If he does not, his subsequent orders and judgments are
void.” 
Plaintiff’s arguments fail
for two primary reasons:
First, the Court’s
decision on Plaintiff’s motion to reconsider its September 13, 2022, order is
not a subsequent order issued after Judge Lu allegedly accepted
Plaintiff’s peremptory challenge to Judge Cowan’s August 22, 2022, order. The
January 18, 2023, order makes it clear that the acceptance of the peremptory
challenge regarding the August 22, 2022, order occurred within the same ruling
and was not issued afterward. It is clear from the order itself that Judge Lu
did not accept the peremptory challenge until after rendering her decision on
Plaintiff’s motion to reconsider the Court’s September 13, 2022, decision.
Second, Judge Cowan’s
August 22, 2022, order dealt solely with Plaintiff’s Application to Vacate the
Prefiling Order and Remove Plaintiff from the Judicial Council Vexatious
Litigant List, a procedural issue under CCP § 391.7. This prefiling requirement
stems from the November 13, 2002, decision declaring Plaintiff a vexatious
litigant, which has remained in effect for over two decades. The application to
vacate the prefiling order involved a general procedural determination about
whether Plaintiff had demonstrated a change in circumstances warranting removal
from the list. It did not involve the merits of any of the underlying cases. In
contrast, Judge Lu’s September 6, 2022, order required the Court to evaluate
the merits of the individual cases at issue. Therefore, Judge Lu’s recusal was
limited solely to the procedural determination regarding the reconsideration of
Judge Cowan’s August 22, 2022, order addressing Plaintiff’s vexatious litigant
status. That is consistent with what Plaintiff requested in his December 7
peremptory challenge.  This recusal did
not extend to or affect her authority to rule on Plaintiff’s motions for
reconsideration of the Court’s September 13, 2022, decision to dismiss the four
cases at issue. 
Further, as to the
clerical error motion, Plaintiff’s request is clearly not focused on any
clerical error.  Rather, it is based on
substance: whether or not Judge Lu had jurisdiction when she made her
orders.  
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s motions are denied.
