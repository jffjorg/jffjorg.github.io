Legal Standard
 
CCP § 664.6 states: “If parties to pending
litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence
of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof,
the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over
the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of
the settlement.”¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿ 
Strict compliance with the statutory
requirements is necessary before a court can enforce a settlement agreement
under this statute.¿ (Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 30, 37.)¿ To
enforce a written settlement agreement under CCP section 664.6, the following
three elements must be met: (1) the parties must have come to a meeting of the
minds on all material points; (2) there must be a writing that contains the
material terms of the agreement; and (3) the writing must be signed by the
parties.¿ (Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998)
60 Cal.App.4th 793, 797-98.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿ 
CCP § 664.6 “require[s] the signatures of the
parties seeking to enforce the agreement under [Code of Civil Procedure]
section 664.6 and against whom the agreement is sought to be enforced.”¿ (J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v. Fair (2014) 232
Cal.App.4th 974, 985.)¿ CCP §
664.6’s “requirement of a ‘writing signed by the parties’ must be read to apply
to all parties bringing the section 664.6 motion and against whom the motion is
directed.”¿ (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999)
74 Cal.App.4th 299, 306; see Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman
Const., Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 35-37 [“A written settlement
agreement is not enforceable under section 664.6 unless it is signed by all of
the parties to the agreement, not merely the parties against whom the agreement
is sought to be enforced.”].)¿ “A
procedure in which a settlement is evidenced by one writing signed by both
sides minimizes the possibility of … dispute[s] and legitimizes the summary
nature of the section 664.6 procedure.”¿ (Robertson
v. Chen (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1290, 1293.)

Discussion
On May 12, 2020,
Plaintiff filed the present suit against Defendant Jesus Gaspar seeking
property damages in the sum of $56,663.58.
On January 11, 2022,
the parties entered into a written Stipulation for Entry of Judgment, in which
Defendant agreed to have judgment entered in Plaintiff’s favor in the amount of
$42,000.00. Under the terms of the stipulation, this obligation would be discharged
if Defendant paid $28,050.00. Of that amount, $17,050.00 was to be paid by
Defendant’s insurance carrier, Farmers Insurance Company, with the remaining
$11,000.00 to be paid by Defendant directly, consisting of a $500.00 lump sum
followed by monthly payments until the balance was satisfied.
Farmers Insurance
Company paid $17,050.00, representing Defendant’s policy limits. However,
Defendant only made payments totaling $1,450.00, leaving a balance of
$9,550.00. Defendant’s last payment was made on April 20, 2024.
On July 25, 2024,
Plaintiff sent Defendant a default payment letter, advising Defendant of the
default. Despite this notice, Defendant failed to make any further payments and
did not cure the default as required under the stipulation.
Plaintiff now moves the
Court to set aside the dismissal of this case and to enter judgment pursuant to
the parties’ stipulation, in favor of Plaintiff, for the stipulated amount of
$42,000.00, less payments received totaling $18,500.00, leaving a balance of
$23,500.00. Plaintiff also seeks $75.00 in costs for filing this motion, for a
total of $23,575.00. Defendant did not file an opposition.
When the case was
dismissed on May 12, 2022, the Court retained jurisdiction to enforce the
settlement under section 664.6; thus, there is no need to set aside the
dismissal and that aspect of the motion is denied. However, all requirements to
enforce the settlement have been met. There was a meeting of the minds on all
material terms, including the amount, scope, and payment terms of the
settlement. The parties signed and filed a stipulation containing all the
material terms. The stipulation/agreement is signed by all parties. Thus, the
Court grants the present motion in part and enters judgment in the amount of
$23,575.00 against Defendant Jesus Alfonso Franco Gaspar.
