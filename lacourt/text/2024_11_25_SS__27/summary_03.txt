And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a denial of the plaintiff's motions to vacate the prefiling order and to reconsider the dismissal of the four civil cases. The plaintiff, Jehan Zeb Mir, was declared a vexatious litigant in 2002 and has been subject to prefiling requirements under California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 391.7. The plaintiff has filed numerous motions, including motions to reconsider and to vacate, but the court has denied all of them.

The plaintiff argues that the court lacks jurisdiction to rule on his motions and that the court's orders are void due to alleged lack of jurisdiction. However, the court finds that the plaintiff's arguments are without merit. The court notes that the plaintiff's peremptory challenge was untimely and that the court did not accept the challenge until after rendering its decision on the plaintiff's motion to reconsider.

The court also finds that Judge Lu did not accept the plaintiff's peremptory challenge until after rendering her decision on the plaintiff's motion to reconsider the court's September 13, 2022, decision. Therefore, the court's recusal was limited solely to the procedural determination regarding the reconsideration of Judge Cowan's August 22, 2022, order addressing the plaintiff's vexatious litigant status.
