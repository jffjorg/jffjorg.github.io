And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court will hear from counsel regarding a motion to be relieved as counsel for Cross Defendant Logistics Academy. The motion is unopposed and was filed by Bradford Hughes, who represents Logistics Academy. Hughes cites an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship as the reason for his request to withdraw.

The court notes that it has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, provided that there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. The court also notes that a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is grounds for allowing the attorney to withdraw.

The court will discuss the motion with counsel and will consider the circumstances surrounding the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The court will also consider who will be representing Logistics Academy moving forward, as a corporate entity cannot appear without counsel.

The next hearing is a status conference scheduled for December 16, 2024, and a final status conference is scheduled for February 5, 2025.
