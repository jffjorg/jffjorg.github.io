The Honorable Judge Lee S. Arian has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Salomy Lee vs. Kevin Alfrdo Espinoza, et al. (Case No. 23STCV29900). The case concerns a motion by Attorney Gary Dordick to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiff, citing an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The motion is unopposed.

The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, as long as there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. The court finds that the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is proper grounds for withdrawal.

The court has set a non-appearance case review for December 9, 2024, to address a request for entry of default filed by the plaintiff on November 21, 2024. The court will discuss the motion to withdraw with counsel at the hearing on November 25, 2024.
