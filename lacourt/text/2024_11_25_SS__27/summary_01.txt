And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case and to enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff for $23,575.00. The plaintiff and defendant had entered into a written stipulation for entry of judgment, in which the defendant agreed to have judgment entered in the plaintiff's favor in the amount of $42,000.00. The defendant failed to comply with the settlement terms, and the plaintiff seeks to enforce the settlement. The judge has found that all requirements to enforce the settlement have been met, including a meeting of the minds on all material terms, a writing that contains the material terms of the agreement, and the signing of the agreement by all parties. The judge has denied the defendant's failure to set aside the dismissal, as the court had retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement under CCP ยง 664.6.
