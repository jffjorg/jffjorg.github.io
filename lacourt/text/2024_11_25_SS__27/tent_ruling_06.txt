CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV29900
SALOMY LEE vs KEVIN ALFRDO ESPINOZA, et al.
Moving Party: Plaintiff’s Counsel Gary
Dordick
Responding Party: Unopposed  
Notice: Sufficient  
  
Ruling: COURT WILL HEAR ARGUMENT 
 
 
Background 
 
Attorney Gary Dordick represents Plaintiff.
Dordick moves to be relieved as counsel, citing an irremediable breakdown in
the attorney-client relationship. No opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard¿ 
¿ 
The Court has discretion to allow
an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that
there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process
of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.) 
¿ 
A motion to be relieved as counsel
must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion),
MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the
client and on all parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).) 
¿ 
Analysis and Conclusion¿ 
¿ 
Dordick has filed Judicial Council
Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order). 
Dordick seeks to be relieved as
counsel for Plaintiff on the grounds that there has been a breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship. The Court finds this to be proper grounds for
withdrawal. (See Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014 (a
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is grounds for allowing the
attorney to withdraw).)  
 
Dordick confirmed Plaintiff's
address as current within the past 30 days by counsel via phone call.  As such, the motion to withdraw is
substantively sufficient.  
 
However, on November 21, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a Request for Entry of Default and a Declaration regarding that
Request.  To provide the Court time to
address that filing, the Court sets a Non-Appearance Case Review re Entry of Default for December
9, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. and will discuss this motion to withdraw with
counsel at today’s hearing.
