CASE NO./NAME: 21STCV08885
ERNESTO RIVERA, AN INDIVIDUAL vs BIMBO BAKERIES USA, INC.
Moving Party: Cross Defendant’s
Counsel Bradford Hughes
Responding Party: Unopposed  
Notice: Sufficient  
  
Ruling: COURT WILL HEAR FROM
COUNSEL RE MOTION  
 
 
Background 
 
Attorney Bradford Hughes
represents Cross Defendant Logistics Academy. Hughes moves to be relieved as
counsel, citing an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.
No opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard¿ 
¿ 
The Court has discretion to allow
an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that
there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process
of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.) 
¿ 
A motion to be relieved as counsel
must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion),
MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the
client and on all parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).) 
¿ 
Analysis and Conclusion¿ 
¿ 
Hughes has
filed Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052
(Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order).  Hughes has indicated that Logistics Academy’s address was confirmed as current
within the past 30 days by counsel via email.
 
Hughes seeks to be relieved as
counsel for Logistics Academy on the grounds that there has been a breakdown in
the attorney-client relationship. The Court finds this to be proper grounds for
withdrawal. (See Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014 (a
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is grounds for allowing the
attorney to withdraw).)   
 
The next hearing is a Status
Conference Re: New Representation for On Time Express and an Order to Show
Cause Re: Sanctions in the Amount of $1,001 against Logistics Academy’s Counsel
for Failure to Appear on October 28, 2024, set for December 16, 2024. 
 
The status conference does not pertain to
Cross-Defendant Logistic Academy. Maryam Danishwar, Hughes’ colleague and named
counsel in this case, has filed a declaration explaining the circumstances
leading to her failure to appear at the October 28, 2024, OSC. 
 
The next hearing after that is a Final Status
Conference, scheduled for February 5, 2025, which provides sufficient time for Cross
Defendant to retain new counsel. If it or newly retained counsel requires
additional time to prepare for trial, there is ample opportunity to seek a
continuance.  However, before granting
this motion, the Court would like information about who will be representing Logistic
Academy moving forward since a corporate entity cannot appear without counsel.
 
Accordingly, the Court will discuss the present motion with
counsel.
