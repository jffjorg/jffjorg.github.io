And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Los Angeles has filed a motion for a protective order to avoid responding to certain discovery requests served by Plaintiff Charles Pierson. The court has granted the motion. The request for a protective order is not untimely, and the court finds that the City has shown good cause to spare it from "unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense." The City argues that the discovery requests are cumulative, harassing, and burdensome, and that it has responded to prior discovery requests without the need for a court order. The court agrees that the City has shown good cause, and that the discovery requests are facially cumulative and harassing. The court notes that the Plaintiff's discovery requests are excessive and do not justify the burden and expense of responding to them. Therefore, the court grants the City's motion for a protective order.
