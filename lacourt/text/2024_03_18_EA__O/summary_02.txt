And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the parties' motions for summary judgment and is focused on the legal issues presented. The judge notes that the parties' arguments are largely based on inferences rather than disputed facts. The judge also notes that Avalon's opposition to the motion for summary judgment is based on speculation and conjecture, which is insufficient to create a triable issue of material fact. The judge cites several cases to support this conclusion, including Seibert Sec. Servs., Inc. v. Superior Court and Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. The judge also notes that documents attached to and incorporated within a complaint become part of the complaint and can supply the ultimate facts required to state the cause of action. Finally, the judge concludes that the plaintiff's opposition to the motion for summary judgment is based on thin air and that the plaintiff must show that the inferences favorable to it are more reasonable or probable than those against it.
