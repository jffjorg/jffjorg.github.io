And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by defendant Avalon Management Group, Inc. as to the negligence cause of action. The court has also granted the motion for summary adjudication filed by Avalon as to the accounting cause of action.

The court found that the plaintiffs have not alleged any facts that would support a claim of negligence against Avalon. The court also found that the HOA is the proper party to sue for an accounting, and therefore, the motion for summary adjudication as to the accounting cause of action is granted.

The court's ruling is based on the facts that Khatri's reports were wrong, Tao's assessment was based partly on Khatri's reports, and the City issued a Vacate Order based on the reports. The court found that the plaintiffs' claims of negligence and accounting are not supported by the facts and therefore, the motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication are granted.
