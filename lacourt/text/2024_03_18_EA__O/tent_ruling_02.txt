[1] Due to the numerous filings in this case, the
procedural background only provides the pertinent filings. 


[2] These motions present largely issues
of law rather than fact. This is evidenced by both parties’ heavy focus
on arguments rather than disputing facts. (See also Plaintiffs’
responses to Avalon’s SS noting that most if not all statements even if
disputed are “immaterial.”) Accordingly, the court will not engage in the
standard burden shifting formula required by summary judgment/adjudication. 
 


[3] A judge is not precluded from granting summary
judgment merely because the parties dispute immaterial facts. (Seibert Sec.
Servs., Inc. v. Superior Court (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 394, 404, n. 2.) 
 


[4] Avalon provides various rules as to what constitutes
a material fact. (See Supp. Opp. p. 9:24-28.) However, the pincites do not
correspond with the proceeding cases; thus, it is unclear where those rules are
derived from. 
 


[5] The court acknowledges that it also
commented that Avalon should “presumably ….bear…liability for [its]
failure in disclosing th[e] [Khatri reports] to Plaintiffs” (9/26/23 Final
Ruling, italics added), that was not an affirmative state that Avalon must
and will bear liability.

v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 856-857 [“[C]ourt must
nevertheless determine what any evidence or inference could show or imply to a reasonable
trier of fact …But if the court determines that
all of the evidence presented by the plaintiff, and all of the inferences drawn
therefrom, show and imply [the claim] only as
likely as permissible competition or even less likely, it
must then grant the defendants' motion for summary judgment, even apart from
any evidence presented by the defendants or any inferences drawn therefrom,
because a reasonable trier of fact could not find for the plaintiff.”],
emphasis added.)

1 Cal.App.4th 149, 161 [“When opposition to a motion for summary judgment is based on
inferences, those inferences must be reasonably deducible from the evidence,
and not such as are derived from speculation, conjecture, imagination, or
guesswork.”]; see Advent, Inc. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co. v.
Pittsburgh (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 443, 459 [speculation is not evidence that
can be used in opposing summary judgment]; Collin v. CalPortland Co. (2014)
228 Cal.App.4th 582, 592 [mere possibility that plaintiff was exposed to
defendant’s product is insufficient to create a triable issue of material
fact]; see also Leslie G. v. Perry & Associates (1996) 43
Cal.App.4th 472, 483, emphasis and underline added [“ Since there is no direct
evidence that the rapist entered or departed through the broken gate (or even
that the broken gate was the only way he could have entered or departed), Leslie cannot survive summary
judgment simply because it is possible that
he might have entered through the broken
gate.”]; Alex R. Thomas & Co. v. Mutual Service Cas. Ins. Co. (2002)
98 Cal.App.4th 66, 74 [Insurance Co.
need not disprove alternative causes in the
absence of facts indicating alternative causes might have existed].)
 


[8] Documents
attached to and incorporated within a complaint become part of the complaint. (See Robert E. Weil et al., California
Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial ¶ 6:233 (2023)
[“Exhibits: Plaintiff may attach a copy of a document to the complaint and incorporate it by
reference. By so doing, the documents become part of the complaint as if set forth
verbatim therein. Thus, the contents of the exhibit may supply the ultimate
facts required to state the cause of action.”], citing Del
March Beach Club Owners Ass’n, Inc. v. Imperial Contracting Co., Inc. (1981)
123 Cal.App.3d 898, 908 [“The Association, by reference to the attached
exhibit, clearly and directly incorporated the Declaration of Restrictions in
its entirety….”].)


[9] On this note, in its initial opposition, Plaintiffs
state that Avalon did not patch the holes ones the walls of DBV left by Marcus
Allen and the “holes on the walls were used by Khatri in the 2021 Report.”
(Opp. p. 16:19-23.) However, there is no allegation that this was used
in the Khatri Reports nor any cited thereof. Arguments raised in opposition may
not create issues outside the pleadings. (Hutton v. Fidelity National Title
Co., (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 486, 493.)
 


[10] See Leslie G., supra, 43 Cal.App.4th at p. 483
[“We will not, however, draw
inferences from thin air. Where, as here, the plaintiff seeks to prove an
essential element of her case by circumstantial evidence, she cannot recover
merely by showing that the inferences she draws from those circumstances are consistent with her theory. Instead, she must
show that the inferences favorable to her are more
reasonable or probable than those against her.”], italics
