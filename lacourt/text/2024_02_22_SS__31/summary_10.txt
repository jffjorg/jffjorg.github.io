Here is the summary in English text:

The tentatively ruling grants the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Ameer A. Shah, the attorney of record for Plaintiff Gregory Harker. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, as Mr. Shah was unable to confirm Plaintiff's address or locate a current address after calling Plaintiff's last known telephone number. Despite this, Mr. Shah filed proof of service of the motion, declaration, and proposed order on Plaintiff and Defendant. The court finds that the motion is granted, and the ruling is effective upon filing proof of service of the final order. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit to the ruling, they must email the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
