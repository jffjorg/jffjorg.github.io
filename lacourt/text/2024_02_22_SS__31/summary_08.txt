And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the defendants' motion to continue the trial date from April 4, 2024 to a date on or after March 10, 2025. The defendants filed their motion for summary judgment on December 19, 2023, and the earliest available hearing date for the motion was January 7, 2025, which is after the current trial date. The judge found that there is good cause to continue the trial date as the defendants need time to depose a critical witness and the trial court cannot refuse to hear a summary judgment motion filed within the time limits of CCP ยง 437c. The judge also considered the proximity of the trial date, the length of the continuance requested, and the availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion. The judge ordered the new trial date to be set at 8:30 a.m. on a date to be determined in Department 31 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
