And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the petition to approve the compromise of a pending action of a minor and has made a tentative ruling. The judge finds the settlement of $200,000 fair and reasonable, with $175,000 going to the claimant, Richard Mupenzi, an adult person with a disability. The judge also finds the attorneys' fees fair and reasonable. The judge has found that the proposed trust instrument meets the requirements for a court-created or funded trust and is ready for approval. The judge has also found that the proposed trustee, Monica Mbabazi, does not meet the requirement for a bond, so a bond of $113,000 will be required.

The judge has continued the hearing to require 15 days' notice to the three state agencies and has set an order to require a bond and first trust accounting in one year. The judge has also set an order to require the filing of a Notice of Commencement of Proceedings for a Court Supervised Trust and to open trust supervision action in probate.

The judge has made several corrections to the proposed order, including the bond amount and the fees to SNT counsel. The judge has ordered the petitioner to reserve a new date and file a new petition curing the defects at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.
