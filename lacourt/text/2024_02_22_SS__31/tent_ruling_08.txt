Background On October 6, 2022, plaintiffs Krasimira Kovacheva, Radostin Kovachev, and Estate of Martin Radostinov Kovachev by and through its successor-in-interest Krasimira Kovacheva (“Plaintiffs”) filed this action against defendants, Chandra Bouchard, Krassimir Iordanov, and Veselka Yordanova for the wrongful death of Martin Radostinov. Trial is currently set for April 4, 2024.   Defendants Krassimir Iordanov and Veselka Yordanova (“Defendants”) request the Court to continue the trial date and all related dates to a date on or after March 10, 2025, in order for their motion for summary judgment (“MSJ”) to be heard prior to trial.  Plaintiffs oppose the motion, and Defendants filed a reply.  II. Trial Continuance Although continuances of trials are disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own merits.  (CRC Rule 3.1332(c).)  The Court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance.  (CRC Rule 3.1332(c).) The Court may look to the following factors in determining whether a trial continuance is warranted: (1) proximity of the trial date; (2) whether there was any previous continuance of trial due to any party; (3) the length of the continuance requested; (4) the availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion; (5) the prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance; and (6) whether trial counsel is engaged in another trial.  (See generally, CRC Rule 3.1332(d)(1)-(11).)  Additional factors for the Court to consider include: a party’s excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent efforts; whether all parties have stipulated to a continuance; and any other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or application.  (CRC Rule 3.1332(c), (d).) Defendants asserts they filed their MSJ on December 19, 2023, and the earliest hearing date available for the MSJ was January 7, 2025, which, but that it is after the current trial date. Defendants, thus, seek to continue the trial date to allow their MSJ to be heard.  In opposition, Plaintiff argues the MSJ was strategically filed because Defendants need additional time to depose defendant Chandra Bouchard and another percipient witness, and that a trial continuance is not warranted. However, Plaintiffs alternatively argue that they do not oppose the request to continue discovery deadlines or to set a new trial date, as it would allow Plaintiffs to conduct the necessary discovery to oppose Defendants’ MSJ and to file their own MSJ.   Here, there is a good cause to continue the trial date. Defendants filed their MSJ on December 19, 2023, and a trial court cannot refuse to hear a summary judgment motion filed within the time limits of CCP § 437c. (Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 918. 919.) Furthermore, Defendant filed this motion to continue trial on January 22, 2024, which is two and half months before the current trial date, as opposed to waiting until the eve of trial. There have been no prior requests for a trial continuance, and the case matter is not yet old. There are no alternative means identified to address these issues, and there is otherwise no prejudice shown to any party if trial is continued.   Based on the foregoing, Defendants’ motion to continue trial is GRANTED.  The April 4, 2024 Trial date is continued to ______________ at 8:30 a.m. in Department 31 of the Spring Street Courthouse.  The March 21, 2024 Final Status Conference is continued to _______________ at 10:00 a.m. in Department 31.  All discovery and expert cutoff dates are continued to reflect the new trial date.   Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 21st day of February 2024      Hon.
