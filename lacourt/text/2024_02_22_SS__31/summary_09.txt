  - "A party in a civil case may waive the right to a jury trial under section 631 in several ways, including by failing to deposit jury fees 'on or before the date scheduled for the initial case management conference in the action.'"
  - "The trial court should grant a motion for relief of a jury waiver 'unless, and except, where granting such a motion would work serious hardship to the objecting party.'"
  - "In a motion for relief from waiver of a jury trial, the crucial question is whether the party opposing relief will suffer any prejudice if the court grants relief."
  - "The mere fact that trial will be by jury is not prejudice per se."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's unopposed motion for relief from waiver of jury trial. The plaintiff had failed to post the required jury fees by the deadline, but claims that this was due to a mistake by her counsel. The judge finds that the plaintiff has shown that her counsel mistakenly thought the jury fees had been posted, and that there is no prejudice to any party by granting the motion. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's counsel has now posted the required jury deposit with the court. The motion is granted, and the plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling and file proof of service with the court within five days.
