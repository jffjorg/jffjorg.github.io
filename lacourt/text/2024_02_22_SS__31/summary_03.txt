English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to Temple City's motion for a Protective Order to quash Plaintiff Anne McLellan's notice of the deposition of Samual DeFillippo, Temple City's playground equipment consultant. The Plaintiff alleges that Temple City negligently owned and maintained the jungle gym where she suffered a trip and fall. The City argues that Plaintiff has not identified any objective facts to justify the deposition, and that DeFillippo's opinion lacks foundation. The Court finds that the dispute is distinguishable from St. Mary Medical Center v. Superior Court (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1531, and grants the Protective Order to preclude DeFillippo's deposition under the St. Mary's exception, prior to expert exchange.
