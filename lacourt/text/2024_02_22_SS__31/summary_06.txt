And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion of Fernando D. Vargas, counsel for Michael Paul Miller, Jr., to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The motion is based on irreconcilable differences between the plaintiff and counsel, and counsel's inability to confirm the plaintiff's address or locate a current address. The judge notes that counsel must serve the moving papers on the Clerk of the Court, as required by law, if they are unable to serve the plaintiff at a confirmed address. The motion is denied without prejudice, and counsel is ordered to give notice. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if necessary, to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
