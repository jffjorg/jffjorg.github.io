  - "The anti-SLAPP statute is intended to 'encourage continued participation in matters of public significance'; therefore, it is to be 'construed broadly'."
  - "Plaintiffs argue that 'virtually none of Plaintiffs' causes of action are based on the termination notice or the eviction proceeding'."
  - "Unless the sole basis of liability asserted in the tenant's complaint is the filing and prosecution of the unlawful detainer action, the tenant's action will not be targeted at protected activity."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' special anti-SLAPP motions to strike the plaintiffs' complaint. The defendants argued that the instant action is a retaliatory lawsuit brought by the plaintiffs in response to the unlawful detainer judgment entered in their favor, and that the plaintiffs are collaterally estopped from bringing the instant action. However, the judge found that the plaintiffs' allegations of substandard and defective housing conditions do not arise from the defendants' protected speech activity, and that the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not apply. The judge also noted that the plaintiffs' causes of action are not based on the termination notice or the eviction proceeding, and that the defendants' arguments are contradictory and unreliable. Therefore, the judge denied the motions and allowed the plaintiffs' complaint to proceed.
