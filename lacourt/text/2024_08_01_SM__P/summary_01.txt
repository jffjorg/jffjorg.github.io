And here is the English-text summary:

The Tentative Ruling is for a hearing on August 1, 2024, regarding Defendant Gillion's Motion to Quash Service of Summons due to lack of personal jurisdiction. Gillion, a New York resident, claims she has no affiliations with California, where the plaintiff Altman is based. Altman argues that Gillion purposefully availed herself of California's benefits by soliciting investments from him and communicating with him extensively through phone and email. However, the court finds that the evidence does not establish a connection between Gillion and the agreement, and therefore, Gillion did not purposefully direct her actions to California. The court lacks general jurisdiction over Gillion and finds that Altman has not demonstrated specific jurisdiction over Gillion. The court allows limited discovery to obtain evidence of Gillion's contacts with California and involvement in the transaction.
