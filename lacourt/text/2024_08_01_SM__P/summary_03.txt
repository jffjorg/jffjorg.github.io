Summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to quash service of summons filed by defendant Gillion, claiming lack of personal jurisdiction. Gillion, a New York resident, argues that she has no affiliation with California and did not purposefully avail herself of the state's benefits. Altman, the plaintiff, claims that Gillion solicited investments from him in California and communicated extensively with him through phone and email. However, the judge finds that Altman has failed to demonstrate that Gillion directed her activities towards California and therefore lacks specific jurisdiction over her. The court will allow limited jurisdictional discovery to obtain evidence of Gillion's contacts with California and involvement in the transaction.
