  JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS
 
Date:   January
  31, 2024
Time:  8:30 a.m.
Dept.:  P



 
          
          I.        INTRODUCTION
          This is an action for childhood sexual
assault (CSA). Plaintiff Jane Roe (Roe) alleges that in 2004-2007, while she
was in elementary school, she was sexually assaulted by Defendant Victor
Martinez (Martinez), her teacher. 
          Roe alleges that she was a student at
various elementary schools operated by Defendant Pasadena Unified School
District (PUSD) at the time the CSA occurred. She alleges that she told her
school counselor, Defendant Kelly Montgomery, about the abuse but that the
abuse was not investigated by either Montgomery or PUSD. The second amended
complaint contains eleven causes of action: (1) negligence, (2) negligent
supervision, (3) negligent hiring and/or retention, (4) negligent failure to
warn, train or educate, (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (6)
sexual battery, (7) sexual assault, (8) gender violence, (9) violation of penal
code § 288, (10) violation of penal code § 647.6 and (11) violation of civil
rights. 
          Before the Court is PUSD’s motion for judgment on the
pleadings as to the complaint. PUSD moves for judgment on the pleadings as to
the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 11th
causes of action. 
PUSD
filed the instant motion on January 3, 2024. Plaintiff Jane Roe filed an
opposition on January 18, 2024. PUSD filed a reply on January 24, 2024.
For
the reasons that follow, the motion is granted in part and denied in part. Leave
to amend is granted.
 
          II. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
          Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice:

III.     LEGAL
STANDARD
          Code Civ. Proc. §438 provides for a motion for judgment on
the pleadings. When made by a plaintiff, a motion may be made on the ground
that the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and
the answer does not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense. When the
moving party is the defendant, the motion may be made on either one of two
grounds: the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction; or the complaint does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that defendant. 
          “A defendant may move for judgment on the pleadings on the
ground that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to state a cause of
action against that defendant. (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c)(1)(B)(ii); People
ex rel. Harris v. Pac Anchor Transportation, Inc. (2014) 59 Cal.4th 772,
777.) A motion for judgment on the pleadings ‘is equivalent to a demurrer and
is governed by the same de novo standard of review.’ (Kapsimallis v.
Allstate Ins. Co. (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 667, 672.)” Templo v. State
(2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 730, 735.)
          Code Civ. Proc. §439(a)(2) mandates that five days before
filing a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the parties meet and confer in
person.  
 
          IV.     ANALYSIS
          As briefly summarized in the introduction, the gist of the complaint
as to Defendant PUSD is that it knew of the abuse and did not report it or
otherwise investigate or reprimand the allegedly abusive teacher. Based on that
simple set of facts, the pleading sets forth 11 causes of action. PUSD argues
that  the first, second, third, fourth
and eleventh causes of action do not contain sufficient facts.
          A. AB 218 Does Not Violate the California Constitution
           Here, PUSD urges
that (1) AB 218 violates the gifts clause of the California Constitution and
that necessarily, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th
and 11th causes of action fail as a result. Accordingly, the 1st,
2nd, 3rd, 4th and 11th causes of
action will be discussed together, as the same argument is advanced.
          PUSD urges that AB 218 violates the gifts clause of the California
Constitution. (Motion, p. 10: 11-14.) The Government Claims Act requires that
before a suit is filed against a public entity, a plaintiff must first file a
claim for damages with the public entity itself. (Cal. Gov’t Code § 905.) AB
218 changed Government Code Section 905, to carve out a retroactive exception
to the Government Claims Act for claims of sexual abuse. It is this retroactive
application that PUSD alleges is non-compliant with the California
Constitution. Because this created “liability on a public entity for a past occurrence where there is no enforceable
claim,” which in turn might result in the award of public money if Plaintiff
prevails, PUSD alleges that it is an impermissible gift. (Motion, p. 13: 17-18.)

The
California Constitution limits the spending and allocation of public funds. It
specifically limits the “gift of public money” which includes “all
appropriations of public money for which there is no authority or enforceable
claim, even if there is a moral or equitable obligation” (Cal. Const. Art. XVI,
sec. 6.) In support of its argument, PUSD cites several cases where laws
permitting retroactive payment/liability were deemed unconstitutional by the
California Supreme Court, as to Cal. Const. Art. XVI, sec. 6. (Bourn v. Hart
(1892) 93 Cal. 321, 327-328 [personal injury], Conlin v. Board of
Supervisors (1893) 99 Cal. 17, 21 [nonpayment of a contract], Powell v.
Phelan (1903) 138 Cal. 271, 273-274 [jury fee payment] and Heron v.
Riley (1930) 209 Cal. 507, 517 [automobile accident liability].)
PUSD
urges that Plaintiff Roe did not have an enforceable claim at the time of the
abuse, because she did not submit a government claim at the time. (Motion, p.15:
1-3.) More specifically, PUSD urges “Plaintiff never presented a government
claim to the District, there was never a time in this case prior to 2020 that
all of the elements of a cause of action against the District were satisfied.” (Id.)
In
opposition, Roe urges that AB 218 does not violate the gift clause, as the
changes to Government Code Section 905 clearly serve a public purpose.
(Opposition, p. 8: 26-27.) In support, Roe cites case law for the proposition
that “in determining whether an appropriation of public funds is to be
considered a gift, the primary question is whether the funds are to be used for
a ‘public’ or ‘private’ purpose.” (County of Alameda v. Carleson (1971)
5 Cal.2d 730, 745-46.) Specifically, “the benefit to the state from an
expenditure for a public purpose is in the nature of consideration and the
funds expended are therefore not a gift.” (Id.) The determination as to
what is a public purpose is left to the legislature. (Id. at 746.)  The public purpose need not be stated
directly but may be inferred from the manner in which the legislation was
enacted. (Scott v. State Bd. of Equalization  (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1597, 1604.) 
Roe
argues that “District confuses cases concerning the allocation of money for
claims that previously did not exist, which may violate the gift clause if
there is no important public purpose at issue, with the giving of money for
claims that did exist but have since expired.” (Opposition p. 10: 24-26.) Citing
Chapman v. State, Roe urges that similarly, AB 216 did not create
liability where previously there was none but rather removed a hurdle to
recover for wrong acts. (Chapman v. State (1894) 104 Cal. 690, 696.)
This argument is well taken, as liability for the sexual abuse did exist at the
time it occurred, AB 216 simply removed the claim presentment hurdle. (See
Opposition p. 12: 5-10.) Roe also attempts to distinguish cases cited by PUSD
on factual bases. Roe also cites cases where removing hurdles for childhood
sexual abuse victims to file claims was cited as a public purpose. (Coats v.
New Haven Unified School Dist. (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 415, 422; Liebig v.
Superior Court (1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 828, 834.) Roe urges that the public
purpose has been demonstrated by the legislative history and plain language of
Government Code Section 905, as the Legislature acknowledged the special nature
of childhood sexual abuse cases, by exempting prospective claims from the
Government Claims Act and then, through AB 218, by exempting retrospective
claims. (Opposition p. 17: 1-7.)
Roe
then cites several cases where ‘public purpose’ was broadly defined. (See,
e.g., Veterans’ Welfare Bd. v. Jordan (1922) 189 Cal. 124, 145 [resettlement
as a public purpose]; County of San Diego v. Hammond (1936) 6 Cal. 2d
709, 724 [financial aid to certain groups as a public purpose].) Further, “The
language of the retroactivity provision of section 340.1 indicates a
clear legislative intent to maximize claims of sexual-abuse minor plaintiffs
for as expansive a period of time as possible.” (Liebig v. Superior Court
(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 828, 834.) Additionally, “the law is clear that vested
rights are not immune from retroactive laws when an important state interest is
at stake.” (Id.)
The
Court finds that the public purpose justification is valid and that the
Legislature’s judgment in this regard should be respected.  Accordingly, the Court finds that AB 218 and
the changes to Government Code 905 are not unconstitutional. (See Scott,
supra, at 1605.)
Roe
responds that the alleged sexual abuse was clearly actionable when it occurred,
and that PUSD’s argument regarding the claims requirement focuses on the wrong
consideration.  (Opposition, p. 12-28.)
The Court agrees. Once the Legislature determined that the claims requirement
does not apply to these revival claims, it cannot be used as a shield to
prevent the bringing of the action.  
          The Court also agrees with Plaintiff that she may assert
both a claim for generalized negligence, as well as a specific claim for negligent
supervision, a specific claim for negligent hiring, retention, and supervision and
a specific claim for negligent failure to warn against each defendant.  Each claim will require slightly different
elements to be proven. This does not constitute an impermissible “splitting” of
a cause of action.  
 
          B. Civil Rights 
          The Unruh Civil Rights Act is provided by Civil Code
Section 51 et seq. Civil Code Section 51(b) provides that “[a]ll persons within
the jurisdiction of this state…  are entitled to the full and equal
accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services in all business
establishments of every kind whatsoever.” (CC § 51(b).) The Unruh Civil Rights
Act is intended to remedy traditional wrongs by business establishments.
(Frantz v. Blackwell, 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 96; Stamps v. Superior
Court (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 1441, 1449.) A public entity is not a
business establishment for purposes of the act unless it engages in behavior
constituting sufficient “businesslike attributes.” (Qualified Patients Ass'n
v. City of Anaheim (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 734, 764-765; Taormina v.
California Department of Corrections (S.D.Cal.1996) 946 F.Supp. 829,
833-834.)
          The facts alleged here are with respect to Pasadena Unified
School District, a public entity. Plaintiff Roe asserts that the conduct of
Pasadena Unified School District was in violation of her civil rights under the
Unruh Act. However, as PUSD is a public entity, it cannot be held to account
under the Unruh Act without further identification as to how the public entity
is behaving like a business. (Carter v. City of Los Angeles (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 808 [holding that a public entity City is not a business
establishment for purposes of the Unruh Civil Rights Act], see also Qualified
Patients Ass’n, supra; Taormina, supra.) As the complaint does not
identify how PUSD is behaving for all intents and purposes like a business and thus
qualifies as a business under the Unruh Act, the complaint fails to state a
cause of action for violation of the Unruh Act.
          To the extent that this could be solved on amendment, the
Court notes the possibility that Roe could elucidate sufficient behavior on
part of PUSD as to businesslike attributes. Accordingly, the motion for
judgment on the pleadings is granted with respect to the 11th cause
of action, with leave to amend.
          
 
 
 
 
 
V.       ORDER
          PUSD’s motion for judgment on the pleadings is DENIED as to
the 1st cause of action for negligence, the 2nd cause of
action for negligent supervision, the 3rd cause of cause for
negligent hiring, and the 4th cause of action for failure to warn. The
motion is GRANTED as to the 11th cause of action, with 20 days’ leave
to amend. 
          PUSD is ordered to give notice.
