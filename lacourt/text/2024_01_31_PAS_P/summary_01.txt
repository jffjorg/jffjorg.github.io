Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted in part and denied in part Pasadena Unified School District's (PUSD) motion for judgment on the pleadings. The motion was denied as to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th causes of action for negligence, negligent supervision, negligent hiring and retention, and failure to warn. The motion was granted as to the 11th cause of action, with leave to amend, because the Unruh Civil Rights Act does not apply to PUSD as a public entity.

The judge also ruled that AB 218, which changed the Government Claims Act, does not violate the California Constitution. The judge found that the public purpose justification for the retroactive application of the law is valid and that the Legislature's judgment in this regard should be respected.

The judge also ruled that Jane Roe may assert both a claim for generalized negligence and a specific claim for negligent supervision, hiring, retention, and failure to warn against each defendant. Each claim will require slightly different elements to be proven, and this does not constitute an impermissible "splitting" of a cause of action.

The judge granted PUSD's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the 11th cause of action, with leave to amend, and ordered PUSD to give notice.
