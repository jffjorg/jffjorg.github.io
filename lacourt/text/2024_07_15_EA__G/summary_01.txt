Summary:
The tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Sharine Forbes' motion to enforce the settlement agreement between Forbes and Defendant Shehzad Ahmed. Forbes seeks to have judgment entered against Ahmed for breach of the settlement agreement. However, the court finds that Forbes fails to establish damages as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The court also notes that Forbes has not yet repaid the funds received from PVHC, and the bankruptcy court has filed an adversarial proceeding against Forbes and Forbes' counsel seeking reimbursement of the funds.
