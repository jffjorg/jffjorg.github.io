  Case Number:  22PSCV00060    Hearing Date:   July 15, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Sharine Forbes’s Motion to Enforce
Settlement Agreement
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Sharine Forbes’s Motion to Enforce
Settlement Agreement is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
BACKGROUND
This
is a wrongful termination action. In November 2020, Plaintiff Sharine Forbes
reached out to Defendant Shehzad Ahmed, the chief officer and administrator for
Defendant Pomona Valley Home Care, Inc. (PVHC), and inquired about employment
in the healthcare industry. After discussing a potential position with Forbes,
Ahmed reached out to Forbes on December 7, 2020, and asked whether Forbes had
thought about the position and salary offered. On December 8, 2020, Forbes
accepted Ahmed’s offer and started in the new position on January 22, 2021.
On
February 18, 2021, Forbes decided to resign from employment with PVHC but was
convinced by PVHC’s employees to stay. A few days later, Forbes’s employment
was terminated by PVHC’s management after Forbes had a disagreement with a
fellow employee. Forbes was subsequently rehired and a contract memorializing
the terms of Forbes’s employment was executed on March 1, 2021. On April 1,
2021, Forbes’s employment was terminated after allegedly informing Ahmed that PVHC
had been persistently violating HIPAA laws.
On
January 19, 2022, Forbes filed a complaint against PVHC and Does 1-10, alleging
the following causes of action: (1) breach of employment contract, (2) breach
of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (3) wrongful termination in
violation of public policy, (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress,
(5) false promise, and (6) intentional misrepresentation.
On October
17, 2022, Forbes amended the Complaint to replace Doe 1 with Ahmed.
On April 10,
2203, PVHC filed a notice of bankruptcy filing and entry of automatic stay.
On September
7, 2023, Forbes dismissed the first, second and third causes of action against
Ahmed.
On September
20, 2023, Forbes filed a notice of settlement.
On April 10,
2023, Forbes dismissed Ahmed from the present action.
On June
20, 2024, Forbes filed the present motion. A hearing on the motion is set for
July 15, 2024, with a status conference re: bankruptcy set for July 23, 2024.
ANALYSIS
Forbes
seeks to have judgment entered against Ahmed pursuant to the parties’ settlement
agreement. For the following reasons, the court DENIES the motion.
Legal
Standard
Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides a summary procedure that enables
courts to enforce a settlement agreement by entering a judgment pursuant to the
terms of the parties’ settlement. In relevant part, it provides as follows:
If
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside of the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement
of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment
pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court
may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a).)
A
writing is considered signed if signed by the party or an attorney who
represents the party. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b).)
Discussion
In this case,
Forbes provides a copy of a written
settlement agreement signed by Forbes and Ahmed in September 2023 along with an
amendment signed in April 2024. (Alaric-Lorenzo Decl., Ex. A.) According to the
agreement, Ahmed agreed to pay Forbes a total of $150,000 in monthly payments of at least
$10,000 that commenced on October 25, 2023. (Alaric-Lorenzo Decl., Ex. A, §
2(a).) On May 30, 2024, Forbes’s counsel received an email from the United
States Trustee that demanded Forbes repay $80,000 that Forbes received from
PVHC on Ahmed’s behalf. (Alaric-Lorenzo Decl., ¶ 7.) On June 19, 2024, PVHC
filed an adversarial proceeding in bankruptcy court against Forbes and Forbes’s
counsel, seeking reimbursement of the $80,000. (Alaric-Lorenzo Decl., ¶ 8.)
Forbes now
argues Ahmed breached the settlement agreement by making payments with funds
from PVHC. But Forbes fails to establish damages as the declaration of Forbes’s
counsel does not state (1) if Forbes has actually repaid the funds from PVHC or
(2) if the bankruptcy court has ordered Forbes to repay the funds in PVHC’s
bankruptcy proceedings. While Forbes may be entitled to enforce the settlement
agreement if the funds already paid are lost, Forbes has yet to establish that
has occurred.
Accordingly, Forbes’s
motion is DENIED without prejudice.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the Court
DENIES Forbes’s motion to enforce the settlement agreement between
Forbes and Ahmed.
