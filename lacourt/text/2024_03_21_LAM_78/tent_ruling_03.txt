Plaintiff alleges that he purchased a home after obtaining a mortgage from American Home Mortgage Investment Corp. After the lender filed for bankruptcy, Chase, without consideration, falsely conveyed the deed to a Chase entity called SAM II, a pool of mortgages bundled together by a pooling agreement. In November 2012, Chase initiated nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings against Plaintiff. After Plaintiff transferred the property to Soames Lane Trust, the trust filed for bankruptcy. The bankruptcy court lifted the automatic stay in 2020 and again after the trust filed for bankruptcy a second time. Chase held a foreclosure sale in October 2022. PROCEDURAL HISTORY On October 17, 2022, Plaintiffs Grover Henry Colin Nix, IV and the Soames Lane Trust filed their Complaint against Defendants JPMorgan Chase Bank and the Wilmington Trust, NA.On December 5, 2022, Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint naming additional defendants Structured Asset Mortgage Investment II Trust 2007-AR7, Inc., Elizabeth Newsome, Ro’Quintessa Ledawnika Givens, Katrina Ashton, Krisshune Benjamin, and Carol Cinquemani. On October 31, 2023, Plaintiffs dismissed Defendants Elizabeth Newsom, Ro’Quintessa Ledawnika Givens, Katrina Ashton, Krisshune Tate Benjamin, and Carol Cinquemani from this action.On November 9, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint.On February 22, 2024, JPMorgan Chase Bank filed this motion to quash service of summons. The motion is unopposed.DISCUSSION Defendant JPMorgan Chase (Chase) moves to quash service of summons as to Defendant Structured Asset Mortgage Investment II Trust 2007-AR7 (SAMI II) on the grounds that Chase cannot accept service of summons on behalf of SAMI II and that SAMI II does not exist.Judicial NoticeChase requests judicial notice of the following:1. Deed of trust recorded in Los Angeles County on June 28, 2007 as instrument number 20071552455.2. Corporate assignment of deed of trust recorded in the Official Records of Los Angeles County on October 15, 2012 as instrument number 20121553807.3. Registration, successor appointment and acceptance agreement filed in bankruptcy court in the bankruptcy matter, In re Soames Lane Trust, Case No. 2:21-bk-17932-BB.4. Trustee’s deed upon sale recorded in the Official Records of Los Angeles on December 19, 2022 as instrument number 20221181523.The requests are granted.Legal Standard“A defendant . . . may serve and file a notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes:  (1) To quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her. . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10(a).) The motion must be filed on or before the last day on which the defendant must plead or within any further time that the court may for good cause allow. (Id.)“[C]ompliance with the statutory procedures for service of process is essential to establish personal jurisdiction. [Citation.]” (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444.) “[T]he filing of a proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that the service was proper” but only if it “complies with the statutory requirements regarding such proofs.” (Id. at 1441-1442.) When a defendant moves to quash service of the summons and complaint, the plaintiff has “the burden of proving the facts that did give the court jurisdiction, that is the facts requisite to an effective service.” (Coulston v. Cooper (1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 866, 868.) “A court lacks jurisdiction over a party if there has not been proper service of process.” (Ruttenberg v. Ruttenberg (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 801, 808.)AnalysisHere, Chase argues that service on Chase on behalf of SAMI II was defective because Chase cannot accept service on SAMI II’s behalf and because SAMI II does not exist.Chase provides various recorded documents showing that Plaintiff’s original lender assigned the deed of trust at issue in this action to Citibank, NA, as trustee for SAMI II. (RJN Exh. B) By December 2022, the Wilmington Trust, NA, had succeeded as trustee for SAMI II. (RJN Exh. D.)Plaintiffs served proof of service of summons on SAMI II’s agent CSC Lawyers in January 2023. (Henderson Decl., Exh. 1.) After Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint, Plaintiffs requested that Chase’s counsel accept service on behalf of SAMI II. (Henderson Decl., ¶7.) Chase’s counsel advised that he could not accept on behalf of SAMI II. (Id).) In January 2024, Plaintiffs filed proof of service stating they served SAMI II’s agent for service by serving Chase’s agent for service. (Id., ¶9, Exh. 4.) Although Plaintiff alleges in the SAC that SAMI II is a corporate entity in Delaware, Chase’s counsel performed searches of Delaware’s corporate business registry and could not find an entity by that name. (Id., ¶¶11-14.) Service on SAMI II was defective because Chase is not an agent for service for SAMI II and cannot accept service for SAMI II. Because Chase was not SAMI II’s agent for service, service on SAMI II was defective. The motion to quash service of summons is granted.DATED: March 21, 2024 ____________________________Hon. Jill Feeney Judge of the Superior Court
