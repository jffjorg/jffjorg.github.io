The Judge, Hon. Jill Feeney, has issued a tentative ruling on March 21, 2024, denying the motion for reconsideration filed by Respondents Acuity Consulting Services and Erik Cooper. The motion was filed on September 29, 2023, seeking to reconsider the Court's order on Cooper's proposed settled statement. The Court found that the motion was not based on new or different facts, circumstances, or law, and that Cooper had an opportunity to be heard at the September 28, 2023 hearing. The Court also noted that Cooper's disability accommodation request was granted on November 17, 2022, and that his arguments did not provide a valid reason for reconsideration. Therefore, the motion for reconsideration is denied.
