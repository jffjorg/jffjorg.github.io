Aurelio Aguayo 
 
BACKGROUND
 
On July 18, 2023, Plaintiff State Farm
Mutual Automobile Insurance Company filed a complaint against Defendant Aurelio
Aguayo for negligence. This action arises out of a motor vehicle collision
whereby Plaintiff alleges Defendant negligently operated a vehicle, causing his
vehicle to collide with Plaintiff’s insured. 
 
On August 29, 2023, Defendant filed a
cross-complaint against Plaintiff’s insured, Kristina Grigorian for declaratory
relief and comparative fault, apportionment of fault, and subrogation. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Company’s Motion for an Order Deeming its Requests for Admissions
Served Upon Aurelio Aguayo Admitted is GRANTED. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Company moves for an order deeming its Request for Admissions, Set
One served upon Aurelio Aguayo admitted. Plaintiff also requests an order
imposing monetary sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $660.00. 
 
Where there has been no timely response to a request for admission
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may move
for an order that the truth of any matters specified in the requests and the
genuineness of any documents be deemed admitted, as well as a monetary
sanction. (CCP §2033.280(b).) The party who failed to respond waives any
objections to the demand, unless the court grants that party relief from the
waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially
compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result
of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. (CCP §2033.280(a)(1)-(2).) The
court shall grant the motion “unless it finds that the party to whom the
requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the
motion, a proposed response … in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”
(CCP §2033.280(c); St. Mary v. Sup. Ct. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762,
777-78.)
 
On September 7, 2023, Plaintiff State
Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company served Defendant Aurelio Aguayo its
Request for Admissions, Set One. (Pleasant Decl. ¶2, Exh. A.) After several
extensions, Defendant served unverified responses to Plaintiff’s Request for
Admissions, Set One on December 15, 2023. (Pleasant Decl. ¶3, Exh. B.) On January
10, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel sent a letter to Defense counsel advising that no
verifications for Defendant's responses to Plaintiffs discovery had been
received and requested the verifications be served within 10 days of the date
of the letter. (Pleasant Decl. ¶4, Exh. C.) Plaintiff followed up with
Defendant on January 24, 2024. (Pleasant Decl. ¶5, Exh. D.) However, to this
date, no verified responses have been served. (Pleasant Decl. ¶5.) 
 
In opposition, Defense counsel avers
they have tried to reach out to Defendant for verified responses but have not
been able to get him to cooperate. Regardless, Defense counsel states they
properly objected to all 8 requests based on premature disclosure of expert
witnesses and objections need not be verified.
 
Responses to written discovery are
deemed statutorily compliant even without verifications when the responses
contain objections as well as substantive responses. (Blue Ridge Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 339, 345; Food 4 Less Supermarkets,
Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 651, 657.) However, “[t]he
omission of the verification in the portion of the response containing
fact-specific responses merely renders¿that¿portion of the¿response untimely
and therefore only creates a right to move for orders and sanctions
under¿subdivision (k) of section 2031¿as to those responses¿but does not result
in a waiver of the objections made.” (Food 4 Less Supermarkets, supra,
40 Cal.App.4th at p. 657–658.) As such, the objections stand. As to Defendant’s
responses, to RFA Nos. 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, Defendant states without
waiving said objections, “deny” or “lacks sufficient information to admit or
deny” (the court believes 1 and 4 are not at issue as Defendant admits). These
unverified substantive responses make them untimely. The court has no option
but to grant the motion. 
 
 
The court finds Plaintiffs have failed
to timely respond to Defendant Kamangar’s properly served discovery request.
The court therefore grants Defendant Kamangar’s Motion for Order that Requests
for Admissions (Set One) be Deemed Admitted is GRANTED. 
 
Sanctions
 
Where a party fails to provide a timely
response to requests for admission, “[i]t is mandatory that the court impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the
party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (CCP
§2033.280(c).) 
 
Plaintiff requests $660.00 in sanctions
against Defendant for having to bring this motion. This is for two hours of
work at counsel’s hourly rate of $300 plus the $60 filing fee. (Pleasant Decl.
¶6.)  The court imposes these sanctions
against defendant only, and not against defense counsel.
