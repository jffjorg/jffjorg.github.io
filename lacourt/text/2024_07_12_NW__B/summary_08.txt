Here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is about a subrogation action brought by the Interinsurance Exchange of The Automobile Club against Gilbert Oscar Munoz, who allegedly caused a motor vehicle collision. The plaintiff is seeking court default judgment against Munoz for damages of $38,348.27, plus interest and costs. The court previously denied default judgment due to deficiencies in the plaintiff's filing, including a lack of clarity about the relationship between State Farm and Interinsurance Exchange. The plaintiff has since corrected these deficiencies and filed a new default judgment application, but failed to provide proof of service. As a result, the court is denying the application without prejudice.
