ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
On November 18, 2020, Plaintiff
Calixo Lopez Gaspar (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendants Militos
Bagaryan (“Militos”) and Asatur Bagaryan (“Asatur”) (collectively “Defendants”)
for negligence, arising out of an alleged automobile collision.  On January 22, 2024, pursuant to Plaintiff’s
request, the Court dismissed Defendant Asatur Bagaryan with prejudice. 
 
On May 3, 2024, Defendant Militos filed
the instant Motions as to Plaintiff:
 
(1)  
Motion for Order Compelling Plaintiff’s Responses to
Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Order Imposing Monetary Sanctions;
(2)  
Motion for Order Compelling Plaintiff’s Responses to Special
Interrogatories (Set One) and Order Imposing Monetary Sanctions;
(3)  
Motion for Order Compelling Plaintiff’s Responses to Demand
for Production of Documents (Set One) and Order Imposing Monetary Sanctions;
 
No opposition has been filed to any
of the Motions.
 
On June 5, 2024, the matter was
assigned to Judge Karen Moskowitz in Department B of the Van Nuys Courthouse
East.  Plaintiff was ordered to give
notice to all parties in this action within 10 days of service of this notice
and file proof of service thereof within 12 days of this notice.  The Court notes that Plaintiff has failed to
file proof of service of the Notice of Case Reassignment.
 
II.                
Legal
Standard & Discussion
 
A.     Form and Special Interrogatories
 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260(a).)  If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting
party may move for an order compelling response to the discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(b).)  Once compelled to respond, the party waives
the right to make any objections, including ones based on privilege or
work-product protection.  (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2030.290(a).)  There is no
time limit for a motion to compel responses to interrogatories other than the
cut-off on hearing discovery motions 15 days before trial.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2024.020(a),
2030.290.)  No meet and confer efforts
are required before filing a motion to compel responses to the discovery.  (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)
 
On November 10, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with
Form Interrogatories (Set One).  (Buehler
Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. A.)  Plaintiff did not
serve any responses or request an extension. 
(Ibid. at ¶ 5.) 
Defense counsel attempted to resolve the issue informally by sending
Plaintiff’s counsel an email and requesting responses to the discovery on or
before February 29, 2024.  (Ibid.
at ¶ 6, Ex. B.)  In response, Plaintiff’s
counsel’s office requested a 30-day extension, which was granted.  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 6-8, Exs. C-D.)  Plaintiff did not provide any responses,
thus, defense counsel contacted Plaintiff’s counsel again on March 26 and April
1, 2024.  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 9-10, Exs.
E-F.)  Defense counsel has also followed
up regarding the discovery request by phone, but has not received any responses
to these requests.  (Ibid. at ¶¶
11-12.)  The Court finds that Defendant
has demonstrated that he has propounded form interrogatories on Plaintiff and
Plaintiff has not provided any responses. 
Although Defendant was not obligated to meet and confer with Plaintiff,
defense counsel has attempted to resolve the issue informally.  Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s Motion
for Order Compelling Plaintiff’s Responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One).
 
Furthermore, on November 10, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff
with Special Interrogatories (Set One). 
(Buehler Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. A.) 
Plaintiff did not serve any responses or request an extension.  (Ibid. at ¶ 5.)  Defense counsel attempted to resolve the
issue informally by sending Plaintiff’s counsel an email and requesting
responses to the discovery on or before February 29, 2024.  (Ibid. at ¶ 6, Ex. B.)  In response, Plaintiff’s counsel’s office
requested a 30-day extension, which was granted.  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 6-8, Exs. C-D.)  Plaintiff did not provide any responses,
thus, defense counsel contacted Plaintiff’s counsel again on March 26 and April
1, 2024.  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 9-10, Exs.
E-F.)  Defense counsel has also followed
up regarding the discovery request by phone, but has not received any responses
to these requests.  (Ibid. at ¶¶
11-12.)  The Court finds that Defendant
has demonstrated that he has propounded special interrogatories on Plaintiff
and Plaintiff has not provided any responses. 
Although Defendant was not obligated to meet and confer with Plaintiff,
defense counsel has attempted to resolve the issue informally.  Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s Motion
for Order Compelling Plaintiff’s Responses to Special Interrogatories (Set
One).
 
B.     Requests for Production
 
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.260(a).)  If a party to whom requests for production of
documents is directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting party
may move for an order compelling response to the discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(c).)  The party also waives the right to make any
objections, including ones based on privilege or work-product protection.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(a).)  There is no time limit for a motion to compel
responses to production of documents other than the cut-off on hearing
discovery motions 15 days before trial. 
(Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2024.020(a), 2031.300.)  No meet and confer efforts are required
before filing a motion to compel responses to the discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)
 
On November 10, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with
Demand for Production of Documents (Set One). 
(Buehler Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. A.) 
Plaintiff did not serve any responses or request an extension.  (Ibid. at ¶ 5.)  Defense counsel attempted to resolve the
issue informally by sending Plaintiff’s counsel an email and requesting
responses to the discovery on or before February 29, 2024.  (Ibid. at ¶ 6, Ex. B.)  In response, Plaintiff’s counsel’s office
requested a 30-day extension, which was granted.  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 6-8, Exs. C-D.)  Plaintiff did not provide any responses,
thus, defense counsel contacted Plaintiff’s counsel again on March 26 and April
1, 2024.  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 9-10, Exs.
E-F.)  Defense counsel has also followed
up regarding the discovery request by phone, but has not received any responses
to these requests.  (Ibid. at ¶¶
11-12.)  The Court finds that Defendant
has demonstrated that he has propounded a demand for production of documents on
Plaintiff and Plaintiff has not provided any responses.  Although Defendant was not obligated to meet
and confer with Plaintiff, defense counsel has attempted to resolve the issue
informally.  Accordingly, the Court
GRANTS Defendant’s Motion for Order Compelling Plaintiff’s Responses to
Demand for Production of Documents (Set One).
 
 
 
C.    
Monetary
Sanctions
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030(a) provides, in
pertinent part, that the court may impose a monetary sanction on a party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process to pay the reasonable expenses,
including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone because of that conduct.  Misuse of discovery includes “failing
to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(d)).
 
In addition,
§§ 2030.290 and 2031.300 authorize the Court to
impose monetary sanctions if a party fails to respond to interrogatories and
requests for production.
 
Defendant requests monetary sanctions for each Motion, to
be paid by Plaintiff and/or his attorneys of record, jointly and severally.
 
Defendant requests sanctions for the Motion for
Order Compelling Plaintiff’s Responses to Form Interrogatories in the amount of $874.95 as follows: 2 hours for preparing
the Motion, 1 hour for attending the hearing, at a billing rate of $250 per
hour, and $124.95 in filing fees.  (Buehler
Decl. ¶ 13.)  Given that the Court grants the Motion,
Defendant is entitled to sanctions.  The
Court reduces the sanctions as follows: 1 hour for preparing the Motion and 1
hour for appearing at the hearing, at an hourly rate of $250, plus $124.95 in filing fees, for a total amount of $624.95.
 
Defendant requests sanctions for the Motion for
Order Compelling Plaintiff’s Responses to Special Interrogatories in the amount of $874.95 as follows: 2 hours for preparing
the Motion, 1 hour for attending the hearing, at a billing rate of $250 per
hour, and $124.95 in filing fees. 
(Buehler Decl. ¶
13.)  Given that the Court grants the
Motion, Defendant is entitled to sanctions. 
The Court reduces the sanctions as follows: 1 hour for preparing the
Motion and 1 hour for appearing at the hearing, at an hourly rate of $250, plus
$124.95 in filing fees, for a total amount of $624.95.

(Buehler Decl. ¶
13.)  Given that the Court grants the
Motion, Defendant is entitled to sanctions. 
The Court reduces the sanctions as follows: 1 hour for preparing the
Motion and 1 hour for appearing at the hearing, at an hourly rate of $250, plus
$124.95 in filing fees, for a total amount of $624.95.
 
Defendant’s request for monetary
sanctions is granted in the amount of $624.95 for each discovery Motion, for a
total of $1,874.85, to be paid by Plaintiff and his attorneys of record.
 
The Court also notes that Defendant
requests a dismissal of the lawsuit with prejudice due to Plaintiff’s failure
to respond to the discovery requests. 
The Court does not find it appropriate to dismiss the Complaint – in
effect a terminating sanction - based on the instant Motions.
