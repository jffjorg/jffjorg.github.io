```

And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling by the Judge denies the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice due to several deficiencies. The plaintiff had previously submitted a request for court judgment against some defendants but not others, and had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support the damages claimed. The plaintiff had also failed to provide a declaration regarding the attorney fees requested and had not filed a Statement of Damages. The Judge grants judgment against the defendants Down and Out Bar, Rudy Alberto Rayo, Jennifer Saavedra, and Lydia Rodriguez in the amount of $1,405,686.14, but orders the plaintiff to correct the deficiencies before the court will consider the application again.
