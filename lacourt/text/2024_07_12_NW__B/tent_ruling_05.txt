Responding
Party:       Plaintiff Kimberly Anguiano
                                    
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Kimberly Anguiano alleges that she was “attacked,
mauled and bitten” by four dogs owned by defendant Pedro Antonio Romero, at
real property located at 4865 West 133rd Street in Hawthorne, California, owned
by moving defendant Miguel Casillas.  Plaintiff
alleges Defendants Casillas and Romero had an agreement whereby Romero rented
part of the 4865 West 133rd Street property to plaintiff, and that Defendants
were in a joint venture and/or partnership to do so. 
 
Plaintiff filed her complaint on October 14, 2021, alleging
causes of action for: 
(1)  
strict liability under Civil Code
section 3342; 
(2)  
strict liability for failure to remove
known danger under Civil Code section 3342.5; 
(3)  
negligence per se; 
(4)  
negligence (joint venture and/or
commercial agreement) based on Casillas’ actual or constructive knowledge of
the vicious propensity of defendant Romero’s dogs; 
(5)  
premises liability based on the same
allegation that defendant Casillas had actual or constructive knowledge of the
vicious propensity of defendant Romero’s dogs; 
(6)  
intentional infliction of emotional
distress based on the same agreement and alleged actual or constructive knowledge
by Casillas of the vicious propensity of defendant Romero’s dogs;  
(7)  
common law strict liability; and 
(8)  
punitive damages. 
 
Defendant Casillas moves for summary adjudication on each of
the causes of action alleged against him which include the fourth, fifth and
sixth causes of action, and for summary judgment.
 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
GRANT
 
Burden on Summary Judgment or Summary Adjudication
 
In reviewing a motion for summary judgment, the Court must
apply a three-step analysis: (1) identify the issues framed by the pleadings;
(2) determine whether the moving party has met his or her initial burden; and
(3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a
triable, material factual issue. 
(Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal. App. 4th 289,
294.)  “[T]he initial burden is always on
the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no triable issues
of material fact.”  (Scalf v. D.B. Log
Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal. App. 4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant moving for
summary judgment or summary adjudication has met his or her burden of showing
that a cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more
elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a
complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c, subd.
(p)(2).)
 
A moving defendant may satisfy the initial burden to show
that one or more elements cannot be established by “presenting evidence that
conclusively negates an element of the plaintiff's cause of action or by
relying on the plaintiff's factually devoid discovery responses to show that
the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, evidence to
establish that element.” (Schmidt v. Citibank, N.A. (2018) 28
Cal.App.5th 1109, 1119; Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001)
25 Cal.4th 826, 856 [It is insufficient for the defendant to merely point out
the absence of evidence.]; Gaggero v. Yura (2003) 108 Cal. App. 4th 884,
891.) The defendant must present evidence, typically in the form of factually
devoid discovery responses, showing that plaintiff does not have and cannot
reasonably obtain evidence to support his or her claim.” (Ibid.)
 
Unless and until a defendant meets that burden, the
plaintiff has no burden to present controverting evidence. (Consumer Cause,
Inc. v. SmileCare (2001) 91 Cal. App. 4th 454, 468 [“There is no obligation
on the opposing party . . . to establish anything by affidavit unless and until
the moving party has by affidavit stated facts establishing every element . . .
necessary to sustain a judgment in his favor.”].) If a defendant fails to meet
that burden, summary judgment must be denied, even if the plaintiff fails to
file an opposition and fails to proffer any evidence.
 
On the other hand, if the defendant “has met that burden,
the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a triable issue of one or
more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) The plaintiff may not merely rely on
allegations or denials in its pleadings to show that a triable issue of
material fact exists, but instead “shall set forth the specific facts showing
that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the cause of action.” (Ibid.)
“If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary judgment should be granted.” (Avivi
v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal. App. 4th 463,
467.)     
 
Issue 1: Fourth Cause of Action for Negligence and Issue 2:
Fifth Cause of Action for Premises Liability
 
Casillas argues that the fourth and fifth causes of action
fail because as the landlord, it did not know that tenant and Defendant Romero
was keeping any dangerous or vicious dogs, and there was no joint venture,
partnership, or agency relationship between them. As to whether Casillas had
actual knowledge of the dog’s dangerous and vicious tendencies, the Court finds
that Plaintiff provides sufficient facts to raise a triable issue of fact. They
are as follows:
 
Although Casillas denies seeing or asking
about the breed of the dogs (Exhibit 2: Casillas Depo. pp. 97:5-17), Romero
testifies that Casillas met the dogs on multiple occasions. (Exhibit 3: Romero
Depo. pp. 19:11-24, 22:11-23:23, 117:14-24). Casillas admits seeing the “Beware
of Dog” sign and may have posted it himself. (Exhibit 2: Casillas Depo. pp.
100:9-25, 101:21-102:3.) He acknowledges that a neighbor complained about the
dogs. (Exhibit 2: Casillas Depo. pp. 102:4-104:25.) Additionally, Casillas
heard the dogs bark loudly during rent collection. (Exhibit 2: Casillas Depo.
p. 97:5-17.) 
 
Romero informed Casillas that the dogs
needed to be put away before anyone, including Casillas, entered the premises.
(Exhibit 3: Romero Depo. pp. 70:16-25, 34:23-35:10, 98:6-99:10, 114:13-24.) Romero
also warned anyone entering the property, including maintenance men and
Casillas, to let him know in advance to put the dogs away. (Declaration of
Kimberly Anguiano, ¶ 9.) Romero often boasted about his dog’s viciousness.
(Kimberly Anguiano Decl. ¶ 7.) Plaintiff frequently saw dead animals in the
yard. (Kimberly Anguiano Decl. ¶ 8.)
 
Casillas claims he allowed two dogs on
the premises, one being a service dog for anxiety, which the Lease Agreement
does not mention. (Exhibit 5: Lease Agreement ¶ 15; Exhibit 3: Romero Depo. pp.
42:7-43:24.)
 
These facts and contradictions provide sufficient evidence
to raise a triable issue of material fact regarding Casillas’ knowledge of the
dogs’ dangerous propensities. However, Plaintiff fails to provide any evidence
to raise a triable issue of fact as to the existence of a joint venture between
Castillas and Romero. Plaintiff points to the following:
 
Casillas claims in his declaration and
deposition that he never authorized Romero to sublease the guest house and
never shared profits from the rent. The Lease Agreement allows subleasing for
an additional $200.00. (Exhibit 5: Lease Agreement ¶ 5.) Plaintiff provided
documents showing she paid Romero $200.00 for rent in August 2019. (Exhibit 7:
Rent Payments.) Casillas testified that by the second or third month of the
lease, Romero was unable to afford rent due to late payments and a bounced
check. (Exhibit 2: Casillas Depo. pp. 94:16-95:16.) 
 
Casillas insisted on a $3,000 rent
amount despite Romero’s initial request to pay less and noted that Romero
consistently paid rent late. (Exhibit 2: Casillas Depo. pp. 60:10-61:19.)
Romero testified that he informed Casillas about subleasing the guesthouse to
afford the rent, and Casillas did not object. (Exhibit 3: Romero Depo. pp.
78:7-18.) Additionally, Romero’s co-worker, Allen Mejia, subleased the guest
house with Casillas' permission, paying rent in cash that went to Casillas.
(Exhibit 3: Romero Depo. pp. 28:22-29:12, 30:2-33:21, 36:9-37:17, 50:10-23.)
 
Romero also testified that two
additional people lived in the main house with Casillas’ knowledge and
permission. (Exhibit 3: Romero Depo. pp. 25:15-27:10.) 
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff fails to
demonstrate how this raises a triable issue as to the existence of a joint
venture. As Castillas states in his reply, allowing subleasing to help Romero
pay rent does not create a shared business interest or an agreement to share
profits or losses between Romero and Casillas, so essential elements of
partnership and joint venture are absent. Additionally, there is no evidence
that Casillas authorized Romero to act on his behalf or that Casillas
controlled Romero’s actions. There is also no evidence that Casillas caused the
plaintiff to believe that Romero was acting as Casillas’ agent or that the
plaintiff reasonably relied on such a belief. Consequently, the subletting
arrangement was purely a landlord-tenant relationship. The Court agrees and
finds that the fourth and fifth causes of action fail as a matter of law. 
 
Thus, the Court GRANTS Castillas’ MSA as to Issues 1 and 2. 
 
Issue 3: Sixth Cause of Action for IIED
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff’s claim for IIED also fails.
Here, there is no evidence that Casillas engaged in extreme or outrageous
conduct, nor is there evidence that Casillas intended to cause emotional
distress or acted with reckless disregard. Plaintiff argues that Casillas knew
there were six people living on the premises, both the main house and guest
house were sublet to help Romero pay rent, and the guesthouse was made
habitable for subleasing. Casillas also knew about the dogs roaming freely, saw
or posted the “Beware of Dog” sign, received a neighbor’s complaint about the
dogs, and was informed by Romero that the dogs were not friendly and needed to
be put away when anyone entered the premises. Despite these points, the
evidence does not demonstrate that Casillas’ conduct was so extreme as to
exceed all bounds tolerated in a civilized community. Without such a showing, Plaintiff
cannot establish the first element of IIED. Therefore, there is no triable
issue of fact regarding whether Casillas’ conduct was outrageous, and the sixth
cause of action fails as a matter of law.
 
Thus, the Court GRANTS Castillas’ MSA as to Issue 3.  
 
Therefore, Castillas’ motion for summary judgment is
GRANTED.
