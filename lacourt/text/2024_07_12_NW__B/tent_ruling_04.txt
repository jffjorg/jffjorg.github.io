  vs RUDY ALBERTO RAYO,, et al.




REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT
  AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:
 


(1)  
  Rudy Alberto Rayo;
  and
(2)  
  Lydia Rodriguez



 
 
TENTATIVE
 
Plaintiff Nicholas
Alcantar (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendants Rudy Alberto Rayo
(“Rayo”), Jennifer Saavedra (“Saavedra”), Lydia Rodriguez (“Rodriguez”), and
Does 1 to 100 for damages arising from Plaintiff being punched in the face and
kicked. Plaintiff sets forth three causes of action for assault, battery, and
intentional infliction of emotional distress against Rayo, Saavedra, and
Rodriguez. Plaintiff’s fourth cause of action for negligence against all
defendants. Plaintiff then filed an amendment to complaint naming Down and Out
Bar as Doe 1.
 
On April 23, 2024, the Court denied
the default judgment packet submitted on January 16, 2024 for the following
reasons:
 
First, Plaintiff only filed a
request for court judgment against Rayo and request for court judgment against
Rodriguez on January 1, 2024. No default package (CIV-100, JUD-100, and
declaration) was filed for Saavedra or for Down and
Out Bar (Doe 1). Unless Plaintiff plans on dismissing Saavedra and Down and Out
Bar (Doe 1) from this action, Plaintiff must request court default judgment
against all named defendants simultaneously to avoid double recovery. 
 
Second, Plaintiff has
not dismissed all unnamed Doe defendants (i.e. Does 2 to 100). (CRC
3.1800(a)(7).)
 
Third,
the Court notes that Plaintiff appears to be seeking duplicative damages
against Rayo and Rodriguez. If all the named defendants whom Plaintiff seeks
default judgment against are jointly and severally liable for the same amount,
then Plaintiff must submit one JUD-100 identifying all jointly and severally
liable defendants in Item 5(a). Otherwise, if defendants are not jointly and
severally liable for the same amount, Plaintiff must submit admissible evidence
substantiating the liability and individual damages sought against each
separate defendant.
 
On June 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
new default judgment application. 
 
      First,
per the Court’s April 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed a CIV-100 and 
      
      Second,
Plaintiff filed a dismissal on June 10, 2024, as to Does 2 through 100. 
      
      Third,
However, Plaintiff also filed a
JUD-100 which had the total amount missing in Item 6(a). Nevertheless, Plaintiff
also filed one proposed judgment identifying
all jointly and severally liable defendants and listing the special damages,
general damages, costs, and attorney fees. (Proposed Judgment at p.1.)
 
      Thus, Plaintiff has corrected the
deficiencies noted on April 23, 2024. Accordingly, the Court grants judgment
against Defendant DOWN AND OUT BAR, RUDY ALBERTO RAYO, JENNIFER SAAVEDRA, and
LYDIA RODRIGUEZ in the amount of $1,405,686.14 which consists of $2,662.00 for
special damages, $1,000,000.00 in general damages, plus costs in the amount of
$3,024.14 and attorney fees in the amount of $400,000.00. 
 
      Nevertheless, Plaintiff fails to provide
any declaration regarding the $400,000.00 requested in attorney’s fees.
Additionally, Plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to support the
$1,002,662 in damages. Also, Item 7 in the CIV-100 forms was blank and unsigned
regarding the Memorandum of Costs. Moreover, the Statement of Damages were not
filed on CIV-050. 
 
      Therefore, the Court denies without
prejudice the application for default judgment. Plaintiff is ordered to correct
the deficiencies
