```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's motion for sanctions against the plaintiff is untimely and has been denied. The judge finds that the statutory deadline set forth under Code of Civil Procedure § 2024.020 applies, which requires that any motion concerning discovery be heard on or before the 15th day before the date initially set for trial. The defendant's argument that the motion is not a discovery motion is not persuasive, as the sanctions sought by the defendant are related to discovery abuses. The judge also finds that the defendant could have sought to have the instant hearing advanced or moved pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 2024.050 to have this matter heard, but did not. As a result, the motion for sanctions is denied.
