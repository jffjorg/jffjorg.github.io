ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
            Plaintiff
Juan Ramon Fuentes Hernandez filed the instant lawsuit alleging causes of
action for negligence and negligence per se on August 9, 2019. On October 24,
2019, Defendants filed their Answer.
             On May 23, 2024, Defendants filed their Motion
for Leave to Amend to File First Amended Answer. 
 
            On June 7,
2024, the matter was assigned to Judge Karen Moskowitz in Department B of the
Van Nuys Courthouse East. 
 
II.                
Legal
Standard
 
            “The court may, in furtherance of
justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any
pleading.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473(a)(1).) “Any judge, at any time before or
after commencement of trial, in the furtherance of justice, and upon such terms
as may be proper, may allow the amendment of any pleading or pretrial
conference order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 576.) Specifically, there is a right to
amend “to correct inadvertent misstatements of facts or erroneous allegations
of terms.” (Berman v. Bromberg (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 936, 945.)
 
            “A motion to amend a pleading before
trial must . . . [s]tate what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed
to be deleted, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the
deleted allegations are located; and [s]tate what allegations are proposed to
be added to the previous pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and
line number, the additional allegations are located.”¿ (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1324(a).)¿ The declaration must also specify the amendment’s effect, why
it is necessary and proper, when the facts supporting the amended allegations
were discovered, and why the request was not made earlier.¿ (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324(b).)¿
 
            Discussion
            
            Defendants
seek to amend their Answer to include Proposition 213, Last Clear Chance, and
reasonable and necessary medical expenses affirmative defenses. 
 
            As a
preliminary matter, the Court notes Defendants failed to include the courthouse
address in the Notice of Motion. (Cal. Rul. of Court 3.1110 (b)(1).) Therefore,
Plaintiff was not properly noticed. However, the case was reassigned on June 7,
2024, and notice was sent to Plaintiff on June 7, 2024, and June 18, 2024. As
of July 10, 2024, Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
 
            Here,
Defendants have complied with California Rules of Court Rule 3.1324. (Hughes
Decl. ¶¶ 3-8.) Moreover, Defendants provided a copy of the proposed First
Amended Answer. (Id. at ¶ 14; Ex. 1.) Defendants would be severely and
irreparably harmed if they are not allowed to file their First Amended Answer
to assert primary and meritorious affirmative defenses in this matter. (Id.  at ¶ 13.) Notably, Plaintiff has not filed an
opposition showing that he would be prejudiced by the amendment. Therefore, the
Court grants the motion. 
            
III.             
Conclusion & Order
 
            The Court grants the Motion for Leave to Amend.
Defendants are ordered to file the First Amended Answer within 20 days of this
order.
 
            Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
