And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is issuing a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication brought by Defendant Miguel A. Casillas. The court has reviewed the pleadings, evidence, and arguments presented by both parties.

The court finds that the fourth and fifth causes of action (negligence and premises liability) fail as a matter of law. While there is evidence that Casillas may have had knowledge of the dogs' dangerous propensities, there is no evidence of a joint venture or partnership between Casillas and Romero.

The court also finds that the sixth cause of action (intentional infliction of emotional distress) fails as a matter of law. There is no evidence that Casillas engaged in extreme or outrageous conduct, nor is there evidence that Casillas intended to cause emotional distress or acted with reckless disregard.

As a result, the court grants Casillas' motion for summary judgment.
