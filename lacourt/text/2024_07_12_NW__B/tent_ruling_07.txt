BACKGROUND
            On May 4, 2022, Plaintiff Yvonne
Escobar (“Plaintiff”) filed suit individually and also as an administrator of
the estate of her deceased mother, Josephine Reyes (“Josephine”) against
Defendants County of Los Angeles (“County”); Los Angeles County Department of
Adult Protective Services (“LA CAPS”), Los Angeles County Department of Mental
Health (“LACDMH”), Khahlalah Todd, and Kimberly Moser for the following four
causes of action: (1) wrongful death (CCP § 377.60); (2) survival action; (3)
negligent retention [LA County Adult Protective Services]; and (4) negligent
retention [LA County Department of Mental Health]. 
Plaintiff alleges that her brother,
Alexander Escobar, became increasingly aggressive and violent towards their
mother, Josephine in the five years preceding her murder. Between October 2015
and the date of Josephine Reyes’ murder on May 5, 2020, the Monterey City
Police Department and Adult Protective Services (“APS”) received numerous
reports regarding Alexander Escobar’s violent, physical abuse of his mother
occurring at their residence. Thus, Plaintiff now claims that as a direct and
proximate result of Defendants’ acts and omissions, Alexander Escobar stabbed Josephine
Escobar to death on May 5, 2020, thereby depriving Plaintiff of the life-long
love, companionship, comfort, society, and care of Josephine Reyes. 
On February 12, 2024, Plaintiff subpoenaed
the Monterey Park Police Department (“MPPD”) which is not a party to this action.
MPPD responded to Plaintiff’s Subpoena Duces Tecum on March 4, 2024, through
its legal representative, Assistant City Attorney to the City of Monterey Park,
Timothy Campen (“Campen”), by producing redacted versions of some of the
requested documents. Specifically, MPPD provided redacted police reports, while
also declining to produce others, citing the California Constitution and Welfare
and Institutions Code §§ 4514 and 5328. Campen stated that the redactions were
statutorily commanded to protect the privacy rights of individuals whose
records were being subpoenaed and that reports pertaining to Welfare
Institutions Code (“WIC”) § 5150 were being entirely withheld. Campen also
advised Plaintiff to seek an Order from the Court specifically directing the
City to produce such records and/or unredacted versions of them.
Thus, on May 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant motion, requesting the Court issue an order to release the documents,
along with the Declaration of Richard L. Lara, and a Proposed Order. 
There is no opposition.
 
 
 
 
DISCUSSION
Applicable
Law
            California Welfare &
Institutions Code § 5328
Section 5328 specifically provides for disclosure
of confidential information “‘[t]o the courts, as necessary to the
administration of justice.’” (Sorenson, supra, 219 Cal.App.4th at p.
444, 161 Cal.Rptr.3d 794, quoting § 5328, subd. (f).) So court proceedings
discussing information obtained in the course of treating a patient or resident
are not confidential precisely because section 5328 expressly authorizes release
of such information under the circumstances. Here, by contrast, the Center does
not argue that any enumerated exemption to section 5328 authorizes disclosure
of confidential information obtained in the course of providing services to
mentally ill and developmentally disabled patients and residents. (State
Dep't of Pub. Health v. Superior Ct. 60 Cal. 4th 940, 955, 342 P.3d 1217, 1225 (2015)).

Application
to Facts
            Plaintiff alleges that her late
mother, Josephine Reyes, was a protected adult under the California’s Elder
Abuse statute. (Motion (“Mot.”), pg. 7.) Plaintiff also alleges that her
brother, Alexander Escobar, had a long history of severe mental illness and a
pattern of physically and emotionally abusing his mother, Josephine. (Id.)
 Further, Plaintiff asserts that Los
Angeles County Department of Mental Health (“LACDMH”) and Los Angeles County
Adult Protective Services (“LA CAPS”) were both aware that Josephine was a
protected adult, as well as Alexander Escobar’s history of severe mental
illness and abuse. (Id.) However, despite the fact both LACDMH and LA
CAPS were informed and aware of the circumstances surrounding Josephine’s
vulnerability and Alexander’s escalating abuse of her, neither institution
acted to prevent the abuse from continuing. (Id.)
            Plaintiff contends that Alexander’s
abuse of Josephine may be evidenced in the foregoing MPPD records she seeks.
Moreover, MPDD may be the only source of such records because they would have
records of the prior incidents and calls, as well as the subject incident of
the instant suit. As such, Plaintiff argues the records are relevant pursuant
to California Evidence. Code § 210, as they would have a tendency to prove a
disputed fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action.
Accordingly, the subject documents and information therein would be admissible
pursuant to Evidence Code § 350. The Court agrees the records Plaintiff seeks
are relevant and also that MPPD may be the only source of such records. 
Although Timothy Campen asserted that the
“redactions of the records that have already been provided are statutorily
commanded to protect the privacy rights of individuals whose records are being
subpoenaed,” Plaintiff is correct that the administration of justice serves as
an express exception to the confidentiality protections of § 5328. The
California Supreme Court was clear in State Dep't of Pub. Health,
finding that court proceedings discussing information obtained in the course of
providing mental health services are not confidential in these circumstances
precisely because § 5328 expressly authorizes the release of this information
under these very circumstances.
Thus, the Court grants Plaintiff’s Motion and
orders the records to be released for the express purpose contained herein.
Accordingly, all relevant records sought that fall under the exception of §
5328 shall be made available in unredacted format. 
 
CONCLUSION
            The Motion for Court Order for the
Release of Documents is GRANTED.
            Plaintiff to give notice.
