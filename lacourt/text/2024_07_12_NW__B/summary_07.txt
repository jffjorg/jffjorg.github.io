And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The motion for court order for the release of documents is granted. The plaintiff, Yvonne Escobar, seeks to obtain unredacted records from the Monterey Park Police Department (MPPD) to support her claims. The MPPD produced redacted records, citing statutory commands to protect the privacy rights of individuals whose records are being subpoenaed. However, the court finds that the administration of justice serves as an express exception to the confidentiality protections of California Welfare and Institutions Code § 5328. Therefore, the court orders the release of the records in unredacted format.
