```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion for leave to amend, allowing the defendants to file a first amended answer. The defendants are required to file the amended answer within 20 days of this order. The court notes that the defendants failed to include the courthouse address in the notice of motion, but since the case was reassigned and notice was sent to the plaintiff on multiple occasions, this error is not deemed prejudicial. The court also finds that the defendants have complied with the necessary procedural requirements and that the plaintiff has not shown that he would be prejudiced by the amendment. As a result, the court grants the motion and allows the defendants to file their first amended answer.
