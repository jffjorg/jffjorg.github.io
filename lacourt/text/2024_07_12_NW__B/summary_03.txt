Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the defendant's motions to compel the plaintiff's responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and demand for production of documents. The plaintiff, Calixo Lopez Gaspar, is ordered to submit verified responses, without objections, within 15 days of notice of this order. The Judge also grants the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $624.95 for each discovery motion, for a total of $1874.85, to be paid by the plaintiff and his attorneys of record within 30 days of notice of the Court's order. The Judge notes that the plaintiff's failure to respond to the discovery requests is a misuse of the discovery process and is entitled to sanctions. However, the Judge does not find it appropriate to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice based on the instant motions.
