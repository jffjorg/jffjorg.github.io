And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a dispute between a plaintiff and defendant ITAP regarding the sale of batteries. The plaintiff claims the batteries store surplus energy generated from rooftop solar panels for use during the evening or power outages. The defendant asserts that the plaintiff's representative, Lundgren, is a convicted felon, but provides no evidence to support this claim. The defendant also disputes Lundgren's representation of a WeChat messaging conversation, claiming it was taken out of context. The court cannot verify the accuracy of Lundgren's representation because the language used in the conversation is not English. The defendant's witness, Hu, claims that the photographs and messaging relate to batteries sold to ITAP through a different entity, and provides an invoice to support this claim. The court notes that the invoice does not reflect the LG16S1P batteries depicted in the photographs. The judge is considering the evidence presented and will issue a final ruling at a future court hearing.
