[1] According
to Plaintiff, these batteries “store[] surplus energy generated from rooftop
solar panels during the daytime to be used to power homes during the evening,
or during power outages.” (Memo 2:20-21.)


[2] Defendants
assert without evidence Lundgren is a convicted felon. (Opposition 2:25.)


[3] The
court cannot verify Lundgren’s representation because the language used in the
thread is not English. Defendants do not expressly dispute Lundgren’s summary
of the messaging. They allege Lundgren has taken the statements out of context.
They assert the discussion concerned another entity’s batteries. (Mullaney
Decl. ¶ 4.)


[4] Based
on the invoice attached as Exhibit 1 to Hu’s declaration and paragraph 3, it
appears Hu works for Defendant ITAP.


[5] Hu
contends the photographs and WeChat messaging relates to batteries sold to it an
entity different than Plaintiff. (Hu Decl. ¶ 4.) Hu claims the batteries
reflected in the photograph in Exhibit A to the Lundgren declaration are batteries
sold to Defendant ITAP through the other entity. The invoice provided to
corroborate Hu’s statement (Hu Decl., Exh. A) does not reflect LG16S1P
batteries, as (apparently) depicted in the photographs.
