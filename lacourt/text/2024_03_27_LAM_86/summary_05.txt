And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted LG Energy Solutions, LTD.'s request for a preliminary injunction against IT Asset Partners, Inc. and its affiliates, prohibiting them from modifying, rewrapping, remanufacturing, repurposing, reselling, and/or distributing the energy storage system (ESS) products without the use of United Nations Certified damaged, defective or recalled (DDR) packaging.

The Judge found that LG Energy Solutions, LTD. has shown a likelihood of prevailing on its claims for fraud, breach of contract, intentional interference with contractual relations, and unfair competition. The Judge also found that the defendants have violated the contracts by reselling and rebranding the recalled batteries, and that the sale of these products poses a significant risk of fire and serious safety hazards to consumers.

The Judge ordered that the defendants must not modify, rewrap, remanufacture, repurpose, resell, and/or distribute the ESS products without the use of DDR packaging, and that they must provide a bond in the amount of $10,000. The Judge also ordered that the defendants must not destroy or conceal any evidence related to the modification, rewrapping, remanufacturing, repurposing, resale, and/or distribution of the ESS products.
