And here is the English text to summarize the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has reviewed the petition and proposed order filed on May 3, 2024, and has not seen sufficient progress in correcting the previously identified deficits. The proposed trust instrument and proposed order have not undergone notable changes. As a result, the Court intends to deny the petition and orders the moving party to reserve a new date and file a new petition, with at least 9 court days' notice. The Court also excuses the personal appearance of the Claimant and the guardian ad litem, allowing counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call.
