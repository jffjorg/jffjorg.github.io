* Plaintiff: UNIVERSAL GARMENT WASH & DYE, LLC
* Defendant/Cros-Complainant: Evanston Insurance Company (sued as DOE 1)
* Defendant: Susan Sirkin dba Sirkin Insurance Agency
* DOES 2 to 20: unnamed defendants

**Background**

* Professional malpractice case
* Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint on December 14, 2021
* Alleges causes of action for Professional Malpractice, Breach of Contract, Intentional Misrepresentation, and Negligent Misrepresentation

**Facts**

* In 2017, Plaintiff accepted an order from non-party Five Star for garment treatment and performed the services
* Garments were damaged due to an unexpected equipment malfunction
* Plaintiff was denied coverage by Evanston Insurance Company under Commercial General Liability and Inland Maritime policies
* Plaintiff was forced to settle Five Star's claim without insurance for $330,000.00

**Disputes**

* Defendant Evanston Insurance Company (EIC) moves for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that it had no duty to defend or indemnify Plaintiff as there was no "suit" against Plaintiff and no court-ordered damages

**Legal Analysis**

* The court considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply papers
* The motion is GRANTED
* The court held that EIC did not breach any obligation under the policy as alleged in the second cause of action for breach of contract in the FAC because it had no duty to defend or indemnify Plaintiff absent Five Star filing a lawsuit against Plaintiff for damages caused to the garments and a court ordering Plaintiff to pay Five Star money damages as a result
* The court also held that the third and fourth causes of action for intentional misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation would fail because EIC did not misrepresent to Plaintiff that there is no coverage for Five Star's claim

**Intentions**

* Defendant EIC intends to demonstrate that it had no duty to defend or indemnify Plaintiff

**Acts**

* Plaintiff accepted an order from non-party Five Star for garment treatment and performed the services
