And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The Judge, Mel Red Recana, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further answers at a deposition in a wrongful eviction case. The motion was filed by the Plaintiff, Oriel Poole, against the Defendants, Ievgenii Slynko, Ganna Slynko, Platon Slynko, and Olena Kuhtaryeva. The Plaintiff seeks to compel further answers to questions asked at the deposition of Defendant Ganna Slynko, but the Judge has denied the motion. The Judge found that the questions asked by the Plaintiff were manifestly irrelevant to the case and did not show a direct relevance to the lawsuit or a reasonable likelihood of leading to admissible evidence. The Judge also denied the Plaintiff's request for sanctions, finding that the Plaintiff's conduct in seeking answers to the questions was not justified.
