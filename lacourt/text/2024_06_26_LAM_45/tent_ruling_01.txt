Background
 
Plaintiff Stephen Brown (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on January
19, 2022, against defendants Mercury Insurance, and California Automobile
Insurance, Co., alleging causes of action for (1) Breach of Contract; (2)
Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing.
The Complaint alleges that on June 6, 2020, Plaintiff’s
home suffered a flood, rendering it uninhabitable. Plaintiff
alleges he and his family were forced to move out and into replacement housing
commencing on June 14, 2020, and that Plaintiff notified Defendants that he and
his family had moved because the flood had rendered the home uninhabitable. 
Plaintiff
alleges that Defendants delayed, obstructed, and effectively denied the claim
for repairs to his home through their lack of diligence, and Plaintiff had to conduct
the repairs himself. Plaintiff also alleges Defendants improperly denied
reimbursement for temporary housing.
On December 7, 2023, Defendant California
Automobile Insurance Co. (“Defendant”) filed this motion to compel Plaintiff’s
deposition. On June 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. No reply has been
filed.
Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure, section
2025.450 provides that “[i]f, after service of a deposition notice, a party to
the action . . . without having served a valid objection under Section
2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it . . . the
party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent's
attendance and testimony . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450(a).) “Any party
served with a deposition notice . . . waives any error or irregularity unless
that party promptly serves a written objection specifying that error or
irregularity at least three calendar days prior to the date for which the
deposition is scheduled, on the party seeking to take the deposition and any
other attorney or party on whom the deposition notice was served.” (C.C.P. §
2025.410.) 
CCP section¿2025.450(b)
provides:¿“A motion under subdivision (a)… shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to
attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance.”¿ (Id., § 2025.450(b).)  
If a motion under CCP section¿2025.450(a)
is
granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction in favor of the party who
noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the
deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Id., § 450(g)(1).)
 
Discussion
On March 31, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with a
notice of taking his deposition, which was scheduled for May 16, 2023. (Castronovo
Decl., ¶ 4; Exh. A.) The deposition did not proceed due to the
unavailability of either Plaintiff or his counsel. (Id., ¶ 4.)
On May 12, 2023, Plaintiff served an objection on the grounds that the
deposition was unilaterally noticed. (Id., ¶ 5; Exh.
B.) After numerous meet and confer efforts, Plaintiff’s deposition was set for
August 2, 2023. (Id., ¶¶ 6-9; Exh. E.) On July 17, 2023,
Plaintiff’s deposition was once again continued to August 21, 2023. (Id.,
¶ 10; Exh. F.) On August 17, 2023, defense counsel
agreed to continue Plaintiff’s deposition due to the fact that his counsel was
engaged in trial, and the deposition was continued to November 20, 2023. (Id., ¶
11; Exh. G.) On November 16, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel advised that the
deposition could not proceed as scheduled. (Id., ¶ 12.)
Defense counsel once again asked for deposition dates, but an agreeable date
was not provided. (Id., ¶ 14.)
In opposition,
Plaintiff argues that sanctions should not be imposed because there is
substantial justification for Plaintiff’s deposition not being able to proceed.
Plaintiff’s counsel
states that over the last six months, his calendar
has been impacted by a total of four trials all in cases filed before this
action. As a result, he states it has been impossible to schedule a deposition.
(Murphy Decl., ¶
7.)
As Plaintiff was properly served with multiple
notices of deposition, did not object under Section 2025.410 to the majority of
the notices, and failed to proceed with his deposition, the motion to compel
Plaintiff to appear for deposition is granted.  Plaintiff is ordered to appear for deposition within 20 days of
this order.
            The
court finds that Plaintiff’s counsel provided substantial justification for the
failure to proceed with deposition, but will note that any further delays in
proceeding with the deposition may result in sanctions.
 
            It
is so ordered.
