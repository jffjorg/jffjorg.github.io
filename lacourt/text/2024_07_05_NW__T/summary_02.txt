And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint filed by Reliable Permit Solutions, LLC against Waypoint Permits, LLC, Ben Lopez, and Nancy Lopez. The demurrer sought to dismiss several causes of action, including misappropriation of trade secrets, constructive fraud, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, interference with a contract, and unfair competition.

The judge has sustained the demurrer in part, but overruled it in part. The demurrer was sustained as to the third, fourth, sixth, and seventh causes of action, which alleged misappropriation of trade secrets, constructive fraud, conversion, and interference with a contract, respectively. The judge found that these causes of action are preempted by the California Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA) and the Unfair Competition Law (UCL).

However, the judge overruled the demurrer as to the first, fifth, and eighth causes of action, which alleged misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of fiduciary duty, and unfair competition, respectively. The judge found that these causes of action are not preempted and that the allegations are sufficient to support each element of the claims.

The judge also denied the defendant's request for leave to amend the complaint, finding that the pleading defects identified in the demurrer are not curable and that the opposition failed to present any new facts or arguments to show that the pleading defects can be cured.
