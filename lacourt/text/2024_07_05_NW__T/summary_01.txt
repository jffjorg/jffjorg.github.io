And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has made several tentative rulings in this case. On the motion to set the fee for the deposition of Dr. Mir, the judge denied the motion. The evidence shows that Dr. Mir, a spine surgeon, has charged and been paid $2,250 per hour, which is comparable to the fees of similarly trained physicians in the Southern California area.

On the motion to compel a defense neurology exam, the judge granted the motion. The plaintiff is claiming neurologic injuries and has designated a treating neurologist as a non-retained expert, providing good cause to allow the examination.

On the motion to compel the deposition of Lyft, the judge granted the motion. The plaintiff's notice requested information from Lyft regarding various topics, including the hiring and termination of the defendant. The court granted some of the categories, but denied others as overbroad, vague, or seeking irrelevant information.

Finally, the judge denied the defendant's ex parte application to continue the trial, finding no good cause for the delay. The defendant has failed to explain what discovery has been done and why it was not completed in a timely manner.
