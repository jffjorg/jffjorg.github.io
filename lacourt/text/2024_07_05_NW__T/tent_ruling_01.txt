trial/motion to continue trial: Deny.  No good cause is shown.  Defendant appeared in this case on 5/19/2024,
14 months ago.  Defendant has failed to
explain what discovery has been done, and why anticipated discovery was not
timely done.  The failure to complete
discovery due to own delay is not good cause. 
Was there excusable neglect in the discovery not being timely
completed?  The court set the trial on
one year’s notice.  Again, there is no
explanation why discovery was not timely done. 
At the CMC on 11/15/2023, counsel was advised that the court would not
continue the trial date.  Despite that,
on 3/11/1014, the court continued the trial date for 60 days.
