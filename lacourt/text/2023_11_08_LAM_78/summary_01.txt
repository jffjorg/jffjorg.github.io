Here is a summary of the case in English text:

The case involves a lawsuit brought by Brandon David, who was sexually abused by his father, Doe 5, when he was a minor. Doe 5 was a member of the Fellowship and had a leadership role in the church. The abuse was reported to church leaders, but no action was taken. The lawsuit alleges that the church, Doe 3, was negligent in hiring and retaining employees, failing to provide adequate training and education on sex abuse prevention, and failing to report sexual abuse.

The court has denied the church's motion for summary judgment on the grounds that there are triable issues of material fact regarding the church's duty to protect Brandon David from sexual abuse. The court has also denied the church's motion for summary adjudication on the grounds that there are triable issues of material fact regarding the church's negligence in hiring and retaining employees, failing to provide adequate training and education on sex abuse prevention, and failing to report sexual abuse.

The court has granted the church's motion for summary adjudication on the grounds that there is no evidence that the church had any reason to suspect Doe 5's sexual abuse before his confession. However, the court has denied the church's motion for summary adjudication on the grounds that there are triable issues of material fact regarding the church's duty to warn of sexual abuse and how to handle such situations.

The case is ongoing, and a trial date has not been set.
