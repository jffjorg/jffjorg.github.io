Summary:
The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, awarding them attorney fees and costs in the amount of $63,036.02. The court found that the plaintiffs' counsel's billing was reasonable, except for certain entries, and that the costs incurred by the plaintiffs were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation. The court also denied the defendant's request for a multiplier on the attorney fees, finding that the contingency risk and delay in receiving payment were already accounted for in the substantial hourly rates allowed for by the court.
