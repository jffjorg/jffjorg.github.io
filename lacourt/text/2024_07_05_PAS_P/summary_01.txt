Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled that defendant Randall Ruppart's demurrer to plaintiff's third and fourth causes of action is sustained with leave to amend. The third cause of action alleges that defendant violated Vehicle Code Section 20001(a) by fleeing the scene after striking plaintiff's vehicle from behind. The court finds that the complaint is sufficiently certain to give defendant notice that he fled without complying with the California Vehicle Code. However, the court also finds that the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to show that defendant's conduct caused additional damages beyond the accident itself.

The fourth cause of action alleges intentional infliction of emotional distress. The court finds that the complaint is pled with sufficient certainty, but the court also finds that the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to show that defendant's conduct was extreme and outrageous.

Defendant's motion to strike punitive damages is granted with leave to amend. The court finds that the complaint lacks sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages. The court also finds that the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to show that defendant's conscious disregard for the safety of others caused additional harm.

The court grants plaintiff's 20 days leave to amend and defendant's right to give notice.
