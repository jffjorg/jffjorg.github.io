And here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting Attorney Alexander J. Zeesman's motion to be relieved as attorney of record for Plaintiff Michael Unzicker. The attorney seeks to withdraw due to an irretrievably broken client-attorney relationship. The motion is unopposed, and the court finds that this is not a critical point in the litigation, as the next hearing is a hearing on a Motion for Summary Judgment on September 10, 2024, which was filed on May 1, 2024, giving the client ample time to find new counsel or oppose the motion. The court orders that counsel file proof of service of the order on the plaintiff within 5 days of notice of the ruling, and the attorney will be relieved upon filing of the proof of service.
