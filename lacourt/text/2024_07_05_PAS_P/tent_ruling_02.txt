 Case Number:  23AHCV01919    Hearing Date:   July 5, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING ATTORNEY ALEXANDER
J. ZEESMAN’S MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS ATTORNEY OF RECORD FOR PLAINTIFF MICHAEL
UNZICKER


The Court may issue an
order allowing an attorney to withdraw from representation after notice to the
client. (CCP § 284.) The attorney may
withdraw from representation as
long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice to the client's
interest—i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in the litigation. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; see California Rule of Professional Conduct 3-700.) 
 Attorney Alexander J. Zeesman seeks to be
relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Michael Unzicker. Mr. Zeesman asserts that he
is seeking to withdraw because the attorney-client relationship is
irretrievably broken. Specifically, he declares a “breakdown in client-attorney
relationship”. (MC-052 Item 2.) The motion is unopposed. Mr. Zeesman has
complied with all procedural requirements, including giving notice of this
hearing to his client.
 The next hearing in this case is a hearing on
a Motion for Summary Judgment on 9/10/2024. The motion was filed 5/01/24,
giving Plaintiff Michael Unzicker plenty of time to find new counsel or to
oppose. Therefore, this is not a critical point in the litigation.
 THE MOTION IS GRANTED. COUNSEL IS TO FILE
PROOF OF SERVICE OF ORDER ON PLAINTIFF WITHIN 5 DAYS OF NOTICE OF RULING.
COUNSEL WILL BE RELIEVED UPON FILING OF PROOF OF SERVICE OF ORDER.
