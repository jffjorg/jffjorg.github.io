     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
receiver kevin singer’s motion to
  confirm sale 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On November 30, 2023, Plaintiff U.S.
Bank Trust Company, as trustee for Velocity Commercial Capital Loan Trust
2022-5, filed this action against Defendant Los Angeles Hostel, LLC for (1)
judicial foreclosure, (2) assignment of rents, (3) appointment of receiver, (4)
right to inspect, and (5) injunctive relief. 
            On May 1, 2024, the Court granted
the parties’ stipulation to the appointment of Kevin Singer as receiver of the
subject property and for the imposition of a permanent injunction. 
            On August 21, 2024, the Court
granted Plaintiff’s motion to authorize the sale of receivership property. 
            On December 24, 2024, receiver Kevin
Singer filed the instant motion to confirm the sale. There is no opposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD
“The receiver has, under the control of
the Court, power to bring and defend actions in his own name, as receiver; to
take and keep possession of the property, to receive rents, collect debts, to
compound for and compromise the same, to make transfers, and generally to do
such acts respecting the property as the Court may authorize.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 568.) “A receiver may, pursuant to an order of the court, sell real or
personal property in the receiver’s possession upon the notice and in the
manner prescribed by Article 6 (commencing with Section 701.510) of Chapter 3
of Division 2 of Title 9.” (Id., § 568.5.) 
“[T]he court has full power to order the
receiver to dispose of property in such a manner as the court may deem to be
for the best interest of the parties concerned and the advice of the receiver
and his opinion in regard to the value of the property, the manner, time and
place of its disposition are entitled to great respect and weight.” (People
v. Riverside University (1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 572, 583.) “Generally speaking
if no good reason appears for refusing to confirm a receiver’s sale, such as
chilling of bids or other misconduct or gross inadequacy of price, the sale
should be confirmed.” (Id. at p. 582.) 
“A court of equity has the power to order
the sale of property free and clear of liens and encumbrances.” (City of
Riverside v. Horspool (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 670, 684.) A court may “tailor
the method of sale of receivership property to the circumstances before it,”
which includes “authoriz[ing] the sale of property free and clear of all liens
and encumbrances.” (County of Sonoma v. Quail (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 657,
684, 687.)
DISCUSSION
            The receiver has contracted with a
buyer for $1,325,000. (Singer Decl. ¶ 1.) This was the best and highest price
attainable. (Id., ¶ 5.) The Court will oversee an overbid hearing to
determine the best offer before confirming the sale. (See id., ¶¶ 7-10.)

Because the contract price of $1,325,000
is insufficient to cover the lien amount of $1,687,500, the receiver
additionally requests the Court to strip the lien and confirm the sale free and
clear. (Singer Decl. ¶¶ 3, 11.) The receiver has demonstrated through
uncontradicted evidence that the highest attainable price is $1,325,000.
Because this is insufficient to satisfy the lien in full, stripping the lien is
warranted in this case. (See City of Riverside, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at
p. 684; County of Sonoma, supra, 56 Cal.App.5th at pp. 684, 687.)
CONCLUSION
            Receiver Kevin Singer’s motion is
GRANTED. Overbid hearing is set for January 22, 2025 at 8:30am. The subject
property shall be sold free and clear, with the proceeds (minus relevant fees
and costs) applied to repayment of the loan.
