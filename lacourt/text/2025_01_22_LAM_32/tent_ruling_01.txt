                        Defendant.
  


 
  Case No.:  23STCV08456
  Hearing Date:  January 22, 2025
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to set aside
  dismissal 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On April 17, 2023, Plaintiff Yung
Chung filed this action against Defendant Dave Stringer for breach of contract
and injunctive relief. 
            On December 5, 2024, the Court held
an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal (Settlement), and Plaintiff did not
appear. Accordingly, the Court dismissed the case pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 581(b)(1). 
            On December 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to set aside the dismissal. Defendant filed his opposition
on January 8, 2025. Plaintiff filed his reply on January 15, 2025.
LEGAL STANDARD
            “The court may, upon any terms as
may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473(b).) Because the law favors resolution on the merits,
doubts are resolved in favor of the party requesting relief, and only “slight
evidence” is needed to justify relief. (Caldwell v. Methodist Hospital
(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1521, 1524.) “[C]ourts have often granted relief pursuant
to the discretionary relief provision of section 473 if no prejudice to the
opposing party will ensue.” (Comunidad en Accion v. Los Angeles City Council
(2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1132-33.) 
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff’s counsel did not appear
for the OSC due to a medical issue. (Kalter Decl. ¶ 4.) As a result,
Plaintiff’s counsel was unable to inform the Court that the parties had not
settled and to request a trial. (Ibid.) This constitutes sufficient
cause to set aside the dismissal. (See Caldwell, supra, 24 Cal.App.4th at
p. 1524 [only “slight evidence” required].) Defendant articulates no prejudice
as a result of setting aside the dismissal. (See Communidad en Accion,
supra, 219 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1132-33 [relief ordinarily granted where no
prejudice is shown].) Given the policy in favor of resolution on the merits,
the Court finds that vacating the dismissal is warranted. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to set aside
dismissal is GRANTED. Final Status Conference is set for _______________, 2025.
Trial is set for _______________, 2025.
