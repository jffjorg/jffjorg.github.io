And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting Receiver Kevin Singer's motion to confirm the sale of receivership property. The sale price is $1,325,000, which is the best and highest price attainable. However, this amount is insufficient to cover the lien amount of $1,687,500, so the receiver is requesting that the lien be stripped and the sale confirmed free and clear. The judge agrees that stripping the lien is warranted in this case and will confirm the sale free and clear. An overbid hearing is set for January 22, 2025, to determine the best offer before confirming the sale.
