And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Heritage Auctioneers & Galleries, Inc.'s motion to uphold a confidential designation over exhibits and deposition testimony related to the sale of an original Star Trek starship model. The Court granted the motion, finding that the documents and testimony are confidential settlement communications between Heritage and a third party. The Court's ruling is based on its earlier order granting Heritage's motion to uphold a confidential designation over 10 exhibits produced in discovery. The Plaintiffs, Dustin Riach and Jason Rivas, had filed a complaint against Heritage, alleging breach of duties, negligence, fraud, and deceptive trade practices, but the Court's ruling does not address the merits of the case.
