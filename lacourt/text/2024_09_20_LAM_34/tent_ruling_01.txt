LEGAL STANDARD 
 
“If parties to
pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside of the

presence of the
court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof,
the 
court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by 
the parties, the
court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until 
performance in
full of the terms of the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff moves the court for an order, pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure § 664.6, to enter judgment against Hedley in accordance with the
terms of the parties’ settlement agreement. Plaintiff also seeks 4,187.00 in
attorneys’ fees and costs.
 
On July 9, 2024, Plaintiff and Hedley entered into a Settlement
and General Release Agreement (“Settlement Agreement”) whereby Plaintiff and
Hedley agreed as a matter of compromise and to avoid further expenses and the
uncertainties of litigation to settle, compromise and release any and all
claims between them relating to Hedley’s failure to pay the sums due under April
21, 2021 and September 9, 2021 loans. (Declaration of Jacob Zadeh, ¶ 4.) 
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Hedley
agreed to pay Plaintiff the sum of $194,454.14, which includes the principal
amount due pursuant to the loans, plus prejudgment interest of $20,383.57 and
attorneys’ fees of $24,068.57. (Id., ¶ 5.) The Settlement Agreement also
requires that Hedley was to pay the total amount in installments, with a
minimum payment of $10,000.00 to be made by Hedley to Plaintiff on the 30th day
of each month until the total amount dues is fully paid, however, the first
payment was to be made upon execution of the Settlement Agreement. (Id.)
This first payment was not made (Id., ¶¶ 7-10.) Plaintiff has advised
Hedley he is in breach of the Settlement Agreement. (Id., ¶ 15.).
 
The Settlement Agreement entitles Plaintiff to recover its
actual attorney’s fees and costs incurred in any proceeding to enforce this
Agreement. (Id., Exhibit A [¶ 23].)
 
SANCTIONS
 
Plaintiff seeks sanctions against Hedley in the amount of $4,187.00
[calculated as follows: 10.6 hours attorney time at $395.00/hour]. 
 
Utilizing a Lodestar approach, and in view of the totality
of the circumstances, the court finds that the total and reasonable amount of
attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with
the pending motion is $1,580.00 [i.e., 4 hours at $395.00/hour]. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is unopposed. The court grants Plaintiff’s motion.
