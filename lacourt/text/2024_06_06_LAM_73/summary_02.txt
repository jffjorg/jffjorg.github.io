And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Plaintiff, Wesco Insurance Company, filed a request for default judgment against the Defendant, Jerry Selvin Sanchez, on May 8, 2024. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant failed to pay premiums for insurance coverage provided from 2020 to 2022. The Plaintiff performed an audit on the policies and found that the premium basis estimate provided by the Defendant was inaccurate. The Plaintiff seeks a judgment against the Defendant in the total amount of $59,586.84. However, the Judge denied the Plaintiff's request for default judgment because the Plaintiff failed to correctly fill out the JC Form CIV-100. The Plaintiff checked both boxes instead of identifying whether the action is an obligation for goods, services, loans, or extensions of credit.
