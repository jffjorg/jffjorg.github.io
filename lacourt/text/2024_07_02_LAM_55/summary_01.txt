And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is based on the information presented before the hearing. The case is a legal malpractice lawsuit brought by Rolan Feld against David A. Erikson and Erikson Law Group. The case was stayed until September 5, 2024, after David A. Erikson's death. Counsel for the defendants, Kaufman Dolowich LLP, is seeking to be relieved as attorney of record due to insufficient insurance coverage to pay for the defense of the case through trial.

The Judge is willing to continue the motion to permit counsel to serve the plaintiff with papers and is inclined to grant the motion once the issues regarding S. Ryan Patterson and Erikson Law Group are resolved. However, counsel failed to provide proof of notice to the plaintiff, as required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d). The Judge also wants to confirm if counsel will continue to represent Erikson Law Group, which is also a defendant in the case.
