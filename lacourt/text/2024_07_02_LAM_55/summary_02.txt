And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by Defendant Emiliano Malizia to quash service of the summons and complaint due to lack of personal jurisdiction. The plaintiffs, SOLUTIONS 30 EASTERN EUROPE, S.R.L. et al., seek damages against the defendants for alleged legal malpractice. The judge finds that the plaintiffs failed to serve the summons and complaint in compliance with the requirements for substituted service. The judge also notes that the plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint after the defendant filed the motion to quash service, which renders the motion moot. Therefore, the judge intends to order the motion off calendar.
