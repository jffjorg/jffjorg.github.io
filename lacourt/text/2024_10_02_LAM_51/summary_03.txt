Here is the summary in YAML format:

**Case Information**

* Case Number: 24STCV10778
* Hearing Date: October 2, 2024
* Department: 51
* Judge: Upinder S. Kalra, Department 51

**Parties**

* Plaintiff: Donna DiFronzo
* Defendant: Grant Shenon, APLC

**Facts**

* Donna DiFronzo filed a complaint against Grant Shenon, APLC with seven causes of action on April 30, 2024
* DiFronzo alleged discrimination, harassment, and retaliation by Shenon, APLC
* Shenon, APLC filed a motion to compel arbitration on June 21, 2024
* DiFronzo filed an opposition on September 18, 2024
* Shenon, APLC filed a reply on September 24, 2024

**Legal Standard**

* California law provides that the trial court has authority to compel arbitration under CCP ยง1281.2
* The court must determine whether an agreement to arbitrate exists and whether the agreement covers the dispute
* The party seeking arbitration bears the burden of proving the existence of an arbitration agreement by a preponderance of the evidence

**Arbitration Agreement**

* The October 29, 2021 Arbitration Agreement (Agreement) is at issue
* The Agreement states that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) governs enforcement
* The Agreement was not signed by DiFronzo, but Shenon, APLC attached a copy of the Agreement to the motion
* DiFronzo disputes the existence of the Agreement, arguing that it was superseded or unsigned

**Analysis**

* The court found that Shenon, APLC met its initial burden of proving the existence of the Agreement
* However, the court concluded that the 2023 Handbook, which omitted the Arbitration Agreement, controls and does not have an arbitration agreement
* Therefore, the motion to compel arbitration is DENIED

**Intentions**

* The court's intention is to deny the motion to compel arbitration and allow the dispute to proceed to trial

**Significant Statements**

* "The party seeking arbitration can meet its initial burden by attaching to the petition a copy of the arbitration agreement purporting to bear the respondent's signature." (Bannister v. Marinidence Opco, LLC)
* "If the moving party meets its initial prima facie burden and the opposing party disputes the agreement, then in the second step, the opposing party bears the burden of producing evidence to challenge the authenticity of the agreement." (Gamboa v. Northeast Community Clinic)
* "The court should attempt to give effect to the parties' intentions, in light of the usual and ordinary meaning of the contractual language and the circumstances under which the agreement was made." (Weeks v. Crow)
