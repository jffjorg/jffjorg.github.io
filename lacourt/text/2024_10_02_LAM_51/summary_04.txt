And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the defendant's attempt to enforce the 2003 Mandatory Arbitration Agreement and their analysis of the 2023 Handbook, which includes a superseding clause. The court will limit its discussion to the 2021 and 2023 handbooks for clarity and consistency. The judge finds that the plaintiff's agreement to abide by the 2023 Handbook's policies and procedures during employment is improper, as this contradicts evidence of prior agreements or contemporaneous oral agreements. The judge cites Grey v. American Management Services (2012) in support of this finding.
