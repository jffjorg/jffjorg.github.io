And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc.'s motion to compel plaintiff Anita Gonzales' deposition and vehicle inspection. The plaintiff had objected to the deposition notice, claiming unavailability, but the judge found that the objection was not valid under California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) §2025.410. The judge also found that defendant had provided ample opportunities for plaintiff to offer available dates, but plaintiff failed to do so.

The judge ordered plaintiff to appear for deposition at a mutually agreeable time and place within 20 days and to produce the vehicle for inspection at a mutually agreeable time and place within 45 days. Additionally, the judge ordered plaintiff and her counsel to pay monetary sanctions to defendant in the amount of $750 within 30 days.

The judge also emphasized the importance of counsel complying with deposition notices and managing their professional obligations to ensure that cases are timely prosecuted.
