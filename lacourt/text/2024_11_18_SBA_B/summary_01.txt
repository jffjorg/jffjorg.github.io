And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motions to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Production of Documents, Set One, filed by the plaintiffs. The motions are denied due to procedural defects. The Court finds that the plaintiffs failed to file separate statements, did not seek to engage in an IDC prior to the hearing, and did not identify the specific requests for production that they seek to compel further. The Court also finds that the defendant acted with substantial justification and sanctions are not warranted. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
