 Case Number:  24SMCV02357    Hearing Date:   December 16, 2024    Dept:  I This is a motion to strike the answer.  The motion is MOOT.  The moving papers suggest that Ernest
Financial’s answer be stricken because it is suspended and because Bogner, who
filed the answer, is not licensed to practice law in California.  Normally, those would be compelling
arguments.  But Ernest Financial did not
file an answer, so there is nothing to strike and no one engaged in any
improper conduct.  Bogner filed his own
answer, but he is allowed to do so.  The
court will direct that no default be taken for 30 days against Ernest
Financial.  If, during that time, it
cures the suspension and files an answer (through California counsel), then the
case can move forward.  Otherwise, the
likely result is that it will be defaulted. 
 
The matter is also here on a CMC.  The court will inquire whether it is likely
that Ernest Financial will answer.  After
all, it is possible that there is no intent to answer (and Bogner might well
know one way or the other).  If Ernest
Financial is going by way of default, then it makes sense to hold the CMC and
set appropriate dates.
