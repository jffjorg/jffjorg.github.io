And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 24SMCV03286, stating that the demurrer is overruled. The case involves a plaintiff who allegedly breathed in a toxic gas while walking, but the cause of the release is unknown. The judge is allowing the plaintiff to name all parties who may be responsible, as in the case of Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co., where the court sustained the demurrer. The judge notes that the plaintiff is entitled to do so at the pleading stage, and the discovery process will sort out the responsible party. The defendant, Teichert, has 15 calendar days to answer. The judge will not delay the case management conference, unless a new party is added to the case.
