And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Schrader v. (no defendant specified), pending a final status conference. The court has received no papers from the parties as requested, and Schrader has requested a continuance due to seeking new counsel. The judge has denied the request, finding that good cause has not been shown. The parties have failed to complete discovery, plan for trial, and have not been ready for trial. As a result, the court has vacated the trial date and will schedule a new one in February, giving priority to the court's schedule over the parties'. The court will also hold an OSC re: Sanctions against the parties and plaintiff's counsel for their failure to be ready for trial. Any party who is not a human and does not have a lawyer by the TSC date will have their answer stricken and be placed in default.
