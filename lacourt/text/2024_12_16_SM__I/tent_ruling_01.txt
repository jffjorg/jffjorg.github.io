  Case Number:  21SMCV01921    Hearing Date:   December 16, 2024    Dept:  I This ex parte is really an MIL and will be treated as
such.  The parties ought to agree on
their MIL schedule (making sure that the last brief is filed at least 5 court
days before the FSC) and this will be treated accordingly.  Absent stipulation, MIL’s are due per Code
and Rule—16 court days before the FSC.
 
The court will not rule at this time on the merits.  However, the issue seems to be: (1) whether
the original demand was effective such that the decision not to designate acts
as a bar to calling an expert; and (2) if so, whether there is some
justification for plaintiff’s election not to name an expert such that
plaintiff ought to be relieved of the decision not to designate.  Plaintiff suggests that extending the trial
date—given that the extension also included an extension of discovery cut off
dates—also nullified the expert exchange demand.  The Eisner defendants disagree.  Plaintiff also contends that the fault lies
with the Eisner defendants due to the failure to make Eisner available for
deposition.  The court does not have
enough knowledge to advise on that theory at this time.
 
Therefore, the ex parte application is DENIED WITHOUT
PREJUDICE to an appropriate MIL.
