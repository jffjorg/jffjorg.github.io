And here is a summary of the tentatively ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion to strike the answer filed by Bogner on behalf of Ernest Financial. However, the judge has determined that the motion is moot because Ernest Financial did not file an answer in the first place. The judge has also taken into account that Bogner is not licensed to practice law in California, but this does not affect the outcome because Ernest Financial did not file an answer. The judge has directed that no default be taken against Ernest Financial for 30 days, during which time the company can cure its suspension and file an answer through California counsel. If Ernest Financial files an answer, the case can move forward. If not, the likely result is that it will be defaulted. The judge has also scheduled a case management conference to inquire whether Ernest Financial intends to answer and to set dates accordingly.
