And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the ex parte application without prejudice. The application was essentially a motion in limine (MIL) and the judge is requiring the parties to agree on a schedule for filing their MILs. The judge will not rule on the merits of the case at this time, but is only addressing the issues related to the effectiveness of the original demand and the plaintiff's decision not to name an expert. The judge is also not taking a position on the plaintiff's theory that the fault lies with the defendant for failing to make one of its representatives available for deposition. The judge is allowing the parties to continue with their discovery and will consider the issue further at the Future Settlement Conference.
