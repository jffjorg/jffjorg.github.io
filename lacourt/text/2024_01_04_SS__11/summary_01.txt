Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to quash the subpoena without prejudice until certification is resolved. The defendant, Baker Commodities, Inc., had moved to quash a business-records subpoena served on non-party Tetra Tech, Inc. to obtain the Odor Sampling and Dispersion Study and related documents.

The judge found that the subpoena was premature, as discovery is currently limited to certification discovery, and the study and related documents do not bear on certification. The judge also disagreed with the plaintiffs' argument that the study and related documents are material to certification, finding that the case does not concern the conditions that existed at the time of the study.

The judge declined to reach the issues of attorney-client and work-product privileges, given the preceding analysis. The motion to quash will be granted without prejudice until certification is resolved.
