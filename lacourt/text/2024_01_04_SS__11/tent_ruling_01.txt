TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant’s motion to quash is
granted without prejudice.  The subpoena
is quashed without prejudice until certification is resolved.
 
BACKGROUND
 
“Defendant [allegedly] operates
an industrial animal rendering and grease recycling facility [] that releases
noxious off-site odors, causing material injury” to Plaintiffs’ property and to
the putative class members’ properties “through negligence and nuisance.”  (Complaint, ¶ 2.)
 
Here, Defendant moves to quash
Plaintiffs’ business-records subpoena to nonparty Tetra Tech, Inc. (“Tetra
Tech”).
 
DISCUSSION
 
The study is called the Odor
Sampling and Dispersion Study.  In
response to Plaintiffs’ special interrogatories in this case, “Defendant
identified the study and provided a privilege log to Plaintiffs’ counsel[.]”  (Deignan Decl., ¶ 3.)  In turn, Plaintiffs served a business-records
subpoena on Tetra Tech to obtain the study and related documents.[1]  Then the parties met and conferred multiple
times, but they failed to reach an agreement.[2]
 
The first issue is whether the
motion is timely.  Plaintiffs contend the
answer is no because Defendant filed the motion late under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1985.3(g).  (See
Opposition, pp. 9-10.)  The Court
disagrees.  Section 1985.3(g)’s time
limit is nonjurisdictional.  (See Edmon
& Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civ. Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter
Group June 2023 Update) ¶ 8:602.1.)  A
court is free to “grant a motion to quash served even after the date set
for production.”  (Ibid., emphasis in
original.)  
 
The next issue is whether the
subpoena is premature (this issue is not discussed by the parties in their
briefs; the Court is raising it sua sponte). 
The answer is yes.  Right now,
discovery is limited to certification discovery.  The Court finds that the motion should be
granted, and the subpoena should be quashed, without prejudice until
certification is resolved because the study and related documents – which
pertain to an unrelated pre-litigation matter, namely, Defendant’s decision to
hire Jackson DeMarco and Tetra Tech to help prepare Defendant’s response to
SCAQMD’s Rule 415 proposal – do not bear on certification and either are
irrelevant to the case or constitute merits discovery.
 
Plaintiffs’ argument fails to
change the analysis.  Plaintiffs claim
the study and related documents are material to certification.  They assert that they lack other emissions data
and that, without the study and related documents, they would be unable to
perform atmospheric-dispersion modeling to show a classwide basis for
liability.  (See Opposition, p. 14.)  The Court disagrees.  The following facts suggest that the case
does not concern the conditions that existed at the time of the study:
(1) SCAQMD began formulating Rule 415 in 2014 (see Andreoli Decl., ¶ 3); (2)
Tetra Tech’s study is dated May 2015 (see, e.g., Opposition, p. 5);  (3) Plaintiffs’ alleged class period starts
three years prior to the filing of the complaint (see Complaint, ¶ 39) – i.e.,
November 2019, more than four years after the study; and (4) the subject
odor event allegedly commenced in June 2022 (see id. at ¶ 29), almost seven
years after the study.  Thus, at the
certification stage (at least), the study and related documents appear
immaterial.[3] 
 
The last two issues concern the attorney-client
and work-product privileges.  Given the
preceding analysis, the Court declines to reach these issues.
