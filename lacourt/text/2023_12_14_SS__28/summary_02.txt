And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to substitute Charan Macias, the son of the deceased plaintiff Abraham Macias Garcia, as the new plaintiff in the case. The motion is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 377.11, which allows a successor in interest to continue a pending action after the death of the original plaintiff. The judge finds that Charan Macias's declaration satisfies the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 377.32, which outlines the necessary information to be included in the declaration. The judge grants the motion and allows Charan Macias to take the place of his deceased father as the plaintiff in the case.
