 Case Number:  21STCV21197    Hearing Date:   December 14, 2023    Dept:  28 Having  considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows.  BACKGROUND  On June  8, 2021, Plaintiff Hannah Banks filed this action against Defendants The  Academy of Magical Arts, Inc. (“Academy”), Magic Castle Hotel, LLC (“Hotel”), Magic  Castle Park, LLC (“Park”), and Does 1-20 for negligence/premises liability.  On  January 6, 2023, Academy filed an answer.   On January 9, 2023, Park filed an answer.  On January  12, 2023, Academy and Hotel filed a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants Roes  1-20 for indemnity, contribution, and declaratory relief.  On  March 30, 2023, the Court dismissed Hotel with prejudice at Plaintiff’s  request.  On July 6, 2023, Academy and Park (“Defendants”) filed  a motion to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to form interrogatories, set  one, and for sanctions.  The motion was  set for hearing on September 21, 2023.  Plaintiff did not file an opposition.  On September 21, 2023, because the moving  parties had not scheduled and held an Informal Discovery Conference before the  hearing date, the Court took the matter off calendar.   On  July 7, 2023, Defendants filed a motion to compel Plaintiff’s further responses  to request for production, set one, and for sanctions.  The motion was set for hearing on December  14, 2023. Plaintiff did not file an  opposition.  On  July 10, 2023, Defendants filed a motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses (not  further responses) to special interrogatories, set one, and for sanctions.  The motion was set for hearing on December 14,  2023.  Plaintiff did not file an opposition.  On November  15, 2023, the parties’ counsel and the Court held an informal discovery  conference.  On December 8, 2023, counsel  and the Court held another informal discovery conference.  Trial  is currently scheduled for June 10, 2024.  PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS FOR  MOTIONS TO COMPEL FURTHER DISCOVERY RESPONSES  A.      Informal Discovery Conference  The  Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts  Effective October 10, 2022 (Filed September 20, 2022), ¶ 9E, provides: “PI Hub  Courts will not hear Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses to Discovery  until the parties have engaged in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC).  PI Hub Courts may deny or continue a Motion  to Compel Further Responses to Discovery if parties fail to schedule and  complete an IDC before the scheduled hearing on a Motion to Compel Further Responses  to Discovery.”  The  parties attended informal discovery conferences on November 15, 2023 and December 8, 2023.  B.       Timeliness of motions  A  notice of motion to compel further responses must be given within 45 days of  the service of the responses, or any supplemental responses, or on or before  any specific later date to which the parties have agreed in writing. (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2033.290, subd, (c).) Failure to file a motion within this time period  constitutes a waiver of any right to compel further responses to requests for  admission.  Defendants  filed the motions to compel further responses on July 6, 2023 and July 7, 2023.  Plaintiff does contest the timeliness of the  motions.  C.   Meet and confer  “A  motion to compel must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under  Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040.”   (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (b)(1); 2031.310, subd.  (b)(2).)  “A meet and confer declaration  must state facts showing a reasonable and good-faith attempt at an informal  resolution of each issue presented by the motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)   Plaintiff  does not contest the adequacy of Defendants’ meet and confer efforts.  D.      Separate statement  With  exceptions that do not apply here, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345,  requires that any motion involving the content of discovery contain a separate  statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of  factual and legal reasons for why an order compelling further responses is  warranted.   Defendants  filed separate statements for the motions to compel further responses to  discovery.  I.                Motions to  compel further discovery responses  A.              Applicable  law  1.    Inspection demand  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2031.310 provides in part:  “(a) On receipt of a response to a demand for  inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an  order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems  that any of the following apply:          “(1) A statement of compliance with the demand is  incomplete.  “(2) A representation of inability to comply is  inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.  “(3) An objection in the response is without merit or  too general.  “(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with  each of the following:  “(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing  good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.  “(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and  confer declaration under Section 2016.040.  “(3) In lieu of a separate statement required under  the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a  concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.  “(c) Unless notice of this motion is given within 45  days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified  response, or on or before any specific later date to which the demanding party  and the responding party have agreed in writing, the demanding party waives any  right to compel a further response to the demand.  * * *  “(h) Except as provided in subdivision (j), the court  shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that  the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that  other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,  subds. (a), (b), (c), (h).)  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2031.230 provides:  “A representation of inability to comply with the  particular demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling shall affirm  that a diligent search and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to  comply with that demand. This statement shall also specify whether the  inability to comply is because the particular item or category has never  existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never  been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding  party. The statement shall set forth the name and address of any natural person  or organization known or believed by that party to have possession, custody, or  control of that item or category of item.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §  2031.230.)  2.      Interrogatories           Code  of Civil Procedure section 2030.300 provides in part:  “(a) On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the  propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the  propounding party deems that any of the following apply:  “(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is  evasive or incomplete.  “(2) An exercise of the option to produce documents  under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those  documents is inadequate.  “(3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit  or too general.  “(b) (1) A motion under subdivision (a) shall be  accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.  “(2) In lieu of a separate statement required under  the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a  concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.  “(c) Unless notice of this motion is given within 45  days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified  response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding party  and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party waives  any right to compel a further response to the interrogatories.  “(d) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or  attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further  response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the  sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make  the imposition of the sanction unjust. . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,  subds. (a), (b), (c), (d).)  3.    Discovery  sanctions  “The  court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse  of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay  the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a  result of that conduct. The court may also impose this sanction on one  unsuccessfully asserting that another has engaged in the misuse of the discovery  process, or on any attorney who advised that assertion, or on both. If a  monetary sanction is authorized by any provision of this title, the court shall  impose that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted  with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition  of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)  “Misuses  of the discovery process include . . .                                                    *  * *  “(d)  Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §  2023.010.)  B.              Discussion  1.    Defendants' motion to  compel Plaintiff’s further responses to request for production  Propounded:  January 25, 2023 Responses:   May 22,  2023 Motion  filed: July 7, 2023  Granted:   5, 6, 7  Defendants argue that Plaintiff waived any objections  to the requests for production by serving responses after the deadline.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300 subd. (a).)  The Court orders Plaintiff to provide further  verified, code-compliant responses to request for production numbers 5, 6 and 7  and produce the documents, electronically stored information, and/or other  things requested without objections by January 16, 2024.  Defendants ask the Court to grant $780 in sanctions based on four  hours of attorney time to research and prepare the motion at a rate of $195 per  hour.  The Court grants sanctions of $390  based on two hours of attorney time.  The  Court orders Plaintiff and her counsel to pay Defendants $390 in sanctions by  January 16, 2024.  2.    Defendants’ motion to compel Plaintiff's further responses to form  interrogatories  Propounded:  January 25, 2023Responses:  May 22, 2023Motion  filed: July 6, 2023 This  motion was set for hearing on September 21, 2023.  On September 21, 2023, because Defendants had  not scheduled and held an Informal Discovery Conference before the hearing  date, the Court took the matter off calendar.   Defendants  have not re-calendared this motion.  Not  realizing the motion had not been placed back on calendar, the Court told the  parties, at the informal discovery conference, that if the parties did not  informally resolve these discovery disputes the Court would rule on the  motions.  However, the Court cannot rule  on a motion that has not been placed on calendar because Plaintiff is entitled  to receive notice of the hearing.   Defendants may place the motion back on calendar for a future hearing.  II.            Defendants' motion to  compel Plaintiff’s responses to special interrogatories  A.   Applicable law  Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides:  “If a party  to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the  following rules apply:  “(a) The  party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise the  option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to  the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection for  work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on  motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both  of the following conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The  party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with  Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240.  “(2) The  party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,  inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The  party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling response  to the interrogatories.  “(c) The  court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that  the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that  other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then  fails to obey an order compelling answers, the court may make those orders that  are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction,  or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).  In lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.)   B.      Discussion  Propounded:  January  25, 2023 Responses:  Unknown Motion filed: July 10, 2023  At the initial informal discovery conference on  November 15, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel conceded that Plaintiff had not yet  served responses to Defendants’ special interrogatories.  At the next informal discovery conference, on  December 8, 2023, counsel agreed that Plaintiff had served the responses.  However, Defendants’ counsel said the responses  to the special interrogatories were deficient and Defendants wished to keep the  motion to compel on calendar to pursue sanctions.  Defendants ask the Court to grant $585 in sanctions based on four  hours of attorney time to research and prepare the motion at a rate of $195 per  hour.  The Court grants sanctions of $390  based on two hours of attorney time.  The  Court orders Plaintiff and her counsel to pay Defendants $390 in sanctions by  January 16, 2024.  CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS the motion of Defendants The Academy  of Magical Arts, Inc. and Magic Castle Park, LLC to compel further responses to  requests for production, set one, and orders Plaintiff Hannah Banks to provide  further verified, code-compliant responses to request for production numbers 5,  6 and 7 and produce the documents, electronically stored information, and/or  other things requested without objections by January 16, 2024.  The motion of Defendants The Academy of Magical Arts, Inc. and  Magic Castle Park, LLC to compel further responses to form interrogatories, set  one, was taken off calendar and is not before the Court.  Defendants may re-calendar the hearing. The motion of Defendants The Academy of Magical Arts, Inc. and Magic Castle Park, LLC to compel Plaintiff's responses to special interrogatories, set one, is moot except for the motion's request for sanctions. The  Court GRANTS the request of Defendants The Academy of Magical Arts, Inc. and  Magic Castle Park, LLC for sanctions and orders Plaintiff Hannah Banks and her  counsel pay Defendants $780 ($390 plus $390) by January 16, 2024.  Moving  parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  parties are ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
