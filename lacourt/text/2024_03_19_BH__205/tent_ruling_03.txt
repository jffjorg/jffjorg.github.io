 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT 



 
Background
 
            This case
arises from a breach of contract claim. Plaintiff Pierre Caland alleges that
Defendant Alexander Davis asked Plaintiff to give him $1 million so that
Defendant could buy out his business partner and become the sole owner of a
business entity, DTA II. FAC ¶ 7. Defendant promised that he would return the
$1 million if the investment was successful and generated sufficient carried
interest. FAC ¶ 9. In addition, Defendant promised that he would pay Plaintiff
the net proceeds from 10% of all carried interest payments that Defendant
receives from DTA II. FAC ¶ 9. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant has not made
the repayment to Plaintiff, even though the public sale of stock and the
resulting generation of carried interest for Defendant triggered the repayment
obligation. FAC ¶ 13. The FAC further alleges that Defendant began to concoct a
false story for his refusal to pay Plaintiff, telling Plaintiff that he did not
owe Plaintiff money because he inadvertently overpaid him. FAC ¶ 17. 
 
            The FAC
alleges the following causes of action: (1) breach of oral agreement, (2)
promissory estoppel, (3) accounting, (4) conversion, (5) equitable lien, and
(6) constructive trust. 
 
            On December
28, 2023, Defendant filed the instant motion for summary judgment. On February
27, 2024, The hearing for the motion scheduled for March 14, 2024 was continued
to March 19, 2024. 
 
            On February
29, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On March 8, 2024, Defendant filed a
reply.
 
Summary Judgment Standard
 
            The function of a
motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to
whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or
claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. Aguilar
v. Atlantic Ritchfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843. Code Civil of Procedure
section 437c(c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.” Adler v. Minor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119. “The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary
judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits
or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact
within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993)
12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67.
 
            As to each claim
as framed by the complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential
element or to establish a defense. Code Civ. Proc. §437c(p)(2); Scalf v.
D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520. Courts “liberally
construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and
resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” Dore v.
Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389. 
 
            Once the
defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that
a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action
or a defense thereto. To establish a triable issue of material fact, the party
opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive evidence. Sangster
v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.
 
Analysis
 
            Defendant
Alexander J. Davis argues for summary judgment, or in the alternative summary
adjudication on all causes of action on the grounds that they fail as a matter
of law. Defendant asserts that the undisputed facts demonstrate that: (1) the
“agreement” was never formed; (2) Plaintiff himself failed to abide by its
terms; and (3) the parties reached a different agreement a few years later. Defendant
argues that there was no formation of an enforceable agreement with Plaintiff. Defendant
contends that the lack of mutual consent to definitive terms and Plaintiff’s failure
to fulfill the alleged agreement’s conditions, notably the additional $700,000
loan, indicate no binding contract was established. Furthermore, Defendant
asserts that any obligations under the purported agreement were extinguished by
a novation, specifically referencing a subsequent arrangement related to an
investment in Flexport Inc., which replaced the original terms. Defendant also
invokes the statute of frauds, arguing that the oral agreement, purportedly
allowing for indefinite future payments, cannot be enforced as its performance
was not possible within one year. Additionally, Defendant challenges Plaintiff’s
claims for an equitable lien and conversion, arguing that without an
enforceable agreement granting Plaintiff rights to specific funds or assets,
these claims are unfounded. Defendant maintains that the evidence and legal
standards support granting summary judgment in his favor, thereby dismissing
all of Plaintiff’s claims. The evidence in support of Defendant’s arguments is
set forth in a separate statement identifying nine issues.
 
            In opposition, Plaintiff
asserts that triable issues of material fact exist for every claim against Defendant.
Plaintiff’s opposition delineates disputes regarding the 2016 agreement’s
formation, performance, and modification, underlining the presence of
substantial evidence that contests Defendant’s arguments for summary judgment. Plaintiff
emphasizes that the Flexport deal did not supplant the original agreement and
challenges the assertion that the 2016 deal violates the statute of frauds,
arguing it was indeed possible to perform within a year. He further argues
against Defendant’s promissory estoppel, equitable lien, and conversion claim
defenses, presenting evidence of Defendant’s promises and Plaintiff’s
detrimental reliance thereon. Additionally, Plaintiff disputes Defendant’s
claim that there is no basis for punitive damages, offering evidence of Defendant’s
malicious or fraudulent actions. Plaintiff’s opposition is rooted in the
assertion that the extensive factual disputes necessitate jury deliberation,
rendering summary judgment inappropriate.
 
            Defendant largely
repeats his arguments in reply.
 
            Upon review, the
Court finds that there are triable issues of material fact as to Plaintiff’s
claims. The evidence cited by Plaintiff, including documented communications
and actions by Defendant following their agreement, suggests a mutual
understanding and assent to the terms discussed, thereby forming a binding
agreement. The parties do not dispute that they discussed a 2016 Proposal,
wherein Defendant would pay Plaintiff 10% of the net carried interest from
DTAII, Defendant would pay back the $1 million lent from Plaintiff, and
Defendant would repay the $700,000 loan in 90 days. See Plaintiff’s
Undisputed Material Facts “PUMF” no 3. Plaintiff provides that he wired $1
million to Defendant and made the $700,000 available as a loan to be drawn upon
as needed, but Defendant never drew on that loan. Id. no. 4. Plaintiff
also provides deposition testimony where it appears that the parties did reach
a deal on the material terms of the 2016 proposal. See id. no. 6-8. Plaintiff
also provides evidence that he accepted the 2016 deal, which was then
memorialized in a text message. Id. no. 13. This disagreement on whether
a contract was formed, and if so, what its terms were is supported by evidence
such that there is a central triable issue of material fact. Also, Plaintiff
provides evidence that Plaintiff did not fail to perform his obligations in the
contract, particularly the payment of the $700,000 because Plaintiff states
that he made it available to Defendant but he never drew on that loan. PUMF no.
33. Plaintiff also provides evidence to dispute that the Flexport investment
was intended to replace or did replace the 2016 Deal, and that his contribution
to Flexport could not have replaced the 2016 Deal because it was never fully
consummated. Id. no. 41. These elements are critical in considering the
enforceability of the oral contract and weigh against the motion for summary
judgment on the basis of contract formation and enforcement. Thus, the Court
denies Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication as to issue nos. 1-5. 
 
            Regarding the
statute of frauds, the Court is persuaded by the argument that the oral
agreement between Plaintiff and Defendant, as described, does not definitively
require performance beyond one year and thus may not fall squarely within the
prohibitions of the statute. See PUMF no. 46. Also, Plaintiff provides
evidence that the material terms of the 2016 Deal were memorialized in text
message sent to Plaintiff by Defendant. Id. no. 45. Thus, the Court
denies Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication as to issue no. 6.
 
            On the equitable
claims issue, the Court finds merit in Plaintiff’s arguments that his reliance
on Defendant’s promises, supported by documented evidence, could indeed
establish grounds for promissory estoppel, an equitable lien, and potentially
conversion, contingent upon further examination at trial. Plaintiff’s reliance
on Defendant’s promises and the extent to which Defendant acknowledged or acted
upon these agreements represent material facts in dispute. See PUMF no.
53. Plaintiff identifies a quantifiable sum of money (10% interest) that
Defendant owes Plaintiff. Id. no. 54. Whether Defendant’s actions—or
lack thereof—constitute conversion of the assets in question, or if Plaintiff
has a basis to claim an equitable lien, are matters that require a detailed
examination of the facts. See id. no. 55. Thus, the Court denies
Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication as to issue nos. 7-8.
 
            However, the
Court finds that Plaintiff fails to point to specific evidence showing that
Defendant acted with malice, oppression, or fraud to support his claim for
punitive damages. Thus, the Court grants Defendant’s motion for summary
adjudication as to issue no. 9.
 
            Therefore, given
the disputed issues of material fact and the plausible legal theories supported
by Plaintiff’s arguments, the Court denies Defendant’s motion for summary
judgment. The disputes presented by the parties, particularly those concerning
the terms and enforceability of the alleged agreement, promissory estoppel,
equitable lien, and conversion, are better resolved through a full trial where
all evidence can be thoroughly examined and weighed. 
 
Conclusion
            Defendant’s motion for summary judgment/summary
adjudication is DENIED in PART. The motion for summary adjudication as to issue
no. 9, punitive damages, is GRANTED.
