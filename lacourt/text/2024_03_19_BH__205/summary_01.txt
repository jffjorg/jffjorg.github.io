And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the Judge's thinking about a future Court Hearing. The Judge is considering a motion filed by the Defendants, Sunny Acre LLC, to dismiss the case. The Judge is also considering a motion filed by the Plaintiff, Edgar Meinhardt, to join Corp. Realty USA, LLC (CRU) as a necessary party.

The case involves a dispute over the terms of a home loan and the wrongful foreclosure of a property located in Malibu, California. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants misrepresented the terms of the home loan and then wrongfully foreclosed on his home.

The Judge is considering the Plaintiff's allegations and the Defendants' defenses. The Judge is also considering the requirement that the Plaintiff must join CRU as a necessary party, as CRU is the sole managing member of the property and has a direct interest in the outcome of the case.

The Judge has concluded that the Plaintiff has standing to assert his fraud claim and that CRU is a necessary party to the action. The Judge has therefore denied the Defendants' motion to dismiss the case and granted the Plaintiff's motion to join CRU as a necessary party.

The Judge has also ordered that the case proceed to trial, as the issues in the case are complex and cannot be resolved through summary judgment. The Judge has given the parties 30 days to file their final briefs and has scheduled a trial date of [insert date].
