And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that there are triable issues of material fact regarding the plaintiff's claims. The defendant had argued that the plaintiff failed to establish a binding agreement and that the plaintiff's claims were unfounded. However, the judge found that the evidence presented by the plaintiff suggests that a mutual understanding and assent were reached between the parties, forming a binding agreement. The judge also found that the plaintiff's reliance on the defendant's promises, supported by documented evidence, could establish grounds for promissory estoppel, an equitable lien, and potentially conversion. The judge denied the defendant's motion for summary adjudication on the issues of contract formation, enforcement, and the statute of frauds, and instead ordered a trial to resolve the disputed issues.
