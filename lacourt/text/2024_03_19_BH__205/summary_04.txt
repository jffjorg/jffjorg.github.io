And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant to produce further responses to the requests for production of documents (set two). The plaintiff, Christina Hwa, is seeking documents related to the defendant's policies and procedures for serving hot beverages, as well as documents regarding similar incidents of burns caused by hot liquids. The defendant, McDonald's Restaurant of California, Inc., has objected to the requests, claiming that they are vague, ambiguous, overbroad, burdensome and oppressive.

The judge agrees that the requests are relevant and seeks to compel the defendant to produce the documents in an unredacted form. The judge also agrees that the requests are overly broad and seeks to limit the scope of the discovery requests to the past five years.

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion in part and denies it in part. The defendant is directed to produce documents responsive to RFPD No. 1 in an unredacted form, and documents responsive to RFPD Nos. 11-13, limited to the past five years.

The judge's ruling is based on the following grounds: (1) the requests are relevant and material to the plaintiff's claim; (2) the defendant has a stipulated protective order; (3) the defendant's objections are unfounded; and (4) the plaintiff is entitled to review and reflect on relevant documents at his own pace and with no time limits.
