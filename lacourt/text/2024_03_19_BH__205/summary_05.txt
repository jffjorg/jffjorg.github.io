And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's applications for writ of attachment against the defendants, Alan Gomperts and Daniel Halevy. The plaintiff seeks to attach the defendants' property to secure the recovery on claims for breach of guaranty. The defendants defaulted on a promissory note and failed to make payments on their guaranty. The plaintiff has established the probable validity of its claims and has shown that the attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim. The court declines to consider the defendants' opposition, which was filed late, and also declines to rule on their evidentiary objections to the declarations of Bobby Khorshidi and Vivian Prieto. The amount to be secured by the attachment is greater than zero, and the attachment is not a consumer transaction. The plaintiff is required to file an undertaking of $10,000.
