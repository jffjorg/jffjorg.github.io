TENTATIVE RULING
            Defendants BMW of North America, LLC and Sterling BMW’s
Petition To Confirm Partial Final Arbitration Award is GRANTED.
ANALYSIS
Petition To Confirm Arbitration Award
Discussion
            Defendants BMW of North America, LLC
and Sterling BMW move for an order confirming the arbitration award.
The petition to confirm must be
served and filed no later than four years after the date of service of a signed
copy of the award on the petitioner (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288) but may not be
served and filed until at least 10 days after service of the signed copy of the
award upon the petitioner. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288.4.)
            Although a petition to confirm arbitration award may be filed after 10
days of the service of the award (Civ. Proc. Code, § 1288.4), the hearing must
be at least 100 days after the service of the award (Civ. Proc. Code, §
1288.2), which is the period of time in which the respondent may either file a
file a petition to vacate the award, even if that time is beyond the 10 days in
which the respondent may file a response to the petition. (Civ. Proc. Code, §§
1285.2, 1290.6.) As articulated by the California Supreme Court, it
appears that a response to a petition to confirm an arbitration award, which
response seeks to vacate or reduce the award, may be served within 100 days
of the service of the award.(Law Fin.
Grp., LLC v. Key (2023)
14 Cal.5th 932, 946-47 [bold emphasis and underlining added].)
            Here, the award is dated January 9,
2024, and thus cannot have been served any earlier than that date.
As articulated by the California
Supreme Court, it appears that a response to a petition to confirm an
arbitration award, which response seeks to vacate or reduce the award,
may be served within 100 days of the service of the award. 
The Act also sets out a more specific set of procedures
governing postarbitration proceedings, including deadlines by which parties
seeking to confirm or vacate an arbitral award must file those requests with
the court. (See Code Civ. Proc., pt. 3, tit. 9, ch. 4 [“Enforcement
of the Award”].) A party seeking to confirm the arbitral award may file a
petition within four [*946]  years of the service of the final
award. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288.) A party seeking to vacate the arbitral
award, however, has much less time. A request to vacate may be made either
in a petition to vacate (id., § 1285) or in a
response to the petition to confirm (id., § 1285.2). Regardless of the method, the Act
imposes the same deadline: “A petition to vacate an award … shall be served
and filed not later than 100 days after the date of the service of a signed
copy of the award on the petitioner” (id., § 1288), and
identically, “[a] response requesting that an award be vacated … shall
be served and filed not later than 100 days after the date of service of a
signed copy of the award” on the respondent (id., § 1288.2).
 
. . .
 
Under the plain terms of sections
1288 and 1288.2, Key had 100 days from the service of the final
award to request that the arbitration award be vacated—whether she chose to do
so via a standalone petition to vacate or via a response to Lender's petition
to confirm the award. Key's argument that her 139-day filing was nonetheless timely
depends on the proposition that section 1290.6—a general statutory
provision permitting parties to extend the default 10-day period for any
responsive filing in an arbitration matter—supersedes the specific 100-day
deadline for requesting that an arbitration award be vacated, at least when a
petition to confirm has been filed within 100 days of the award's
service. But under the governing statutes, neither deadline supersedes the
other. On the contrary, when a filing both (1) responds to a
petition to confirm, and (2) requests that the arbitration award be vacated,
both deadlines apply: (1) Absent a written agreement or
court [*947]  order, the response must be filed within 10 days
after service of the petition to confirm and (2) in any event, no later than
100 days after service of the award. This rule respects the plain
language of both provisions without reading an unnecessary conflict into the
statutory scheme.  (Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment & Housing Com. (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1387 [241 Cal. Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d
1323] [“[S]tatutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must
be harmonized, both internally and with each other, to the extent possible.”].)
 
(Law Fin. Grp., LLC v. Key (2023) 14 Cal.5th 932, 946-47 [bold
emphasis and underlining added].)
 
            The 100-day period following the
issuance (and presumably service) of the award is April 18, 2024. As such, the
Court continued the hearing on the Petition To Confirm Partial Final
Arbitration Award was CONTINUED to this date. 
 
Any party to an arbitration award
may petition the court to confirm, correct, or vacate the award. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1285.) “If a petition or response under this chapter is duly served
and filed, the court shall confirm
the award as made, whether rendered in this state or another state, unless in
accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and confirms it as
corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1286 [bold emphasis added].) A petition to confirm a binding arbitration shall
name as respondents all parties to the arbitration and may name any other
parties to be bound by the award. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.) The petition shall
(1) set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement to
arbitrate unless petitioner denies the existence of such an agreement; (2) set
forth the name(s) of the arbitrator(s); and (3) set forth or have attached a
copy of the award and written opinion of the arbitrator. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1285.4(a)-(c).) 
Cal. Civ. Proc, § 1290.4 governs
the method of service of the petition to confirm arbitration as follows: 
(a) A copy of the petition and a
written notice of the time and place of the hearing thereof and any other
papers upon which the petition is based shall be served in the manner provided
in the arbitration agreement for the service of such petition and notice.
 
(b) If the arbitration agreement
does not provide the manner in which such service shall be made and the person
upon whom service is to be made has not previously appeared in the proceeding
and has not previously been served in accordance with this subdivision:
 
(1) Service within this State shall
be made in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in an action.
 
. . .
 
(c) If the arbitration agreement
does not provide the manner in which such service shall be made and the person
on whom service is to be made has previously appeared in the proceeding or has
previously been served in accordance with subdivision (b) of this section,
service shall be made in the manner provided in Chapter 5 (commencing
with Section 1010) of Title 14 of Part 2 of this code.

     (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1290.4 [bold emphasis added].) 
Here,
the petition was served by e-mail only on January 26, 2024. A copy of the
arbitration agreement was not attached to the Petition, so it is unclear
whether the arbitration agreement permitted service by e-mail. However, as this
matter was originally filed as a Lemon Law action by Plainitiff/Respondent
herein, electronic service of the petition appears to be appropriate. 

All parties to the arbitration were
named as Respondents in the Petition. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.) The name of
the arbitrator, Hon. Randa Trapp (Ret.), is set forth at ¶ 6 of the Petition.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4(b).) A copy of the award and written opinion is
attached to the Petition. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4(c).) The terms of the
Award are set forth at Page 18 therein. The Arbitrator found against
Plaintiff/Claimant on all claims and denied any relief. (Id.) 
All the requirements for
confirmation of the arbitration award have been satisfied.
Plaintiff/Respondent did not file
any opposition.
          Accordingly,
the petition to confirm arbitration award is GRANTED.  Defendants shall serve notice of this ruling, and are ordered to file a proposed judgment within 10 days.
