Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. The Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged fraud, aiding and abetting fraud, and civil conspiracy against the Defendant. The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant and Jialei made misrepresentations and concealed information, and transferred funds for their personal use. The Defendant argued that the Plaintiff failed to plead specific facts about the Defendant's own fraudulent conduct, but the Judge found that the Plaintiff's allegations were sufficient. The Judge also found that the Plaintiff's claims were not barred by the statue of limitations, as the Plaintiff had delayed discovery of the Defendant's conduct. The case will proceed to the next stage.
