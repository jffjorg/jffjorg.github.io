And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling of Judge Maurice Leiter sets forth the court's findings and orders regarding the demurrers and motions filed in the case. The court has ruled that:

* Defendant Pearl 33's demurrer to the First Amended Complaint is overruled.
* The motion to strike certain allegations as improper is denied.
* The anti-SLAPP motion filed by Defendants Phillip McFillin and Kevin Ferguson is granted.
* The demurrers to the first, second, fourth, and ninth causes of action are sustained with leave to amend.
* The demurrers to the seventh cause of action are overruled.
* The demurrers to the tenth and eleventh causes of action are sustained.
* The court has also granted the defendants' request for judicial notice.

The court has found that the plaintiffs have failed to establish a probability of success on the merits of their claims, and that the defendants' communications relating to the Pennsylvania lawsuit are protected by the litigation privilege. The court has also held that abuse of process is not exempt from the litigation privilege.

The parties are ordered to file and serve a second amended complaint and responses thereto within 30 days of the ruling.
