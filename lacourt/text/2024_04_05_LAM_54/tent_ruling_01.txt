BACKGROUND
 
On July 5, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the
operative first amended complaint against Defendants, asserting causes of
action for intentional and negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary
duty, breach of contract, conspiracy, malicious prosecution, and abuse of
process. Plaintiffs were minority shareholders of Cloud B. Plaintiffs allege
the Defendant majority shareholders conspired with the takeover Defendants to
sell Cloud B and loot Cloud B’s assets, making Plaintiffs’ shares worthless. 
 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer to a complaint may be taken to the whole complaint or to any
of the causes of action in it.  (CCP §
430.50(a).)  A demurrer challenges only
the legal sufficiency of the complaint, not the truth of its factual
allegations or the plaintiff's ability to prove those allegations.  (Picton v. Anderson Union High Sch. Dist. (1996)
50 Cal. App. 4th 726, 732.)  The court
must treat as true the complaint's material factual allegations, but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.  (Id. at 732-33.)  The complaint is to be construed liberally to
determine whether a cause of action has been stated.  (Id. at 733.)
 
A. Derivative
v. Direct Claims
 
Defendant Pearl 33 demurs to the first, second, fourth, and ninth causes
of action for intentional and negligent misrepresentation, civil conspiracy,
and abuse of process on the ground that they are improperly pleaded derivative
claims on behalf of Cloud B.
 
Defendant asserts the causes of action should have been derivative
claims because the alleged harm was to Cloud B, not to Plaintiffs as individual
shareholders. Defendant also argues the claims are barred because Cloud B
released all derivative claims in its bankruptcy action. 
 
Plaintiffs allege that Defendants as majority shareholders and officers
conspired to make Plaintiffs’ minority shares worthless. This is a recognized
exception to mandatory derivative actions. (See Jones v. H.F. Ahmanson (1969)
1 Cal.3d 93, 106.) The demurrer cannot be sustained on this basis.
 
B. Statute of
Limitations
 
Defendant contends the first, second, fourth, sixth, and ninth causes of
action are barred by the statute of limitations and do not relate back to the
original complaint, filed on October 27, 2020, because the claims have been
changed from derivative claims in the original complaint to direct claims in the
FAC. Defendant does not cite authority stating this specific amendment
prohibits application of the relation back doctrine. 
 
C. Fourth Cause
of Action for Civil Conspiracy
 
“The elements of a civil conspiracy are the formation and operation of
the conspiracy and damage resulting to plaintiff from an act done in furtherance
of the common design.” (Stueve Bros. Farms, LLC v. Berger Kahn (2013)
222 Cal.App.4th 303, 323.) Plaintiffs allege that Defendants engaged in a
conspiracy by, among other things, engaging in covert negotiations to take over
Cloud B and divulging Cloud B’s proprietary and confidential information to the
takeover Defendants. This is sufficient to allege a civil conspiracy.
 
Defendant Pearl 33’s demurrer is OVERRULED.
 
D. Motion to
Strike
 
“Any party, within the time allowed to response to a pleading, may serve
and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part" of that
pleading. (CCP § 435(b)(1).) “The Court may, upon a motion made pursuant to
Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper:
(a) Strike out any irrelevant, false or improper matter asserted in any
pleading; (b) Strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the
Court." (CCP § 436.)
 
Defendant moves to strike allegations that refer to the “Takeover
Defendants” before Defendant Pearl 33 was formed to the extent they contain “any direct or implied reference
to Moving Defendant;” the prayers for punitive damages and attorney’s fees,
references to alter ego, and any “derivative” claims. Defendant, however,
provides virtually no analysis to support these requests. Defendant has not shown
these allegations are improper and must be stricken.
 
The motion to strike is
DENIED.

ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer to a complaint may be taken to the whole complaint or to any
of the causes of action in it.  (CCP §
430.50(a).)  A demurrer challenges only
the legal sufficiency of the complaint, not the truth of its factual
allegations or the plaintiff's ability to prove those allegations.  (Picton v. Anderson Union High Sch. Dist. (1996)
50 Cal. App. 4th 726, 732.)  The court
must treat as true the complaint's material factual allegations, but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.  (Id. at 732-33.)  The complaint is to be construed liberally to
determine whether a cause of action has been stated.  (Id. at 733.)
 
A. Derivative
v. Direct Claims
 
Defendants demur to the first, second, fourth, and seventh causes of
action for intentional and negligent misrepresentation, civil conspiracy and
breach of fiduciary duty on the ground that they are improperly pleaded
derivative claims on behalf of Cloud B.
 
Defendants assert the causes of action should have been derivative
claims because the alleged harm was to Cloud B, not to Plaintiffs as individual
shareholders. Defendants also argue the claims are barred because Cloud B
released all derivative claims in its bankruptcy action. 
 
Plaintiffs allege that Defendants as majority shareholders and officers
conspired to make Plaintiffs’ minority shares worthless. This is a recognized
exception to mandatory derivative actions. (See Jones v. H.F. Ahmanson (1969)
1 Cal.3d 93, 106.) The demurrers cannot be sustained on this basis.
 
B. Seventh
Cause of Action for Breach of Fiduciary Duty
 
Defendants contend the seventh cause of action for breach of fiduciary
duty is barred by the statute of limitations and does not relate back to the
original complaint, filed on October 27, 2020, because the claims have been
changed from derivative claims in the original complaint to direct in this FAC.
Defendant does not cite authority stating this specific amendment prohibits application
of the relation back doctrine. 
 
The demurrers to the seventh cause of action are OVERRULED.
 
C. First and
Second Causes of Action for Intentional and Negligent Misrepresentation
 
The elements of fraud are: “(a)
misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b)
knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce
reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Charnay v.
Cobert (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 184.) In California, fraud, including
negligent misrepresentation, must be pled with specificity. (Small v. Fritz
Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 184.) “The particularity demands
that a plaintiff plead facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what
means the representations were tendered.” (Cansino v. Bank of America
(2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469.)
Defendants demur to the claims for fraud on the ground that they are not
pleaded with the requisite specificity. Defendants assert Plaintiffs fail to
allege that moving Defendants made any misrepresentations. In opposition,
Plaintiffs point to misrepresentations made by other Defendants. This is
insufficient to establish fraud claims against moving Defendants.
 
The demurrers to the first and second causes of action are SUSTAINED.
 
D. Fourth Cause
of Action for Civil Conspiracy
 
“The elements of a civil conspiracy are the formation and operation of
the conspiracy and damage resulting to plaintiff from an act done in
furtherance of the common design.” (Stueve Bros. Farms, LLC v. Berger Kahn
(2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 303, 323.) Plaintiffs allege that Defendants engaged in
a conspiracy by, among other things, engaging in covert negotiations to take over
Cloud B and divulging Cloud B’s proprietary and confidential information to the
takeover Defendants. This is sufficient to allege a civil conspiracy.
 
The demurrers to the fourth cause of action are OVERRULED.
 
E. Ninth Cause
of Action for Abuse of Process
 
Defendants demur to the ninth cause of action on the ground that it is
barred by the litigation privilege. As stated in the Court’s ruling on
Defendants’ anti-SLAPP motion, the claim for abuse of process is barred and
must be stricken. The demurrers to this claim are moot.
 
F. Tenth and
Eleventh Causes of Action for Declaratory Relief
 
Plaintiffs ask the Court to determine whether certain statements made by
Plaintiffs were “defamatory,” as alleged in Defendants’ now-dismissed complaint
against Plaintiffs in Pennsylvania. Defendants assert Plaintiffs cannot seek declaratory
relief because there is no ongoing or prospective conflict between the parties.
The Court agrees. 
 
The demurrers to the tenth and eleventh causes of action are SUSTAINED.

BACKGROUND
 
On July 5, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the
operative first amended complaint against Defendants, asserting causes of
action for intentional and negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary
duty, breach of contract, conspiracy, malicious prosecution, and abuse of
process. Plaintiffs were minority shareholders of Cloud B. Plaintiffs allege
the Defendant majority shareholders conspired with the takeover Defendants to
sell Cloud B and loot Cloud B’s assets, making Plaintiffs’ shares worthless. 
 
REQUESTS FOR
JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
Defendants’ request for judicial notice
is GRANTED.
 
ANALYSIS
 
In ruling on a
special motion to strike pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section
425.16, or anti-SLAPP motion, the court applies a two-prong test. First, the
court determines whether the moving defendant has met his or her burden to
establish that the “challenged cause of action is one arising from protected
activity.” (Equilon Enterprises, L.L.C. v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002)
29 Cal.4th 53, 66.) The moving defendant meets this burden by demonstrating
that “the act or acts of which the plaintiff complains were taken ‘in
furtherance of the [defendant]'s right of petition or free speech under the
United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue,’ as
defined in the statute.” (Id.) 
 
The court then
moves to the second prong, in which the burden shifts to Plaintiff to
demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the merits of the complaint. (Id.)
“To establish such a probability, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the
complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie
showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by
the plaintiff is credited.” (Matson v. Dvorak (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 539,
548.) “Only a cause of action that satisfies both prongs of the anti-SLAPP
statute—i.e., that arises from protected speech or petitioning and lacks even
minimal merit—is a SLAPP, subject to being stricken under the statute.” (Navellier
v. Sletten (2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 89.)
 
A. Protected Activity
 
Defendants move to strike portions of the fourth cause of action for
civil conspiracy and the entire ninth cause of action for abuse of process on
the ground that they are based on Defendants’ protected petitioning activity. These
claims arise from Defendants’ filing and pursuit of a lawsuit and bankruptcy
proceedings in Pennsylvania. Plaintiffs do not dispute that these allegations
arise from protected activity. The burden shifts to Plaintiffs to establish a
probability of success on the merits.
 
B. Probability
of Success on the Merits
 
“To establish such a probability, a plaintiff
must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by
a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if
the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.” (Matson, supra 40
Cal.App.4th at 548.) “Only a cause of action that satisfies both prongs of the
anti-SLAPP statute—i.e., that arises from protected speech or petitioning and
lacks even minimal merit—is a SLAPP, subject to being stricken under the
statute.” (Navellier, supra 29 Cal.4th at 89.)
Defendants assert that Plaintiffs
cannot show a probability of success on the merits because Defendants’
communications relating to the Pennsylvania lawsuit are protected by the
litigation privilege. The Court of Appeal has explained the litigation
privilege as follows:  
 
Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b),
a codification of the litigation privilege, provides that, “A privileged
publication or broadcast is one made: [¶] ... [¶] (b) In any (1) legislative
proceeding, (2) judicial proceeding, (3) in any other official proceeding
authorized by law, or (4) in the initiation or course of any other proceeding
authorized by law and reviewable pursuant to Chapter 2....” “ ‘The purposes
of section 47, subdivision (b), are to afford litigants and witnesses free
access to the courts without fear of being harassed subsequently by derivative
tort actions, to encourage open channels of communication and zealous advocacy,
to promote complete and truthful testimony, to give finality to judgments, and
to avoid unending litigation. [Citation.] To effectuate these purposes, the
litigation privilege is absolute and applies regardless of malice. [Citation.]
Moreover, “[i]n furtherance of the public policy purposes it is designed to
serve, the privilege prescribed by section 47[, subdivision (b) ] has been
given broad application.” [Citation.]’ ” (Komarova v. National Credit
Acceptance, Inc. (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 324, 336, 95 Cal.Rptr.3d
880.) 
 
“Although originally enacted with
reference to defamation [citation], the privilege is now held applicable to any
communication, whether or not it amounts to a publication [citations], and
all torts except malicious prosecution. [Citations.] ... [¶] The usual
formulation is that the privilege applies to any communication (1) made in
judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by litigants or other participants
authorized by law; (3) to achieve the objects of the litigation; and (4) that
have some connection or logical relation to the action. [Citations.]” (Silberg
v. Anderson (1990) 50 Cal.3d 205, 212, 266 Cal.Rptr. 638, 786 P.2d
365; see Action Apartment Assn., Inc. v. City of Santa Monica (2007)
41 Cal.4th 1232, 1241, 63 Cal.Rptr.3d 398, 163 P.3d 89; La Jolla Group
II v. Bruce (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 461, 472, 149 Cal.Rptr.3d 716.)
 
(Tom Jones
Enterprises, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 1283,
1293-4.) 
 
Plaintiffs allege that Defendants abused the
legal process by “knowingly and
maliciously filing the CLOUD B bankruptcy in an improper venue;” “knowingly and
maliciously filing the Malicious Pennsylvania Action in an improper venue;” “filing
false and misleading documents with both the California Secretary of State and
the Pennsylvania bankruptcy court;” “knowingly and maliciously propounding
meritless discovery and refusing to respond to otherwise proper discovery;” and
“knowingly and maliciously filing a meritless Motion to Dismiss in an attempt
to obtain a dismissal without prejudice properly dismissed with prejudice.”
(FAC ¶
171.) 
California
courts have held that malicious prosecution is exempt from the litigation
privilege but abuse of process is not. (See Abraham v. Lancaster Community Hospital (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 796, 824-825.) Plaintiffs’
claims for abuse of process and civil conspiracy seek redress for Defendants’
communicative conduct in a legal proceeding; they are barred by the litigation
privilege.
In
opposition, Plaintiffs assert that the Court must follow Pennsylvania law
because Plaintiffs allege Defendants abused the court system in Pennsylvania.
Plaintiffs represent that under Pennsylvania law abuse of process is recognized
exception to the litigation privilege. But Plaintiffs provide no California
authority stating that the Court must follow Pennsylvania law. 
Plaintiffs
also argue that the claims at issue arise from Defendants’ conduct, rather than
Defendants’ privileged communications. As discussed, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants
abused the legal process by filing pleadings and motions, serving discovery,
and making false statements in documents filed with the Pennsylvania courts. This
is communicative conduct protected by the litigation privilege. 
Plaintiffs
have failed to establish a probability of success on the merits. Defendants’
anti-SLAPP is GRANTED.
