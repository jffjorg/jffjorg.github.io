SUMMARY OF
ACTION
On May 31, 2023,
Plaintiff Raul Gutierrez (Plaintiff) served Defendant Hector Vidal-Ramirez (Defendant)
with Form Interrogatories, Set One. Defendant’s responses were due on July 5,
2023. On August 11, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel file a motion to compel
Defendant’s responses to the Form Interrogatories. On December 12, 2023, this
Court granted Plaintiff’s motion and ruled that Defendant must serve the
response within 10 days. On January 8, 2024, Defendant served his responses to
the Form Interrogatories. The next day, Defense Counsel served the executed
verification form. On January 15, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel met and conferred
with Defense Counsel regarding the deficiencies with Defendant’s responses. Plaintiff
requested that amended verified responses be served no later than January 29,
2024. On January 29, Defense Counsel request a 14-day extension, which
Plaintiff’s counsel granted. On February 16, 2024, Defendant served unverified supplemental
responses to Plaintiff’s interrogatories. On February 20 and 21, Plaintiff
informed Defendant that Plaintiff did not receive Defendant’s verification. On
February 26, 2024, Defendant again served Amended Responses to the Form
Interrogatories, but these were also unverified. 
 
Plaintiff filed
this motion on March 8, 2024. Plaintiff seeks an order compelling Defendant to
serve verified responses. Plaintiff also seeks sanctions in the amount of $500.00
against Defendant and/or Defendant’s counsel of record for having to bring the
motion.
 
On March 15,
2024, Defendant filed an opposition indicating that he served verified amended
responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories via email on March 7, 2024.
Defendant indicates that the late service was due to internal clerical issues
at his counsel’s law firm. Defendant also requests that sanctions be imposed
against his counsel’s law firm only. No reply has been filed.
 
ANALYSIS
If a party to
whom interrogatories were directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and a monetary sanction.
(CCP § 2030.290(b); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.)
 
Though
untimely, Defendant has now served verified responses to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories, Set One. Plaintiff did not file a reply, so there is no
indication that the responses were inadequate. Therefore, the Court will not
issue an order compelling further responses to the interrogatories. However, as
discussed below, sanctions will be imposed on Defendant’s counsel.
 
Sanctions
When a party
files a motion to compel responses to interrogatories, the Court shall award
monetary sanctions to the prevailing party – unless the adverse party opposes
the motion “with substantial justification” or otherwise determines that the
imposition of sanctions would be “unjust.” (CCP § 2030.290(c).)
 
Plaintiff has
requested sanctions in the amount of $500.00 against Defendant and/or Defendant’s
counsel of record for having to bring this motion. The amount that Plaintiff
has requested appears to be reasonable for this motion.
 
Defendant’s
counsel has requested that the sanctions be imposed against Defendant’s
counsel’s firm, Martinez, Dieterich & Zarcone Legal Group, only, and not
against Defendant. The Court will honor this request
 
Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions against Defendant’s counsel of record is granted in the
amount of $500.00 for this motion.
 
ORDER
1.      Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories is denied as moot.
2.      Defendant’s
counsel of record is ordered to pay sanctions in the total amount of $500.00. Defendant’s
counsel of record is ordered to pay these sanctions to Plaintiff’s counsel
within twenty (20) days.
