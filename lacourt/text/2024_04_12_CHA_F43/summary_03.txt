The tentative ruling is a summary of the proceedings in the case number 23CHCV00886 between Raul Gutierrez, et al. (Plaintiff) and Hector Vidal-Ramirez, et al. (Defendant). The Plaintiff filed a motion to compel further responses to the Defendant's Form Interrogatories, as well as sanctions. The Defendant failed to serve timely responses and eventually served unverified responses. The Plaintiff sought sanctions in the amount of $500.00 against the Defendant and/or Defendant's counsel of record. The Court granted the motion for sanctions in the amount of $500.00 against Defendant's counsel of record, Martinez, Dieterich & Zarcone Legal Group. The Court denied the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses as moot since the Defendant has now served verified responses.
