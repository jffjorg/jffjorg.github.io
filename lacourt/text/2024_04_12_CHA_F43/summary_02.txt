Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has granted Plaintiff Cecilia Thompson's motion to compel responses to Defendant White House Recover and Detox LLC's Requests for Production. Defendant failed to respond to the requests and did not have a valid excuse for not responding. The court also granted Plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $665. The sanctions are for the cost of preparing the motion to compel and for the court's time spent on the matter.
