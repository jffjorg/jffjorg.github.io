Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denied the defendant's motion to quash the service of summons, citing that the defendant's evidence was not strong enough to rebut the presumption of proper service of summons. The judge also found that the defendant's motion was untimely, as it was filed more than two years after the entry of the default judgment, and that the defendant failed to show diligence in seeking to set aside the default judgment.
