  Case Number:  22BBCV00432    Hearing Date:   January 21, 2025    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT CITY OF  BURBANKS’ MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL to SEPTEMBER 16, 2025I.          INTRODUCTION This is a breach of contract action  related to a public works project. Plaintiff VCI Utility Services, LLC  (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant City of Burbank (“City”) on  June 13, 2022. Plaintiff alleges that the City breached its contract by failing  to disclose material facts regarding the site conditions and by refusing to pay  for differing site conditions encountered during the project.  On August 15, 2022, Plaintiff filed  its First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), which added a second cause of action for  violation of the California Public Contract Code. On July 8, 2024, Plaintiff  filed its Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against the City, asserting claims  for (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Violation of the California Public Contract  Code; and (3) Prompt Payment Violation. The SAC was deemed filed by the  Court. (Min. Order, 07/08/24.)  On October 29, 2024, the Court granted a  motion to continue the trial to May 6, 2025. Currently before the Court is the City’s Motion to Continue  Trial, filed on December 19, 2024. On December 27, 2024, the Court granted the  City’s ex parte application to advance the hearing on the Motion, and Plaintiff  filed its opposition on the same day. II.        LEGAL STANDARD             California  Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subdivision (c) states that although disfavored,  the trial date may be continued for “good cause,” which includes (without  limitation): (1) unavailability of trial counsel or witnesses due to “death,  illness, or other excusable circumstances”; (2) the addition of a new party  depriving the new party (or other parties) from conducting discovery and  preparing for trial; (3) “excused inability to obtain essential testimony,  documents, or other material evidence despite diligent efforts”; or (4) “[a]  significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case” preventing it from  being ready for trial. (Id., Rule 3.1332(c).)¿  Other relevant considerations may  include: “(1) The proximity of the trial date; [¶] (2) Whether there was any  previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party;  [¶] (3) The length of the continuance requested; [¶] (4) The availability of  alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion or  application for a continuance; [¶] (5) The prejudice that parties or witnesses  will suffer as a result of the continuance; [¶] (6) If the case is entitled to  a preferential trial setting, the reasons for that status and whether the need  for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; [¶] (7)¿The court's  calendar and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending trials; [¶]  (8) Whether trial counsel is engaged in another trial; [¶] (9) Whether all  parties have stipulated to a continuance; [¶] (10) Whether the interests of  justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by  imposing conditions on the continuance; and [¶] (11) Any other fact or  circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or application.”  (Id., Rule 3.1332(d).)¿  Code of Civil Procedure section  2024.050 allows a court to grant leave to complete discovery proceedings. In  doing so, a court shall consider matters relevant to the leave requested,  including, but not limited to: (1) the necessity of the discovery, (2) the  diligence in seeking the discovery or discovery motion, (3) the likelihood of  interference with the trial calendar or prejudice to a party, and (4) the  length of time that has elapsed between previous trial dates. (Code Civ. Proc.  § 2024.050.)  III.      ANALYSIS City moves to continue trial and associated  deadlines by 90 days, citing difficulties in obtaining adequate discovery  responses from Plaintiff and the need to file a motion for summary adjudication  as to Plaintiff’s retention allegations set forth in the Second Amended  Complaint (SAC). Specifically, City argues that good  cause exists because Plaintiff’s conduct since the IDC on September 11, 2024,  has been unreasonably obstructive. Plaintiff has refused to stipulate to a  continuance or provide adequate discovery responses. When Plaintiff responded  to discovery on December 10, 2024, its responses included objections to  straightforward interrogatories and the production of 4,638 unsorted and  incomplete documents that lack metadata and were missing attachments referenced  in emails (Motion, p. 3; Aguado Decl., ¶ 15) City sent a meet-and-confer letter  to Plaintiff on December 11, 2024, requesting further responses to discovery  and a stipulation to a trial continuance. However, Plaintiff refused to comply  with either request (Motion, p. 4; Aguado Decl., ¶¶ 16-18). City also emphasizes that  Plaintiff’s discovery practices prevent it from filing a motion for summary  adjudication by the statutory deadline of January 13, 2025 (Motion, p. 4;  Aguado Decl., ¶ 19). Given these circumstances, City contends that a continuance  is necessary to address the discovery deficiencies, attend the scheduled IDC on  January 16, 2025, and, if needed, file discovery motions (Motion, p. 4). In opposition, Plaintiff argues  that City has failed to show good cause to continue the trial date. Plaintiff  contends that City has not acted diligently, waiting over four months after  Plaintiff filed its SAC to propound discovery requests (Opposition, p. 4; Cowan  Decl., ¶ 6). Plaintiff further asserts that City already possesses all the  information necessary to file its motion for summary adjudication, as Plaintiff  has produced all relevant documents and exhibits, including those identified  for trial in July 2024, and City has failed to articulate what additional  evidence it seeks (Opposition, p. 5) Additionally, Plaintiff argues that  a continuance would prejudice Plaintiff by delaying resolution of the case and  increasing litigation costs (Opposition, p. 6). Plaintiff also contends that  the City’s repeated motions and inconsistent positions are a tactic to delay  trial and hinder Plaintiff’s ability to proceed efficiently (Opposition, p. 7) The Court finds that good cause  exists to continue the trial based on the following: First, Plaintiff’s  production of discovery, including objections to interrogatories and the  production of 4,638 unsorted and incomplete documents, has hindered the City’s  ability to prepare the motion for summary adjudication. Under California Rules  of Court, rule 3.1332(c)(3), good cause for a continuance may include an  inability to obtain essential evidence despite diligent efforts. The volume and  format of the production raise concerns regarding its adequacy for use in  dispositive motion practice, particularly given the statutory filing deadline  of January 13, 2025. Second, the statutory deadline for  filing motions limits the City’s ability to resolve discovery disputes and meet  procedural requirements. City sent a meet-and-confer letter on December 11,  2024, requesting further responses and seeking Plaintiff’s stipulation to a  trial continuance. This demonstrates an effort to address discovery issues  prior to the upcoming January 16, 2025, IDC. The proximity of the deadlines  weighs in favor of a continuance. Finally, a 90-day continuance would  allow the parties sufficient time to address outstanding discovery disputes and  prepare for trial. The requested delay is limited and would not unduly  prejudice Plaintiff. California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d) permits the  Court to consider factors such as the proximity of the trial date, prior  continuances, and the interests of justice in determining whether to grant a  continuance. Here, the Court finds that these factors support the City’s  request. Based on the foregoing, the Court  GRANTS the City’s motion to continue trial. Trial is continued to September 8,  2025. All motion and discovery cutoff dates related to the SAC shall be based  on the new trial date. City to give notice.               IV.       CONCLUSION City’s motion to  continue the trial is GRANTED. The trial is continued to September 16, 2025. Final status conference is continued to September 4, 2025.  All  motion and discovery cutoff dates related to the SAC shall be based on the new  trial date. Defendant is to give notice.          Dated: January 21, 2025                                                                                                             JARED  D.
