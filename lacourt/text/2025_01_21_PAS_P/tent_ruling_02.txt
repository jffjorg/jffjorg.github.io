 Case Number:  23AHCV01224    Hearing Date:   January 21, 2025    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS’
MOTIONS TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO FORM INTERROGATORIES - SET ONEI.               
INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff Carlos Aragundi (“Plaintiff”) brings this action against
Defendants Jeff Chilin and Dennis Chilin (“Defendants”) asserting claims for
(1) Strict Liability, (2) Negligence, and (3) Premises Liability. The complaint
arises from an alleged dog attack on May 30, 2021, at Defendants’ property
located at 119 S. Altadena Drive, Pasadena, California.
On December 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed two motions to compel each
Defendant to serve verified responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One.
Plaintiff alleges that the interrogatories were served on October 18, 2023, and
that Defendants failed to provide timely responses by the statutory deadline of
November 20, 2023. Both motions are unopposed. The Court consolidates both
motions into the following tentative.
            II.        LEGAL
STANDARD
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290(a), if a party fails to
respond to interrogatories, they waive any objections, including those based on
privilege or work product protection. When a party does not provide timely
responses, the propounding party is entitled to move for an order compelling
responses. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290(b), the Court
must order the responding party to provide responses without objections.
III.  ANALYSIS
Plaintiff Carlos Aragundi moves
for an order compelling Defendants Jeff Chilin and Dennis Chilin to respond to
Form Interrogatories, Set One, No. 1, 1, 2.1 - 2.2, 2.4 - 2.10, 2.12 – 2.13,
4.1, 4.2, 12.1 – 12.7, 13.1 – 13.2, 15.1, 16.1 – 16.6, 16.9 – 16.10, and 17.1.
Plaintiff served these discovery requests on October 18, 2023, with responses
due on November 20, 2023. (Webster Decl., ¶¶ 2-3, Ex. A.) Defendants failed to
serve any responses, objections, or production by the statutory deadline and
have not sought an extension or relief from their failure to respond. (Webster
Decl., ¶¶ 4–6.) Despite Plaintiff’s attempts to resolve the matter informally
through phone calls and emails, Defendants did not provide any responses.
(Webster Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. B.) These motions are unopposed.
 Accordingly, the Court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendants Form Interrogatories - Set One, No. 1,
2.1 - 2.2, 2.4 - 2.10, 2.12 – 2.13, 4.1, 4.2, 12.1 – 12.7, 13.1 – 13.2, 15.1,
16.1 – 16.6, 16.9 – 16.10, and 17.1.
VI.       CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel
responses to Form Interrogatories - Set One. Defendants ordered to respond
within 20 days of this order.
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice.
