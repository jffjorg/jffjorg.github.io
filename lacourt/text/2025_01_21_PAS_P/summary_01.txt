The City argued that the Plaintiff's production of discovery was incomplete and unsorted, hindering its ability to prepare a motion for summary adjudication. The Court found that good cause exists to continue the trial based on the Plaintiff's production of discovery and the need for the City to file a motion for summary adjudication. The requested 90-day continuance would allow the parties sufficient time to address outstanding discovery disputes and prepare for trial. The Court also took into account the proximity of the trial date, prior continuances, and the interests of justice in determining whether to grant the motion.
