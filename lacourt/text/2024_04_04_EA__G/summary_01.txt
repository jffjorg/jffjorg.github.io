**Summary**
The court rules on General Motors's motion to strike IWS's memorandum of costs. The court grants the motion in part and strikes $979.99 in costs from IWS's requested award of $2,961.41 for a total award of $1,981.42. The court finds that IWS's costs incurred in the filing of discovery motions and terminating sanctions motion were reasonable and necessary, but declines to award costs for a deposition that should have been rescheduled and should not have gone forward.
