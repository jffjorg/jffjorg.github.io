And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has overruled Maserati's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Heqian Zhang, alleges that Maserati failed to adequately repair or replace his 2023 Maserati Grecale, which he purchased in July 2023. The complaint alleges violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and Business and Professions Code section 17200. The court finds that the complaint adequately alleges the required elements of a cause of action under section 17200, including a loss or deprivation of money or property sufficient to qualify as injury in fact, and that the economic injury was caused by Maserati's alleged unfair business practices. The court therefore overrules Maserati's demurrer and orders Maserati to file its answer to the complaint within 10 days.
