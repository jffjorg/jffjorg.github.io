Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Flexibility Capital, Inc.’s Application for
Default Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a breach of contract action arising from a future receivables sales agreement.
In November 2022, Plaintiff Flexibility Capital, Inc. (Flexibility Capital)
entered into a written agreement with Defendant Enner Alexy Cruz Leon, doing
business as Universal Marble Granite & Tile, in which Flexibility Capital agreed
to purchase $36,500 in future receipts for a price of $25,000 from Cruz Leon.
In support of the agreement, Cruz Leon executed a personal guaranty. In
December 2022, Flexibility Capital alleges Cruz Leon breached the agreement by
failing to pay the entire balance owed.
On November
6, 2023, Flexibility Capital filed a complaint against Cruz Leon and Does
1-100, alleging the following causes of action: (1) breach of contract, (2)
breach of personal guaranty, and (3) unjust enrichment. On November 24,
Flexibility Capital’s process server served Cruz Leon with substitute service
in La Puente.
On February
1, 2024, default was entered against Cruz Leon. On March 18, 2024, Flexibility
Capital submitted the present application for default judgment.
A case
management conference is set for April 4, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)

Flexibility
Capital seeks default judgment against Cruz Leon in the total amount of $38,305.70,
including $32,875.50 in damages, $4,896.20 in interest, and $534 in costs. Because
the court finds Flexibility Capital has submitted sufficient evidence, the
court GRANTS Flexibility Capital’s application for default judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Flexibility Capital’s application for
default judgment is GRANTED.
