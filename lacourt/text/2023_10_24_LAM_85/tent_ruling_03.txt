 Case Number:  23STCV17631    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2023    Dept:  85 
Allegiant Partners Inc.
v. Johnathan Magallanes et al, 23STCV17631
Tentative decision on application
for writ of possession and turnover order: granted



 
            
            
Plaintiff Allegiant Partners Inc. (“Allegiant”) seeks a writ
of possession against Defendant Johnathan Magallanes (“Magallanes”),
individually and doing business as Johnathan Magallanes Trucking, to recover a 2015
Freightliner Cascadia, Vehicle Identification Number 1FUJGEBG8FLGT7809 (“Vehicle”).  
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers (no opposition was filed) and
renders the following tentative decision.
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            Plaintiff
Allegiant filed the Complaint against Defendant Magallanes on July 23, 2023,
alleging causes of action for (1) breach of written finance agreement, (2)
breach of personal guaranty, (3) foreclosure of security and possession of
collateral, (4) open book account, (5) account stated, (6) unjust enrichment,
(7) claim and delivery, and (8) conversion. 
The Complaint alleges in pertinent part as follows. 
            On
March
25, 2022, Allegiant and Magallanes executed a written Equipment
Finance Agreement (“Agreement”) to finance the purchase of the Vehicle,
which was collateral.  Magallanes was required
to make monthly payments as outlined in the Agreement.  To induce Allegiant’s entry into the
Agreement, Magallanes executed a Continuing Guaranty (“Guaranty”) for the
full amount owed thereunder.
            Magallanes
breached the Agreement on February 26, 2023 by failing to make
the monthly installment due.  Allegiant has
exercised its right under the Agreement to accelerate the balance owed.  As of filing the Complaint, Magallanes owes a
principal balance of $44,315.54, late charges of $943.15, accruing taxes and fees,
and attorney’s fees incurred through this action.  The principal balance accrues interest at an 18%
annual rate.
            Allegiant
seeks damages of $44,315.54 plus 18% annual interest, late charges of $943.15,
recoverable fees or taxes, and attorney’s fees and costs.  Alternatively, under the cause of action for open
book account, Allegiant seeks $44,315.54 plus 10% annual interest and costs of
suit.  Allegiant also seeks recovery of
the Vehicle or its market value.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings 
            On
August 4, 2023, Allegiant served Magallanes with the Complaint, Summons, and
moving papers by substitute service, effective August 14, 2023.
            On
September 26, 2023, Department 14 (Hon. Cherol Nellon) entered default against Magallanes.  
 
            B.
Applicable Law
            A
writ of possession is issued as a provisional remedy in a cause of action for
claim and delivery, also known as replevin. 
See Pillsbury, Madison
& Sutro v. Schectman, (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1288.  As a provisional remedy, the right to
possession is only temporary, and title and the right to possess are determined
in the final judgment.  
            A
writ of possession is available in any pending action.  It also is available where an action has been
stayed pending arbitration, so long as the arbitration award may be ineffectual
without provisional relief.  See CCP §1281.7. 
 
            1. Procedure
            Upon
the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, a plaintiff may apply
for an order for a writ of possession. 
Unlike attachment, where Judicial Council forms are optional, the
parties must use the mandatory approved Judicial Council forms in a claim and
delivery proceeding.  (Judicial Council
Forms CD-100 et seq.).
            A
plaintiff must make a written application for a writ of possession.  CCP §512.010(a), (b); (Mandatory Form
CD-100); CCP §512.010(a).  A verified
complaint alone is insufficient.  6
Witkin, California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §255, p.203.  The application may be supported by
declarations and/or a verified complaint. 
CCP §516.030.  The declarations or
complaint must set forth admissible evidence except where expressly permitted
to be shown on information and belief.  Id.
            The
application must be executed under oath and include: (1) A showing of the basis
of the plaintiff's claim and that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of
the property claimed.  If the plaintiff's
claim is based on a written instrument, a copy of it must be attached; (2) A
showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, how the
defendant came into possession of it, and, the reasons for the detention based
on the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief; (3) A specific
description of the property and statement of its value; (4) The location of the
property according to the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and
belief.  If the property, or some part of
it, is within a private place which may have to be entered to take possession,
a showing of probable cause to believe that the property is located there; and
(5) A statement that the property has not been taken for (a) a tax, assessment,
or fine, pursuant to a statute, or (b) an execution against the plaintiff’s
property.  Alternatively, a statement
that if the property was seized for one of these purposes, it is by statute
exempt from such seizure.  CCP §512.010(b).
 
            2. The Hearing
            Before
noticing a hearing, the plaintiff must serve the defendant with all of the
following: (1) A copy of the summons and complaint; (2) A Notice of Application
and Hearing; and (3) A copy of the application and any supporting
declaration.  CCP §512.030(a).  If the defendant has not appeared in the action,
service must be made in the same manner as service of summons and
complaint.  CCP §512.030(b).
            Each
party shall file with the court and serve upon the other party any declarations
and points and authorities intended to be relied upon at the hearing.  CCP §512.050. 
At the hearing, the court decides the merits of the application based on
the pleadings and declarations.   Id.  Upon a showing of good cause, the court may
receive and consider additional evidence and authority presented at the
hearing, or may continue the hearing for the production of such additional
evidence, oral or documentary, or the filing of other affidavits or points and
authorities.  Id.  
            The
court may order issuance of a writ of possession if both of the following are
found: (1) The plaintiff has established the probable validity of the
plaintiff’s claim to possession of the property; and (2) The undertaking
requirements of CCP section 515.010 are satisfied.  CCP §512.060(a).  “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is
more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the
defendant on that claim.”  CCP
§511.090.  This requires that the
plaintiff establish a prima facie case; the writ shall not issue if the
defendant shows a reasonable probability of a successful defense to the claim
and delivery cause of action.  Witkin,
California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §261, p.208.  A defendant’s claim of defect in the property
is not a defense to the plaintiff’s right to possess it.  RCA Service Co. v. Superior Court, (1982)
137 Cal.App.3d 1, 3.
            No
writ directing the levying officer to enter a private place to take possession
of any property may be issued unless the plaintiff has established that there
is probable cause to believe that the property is located there.  CCP §512.060(b).  
            The
successful plaintiff may obtain a preliminary injunction containing the same
provisions as a TRO that remains in effect until the property is seized by the
levying officer.[1]  CCP §513.010(c).  
            The
court may also issue a “turnover order” directing the defendant to transfer
possession of the property to the plaintiff (See Mandatory Form CD-120). 
The order must notify the defendant that failure to comply may subject
him or her to contempt of court.  CCP
§512.070.  The turnover remedy is not
issued in lieu of a writ, but in conjunction with it to provide the plaintiff
with a less expensive means of obtaining possession.  See
Edwards v Superior Court, (“Edwards”) (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 173,
178.
 
            3. The Plaintiff’s Undertaking
            Generally,
the court cannot issue an order for a writ of possession until the plaintiff
has filed an undertaking with the court (Mandatory Form CD-140 for personal
sureties).  CCP §515.010(a).  The undertaking shall provide that the
sureties are bound to the defendant for the return of the property to the
defendant, if return of the property is ordered, and for the payment to the
defendant of any sum recovered against the plaintiff.  Id. 
The undertaking shall be in an amount not less than twice the value of
the defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.  Id. 
The value of the defendant's interest in the property is determined by
the market value of the property less the amount due and owing on any
conditional sales contract or security agreement and all liens and encumbrances
on the property, and any other factors necessary to determine the defendant’s
interest in the property.  Id.
            However,
where the defendant has no interest in the property, the court must waive the requirement
of the plaintiff’s undertaking and include in the order for issuance of the
writ the amount of the defendant’s undertaking sufficient to satisfy the
requirements of CCP section 515.020(b).  CCP
§515.010(b). 
 
            C. Statement of Facts
            On
March 25, 2022, Allegiant and Magallanes executed the Agreement to finance the
purchase of the Vehicle, which is collateral securing the Agreement.  Jueschke Decl., ¶4, Ex. 1.  Under the Agreement, Magallanes was required to
make one $4,400 payment on March 25, 2022, and 35 monthly payments of $1,886.27
thereafter.  Jueschke Decl., ¶4, Ex.
1.  
            Upon
Magallanes’s default for failure to pay amounts due, Allegiant has the right to
assess a 10% late charge, accelerate the amount owed, and demand assembly and
return of the Vehicle.  Jueschke Decl.,
¶4, Ex. 1.  The accelerated principal
would accrue interest at 18% per year.  Jueschke
Decl., ¶4, Ex. 1.  Magallanes also agreed
to reimburse Allegiant for all attorney’s fees and legal expenses incurred to
enforce the Agreement.  Jueschke Decl., ¶12,
Ex. 1.  
            To
induce Allegiant’s entry into the Agreement, Magallanes signed the Guaranty for
the full amount owed thereunder.  Jueschke
Decl., ¶13, Ex. 2.  Allegiant perfected
its interest in the Vehicle via a Certificate of Title identifying it as
lienholder.  Jueschke Decl., ¶18, Ex. 3.
            Magallanes
breached the Agreement on February 26, 2023 by failing to make
the monthly installment due.  Jueschke Decl.,
¶6.  Allegiant has exercised its right to
accelerate the balance owed.  Jueschke
Decl., ¶6.  Based on a Statement of
Account dated July 17, 2023, Magallanes owes a principal balance of $44,315.54,
late charges of $943.15, accruing taxes and fees, and attorney’s fees incurred
through this action.  Jueschke Decl., ¶¶
8-12, 24, Ex. 5.  The principal balance
will accrue interest at an 18% annual rate. 
Jueschke Decl., ¶8.  
            The
Agreement lists Magallanes’s address as 1106 N. Ditman Ave., Los Angeles, CA
90063.  Jueschke Decl., ¶21, Ex. 1.  Allegiant believes the Vehicle is at this
location.  Jueschke Decl., ¶21.  Demands for the Vehicle have failed.  Jueschke Decl., ¶19.
            The
PriceDigests
Guide lists the Vehicle’s wholesale value as $33,983, average trade-in
value as $34,802, and retail value as $40,943. 
Jueschke Decl., ¶22, Ex. 4.
 
            D. Analysis
            Plaintiff
Allegiant seeks a writ of possession and turnover order against Magallanes,
both individually and doing business as Johnathan Magallanes Trucking, for the Vehicle.
            
            1.
Breach of Agreement and Guaranty
            The
Agreement provides that Magallanes was required to make one $4,400 payment on
March 25, 2022, and 35 monthly payments of $1,886.27 thereafter.  Jueschke Decl., ¶4, Ex. 1.  Upon Magallanes’s default for failure to pay
amounts due, Allegiant had the right to assess a 10% late charge, accelerate
the amount owed, and demand assembly and return of the Vehicle.  Jueschke Decl., ¶4, Ex. 1.  Allegiant perfected its security interest in
the Vehicle via a Certificate of Title identifying Allegiant as
lienholder.  Jueschke Decl., ¶18, Ex. 3.
            In seeking a writ of possession, the supporting declaration
must be set forth with particularity. 
CCP §516.030.  This means that the
plaintiff must show evidentiary facts rather than the ultimate facts commonly
found in pleadings.  A recitation of
conclusions without a foundation of evidentiary facts is insufficient.  See Rodes v. Shannon, (1961)
194 Cal.App.2d 743, 749 (declaration containing conclusions inadequate for
summary judgment); Schessler v. Keck, (1956) 138 Cal.App.2d 663, 669
(same).  All documentary evidence,
including contracts and canceled checks, must be presented in admissible form,
and admissibility as non-hearsay evidence or exception to the hearsay rule,
such as the business records exception.  Lydig
Construction, Inc. v. Martinez Steel Corp., (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th
937, 944; Pos-A-Traction, Inc., v. Kepplly-Springfield Tire Co., (C.D.
Cal. 2000) 112 F.Supp.2d, 1178, 1182.  
            Allegiant
alleges that Magallanes breached the Agreement on February 26, 2023 by failing
to make the monthly installment due.  Jueschke
Decl., ¶6.  It presents a Statement of
Account that lists a principal balance of $44,315.54 and late charges of
$943.15.  Jueschke Decl., ¶¶ 8-12, 24,
Ex. 5.  Allegiant does not explain how it
generated this Statement of Account, and it does not provide details beyond the
date of default.  Jueschke Decl., Ex.
5.  As Magallanes is in default and has
not opposed, this defect is waived.
 
            2.
Amount Owed and Undertaking
            The
undertaking shall be in an amount not less than twice the value of the
defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.  CCP §515.010(a).
            The
PriceDigests Guide lists the Vehicle’s wholesale value as $33,983, average
trade-in value as $34,802, and retail value as $40,943.  Jueschke Decl., ¶22, Ex. 4.  The $44,315.54 outstanding principal alone
exceeds all three amounts.  Jueschke
Decl., ¶8, Ex. 5.  Magallanes and Magallanes
have no interest in the Vehicle.  Allegiant
does not need to post an undertaking.
 
            3.
Redelivery
            To
prevent a plaintiff from taking possession of property pursuant to a writ of
possession when no undertaking is required, or to regain possession of property
so taken, a defendant may file an amount equal to all costs awarded to the
plaintiff and all damages that the plaintiff may sustain by reason of the loss
of possession of the property.  CCP §§
515.010(b), 515.020(b).
            Allegiant
asserts that the redelivery bond should be $45,258.69, the amount needed to
satisfy its claim under the Complaint. 
Mem. at 3.  This conflates its
damages from loss of possession of the Vehicle with its total damages in the
action.  Damages from loss of possession of the Vehicle cannot exceed the
Vehicle’s value, which is $40,943.  Jueschke Decl., ¶22, Ex. 4.  Although the Agreement also allows for
recovery of attorney’s fees incurred to recover the Vehicle, Allegiant does not
provide an estimate of those fees.  Jueschke
Decl., ¶12, Ex. 1.
            The
redelivery bond shall be the $40,943 value of the Vehicle.  
 
            4.
Order to Enter Private Property
            No
writ directing the levying officer to enter a private place to take possession
of any property may be issued unless the plaintiff has established that there
is probable cause to believe that the property is located there.  CCP §512.060(b).  
            The
Agreement shows that the probable location of the Vehicle is 1106 N. Ditman
Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90063.  Jueschke
Decl., ¶21, Ex. 1.  Allegiant can obtain
a writ that gives the levying officer permission to enter this address.  The application also asks for permission to
enter any such other location known to the Defendant.  Mem. at 3. 
Without a specific address, this request is denied.
 
            5.
Turnover Order
            Allegiant
also requests a turnover order compelling Magallanes to transfer possession of
the Vehicle.  Mem. at 2.  The court may issue a “turnover order”
directing the defendant to transfer possession of the property to the plaintiff
(See Mandatory Form CD-120).  The order must notify the defendant that
failure to comply may subject him or her to contempt of court.  CCP §512.070. 
The turnover remedy is not issued in lieu of a writ, but in conjunction
with it to provide the plaintiff with a less expensive means of obtaining
possession.  See Edwards, supra, 230 Cal.App.3d at 178.  The turnover order is granted.
 
            E.
Conclusion
            The
application for a writ of possession and turnover order for the Vehicle is granted,
with the redelivery bond set at $40,943. 
The levying officer may enter 1106 N. Ditman Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90063
and any
public or commercial address.
