Here is a brief summary of the tentative ruling:

The court grants Allegiant Partners Inc.'s application for a writ of possession and turnover order for a 2015 Freightliner Cascadia, Vehicle Identification Number 1FUJGEBG8FLGT7809, which is collateral securing a finance agreement. The agreement was breached by Johnathan Magallanes, individually and doing business as Johnathan Magallanes Trucking, who failed to make monthly payments. The court finds that Allegiant has established the probable validity of its claim to possession of the property and that the undertaking requirements are satisfied. The court sets the redelivery bond at $40,943, which is the value of the Vehicle. The levying officer is authorized to enter 1106 N. Ditman Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90063 and any public or commercial address to take possession of the Vehicle. The court also grants a turnover order compelling Magallanes to transfer possession of the Vehicle to Allegiant.
