  Case Number:  22STCP02661    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2023    Dept:  85 
United Water
Conservation District v. California Fish and Game Commission, 22STCP02661

Tentative decision on petition
for writ of mandate:  denied



 
            
Petitioner United Water Conservation District (“District”) seeks
a writ of mandate compelling Respondent California Fish and Game Commission
(“Commission”) to vacate (1) its approval of Intervenor California Trout’s
(“CalTrout”) petition to list the Southern California steelhead (Oncorhynchus
mykiss or O. mykiss) as an endangered species under the California
Endangered Species Act (“CESA”), and (2) its adoption of a regulation during
the O. mykiss's candidacy period (“2084 Exception”).
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, oppositions from the
Commission and the Intervenors[1],
and consolidated reply, and renders the following tentative decision.
 
            A.
Statement of the Case
            1. Petition
            Petitioner
District commenced this proceeding on July 18, 2022 against Respondent Commission
alleging traditional and administrative mandamus.  The Petition alleges in pertinent part as
follows.
            CESA
(Fish & Game (“F&G”) Code §2050 et seq.), was enacted to
conserve, protect, restore, and enhance any endangered species or any
threatened species and its habitat. 
F&G Code section 2070 requires the Commission to establish a list of
endangered species and a list of threatened species.  A “threatened species” is a native species or
subspecies of bird, mammal, fish, amphibian, reptile, or plant that, although
not presently threatened with extinction, is likely to become an endangered
species in the foreseeable future in the absence of required special protection
and management efforts.  F&G Code §2067.  A “candidate species” is a native species or
subspecies of a bird, mammal, fish, amphibian, reptile, or plant which the
Commission has formally noticed as under review by the Department of Fish and
Wildlife (“DFW”) for addition to either the list of endangered species or the
list of threatened species, or for which the Commission has published a notice
of proposed regulation to add to either list. 
F&G Code §2068.  
            Any
interested party can submit a petition to list a species under CESA.  The species becomes a candidate species once
the Commission accepts the petition for consideration and publishes a notice of
findings accepting it.  
            Upon
receipt of a listing petition, the Commission forwards the listing petition to
DFW for an evaluation report assessing whether the petition provides sufficient
scientific information for each of the 12 required informational data sets to
indicate that listing may be warranted. 
After DFW recommends that the Commission either reject or accept the petition,
the Commission must hold a noticed public hearing to receive the report and
consider the petition, the report, written comments, and testimony.
            If
the petition fails to include sufficient scientific information in each of the
12 data sets in F&G Code section 2072.3, the Commission must reject the
petition.  Title 14, Code of Regulations
(“CCR”) §670.1(b), (e)(1).  A petition
has sufficient information on a data set if that amount of information, when
considered with DFW’s written report and the comments received, would lead a
reasonable person to conclude that the petitioned action may be warranted.
            If
the Commission approves the listing petition for consideration, the subject
species becomes a candidate species and is immediately granted CESA protections
during the 12-month candidacy period. 
The Commission can craft exceptions to this broad protection (“2084 exceptions”)
such as by authorizing the taking of any candidate species subject to terms and
conditions it prescribes that are based on the best available scientific
information.  
            After
the Commission approves the listing petition for consideration, DFW has 12
months to prepare a more detailed and peer-reviewed evaluation report and
recommendation to the Commission.  The
Commission must then hold another noticed public hearing for final
consideration of the listing petition.
            On
June 7, 2021, CalTrout submitted a petition to list the Southern California
steelhead (O. mykiss) (“steelhead”) as an endangered species under
CESA.  O. mykiss has an anadromous
form called “steelhead” and a resident form called “rainbow trout”.  Because of a rainbow trout’s ability to
express an anadromous life history, CalTrout’s petition admitted that rainbow
trout are an integral part of the steelhead population and play a central role
to the continued existence of steelhead. 
Rainbow trout are plentiful and more viable than steelhead and contribute
to the persistence of the overall species. 

The CalTrout petition only seeks to protect steelhead O.
mykiss.  The CalTrout petition
conflates the anadromous and resident forms of O. mykiss.  Almost all evidence presented in the CalTrout
petition concerned the steelhead O. mykiss.  On October 4, 2021, DFW asked CalTrout to
clarify whether it sought to list both forms of trout.  CalTrout replied that it defined the target
species as both forms of O. mykiss, but it never submitted additional
evidence that the rainbow trout faces a threat.
            DFW
recommended the CalTrout petition for the Commission’s consideration, but also acknowledged
that the petition’s information on the rainbow trout was insufficient.  DFW claimed that it had internal data on
rainbow trout but did not present any information to fill the outstanding gaps.  Multiple interested parties provided
significant evidence that the CalTrout petition failed to meet CESA’s
informational requirements.  
The Commission held a noticed public hearing for the
CalTrout petition on February 17, 2022.  At
the hearing, DFW presented only evidence about the steelhead O. mykiss.  CalTrout’s presentation acknowledged that the
anadromous and resident varieties are distinct and that the resident rainbow
trout variety has a healthy population.
            The
Commission continued the decision until its next meeting on April 20-21, 2022,
and made clear that this continuance was to consider 2084 exceptions.  District and other interested parties
submitted a proposed 2084 exception on April 7, 2022.  
            At
the April 21, 2022 hearing, the Commission approved the CalTrout petition as
having sufficient information to indicate that the petitioned action may be
warranted.  It rejected the proposed 2084
exception and passed a more limited exception that requires any take to meet
four separate requirements.  This
exception could compel projects currently required by court decree and
supervised by federal and state agencies to either reduce operations or violate
a court order.  The Office of
Administrative Law published the Commission’s findings on May 13, 2022.
            Petitioner
District seeks (1) a stay of the Commission’s action under CCP section
1094.5(g), (2) a writ of mandate compelling the Commission to vacate its
approval of the CalTrout petition for consideration of the steelhead as a
candidate species, or alternatively to vacate its approval of the limited 2084 exception,
and (3) attorney’s fees and costs.
            
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            No
proof of service is on file for the Petition.
            On
February 28, the court granted District’s motion to augment the record with 28 attachments
to an August 17, 2021 letter sent by District to DFW and the Commission.  
            On
the same date, the court heard and continued a motion to intervene by Proposed
Intervenors Center for Biological Diversity, Wishtoyo Foundation, and Ventura
Coastkeeper, warning the proposed intervenors that it will not permit
significant expansion of the issues or page limits by multiple intervenors.
            On
March 9, 2023, the court granted the motion to intervene with instructions for
the Intervenors to file a joint brief and not expand the issues.  Intervenors filed an Answer.
 
            B.
Governing Law 
            1.
CESA
            Certain
species of fish, wildlife, and plants have been rendered extinct as a
consequence of man’s activities, un-tempered by adequate concern and
conservation.  F&G Code §2051(a).  Other species of fish, wildlife, and plants
are in danger of, or threatened with, extinction because their habitats are
threatened with destruction, adverse modification, or severe curtailment, or
because of overexploitation, disease, predation, or other factors.  F&G Code §2051(b).  These species of fish, wildlife, and plants are
of ecological, educational, historical, recreational, esthetic, economic, and
scientific value to the people of this state, and the conservation, protection,
and enhancement of these species and their habitat is of statewide concern.  F&G Code §2051(c).  
            CESA
reflects the state’s policy “to conserve, protect, restore, and enhance any
endangered species or any threatened species and its habitat.”  F&G Code §2052.  An “endangered species” is a species or
subspecies that is in serious danger of becoming extinct through either all or
“a significant portion” of its range.  F&G
Code §2062.  A “threatened species” is a
native species or subspecies of bird, mammal, fish, amphibian, reptile, or
plant that, although not presently threatened with extinction, is likely to
become an endangered species in the foreseeable future in the absence of
required special protection and management efforts.  F&G Code §2067.  A “candidate species” is a native species or
subspecies of a bird, mammal, fish, amphibian, reptile, or plant which the
Commission has formally noticed as being under review by DFW for addition to
either the list of endangered species or the list of threatened species, or for
which the Commission has published a notice of proposed regulation to add to either
list.  F&G Code §2068.  
CESA shall be liberally
construed to allow the state agencies to properly carry out its conservation
duties.  Calif. Forestry Assn. v. Calif. Fish &
Game Comm’n, (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 1535, 1545. 
 
a. The First
Stage
CESA provides “interested person[s]” the right to petition
the Commission to list a species or subspecies as endangered.  F&G Code §§ 2070–2075.5.  A listing petition must include information
regarding the population trend, range, distribution, abundance, and life
history of a species, the habitat necessary for survival, the factors affecting
the ability of the population to survive and reproduce, the degree and
immediacy of the threat, the impact of existing management efforts, suggestions
for future management, the availability and sources of information, and a
detailed distribution map.  F&G Code §2072.3;
14 CCR §670.1(d).  This data, taken
together, must comprise “sufficient scientific information that [listing] may
be warranted.”  F&G Code §2072.3; 14
CCR §§ 670.1(b)-(d).
            Once
a listing petition is submitted, the Commission refers it to DFW.  F&G Code §2073.  Within the next 90 days, DFW must evaluate
the petition on its face and in relation to other relevant information it possesses
or receives.  F&G Code §2073.5(a).  DFW submits a written evaluation report
recommending that the Commission either reject or accept the petition based on
whether it has sufficient information to indicate that the petitioned action
may be warranted.  F&G Code §2073.5(a).  The Commission may grant a 30-day extension
upon DFW’s request.  F&G Code §2073.5(b).
            The
Commission then holds a public hearing at which any interested party may submit
additional evidence on the listing petition. 
F&G Code §§ 2074, 2074.2(a).  The
Commission uses DFW’s evaluation report to decide whether the petition provides
sufficient information to indicate that the petitioned action may be warranted.  F&G Code §2074.2(e).  If not, it shall publish a notice of finding
that the petition is rejected, including the reasons why the petition is not
sufficient.  F&G Code §2074.2(e)(1).
The standard for determining whether the petition provides
sufficient information that a species is a candidate for listing “requires only
that a substantial possibility of listing could be found by an objective,
reasonable person.”   Center for Biological Diversity v. Fish &
Game Com., (“CBD”) (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 597, 611.  A “substantial possibility” of listing “means
something more than the one-sided ‘reasonable possibility’ test for an
environmental impact report [under CEQA] but does not require that listing be
more likely than not.”  Id.
at 610 (citing Natural Resources Defense Council v. Fish
& Game Com., (“NRDC”) (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1104,
1125.  If a listing petition meets that
standard, the Commission must accept the petition for consideration.  CBD, supra,
166 Cal.App.4th at 599.  The
Commission abuses its discretion if it refuses to accept a listing petition
unless there is an “absence of any
substantial possibility that the species could be listed after the requisite
review of the status of the species by [DFW].” 
Id. at 611 (emphasis added).  If the balance is unclear, the court must
defer to the Commission.  Id.
If the petition is approved, the Commission’s notice must
list the petitioned species as a candidate species.  F&G Code §2074.2(e)(2).  Candidate species are entitled to the same
protections as listed species.  F&G
Code §2085.  Any “take” of the species is
prohibited unless authorized by a provision of CESA.  F&G Code §§ 2080,
2085.  “‘Take’ means hunt, pursue, catch,
capture, or kill, or attempt to hunt, pursue, catch, capture, or kill.”  F&G Code §86.  During the candidacy period, “the Commission
may authorize, subject to terms and conditions it prescribes, and based on the
best available scientific information … the taking of any candidate species …
provided that … the take is consistent with [CESA].”  F&G Code §2084(a).  DFW may also authorize entities to take
candidate species.  See, e.g., F&G
Code §2081.   
 
b. The Second Stage
DFW has 12 months to review the status of the candidate species
and produce and make publicly available on its website a final written peer
reviewed report, based upon the best scientific information available, which
indicates whether the petitioned action is warranted.  F&G Code §2074.6.  After DFW writes a draft report, it shall
have the draft prepared and independently peer reviewed, and upon receiving the
peer reviewers’ input, shall evaluate and respond in writing to the independent
peer review and shall amend the draft status review report as appropriate.  F&G Code §2074.6.  
The revised report shall be posted on DFW’s website for a
minimum of 30 days for public review.  F&G
Code §2074.6.  The Commission then holds
a hearing to decide whether the petitioned action is warranted or if listing
the petitioned species at a different status than requested by the petitioner
is warranted.  F&G Code §§ 2075.5(e)(1)-(2).
 
            2.
Emergency Regulations 
            A
state agency may adopt an emergency regulation pursuant to the Administrative Procedures
Act (“APA”) (Govt. Code section 11340 et. Seq).  At least five working days before submitting
an emergency regulation to the office, the adopting agency shall send notice of
the proposed emergency action to every person who has filed a request for
notice of regulatory action with the agency. 
Government Code (“Govt. Code”) §11346.1(a)(2).  The notice shall include the specific
language of the proposed regulation and the finding of an emergency.  Govt. Code §11346.1(a)(2).  An agency does not need to provide such
notice if the emergency clearly poses such an immediate, serious harm that
delaying action to allow public comment would be inconsistent with the public
interest.  Govt. Code §11346.1(a)(3).
            If
a state agency makes a finding that the adoption of a regulation or order of
repeal is necessary to address an emergency, the regulation or order of repeal
may be adopted as an emergency regulation or order of repeal.  Govt. Code §11346.1(b)(1).  Any finding of an emergency shall include a
written statement that contains the information required by Govt. Code section 11346.5(a)(2)-(6)
and a description of the specific facts demonstrating the existence of an
emergency and the need for immediate action. 
Govt. Code §11346.1(b)(2).  A
finding of emergency based only upon expediency, convenience, best interest,
general public need, or speculation shall not be adequate to demonstrate the
existence of an emergency.  Id.  If the situation identified in the finding of
emergency existed and was known by the agency adopting the emergency regulation
in sufficient time to have been addressed through non-emergency regulations,
the finding of emergency shall include facts explaining the failure to address
the situation through non-emergency regulations.  Id.
            The
emergency regulation or order of repeal shall become effective upon filing or
upon any later date specified by the state agency in a written instrument filed
with, or as a part of, the regulation or order of repeal.  Govt. Code §11346.1(d).  No emergency regulation shall remain in
effect more than 180 days unless the adopting agency has complied with Govt.
Code sections 11346.2 to 11347.3 and files certification of such with the
Secretary of State within that period.  Govt.
Code §11346.1(e).  Failure to comply with
Govt. Code section 11346.1(e) will constitute a repeal of the regulation and shall
be deleted after notice to the adopting agency by the office.  Govt. Code §11346.1(g).  
            Any
interested person may obtain a judicial declaration as to the validity of any
regulation or order of repeal by bringing an action for declaratory relief.  Govt. Code §11350(a).  The right to judicial determination shall not
be affected by the failure either to petition or to seek reconsideration of a
petition filed pursuant to Govt. Code section 11340.7 before the agency
promulgating the regulation or order of repeal. 
Id.  The regulation or
order of repeal may be declared to be invalid for a substantial failure to
comply with the APA.  Govt. Code
§11350(a).  When the regulation was an
emergency regulation or order of repeal, an attack on validity may be based
upon Govt. Code section 11346.1(b)’s requirement that the facts recited in the
finding of emergency constitute an emergency within the definition of that
provision.  Id.
            In
addition to any other ground that may exist, a regulation or order of repeal
may be declared invalid if the agency’s determination that the regulation is
reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute, court decision,
or other provision of law that is being implemented, interpreted, or made
specific by the regulation is not supported by substantial evidence.   Govt. Code §11350(b)(1).
 
            C.
Standard of Review
            1.
The Commission’s Decision
            There are three general categories
of agency decisions challenged by mandamus: (1) quasi-adjudicative decisions in
which the agency exercised its discretion, and which are challenged by
administrative mandamus under CCP section 1094.5, (2) quasi-legislative
decisions challenged by traditional mandamus under CCP section 1085, and (3)
ministerial or informal administrative actions also challenged by traditional
mandamus.  See Western States
Petroleum Assn. v. Superior Court, (1995) 9 Cal.4th 571-76.  
            The Commission decision to approve
the CalTrout petition is an administrative decision.  F&G Code §2076.  CCP section 1094.5
is the administrative mandamus provision which structures the procedure for
judicial review of adjudicatory decisions rendered by administrative
agencies.  Topanga Ass’n for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles, (“Topanga”)
(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 51415.  The pertinent issues under section 1094.5
are (1) whether the respondent has proceeded without jurisdiction, (2) whether
there was a fair trial, and (3) whether there was a prejudicial abuse of
discretion.  CCP §1094.5(b).  An abuse of discretion is established
if the respondent has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the decision
is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the
evidence.  CCP §1094.5(c). 
CCP section 1094.5 does not on its
face specify which cases are subject to independent review. Fukuda v. City
of Angels, (1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 811.  Instead, that issue
was left to the courts.  As stated ante, the Commission must decide
whether there is a “substantial possibility” of listing.  CBD, supra, 166 Cal.App.4th at 599.  The Commission abuses its discretion if it
refuses to accept a listing petition unless there is an “absence of any substantial possibility that
the species could be listed after the requisite review of the status of the species
by [DFW].”  Id. at 611 (emphasis added). 

Whether the Commission has met this standard is reviewed by
the court for substantial evidence.  CBD, supra, 166 Cal.App.4th at
609.  “Substantial evidence” is relevant
evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support
a conclusion (California Youth Authority v. State Personnel Board, (“California
Youth Authority”) (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 575, 585) or evidence
of ponderable legal significance, which is reasonable in nature, credible and
of solid value.  Mohilef v. Janovici, (1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 267, 305, n. 28. 
Substantial evidence can be the opinion of a single expert (Coastal
Southwest Dev. Corp. v. Coastal Zone Conservation Comm’n, (1976) 55
Cal.App.3d 525, 532), or opinions in a staff report (Griffin Dev. Co. v.
City of Oxnard, (1985) 39 Cal.3d 256, 261). 
            The court
considers all evidence in the administrative record, including evidence that
detracts from evidence supporting the agency’s decision.  California
Youth Authority, supra, 104 Cal.App.4th at 585.  The
court must uphold the decision unless it concludes, based on the evidence
before the City, a reasonable person could not reach the conclusion
reached by the administrative agency.¿¿Harris v. City of Costa Mesa,¿(1994)
25 Cal.App.4th 963, 969.  Where “reasonable persons may
differ,” the courts will not disturb the judgment of the administrative
agency.  Breakzone Billiards v. City of Torrance, (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th
1205, 1246.  The court does not weigh evidence or decide who has the
better argument and must resolve reasonable doubts in favor of the findings and
decision.  Topanga, supra, 11 Cal.3d at 514. 
            
2. The 2084 Exception
            The
Commission’s 2084 exception is a quasi-legislative decision subject to an abuse
of discretion standard.  An agency’s
quasi-legislative decision is an abuse of discretion only if it is “arbitrary,
capricious, entirely lacking in evidentiary support, unlawful, or procedurally
unfair.”  Kahn v. Los Angeles City
Employees’ Retirement System, (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 98, 106; Dominey v.
Dept. of Pers. Admin., (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 729, 736.   Although mandate will not lie to control the
agency’s discretion, it will lie to correct abuses of discretion.  California Public Records Research, Inc.
v. County of Alameda, (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 800, 806.  The court may not substitute its judgment for
that of the agency, and it must uphold the decision if reasonable minds can
differ.  Id. 
            An agency
is presumed to have regularly performed its official duties (Evid. Code §664),
and the petitioner seeking administrative mandamus or quasi-legislative
traditional mandamus therefore has the burden of proof.  Steele v. Los
Angeles County Civil Service Commission, (1958) 166 Cal.App.2d 129, 137; Afford
v. Pierno, (1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 682, 691 (“[T]he
burden of proof falls upon the party attacking the administrative decision to
demonstrate wherein the proceedings were unfair, in excess of jurisdiction or
showed prejudicial abuse of discretion).  
 
D. Statement of Facts
            1.
Background
            The
Vern Freeman Diversion Dam (“Freeman Dam”) is a concrete diversion dam spanning
the width of the Santa Clara River.  AR
157.  District operates the Freeman Dam to
conserve, maintain, and put to beneficial use the waters of the Santa Clara
River watershed, with one of the primary goals to combat seawater intrusion in
the Oxnard Plain.  AR 157.  District does so pursuant to Clean Water Act
Section 404 permit 86-116-TS and the Streambed Alteration Agreement No.
5-443-89, both issued in the late 1980s. 
AR 697-98, 785, 891.
            In
2016, the National Marine Fisheries Service (“NMFS”) released a five-year
review with a summary and evaluation of the O. mykiss distinct
population segment (“DPS”).  AR
5405.  It found that this DPS is endangered
and includes a suite of steelhead populations inhibiting coastal stream
networks from the Santa Maria River system south to the U.S.-Mexico border.  AR 5407. 
Freshwater resident O. mykiss (rainbow trout) occur in the same
geographic region, frequently in the same river systems as the anadromous
form.  AR 5407.  O. mykiss above and below impassable
dams within the Southern California DPS tended to be close relatives, suggesting
that each steelhead DPS is likely the anadromous component of a corresponding
Evolutionarily Significant Unit (“ESU”) with both anadromous and resident O.
mykiss.  AR 5407.
            The
NMFS study acknowledged key knowledge gaps about steelhead ecology.  AR 5426. 
These included uncertainty about the magnitude of normal fluctuations in
adult abundance and the underlying biological mechanisms for expression of
life-history diversity.  AR 5426.  Such mechanisms included the factors triggering
anadromous versus resident life-histories within populations.  AR 5426.
            In
the amended judgment for Wishtoyo Foundation et al. v. District Water
Conservation District (“Wishtoyo”) (2018), Case No. CV
16-3869-DOC.(PLAx), dated December 1, 2018, the federal district court found
that District’s maintenance of the Freeman Dam’s fish ladder constituted an
unauthorized taking of the steelhead DPS. 
AR 1253.  The court ordered
compliance with water diversion operating rules from Reasonable and
Prudent Alternative 2 of NMFS’s 2008
Biological Opinion for the Freeman Dam.  AR 1254. 
District was required to achieve 100% design, including physical
modeling, of fish passage infrastructure alternatives.  AR 1255. 
These included a hardened ramp and a 400-foot notch.  AR 1255. 
District was then required to select the preferred alternative and submit
complete regulatory authorization requests to NMFS, the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, DFW, and the California
State Water Resources Control Board.  AR
1255.  The judgment included a timeline
for compliance, with regulatory applications due by June 30, 2020.  AR 1256-58.
            A
winter 2020 study of O. mykiss found that its protection required a
suite of carefully planned and expeditiously implemented recovery actions.  SAR 6594. 
It also required recognition that protecting both resident and
anadromous O. mykiss will help recovery of the species as a whole.  SAR 6594.[2]
 
            2.
The CalTrout Petition
            On
June 11, 2021, CalTrout filed a petition asking the Commission to list
anadromous and resident O. mykiss as endangered under CESA.  AR 2, 7. 
The CalTrout petition cited over 100 scientific studies in support of
its argument.  AR 28-35.
 
            a.
Population Trends
            DFW
published a Steelhead Restoration and Management Plan in 1996, and the federal
government listed the O. mykiss ESU as an endangered species in 1997.  AR 8, 10. 
In 2006, the federal government modified the listing to include only the
anadromous component of the ESU.  AR
10.  
            Despite
continued efforts by various agencies and organizations since 1996, the steelhead
has seen little demonstrable improvement as of the CalTrout petition.  AR 8.  The
steelhead DPS’s annual run has decreased from between 32,000 and 46,000
returning adults to less than 500 per year. 
AR 9.  One compilation of O.
mykiss observation data from 1994 through 2018 documents only 177 observed
anadromous adult Southern steelhead within the past 25 years.  AR 10, 142.
            The
four watersheds historically exhibiting the largest annual anadromous runs are
the Santa Ynez River, Ventura River, Santa Clara River, and Malibu Creek.  AR 9.  All
four experienced 90% declines in run size. 
AR 9-10.  
            Extirpation
of the steelhead population would initiate a process of extinction of other O.
mykiss populations through loss of access to historical habitat to maintain
genetic diversity.  AR 9.  Fish passage barriers that completely block
access to freshwater spawning grounds also prevent genetic mixing on a regional
scale.  AR 9.  This reproductively isolates the few
remaining steelhead and freshwater resident native rainbow trout that
maintain anadromous genetic characteristics. 
AR 9.
 
            b.
Range
            The
NMFS identified the steelhead’s DPS as comprised of coastal watersheds from the
Santa Maria River system south to the U.S.-Mexico border, with O. mykiss
historically as far south as Rio del Presidio in Mexico.  AR 10. 

 
            c.
Distribution
            The
CalTrout petition included a distribution map showing the various
bio-geographic population groups in Southern California.  AR 12. 
In its explanation, the CalTrout petition reiterated that steelheads had
full anadromy and resident-freshwater forms. 
AR 13.  Habitat fragmentation from
anthropogenic barriers like dams has extirpated anadromous steelhead from
60% of its historical range.  AR 13.
            The
interplay of the life-history of steelhead and rainbow trout and historical
distribution is complex.  AR 13.  The freshwater resident form can give birth
to anadromous adults, likely based on epigenetic factors and environmental
influence.  AR 13.  This makes the freshwater resident form an
integral part of the population.  AR 13.  Environmental impacts from high intensity
wildfires, floods, and extended drought had further reduced the number of
small, isolated, remnant freshwater resident populations in the upper
tributaries.  AR 13.
            A
number of large, complex fish passage barriers remain in place or are not fully
functional.  AR 13.  A CESA listing would help such projects
progress so they can realize their potential in species recovery.  AR 13. 

 
            d.
Abundance
            Abundance
of steelhead varies greatly.  AR 13.  The nature of the river systems makes
monitoring and quantifying run sizes difficult. 
AR 13.  In the 1950s and 1960s,
the annual run of adult steelhead for any river was in the thousands or
tens of thousands.  AR 13-14.  Since its federal listing as endangered in
1997, annual runs of returning adults remain in the single digits for even the
most productive river systems.  AR 14.
            Rainbow
trout can express anadromy and reestablish a non-existent anadromous
population.  AR 14.  This means that resident freshwater
populations preserve the alleles needed for anadromy, and they could support
re-establishing viable anadromous populations. 
AR 14.  This also means that a
resident freshwater life-history strategy plays a central role to the continued
existence of the O. mykiss as a whole. 
AR 14.  Unless the loss of habitat
for anadromous O. mykiss is reversed, there will be a greater need for resident
freshwater rainbow trout to produce smolts that express anadromy and enter the
Pacific Ocean.  AR 14.
            Freshwater
resident populations also are at risk. 
AR 14.  Watershed-scale adverse
anthropogenic impacts, quickening climate stress and other population level
threats place freshwater resident populations at risk.  AR 14. 
Catastrophic wildland fires, long term drought, and continued human
alteration of headwater habitat add additional pressure.  AR 14.
 
            e.
Life History
            The
life cycle of steelhead generally includes a freshwater period in coastal river
systems followed by a migration to a marine environment to reach sexual
maturity.  AR 15.  Most steelhead spend one to three years in freshwater
coastal river systems before migrating to a marine environment.  AR 15-16. 
They then spend one to four years maturing in the Pacific Ocean, during
which time anadromous adults grow larger than freshwater residents.  AR 15. 
After reaching maturity, most steelheads return to their natal river
system to spawn.  AR 15.  Some stray to other river systems and
therefore increase genetic variability and connection across basins.  AR 16. 

In contrast, the freshwater O. mykiss, or rainbow
trout, will incubate, hatch, rear, mature, reproduce, and die in freshwater.  AR 16. 
Embryo incubation times vary between three weeks and two months.  AR 15.
            
            f.
Necessary Habitat
            O.
mykiss need a variety of habitats to exploit at different stages of their
life cycles.  AR 16-17.  Steelhead need cool, clean water and a complex,
connected habitat.  AR 17.
 
            g.
Factors Affecting Ability to Survive and Reproduce
            Destruction,
modification, and fragmentation of native habitat are recognized as the primary
causes for the decline of the steelhead. 
AR 18.  The development of water
infrastructure, agriculture, urbanization, and catastrophic wildland fire and
drought have contributed to this fragmentation. 
AR 18.
 
            h.
Degree of Immediacy of Threat
            Recent
assessments of steelhead populations predict their extinction within 25-50
years due to the degradation of habitat from human development and climate
crisis.  AR 19.
 
            i.
Impact of Existing Management Efforts
            The
federal government listed the steelhead as an endangered species in 1997 and
increased this geographical range of this protection in 2002.  AR 20. 
Four U.S. national forests within the DPS have land management practices
requiring protection and conservation decisions to account for listed
species.  AR 20.  Despite federal intervention, population
levels have not experienced a discernable change since 1997.   AR 20. 

            Many
steelhead migration barriers have been remediated, but others remain in place.  AR 20. 
Significant investment over the years has supported advanced engineering
design for remediation of these barriers, but implementation remains
problematic.  AR 20.  Until the species is listed under CESA, NMFS
is the only government agency with direct oversight over the condition of the
species and its required habitat in most cases. 
AR 20.  
 
            j.
Suggestions for Future Management
            The
CalTrout petition recommended listing O. mykiss as endangered under CESA
while accepting the current limits of anadromy as established by the ESA
listing for the species.  AR 22.  When the Commission lists the steelhead as
endangered, DFW will have authority to oversee projects proposed within the
current limits of anadromy.  AR 22.  CalTrout supports following the federal
listing for below barrier steelhead while keeping the above barrier rainbow
trout outside ESA coverage.  AR 23.  Steelhead are part of a precariously small
population in a discontinuous spatial context trending towards extinction.  AR 23. 
Rainbow trout are geographically dispersed but genetically demonstrable
remnant populations of steelhead.  AR
23.  
            Aside
from listing O. mykiss as an endangered species, recommended measures
include allowing only catch-and-release fishing and barbless lures.  AR 24. 
The CalTrout petition also proposed signs and fishing survey boxes at key
access points to explain the role of native rainbow trout in steelhead recovery.  AR 24. 
DFW should stock streams with only non-reproducing rainbow trout, and
barriers should prevent the escape of hatchery trout into high-priority
recovery rivers.  AR 24.
 
            3.
Referral to DFW
            On
June
23, 2021, the Commission referred the CalTrout petition to DFW for evaluation.  AR 36.  The
Commission published notice of this referral in the California Regulatory
Notice Register on July 16, 2021.  AR
44.  It also gave notice that it would
formally receive the CalTrout petition at its August 18-19, 2021 meeting.  AR 60. 
The public could submit any information to DFW.  AR 61.
            On August
18, 2021, the Commission publicly received the CalTrout petition and approved
DFW’s request for a 30-day extension to prepare its report.  AR 1444.
            
            4.
District’s Submission
            On
August 17, 2021, District submitted information opposing the CalTrout petition.  AR 235. 
District objected to the assertion that the Freeman Dam had not been
remediated.  AR 157.  It already provides passage of anadromous
steelhead, with two confirmed upstream migrations observed in 2020.  AR 157. 
District also continues to prepare a Habitat Conservation Plan per the
federal ESA to rehabilitate the dam’s fish passage facility.  AR 157. 
Meanwhile, the District States Bureau of Reclamation was physically
modeling alternative fish passage designs. 
AR 157.  District continuously
consults with NMFS and DFW on all these measures.  AR 157.
            District
asserted that the CalTrout petition and NMFS both acknowledge the interplay
between steelhead O. mykiss and freshwater resident trout.  AR 240-41. 
The CalTrout petition states that fish expressing the resident life-history
strategy are central to the continued existence of southern steelhead.  AR 240. 
A 2020 study emphasized the importance of protecting existing
populations and all life history expressions.  AR 241. 
The limited consideration of purely anadromous fish for the recovery
goal was biologically inappropriate.  AR 242.
            CalTrout
calculated the number of necessary anadromous spawners per year as
4,150 based on a study that relied solely on anadromous spawners.  AR 241. 
This excluded the contribution of resident trout to recovery goals for
the resident
trout.  AR 241.  
            NMFS’s
2016 study made the same assumptions but as a risk-adverse strategy.  AR 241. 
It stated that further scientific work would fill key knowledge gaps
about the magnitude of normal fluctuations in adult abundance and the
underlying biological mechanisms for expression of life-history diversity.  AR 242. 
These findings and research questions need to be closely considered by
DFW.  AR 242.
            A
2020 study found that resident and anadromous O. mykiss are tightly
integrated at the population level.  AR
242.  This supported revising the
viability criterion requiring 100% anadromous spawners in smolt
production.  AR 242.
            Various
surveys between the 1990s and 2005 observed high levels of O. mykiss per
100 feet but relatively few smolts migrating out to the ocean.  AR 243. 
This suggests that rivers like the Santa Clara River have a naturally
low fraction of anadromy, which is common when the cost to migrate to and from
the ocean is high.  AR 243.  
            One
2015 paper reviewed various studies documenting the factors that may influence
the fraction of anadromy, one of which was migration cost.  AR 244. 
For example, seasonally dry stream reaches and lagoon sandbar formations
can limit migration opportunities.  AR
244.  Historic planting of steelhead O.
mykiss may have inflated anadromy for a period.  AR 244. 
District recommended more studies on the relationship between anadromous
production and environmental factors before any CESA listing.  AR 244. 
The resident contribution should cause the viability of the species as a
whole to rise.  AR 244.
            In
a 2008 study, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (“NOAA”)
Southwest Fisheries Science Center failed to find any genetic basis for
dividing the population of the Southern California steelhead and the South-Central
Coast steelhead into distinct biological groups.  AR 245.  This study used nuclear DNA, a superior
approach to those in other studies like allozyme analysis and chromosome
sampling.  AR 245.
            CESA
provides for listing a species or subspecies as endangered, not a DPS.  AR 245. 
CalTrout recommends listing only anadromous steelhead O. mykiss
as endangered, but it does not identify it as a subspecies separate from rainbow
trout.  AR 245.  DFW has previously recommended not listing
certain Northern California summer steelhead ecotypes as endangered because it
was not its own subspecies.  AR 245.  The same conclusion should apply here.  AR 245.
 
            5.
DFW’s Recommendation
            In
November 2021, DFW released its evaluation of the CalTrout petition.   AR 132. 
The proposed action would list the steelhead as endangered under
CESA.  AR 133.  
On October 4, 2021, DFW asked CalTrout to clarify the
definition of “Southern California steelhead” for its petition.  AR 138. 
CalTrout replied that the petition included all O. mykiss,
including anadromous and resident life histories, below manmade and natural
complete barriers to anadromy from the Santa Maria River in San Luis Obispo
County to the U.S./Mexico border.  AR 133,
138.  The petition excluded any
above-barrier resident O. mykiss. 
AR 149.  DFW then reviewed letters
and scientific information from various sources, some attached to the report
and some posted online.  AR 138-39.
            DFW
concluded that the CalTrout petition presented sufficient scientific
information to indicate that listing steelhead as endangered under CESA may be
warranted.  AR 133-35.  The Commission should therefore accept and
consider it.  AR 135.
 
            a.
O. mykiss Overview
            Although
the O. mykiss has a resident and an anadromous phenotype, the two are sympatric.  AR 139. 
They interbreed through much of the habitat range, and offspring can express
either life history depending on genotype, individual condition, and
environmental factors.  AR 139.   Juveniles from each group are difficult to
distinguish without genetic, morphological, or physiological evaluations.  AR 139-40. 

            Even
their early life stages are identical until anadromous O. mykiss migrate
to the ocean.  AR 140.  After they hatch as fry, they spend a few
months developing into parr in shallow water. 
AR 140.  After growing for another
1-4 years, the parr begin transitioning into smolts.  AR 140. 
They migrate downstream to estuaries and lagoons where they complete
smolting, which are a series of morphological and physiological changes
preparing them for a marine environment. 
AR 140.  These anadromous smolt
then migrate to the ocean when ideal based on connectivity between the ocean
and the estuary or lagoon at issue.  AR
140.  Adult steelhead returning from the
ocean are easier to identify because they are larger and have an overall steel
grey color.  AR 140.
 
            b.
Sufficiency of the Petition’s Evidence 
            DFW
found that CalTrout provided sufficient scientific information on all required
categories, including future management suggestions, to demonstrate that the
proposed listing may be warranted.  AR
141, 149-50.  The CalTrout petition cited
relevant studies for most points, and those studies also supported some uncited
statements.  AR 141.  DFW assumed that the remaining unsupported statements
were accurate but acknowledged that it would need to further verify them if the
Commission accepted the CalTrout petition for further consideration.  AR 141. 

            Because
most of CalTrout’s data on population abundance and trends concerned the
anadromous O. mykiss, DFW relied on internal data on resident O.
mykiss observations in various southern California streams.  AR 142. 
DFW and the Santa Monica Mountains Resource Conservation District collected
this data from 2004 to 2021.  AR 142.  DFW acknowledged that such observations do
not equate to total estimates of population abundance in those streams.  AR 142-43. 
Nevertheless, the available data did show a downward O. mykiss population
trend.  AR  142. 
Only eight of the 52 priority recovery watersheds listed in the species’
NMFS recovery plan contained a remnant population, and most of those are above
total barriers.  AR 142.
            As
to abundance, the CalTrout petition emphasizes that resident O. mykiss
are important contributors to anadromous O. mykiss populations.  AR 144. 
Recent studies showed that resident O. mykiss have the alleles
associated with anadromy.   AR 144.  This suggests they have the potential to contribute
to anadromous populations.  AR 144.  However, the shrinking population of resident
O. mykiss can lead to loss of genetic diversity, including genes for anadromous
populations.  AR 144.  
            As
to factors affecting the ability to survive and reproduce, large dams and other
complete migration barriers block Ventura River, Santa Clara River, Santa Ynez
River, and Malibu Creek.  AR 147.  These obstructions block access to upstream
habitats and impede smolt migration to the ocean.  AR 147. 

            As
to the immediacy of the threat, the CalTrout petition had sufficient scientific
information to show that the various present threats leave the Southern
California steelhead in immediate danger of extirpation.  AR 148. 
As to the impact of existing measures, federal protections have not led
to positive change in population abundance since the 1997 listing under the
federal ESA.  AR 148.
            As
to future management, the proposed CESA listing would include all O. mykiss
below man-made barriers but exclude any above-barrier resident O. mykiss.  AR 149. 
This would allow any above-barrier rainbow trout fishing to continue,
but it also would allow emergency translocation of trout to either develop
broodstock or enhance genetic and geographic diversity.  AR 149.
 
            6.
The December 2021 Commission Meeting
            At
its December 15, 2021 meeting, the Commission considered the DFW’s report and heard
oral comments from the public.  AR 333.  The Commission voted to schedule a more
comprehensive debate on the CalTrout petition in February 2022.  AR 359, 362.
            
            7.
The Orange County Water District’s Comment
            On
February 3, 2022, the Orange County Water District (“OCWD”) submitted a letter
in opposition to the CalTrout petition. 
AR 508.  OCWD asserted that the
inclusion of resident trout below barriers in the request to list the species
as endangered was a significant deviation. 
AR 509.  It created a deficiency
in the CalTrout petition, which did not have any information relevant to the rainbow
trout.  AR 509.  This inherently meant the provided
information was insufficient to justify listing the species on the CESA
endangered list as defined.  AR 509.
            The
Commission needs to consider and evaluate all readily available information
about the combined population dynamics and demographics of both types of O.
mykiss.  AR 509.  Readily available data and literature show
that resident trout are more abundant and in more viable populations than
anadromous O. mykiss.  AR 509, 511,
517-18.  Its population has also trended
upward in favorable years.  AR 511,
517-18.  The rainbow trout also
contribute substantially to the persistence of the overall species.  AR 509. 
The combined life history supports a determination that listing is not
warranted.  AR 509.
 
            8.
The February 2022 Commission Meeting
            At
its February 17, 2022 meeting, the Commission discussed whether to designate
the steelhead as a candidate species.  AR
1281.
            CalTrout
delivered a presentation in support of its petition.  AR 612. 
CalTrout asserted that residential and anadromous O. mykiss are
two distinct life histories.  AR
1283.  While the range at issue had a
healthy population of residential trout, the fraction of O. mykiss
expressing anadromy had been pushed to the brink of extinction.  AR 1303.
A scientist with DFW’s Anadromous Fishes Conservation and
Management Program presented its conclusions. 
AR 1282.  Although resident trout
help maintain the anadromous population to some extent, DFW had not determined
abundance and trends for resident fish because of the limited data
available.  AR 1292.  Overall, the steelhead’s population status
had not improved since the Southern California steelhead was federally listed in
1997.  AR 1292.
            District
noted that CalTrout had agreed via settlement agreement that the Freeman Dam
adequately protected the steelhead.  AR
1332-33.  The CalTrout petition does not
mention this or ask for an exception for the Freeman Dam.  AR 1333. 
If the Commission took any action that might change the guidelines in
the settlement agreement, a federal court would prohibit that as state
interference with a federal injunction.  
AR 1333.  District implored the
Commission to analyze other contributors to the population’s decline more
thoroughly.  AR 1334.
            At
the end of the meeting, the Commission voted to continue deliberation by up to
60 days, until its next meeting in April 2022. 
AR 1387-88.  It directed staff to
work with DFW, interested parties, and local tribes to explore a possible 2084
Exception.  AR 1387.
 
            9.
The Proposed 2084 Exception
            District
submitted a proposed 2084 exception for the Santa Felicia and Freeman Dams,
their ongoing operations, and improvements thereto.  AR 1586. 
These projects provide a sustainable, clean and reliable water supply
for over 400,000 people within a nearly 213,000-acre region.  AR 1587. 
The proposed regulation would exempt projects or activities if the
proponent shows the project (1) relates to flood control, (2) provides one of a
defined set of services necessary to either protect public peace, health,
safety, or general welfare or conserve, preserve, or protect species, and (3)
either is not required to have take authorization from NMFS or has such
authorization under the federal ESA.  AR
1589.  The project proponent must also be
legally mandated to perform the activity. 
AR 1589.
 
            10.
The April 2022 Commission Meeting
            At
its April 21, 2022 meeting, the Commission voted to find that the CalTrout petition
provided sufficient information to indicate the proposed action may be
warranted.  AR 1626-27.  
The Commission then discussed staff’s proposed 2084 exception
for conditional take of the candidate species. 
AR 1628.  The proposed exception
had three requirements.  AR 1631.  First, any project must be a highway project
or a flood control or other water project that would meet the APA’s definition
of an emergency if operations were to stop or be delayed.  AR 1631. 
Second, the project proponent would need to provide documentation of
federal take coverage through a biological opinion or an incidental take permit
from NMFS.  AR 1631.  Third, the project would need to demonstrate
compliance with F&G Code section 1602. 
AR 1631.  
            Staff
acknowledged that the proposed regulation would not cover all agencies and all
circumstances as there are unique circumstances that require more specific
consideration.  AR 1631.  For such projects, CESA authorizes a take
through other means like a DFW-issued permit under F&G Code section
2081.  AR 1631-32.  DFW’s director invited such project
proponents to call DFW for individual permitting or to assess the project’s
risk profile.  AR 1637.
            District
noted that CalTrout had recognized the abundance of residential trout in
watersheds like the Sespe Creek and Santa Paula Creek.  AR 1652-53. 
CalTrout also had acknowledged that if both O. mykiss populations
were counted together, the abundance in those watersheds would not merit CESA
protections.  AR 1653.
            DFW’s
director noted that DFW only had 60 days since the last Commission meeting to
create a 2084 Exception.  AR 1690.  It therefore did not have time to consider
every affected project with a possible relationship to the fish at issue.  AR 1690.
            The
Commission voted to find it necessary to address an emergency situation under
Govt. Code section 11346.1 and approve a modified regulation.  AR 1700-02.
 
            11.
Findings
            On
May 11, 2022, the Commission issued written notice of its findings on the
CalTrout petition.  AR 1835.  The Commission found that the information in
the CalTrout petition, when considered in light of DFW’s evaluation report and
comments received, would lead a reasonable person to conclude there is a
substantial possibility the requested listing could occur.  AR 1835. 
As a result, the Commission provided notice that the O. mykiss is
a candidate species under F&G Code section 2068.  AR 1835. 
DFW was directed to prepare a written report within one year of
publication of the findings.  AR
1835.  
The notice was published in the California Notice Register on
May 13, 2022.  AR 1836, 1846-56.
            On
May 16, 2022, the Office of Administrative Law approved the 2084 Exception as an
emergency regulatory action.  See 14
CCR §749.13.  AR 1831-32.  The regulation authorizes taking of the
candidate species if the project (1) relates to flood control, a highway, or diversion,
impoundment, or discharge of water, (2) provides flood protection, water supply
or treatment, and highway maintenance necessary to protect public peace,
health, or safety, and (3) has valid take authorization from NMFS through a
federal incidental take statement or incidental take permit under the federal ESA.  AR 1833 (14 CCR §§ 749.13(a)(1)-(3)).  
            If
DFW decides to issue take authorization, the proponent shall undertake the
project or activity as described in the project or activity’s federal
incidental take statement or incidental take permit.  AR 1834 (14 CCR §749.13(c)).  The state take authorization shall be for the
same type and amount as the federal take authorization.  AR 1834 (14 CCR §749.13(c)).  The proponent loses take authorization if the
federal authorization is amended or revoked. 
AR 1834 (14 CCR §749.13(d)).
 
            E.
Analysis[3]
            Petitioner
District raises two main issues: (1) the Commission abused its discretion in finding
that listing SCS as endangered may be warranted; and (2) the Commission
refused to consider all relevant factors when adopting the 2084 exception.
 
1. The Commission Was Not Required to Find That
Substantial Evidence Supports Each of the 12 Factors in F&G Code Section 2072.3
 The Commission uses
DFW’s evaluation report to decide whether a petition provides sufficient
information to indicate that the petitioned action may be warranted.  F&G Code §2074.2(e).  The standard for determining whether the
petition provides sufficient information that a species is a candidate for
listing “requires only that a substantial possibility of listing could be found
by an objective, reasonable person.”   CBD, supra,
66 Cal.App.4th at 611.  A
“substantial possibility” of listing “means something more than the one-sided
‘reasonable possibility’ test for an environmental impact report [under CEQA]
but does not require that listing be more likely than not.”  Id.
at 610.  If a listing petition meets that
standard, the Commission must accept the petition for consideration.  Id.
at 599.  The Commission abuses its
discretion if it refuses to accept a listing petition unless there is an
“absence of any
substantial possibility that the species could be listed after the requisite
review of the status of the species by [DFW].” 
Id. at 611
(emphasis added).  If the balance is
unclear, the court must defer to the Commission.  Id.
District notes that CalTrout’s petition must comply with the
strict process required by both CESA and
Commission regulations and argues that the petition must include “sufficient
scientific information” for each of 12 factors.[4]  As the California Supreme Court stated,
F&G Code section 2072.3 “sets forth
the requirements a petition must satisfy for acceptance.” 
Cent. Coast Forest Ass’n v. Cal. Fish &
Game Comm’n, (2017) 2 Cal. 5th 594, 604-05 (“At a minimum…the
petition shall include sufficient scientific information that a petitioned
action may be warranted.  The section
then lists specific information the petition “shall include”.…).  CESA
requires sufficient scientific information in each of the 12 factors for a
crucial reason: without information in each of those data, there is no way to
bridge the gap between the raw evidence and the ultimate decision or order.  See Topanga, supra, 11
Cal. 3d at 515.  The Commission’s
regulations also require that it reject a listing petition that fails to include
sufficient scientific information for each of the 12 factors.  14 CCR
§670.1(b), (e)(1).  Pet. Op. Br. at
10-11.
Based on this authority, District argues that the
Commission’s decision finding that listing SCS as endangered may be warranted
is unlawful because it did not receive substantial evidence on each required
element.  A species does not qualify for
candidate status if there is not sufficient information that would lead a
reasonable person to conclude that the petitioned action may be warranted.  NRDC, supra, 28 Cal. App. 4th at 1119.  As expressly admitted in DFW’s evaluation
report, each of the CalTrout petition’s 12 factors had little to no information
about rainbow trout.  In fact, the
petition presented no evidence at all for the population and abundance of
rainbow trout.  Where a statute requires
an agency to consider certain elements, its failure to do so constitutes a lack
of substantial evidence.  Topanga, supra, 11 Cal. 3d
at 515
(zoning ordinance required comparative analysis and failure to include that
analysis constituted lack of substantial evidence); Cal Ass’n Health Services v. DHS,
(2012) 204 Cal. App. 4th 676, 688-89 (DHS decision for reimbursement lacked
substantial evidence where it was based on studies done in another state which
may or may not be relevant given differences in cost of living and population
size).  This disconnect between the
evidence presented (almost entirely on steelhead) and the decision (which
purport to cover both anadromous and resident life forms) is a clear violation
of the Topanga rule.    Pet. Op. Br. at 11-12.
District adds that the DWF evaluation report’s reference to its
internal data does not save the Commission’s decision because the evaluation report
expressly admits: “though the Department has internal data on resident O. mykiss observation in various
southern Californian streams . . . these O.
mykiss observations do not equate to total estimates of population
abundance in streams for which they are available.”  AR 142-43. 
Accordingly, DFW’s internal data provides no estimate of rainbow trout population
abundance which CESA expressly requires.  District concludes that, because the
Commission failed to analyze the status of O. mykiss under each of the
required 12 data sets, it failed to proceed in the manner required by law,
thereby prejudicially abusing its discretion.  CCP
§1094.5(b).  Pet.
Op. Br. at 12.
District is mixing
concepts.  Topanga is not a
substantial evidence case.  Rather, Topanga
held that CCP section 1094.5 implicitly requires the administrative agency to
set forth findings that bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence and
the decision.  11 Cal.3d at 515.  An agency’s failure to perform this task is
not a failure of evidence, it is a failure to proceed in the manner required by
law.  The Commission points out that it
has no duty to make any finding other than the statutory requirement that there
is sufficient information to indicate that listing SCS may be warranted.  Comm. Opp. at 14-15.  In reply, District clarifies its position to
argue that there is insufficient evidence to support each of the 12 factors.  Reply at 6. 
While it continues to argue an analytic gap, District abandons any Topanga
issue that the Commission was obligated to make findings on each of the 12
factors.  The court views District’s
argument fundamentally as the contention that the Commission lacked substantial
evidence to make its decision.
Intervenors are correct
(Int. Opp. at 7-8) that District misreads CESA’s
requirements for listing petitions.  The
statute provides that a listing petition “shall, at a minimum, include sufficient
scientific information that a petitioned action may be warranted.”  F&G Code §2072.3.
 The petition must include “information
regarding the population trend, range, distribution, abundance,” and
other factors, but there is no requirement that the petition include
“sufficient scientific information” for each of the 12 factors listed.  Therefore, District’s
argument fails. 
If the meaning of
F&G Code section 2072.3 is not plain, Intervenors point out (Int. Opp. at
8) that a “basic tenet” of statutory construction is that “a court cannot add
or subtract words to or from the statute.”  Scottsdale
Indemnity Co. v. National Continental Ins. Co., (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th
1166, 1172.  In suggesting that F&G
Code section 2072.3 requires the petition to include sufficient scientific
information for each of the 12 factors, District is asking the court to delete the
bolded, bracketed language from F&G Code section
2072.3: “To be accepted, a petition shall, at a minimum, include sufficient
scientific information [that a petitioned action may be warranted. Petitions
shall include information] regarding the population trend, range,
distribution, abundance….”  
CESA mandates that the Commission accept a listing
petition, despite limited or no information in one or more categories, when
other information in the record suffices to meet CESA’s threshold for candidacy.  CBD,
supra, 166 Cal.App.4th at 612 (the listing petition must
be accepted whenever “an objective, reasonable person clearly would conclude
there is a substantial possibility that listing could occur.”).  No authority supports District’s contention
that the Commission must reject a listing petition that lacks sufficient
scientific information for one or more of the 12 factors.  
District replies
that the CESA regulations make crystal clear that sufficient scientific information
for each of the 12 factors is required.  14
CCR section 670.1(b) states: “A petition
shall be deemed incomplete if it is not submitted on FGC-670.1 (3/94) or
fails to contain information in each of the required categories set
forth in subsection (d)(1).” (emphasis
added).  Similarly,
24 CCR section 670.1 (e)(1) expressly states that a petition “will be
rejected by the Commission if it fails to include sufficient scientific
information under the categories of [F&G Code section 2072.3(d)(1)(A)-(L)].”  Reply at 6-7.
This argument does
not aid District.  Neither of 14 CCR
section 670.1(b) and (e)(1) sets forth a requirement for the Commission’s
evaluation of a petition.  The regulation
only concerns the information which a petition must include and only states
that the petition must provide scientific information in each of the 12 categories
and that the scientific information provided must be sufficient.  This does not mean that the information must
be sufficient in each category.  CESA
requires only that the petition include sufficient scientific information that
a petitioned action may be warranted. 
F&G Code §2072.3.  The listing
petition must include information regarding the 12 factors.  F&G Code §2072.3; 14 CCR §670.1(d).  Nothing in F&G Code section 2072.3
requires the petition to include sufficient scientific information for each of
the 12 factors; it only requires sufficient scientific information that the
petitioned action may be warranted.  This
is a collective evaluation, not a category-by-category one.
District’s position
to the contrary is directly at odds with CBD.   In
that case, the court found that the Commission erred in rejecting a petition to
add the California tiger salamander to the list of endangered species.  166 Cal.App.4th at 599.  The Commission found the petition lacked
sufficient information for several of the 12 categories of information
required, including population trends, abundance, range, degree and immediacy
of threat, and impacts of existing management. 
Id. at 606-07.  The Commission concluded that “[a]bsent an
accurate assessment of the history or current population of a species, any
determination of threat to the species would be speculation.” Id. at 606.
The CBD court
held that the issue is not whether there are deficiencies in the listing
petition’s showing on any subordinate issue, but “rather whether they warrant
the ultimate, statutory finding required to reject the petition.”  Id. at 609.  The “Commission is
not free to choose between conflicting inferences on subordinate issues and
thereafter rely upon those choices in assessing how a reasonable person would
view the listing decision.  Its decision
turns not on rationally based doubt about listing, but on the absence of any
substantial possibility that the species could be listed.…”  Id. at 611.  The Commission also is required to draw
available inferences from the information in support of listing the
species.  Id. at 612.  
The evidence showed
that the salamander does not breed prolifically, is vulnerable to several
significant threats, has lost most of its original habitat, and has been
displaced by a hybrid competitor from most of its range.  Id. at 599.  The “absence of …population counts does not
greatly diminish the strength of the inferences of threat or endangerment that
arise from the showing of habitat loss.”  Id. at 612.  The court relied almost exclusively on just
two categories of information: loss of habitat and hybridization that
“independently affords a strong inference of threat or endangerment” due to
competition with another species.  Id.
at 611-12. Based on this information, a “reasonable person clearly would
conclude there is a substantial possibility that listing could occur,” and this
was all that was required at this first stage of the CESA process.  Id. at 612.[5]
District distinguishes
CBD, arguing that the court excused the lack of information on total
population based primarily on the difficulty of distinguishing between the
native species sought to be protected and the hybrid/non-native species that
were not a part of the petition.  Id. at 602-03.  Reply at 7-8. 
Whatever the reason, CBD clearly did not require that there be
sufficient scientific information for each of 12 factors in F&G Code
section 2072.3.[6]
 
2. The
Commission’s Finding Is Supported By Substantial Evidence
District contends
the Commission lacked sufficient information about rainbow trout to support the
decision that listing may be warranted.  Pet.  Op. Br. at 11.  
As both the
Commission and Intervenors argue (Comm. Opp. at 15; Int. Opp. at 10), CalTrout asked
that SCS -- which includes both anadromous and resident life histories below
barriers to anadromy -- be considered for listing. “[T]he CESA
listing include all O. mykiss, including both anadromous and resident life
histories, below manmade and natural fish passage barriers, while excluding
above-barrier resident O. mykiss.” AR 149.    Thus,
the issue is whether the Commission had substantial evidence that there is a
substantial possibility of listing SCS as endangered after DFW’s second stage
review.  See CBD, supra, 66
Cal.App.4th at 611.  In determining this
issue, the Commission was entitled to look at the 12 categories in F&G Code
section 2072.3 collectively.
DFW evaluated
the information regarding SCS, and the Commission concluded that sufficient
scientific information supported a determination that listing SCS as endangered
may be warranted.  According to
Intervenors, the CalTrout petition paints a sobering picture of threats arising
from dams, human development, wildfires, climate change, and habitat loss, the
combination of which will likely result in SCS’s extirpation from Southern
California.  AR 1.  The
current threat to steelhead is so extreme and immediate that this population is
in danger of extinction within the next 25-50 years.  AR 19.  Existing management efforts have failed, with
federal protection of federally listed steelhead in anadromous waters not
leading to any “discernable change in total population size[.]” AR 20, 148-49.  Int. Opp. at 10. 
Intervenors contend
that the CalTrout petition and DFW evaluation
included “information regarding” population trend and abundance.  The petition
presented information regarding the dramatic decline of steelhead, from 20,000
to 30,000 steelhead in the 1970s to 1000 adults in 2012.  AR 13.  More recently, steelhead have experienced
“declines in run size of greater than 90 percent.”  AR
10. Int. Opp. at 12.
The CalTrout petition
noted that the interplay of the two life histories is critical to support
current and future abundance for SCS.  AR 12.  The petition further explained that freshwater
resident populations too have seen a downward trend since they also “are at
risk from watershed-scale adverse anthropogenic impacts”.  AR 14.  Recent studies on the population of O.
mykiss on the Pacific coast indicate that the population of anadromous
remain endangered and resident forms that co-exist within watersheds are
similarly declining.  AR 10. 
Int. Opp. at 12-13.
DFW’s evaluation report similarly observed that
“while abundance estimates are not available for all populations of [SCS],
available presence/absence data shows a downward trend.” AR 142. 
DFW noted that multiple populations have been extirpated and the largest
historical populations in the Santa Ynez River, Ventura River, Santa Clara
River, and Malibu Creek watersheds all have declined over 90%.  AR 10.  Data show only 177 observed steelhead within
the past 25 years.  AR 10. 
Int. Opp. at 13.
DFW also considered
its “internal data on resident O. mykiss observations” below barriers.  AR
141-42.  While DFW admitted that “these O. Mykiss
observations do not equate to total estimates of population abundance”, DFW explained that data is
not available because juvenile O. mykiss are “difficult to distinguish
without genetic, morphological, or physiological evaluations.”  AR 139-40.
 According to Intervenors, this
discussion satisfies CESA’s requirement
that the petition provide information regarding population and abundance.[7]  Int. Opp. at 13.
District correctly
replies that the population numbers cited in CalTrout’s petition relate solely
to anadromous populations and there is no information related to population
trend and abundance for resident O. mykiss.  At most, Intervenors cite evidence that resident
populations are at risk from standard, universal factors affecting most
species: “wildland fires, long-term drought, and climate stress.”  Universal risks that
are presented to most species cannot substitute for the required information on
population trend and abundance of resident O. mykiss.  These risks also must be slight because,
as CalTrout admitted, there is a healthy population of resident O. mykiss.  AR
1303.  Additionally, DFW’s internal data
on resident O. mykiss do not meet the statutory requirement for
information on population abundance by DFW’s admission.  AR
142-43.  Reply at 9.
Although the
CalTrout petition and DFW evaluation report lack evidence on rainbow trout, the
Commission correctly notes that both documents discussed the interconnection
between the two life histories, and DFW’s report discusses the fact that “the
two forms are sympatric, i.e., they can interbreed, throughout much of their
range, and offspring can express either life history.  The expression of anadromy or residency is
subject to a fish’s genotype, individual condition, and environmental factors.”  AR 139
(citations omitted).  “Juvenile steelhead
and Rainbow Trout are difficult to distinguish without genetic, morphological
or physiological evaluations.”  AR 139-40 (citations omitted).  Comm. Opp. at 15-16.
The CalTrout petition
explained the central role that resident O. mykiss play in the continued
existence of steelhead.  Resident and
anadromous O. mykiss forms are sympatric, i.e., they can interbreed, and
the offspring of the resident form can express anadromous life history. See AR 132-39.  The plasticity between the two life histories,
and their close integration, indicate that harm to resident O. mykiss
decreases the population of fish capable of anadromy or anadromous offspring.  SAR 5405 (juvenile
resident and anadromous O. mykiss overlap in population, so viability
and preservation considerations for anadromous fish necessitates including the
resident form).  As steelhead continue to
decline in population, “there will be a greater need for resident freshwater
rainbow trout to produce the vast majority of smolts that express
anadromy.”  AR 14.  Int. Opp. at 10-11.
The CalTrout petition
emphasized that the resident form is critical not only to maintaining steelhead
numbers, but also to preserving the genetic material associated with
anadromy.  AR 14, AR
144.  Resident O. mykiss contain
the genetic material to pass along anadromy to their offspring.  AR 1292.  DFW’s evaluation notes that “resident O. mykiss are important contributors to
[SCS] populations.”  AR 144. 
Recent genetic studies indicate that resident O. mykiss “have the potential to express anadromy and contribute to
anadromous populations” and that “shrinking populations of freshwater resident O. mykiss are vulnerable to loss of
genetic diversity and fitness, including the potential loss of genes associated
with anadromy.”  AR 144. 
Given future opportunity through restoration activity, resident O.
mykiss could therefore support re-establishing viable steelhead
populations.  Int. Opp. at 11.
Large dams and
obstructions have blocked off much of the historical spawning and rearing
habitat of steelhead.  AR 147.  Due to these ongoing threats, populations of
resident O. mykiss are now “vulnerable to loss of genetic diversity and
fitness, including the potential loss of genes associated with anadromy.”  Id.
 Currently, the “fraction of [resident O.
mykiss] population expressing anadromy has been pushed to the brink of
extinction” and this pressure will prevent the transmission of anadromy to
future progeny.  AR 612. 
Int. Opp. at 11.
Intervenors
conclude that the record thus provides sufficient information showing that the
loss of resident O. mykiss in co-existing watersheds with steelhead
would hasten SCS extirpation.  AR 148.  The record shows that “limited consideration
of purely anadromous fish for the recovery goal is biologically
inappropriate for this species,” and [] an important consideration to prevent
extinction is ‘protecting existing populations and all life history expressions.”
AR 161. 
NMFS indicates that protection of resident O. mykiss is crucial
given “their importance to the viability of anadromous [] populations.”  AR 162.  Scientific evidence indicates that “[t]he
future of [anadromous O. mykiss]…will depend on a suite of carefully
planned and expeditiously implemented recovery actions but most importantly,
recognition that protecting both resident and anadromous O. mykiss together is
beneficial for the recovery of the species as a whole.” SAR 3959.  Int. Opp. at 11-12.
Intervenors add
that juvenile resident and anadromous O. mykiss are nearly
indistinguishable without genetic, morphological, or physiological
evaluations.  AR 139. The early life stages of the resident
and the anadromous O. mykiss are extremely similar until the anadromous
form migrates to the ocean. AR 140.  Juvenile resident and anadromous O. mykiss
both reside in freshwater.  AR 15-16.  O. mykiss embryos take anywhere from
“three weeks to two months to hatch depending on water temperature” and then
continue to grow for “an additional 1-4 years” before each form diverges in its
migration route.  AR 15-16.  For these reasons, the CalTrout petition and
DFW concluded it would be practically impossible to protect only juvenile
anadromous O. mykiss and not also the resident form.  Int. Opp. at 12.
District
replies that these arguments are a sleight of hand that asks for
protection for both resident and anadromous O. mykiss while
simultaneously arguing that data limited to anadromous O.mykiss is
sufficient to support the Commission’s findings.  DFW’s evaluation expressly stated that
“[m]uch of the information presented in the [CalTrout] Petition is focused on
the anadromous life history” of steelhead. 
AR 142.  The assertion of an interconnection between
the two life histories is part of this shell game of ignoring rainbow trout
populations (which are plentiful) while simultaneously claiming that both
resident and anadromous populations should be protected.  This unsupported leap purposefully omits
information related to resident rainbow trout populations and therefore the Commission’s
findings are unsupported by evidence.  Reply
at 2-3.
District argues that it and others presented
extensive evidence demonstrating the impropriety of failing to consider
resident rainbow trout in connection with population, abundance and range, while
simultaneously seeking to protect them.   See
AR 240-41; SAR 5282 (CalTrout’s petition’s population viability
goal inappropriately depends on models that consider only anadromous spawners
and disregards the contributions of resident O. mykiss);  AR 241-42; SAR 5405, 5426 (citing most recent NMFS five-year
review recommending criteria that protected only anadromous O. mykiss
and acknowledging that further scientific research is needed to fill “key
knowledge gaps”); AR 241; SAR 3948-68 (2020
study and NMFS five-year review showing that resident and anadromous forms are
tightly integrated at the population level); AR
242-43 (discussing evidence of abundant rainbow trout and suggesting levels of
anadromy may be tightly related to variable environmental conditions); AR 245; SAR 3634 (discussing discrepancies in CalTrout
petition and DFW recommendation against listing northern California summer
steelhead ecotypes because it failed to meet the definition of a subspecies—a
finding that equally applies to anadromous and resident O. mykiss); AR 508-18 (discussing disconnect between
evidence presented on anadromous life histories and CalTrout petition’s
protection of both resident and anadromous life histories); AR 513 (discussing evidence that returning
steelhead “likely originate as migratory smolts produced from resident
headwater trout populations, many of which persist above man-made and natural
barriers to anadromy” and “the polygenic nature of anadromy indicates that the
trait can persist for a long time in a large resident population.”).  Reply at 3-4.
In other words, the Commission’s findings are
doublespeak.  They assert the
interconnection of resident and anadromous O. mykiss while
simultaneously asserting that the abundance, population, range, and
distribution of resident O. mykiss may be disregarded in determining
whether both resident and anadromous fish are threatened or endangered.  There is little to no evidence in the CalTrout
petition that resident O. mykiss are threatened, let alone
endangered.  DFW was so confused that it
was forced to ask CalTrout to clarify whether it sought to list both anadromous
and resident O. mykiss.  AR 138. 
Although CalTrout clarified, it did not submit any additional evidence
demonstrating any threat to resident O. mykiss.  Reply at 4-5.

Intervenors argue
that District is quibbling with the evidence at this early stage in the
process, which is something that CBD
expressly forbade: “[I]f the information clearly would lead a reasonable person
to conclude there is a substantial possibility that listing could occur,
rejection of the petition is outside the Commission’s range of discretion under
section 2074.2.” 166 Cal.App.4th at 611.  The Commission may not choose to reject
a listing petition by “choos[ing] between conflicting inferences on subordinate
issues….”  Id. at 611.  Where there are “conflicting inferences” that
can be drawn from existing information on population trend and abundance, the
Commission is bound to accept the petition
for further consideration.  Even if the
“balance is unclear” and there is evidence or argument to the contrary, CBD requires the court to “defer to
the Commission.” Id. at 611.  The Commission exercised its expert judgment
and made its decision based on the available evidence and DFW’s evaluation, and
accepted CalTrout’s petition for further consideration. Petitioner’s quibble
about the sufficiency of information or “conflicting inferences” does not
warrant disturbing that decision.  Int.
Opp. at 13-14.
District replies
that this is not a case of conflicting inferences or even one where the balance
is unclear.  Far from being a quibble, there are large
swaths of required information missing which are relevant to the population
that the CalTrout petition seeks to protect—namely both resident and anadromous
O. mykiss.  There is no
conflicting inference on whether rainbow trout populations are healthy and
abundant because they are.  While there
are many differences in opinion on the meaning and import of the evidence
presented to the Commission, District is not asking the court to reweigh that
evidence or engage in an evaluation of conflicting inferences.  Instead, it is asking that a petition seeking
to protect both resident and anadromous O. mykiss should contain
sufficient information about both as required by 14 CCR section 670.1 (d)(1) and F&G Code section 2073.2.  Reply at 10.
The court accepts the
fact that District is contending that the record lacks information on rainbow
trout population trends and abundance, and it is not claiming different
inferences from the evidence.  While
District is correct that there are no real numbers for the population trend and
abundance of rainbow trout, there is no requirement in F&G Code section
2073.2 that there be any.  
The Commission is
required to assess the F&G Code section 2073.2 factors collectively and the
record shows that steelhead are clearly at risk of extirpation as their
returning population has declined from between 32,000 to 46,000 returning
adults to less than 500  (AR 9-10, 142-43), SCS are located in coastal
rivers downstream of total barriers and are cut off from about 60% of their
historical range (AR 13, 144), steelhead
had estimated annual runs in the tens of thousands while current annual runs
are only in the single digits (AR 13-15,
144-45), abundance numbers have not increased since steelhead were listed as
endangered under the federal ESA in 1997 (AR 14), and steelhead populations appear to
be extremely depressed and it is likely that remaining populations are in
immediate danger of extirpation (AR 19-20,
148).
Rainbow trout play an important role in maintaining the
anadromous life history of steelhead because they can and do produce offspring that express the
anadromous life history, making them an important genetic reservoir to support
the anadromous life history.  In other
words, the relationship between steelhead and rainbow trout, described by the
parties as plasticity – meaning the expression of anadromy or residency is
based on a combination of the fish’s genes, individual condition, and
environmental factors – means that steelhead can survive prolonged droughts and
resume anadromous behavior when flow conditions allow for resumed connection
between their natal freshwater streams and the ocean.  AR 23.
 
The scientific
evidence is that large dams and other substantial migration barriers have made
it far less likely for adult steelhead to successfully return to their natal
streams and spawn.  AR 9-10.  As a result, the historical populations in
these watersheds have declined over 90%.  AR 10.  With
these barriers in place, the continued survival of steelhead relies on resident
O. mykiss to produce anadromous offspring (smolts) which can then later
make it successfully to the ocean.  AR 140.  Such smolts are a critical contribution to the
population of the remaining oceangoing steelhead found in Southern California
ocean waters because they create the potential for adult steelhead to return
and spawn successfully in freshwaters when barriers to anadromy are reduced.  AR 16, AR 140, 144.  Accordingly, a key factor in the future
survival of steelhead is the production of smolts as the offspring of resident
adult O. mykiss.  AR 140.
A winter 2020 study
of O. mykiss found that its protection required a suite of carefully
planned and expeditiously implemented recovery actions.  SAR 6594. 
It also required recognition that protecting both resident and
anadromous O. mykiss will help recovery of the species as a whole.  SAR 6594. 
Rainbow trout can express anadromy and reestablish a non-existent
anadromous population.  AR 14.  This means that resident freshwater
populations preserve the alleles needed for anadromy, and they could support
re-establishing viable anadromous populations. 
AR 14.  This also means that a
resident freshwater life-history strategy plays a central role to the continued
existence of the O. mykiss.  AR
14.  Unless the loss of habitat for
anadromous O. mykiss is reversed, there will be a greater need for
resident freshwater rainbow trout to produce smolts that express anadromy and
enter the Pacific Ocean.  AR 14.
These facts are
dispositive for the conclusion that the Commission had substantial evidence that
SCS is a candidate for endangered species listing.  See CBD, supra, 66 Cal.App.4th at 611.  District may be correct that an evaluation of
rainbow trout abundance and its ability to produce smolts is required before
SCS could be the subject of stage two protection for an endangered species.  But that is not required for stage one
candidacy.  There is substantial scientific
evidence from which a reasonable person could conclude there is a substantial
possibility that listing of SCS may be warranted.  
3. The 2084 Exception
            After the Commission made its
determination affording SCS protection from take under CESA during the candidacy period, the
Commission adopted an emergency regulation to authorize take of SCS under
certain conditions, including that the entity already possess an incidental
take permit under the federal ESA.  AR 1614, 1700-02, 1831-36, 1849-56.
            The District contends that the Commission’s
decision to reject the District’s proposed 2084
exception and implement a more stringent exception that does not allow
incidental take where a project is required by court decree but does not have a
federal incidental take authorization, risks harming anadromous steelhead and
is thus arbitrary and capricious.  An
agency action is necessarily arbitrary and capricious when it is inconsistent
with and undermines the purpose of the statute. 
McGill v. Regents of Univ. of
Cal., (1986) 44 Cal. App. 4th 1776, 1786;
Govt. Code § 11342.2 (“no
regulation is valid or effective unless consistent and not in conflict with the
statute and reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute”).  Pet. Op. Br. at 12, 14.
            The Commission’s rejection of District’s
proposed 2084 exception and its
implementation of a more stringent exception that disallows incidental take on the
projects and activities that District is legally required to perform under a federal
court order risks harming steelhead. 
This is because District’s court-mandated actions are carefully designed
to protect federally listed steelhead.  District’s
Freeman Dam operates in accordance with a 2016 NMFS mandate and federal court
injunction which imposes standards from a final (but unadopted) 2008 Biological Opinion issued by NMFS.  AR 1252-68. 
The 2008 standard permits incidental
take of two adults and 90 anadromous steelhead per year.  District’s current operations of the Freeman
Dam fish ladder are in accordance with Streambed Alteration Agreement No.
5-443-89 and the terms and conditions of Clean
Water Act Section 404 permit 86-116-TS.  Id. 
In other words, water diversion and fish ladder operations at the Freeman
Dam are highly regulated.  The permanent
injunction requires District to design and construct a new fish passage
facility in coordination with NMFS, the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and DFW. 
All these requirements serve to protect anadromous O. mykiss.  By extending
CESA’s protections to the abundant rainbow trout and by refusing to allow
incidental take of that abundant resident form, the Commission’s 2084 exception
threatens to delay District’s court-mandated project to build a new fish
passage facility and threatens anadromous O. mykiss. 
As such, the Commission’s decision to implement a stringent 2084 exception is arbitrary and capricious.  Pet. Op. Br. at 12-13.
            The Commission argues that
District’s claim is moot.  “A case is
moot when the decision of the reviewing court can have no practical impact or
provide the parties effectual relief.”  MHC
Operating Ltd. Partnership v. City of San Jose, (2003) 106
Cal.App.4th 204, 214; but see Doe v. Wilson, (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 296, 304 (judicial review of emergency
regulation not always barred on mootness grounds where it may be replaced by
permanent regulation).  The only relief
that District could obtain under the APA
is a declaration that the emergency regulation is void.  Govt. Code §11350.  However, an emergency regulation can exist
for only 180 days from the date of its filing. 
 Govt.
Code §11346.1(e).  The Commission’s emergency
regulation was filed with the Secretary of State on May 16, 2022 (AR 1832) and became inoperative on or about
November 12, 2022.  The Commission
concludes that District’s fact-specific claim should be dismissed as moot.  Comm. Opp. at 18.
            District does not reply to this
argument.  As a result, it does not
contend that its claim concerning the 2084 exception is not moot because an
exception to the mootness doctrine applies, such as if the Commission were in
the process of promulgating a permanent regulation.  The claim is moot. 
            If, arguendo, District’s
claim is not moot, it fails on the merits. 
District offers no evidence that the 2084 exception’s failure to permit
the take of rainbow trout during the candidacy period “threatens to delay” its efforts
to retrofit the Freeman Dam.  District
also does not explain how the 2084 exception’s protection of rainbow trout from
take during the candidacy period threatens to delay District’s efforts to
design a new fish passage facility to avoid take of federally listed
steelhead.  Comm. Opp. at 18-19; see Int.
Opp. at 15.
            Moreover, District’s fact-specific
claim does not undermine the Commission’s general decision to require the
existence of a federal ESA take permit as
a condition of qualifying for take authorization under CESA. 
That is a reasonable choice for a regulation of general applicability,
especially given the Commission’s express recognition that DFW could address
“unique situations” like District’s on an individual basis by issuing a take
permit pursuant to F&G Code section
2081.  AR
1631-32, 1637, 1680.  See Comm.
Opp. at 19; Int. Opp. at 15.[8]
 
            F. Conclusion
The Petition is denied. 
The Commission’s counsel is ordered to prepare a proposed judgment,
serve it on all other counsel for approval as to form, wait ten days after
service for any objections, meet and confer if there are objections, and then
submit the proposed judgment along with a declaration stating the
existence/non-existence of any unresolved objections.  An OSC re: judgment is set for December 7,
2023 at 9:30 a.m.
