And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Plaintiff's motion for attorney's indemnity, to vacate debtor's exam, and for voir dire of the Court. The Judge finds that there is no basis for the request to cut off the fees for fees owed to Defendant McDonald. The Judge also finds that Plaintiff's request to vacate the debtor's exam is unfounded, and that Plaintiff should comply with the procedures available for her to appear through a guardian ad litem if she is truly incompetent. Finally, the Judge finds that there is no basis for the request to voir dire the Court based on the Judge's prior employment with the Department of Justice, as the Judge was not involved in any criminal proceedings involving the Plaintiff.
