 Case Number:  23SMCV00439    Hearing Date:   October 5, 2023    Dept:  205 HEARING DATE:  October 5, 2023 JUDGE/DEPT:  Moreton/Beverly Hills, 205 CASE NAME: Capital One, N.A. v. Jonathan Roudier CASE NUMBER:  23SMCV00439  COMP. FILED:  February 1, 2023    PROCEEDINGS:  REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT MOVING PARTY:  Capital One, N.A. RESPONDING PARTY: Jonathan Roudier  BACKGROUND This case arises from monies owed on a credit card account.  Defendant Jonathan Roudier applied for and received a credit card account which is owned and administered by Plaintiff Capital One N.A.  Defendant defaulted on making monthly payments, and Plaintiff has brought this action to recover the outstanding balance on the credit card account.   On February 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendant.  The Complaint alleges common counts for account stated and unjust enrichment.  The Complaint seeks $31,778.73 in damages.    Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing Defendant was personally served with the Complaint on June 23, 2023.  Defendant was obligated to respond within 30 days. Defendant did not do so. Plaintiff successfully requested the entry of Defendant’s default, which was entered by the Clerk’s Office on August 14, 2023.  Plaintiff requested a default judgment on August 1, 2023.  Plaintiff served Defendant by mail with both the Request for Entry of Default and Request for Default Judgment.  Defendant has not appeared.  RELIEF REQUESTED  Default judgment against Defendant for a total of $32,440.73, which is comprised of: (1) $31,778.73, for damages, and (2) $662, for costs.   ANALYSIS  Code of Civil Procedure section 585 sets forth the two options for obtaining a default judgment. First, where the plaintiff’s complaint¿seeks compensatory damages only, in a sum certain which is readily ascertainable from the allegations of the complaint or statement of damages, the clerk may enter the default judgment for that amount. However, if the relief requested in the complaint is more complicated, consisting of either nonmonetary relief, or monetary relief in amounts which require either an accounting, additional evidence, or the exercise of judgment to ascertain, the plaintiff must request entry of judgment by the court. In such cases, the plaintiff must affirmatively establish his entitlement to the specific judgment requested.¿ (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 287.) Section 585 also allows for interest, costs and attorney fees, where otherwise allowed by law. (Code of Civ. Proc.  585(a).)  Multiple specific documents are required, such as: (1) form CIV 100, (2) a brief summary of the case; (3) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (4) interest computations as necessary; (5) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (CRC Rule 3.1800.)  Here, Plaintiff has properly complied with all the substantive and procedural requirements for a default judgment. Substantively, Plaintiff declares via declaration that there have been damages in the amount of $31,778.73 as amounts owing on Defendant’s credit card account.  A memorandum of costs for $662 has been provided in item 7 of Plaintiff’s CIV-100 form.  The evidence submitted (the statement of balance owed) is authenticated by further declaration.  Procedurally, Plaintiff properly served Defendant more than 30 days prior to requesting entry of default and default judgment, correctly completed JC Form CIV-100 in a manner that would not void or put at issue the entry of default, requested dismissal of the doe defendants, provided a declaration of non-military status, requested damages in amounts supported by the filings and not in excess of the amount stated in the Complaint, and filed a proposed judgment (JUD-100).   As default has already been entered and there has been no appearance or filing whatsoever from Defendant, default judgment is appropriate here.   CONCLUSION AND ORDER   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff Capital One, N.A.’s Request for Default Judgment is GRANTED as to Defendant Jonathan Roudier.  Default judgment in the amount of $32,440.73 is awarded in favor of Plaintiff.
