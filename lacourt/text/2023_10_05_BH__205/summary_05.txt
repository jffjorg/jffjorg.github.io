And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is in favor of Capital One, N.A., granting their request for a default judgment against Jonathan Roudier. The case arises from a credit card account that Roudier defaulted on, leaving an outstanding balance of $31,778.73. Capital One brought the action to recover the outstanding balance and served Roudier with the complaint, but Roudier did not respond. As a result, the court entered a default judgment against Roudier, awarding Capital One $32,440.73, which includes the outstanding balance and costs. The judge concludes that the default judgment is appropriate given Roudier's failure to respond to the complaint and the fact that all necessary documents have been filed.
