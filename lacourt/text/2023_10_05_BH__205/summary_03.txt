And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling is a decision by Judge Edward B. Moreton, Jr. regarding Plaintiff Jocelyn Donald's motion for reconsideration of the Court's order of dismissal. The Court dismisses the case without prejudice after Plaintiff fails to appear at an ordered court date (OSC) due to a misunderstanding about the stay of default proceedings. The Plaintiff argues that the Court's dismissal was in error and seeks to reconsider the order. The Court grants the motion for reconsideration, citing its inherent authority to correct an erroneous ruling. The Court sets a case management conference for December 5, 2023 at 9:00 a.m.
