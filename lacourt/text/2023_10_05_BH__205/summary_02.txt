And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling is that the Plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions is granted. The Defendant, Paola Joice Miller, has failed to comply with several court orders, including failing to appear for a deposition and failing to pay monetary sanctions. The Court has previously granted a motion to compel deposition and awarded sanctions against the Defendant, but the Defendant has continued to fail to comply. The Judge finds that the Defendant's actions have been willful and that less severe sanctions have not served to curb the Defendant's discovery abuses. Therefore, the Judge concludes that terminating sanctions are warranted, and the Defendant's answer is stricken. The Plaintiffs are ordered to provide a proposed default judgment by November 6, 2023, and a status conference is set for December 6, 2023 to consider entry of default judgment.
