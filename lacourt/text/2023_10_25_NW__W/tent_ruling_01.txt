BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Mark A. Liker alleges
Defendant Eliezer Appel, in his capacity as a California licensed attorney,
instructed Plaintiff to purchase certain real property for $250,000.00 and promised
Plaintiff a return on his investment as well as plaintiff would take ownership
of the property or that the property would secure Plaintiff’s investment.
Plaintiff further alleges Eliezer Appel concealed from Plaintiff the fact that plaintiff
did not own the property or the company that took title to the property that
is, the Defendant Lockhart Development, Inc., and that Eliezer Appel took Plaintiff’s
investment for his own gain. 
 
On November 24, 2020, Plaintiff Mark A.
Liker filed a complaint against Defendants Eliezer Appel, Lockhart Development,
Inc., and Cochran Inc., asserting a single cause of action for fraud. Plaintiff
filed a Second Amended Complaint on August 30, 2023, asserting new causes of
action – breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, intentional
misrepresentation, conspiracy to commit fraud, and breach of attorney fiduciary
duty/duty of loyalty. 
 
On February 11, 2021, Lockhart
Development, Inc. filed a cross-complaint against Mark A. Liker, asserting
causes of action for (1) Breach of Written Contract; (2) Intentional or
Negligent Interference with Contractual Relations; (3) Interference with
Prospective Economic Advantage; (4) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (5) Declaratory
Relief; (6) Implied Contractual Indemnity; and (7) Slander of Title. 
 
On October 20, 2022, Appel filed a
cross-complaint against Liker, the California Neurological Institute, and Avi
Marciano asserting causes of action for (1) Violation of Physician’s Medical
Practice Act (MPA); (2) Undue Influence (CA Welfare & Institutions Code
15610.70); (3) Negligent Infliction of Extreme Emotional Distress (NIED); (4) Intentional
Infliction of Extreme Emotional Distress (IIED); (5) Intentional Interference with
Prospective Economic Advantage; and (6) Civil Extortion.      
 
This action is related to Marc A.
Larocque v. Christine Larocque Franz, et al. (LC105233). 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Cross-Defendant Mark A. Liker’s Second Motion
to Compel Lockhart Development Inc. to Respond to Requests for Production of
Documents and Request for Sanctions is GRANTED.  
 
discussion
 
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Mark A. Liker moves the court for a
third order compelling Defendant Lockhart Development Inc. to obey this Court’s
previous orders and produce documents requested in the “NOTICE TO APPEAR AND TO
PRODUCE AT JUDGMENT DEBTOR EXAMINATION” pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
sections 708.030 and 2031.010 to 2031.320 as well as request sanctions. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 708.030 provides that a “judgment
creditor may demand that any judgment debtor produce and permit the party
making the demand ... to inspect and to copy a document that is in the
possession, custody, or control of the party on whom the demand is made in the
manner provided in Chapter 14 (commencing with Section 2031.010) of Title 4 of
Part 4, if the demand requests information to aid in enforcement of the money
judgment.” (See Li v. Yan (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 56, 65 n. 3.)
 
The court previously granted Liker’s first and second motions to
compel Defendant Lockhart Development Inc. to respond and produce documents
requested in the “NOTICE TO APPEAR AND TO PRODUCE AT JUDGMENT DEBTOR
EXAMINATION”. (See May 5, 2023 and August 4, 2023 Minute Order.) In Liker’s
first request, the court ordered all responsive documents in Lockhart’s
possession to be produced within 30 days. (May 5, 2023 Minute Order.) The court
denied Liker’s request for sanctions. (May 5, 2023 Minute Order.) In the August
4, 2023 Minute Order, the court ordered Lockhart Development Inc. to respond to
requests for production of documents. (August 4, 2023 Minute Order.) The court
initially granted Liker’s request for sanctions, but ultimately continued the
matter to today’s hearing. (August 4, 2023 Minute Order.)
 
Due to Lockhart’s continual failure to comply with prior court
orders, the court GRANTS Liker’s motion to compel Lockhart Development Inc. to Respond to Requests for Production of
Documents. Written responses and documents must be provided within ten days. The
court further GRANTS Liker’s request for sanctions in the amount of $5,625.00.
