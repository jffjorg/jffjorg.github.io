Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Weber & Associates and Spencer Weinerman, have moved to dismiss the action for failure to prosecute. The plaintiff, Grant & Weber, alleges breach of fiduciary duty and misappropriation of trade secrets. The defendants argue that the action has not been brought to trial within the five-year deadline and is therefore subject to mandatory dismissal under Code of Civil Procedure section 583.360. The court disagrees, finding that the six-month extension provided by Judicial Council Emergency Rule 10(a) applies to the case. Therefore, the defendants' motion to dismiss is denied.
