Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Robin La Due's motion for an order to deposit and secure funds in the court's registry. The motion is denied without prejudice. The court found that the relief requested by Plaintiff is not based on any legal authority, affidavits, or admissible evidence. The court agrees with Defendant Shahe Boyadjian's opposition to the motion, citing that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Code of Civil Procedure do not provide any basis for the court to grant Plaintiff's request. The court notes that Plaintiff failed to provide any supporting legal authority in their brief and that their argument is unsubstantiated.
