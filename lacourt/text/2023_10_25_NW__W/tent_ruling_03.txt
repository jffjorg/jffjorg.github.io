FACTUAL
BACKGROUND
 
On August 6, 2018, Plaintiff Grant & Weber filed a complaint
against Weber & Associates and Spencer Weinerman asserting causes of action
for (1) Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Duty of Loyalty; (2) Misappropriation of
Trade Secrets under California Civil Code § 3426, et seq.; (3) Misappropriation
of Trade Secrets under 18 U.S.C. § 1836; (4) Tortious Interference with
Prospective Economic Relations; (5) Unfair Competition under Common Law and
California Business and Professions Code § 17200, Et. Seq.; (6) Constructive
Trust; (7) Declaratory Relief; and (8) Accounting. 
 
Plaintiff alleges in direct violation of his duty as a Member of
the Board of Directors of Plaintiff, Defendant Weinerman opened a competing
receivables management company, mainly Defendant Weber and Associates
(“W&A”). Plaintiff further alleges Weinerman then contacted all of
Plaintiff’s current clients and requested that they immediately stop doing
business with Plaintiff, and instead do all future business with W&A. By
virtue of Weinerman’s actions, Plaintiff alleges he has usurped the corporate
opportunity and has also received personal compensation as a result in
violation of express law. 
 
On May 10, 2021, this action was related to Spencer Weinennan,
Individual and Trustee v. Ron Grossblatt, et. al. (21VECP00229) and Spencer
Weinerman, et. al. v. Ron Grossblatt, et. al. (19VECV00088).
 
TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is DENIED.

 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendants Weber
& Associates and Spencer Weinerman, an individual and Trustee of The
Weinerman Family Trust move the court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
§583.360 for mandatory dismissal of this action. 
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
583.310, “[a]n action shall be brought to trial within five years after the
action is commenced against the defendant.” “In computing the time within which
an action must be brought to trial pursuant to this article, there shall be
excluded the time during which any of the following conditions existed: (a) The
jurisdiction of the court to try the action was suspended. (b) Prosecution or
trial of the action was stayed or enjoined. (c) Bringing the action to trial,
for any other reason, was impossible, impracticable, or futile.”  (CCP §
583.340.) “An action shall be dismissed by the court on its own motion or on
motion of the defendant, after notice to the parties, if the action is not
brought to trial within the time prescribed in this article.” (CCP §
583.360(a).)
 
Defendants argue the action has not been
brought to trial within five years. The instant action was filed on August 6,
2018. As a result, the five-year deadline to bring the matter to trial was
August 6, 2023. Defendants further argue Judicial Council Emergency Rule 10
does not apply because Courts of California have determined that Emergency Rule
10(a) does not and cannot alter Code of Civil Procedure section 583.360. Defendants
cite Ables v. A. Ghazale Brothers, Inc. (2022) 74 Cal.App.5th 823 to
support their position.
 
Pursuant to
Emergency Rule 10(a), “Notwithstanding any other law, including Code of Civil
Procedure section 583.310, for all civil actions filed on or before April 6,
2020, the time in which to bring the action to trial is extended by six months
for a total time of five years and six months.”  (Cal. R. App. I Emergency
Rule 10(a).) Defendants’ reliance on Ables is unavailing.  In that case, the plaintiff did not bring the
case to trial within five and a half years of the filing date.  The plaintiff sought to take advantage of Section
583.350, which provides that, if the time within which an action must be
brought to trial is "tolled or otherwise extended pursuant to
statute," the action "shall not be dismissed ... if the action is
brought to trial within six months after the end of the period of tolling or
extension." ( § 583.350.)  The Ables
court concluded that plaintiff could not invoke Section 583.350 because
Rule 10(a) was not a statute and so the tolling provision did not apply.   The court did not in anyway hold that a
party could not rely on the six month period provided by the emergency rule to
extend the five year rule.  
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is DENIED.
