And here is a summary of the tentatively ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting Plaintiff AIMCO Venezia LLC's request for default judgment against Defendants Christian Villar and The Villar Group. The case arises from a landlord-tenant dispute over the subletting of an apartment at Lincoln Place, a residential complex owned and operated by Plaintiff. The Lease agreement prohibits subletting and specifies liquidated damages of $250 per day for unauthorized rentals. Despite this, Defendant Kevin Dalit sublet the apartment to Christian Villar and The Villar Group, who then hosted numerous unauthorized short-term renters. The Villar Defendants were served with the complaint but failed to respond, and default was entered against them. The Plaintiff has complied with all substantive and procedural requirements for a default judgment and is entitled to damages of $20,250, attorneys' fees of $5,000, and costs of $9,285.94. The Court finds that default judgment is appropriate given the Villar Defendants' failure to respond to the complaint, and grants the Plaintiff's request for default judgment in the amount of $34,535.94.

**English Summary:**

This tentative ruling concerns a landlord-tenant dispute where Plaintiff AIMCO Venezia LLC is seeking a default judgment against Defendants Christian Villar and The Villar Group. The case stems from Defendant Kevin Dalit leasing an apartment at Lincoln Place, a property owned by Plaintiff, and subsequently subletting it to Defendants Villar for unauthorized short-term rentals, violating the terms of their lease agreement.

While Plaintiff and Kevin Dalit reached a settlement agreement, resulting in Dalit's dismissal from the case, Defendants Villar failed to respond to the lawsuit, leading to default judgments against them.

The Judge finds that Plaintiff has properly followed all procedural requirements for obtaining a default judgment and has presented sufficient evidence to support the requested damages of $20,250 (liquidated damages), $5,000 (attorney's fees), and $9,285.94 (costs), totaling $34,535.94.


Therefore, the Judge tentatively grants Plaintiff's request for default judgment against Defendants Villar.

**Case Number:** 20SMCV00379

**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023

**Judge/Dept:** Moreton/Beverly Hills, 205

**Case Name:** AIMCO Venezia LLC v. Kevin Dalit, et al.

**Parties:**

- Plaintiff: AIMCO Venezia LLC
- Defendants: Kevin Dalit, Christian Villar and The Villar Group

**Background:**

This case involves a landlord-tenant dispute. AIMCO Venezia LLC owns and manages an apartment complex in Venice, California called "Lincoln Place." Kevin Dalit leased an apartment from the plaintiff and agreed not to sublet it. However, Dalit handed over possession of the apartment to Christian Villar and The Villar Group, who then subleased it as an Airbnb vacation rental. After the plaintiff discovered this, Dalit settled with the plaintiff and was dismissed from the case. The Villar Group and Christian Villar did not respond to the complaint and default was entered against them.

**Relief Requested:**

Plaintiff requests a default judgment against the Villar Defendants for a total of $34,535.94, which includes $20,250 for damages, $5,000 for attorneys' fees, and $9,285.94 for costs.

**Analysis:**

The court may grant a default judgment for a sum certain if the complaint only seeks compensatory damages. If the relief requested is more complicated, the plaintiff must request entry of judgment by the court and affirmatively establish their entitlement to the specific judgment. Here, the plaintiff has complied with all the substantive and procedural requirements for a default judgment. The plaintiff has declared damages of $20,250 and is entitled to $5,000 in attorneys' fees. A memorandum of costs of $9,285.94 is supported by invoices.

**Conclusion and Order:**

For the foregoing reasons, the plaintiff's request for default judgment is granted. Default judgment in the amount of $34,535.94 is awarded in favor of the plaintiff.
