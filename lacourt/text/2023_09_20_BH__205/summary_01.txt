And here is a summary of the tentatively ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting Plaintiff AIMCO Venezia LLC's request for default judgment against Defendants Christian Villar and The Villar Group. The case arises from a landlord-tenant dispute over the subletting of an apartment at Lincoln Place, a residential complex owned and operated by Plaintiff. The Lease agreement prohibits subletting and specifies liquidated damages of $250 per day for unauthorized rentals. Despite this, Defendant Kevin Dalit sublet the apartment to Christian Villar and The Villar Group, who then hosted numerous unauthorized short-term renters. The Villar Defendants were served with the complaint but failed to respond, and default was entered against them. The Plaintiff has complied with all substantive and procedural requirements for a default judgment and is entitled to damages of $20,250, attorneys' fees of $5,000, and costs of $9,285.94. The Court finds that default judgment is appropriate given the Villar Defendants' failure to respond to the complaint, and grants the Plaintiff's request for default judgment in the amount of $34,535.94.
