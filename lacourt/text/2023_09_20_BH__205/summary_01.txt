And here is a summary of the tentatively ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting Plaintiff AIMCO Venezia LLC's request for default judgment against Defendants Christian Villar and The Villar Group. The case arises from a landlord-tenant dispute over the subletting of an apartment at Lincoln Place, a residential complex owned and operated by Plaintiff. The Lease agreement prohibits subletting and specifies liquidated damages of $250 per day for unauthorized rentals. Despite this, Defendant Kevin Dalit sublet the apartment to Christian Villar and The Villar Group, who then hosted numerous unauthorized short-term renters. The Villar Defendants were served with the complaint but failed to respond, and default was entered against them. The Plaintiff has complied with all substantive and procedural requirements for a default judgment and is entitled to damages of $20,250, attorneys' fees of $5,000, and costs of $9,285.94. The Court finds that default judgment is appropriate given the Villar Defendants' failure to respond to the complaint, and grants the Plaintiff's request for default judgment in the amount of $34,535.94.

**English Summary:**

This tentative ruling concerns a landlord-tenant dispute where Plaintiff AIMCO Venezia LLC is seeking a default judgment against Defendants Christian Villar and The Villar Group. The case stems from Defendant Kevin Dalit leasing an apartment at Lincoln Place, a property owned by Plaintiff, and subsequently subletting it to Defendants Villar for unauthorized short-term rentals, violating the terms of their lease agreement.

While Plaintiff and Kevin Dalit reached a settlement agreement, resulting in Dalit's dismissal from the case, Defendants Villar failed to respond to the lawsuit, leading to default judgments against them.

The Judge finds that Plaintiff has properly followed all procedural requirements for obtaining a default judgment and has presented sufficient evidence to support the requested damages of $20,250 (liquidated damages), $5,000 (attorney's fees), and $9,285.94 (costs), totaling $34,535.94.


Therefore, the Judge tentatively grants Plaintiff's request for default judgment against Defendants Villar.
