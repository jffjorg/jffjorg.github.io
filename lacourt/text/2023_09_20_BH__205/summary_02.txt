## Tentative Ruling Summary:  Alexandroff v. D&A Endeavors, Inc.

**Case Number:** 21SMCV01036
**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023
**Court:** Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles - West District, Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205

**Parties:**
* **Plaintiff:** Victor Alexandroff
* **Defendant:** D&A Endeavors Inc. dba ServPro of Beverly Hills/Westwood 
* **Other:** Crestbrook Insurance Company (Crestbrook), ServPro of Sunland Tujunga (ServPro S/T), ServPro Industries, LLC (ServPro Industries)

**Summary:**

This tentative ruling addresses Defendant's motion to join Crestbrook, ServPro S/T, and ServPro Industries as necessary parties to Plaintiff's negligence claim.

**Facts:**

* Plaintiff hired Defendant to perform water damage restoration services and prepare estimates for his insurance claim.
* Plaintiff alleges Defendant's estimates were flawed and caused silica dust to spread in his home.
* Defendant invoiced Plaintiff for $72,607.78 for the work performed and claimed a percentage of any insurance payout.
*  Independently, Plaintiff's insurer, Crestbrook, filed a lawsuit against ServPro S/T and ServPro Industries alleging negligence for causing silica dust damage to Plaintiff's home. This lawsuit was settled and dismissed with prejudice.

**Legal Issues:**

* **Joinder of Parties:** Defendant argues that Crestbrook, as a partial subrogee, and ServPro S/T and ServPro Industries as alleged joint tortfeasors, are necessary parties to Plaintiff's negligence claim.
* **Statute of Limitations:** Plaintiff argues that any claims against ServPro S/T and ServPro Industries are time-barred by a one-year contractual provision.

**Ruling:**

The Court DENIES Defendant's motion to join Crestbrook, ServPro S/T, and ServPro Industries. 

* **Crestbrook:** While partial subrogees are generally necessary parties, Crestbrook's claim against Defendant is time-barred by the contractual limitations provision.
* **ServPro S/T and ServPro Industries:** Defendant's argument that they are active participants is based solely on an unverified complaint, which is not admissible evidence. Moreover, any claim against them would be time-barred.  

**Significant Statements:**

* Defendant may cross-claim against ServPro S/T and ServPro Industries for indemnity.
*  Res judicata prevents Crestbrook from re-litigating claims against ServPro S/T and ServPro Industries after their previous lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice.



**Please note:** This is a summary of the tentative ruling and does not constitute legal advice.

Summary:

Defendant seeks to join Crestbrook Insurance Company, ServPro of Sunland Tujunga, and ServPro Industries as necessary parties to Plaintiff’s third cause of action for negligence. However, the Court denies Defendant’s motion for joinder as Crestbrook cannot claim an interest in this action due to the time-barred claim against Defendant, and ServPro S/T and ServPro Industries are not necessary parties as they are joint tortfeasors and any claim against them would be dismissed due to the one-year statute of limitations in the parties’ form contract. Defendant may cross-claim against ServPro S/T and ServPro Industries for indemnity.
