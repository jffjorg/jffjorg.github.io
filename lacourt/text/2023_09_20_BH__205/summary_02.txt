## Tentative Ruling Summary:  Alexandroff v. D&A Endeavors, Inc.

**Case Number:** 21SMCV01036
**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023
**Court:** Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles - West District, Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205

**Parties:**
* **Plaintiff:** Victor Alexandroff
* **Defendant:** D&A Endeavors Inc. dba ServPro of Beverly Hills/Westwood 
* **Other:** Crestbrook Insurance Company (Crestbrook), ServPro of Sunland Tujunga (ServPro S/T), ServPro Industries, LLC (ServPro Industries)

**Summary:**

This tentative ruling addresses Defendant's motion to join Crestbrook, ServPro S/T, and ServPro Industries as necessary parties to Plaintiff's negligence claim.

**Facts:**

* Plaintiff hired Defendant to perform water damage restoration services and prepare estimates for his insurance claim.
* Plaintiff alleges Defendant's estimates were flawed and caused silica dust to spread in his home.
* Defendant invoiced Plaintiff for $72,607.78 for the work performed and claimed a percentage of any insurance payout.
*  Independently, Plaintiff's insurer, Crestbrook, filed a lawsuit against ServPro S/T and ServPro Industries alleging negligence for causing silica dust damage to Plaintiff's home. This lawsuit was settled and dismissed with prejudice.

**Legal Issues:**

* **Joinder of Parties:** Defendant argues that Crestbrook, as a partial subrogee, and ServPro S/T and ServPro Industries as alleged joint tortfeasors, are necessary parties to Plaintiff's negligence claim.
* **Statute of Limitations:** Plaintiff argues that any claims against ServPro S/T and ServPro Industries are time-barred by a one-year contractual provision.

**Ruling:**

The Court DENIES Defendant's motion to join Crestbrook, ServPro S/T, and ServPro Industries. 

* **Crestbrook:** While partial subrogees are generally necessary parties, Crestbrook's claim against Defendant is time-barred by the contractual limitations provision.
* **ServPro S/T and ServPro Industries:** Defendant's argument that they are active participants is based solely on an unverified complaint, which is not admissible evidence. Moreover, any claim against them would be time-barred.  

**Significant Statements:**

* Defendant may cross-claim against ServPro S/T and ServPro Industries for indemnity.
*  Res judicata prevents Crestbrook from re-litigating claims against ServPro S/T and ServPro Industries after their previous lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice.



**Please note:** This is a summary of the tentative ruling and does not constitute legal advice.

Defendant may cross-claim against ServPro S/T and ServPro Industries for indemnity.

## Case Summary:

**Case Number:** 21SMCV01036
**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023
**Court:** Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles – West District, Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Victor Alexandroff
* **Defendant:** D&A Endeavors Inc. dba ServPro of Beverly Hills/Westwood

**Other Involved Parties:**

* **Crestbrook Insurance Company:** Plaintiff's insurer, also sued ServPro S/T and ServPro Industries in a separate case.
* **ServPro of Sunland Tujunga (ServPro S/T):** Water damage restoration company,  previously sued by Crestbrook.

* **ServPro Industries, LLC (ServPro Industries):**  Parent company of ServPro S/T, also previously sued by Crestbrook.

**Background:**

* Victor Alexandroff hired D&A Endeavors (ServPro) to restore his home after water damage.
* Alexandroff claims ServPro's estimates were inaccurate, and their work caused silica dust contamination.
* Alexandroff fired ServPro and they invoiced him $72,607.78.
* ServPro claims Alexandroff owes them money and is entitled to a percentage of any insurance payout.

* Crestbrook filed a separate lawsuit against ServPro S/T and ServPro Industries, alleging negligence for silica dust contamination, claiming they caused the damage two months before ServPro was hired.
* Crestbrook's lawsuit settled with ServPro S/T and ServPro Industries before trial.

**Legal Issues:**

* **Joinder of Parties:** ServPro is asking the court to join Crestbrook and ServPro S/T/Industries as parties to Alexandroff's negligence claim.

* **Statute of Limitations:**  The key issue is whether any claims against ServPro S/T and ServPro Industries are barred by the one-year statute of limitations in the contract between Alexandroff and ServPro.

**Judge's Ruling:**

* **Crestbrook:** The judge denies joining Crestbrook because their potential claim against ServPro is time-barred.
* **ServPro S/T and ServPro Industries:** The judge also denies joining  ServPro S/T and ServPro Industries because:
    * There is no evidence they were active participants in the alleged wrongdoing.
    * Any claims against them would be time-barred. 
    * Joining them would be a waste of judicial resources and raise res judicata concerns based on the prior lawsuit settled by Crestbrook.

**Significant Statements:**

* The judge emphasizes that ServPro can still pursue indemnity claims against ServPro S/T and ServPro Industries.
