And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on the Plaintiff's application for a pre-trial writ of possession. The case arises from a breach of a car sales contract between the Plaintiff, Santander Consumer USA Inc. dba Chrysler Capital, and the Defendant, Ellen Karen Lang. The Plaintiff seeks to obtain possession of the car, a 2019 Jeep Cherokee, due to the Defendant's default on the contract. The Plaintiff has failed to provide the required notice to the Defendant, as mandated by Code of Civil Procedure § 512.040, and therefore the application is denied without prejudice.
