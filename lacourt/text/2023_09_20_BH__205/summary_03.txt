## English-text Summary

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Santander Consumer USA Inc.'s (Chrysler) application for a pre-trial writ of possession to reclaim a 2019 Jeep Cherokee from Ellen Karen Lang.

The denial is based on procedural defects in the notice of application Chrysler provided to Ms. Lang. Specifically, the notice failed to include required information about the hearing, the potential for Ms. Lang to oppose the writ, and the opportunity to seek legal advice.

While the Judge acknowledges Chrysler's claim of probable validity in seeking possession due to Ms. Lang's default on the car sales contract, the procedural shortcomings necessitate the denial. The denial is without prejudice, meaning Chrysler can reapply after addressing the notice deficiencies.

```

And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on September 20, 2023, regarding a hearing on Plaintiff Santander Consumer USA Inc. dba Chrysler Capital's application for a pre-trial writ of possession. The case stems from a breach of a car sales contract, with the contract in default and a balance due and owing of $29,806.02. The Plaintiff argues that it has shown "probable validity" that it is entitled to possession of the car because of the Defendant's default on the contract.

The Judge is required to issue a writ of possession if the Plaintiff has established the probable validity of its claim to possession of the property and if the undertaking requirements of Code Civ. Proc. § 515.010 are satisfied. However, the Plaintiff's notice of application does not inform the Defendant of the required information, making it procedurally defective.

As a result, the Court denies the Plaintiff's application for a writ of possession without prejudice. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to re-file its notice of application in compliance with the required notice requirements.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Edward B. Moreton, Jr., has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's application for a pre-trial writ of possession. The plaintiff, Santander Consumer USA Inc., had applied for the writ due to the defendant's default on a car sales contract. However, the plaintiff's notice of application was procedurally defective, as it did not inform the defendant of the required information under Code of Civil Procedure § 512.040. The court found that the plaintiff had not established the probable validity of their claim to possession of the property, and therefore denied the application without prejudice. The defendant, Ellen Karen Lang, had not filed an opposition to the application. The court cited the case of Winston v. Saxon, which denied a similar application for a writ of possession due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirements. The judge ordered that the application be denied, and the case will proceed to a subsequent proceeding to determine the validity of the plaintiff's claim.

**English Summary:**

The judge has denied Chrysler's request for a writ of possession to take back the Jeep Cherokee. While Chrysler argued they are entitled to the car due to Defendant's default on the loan, the judge found that the notice Chrysler gave to Defendant was not properly formatted and lacked necessary information required by law. This means Chrysler can re-file their request with a properly formatted notice.

And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling is issued to outline the judge's thinking based on the information presented before today's hearing. The case, 23SMCV01789, involves a breach of a car sales contract between Santander Consumer USA Inc. dba Chrysler Capital (Plaintiff) and Ellen Karen Lang (Defendant). The contract is in default, with a balance due and owing of $29,806.02. The Plaintiff seeks to obtain possession of the car due to the Defendant's default. The legal standard requires the Plaintiff to establish the probable validity of its claim to possession of the property and meet certain requirements, including filing an undertaking to pay the Defendant any amount the Defendant may recover for any wrongful attachment.

The Plaintiff's notice of application does not inform the Defendant of the required information, including the time and place of the hearing, the writ will be issued if the Court finds the Plaintiff's claim is probably valid, and the Defendant's right to oppose issuance of the writ. This procedural defect renders the application procedurally defective. Therefore, the Court DENIES without prejudice the Plaintiff's application for a writ of possession.
