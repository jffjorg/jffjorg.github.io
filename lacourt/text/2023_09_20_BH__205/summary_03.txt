## English-text Summary

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Santander Consumer USA Inc.'s (Chrysler) application for a pre-trial writ of possession to reclaim a 2019 Jeep Cherokee from Ellen Karen Lang.

The denial is based on procedural defects in the notice of application Chrysler provided to Ms. Lang. Specifically, the notice failed to include required information about the hearing, the potential for Ms. Lang to oppose the writ, and the opportunity to seek legal advice.

While the Judge acknowledges Chrysler's claim of probable validity in seeking possession due to Ms. Lang's default on the car sales contract, the procedural shortcomings necessitate the denial. The denial is without prejudice, meaning Chrysler can reapply after addressing the notice deficiencies.

And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on September 20, 2023, regarding a hearing on Plaintiff Santander Consumer USA Inc. dba Chrysler Capital's application for a pre-trial writ of possession. The case stems from a breach of a car sales contract, with the contract in default and a balance due and owing of $29,806.02. The Plaintiff argues that it has shown "probable validity" that it is entitled to possession of the car because of the Defendant's default on the contract.

The Judge is required to issue a writ of possession if the Plaintiff has established the probable validity of its claim to possession of the property and if the undertaking requirements of Code Civ. Proc. § 515.010 are satisfied. However, the Plaintiff's notice of application does not inform the Defendant of the required information, making it procedurally defective.

As a result, the Court denies the Plaintiff's application for a writ of possession without prejudice. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to re-file its notice of application in compliance with the required notice requirements.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Edward B. Moreton, Jr., has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's application for a pre-trial writ of possession. The plaintiff, Santander Consumer USA Inc., had applied for the writ due to the defendant's default on a car sales contract. However, the plaintiff's notice of application was procedurally defective, as it did not inform the defendant of the required information under Code of Civil Procedure § 512.040. The court found that the plaintiff had not established the probable validity of their claim to possession of the property, and therefore denied the application without prejudice. The defendant, Ellen Karen Lang, had not filed an opposition to the application. The court cited the case of Winston v. Saxon, which denied a similar application for a writ of possession due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirements. The judge ordered that the application be denied, and the case will proceed to a subsequent proceeding to determine the validity of the plaintiff's claim.

English text:
This tentative ruling is for case number 23SMCV01789, scheduled for hearing on September 20, 2023, at the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles - West District, Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205. The case involves Plaintiff Santander Consumer USA Inc. dba Chrysler Capital and Defendant Ellen Karen Lang, among others. The dispute arises from a breach of a car sales contract, where Plaintiff is the assignor of a contract with Defendant to purchase a 2019 Jeep Cherokee. The Contract is in default, with a balance due and owing of $29,806.02 together with other charges under the contract. Plaintiff argues it has the right to immediate possession of the car due to Defendant's default on the Contract. However, the Court denies Plaintiff's application for a pre-trial writ of possession because the notice of application is procedurally defective, failing to comply with specific notice requirements under Code Civ. Proc. § 512.040. This decision does not determine the actual validity of Plaintiff's claim, which will be made in a subsequent proceeding.
