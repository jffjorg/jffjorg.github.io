And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendants' motion for summary adjudication on the first, second, and third causes of action for negligence, negligent supervision, training, and/or retention, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The court found that the defendants are immune from liability under Civ. Code § 47 and Gov. Code § 820.2.

The court concluded that the gravamen of the action was a communication act: Nolte's report to the Sheriff. The litigation privilege applies to this act, and therefore, Nolte's actions prior to making the report to the Sheriff, such as searching Plaintiff's backpack, would be protected activities. Those activities were preparatory and were done in anticipation of official proceedings, which was, in this case, making the report to the Sheriff.

The court also found that Nolte's actions were ministerial in nature, as she was required to conduct a threat assessment and make the report to the Sheriff based on school district policies. Therefore, immunity would not be available under Gov. Code § 820.2, though it would still be available under Civ. Code § 47.

The court sustained the defendants' evidentiary objections to Nolte's deposition and noted that Plaintiff's brief attempted to go beyond the scope of the supplemental briefing that the court asked for.
