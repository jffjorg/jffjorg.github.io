RULING: Granted
 
CCP § 708.510 authorizes
the Court to issue an order directing a judgment debtor to assign to a judgment
creditor or a receiver all or part of a right to payment due or to become due
to the judgment debtor. The right to payment should be assigned only to the
extent necessary to satisfy the creditor’s money judgment and that, where part
of the payments are exempt, the amount of the payments assigned should not
exceed the difference between the gross amount of the payments and the exempt amount.
(CCP§708.510(c), (d), (e) and (f).)
 
The balance of
the judgment accrues at a rate of 10% per annum. (CCP § 685.010(a).) The Court
may order assignment of the right to payment in an amount necessary to pay off
the judgment in full, including accrued interest.
 
Based on the
foregoing, the Court issues an order assigning Judgment Debtor’s right to
payment from the above named entities to Judgment Creditor to satisfy the
judgment of $50,110.41 and any interest that accrues until the judgment is paid
in full.
