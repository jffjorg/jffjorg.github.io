And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a employment discrimination case between Lauren Redmond and Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. The case involves a dispute over discovery requests and the plaintiff's failure to comply with court orders.

The judge has granted the defendant's motions to compel further responses to discovery requests, but finds that the motions are moot since the plaintiff has now provided the requested responses. The judge has also granted the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $7,500, but has denied the request for terminating sanctions.

The judge has found that the plaintiff's failure to comply with court orders was not entirely willful, and that the defendant's request for terminating sanctions is not justified. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff's medical condition may have contributed to the delay in providing discovery responses.

The case will proceed to a hearing on September 13, 2024, at which time the parties may submit on the tentative ruling.
