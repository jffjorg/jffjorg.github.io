//
DISCUSSION:
 
            Defendant
moves to compel further responses to requests for production and special
interrogatories propounded to Plaintiff. As both motions concern identical
issues and seek substantially identical relief, the Court will address the
motions jointly.
 
Procedural Posture of Motions
 
            Defendant
previously moved to compel further responses to its first set of requests for
production and special interrogatories propounded to Plaintiff on February 2,
2024. Those motions were heard on April 5, 2024, at which time the Court
granted the motions and conditioned the order to provide supplemental responses
involving medical information or records on the entry of a protective order.
(April 5, 2024 Minute Order.) Defendant’s motions are therefore only proper as
motions to compel further responses if brought as renewed motions pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 1008(b). That code section states, in relevant
part: 
 
A party who
originally made an application for an order which was refused in whole or part,
or granted conditionally or on terms, may make a subsequent application for the
same order upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, in which case it
shall be shown by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what
judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts,
circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 1008(b).) Defendant’s motions do not
specifically characterize themselves as “renewed” motions, nor do the notice of
motions reference section 1008 of the Code of Civil Procedure. However, each
motion describes itself as a “Second Motion to Compel Responses” to the
discovery requests, and Defendant’s supporting declaration identifies the
previous motion, describes the Court’s April 5, 2024 ruling, and sets forth the
subsequent factual developments giving rise to these new motions. (See Declarations
of Eric W. May ISO Mots. ¶¶ 7-12.) The Court therefore construes the Motions as
renewed motions to compel further responses pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1008(b), as the motions are substantially compliant with that
statute’s requirements. 
 
Legal Standard
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (a), a court
may order a party to serve a further response to a demand for inspection when
the court finds that: “(1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete[;] (2) A representa-tion of inability to comply is inadequate,
incomplete, or evasive[; or] (3) An objection in the response is without merit
or too general.”
 
The burden is on the moving party to “set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) These facts must also be set forth in a separate
statement filed by the moving party. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1345(c).) This
burden “is met simply by a fact-specific showing of relevance.” (TBG Ins.
Servs. Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (a), a court
may order a party to serve a further response to an interrogatory when the
court finds that: “(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete[;] (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section
2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is
inadequate[; or] (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too
general.”  The burden is on the
responding party to justify any objection or failure to fully answer the
interrogatories. Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th
245, 255.
 
Timeliness
 
A motion to compel further
responses to requests for production or interrogatories must be served “within
45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding
party and the responding party have agreed in writing.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2030.300(c); 2031.310(c).) The 45-day requirement is mandatory and
jurisdictional. (Sexton v. Superior Court¿(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403,
1410.)
 
Defendant served Requests for
Production (Set One) on Plaintiff on July 13, 2023, and Special Interrogatories
on August 14, 2023. (Declarations of Eric May ISO Mots. ¶ 3, Exhs. 1.) Plaintiff
served objection-only responses on September 18, 2023. (Id. ¶ 4, Exhs. 2.)
Following an Informal Discovery Conference and multiple email exchanges, Plaintiff’s
counsel categorically stated in writing that Defendant’s time to bring this
motion has been extended indefinitely. (See Declaration of Eric May ISO Mot.
filed February 2, 2024 Exh. 10 p.5.) Although this statement does not contain a
“specific later date,” Plaintiff does not challenge the timeliness of the
motion The Court therefore finds that the motion is timely. 
 
Meet and Confer
 
A party making a motion to compel further responses must also include a
declaration stating facts showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to
resolve informally the issues presented by the motion before filing the motion.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2030.300(b)(2); 2031.310(b)(2).)
 
The Declaration of Defendant’s
counsel in support of the motion sets forth the extensive history of Defendant’s
attempts to informally resolve the dispute concerning Plaintiff’s responses to
these discovery requests. (See generally May Decls.) The Court therefore finds
that Defendant has satisfied its statutory meet and confer obligations. 
 
//
 
Defendant’s Evidentiary Objections
 
            Defendant
objects to portions of the declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel in support of the
opposition to these motions. As the evidence to which Defendant objects is not
material to the Court’s ruling, the Court declines to rule on these motions. 
 
Defendant’s Request for Judicial Notice
 
            Defendant
requests that the court take judicial notice of a series of court orders in
other actions which purportedly relate to the disciplinary history of
Plaintiff’s counsel. That history—and these orders—are entirely
irrelevant to this action. Defendant’s request is DENIED. (Gbur v. Cohen (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d
296, 301 [“[J]udicial notice . . . is always confined to those matters which
are relevant to the issue at hand.”].) 
 
Analysis
 
            Defendant
moves to compel further responses to requests for production and to special
interrogatories propounded to Plaintiff. 
 
Defendant served Requests for
Production (Set One) on Plaintiff on July 13, 2023, and Special Interrogatories
on August 14, 2023. (Declarations of Eric May ISO Mots. ¶ 3, Exhs. 1.) Plaintiff
served objection-only responses on September 18, 2023. (Id. ¶ 4, Exhs. 2.)
The parties came before the Court for an Informal Discovery Conference on
November 22, 2023, and thereupon stipulated to Plaintiff providing substantive
responses to all discovery other than those revealing medical information or
records by December 18, 2023. (May Decls. Exh. 3.). Plaintiff’s counsel sent
correspondence to Defendant’s counsel on December 18 advising that Plaintiff
had a medical emergency and required an extension on the responses. (Id.
¶ 6.) On April 5, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s original motion to compel
further responses to these requests, with the provision of supplemental
responses containing medical information due 30 days after entry of a
protective order regarding the use of those materials. (See April 5, 2024
Minute Order.) A protective order was entered on April 16, 2024. (See April 16,
2024 Order.) Plaintiff failed to provide responses by the May 16, 2024
deadline, and although Plaintiff’s counsel advised Defendant of Plaintiff’s
intention to provide supplemental responses by May 31, 2024, no responses were
received. (May Decls. ¶ 9.) On June 17, 2024, the parties attended an Informal
Discovery Conference where the Court again ordered Plaintiff to respond to the
requests by July 17, 2024. (Id. ¶ 10, Exhs. 5.) At the time this motion
was filed, no responses had been received. (Id. ¶ 12.) 
 
Plaintiff, in opposition, contends
that, since the filing of these motions, Plaintiff has served supplemental
responses to the requests for production and special interrogatories pursuant
to the Court’s order. (Declaration of Michael Freiman ISO Opp. ¶ 12.) Defendant
confirms that it has received supplemental responses, but asserts in its reply
that complete, verified responses were only provided on August 30, 2024.
Defendant therefore requests sanctions as relief for the substantial delay in
providing these responses. 
Sanctions
 
            Defendant
requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $7,500.00 on each motion, for a
total of $15,000, and terminating sanctions. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 authorizes the Court to impose
monetary sanctions on any attorney engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process by requiring that attorney to pay the reasonable expenses incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct. Code of Civil Procedure sections
2030.300(d) and 2030.310(h) require the Court to impose sanctions against any
party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response,
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.
 
A party engaging
in this conduct may be subject to nonmonetary sanctions including terminating
sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(d).)  “[T]rial courts
should select sanctions tailored to the harm caused by the misuse of the
discovery process and should not exceed what is required to protect the party
harmed by the misuse of the discovery process.” (Dept. of Forestry &
Fire Protection v. Howell (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 154, 191, disapproved of on
other grounds in Presbyterian Camp & Conference Centers, Inc. v.
Superior Court (2021) 12 Cal.5th 493.) Sanctions are generally imposed in
an incremental approach. (Id.) Generally, the appropriate sanctions when
a party repeatedly and willfully fails to provide evidence to the opposing
party as required by the discovery rules is preclusion of that evidence from
the trial. (Juarez v. Boy Scouts of America, Inc. (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th
377, 390, disapproved of on other grounds by Brown v. USA Taekwondo (2021)
11 Cal.5th 204.)
 
In considering a motion for terminating
sanctions, the Court is to attempt to “tailor the sanction to the harm caused
by the withheld discovery.” (Collisson
& Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1618-1619.)  
 
[T]he question before this court is not
whether the trial court should have imposed a lesser sanction; rather, the
question is whether the trial court abused its discretion by imposing the
sanction it chose. [Citation.] Moreover, imposition of a lesser sanction would
have permitted [defendants] to benefit from their stalling tactics. [Citation.]
The trial court did not abuse its discretion by tailoring the sanction to the
particular abuse.
 
(Id. at 1620.)  Moreover, in deciding whether to impose a
terminating sanction, the trial court is to consider the totality of the
circumstances: the “conduct of the party to determine if the actions were
willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the number of formal and
informal attempts to obtain the discovery.” (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.)
 
            Defendant
argues that Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the Court’s November 22, 2023,
April 5, 2024, and June 17, 2024 orders to provide discovery responses warrants
both monetary sanctions as remediation for the expenses incurred and
terminating sanctions. To be certain, the history of Court-ordered deadlines
with which Plaintiff has failed to comply does not weigh in Plaintiff’s favor.
However, while Defendant claims some prejudice in that Plaintiff’s August 2,
2024 deposition was hindered by the absence of these responses, the Court is
not persuaded that this event is sufficiently prejudicial to warrant the
extraordinary remedy of terminating sanctions. Nor can the Court conclude that Plaintiff’s
failure to respond to discovery was entirely willful where, even by Defendant’s
admission, medical documentation indicates that Plaintiff was incapacitated to
some degree between June 2023 and January 2024, during which time the initial
order to provide responses was made. (See Reply p.8:19-20.) The Court therefore
declines to award terminating sanctions at this time.
 
As for monetary sanctions,
Defendant seeks $7,500 in monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel
on each motion, accounting for 12 hours incurred by Attorney May on each motion
at an hourly rate of $625 per hour. (May Decls. ¶ 13.) In the Court’s view,
monetary sanctions against Plaintiff herself are unjust in these circumstances,
as Plaintiff’s counsel contends that the delay in providing responses was due
to her medical condition. Further, even if that explanation is not credited,
Defendant’s own theory justifying sanctions is grounded in the conduct of
Plaintiff’s counsel, not Plaintiff herself. With respect to sanctions
against Plaintiff’s counsel, the Court concurs that monetary sanctions are
appropriate to compensate Defendant for the expenses incurred in relation to
Plaintiff’s lengthy failure to provide proper discovery responses. As these
motions are largely duplicative, however, the Court will award sanctions in the
amount of $7,500, as requested on one motion, rather the double sanction sought
for both.  
 
CONCLUSION:

 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Renewed Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production is MOOT.
 
            Defendant’s
Renewed Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories is MOOT.
 
            Defendant’s
request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $7,500 in
total. Payment is due within 30 days of this order. 
 
            Defendant’s
request for terminating sanctions is DENIED.
