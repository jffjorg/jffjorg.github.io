Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Theresa M. Traber has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Cross-Defendants Titanium Power Group, Inc. and Anat Ghermezi to the First Amended Cross-Complaint. The Court has overruled the demurrer, finding that the Cross-Complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for breach of contract, account stated, work and labor performed, and open book account.

The Court has also rejected the demurrer's argument that the Cross-Complaint is uncertain or fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The Court has found that the allegations in the Cross-Complaint are sufficient to state claims for alter ego liability against Cross-Defendant Ghermezi.

The Court has ordered the moving parties to provide notice and has invited any party to submit on the tentative ruling. The Court will still conduct a hearing if any party appears.
