And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories and requests for production. The Court finds that Defendant has failed to justify its objections to the discovery requests and has not provided code-compliant responses. The Court orders Defendant to provide verified, code-compliant responses without objections within 30 days of the order. The Court denies Plaintiff's request for sanctions, as the notice of motion does not specify the party or attorney against whom sanctions are sought. The Court notes that the parties have agreed to extend the time to bring the motion and that Plaintiff has satisfied its statutory meet-and-confer obligations.
