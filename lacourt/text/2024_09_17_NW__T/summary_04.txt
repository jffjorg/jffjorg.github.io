And here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Vartani v Carlson, transferring the matter to the Ventura County Superior Court. The court finds that the plaintiff's position is frivolous, as the accident occurred in Ventura County, not Los Angeles County. Despite being provided with maps showing the accident location, the plaintiff's counsel continued to argue for Los Angeles County. The court awards $2,500.00 in attorney fees against the plaintiff's counsel and orders the plaintiff to pay the transfer fees for both counties within 20 days. Sanctions are payable by October 17, 2024, to the Client Trust Account of Phillips, Spallas & Angstadt LLP.
