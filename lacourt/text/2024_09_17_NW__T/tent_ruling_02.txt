 Case Number:  23VECV04435    Hearing Date:   September 17, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV04435
Ashkenazi v GM
This court
requires that every effort to resolve a discovery dispute be undertaken prior
to filing a motion to compel, regardless that attorneys believe that no meet
and confer is required if there has been no response.
Here,
discovery was served in January 2024 and an email was sent in March 2024.  Five months later, without anything further, motions were
filed.   This is inadequate and although the motions
will be granted, no monetary sanctions are awarded for failure to meet and
confer in good faith.
No
oppositions were filed.
