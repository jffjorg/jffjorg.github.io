And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Chakon v. Lee-Tyson. The plaintiff has filed an ex parte application to find that the defendant's motions to quash the service of summons are "moot." The court has denied the application. The motions to quash were filed on August 27, 2024, after service was made on August 20, 2024. The court has advanced the hearing on the motions to quash to September 26, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The plaintiff is required to send notice to all defendants by email and file proof of service. Opposition to the motions to quash is due on September 23, 2024, and replies are due on September 25, 2024, or may be made at the time of the hearing. The court notes that proof of service was not made by a registered process server and therefore cannot be accorded any presumptions. The court may hear testimony if requested.
