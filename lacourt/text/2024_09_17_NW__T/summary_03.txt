And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to the answer filed by the plaintiff, Yvette Harrell, in a case against the defendants, John Wanes and George Wanes. The judge has ruled that the plaintiff's demurrer is overruled as to the first, fourth, sixth through eighth affirmative defenses, and sustained with 20 days' leave to amend as to the second, third, and fifth affirmative defenses. The judge has also sustained the demurrer as to the ninth affirmative defense without leave to amend.

The judge found that the defendants failed to respond to the plaintiff's request for a meet and confer, despite admitting to receiving the email. The judge also found that the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient arguments to support the demurrer as to the first, fourth, sixth through eighth affirmative defenses.

The judge sustained the demurrer as to the second, third, and fifth affirmative defenses because they failed to provide supportive facts and were insufficiently pleaded. The judge also found that the ninth affirmative defense, which reserved the right to amend, was not a recognized affirmative defense and was therefore sustained without leave to amend.

The judge's ruling is tentative and will be finalized after a hearing on September 17, 2024.
