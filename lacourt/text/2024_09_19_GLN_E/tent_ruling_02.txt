TENTATIVE
RULING - MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff
filed a Complaint on 01/11/2023. The Court heard Defendant, Beny Sarksian’s,
Demurrer to the Complaint on 04/21/2023.
On 05/02/2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint (FAC) alleging the following nine causes of action: (1) Damages for
Breach of Oral Agreement, (2) Damages for Breach of Written Agreement, (3)
Damages for Breach of Fiduciary Duty, (4) Damages for Fraud, (5) Damages for
Fraud, (6) Promissory Estoppel, (7) Accounting, (8) Damages for Unjust
Enrichment, and (9) Dissolution of Partnership. The first through sixth causes
of action were alleged against Defendant Sarksian only. The seventh through
ninth causes of action were alleged against all Defendants.
On 08/18/2023, the Court heard Defendant’s demurrer to
the second, fourth, and eighth causes of action in the FAC, and the Court heard
Defendant’s motion to strike as to the FAC.
The Court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend
as to the second cause of action for breach of written agreement. The Court
sustained without leave to amend the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for
fraud (intentional misrepresentation). The Court sustained without leave to
amend the demurrer to the eighth cause of action for unjust enrichment.
On 08/28/2023, Plaintiff, Vahan Der Grigorian, filed a
Second Amended Complaint (SAC) alleging six causes of action: (1) Damages for
Breach of Oral Agreement, (2) Damages for Breach of Fiduciary Duty, (3) Damages
for Fraud (Negligent Misrepresentation), (4) Promissory Estoppel, (5)
Accounting, and (6) Dissolution of Partnership. The first through fourth causes
of action are alleged against Defendant Sarksian. The fifth through sixth
causes of action are alleged against all Defendants – Beny Sarksian and E Che
Pizza & Pasta & More LLC.
In the SAC, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant,
Sarksian, in July 2019 approached him and made a business proposal. (SAC ¶ 7.)
Plaintiff alleges that Sarksian had no financial ability to create or maintain
a business of his own and represented to Plaintiff that if Plaintiff
contributed financial resources to a restaurant business, Sarksian would handle
the day-to-day operations of the parties’ business. (SAC ¶8.)
Plaintiff alleges that Sarksian represented to
Plaintiff that Sarksian would have Defendant-LLC created and that he, Sarksian,
would manage and operate the resulting restaurant and would pay all profits
equally to Plaintiff and Sarksian. (SAC ¶9.) Plaintiff alleges that he gave
Sarksian at least $25,000.00 to form Defendant-LLC and to operate a restaurant.
(SAC ¶10.) Plaintiff alleges that pursuant to the parties’ agreement,
Defendant-LLC was created wherein Plaintiff and Sarksian were equal members in
Defendant-LLC and the restaurant business. (SAC ¶11.)
Plaintiff alleges that pursuant to the parties’
agreement, Plaintiff executed a written property lease so that Defendant-LLC
had a location from which to conduct a restaurant business. (SAC ¶12.) 
Plaintiff alleges that Sarksian failed and refused to
honor the parties’ agreement, and unbeknownst to Plaintiff, engaged in a scheme
to take, for himself and for all defendants, funds received by the restaurant
through its operations, excluding Plaintiff from those funds. (SAC ¶15.)
On 10/03/2023, Beny Sarksian filed a Cross-Complaint
against Vahan Der Grigorian alleging causes of action for: (1) Fraud and
Deceit, (2) Conversion, (3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty, (4) Constructive Trust,
(5) Accounting, and (6) Breach of Contract.
RELIEF REQUESTED
Plaintiff,
Vahan Der Grigorian, applies to this Court for an Order that Beny Sarksian
(“Defendant”) respond, without objection, to the Demand to Produce, served on
June 10, 2024; to produce documents pursuant the demand; and, imposing monetary
sanctions against Beny Sarksian and his attorney of record, Jay Stein, in the
amount of $2,563.00 for the attorney fees and costs incurred by Plaintiff in
connection with this Motion.
“This
motion is made pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2031.210,
2031.260, 2031.300 and 2023.030(a). The grounds for this motion are that
Defendant has failed to respond to discovery and has failed to resolve the
dispute in an Independent Discovery Conference with His Honor, Judge Ashfaq G.
Chowdhury on August 7, 2024. appear at their properly noticed depositions.”
(Pl. Notice p. 2.)
This
Motion is based upon this Notice, the attached Memorandum of Points and
Authorities, the Declaration of Anahid Agemian filed herewith, the records and
files in this action, and upon such further oral and documentary argument and
evidence as may be presented at or prior to the hearing on this matter.

Proof
of Service Timely Filed (CRC Rule 3.1300): Ok 
16/21 Court Days Lapsed (CCP § 1005(b)): Ok
Proper Address (CCP § 1013, § 1013a, § 1013b): Uncertain/Yes
– Plaintiff allegedly served this motion on Defendant, Beny Sarksian, via email
to Ben Gharagozli at lobgattorney@gmail.com and Kevin Hermansen at
kevinphermansen@gmail.com. The Court is not clear to who these two individuals
are. This motion was filed and allegedly served on 8/13/2024, and on 8/13/2024,
it appears as if Defendant Beny Sarksian’s counsel was Jay Stein. On eCourt,
Jay Stein has an email address listed of Jay@SteinLawyer.com. Therefore, Plaintiff
should be prepared to address who Ben and Kevin are. Further, this motion’s
proof of service does not allege proof of service on Defendant’s counsel, Jay
Stein. However, despite all this being said, it does in fact appear that Jay
Stein received this motion, because Jay Stein submitted an opposition to this
motion on 9/6/2024. It is also noted that on 9/13/2024, Jay Stein filed a
“Substitution of Attorney” indicating that Beny Sarksian is now representing
himself.

LEGAL STANDARD – COMPEL RESPONSES,
INSPECTION DEMANDS
Within
30 days after service of a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, the party to whom the demand is directed shall serve the original of
the response to it on the party making the demand, and a copy of the response
on all other parties who have appeared in the action, unless on motion of the
party making the demand, the court has shortened the time for response, or
unless on motion of the party to whom the demand has been directed, the court
has extended the time for response. (CCP §2031.260(a).)
If
a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the party making the demand
may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (CCP §2031.300(b).)
If
a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the party to whom the demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection
to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). (CCP
§2031.300(a).) “The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver
on its determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The
party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with
Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280. (2) The party’s
failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or
excusable neglect.” (CCP §2031.300(a)(1)-(2).)
Unlike
a motion to compel further responses, a motion to compel responses is not
subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding party does not have to
demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a “meet and confer”
requirement. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404 citing Weil and
Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group
2006) ¶¶8:1137 to 8:1144, pp. 8F-59 to 8F-60, ¶¶ 8:1483 to 8:1489, pp. 8H-29 to
hH-30 (Weil & Brown).)
TENTATIVE
RULING
Service
Proper
Address (CCP § 1013, § 1013a, § 1013b): Uncertain/Yes – Plaintiff allegedly
served this motion on Defendant, Beny Sarksian, via email to Ben Gharagozli at
lobgattorney@gmail.com and Kevin Hermansen at kevinphermansen@gmail.com. The
Court is unclear as to who these two individuals are. This motion was filed and
allegedly served on 8/13/2024, and on 8/13/2024, it appears as if Defendant
Beny Sarksian’s counsel was Jay Stein. On eCourt, Jay Stein has an email
address listed of Jay@SteinLawyer.com. Therefore, Plaintiff should be prepared to
address who Ben and Kevin are. Further, this motion’s proof of service does not
allege proof of service on Defendant’s counsel, Jay Stein. However, despite all
this being said, it does in fact appear that Jay Stein received this motion,
because Jay Stein submitted an opposition to this motion on 9/6/2024. It is
also noted that on 9/13/2024, Jay Stein filed a “Substitution of Attorney”
indicating that Defendant Beny Sarksian is now representing himself. 
Substantive
On
June 10, 2024, Plaintiff propounded on Defendant, Beny Sarksian, Demand to
Produce, Set Three. 
[Defendant’s
opposition indicates that the Demand to Produce is misnumbered as the third set
and should have been numbered as the fourth set. Plaintiff’s reply does not
address this issue. In any case, the Court notes that both parties appear to
agree that this motion pertains to the Demand to Produce that Plaintiff
propounded on Defendant Beny Sarksian on June 10, 2024.]
Both
parties agreed that the responses were due on July 15, 2024.
Both
parties agree that responses were not provided on the date in which responses
were due.
Further,
both parties appear to agree that responses have now been provided to the
instant discovery request. 
Therefore,
Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to Demand to Produce, Set Three, served
on June 10, 2024 is DENIED as moot because Defendant provided responses after
the filing of this motion.
Sanctions
In
relevant part, CCP § 2031.300(c) states as follows:
Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.
 
(CCP § 2031.300(c).)
 
“The
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
Plaintiff
requests the imposition of monetary sanctions against Beny Sarksian and his
attorney of record, Jay Stein, in the amount of $2,563.00 for the attorney fees
and costs incurred by Plaintiff in connection with this motion.
Plaintiff’s
counsel, Anahid Agemian, bases the request on: (1) An hourly rate of $500.00;
(2) 2.5 hours spent preparing the instant motion; (3) 2.5 hours reviewing the
opposition, preparing a reply, and attending the hearing on  the motion. 
Plaintiff
argues that sanctions are appropriate because responses were due on July 15,
2024, but no responses were provided by that due date. Plaintiff’s counsel also
points out that she contacted Defendant’s counsel to have the responses by July
19, 2024 to avoid court intervention. Plaintiff argues that at the August 7,
2024 IDC, Defendant’s counsel represented to the Court that compliance would be
no later than Monday, August  12, 2024. Plaintiff’s
counsel indicates that since she did not hear anything from Defendant or
receive responses by August 12, 2024, she filed the instant motion on August
13, 2024.
In
Opposition, Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s sanctions request should be
denied, and instead, monetary sanctions should be imposed against Anahid
Agemian, Plaintiff’s attorney, in at least the amount of $1,676.15.
In
Opposition, Defendant argues that at the August 7, 2024 IDC, Defendant’s
responses had been completed and were ready for transmittal, but Defendant’s
counsel was awaiting receipt of Defendant’s signed verification.
Defendant’s
opposition argues that upon the Court’s inquiry at the IDC as to if Defendant’s
counsel thought he could serve responses by August 12, 2024, Defendant’s
counsel thought that he could. Defendant’s counsel argues that there was
no court order that service of the responses occur by August 12, 2024, but that
it was defense counsel’s expression of belief that the service would occur by
that date.
Defendant’s
counsel states that on the evening of August 12, 2024, he received Sarksian’s
verification, and that upon arrival at the office on August 13, 2024, he sent
an email to Plaintiff’s counsel informing her that the verification had been
received and responses would be transmitted upon defense counsel’s return to
the office later in the afternoon.
Defendant
argues that Plaintiff did not conduct a meet and confer before filing this
motion and that Plaintiff should have checked with defense counsel before
filing the instant motion. Defendant argues that responses were delayed due to
Sarksian’s health impairments.
The
Court will hear argument.
The
Court is inclined to award sanctions, at least partially, as requested by
moving Plaintiff. 
As
a preliminary matter, neither Defendant’s opposition nor Defendant’s counsel’s
declaration explain how the health impairments of Defendant affected the
instant discovery. Close to zero information is provided with respect to the
health impairments issue affecting discovery.
When
Plaintiff filed this motion on August 13, 2024 at 8:24am, Plaintiff had not
received responses from Defendant. This is demonstrated from Exhibit A in the
Stein declaration wherein Defendant’s counsel indicates that verifications were
received and that responses will be sent later in the afternoon. Exhibit A
indicates that Defendant’s counsel’s email in Exhibit A was not sent until
August 13, 2024 at 10:18am. This email in Exhibit A would have been sent after
Plaintiff already filed this motion on August 13, 2024 at 8:24am.
Therefore,
when Plaintiff filed this motion, all Plaintiff would have known is that not
only were responses not provided by the initial deadline of July 15, 2024, but
responses were not provided by August 12, 2024 – the date when Defendant’s
counsel indicated at the IDC on August 7, 2024 that Defendant’s counsel thought
responses could be provided by. Further responses were not provided by when
Plaintiff filed this motion.
The
Opposition’s argument that Plaintiff had to meet and confer before filing this
motion is unavailing. There is no meet-and-confer requirement here when
compelling initial responses. 
Further,
in Reply, Plaintiff’s counsel notes that on September 3, 2024, she requested
that in exchange for withdrawing the instant motion, Defendant’s counsel would
withdraw the motion for protective order on calendar for 9/26/2024. However,
Plaintiff notes how Defendant’s counsel did not respond to this request.
