RELIEF REQUESTED 
“Defendant Glendale Unified School District, a public entity, will and hereby
does move for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to the provisions of Code of
Civil Procedure section 438, on the following grounds:
 
The Complaint for Damages does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Defendant
Glendale Unified School District. In this respect, the Complaint admits that
Plaintiff did not submit a pre-lawsuit tort claim to the District, such that
the District has remained immune from any claim Plaintiff may have wished to
make regarding alleged sexual abuse dating back almost 40 years. Plaintiff failed
to submit a claim in reliance on the unconstitutional act of the State
Legislature embodied in Assembly Bill No. 218 (2019-2020 Reg. Sess.) (“AB
218”), which retroactively abolished the requirement of providing written
notice of a claim necessary to overcome the sovereign immunity of the District.
AB 218 is unconstitutional because it allows Plaintiff and other claimants to
seek compensation from the District and other public entities without a legal
basis therefor, such that any sums that Plaintiff might receive would amount to
a gift of public funds in contravention of California Constitution Article XVI,
section 6. Plaintiff’s lawsuit should therefore be dismissed in its entirety as
seeking a gift of public funds in violation of the California Constitution.
 
Meet and Confer: The Court’s
attention is respectfully directed to the declaration of Nancy Doumanian that
is filed herewith pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 439, and
reflecting the meet and confer between counsel that preceded the filing of this
motion.
 
The motion will be based upon this
Notice, the accompanying Memorandum of Points and Authorities, the Declaration
of Nancy Doumanian, the evidentiary exhibits lodged and filed herewith, all
records and pleadings on file with this Court, all evidence of which the court
may take judicial notice, and such oral and documentary evidence as may be
presented at the hearing of this motion.”
 
(Def. Notice, p. i-ii.)
 
PROCEDURAL
Meet and Confer
Before
filing a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to this chapter, the
moving party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who
filed the pleading that is subject to the motion for judgment on the pleadings
for the purpose of determining if an agreement can be reached that resolves the
claims to be raised in the motion for judgment on the pleadings. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 439(a).) 
“A determination by the court that the meet and confer
process was insufficient shall not be grounds to grant or deny the motion for
judgment on the pleadings.” (CCP §439(a)(4).)
Here, Defendant’s counsel met and conferred. (See
Doumanian Decl. ¶¶ 1-3.)
LEGAL STANDARD – MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON
THE PLEADINGS
If
moving party is a defendant, a motion for judgment on the pleadings may be made
if either of the following conditions exist: (1) The court has no jurisdiction
of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the complaint, or (2) The
complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action
against the defendant. (CCP § 438(c)(1)(B).)
“The grounds for motion provided for in this section
shall appear on the face of the challenged pleading or from any matter of which
the court is required to take judicial notice. Where the motion is based on a
matter of which the court may take judicial notice pursuant to Section 452 or
453 of the Evidence Code, the matter shall be specified in the notice of
motion, or in the supporting points and authorities, except as the court may
otherwise permit.” (CCP § 438(d).)
“A motion for judgment on the pleadings may be made at
any time either prior to the trial or at the trial itself. [Citation.]” (Ion
Equipment Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 877.)  “A
motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general
demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings
or by matters that can be judicially noticed. Presentation of extrinsic
evidence is therefore not proper on a motion for judgment on the
pleadings.” (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 995, 999 (Citations Omitted).) The standard for ruling on a
motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as that applicable
to a general demurrer, that is, under the state of the pleadings, together with
matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. (Bezirdjian v. O'Reilly (2010)
183 Cal.App.4th 316, 321-322 (citing Schabarum v. California
Legislature (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216).)  
TENTATIVE
RULING
Plaintiff
filed the instant action on 9/26/2022 alleging causes of action for : (1)
Childhood Sexual Abuse, (2) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, (3)
Negligence Based on Government Code Sections 815.2 and 820, (4) Failure to
Report Suspected Child Abuse, (5) Negligent Supervision of a Minor, and (6)
Negligence.
Defendant
argues that Plaintiff’s entire lawsuit should be dismissed because AB 218 is
unconstitutional because it allows Plaintiff and other claimants to seek
compensation from the District and other public entities without a legal basis
therefor, such that any sums that Plaintiff might receive would amount to a
gift of public funds in contravention of California Constitution Article XVI,
section 6.
The Court
does not find Defendant’s argument availing.
Plaintiff’s
opposition directed the Court to the First District Court of Appeal’s ruling in
West Contra Costa Unified School District v. Superior Court of Contra Costa
County (2024) 103 Cal.App.5th 1243.
As stated
in the First District Court of Appeal’s ruling:
As
we explain, waiver of the claim presentation requirement did not constitute an
expenditure of public funds that may be considered a “gift” because AB 218 did
not create new “substantive liability” (Quigley, supra, 7
Cal.5th at p. 813, 249 Cal.Rptr.3d 548, 444 P.3d 688) for the underlying
alleged wrongful conduct. Instead, AB 218 simply waived a condition the state
had imposed on its consent to suit. (Quigley, at pp. 811–813, 249
Cal.Rptr.3d 548, 444 P.3d 688; Chapman v. State (1894) 104
Cal. 690, 697, 38 P. 457 (Chapman).)
(West
Contra Costa Unified School District v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (2024)
103 Cal.App.5th 1243, 323 Cal.Rptr. 3d 904, 913, review filed (Sept 9,
2024).)
Therefore,
in light of West Contra Costa Unified School District v. Superior Court of
Contra Costa County (2024) 103 Cal.App.5th 1243, Defendant’s motion for
judgment on the pleadings is DENIED. The Court notes that Defendant did not
file a Reply.
Defendant’s
requests for judicial notice are granted.
Plaintiff’s
request for judicial notice is granted.
