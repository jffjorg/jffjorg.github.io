Summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge is requesting further briefing from the parties on whether the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC) is bringing only a representative claim, and whether the Plaintiff can bring only a representative claim. The judge is confused about the Plaintiff's admission that the Representative Plaintiff is seeking representative PAGA penalties, attorneys' fees, and costs, and how this is not considered seeking redress for any of her individual claims. The judge is also questioning whether anyone can bring a representative claim without bringing an individual PAGA claim. The judge is ordering the parties to cite to specific paragraphs in the FAC and on-point legal authority to support their arguments.
