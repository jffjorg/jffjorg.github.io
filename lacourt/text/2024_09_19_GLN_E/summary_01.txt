And here is the summary in English:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the Defendant, Glendale Unified School District. The motion argues that the Plaintiff's lawsuit should be dismissed because the unconstitutional act of the State Legislature, embodied in Assembly Bill No. 218 (2019-2020 Reg. Sess.), allows the Plaintiff and other claimants to seek compensation from the District and other public entities without a legal basis therefor, thus amounting to a gift of public funds in contravention of California Constitution Article XVI, section 6. The Judge has denied the motion, citing the First District Court of Appeal's ruling in West Contra Costa Unified School District v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (2024) 103 Cal.App.5th 1243, which held that the waiver of the claim presentation requirement did not constitute an expenditure of public funds that may be considered a "gift."
