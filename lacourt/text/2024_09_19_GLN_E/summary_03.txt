And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to compel plaintiff's deposition and production of documents will be denied. The plaintiff, Ashleigh Soto, failed to appear for a deposition and did not meet and confer with the defendant, Kia America, Inc., on the deposition date. The defendant served a deposition notice and requested production of documents, but the plaintiff failed to respond. The plaintiff has since provided an alternative deposition date, but the defendant's motion does not address this. The Judge is inclined to deny the motion because the defendant did not meet the burden required for this type of motion, specifically failing to show good cause for the demands for production of documents. The Judge will hear argument before making a final ruling.
