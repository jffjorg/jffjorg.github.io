BACKGROUND
 
            On January 30, 2023, Plaintiff Tony
Curtis (“Plaintiff”) filed this product liability action against General Motors
LLC (“GM”) and Does 1 through 10 (collectively, Defendants”). 
 
Plaintiff
alleges the following: that he purchased a certified pre-owned 2021 GMC Sierra
(“Vehicle”) distributed and certified by GM. When Plaintiff purchased the
vehicle, he received written warranties and other express and implied
warranties that the Vehicle would be free from all defects in material and
workmanship and fit for the ordinary purposes for which it was intended.
Following taking possession, Plaintiff’s Vehicle began manifesting a number of
defects resulting in drive-train issues. The previous owner of the Vehicle
suffered from similar issues and traded-in the vehicle to an authorized GM
dealership. GM and its authorized dealership never repaired the issues and
instead processed the Vehicle through its CPO program and sold it to Plaintiff.
Plaintiff brought an action under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.
Defendant has refused to repurchase the Vehicle to date. 
 
            On July 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion. 
 
            As of January 29, 2024 at 8:06 am,
no opposition or reply papers were filed. 
            
LEGAL AUTHORITY
 
CCP §
2025.450(a) reads in relevant part:
 
If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action…, without having
served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.
 
The motion shall “(1) set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice” and “(2) be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition
and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or things
described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450(b)(2).) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff moves for an order
compelling the depositions of General Motors LLC’s person most knowledgeable.
Plaintiff further requests that this court order Defendant’s and their
attorneys of record to pay Plaintiff reasonable fees and expenses of $2,040.00.
 
            Here, Plaintiff provides
evidence that he noticed the deposition of General Motors, LLC’s Person Most
Knowledgeable regarding the subject vehicle on March 2, 2023. (Dec. Naderi ¶ 3;
Ex. A.) On April 11, 2023, Defendant served an objection to the noticed
deposition. (Id. at ¶ 4.) On June 22, 2023, Plaintiff reached out to get
alternative deposition dates. (Id. at ¶ 5.) Plaintiff did not receive a
response. (Id.) On July 6, 2023, Plaintiff again reached out to get
alternative dates and received no response. (Id. at ¶ 6.) On July 14,
2023, Plaintiff indicated that he needed alternative dates by July 17, 2023 or he
had no choice but to file a motion to compel. Again, Plaintiff received no
response. (Id. at ¶ 7.) As of the filing date of this motion, defense
counsel has not received deposition. (Id. at ¶ 8.) Plaintiff also
requests the deposition because it is “necessary
to understand what services and repairs were performed on the Vehicle.” (Mot.
to Compel Deposition p.4.) Also, the meet and confer requirement is likely
satisfied because Plaintiff sent three emails trying to set deposition dates to
no avail. (Id. at ¶¶ 5-7; Ex. B.)
 
            Thus, the Court GRANTS
the motion compelling the deposition of General Motors LLC’s person most
knowledgeable.
 
Monetary
Sanctions
 
A court shall impose monetary
sanctions in favor of the moving party if the motion to compel is granted,
unless “the one subject to sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code.
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450(g)(1).) 
 
Plaintiff has requested sanctions in the amount of $2,040.00
against Defendant GM and Defendant’s counsel. Plaintiff’s counsel’s billing
rate is $495.00 an hour. Plaintiff’s counsel spent 1 hour meeting and
conferring with defense counsel ($495.00); 1 hour researching and preparing the
motion ($495.00); anticipates spending 1 hour reviewing the opposition and
preparing the reply ($495.00); 1 hour to appear at the hearing ($495.00); and
filing fees in the amount of $60.00. (Dec. Naderi ¶ 9.)
 
            However, the Court finds
the requested amount is excessive. Accordingly, the monetary sanctions will be
reduced because the motion is straightforward and unopposed. Additionally, the
three emails to Defendant were short and brief which did not require a full
hour to meet and confer. Thus, the court GRANTS in a reduced amount the monetary
sanctions of $1,297.50 (2.5 hours total at a rate of $495 and the $60 filing
fee) against Defendant GM and its counsel. 
 
Conclusion 
 
The court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion compelling the deposition of General Motors
LLC’s person most knowledgeable.
 
Defendant’s person most knowledgeable is ORDERED to appear
for deposition, scheduled by Plaintiff within twenty-one (21) days of this
order. 
 
Defendant is ordered to pay Plaintiff $1,297.50 in
sanctions within thirty (30) days of this motion.
 
            Moving party is ordered
to give notice of ruling.
