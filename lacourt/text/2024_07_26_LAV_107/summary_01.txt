And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel in the motor vehicle negligence action brought by Plaintiff Edwin Morera against Defendant Elizabeth Hamilton, et al. The motion was unopposed and satisfied the procedural requirements, including service on the client and all parties. The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw and granted the motion as there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. The motion was made under California Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 1.16, citing a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship due to the client's conduct and a conflict of interest. The trial in this matter is set for November 20, 2024, and counsel is ordered to serve a copy of the order granting leave to withdraw on the client and all parties who have appeared in the action.
