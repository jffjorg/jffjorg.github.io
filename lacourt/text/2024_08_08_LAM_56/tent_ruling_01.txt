BACKGROUND
On
May 26, 2021, Plaintiff Precision General Contractors, Inc. dba Precision Water
&
Restoration (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint (“Complaint”) against Defendants, alleging a cause of action
for breach of contract.  The contract was
for Plaintiff, who was a general contractor, to provide abatement, mitigation
and construction services on Defendants’ home that had been damaged by water
intrusion following heavy winds that damaged the roof of the home.  On October 15, 2021, Defendants answered Plaintiff’s
Complaint, asserting a general denial and various affirmative defenses, and
also filed a cross-complaint (“Cross-Complaint”) against Plaintiff and its
owner Ivan Flores, which alleged eleven separate causes of action.
 
            A bench trial was conducted on
January 12 and 22, 2024.  Following trial
and submission of closing argument post-trial briefs, the Court issued its
Final Statement of Decision on June 3, 2024. 
On July 10, 2024, judgment was entered in favor of Defendants and
against Plaintiff on the Complaint, and on certain causes of action in the
Cross-Complaint.
 
            Defendants now file this motion
requesting an award of attorneys’ fees in the amount of $67,155 and costs in
the amount of $4,840.74 (the “Motion”).
             
DISCUSSION
Standard
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5(a)(10), a prevailing party may recover attorneys’ fees when authorized
by contract, statute, or law.  Civil Code
section 1717(a) provides “[i]n any action on a contract, where the contract
specifically provides that attorney's fees and costs, which are incurred to
enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the
prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing
on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or
not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees in addition to other
costs.” 
 
“The reasonableness of attorney fees is within the
discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a consideration of such
factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues, the
experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved.  The
court may also consider whether the amount requested is based upon unnecessary
or duplicative work.”  (Wilkerson v.
Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)  “The basis for the trial court's calculation
must be the actual hours counsel has devoted to the case, less those that
result from inefficient or duplicative use of time.”  (Horsford v. Board Of Trustees Of
California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 395.)  “The
law is clear, however, that an award of attorney fees may be based on counsel's
declarations, without production of detailed time records.”  (Raining Data Corp. v. Barrenechea
(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1375.) 
 
Analysis
In
the Court's Final Statement of Decision, the Court found that Defendants are
the prevailing party on both the Complaint and the Cross-Complaint, and that Defendants
were entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to a Motion for
Attorneys' Fees to be filed by Defendants. 
(Final Statement of Decision, ¶¶ 15-16.)
 
The
fee request is supported by attorney Lawrence Szabo's declaration, which
attaches a Schedule of Time and Charges (Exhibit 3) and a Memorandum of Costs
(Exhibit 4). (Declaration of Lawrence Szabo (“Szabo Decl.”), ¶¶ 4,7; Exhs. 3,
4.)  “The reasonable hourly rate is that
prevailing in the community for similar work.”  (PLCM Group v. Drexler
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)  “The
experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services
rendered in [her] court.”  (Ibid.)
 Szabo billed Defendants at $400.00 per hour,
which the Court finds to be a reasonable hourly rate in the Los Angeles area
for similar work.  In accordance with the Schedule of Time and
Charges, the total attorneys’ fees requested by Defendants is $63,560.  (Szabo Decl., ¶ 22; Exh. 3)  In addition, Defendants have incurred charges
in the amount of $2,995 for the preparation of this Motion, and declares an
anticipated amount of $600 in connection with the review of any opposition,
drafting of reply and appearance at the hearing for the Motion.  (Id., ¶ 23; Exh. 3.)  Pursuant to the Memorandum of Costs,
Defendants are also requesting an award of costs incurred in the amount of
$4,840.74.  (Id., ¶ 24; Exh. 4.)
 
The
court has reviewed the Schedule of Time and Charges submitted by Defendants and
finds the hours claimed reasonable considering the work performed and the needs
of the case. Since there was no opposition, however, the court strikes the
request for $600 representing anticipated charges in responding to an
opposition.
 
RULING
Accordingly,
Defendants’ Motion is GRANTED. The Court awards in favor of Defendant
attorneys’ fees of $66,555 and costs of $4,840.74, for a total amount of
$71,395.74. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
