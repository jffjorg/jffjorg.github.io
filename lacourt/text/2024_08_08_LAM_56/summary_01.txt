And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel plaintiff Isiah Dryer to provide further responses to defendant The Regents of the University of California's form interrogatories. The plaintiff filed a complaint alleging multiple causes of action under the Fair Employment and Housing Act, and the defendant served the form interrogatories in October 2023. The plaintiff responded with "boilerplate" objections and no verified responses, and then requested extensions to provide substantive responses. The defendant filed a motion to compel in March 2024, and the plaintiff filed an opposition in April 2024. The judge has granted the defendant's motion, finding that the defendant has met the good cause requirement to justify the plaintiff's further responses. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to provide complete, verified responses without further objections within 20 days of the date of the order. The judge has also denied the defendant's request for monetary sanctions against the plaintiff, finding that the plaintiff's lack of understanding of the discovery motion process was good cause for the denial.
