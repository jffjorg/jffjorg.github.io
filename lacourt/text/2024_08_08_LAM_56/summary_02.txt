Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, filed by the Defendant, The Regents of the University of California, and the opposition filed by the Plaintiff, Isiah Dryer. The Plaintiff has failed to provide substantive responses to the Form Interrogatories, despite multiple requests for extensions. The Court finds that the Defendant has met the good cause requirement to justify the Plaintiff's further responses. Therefore, the Court grants the Defendant's motion to compel the Plaintiff's further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One. The Court also denies the Defendant's request for monetary sanctions for this single occasion, due to the Plaintiff's lack of understanding of the discovery motion process.
