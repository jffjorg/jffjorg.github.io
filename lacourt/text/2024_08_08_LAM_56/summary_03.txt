And here is a brief English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, The Regents of the University of California, in their motion to compel the plaintiff, Isiah Dryer, to provide further responses to their form interrogatories. The judge found that the defendant had met the good cause requirement to justify the discovery sought, and that the plaintiff's failure to provide substantive responses despite repeated extensions was unreasonable. The judge also denied the defendant's request for monetary sanctions, citing the plaintiff's lack of understanding of the discovery process. The judge ordered the plaintiff to provide complete, verified responses without further objections within 20 days of the date of the order.
