Moving
Party to give notice. 
 
If a party
to whom interrogatories and document demands are directed fails to respond at
all, the propounding party’s remedy is to seek a court order compelling answers
thereto. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) All that needs to be shown is that the
discovery was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond
has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. The moving party
is not required to show a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the
matter informally before filing this motion. A motion to compel initial
discovery responses need not show good cause, meeting and conferring, or timely
filing, and need not be accompanied by a separate statement. (See Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) The failure to timely respond also waives all
objections. 
 
Here, Plaintiff
has shown that the discovery at issue were properly served onto Defendants
Fitness International, LLC and Sebastian Andres Reyes on December 12, 2023.  
 
In
Oppositions to these Motions, Defendants indicate that untimely responses were
served on April 1, 2024. Defendants’ Counsel states: “Unfortunately, due to an
internal error in Defendants’ counsel’s office, the response deadline was not
calendared and Defendants did not timely respond. I did not realize the error
until receipt of Plaintiff’s January 35, 2024 meet and confer correspondence.”
(David Decl., ¶3.) 
 
The Motions
are DENIED as MOOT. It is undisputed that untimely responses were served prior
to the date of this hearing. The only issue remaining is that of sanctions. 
Sanctions
may be awarded against a party who fails to oppose a motion to compel, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
after the motion was filed. (C.R.C 3.1348(a).). Reasonable sanctions are
awarded as indicated below:
Reasonable Sanctions
are GRANTED in the total amount for all six Motions to Compel, of $2,610.00.
Defendants FITNESS INTERNATIONAL, LLC, SEBASTIAN ANDRES REYES, and their
counsel of record are jointly and severally ORDERED to pay Moving Party and
their counsel of record sanctions in the total amount of $2,610.00 ($375.hr. x
6 hrs.) + ($60 filing fee x 6 motions), payable within 30 days from the date of
the Court’s issuance of this Order. This date may be extended by agreement of
the parties.
