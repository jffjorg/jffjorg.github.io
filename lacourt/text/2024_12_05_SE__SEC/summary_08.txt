And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's ex parte application to shorten the time to hear their motion to compel deposition. The plaintiff argued that they would suffer irreparable harm due to a delay in discovery, but the defendants opposed the motion, citing their timely service of objections to previous notices of depositions and their offer of alternative deposition dates in December 2024 and January 2025. The judge concluded that the plaintiff has not shown good cause warranting ex parte relief, and therefore denied the motion. The judge suggests that counsel may contact the court to inquire about the availability of an informal discovery conference if necessary.
