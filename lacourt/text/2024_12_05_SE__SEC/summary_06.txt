And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to compel responses from the Defendants, deeming it moot due to the untimely responses served by the Defendants. The Plaintiff had requested that the Judge compel the Defendants to respond to discovery requests, but the Judge found that the requests were properly served and the Defendants' failure to respond in a timely manner waived any objections.

The Judge also ordered the Defendants to pay sanctions to the Plaintiff in the amount of $2,610.00 for failing to oppose the motion to compel and for providing the requested discovery after the motion was filed. The sanctions are jointly and severally ordered against the Defendants, their counsel, and payable within 30 days.
