Interrogatories, Set One, are set to be heard on August 27, 2025, and September
2, 2025, respectively. Plaintiff now moves ex parte for an Order Shortening
Time for these hearings because they occur after the discovery cut-off date and
close to the trial date. In opposition, Defendants argue Plaintiff’s motions
are not warranted because Defendants provided timely, unverified responses.

hearings is GRANTED. Responses to form interrogatories and requests for
admission must be verified. (Code Civ. Proc. § § 2030.250; 2033.240.) The
