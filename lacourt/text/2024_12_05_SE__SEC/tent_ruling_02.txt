#1
 
P.
Ryan Banafshe and the Banafshe Law Firm, PC’s unopposed motion to withdraw as
counsel of record for Plaintiff Pablo Albarran is GRANTED.  
 
 
Moving
Party to give notice. 
 
No
Oppositions filed as of December 2, 2024.   
 
The
Court finds that Counsel has met the procedural requirements, including proper
notice to the client at the last known residence or business address of the
client.  C.R.C. 3.1362.
 
Here,
Counsel’s declaration indicates that there has been a breakdown of the
attorney-client relationship. Where the issue (or conflict) is between the
lawyer and client(s), without implicating other parties, the court can rely on
counsel’s sworn declaration absent any reason to doubt the representations. 
 
There
is an undisputed breakdown in attorney-client communications. It does not
appear that the Attorney Banafshe’s continued representation would serve the
interests of justice. The motion to withdraw is GRANTED.  
 
The
Court notes that there is a hearing for Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment
set for January 23, 2025, and trial is scheduled to begin on March 19, 2025.
