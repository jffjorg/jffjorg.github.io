And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of End of the Rose, LLC against Deinstitutionalized, LLC, et al. The case involves a dispute over a contract signed in 2016, in which the parties agreed to resolve any disputes through binding arbitration. The defendants have moved to compel arbitration, and the plaintiff has opposed the motion.

The judge has found that the arbitration provision in the contract is not procedurally unconscionable, meaning that it was not unfairly or coercively inserted into the contract. The judge has also found that the provision is substantively unconscionable, meaning that it reallocates the risks of the bargain in an objectively unreasonable or unexpected manner.

However, the judge has granted the motion to compel arbitration, compelling the 1st and 2nd causes of action (breach of contract and common counts) to arbitration. The 3rd cause of action (fraud) will be stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration.

The judge has also ordered that the arbitration shall take place through the American Arbitration Association, with the commercial rules applying to the dispute. A status conference is set for June 5, 2024, to discuss the status of the arbitration.
