Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to quash service of the summons and complaint filed by Academy Pointe, Inc. and J.K. Residential Services, Inc. The Court notes that the motions are taken off-calendar as moot in light of the updated proofs of service filed by the plaintiff on September 25, 2023. However, the Court grants the second motion to quash service of the summons and complaint filed on October 19, 2023, as Academy and JKR have shown that they were not properly served with the summons and complaint by personal service on September 21, 2023. The Court finds that the authorized agent, Luna Desai, does not exist and is not authorized to accept service on behalf of the companies. The Court orders that the second motion to quash is granted and that Defendants shall provide notice of this order. The Court encourages the parties to discuss service to determine what arrangements can be agreed on that will set a tone of civility for the litigation.
