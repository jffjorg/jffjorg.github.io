And here is a simple summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering a motion to quash service of summons and complaint filed by Flock Freight, Inc. The motion argues that the court lacks jurisdiction due to a pending federal court action involving the same parties and claims. The judge has denied the motion, finding that the court has personal and subject matter jurisdiction over the parties and claims in this action. The judge also notes that the federal court action has been dismissed, and there is no risk of conflicting judgments. The judge concludes that the motion is denied and orders Flock Freight, Inc. to provide notice of the order.
