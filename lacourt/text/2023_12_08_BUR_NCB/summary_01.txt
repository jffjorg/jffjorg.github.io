And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is on Lyft's motion for summary adjudication against Matthew Hinerfeld's causes of action for intentional and negligent misrepresentation. The motion is granted. Lyft argues that it did not make misrepresentations about its zero-tolerance policy, and that Mr. Hinerfeld did not rely on those representations. The Court finds that Lyft's statements about safety were opinion or puffery, common in advertisements, and not actionable representations for fraud claims. The Court also finds that Lyft's zero-tolerance policy is a requirement of the California Public Utilities Commission's Safety Requirement (d), and that Lyft has satisfied this requirement by including the policy on its website and mobile app. Therefore, the motion is granted, and the burden shifts to the plaintiff to raise triable issues of material fact.
