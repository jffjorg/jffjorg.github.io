Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants MBUSA's motion to compel arbitration and stay the action pending the outcome of the arbitration. The judge finds that the arbitration provision in the lease agreement is enforceable and that MBUSA is an intended third-party beneficiary of the agreement. The judge also applies the doctrine of equitable estoppel, finding that Plaintiffs are equitably estopped from contesting the arbitration agreement because their claims against MBUSA are intimately founded in and intertwined with the underlying Lease agreement. The judge orders the 1st to 4th causes of action alleged against MBUSA to be compelled to arbitration and stays the action pending the outcome of the arbitration.
