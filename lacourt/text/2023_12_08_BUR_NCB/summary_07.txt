This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a civil case between Natalie Ruxton (plaintiff) and Tyler Anne Smith (defendant) regarding a vehicle collision. The defendant has moved to strike the allegations for punitive damages from the plaintiff's complaint. The judge has denied the motion, ruling that the plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge found that the defendant's excessive drinking and reckless driving were sufficient to show a conscious disregard for the safety of others, which is a requirement for punitive damages.
