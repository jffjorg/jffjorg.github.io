And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the second and third causes of action in the complaint is sustained without leave to amend. The judge found that the complaint fails to state a valid cause of action for invasion of privacy and declaratory relief.

The judge ruled that the plaintiff's allegations of invasion of privacy are insufficient because the plaintiff consented to the defendant obtaining investigative consumer reports and did not show that the reports communicated private facts to the public. The judge also found that the plaintiff's expectation of privacy was not reasonable given their consent to the reports.

The judge also ruled that the plaintiff's claim for declaratory relief is insufficient because it is a prospective claim and does not state a present and actual controversy. The judge noted that the plaintiff is not a current tenant, but rather a prospective tenant, and that declaratory relief cannot be used to address past wrongs.
