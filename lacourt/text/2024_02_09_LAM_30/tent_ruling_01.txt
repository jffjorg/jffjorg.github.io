Piedmont Capital
Management, LLC vs. McElfish, et. al., Case No. 20STCV14138
 
Tentative Ruling
re:  Defendant’s Motion to Tax Costs
 
Defendant moves to strike the
Memorandum of Costs on Appeal filed by Plaintiff filed on December 18, 2023, or
in the alternative, tax the costs. The motion is denied. 
 
A prevailing party in litigation
may recover costs, including but not limited to filing fees. (Code of Civ.
Proc. §1033.5, subd. (a)(1).) Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5,
subdivision (c)(2), allowable costs are only recoverable if they are
“reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation.” Even mandatory costs,
when incurred unnecessarily, are subject to section 1033, subdivision (c)(2). (Perko’s Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS
Enterprises (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 245.) 
“‘[T]he trial court has no
discretion to deny prevailing party status to a litigant who falls within one
of the four statutory categories in the first [sentence] of the provision. “As
rewritten [in 1986], section 1032 now declares that costs are available as a
‘matter of right’ when the prevailing party is within one of the four
categories designated by statute.”’” (Charton v. Harkey, supra, 247
Cal.App.4th at p. 738.) 
 Cost may also be recovered on
appeal. According to Code of Civil Procedure § 1034(b), the Judicial Council
establishes the allowable costs on appeal and the procedure for recovering
these costs. Furthermore, California Rules of Court, rule 8.278, sets forth the procedural
mechanism for recovery of costs on appeal. 
 Any motion to strike or tax costs
must be served and filed 15 days after service of the memorandum, plus an
additional 5 days if served by mail or 2 days if served electronically. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, subd. (b)(1).) “Unless objection is made to the
entire cost memorandum, the motion to strike or tax costs must refer to each
item objected to by the same number and appear in the same order as the
corresponding cost item claimed on the memorandum of costs and must state why
the item is objectionable.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(b)(2).) 
Defendant
argues that Plaintiff’s costs are unreasonable, specifically as to item number
1, filing fees and item number 6, transmitting, filing, and serving of record,
briefs, and other papers. Defendant also states that Plaintiff’s failure to
attach receipts or documentation substantiating the requests for the costs
alleged makes it unable to assess whether the costs are allowable or reasonable
pursuant to California Rule of Court, rule 8.278(d). 
As to item
number 1, Defendant states that the California 2023 filing fee to file a Notice
of Appeal is $775.00. Plaintiff seeks recovery of $875.00 in filing fees. Defendant
states it is unclear whether the additional $100 Plaintiff alleges it incurred
was an allowable charge without invoices or receipts. Thus, Defendant requests
that the Court strike the request amount or tax in the amount of $100.
As to item
number 6, Plaintiff seeks $318.36 for transmitting, filing, and serving of
record, briefs, and other papers. Defendant states it is unclear whether the
amounts incurred were allowable costs and what specific amounts are being
charged without documents, invoices, or receipts. Thus, defendant requests that
the Court strike or tax this cost in the amount of $318.36.
In
opposition, Plaintiff states that a failure to attach receipts of documentation
does not bar recovery of costs; all that is required on a memorandum of costs
is: “The memorandum of costs must be verified by a statement of the party,
attorney, or agent that to the best of his or her knowledge the items of cost
are correct and were necessarily incurred in the case.” (California Rules of
Court Rule 3.1700(a)(1) [made applicable here by Rule 8.278(c)(1)]. 
As to the
$875.00 filing fees, Plaintiff states the $100 fee is mandated by Government
Code section 68926.1(a)(1), entitled “Deposit of fee upon filing notice of
appeal; additional fee” and states: “Upon filing a notice of appeal for which a
fee is paid pursuant to Section 68926, the appellant shall deposit the sum of
one hundred dollars ($100) with the clerk of the originating court. The deposit
shall be credited against the amount chargeable for the preparation of the
clerk's transcript or any other appeal processing or notification.” Although
ultimately applied to the costs of the clerk’s transcript, Plaintiff claims it
is initially categorized as a filing fee. 
As to the
$318.36 for the “transmitting, filing, and serving of record, briefs, and other
papers,” Plaintiff argues that Defendant fails to meet his burden in showing
that these costs are unreasonable or unnecessary as he simply argues that there
is no documentary support provided for these charges and fails to point to any
particular item or amount as being excessive or improper. Notwithstanding,
Plaintiff provides documentation of the payment of the $100 fee and of the
$318.36 charges. 
Defendant
provides no arguments in reply. 
The Court
finds that Plaintiff sufficiently shows that the items at issue are reasonable
and necessary. Plaintiff provides sufficient statutory authority for these
costs as allowable as well as providing documentation to support these costs.
The Court also agrees with Plaintiff  that
Defendant fails to meet his burden in showing the costs in number 6 are
unreasonable.
