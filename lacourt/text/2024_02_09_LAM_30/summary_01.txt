And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's memorandum of costs on appeal, or in the alternative, tax the costs. The plaintiff seeks to recover costs, including filing fees, and the defendant argues that certain costs are unreasonable. The judge finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently shown that the costs are reasonable and necessary, and provides statutory authority and documentation to support the costs. The judge also finds that the defendant has failed to meet his burden in showing that certain costs are unreasonable.
