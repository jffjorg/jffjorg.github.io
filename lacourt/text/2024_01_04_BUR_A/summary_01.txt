Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The defendants have demurred to certain causes of action and moved to strike others.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action as to Rami Grinwald without leave to amend. The judge has also sustained the demurrer to the fifth, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth causes of action with 20 days' leave to amend.

The judge has ruled that the litigation privilege bars certain causes of action. The judge has also found that the FAC does not state sufficient facts as to a violation of LAMC § 49.99.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the thirteenth cause of action with 20 days' leave to amend, finding that a landlord-tenant relationship, without more, does not create a fiduciary duty.

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to strike certain portions of the FAC that reference the unlawful detainer action, finding that the motion is moot given the sustaining of the demurrer to the causes of action that reference the eviction action.

The judge has also granted the defendants' motion to strike certain portions of the FAC that request punitive damages and attorneys' fees, finding that the motion is moot given the sustaining of the demurrer to the cause of action upon which these claims can be made with leave to amend.
