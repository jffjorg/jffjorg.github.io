BACKGROUND
 
            Petitioner
Andranik Movsisyan (“Petitioner” or “Movsisyan”) seeks leave to present a late
claim against Respondents County of Los Angeles and Cheryl Custard (“Custard”)
(collectively, “Respondents”), alleging liabilities for injuries sustained by
Petitioner on September 8, 2023.  
 
            On September
4, 2024, Petitioner filed the instant Petition for Leave to Present a Late
Claim (the “Petition”). Subsequently, Respondents filed their Opposition to the
Petition. No Reply papers have been received by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Government Code section 911.2(a) states that “a claim
relating to a cause of action for death or for injury to person or to personal
property . . . shall be presented . . . not later than six months after the
accrual of the cause of action.”  If
written notice of the board’s action or inaction (which amounts to a rejection)
on the claim is tendered pursuant to section 913, the claimant has six months
from the time the written notice is personally delivered or deposited in the
mail to file suit against the public entity. 
(Gov. Code § 945.6(a)(1).)
 
If a claimant fails to make a claim within six months
pursuant to Government Code section 911.2, the claimant may make a written
application to the board of the public entity for permission to present a late
claim within a reasonable time but not to exceed one year from the accrual of
the cause of action.  (Gov. Code §
911.4(a)-(b).)  If, pursuant to the
provisions of Government Code section 911.6, the board denies the application
to present a late claim, the claimant may petition the Court for relief from
the requirements of Government Code section 945.4.  (Gov. Code § 946.6(a).)
 
Government Code section 946.6(b) requires that the petition
to the court must show each of the following: (1) that the late claim
application made to the board was denied or deemed denied; (2) the reason for
failure to present the claim within six months of the accrual of the cause of
action; and (3) the contents of the claim as required by Government Code
section 910.  The petition must be filed
within six months after the application to present a late claim to the board
was denied or deemed to be denied.  (Ibid.)  
 
The Petitioner bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the late-claim application was made within a
reasonable time and that one of the statutory requirements under Government
Code section 946.6(c) was met.  (Drummond v. County of Fresno (1987) 193
Cal.App.3d 1406, 1410.)  
 
Under Section 946.6, relief may be granted when the
petitioner establishes that the failure to present the claim was through
mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect unless the public entity
establishes that it would be prejudiced in the defense of the claim if the
court relieves the petitioner from the claim filing requirements. (Barragan
v. County of Los Angeles (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1373, 1379-1380 quoting
Section 946.6, subd. (c)(1).)
 
Under section 946.4(e), the trial court must make its
determination upon the petition, “relying upon any affidavits in support of, or
in opposition to, the petition and any additional evidence received at hearing
on the petition.”  (Ebersol v. Cowan (1983) 35 Cal.3d 427, 431.)
 
“A copy of the petition and a written notice of the time and
place of hearing shall be served before the hearing as prescribed by
subdivision (b) of Section 1005 of the Code of Civil Procedure on (1) the clerk
or secretary or board of the local public entity, if the respondent is a local
public entity[...]” (Gov. Code ¶ 946.6(d).)
 
A.    Petition for Leave to Present a Late Claim
 
1)     
Accrual
of Petitioner’s Cause of Action
 
“As a general rule, a statute of limitations accrues when
the act occurs which gives rise to the claim . . . that is, when ‘the plaintiff
sustains actual and appreciable harm.’ 
Any ‘manifest and palpable’ injury will commence the statutory
period.”  (Costa Serena Owners Coalition v. Costa Serena Architectural Committee
(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1175, 1195-96.)  
 
Accordingly, Petitioner’s cause of action accrued on
September 8, 2023, when Petitioner sustained “the loss” (Pet. at p. 1) and
Custard provided her personal auto insurance to Petitioner. (Ibid.)
 
2)     
Petitioner’s
Fails to Meet the Burden of Proving One of the Statutory Requirements under
Government Code Section 946.6, subdivision (c)
 
Under Government Code section 946.6, subdivision (c), the court shall
relieve the petitioner from the requirements of Section 945.4 if the court
finds that the application to the board under Section 911.4 was made within a
reasonable time not to exceed that specified in subdivision (b) of Section
911.4 and was denied or deemed denied pursuant to Section 911.6 and that one or
more of the following is applicable:
 
(1)  
The failure to present
the claim was through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect
unless the public entity establishes that it would be prejudiced in the defense
of the claim if the court relieves the petitioner from the requirements of
Section 945.4. 
 
(Gov. Code, § 946.6, subd. (c).)
 
“Excusable neglect has been
defined as neglect that might have been the act or omission of a reasonably
prudent person under the same or similar circumstances.” (Munoz v. State of California (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1767,
1782.) It “is not shown by the mere failure to discover a fact until it is too
late; the party seeking relief must establish that in the exercise of reasonable
diligence, he failed to discover it.” (People ex rel. Dept. of
Transportation v. Superior Court (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 39, 44.) “The total
failure to investigate and take action to protect plaintiff’s rights was not
reasonable under the circumstances.” (Department of Water & Power v.
Superior Court (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1288, 1294.) A claimant is required to show that within the
statutory time period he “did not know or have reason to know”
that a government entity is involved. (Leake v. Wu (1976)
64 Cal.App.3d 668, 673.) (Italics in original.)
 
The Petitioner bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the late-claim application was made within a
reasonable time and that one of the statutory requirements under Government
Code section 946.6(c) was met.  (Drummond v. County of Fresno (1987) 193
Cal.App.3d 1406, 1410.) “The court shall make an independent
determination upon the petition.  The determination shall be made upon the
basis of the petition, any affidavits in support of or in opposition to the petition, and
any additional evidence received at the hearing on the petition.”  (Gov.
Code, § 946.6, subd. (e).)
 
Here, Petitioner claims that he initially filed a claim with
Respondent Custard’s personal auto insurer, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company,
and later was informed that Custard was driving during the scope of employment
and the claim was transferred to Carl Warren and Company Claims Management and
Solutions (“Carl Warren”), the insurance company for Custard’s employer. (Pet.
at p. 2.) Subsequently, Petitioner was informed by Carl Warren on March 5,
2024, that the claim needed to be filed with the Board of Supervisors due to
the fact that it was a county loss. (Ibid.) 
 
In the Opposition, Respondents argue that Petitioner has not provided
any evidence to support these claims, particularly regarding the timing of his
discovered that Custard was driving during the course and scope of her
employment, details of unspecified attempts to contact Carl Warren, or any
investigation on this information in pursuit of his claim. (Opp’n. at p. 5.)
They argue that Petitioner failed to make a diligent effort to pursue his claim
from the date of the incident until March 5, 2024. (Ibid.) 
            
The
Court notes that the Petitioner has not submitted affidavits or other evidence,
either attached to the Petition or separately filed, thereby failing to present
evidence to allow the Court to make an independent determination of any
statutory requirements for relief, pursuant to Government Code section 946.6,
subdivision (e). (See also Ganter v. Ganter (1952) 39 Cal.2d 272, 278 [The matters set forth in the memoranda of points
and authorities are not evidence and cannot provide the basis for the granting
of the motion. We do not consider evidence contained in documents filed here
which the parties failed to present as evidence to the trial court.])
 
Petitioner does not demonstrate that reasonable diligence was
exercised to investigate the County of Los Angeles’s potential liability and
claim requirement after being informed that Custard was driving within the
scope of employment. Additionally, Petitioner has not provided evidence of the filing
of the original claim that was allegedly not received by the Board of
Supervisors. Therefore, the Court finds that Petitioner has failed to meet
his burden of proving the existence of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect. (Gov. Code, § 946.6, subd. (c)(1).) These claims are
unsupported by evidence. By contrast, the Court finds Respondent’s argument
persuasive.
 
            Based on the foregoing, the Court
DENIES the Petition.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Petitioner
Andranik Movsisyan’s Petition for Leave to Present a
Late Claim is DENIED.
 
Petitioner to give notice.
