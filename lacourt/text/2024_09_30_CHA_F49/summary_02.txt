And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the Petition for Leave to Present a Late Claim filed by Andranik Movsisyan against the County of Los Angeles and Cheryl Custard. The Petitioner seeks to present a late claim for injuries sustained on September 8, 2023, and argues that he was unaware of the County's potential liability until March 5, 2024, when he was informed that Custard was driving during the scope of her employment.

However, the Court finds that the Petitioner has failed to meet his burden of proof, as he has not provided sufficient evidence to support his claims of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The Court notes that the Petitioner has not submitted affidavits or other evidence to support his claims, and that he has failed to demonstrate that he exercised reasonable diligence in investigating the County's potential liability.

Therefore, the Court denies the Petition, finding that the Petitioner has not established a basis for relief under Government Code section 946.6.
