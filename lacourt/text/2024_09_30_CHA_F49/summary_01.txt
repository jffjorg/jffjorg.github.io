And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to deem their requests for admission, set one, admitted. The defendants served the requests on March 6, 2024, and the plaintiff failed to serve timely responses. As a result, the plaintiff has waived any objections to the requests, including those based on privilege or the work product doctrine.

The judge has also granted the defendants' request for monetary sanctions, but only in part. The defendants incurred $420.00 in attorney's fees and costs in connection with the motion, and the judge has ordered the plaintiff to pay this amount within 20 days.
