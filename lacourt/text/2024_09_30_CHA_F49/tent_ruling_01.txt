BACKGROUND
 
This case arises from alleged injuries sustained by
Plaintiff from an automobile accident that occurred on February 24, 2021.
 
On February 23, 2023, Plaintiff Marvin Ernesto Bonilla
Martinez (“Plaintiff” or “Martinez”) filed the Complaint against Defendants
Madison Lenore Smith (“Smith”), Scott Halsey (“Halsey,” erroneously sued as
Halsey Scott) (collectively, “Defendants”), and Does 1 to 50, alleging two
causes of action: (1) Motor Vehicle Negligence, and (2) General Negligence. Subsequently,
on February 7, 2024, Defendants filed their Answer to the Complaint. 
 
On May 30, 2024, Defendants
filed the instant Motion to Deem the Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted
(the “Motion”). 
 
No Opposition or Reply papers
have been received by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by
a written request that any other party to the action admit the genuineness of
specified documents, or the truth of specified matters of fact, opinion
relating to fact, or application of law to fact. A request for admission may
relate to a matter that is in controversy between the parties.”¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.010.)¿ “Within 30 days after service of requests for admission,
the party to whom the requests are directed shall serve the original of the
response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the response on all
other parties who have appeared ....”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd.
(a).)¿
 
If a party to whom request for
admissions is served fails to provide a timely response, the party to whom the
request was directed waives any objections, including based on privilege or the
work product doctrine. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) The requesting
party can move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted, as well as for
monetary sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) The court shall
issue this order unless the party to whom the request was made serves a
response in substantial compliance prior to the hearing on the motion. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)¿
 
A.   
Motion to Deem
Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted
 
Defendants’ counsel, David
J. Mendoza (“Mendoza”), attests that on March 6, 2024, Plaintiff was served
with the first set of Requests for Admission by email, establishing that
responses were due on April 9, 2024. (Mendoza Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. “2.”) No responses
were received by the established due date. (Id. ¶ 4.) On May 1, 2024,
Mendoza’s office emailed Plaintiff’s counsel, advising that no responses had
been received and requesting that Plaintiff serve responses, without objection,
by May 6, 2024. (Id. ¶ 5, Ex. “B.”) However, as of the date of filing of
the Motion, Plaintiff has not served any responses. (Id. ¶ 6.) 
 
Based on the above records,
the Court determines that Plaintiff failed to serve a timely response, thereby
waiving any objection to the interrogatories, including those based on
privilege or the protection for work product, pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (a). 
 
Nevertheless, under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (a), the court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response
that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and
2033.230. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the
result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
 
Here,
Plaintiff did not file an Opposition to the Motion. Nor did Plaintiff move
separately for relief from the waiver. Additionally, there is no record
indicating any responses have been subsequently served by Plaintiff prior to
the hearing. Consequently, the Court finds that relief under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.280 is unavailable in this circumstance.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the Motion, deeming
the Requests for Admission, Set One, served by Defendants on March 6, 2024,
admitted.
 
A.   
Monetary
Sanctions
 
“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or
both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
The Court finds the mandatory sanction
applies in this case and it determines the total and reasonable amount of
attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with
the Motion to be $420.00, calculated based on a reasonable hourly rate of $180.00
for 2 hours reasonably spent, plus a $60.00 filing fee.
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS IN PART Defendants’ request for
monetary sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendants Madison Lenore Smith and Scott Halsey’s unopposed Motion
to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted is GRANTED.
 
Defendants
Madison Lenore Smith and Scott Halsey’s
Request
for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART. 
 
Plaintiff
Marvin Ernesto Bonilla Martinez and his attorney of record are ordered to
jointly and severally pay $420.00 to Defendants within 20 days.
