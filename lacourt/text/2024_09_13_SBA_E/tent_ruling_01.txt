BACKGROUND
On December 22, 2022, Plaintiff Enrique
Olvera-Conde filed a complaint against Defendants Nissan of South Bay, LLC; KKT
Automotive, LLC; Alberto Torres Ibarra, alleging negligence. Plaintiff alleges
that on or about September 27, 2021, he was traveling in a vehicle Northbound
along Western Avenue, approaching the intersection of Torrance Boulevard, in
the City of Torrance, County of Los Angeles when Defendant Ibarra struck
Plaintiff’s vehicle from behind. 
 
On
March 7, 2023, Plaintiff Bertha Carrillo filed a complaint against the same
defendants for negligence, in case number 23TRCV00665. The cases were related
on April 26, 2023. Carrillo alleges that on or about September 27, 2021, he was
a passenger in a Lyft vehicle, traveling on Western Avenue and had come to a
safe stop at a red light on Torrance Boulevard, when the vehicle owned by
Defendant KKT Automotive rear-ended the Lyft vehicle.
 
On
July 26, 2024, Defendants filed the instant motions to compel the person most
knowledgeable of non-party witness California Sports & Spine Center and
Baseline Diagnostics.
 
To
date, no opposition has been filed.
 
Trial
is set for April 29, 2025. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
“Unless otherwise limited by order of the
court …, any party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged,
that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action or to the
determination of any motion made in that action, if the matter either is itself
admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.)
 
“In California, discovery may be obtained from
a nonparty through an oral deposition, a written deposition, or a deposition
for the production of business records and things.” (Board of Registered
Nursing v. Superior Court of Orange County (2021) 59 Cal.App.5th 1011, 1030
(“Board”).)
 
To pursue the deposition of a nonparty, a
party must generally serve a deposition subpoena. [Citation.] ‘A deposition
subpoena that commands only the production of business records for copying
shall designate the business records to be produced either by specifically
describing each individual item or by reasonably particularizing each category
of item, and shall specify the form in which any electronically stored
information is to be produced, if a particular form is desired.’ [Citations.]”
(Board, supra, 59 Cal.App.5th at p. 1030.)
 
“If a deponent fails to answer any question or
to produce any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing
under the deponent’s control that is specified in the deposition notice or a
deposition subpoena, the party seeking discovery may move the court for an
order compelling that answer or production.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480,
subd. (a).)
 
The moving party must “set forth specific
facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.220, subd. (b)(1).)
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Baseline
Diagnostics
 
            On a preliminary note, the Court points out that there
are two motions with different reservation IDs to compel compliance with
deposition subpoena as to Baseline Diagnostics. However, upon review of the
requests and motions. Thus, the ruling applies to both motions. 
 
1.     Service of the Moving Papers on Nonparty
Deponent
 
Under California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1346: “A written notice and all moving papers supporting
a motion to compel an answer to a deposition question or to compel production
of a document or tangible thing from a nonparty deponent must be personally served
on the nonparty deponent unless the nonparty deponent agrees to accept service
by mail or electronic service at an address or electronic service address
specified on the deposition record.”  
 
Here, Defendants
served Baseline Diagnostics by personal service. (Mot POS 7/25/24.) 
 
Thus, the Court
finds service to be proper.
 
2.     Timeliness
 
A “motion [to
compel compliance with a deposition notice] shall be made no later than 60 days
after the completion of the record of the deposition ….” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.480, subd. (b); see Unzipped Apparel, LLC v. Bader (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th
123, 136 [holding with regards to the production of business records pursuant
to a deposition subpoena, “[t]he record [is] complete as of the date set for
the production …”]; Board, supra, 59 Cal.App.5th at p. 1033 [“The nonparty’s
compliance with the subpoena is clear on the date specified for production. It
has either produced documents as requested in the subpoena, or not. On that
date, the subpoenaing party has all of the information it needs to meet and
confer regarding the nonparty's compliance and, if unsatisfied, prepare a
motion to compel”].)  
 
Here, the
deposition subpoena at issue requested Baseline Diagnostics to produce the
documents in the subpoena by May 28, 2024. (Charboneau Decl. ¶ 3.)
 
Defendants filed
this motion on July 26, 2024, within 60 days of April 30, 2024, the date set
for the production of documents.  
 
Accordingly, the
Court finds the motion timely.  
 
3.     Meet and Confer
 
A motion to compel
compliance with a deposition notice “shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd.
(b).)  
 
Defendants’ counsel
states that despite multiple attempts to contact Baseline Diagnostics and
reschedule the deposition, including calls and voicemails on May 23, 2024, and
June 4, 2024, Baseline Diagnostics did not respond or comply with the subpoena.
Subsequent efforts to meet and confer were also unsuccessful. (Charboneau Decl.
¶¶ 3, 5, 7-8.). The Court finds that defense counsel’s declaration satisfies
the meet and confer requirement. 
 
4.     Separate Statement
 
Under California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345, a motion to compel answers at a deposition or the
production of documents or tangible things at a deposition must be accompanied
by a separate statement. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a)(4)-(5).)  
 
Here, Defendants have
filed and served a separate document “provid[ing] all the information necessary
to understand each discovery request and all the responses to it that are at
issue.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(c).) 

 
Accordingly, the
Court finds that Defendants have satisfied the separate statement
requirement.  
 
5.     The Deposition Subpoena at Issue
 
The subpoena
requests the following: 
 
1. Produce all
correspondence to and from JACOBY & MEYERS ATTORNEYS LLP concerning BERTHA
CARILLO (DOB 02/12/1964).
 
2. Produce all lien
agreements for services provided to BERTHA CARILLO (DOB 02/12/1964) at BASELINE
DIAGNOSTICS. 
 
3. Produce all
BASELINE DIAGNOSTICS bills for all neuromonitoring for anterior cervical
discectomy and fusion surgeries performed in July 2023 (this is not limited to
BERTHA CARILLO (DOB 02/12/1964)). 
 
4. Produce a record
of the payments received by BASELINE DIAGNOSTICS for the procedures identified
in request number 3. 
 
5. Produce any
FACTORING AGREEMENTS entered into by BASELINE DIAGNOSTICS and any person or
company concerning BERTHA CARILLO (DOB 02/12/1964). (“FACTORING AGREEMENTS” are
agreements where a medical provider sold its accounts receivable for a patient
to another company.) 
 
6. Any LITIGATION
FUNDING COMPANY agreements with BERTHA CARILLO (DOB 02/12/1964) in your custody
and control. (A “LITIGATION FUNDING COMPANY” is a company that pays money,
either to a healthcare provider or a plaintiff, in return for an agreement by
the plaintiff to either pay interest on the payment or a percentage of any
recovery.) 
 
7. All documents
demonstrating that any person or company has purchased an account receivable
from BASELINE DIAGNOSTICS for treatment provided to BERTHA CARILLO (DOB
02/12/1964). 
 
8. Any and all
documents demonstrating that BASELINE DIAGNOSTICS has sold an account
receivable to any person or company for treatment related to BERTHA CARILLO
(DOB 02/12/1964). 
 
9. Any contract or
document signed by BERTHA CARILLO (DOB 02/12/1964), including any agreement
whereby BERTHA CARILLO (DOB 02/12/1964) waived the right to use medical
insurance. 
 
10. Produce your
entire file relating to BERTHA CARILLO (DOB 02/12/1964).
 
Defendants argue
that the testimony and records from Baseline Diagnostics are highly relevant to
the case. They argue that the records are necessary to evaluate the costs of
Plaintiff’s medical treatment, particularly the $26,000 fee for
neuromonitoring, and to defend against Plaintiff’s claims. The requested
information is crucial to address issues related to causation, damages, and the
valuation of Plaintiff’s claims. Without this deposition, Defendants risk
unfair surprise at trial. (Charboneau Decl. ¶¶ 3, 8).
 
“Personal service
of any deposition subpoena is effective to require all of the following of any
deponent who is a resident of California at the time of service: ¶ (1) Personal
attendance and testimony, if the subpoena so specifies. ¶ (2) Any specified production,
inspection, testing, and sampling.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.220, subd.
(c).)  
 
Here, Defendants have
submitted a proof of service indicating that Baseline Diagnostics was personally
served with the Subpoena on April 17, 2024. (Charboneau Decl. ¶ 3, Exh. B.) 
 
Therefore, upon
personal service of the Subpoena, Baseline Diagnostics was required to produce
any specified production of documents in the Subpoena on the date set for
production.  
 
            Baseline Diagnostics provides no opposition. 
 
Thus, the Court
GRANTS Defendants’ request for an order compelling Baseline Diagnostics to
produce the documents requested in the Subpoena within 20 days of the Court’s
Order.  
 
California Sports
& Spine Center
 
            On a preliminary note, the Court points out that there
are two motions with different reservation IDs to compel compliance with
deposition subpoena as to California Sports & Spine Center. However, upon
review of the requests and motions. Thus, the ruling applies to both motions. 
 
1.     Service of the Moving Papers on Nonparty
Deponent
 
Under California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1346: “A written notice and all moving papers supporting
a motion to compel an answer to a deposition question or to compel production
of a document or tangible thing from a nonparty deponent must be personally served
on the nonparty deponent unless the nonparty deponent agrees to accept service
by mail or electronic service at an address or electronic service address
specified on the deposition record.”  
 
Here, Defendants
served California Sports & Spine Center by personal service. (Mot POS
7/25/24.)
 
Thus, the Court
finds service to be proper.
 
2.     Timeliness
 
A “motion [to
compel compliance with a deposition notice] shall be made no later than 60 days
after the completion of the record of the deposition ….” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.480, subd. (b); see Unzipped Apparel, LLC v. Bader (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th
123, 136 [holding with regards to the production of business records pursuant
to a deposition subpoena, “[t]he record [is] complete as of the date set for
the production …”]; Board, supra, 59 Cal.App.5th at p. 1033 [“The nonparty’s

has either produced documents as requested in the subpoena, or not. On that
date, the subpoenaing party has all of the information it needs to meet and
confer regarding the nonparty's compliance and, if unsatisfied, prepare a
motion to compel”].)  
 
Here, the
deposition subpoena at issue requested California Sports & Spine Center to
produce the documents in the subpoena by May 28, 2024. (Charboneau Decl. ¶ 3.)
 
Defendants filed
this motion on July 26, 2024, within 60 days of April 30, 2024, the date set
for the production of documents.  
 
Accordingly, the
Court finds the motion timely.  
 
3.     Meet and Confer
 
A motion to compel
compliance with a deposition notice “shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd.

Defendants’ counsel
states that despite multiple attempts to contact California Sports & Spine
Center and reschedule the deposition, including calls and voicemails on May 23,
2024, and June 4, 2024, Baseline Diagnostics did not respond or comply with the
subpoena. Subsequent efforts to meet and confer were also unsuccessful.
(Charboneau Decl. ¶¶ 3, 5, 7-8.). The Court finds that defense counsel’s
declaration satisfies the meet and confer requirement. 
 
4.     Separate Statement
 
Under California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345, a motion to compel answers at a deposition or the
production of documents or tangible things at a deposition must be accompanied
by a separate statement. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a)(4)-(5).)  
 
Here, Defendants
have filed and served a separate document “provid[ing] all the information
necessary to understand each discovery request and all the responses to it that
are at issue.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(c).)  
 
Accordingly, the
Court finds that Defendants have satisfied the separate statement
requirement.

entire file relating to BERTHA CARILLO (DOB 02/12/1964). 02/12/1964).
(“FACTORING AGREEMENTS” are agreements where a medical provider sold its
accounts receivable for a patient to another company.) 
 
Defendants argue
that the requested testimony and records from California Sports & Spine
Center are highly relevant to their defense against Plaintiffs’ claims. During
discovery, it was found that Plaintiff Olvera-Conde underwent significant
treatments, including L4-S1 epidural injections, C7-T1 epidural injections, and
L3-L5 lumbar medial branch blocks, with total costs exceeding $49,900.
Similarly, Plaintiff Carrillo received treatments, including C7-T1 interlaminar
epidural steroid injections and additional injections, costing over $28,700.
Defendants contend that these costs are unreasonable and seek documents and
testimony to determine fair valuation, including acceptable payments and
potential litigation funding related to Plaintiffs’ treatments. Defendants
argue that the records and testimony are crucial for evaluating damages,
causation, and other issues pertinent to the case. Defendants argue that
without the deposition of California Sports & Spine Center, they risk being
unfairly surprised at trial. Therefore, they request a court order compelling
California Sports & Spine Center's compliance to allow proper trial
preparation. (Charboneau Decl. ¶¶ 3, 8.)
 
“Personal service
of any deposition subpoena is effective to require all of the following of any
deponent who is a resident of California at the time of service: ¶ (1) Personal
attendance and testimony, if the subpoena so specifies. ¶ (2) Any specified production,
inspection, testing, and sampling.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.220, subd.
(c).)  
 
Here, Defendants
have submitted a proof of service indicating that California Sports & Spine
Center was personally served with the Subpoena on April 17, 2024. (Charboneau
Decl. ¶ 3, Exh. B.) 
 
Therefore, upon
personal service of the Subpoena, California Sports & Spine Center was
required to produce any specified production of documents in the Subpoena on
the date set for production.  
 
            Baseline California Sports & Spine Center provides no
opposition. 
 
Thus, the Court
GRANTS Defendants’ request for an order compelling California Sports &
Spine Center to produce the documents requested in the Subpoena within 20 days
of the Court’s Order.  
 
Sanctions
 
A court may impose
reasonable monetary sanctions on a nonparty for failure to comply with a
subpoena. (Cf. Terry v. SLICO (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 352, 359 [“[S]ince
service of the deposition subpoena on Pimentel [a nonparty witness] was
effective despite the absence of a supporting affidavit or declaration [of good
cause], the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing reasonable
monetary sanctions for his failure to comply with the subpoena”].)  
 
Here, Defendants
seek sanctions of $1,290 against Baseline Diagnostics and California Sports
& Spine Center for each motion, which consists of $205 hourly rate for 6
hours, consisting of .25 hours drafting meet and confer correspondence, 2.75
hours for drafting the motion, .5 hours for reviewing and analyzing any
opposition, 1 hour for drafting reply, and 1.5 hours to attend hearing.
Defendants also request the $60 filing fee. 
 
The Court finds the
hourly rate to be reasonable but reduces the total number of hours to 2.5 (1.5
hours to draft motion and 1 hour to attend hearing). Given the duplicity of the
motions for Baseline Diagnostics and California Sports & Spine Center, the
Court will only award these sanctions for two motions. 
 
Thus, the Court
awards Defendants sanctions in the amount of ($205 x 2.5 hours) + ($60) =
572.50 as to Baseline Diagnostics and California Sports & Spine Center each
to be paid within 20 days of this Court’s order.
