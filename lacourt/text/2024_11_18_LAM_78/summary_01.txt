And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to enforce a settlement agreement between the plaintiffs and defendants. The plaintiffs alleged that the parties had reached a settlement agreement and that the defendants had breached the agreement by failing to pay the settlement sum. The defendants argued that the settlement agreement was never finalized and that they did not sign the agreement. The judge found that the plaintiffs had not met the strict statutory requirements for enforcing a settlement agreement under CCP § 664.6, as the defendants did not sign the agreement. Therefore, the motion to enforce the settlement is denied.
