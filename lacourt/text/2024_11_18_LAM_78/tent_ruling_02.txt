 Case Number:  24STCV09615    Hearing Date:   November 18, 2024    Dept:  78  Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78 ¿ DIANIRES MAJANO, et al., Plaintiff(s), vs. BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., et al., Defendant(s). Case No.: 24STCV09615 Hearing Date: November 18, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING DEMURRER TO COMPLAINT WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND  I. BACKGROUND Plaintiff Dianires Majano, both in an individual capacity and as Attorney-in-Fact to Rudy Majano, (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action against defendants Bank of America, N.A. (“BANA”), Clear Recon Corp., and Does 1 through 50 pertaining to the sale of real property commonly described as 1245 W. 39th Street Los Angeles CA 90037 (“the Property”). The complaint sets forth four causes of action against all defendants for (1) Wrongful Foreclosure, (2) Violation of Homeowner Bill of Rights (“HBOR”), (3) Conversion, and (4) Monies Had and Received. On June 27, 2024, defendant BANA filed the instant demurrer against Plaintiffs’ complaint. On September 19, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an opposition.  On September 23, 2024, due to the late opposition, the Court continued the hearing to allow BANA the opportunity to file a reply brief. The reply was due no later than five court days prior to the continued hearing date of November 18, 2024. On November 8, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a reply.  II. PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENT Before filing a demurrer, the demurring party is required to meet and confer with the party who filed the pleading demurred to for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer. (CCP § 430.41(a).) BANA’s counsel declares he made multiple attempts to call Plaintiffs’ counsel and to schedule a time to discuss the demurrer. (Decl. Lapidus, ¶¶ 4-8.) To date, Plaintiffs’ counsel has not responded. (Id. ¶ 8.) The Court finds BANA fulfilled the meet and confer requirement prior to filing the demurrer.  III. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE BANA requests the Court to take judicial notice of (1) The Deed of Trust recorded in the Los Angeles County Official Records on July 1, 1999, as Document No. 99-1204359, (2) The Deed of Trust recorded in the Los Angeles County Official Records on December 31, 2003, as Document No. 03-3923576, (3) The Deed of Trust recorded in the Los Angeles County Official Records on December 13, 2005, as Document No. 05-3066600, (4) The Modification of Security Instrument recorded in the Los Angeles County Official Records on August 13, 2007, as Document No. 20071899087, (5) The Deed of Trust recorded in the Los Angeles County Official Records on May 1, 2013, as Document No. 20130655967, (6) The Substitution of Trustee and Full Reconveyance recorded in the Los Angeles County Official Records on April 16, 2013, as Document No. 20130561191, (7) The Subordination Agreement recorded in the Los Angeles County Official Records on July 31, 2013, as Document No. 20131127977, (8) The Notice of Default recorded in the Los Angeles County Official Records on November 13, 2023, as Document No. 20230778369, (9) The Notice of Trustee’s Sale recorded in the Los Angeles County Official Records on February 26, 2024, as Document No. 20240121907, (10) The Fannie Mae Loan Modification Agreement recorded in the Los Angeles County Official Records on March 5. 2024, as Document No. 20240142661, and (11) The Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale recorded in the Los Angeles County Official Records on May 15, 2024, as Document No. 20240320051. Requests 1 through 11 are GRANTED. (Cal. Evid. Code § 452(d), (h).) The court “may take judicial notice of the fact of a document’s recordation, the date the document was recorded and executed, the parties to the transaction reflected in a recorded document, and the document’s legally operative language….¿ From this, the court may deduce and rely upon the legal effect of the recorded document, when that effect is clear from its face.” (Fontenot v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 256, 265, disapproved on other grounds by Yvanova v. New Century Mortg. Corp. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 919, 939.)  IV. LEGAL STANDARD A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732 (internal citations omitted).)  V. DISCUSSION BANA demurs on the grounds that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute each cause of action against it. First & Second C/As: Wrongful Foreclosure/Violation of HBOR BANA avers that the gravamen of Plaintiffs’ wrongful foreclosure claim is the alleged failure to comply with HBOR. However, BANA contends that the judicially noticed documents demonstrated that HBOR does not apply, because the loan foreclosed upon was a second position lien, not first position lien as erroneously alleged in the complaint. BANA argues that except for alleged violations of HBOR, which is not applicable, the complaint fails to state sufficient facts that the subject foreclosure was illegal, fraudulent or oppressive. In opposition, Plaintiffs argue that that the Note was subordinated to the first position. Plaintiffs also contend that they have articulated the necessary elements of wrongful foreclosure at paragraphs 48-54, and that the heart of the matter is that Plaintiffs did not owe BANA any money. In reply, BANA argues that the judicially noticed subordination agreement provides that the deed of trust recorded on December 13, 2005 was subordinated to the deed of trust recorded on May 1, 2013, such that the Subject Loan is a second position lien. Here, the complaint alleges that the subject loan with BANA was a “first Deed of Trust” and that Plaintiffs are therefore both eligible for protections under HBOR. (Compl. ¶ 23.) Plaintiffs allege they were not contacted in person or by telephone to explore options for avoiding foreclosure as mandated by HBOR (Compl. ¶ 15), and that the failure to comply with obligations under HBOR “forms the gravamen of a cause for action for wrongful disclosure and to set aside any foreclosure Deed” (Compl. ¶ 16).  The judicially noticed documents demonstrate that the referenced loan was not the first lien mortgage or deed of trust for HBOR to be applicable. (See Civil Code, § 2924.15 (HBOR provisions “shall apply only to a first lien mortgage or deed of trust”). “[A] pleading valid on its face may nevertheless be subject to demurrer when matters judicially noticed by the court render the complaint meritless.” (Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal. App. 3d 593, 604.) Further, the heart of this matter, based on the pleading, does not appear to be that Plaintiffs did not owe BANA any money as Plaintiffs’ contend. Rather, the complaint itself specifically premises the wrongful disclosure claim on the applicability of HBOR (See Compl. at ¶ 17 [“California Homeowner Bill of Rights and California Civil Code §2923.5 forms the gravamen of a cause of action for wrongful foreclosure and to set aside any Foreclosure Deed, and the availability of a private right of action predicated on a violation of §2923.5.”], and there are only general allegations of the improper sale of the Property by defendants that was illegal, fraudulent, willful, and oppressive (Compl. ¶¶ 48-53). Plaintiffs assert that the Note was subordinated to the first position for HBOR to apply, but do not provide any judicially noticeable documents to contest BANA’s judicially noticed evidence. Further, a mere recitation of the elements of wrongful foreclosure without any specific facts pled in support thereof is insufficient to maintain a wrongful foreclosure claim. For the same reasons, the second cause of action for violation of HBOR must also fail. BANA’s demurrer to the first and second causes of action are therefore SUSTAINED. Third & Fourth C/As: Conversion/Monies Had and Received Plaintiffs aver that they do not oppose the demurrer to the third and fourth causes of action. Plaintiffs represent that they were able to reach a resolution of the Excess Surplus Proceeds with Clear Recon Corp., and that therefore the issue regarding Excess Surplus Proceeds is moot. The demurrer to the third and fourth causes of action will therefore be SUSTAINED without leave to amend.  VI. CONCLUSION The burden is on the complainant to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully, in order to obtain an order allowing leave to amend. (McKenney v. Purepac Pharmaceutical Co.  (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 72, 78.) Plaintiffs request generally that they should be given leave to amend. However, the burden is on the complainant to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully, in order to obtain an order allowing leave to amend.  (McKenney v. Purepac Pharmaceutical Co.  (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 72, 78.) Plaintiffs have not articulated how, based on the judicially noticed evidence, the allegations can be amended for Plaintiffs to be able to assert claims under HBOR that forms the gravamen of both the first and second causes of action, nor do they present any specific facts to support the elements for wrongful foreclosure. Therefore, the demurrer to the first and second causes of action against BANA are SUSTAINED without leave to amend. The demurrer to the third and fourth causes of action are SUSTAINED without leave to amend on the grounds of mootness.  Moving Party is ordered to give notice.  DATED: November 15, 2024 __________________________ Hon.
