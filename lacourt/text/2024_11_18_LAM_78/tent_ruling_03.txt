 Case Number:  24STCV13795    Hearing Date:   November 18, 2024    Dept:  78  Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78 ¿ 2640 DALTON AVE 2, LLC, Plaintiff(s), vs. CARLOS RODRIGUEZ, et al., Defendant(s). Case No.: 24STCV13795 Hearing Date: November 18, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  I. BACKGROUND Plaintiff 2640 Dalton Ave 2, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed this unlawful detainer action against defendants Carlos Rodriguez, Marta Rodriguez, and Does 1 to 10 for possession of residential property located at 2640 Dalton Ave., Unit 8, Los Angeles, CA 90018 (“Subject Property”) pursuant to a written lease agreement (“Lease”).¿The action is solely for nonpayment of rent.  On June 17, 2024, defendant Marta Rodriguez filed an Answer to the complaint. On August 23, 2024, default was entered against defendant Carlos Rodriguez. On October 9, 2024, defendant Marta Rodriguez (“Defendant”) filed the instant motion summary judgment on the grounds that the predicate Notices to Pay Rent or Quit were defective because they overstated the amount of rent owed by Defendant. On November 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On November 12, 2024, Defendant filed a reply.  II. LEGAL STANDARD In an unlawful detainer proceeding, a "motion for summary judgment may be made at any time after the answer is filed upon giving five-days notice. Summary judgment shall be granted or denied on the same basis as a motion under Section 437c."¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 1170.7.)¿As in ordinary civil cases, either party to an unlawful detainer action may file a motion for summary judgment when the complaint or answer as a whole has no merit as a matter of law.¿(CCP §§ 437c(a), 1170.7.) The purpose of a motion for summary judgment “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.”¿(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843 (Aguilar); Code Civ. Proc., § 437c (c).) A plaintiff reaches its burden on summary judgment by showing prima facie evidence for each element of its cause of action.¿(Code Civ. Proc, § 437c (p); Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519 (Scalf).)¿ The burden will then shift to the defendant to show the existence of a triable issue of material fact for at least one element of the cause of action at issue.¿(Ibid.)¿ Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment or summary adjudication and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.”¿(Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)¿However, if all inferences reasonably deducible from the submitted evidence are uncontradicted by other inferences and there is no triable issue as to any material fact, the moving party is entitled to summary adjudication as a matter of law.¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c (c); Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)  III. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE Defendant’s Requests In connection with the moving papers, Defendant requests the Court take judicial notice of (1) Executive Order N-78-20 issued by Governor Gavin Newsom on September 3, 2020, (2) "Official Action of the Los Angeles City Council" dated January 12, 2021, extending the COVID-19 Local Emergency for an additional 30 days, (3) Executive Order N-85-20 issued by Governor Gavin Newsom on December 30, 2020, and (4) Executive Order N-44-20 issued by Governor Gavin Newsom on April 3, 2020.  These requests are GRANTED. (Evid. Code. §§ 452(c).) These official acts are relevant as to whether Plaintiff’s rent increases were legal. In connection with the reply, Defendant requests the Court take judicial notice of Minute Order (9/16/2024) in the matter of 636 NHP LLC v. Alejandro Gutierrez (LASC Case No. 23STUD11888). The request is DENIED as unnecessary. Plaintiff’s Requests Plaintiff requests the Court take judicial notice of (1) Frank Ramos’, of the Investigations and Enforcement Section of the Los Angeles Housing and Community Investment Department (HCIDLA), December 17, 2020, letter to Nathan Richards, (2) Brandon Dimond, Esq.’s, response letter to Mr. Ramos’ letter dated January 13, 2021, and (3) Francis Ramos’, of the Investigations and Enforcement Section of the Los Angeles Housing and Community Investment Department (HCIDLA), letter dated January 14, 2021, to attorney Brandon Diamond in response to his letter of January 13, 2021. The requests are DENIED. The opinions of HCIDLA are not relevant to the disposition of the motion. (Gbur v. Cohen (1979) 93 Cal. App. 3d 296, 301 [Judicial notice “is always confined to those matters which are relevant to the issue at hand.”].  IV. DISCUSSION “The basic elements of unlawful detainer for nonpayment of rent contained in Code of Civil Procedure section 1161, subdivision (2), are (1) the tenant is in possession of the premises; (2) that possession is without permission; (3) the tenant is in default for nonpayment of rent; (4) the tenant has been properly served with a written three-day notice; and (5) the default continues after the three-day notice period has elapsed.” (Kruger v. Reyes (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th Supp. 10, 16 (internal citations omitted).) Code of Civil Procedure section 1161, subdivision (2), requires that a notice for the nonpayment of rent must state “the amount that is due, the name, telephone number, and address of the person to whom the rent payment shall be made….” The requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1161, subdivision (2), must be strictly complied with. (Levitz Furniture Co. v. Wingtip Communications, Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1035, 1038.)¿¿ The action is based on two Three-Day Notices to Pay Rent or Quit: (1) The first Notice to Pay demands a total of $27,000, representing $2,250 per month for the months of May 2023 through April 2024, and (2) The second Notice to Pay demands a total of $47,250, representing rent for the period of May 1, 2021 through September 30, 2021, and from October 1, 2021 through January 31, 2023, for a total of $47,250.00 at the rate of $2,250 per month. (Compl. Exh. A.) Defendant argues her rent increased from $1,000 to $1,174.80 effective June 1, 2019, increased to $1,239.41 effective August 1, 2020, and increased to $2,250 effective February 1, 2021. (Woocher Decl. ¶¶ 3-4; Exhs. A & B.) Defendant asserts Plaintiff the rent increase in February 2021 from $1,239.41 to $2,250.00 was in violation of Penal Code §396,¿which limits rent increases to 10% during declared emergencies. As such, Plaintiff’s Notices are defective and cannot support an unlawful detainer action. Penal Code § 396 is an anti-price gouging statute which aims to “protect citizens from excessive and unjustified increases in the prices charged during or shortly after a declared state of emergency or local emergency for goods and services that are vital and necessary for the health, safety, and welfare of consumers.” (Pen. Code § 396(a).) As such, its subsections limit price increases on essential goods and services after an emergency is declared. Subsection (b) provides that it is unlawful for a person or other entity to sell or offer to sell “housing… for a price of more than 10 percent greater than the price charged by that person for those goods or services immediately prior to the proclamation or declaration of emergency.” (Ibid., subd. (b).) Subsection (e) provides that it is unlawful for any person to “increase the rental price…advertised, offered, or charged for housing, to an existing or prospective tenant, by more than 10 percent.” (Ibid., subd. (e).) The provisions of Section 396(e) remain in effect during “any period the [emergency] proclamation or declaration is extended by the applicable authority [including local authorities].” (Ibid.)¿ On September 3, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Governor Newsom signed an order extending the duration of Penal Code § 396(b) protections to March 4, 2021. (Executive Order N-78-20.) Therefore, Penal Code § 396(b) tenant protections were in legal effect between March 4, 2020, and December 31, 2021. It is undisputed that Plaintiff increased Defendant’s rent from $1,239.41 to $2,250.00 in February 2021. This constitutes an approximate 80% rental increase during a state of emergency, in direct violation of Penal Code § 396(e). Additionally, a three-day notice to pay rent or quit under CCP § 1161(2) must state no more than the amount of rent due and it must be served after the stated amount becomes due. (CCP § 1161(2);¿Lydon v. Beach¿(1928) 89 Cal.App. 69, 74.) The notice provisions of CCP § 1161 requires strict compliance.¿(Feder v. Wreden Packing & Provision Co. (1928) 89 Cal.App.665, 670.) Because the 3-Day notice sought past-due amounts based on an illegal rent increase, it is therefore defective. The Court finds that Defendant has met her burden of production showing that Plaintiff is unable to prove an essential element of its unlawful detainer because the 3-Day Notice overstates the amount due in rent, and thus cannot support an unlawful detainer action. The burden shifts to Plaintiff to show a triable issue of fact regarding the validity of the 3-Day Notice. In opposition, Plaintiff argues Penal Code § 396 is in direct conflict with the Tenant Protection Act of 2019, which includes Civil Code section 1947.13. Plaintiff argues the Notices were valid because Civil Code Section 1947.13 must be read as an exception to Penal Code § 396. Additionally, Plaintiff argues HCIDLA determined that the Defendant’s rent increase was legal and that the statutory limitations on rent increases did not apply to this Property for this one-time adjustment, and that the Subject Property was exempt from the Tenant Protection Act of 2019 at the time the rent increase was given. The Court disagrees with Plaintiff’s contention that Penal Code § 396 and the Tenant Protection Act of 2019 are in direct conflict, such that full effect cannot be given to both. The anti-price gouging statute of Penal Code § 396 prohibiting an increase of price by more than 10 percent is a temporary protection, effective only during a proclaimed state of emergency. Reading the statutes in their entirety, the Court is not persuaded by Plaintiff’s arguments that the provisions lack harmony, would lead to absurdity, or that Penal Code § 396 is unconstitutional when Civil Code § 1947.13 is still applicable upon expiration of the emergency. Defendant’s reply directly addressing Plaintiff’s arguments are well reasoned, and the Court need not reiterate the points aptly raised. Any opinions by HCIDLA as to whether Defendant abided by Civil Code § 1947.12 and Civil Code § 1947.13 are not relevant. Plaintiff has therefore failed to meet its shifted burden of a triable issue of material fact pertaining to the validity of the 3-Day Notice.  V. CONCLUSION Accordingly, Defendant Marta Rodriguez’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.¿¿  Moving Party is ordered to give notice.  DATED: November 15, 2024 __________________________ Hon.
