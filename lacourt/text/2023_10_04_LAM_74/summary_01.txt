And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the parties' arguments and has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents (RFP Nos. 9 and 37-135). The defendant had previously served responses, but the plaintiff was dissatisfied with the responses and had met and conferred with the defendant. The judge found that the defendant's objections to the requests were too general and lacked specific facts to support them. Specifically, the judge noted that the defendant's objections to vagueness, overbreadth, and burdensomeness were not applied to any particular request. The judge also found that the defendant's response to RFP No. 9 was not code-compliant. As a result, the judge ordered the defendant to serve a complete, code-compliant, further response to the requests and to produce all documents in its possession, custody, or control that are responsive to the requests. The judge gave the defendant 30 days to comply with the order.

Summary:
This tentative ruling is about a future court hearing (Case Number: 21STCV47324, Hearing Date: October 4, 2023, Dept: 74) for a case between Raluca Pereira (Plaintiff) and Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC (Defendant) regarding a defective 2019 Land Rover Range Rover Sport (Subject Vehicle). The Plaintiff filed a motion to compel further responses to RFP Nos. 9 and 37-135, which the court granted. The Plaintiff argued good cause exists for discovering the documents sought in RFP Nos. 9 and 37-135 as they are relevant to the Plaintiff's claims that the subject vehicle contains defects, Defendant knew about those defects, and Defendant was unable to rectify those defects. The Plaintiff also clarified that the documents only concern vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the subject vehicle. The Defendant argued that the requests are vague, overbroad, burdensome, and seek proprietary and confidential information. However, the court found that the Defendant's objections were too general and did not apply to any particular request. Therefore, the court ordered the Defendant to serve on Plaintiff complete, code-compliant, further responses to these requests and to produce all documents in Defendant’s possession, custody, or control which are responsive to the same within 30 days of the date of this order.
