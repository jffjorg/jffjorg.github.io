```

And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to produce documents for inspection, also known as a Pitchess motion. The motion was filed on September 13, 2023, but is considered untimely because it was not filed at least 16 court days before the hearing date, as required by Evidence Code section 1043. The plaintiff had previously filed a complaint on January 3, 2023, and a notice of motion and supporting declaration on May 22, 2023, but did not file the motion itself until September 13, 2023. The court finds that the motion is not timely and therefore denies it.
