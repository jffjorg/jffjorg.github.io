 Case Number:  23STCV00093    Hearing Date:   October 4, 2023    Dept:  74 Mariela Isabel Avila v. City of
Irwindale, et al.
 
Plaintiff’s Pitchess Motion.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            The
court denies Plaintiff Mariela Isabel Avila’s motion because it is not timely.
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises from an
employment dispute.
            On
January 3, 2023, Plaintiff Mariela Isabel Avila (Plaintiff) filed a complaint
against City of Irwindale and former Chief of Police Ty Henshaw (Defendants). 
            On
May 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed the notice of this motion, the proposed order,
and a supporting declaration. However, Plaintiff did not file the motion
itself.
            On
September 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion for an order to produce
documents for inspection (Pitchess Motion). 
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff brings this motion under
Evidence Code section 1043. This statute provides that written notice shall be
given at the times prescribed by subdivision (b) of Section 1005 of the Code of
Civil Procedure. (Evid. Code, § 1043, subd. (a)(1).) The relevant provision
provides that, “[…] all moving and supporting papers shall be served and filed
at least 16 court days before the hearing.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd.
(b).) Plaintiff’s motion is untimely because she waited until September 13 to
file it. (Evid. Code, § 1043, subd. (d).)
CONCLUSION
                Based on the foregoing, the court denies
Plaintiff’s motion.
