```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's non-PAGA claims and individual PAGA claims. The plaintiff, Ricardo Torres, had filed a complaint against Lancaster Hospital Corporation, alleging various labor law violations. The defendant had filed a motion to compel arbitration, citing an arbitration agreement signed by the plaintiff in 2019. The court found that the agreement was valid and that the plaintiff's individual PAGA claims and non-PAGA claims should be arbitrated. However, the court denied the defendant's request to dismiss the plaintiff's non-individual PAGA claims, instead choosing to stay those claims pending the outcome of the arbitration. The court's decision is based on recent case law, including Viking River Cruises, Inc. v. Moriana and Adolph v. Uber Technologies, Inc., which held that private arbitration agreements cannot waive PAGA claims, but that individual PAGA claims can be arbitrated. The defendant has been ordered to give notice of the ruling.

The judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant's motion to compel arbitration of Plaintiff's non-PAGA claims and individual PAGA claims. The court denies Defendant's request to dismiss Plaintiff's non-individual PAGA claims and instead stays the non-individual PAGA claims pending the arbitration's outcome. This ruling is based on the plaintiff's agreement to arbitrate, which was signed on November 18, 2019, and the application of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) to the agreement. The California Supreme Court has held that an employee who has entered an enforceable arbitration agreement may be compelled to arbitrate his individual PAGA claims, but a plaintiff who files a PAGA action with individual and non-individual claims does not lose standing to litigate the non-individual claims in court simply because the individual claims have been ordered to arbitration.
