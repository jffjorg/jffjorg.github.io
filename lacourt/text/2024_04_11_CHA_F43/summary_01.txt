And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains Nevieux's demurrer to the Hews' cross-complaint on the grounds that the cross-complaint was filed late without a good explanation. The judge also sustains the demurrer to each cause of action individually. The judge finds that the Hews' cross-complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain. The judge also finds that the Hews failed to allege how they were harmed and damaged by the items being on their property. The judge concludes that the demurrer is sustained to the entire cross-complaint on the basis that the cross-complaint was untimely filed.
