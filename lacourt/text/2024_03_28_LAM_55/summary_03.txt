```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel Defendant Niami's deposition attendance and response to document requests. The motion is based on Defendant Niami's failure to attend a properly noticed deposition and to respond to a properly served document request. The Court finds that the motions sufficiently show that Defendant Niami failed to comply with the deposition notice and document requests. As there is no opposition filed to show substantial justification in avoiding sanctions, the Court grants the motion and will sign and file the proposed order lodged by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff also requests monetary sanctions in the sum of $7,247.00, which the Court will also grant, as the Defendant has failed to provide a substantial justification for its actions.
