And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a motion to compel further responses. The judge is disappointed that the plaintiff's counsel has failed to follow the court's rules regarding discovery disputes, specifically by not participating in an informal discovery conference (IDC) before filing the motion. The judge expects the parties to exhaust all meet and confer efforts before filing a motion to compel, and to schedule an IDC if they are unable to resolve their disputes. The judge has directed the plaintiff's counsel to review their pending cases and to follow the court's procedures for Discovery disputes in the future. If the plaintiff's counsel fails to follow these procedures again, the judge may take future motions off-calendar. The hearing on the motion to compel further responses will be continued to a date mutually agreed upon by the parties.
