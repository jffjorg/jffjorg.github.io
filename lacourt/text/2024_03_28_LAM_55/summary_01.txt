And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of the Defendants, granting their motion to compel arbitration. The Plaintiff, Kelley Cloud, had alleged discrimination, harassment, and wrongful termination by the Defendants, but the Defendants argued that the claims are subject to arbitration based on a written arbitration agreement. The Judge found that the Defendants had met their burden of showing the existence of the arbitration agreement, and since the Plaintiff failed to file an opposition document, the burden shifted to the Plaintiff to prove any defense to arbitration enforcement. The Judge sustained the Plaintiff's evidentiary objections to one of the declarations, but overruled the objections to the other declaration. The Judge concluded that the Plaintiff's failure to assert any evidence or argument contesting the arbitration agreement means that the Defendants have met and sustained their burden on the motion to compel. As a result, the motion is granted, and the case is stayed until the arbitration has been completed.
