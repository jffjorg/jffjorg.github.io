And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Izabella Papagelis v. Martha Hernandez, regarding the Defendant's motions to compel responses to discovery requests and to deem admitted the truth of facts in Requests for Admission. The Defendant had filed four motions on May 30, 2024, and July 10, 2024, seeking to compel responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production of Documents, as well as to deem admitted the truth of facts in Requests for Admission. The Plaintiff had failed to respond to these requests, and the Defendant had requested sanctions in the amount of $1,727.50.

The Judge has granted the Defendant's motions to compel responses to discovery requests, and has ordered the Plaintiff to serve code-compliant, objection-free, verified responses to the discovery requests within 60 days of service of the order. The Judge has also granted the Defendant's request to deem admitted the truth of facts in Requests for Admission, and has ordered the Plaintiff to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,727.50 within 30 days of service of the order.

The Judge has found that the Plaintiff's failure to respond to discovery requests is unreasonable and warrants sanctions. The Judge has also noted that the Plaintiff has failed to provide any reasonable justification for their failure to respond to the discovery requests.
