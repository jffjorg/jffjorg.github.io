Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for leave to file a first amended cross-complaint. The motion was filed by the defendants, Jacob S. Szmyanski and Caroline F. Szmyanski, who seek to add the plaintiff, Diana Turk Barnes, as a cross-defendant and ten new causes of action to their cross-complaint. The plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that it comes over a year after the original cross-complaint and that permitting leave to amend would severely prejudice the plaintiff.

The judge finds that the defendants' declarations supporting the motion do not fully comply with the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324. Specifically, the declarations do not specify when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered or why the request for amendment was not made earlier.

Based on these deficiencies, the court will continue the hearing to allow the defendants to address these issues. Supplemental papers are to be filed and served 10 days before the hearing. The court will consider the motion again at the continued hearing.
