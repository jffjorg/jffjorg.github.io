RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
            On May 30, 2024,
Defendant Martha Hernandez moved for three orders to compel the response of
Plaintiff Izabella Papagelis to (1) Form Interrogatories—Set One (and $585 in
sanctions), (2) Special Interrogatories—Set One (and $322.50 in sanctions), and
(3) Production of Documents—Set One (and $322.50 in sanctions). 
 
            On July 10, 2024,
Defendant moved for an order deeming admitted the truth of facts in Requests
for Admission—Set One (and $497.50 in sanctions). 
 
BACKGROUND
 
            On January 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a motor vehicle and negligence complaint alleging personal injury and property
damage, arising out of an October 28, 2022 car accident allegedly caused by
Defendant. Defendant asserts the facts of loss have not been established yet
and liability is in dispute. Discovery was propounded on Plaintiff, but
Plaintiff failed to respond at all. Defendant has no other means of obtaining
the information and documents relevant to Plaintiff’s claims, so Defendant has
made the subject motions for court orders.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Defendant’s motions to compel
responses to Special
Interrogatories—Set, Form Interrogatories—Set One, Requests for Production of
Documents—Set One are GRANTED.
 
Defendant’s request to deem the truths as admitted for the Requests for Admission—Set
One is GRANTED.
 
Defendant’s request for sanctions is GRANTED in the
amount of $1,727.50.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
If a responding party fails to serve timely responses to interrogatories,
the responding party waives all objections, including those based on privilege
and work product protection, and the propounding party may move for an order
compelling responses. (C.C.P. §§ 2030.290(a)-(b); Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 404.)
 
If a party fails to serve timely responses to requests for production of
documents, the responding party waives all objections, including those based on
privilege and work product and “[t]he party making the demand may move for an
order compelling [a] response to the demand.” (C.C.P. § 2031.300(a)-(b).)
Additionally, the Court “shall” award sanctions for failure to respond. (C.C.P.
§ 708.020.)
 
If a party to whom requests for admission are directed “fails to serve a
timely response,” the party to whom the requests are directed waives any
objection. (C.C.P. § 2033.280(a).) This section provides that “[t]he requesting
party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted”. (C.C.P. §
2033.280(b).) Additionally, it provides that the court “shall make this order”
unless it finds that the party to whom the requests have been directed has
served a proposed response in substantial compliance with section 2033.220
before the hearing on the motion. (C.C.P. § 2033.280(c).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
            On March 26, 2024, Defendant served Special Interrogatories—Set One, Form
Interrogatories—Set One, and Requests for Production of Documents—Set One on Plaintiff.
Verified responses were due April 29, 2024 for these three requests. On May 22,
2024, Defendant served its first set of Requests for Admission on Plaintiff. A
verified response was due June 26, 2024 to this request. Plaintiff has not
responded to the subject discovery requests, or any discovery in the action.
Her attorneys have no provided reasonable justification.
 
            On May 30, 2024, Defendant filed the
current motions to compel responses to (1) Form Interrogatories—Set One (and
$585 in sanctions), (2) Special Interrogatories—Set One (and $322.50 in
sanctions), and (3) Production of Documents—Set One (and $322.50 in sanctions).
On July 10, 2024, Defendant moved for an order deeming admitted the truth of
facts in Requests for Admission—Set One (and $497.50 in sanctions). The four
motions are made on the grounds that Plaintiff has failed to serve timely
responses and that the sanction requests represent reasonable attorney fees.
 
Plaintiff has not filed opposition to the motions.
 
The Court has no information with respect to whether any verified
discovery responses have been provided by Plaintiff since the time the motions
were filed. Under the assumption that no such verified responses have been
served, the Court will grant all the motions, and will issue an order
compelling Plaintiff to respond to the written discovery served upon them (as
articulated above) no later than 60 days after service of this order, or such
other date as this Court may specify at the hearing on these motions.
 
The Court will order Plaintiff, her attorneys, or both, to pay sanctions
in the total amount of the four sanction amounts requested. That is, (1) $585
for the form interrogatories, (2) $322.50 for the special interrogatories, (3)
$322.50 for the production of documents request, and (4) $497.50 for deeming
the truth of the requests for admission. The total amount is $1,727.50. The
Court finds these amounts to be a reasonable sanction for “no response” motions
to compel with respect to Plaintiff.
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Defendant’s motion to compel responses
to Special Interrogatories—Set
One is GRANTED.
 
Defendant’s motion to compel responses to Form Interrogatories—Set One is GRANTED.
 
Defendant’s motion to compel responses to Requests for Production of Documents—Set One
is GRANTED.
 
The court orders Plaintiff sixty days after service of
this order, to comply with this order. Plaintiff is to serve code-compliant, objection free,
verified responses, along with responsive documents for the following: Special
Interrogatories—Set One, Form Interrogatories—Set One, Requests for Production
of Documents—Set One. 
 
Defendant’s request to deem the truths as admitted for the Requests for
Admission—Set One is GRANTED. The court grants Defendant’s motion to deem
Plaintiff to have admitted the truth of the matters in the Requests for
Admissions—Set One.
 
Defendant’s request for sanctions is GRANTED in the
amount of $1,727.50 against Plaintiff. Sanctions are payable to Defendant
within 30 days of service of this order.
