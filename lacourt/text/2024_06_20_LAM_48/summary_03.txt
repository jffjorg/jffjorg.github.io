And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the petition to compel compliance with administrative subpoena duces tecum, ordering Respondent Uber Technologies, Inc. to produce the requested documents within 30 days. The petition was filed by the California Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Occupational Safety and Health, seeking to investigate the death of a delivery driver for Respondent. Respondent argued that Petitioner lacks authority to subpoena records and that the petition should be denied as moot due to the expiration of the statute of limitations. However, the court finds that Petitioner has broad authority to adopt regulations relating to the safety and welfare of employees, including the authority to issue subpoenas and conduct investigations. The court also finds that the subpoena seeks definite and relevant information, including training records and policies and procedures. The court concludes that the petition is granted and Respondent is ordered to produce the requested documents.
