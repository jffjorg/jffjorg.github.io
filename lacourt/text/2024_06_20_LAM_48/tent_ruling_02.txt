[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTION TO DISMISS;
  DISMISSING FALSE CLAIMS ACT CAUSES OF ACTION; GRANTING IN PART MOTION FOR LEAVE
  TO AMEND COMPLAINT 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.

On December 1, 2022, Plaintiff
Kevin Lofton (proceeding in pro per) filed this qui tam action on behalf of California
Student Aid Commission, California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, California
Breast Cancer Research Program, Local Initiative Health Authority for Los Angeles
County, Statewide Research Grant Authorities, and The State of California.  On January 31, 2023, Plaintiff filed a first amended
complaint (“FAC”).
On
February 2, 2023, the Court noted that Plaintiff is self-represented and thus may
not have the ability to pursue litigation on behalf of the State of California.  Accordingly, the Court set an Order to Show Cause
Re: Dismissal.
On
May 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the Court’s OSC and a motion for
leave to file a second amended complaint (“SAC”).
MOTION
TO DISMISS
Plaintiff
argues that the OSC should be dismissed because under California Rules of Court,
rule 2.573(e)(2), qui tam actions are exempt from rule 3.110 and the case management
rules in title 3, division 7.  Plaintiff also
argues that under Government Code section 12652, subdivision (c)(1), actions brought
under the False Claims Act may be dismissed only with the written consent of the
court and the attorney general.
This
OSC does not involve time for service of the FAC under Rule 3.110.  With respect to other case management issues and
dismissal of a qui tam action, the Court may at any time in its discretion strike
out any part of a pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the law.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (b).)
The
Motion for Order to Dismiss Court Order Re: OSC is DENIED.
ORDER
TO SHOW CAUSE RE: DISMISSAL
Although
no California statute codifies a general right to represent oneself, California
courts have consistently acknowledged this right.  (Baba v. Board of Supervisors (2004) 124
Cal.App.4th 504, 523-524.)  However, non-attorneys
may not practice law for others without being active members of the State Bar.  (Drake v. Superior Court (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th
1826, 1830; see Bus. & Prof. Code, § 6125 [“No person shall practice law in
California unless the person is an active licensee of the State Bar.”].)
By
bringing claims under the False Claims Act, Plaintiff attempts to represent the
State of California or a political subdivision. 
(See Gov. Code, § 12652, subd. (c)(1).) 
He cannot do this without being an attorney or being represented by an attorney.  (Cf. Stoner v. Santa Clara County Office of
Educ. (9th Cir. 2007) 502 F.3d 1116, 1126-1127 [a pro se relator may not prosecute
a federal False Claims Act case on behalf of the government].)
Plaintiff’s
False Claims Act claims are not filed in conformity with the law.  Accordingly, the Court STRIKES the first through
sixth causes of action in the FAC.  (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (b).)
MOTION
FOR LEAVE TO AMEND
Plaintiff
seeks leave to file a SAC to add additional factual allegations about Defendants’
involvement in the alleged conduct.  However,
the proposed SAC also contains the now-stricken qui tam claims.
The
motion is GRANTED IN PART.  Within 30 days,
Plaintiff may file an amended complaint with his proposed amendments to his
individual causes of action but without the causes of action brought under the False
Claims Act.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
