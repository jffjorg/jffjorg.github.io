And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment without prejudice, meaning the plaintiff can refile the motion in a procedurally proper manner. The reason for the denial is that the plaintiff failed to include a separate statement of undisputed material facts with its moving papers, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 437c subdivision (b). The judge notes that summary judgment is a drastic remedy and requires strict compliance with procedural requirements. The plaintiff's failure to comply with the separate statement requirement was prejudicial to the defendant, and therefore, the motion was denied. The judge orders the plaintiff to give notice of the denial.
