CASE:                         Century Recovery LLC v. Walter C.
Harris, et al. 
 
CASE NO.:                 22STCV24280            
 
MOTION
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff Century Recovery, LLC 
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): No response on
eCourt as of 10/23/23
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for breach of contract that was filed on July 27, 2022.
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant breached the terms of a loan agreement by
failing to make payments as required by its terms. 
 
Plaintiff moves for summary
judgment.
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff moves for summary
judgment.
 
            Plaintiff
did not include a Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts with its
moving papers. Code of Civil Procedure section 437c subdivision (b) states:
 
The supporting papers shall include
a separate statement setting forth plainly and concisely all material facts
that the moving party contends are undisputed. Each of the material facts
stated shall be followed by a reference to the supporting evidence. The failure
to comply with this requirement of a separate statement may in the
court’s discretion constitute a sufficient ground for denying the
motion.
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 437c subd.
(b)(1).) 
 
“Summary judgment, although a very
useful tool in litigation, is also a drastic remedy. Because of this, it is
important that all of the procedural requirements for the granting of such a
motion be satisfied before the trial court grants the remedy.” (Sierra
Craft, Inc. v. Magnum Enterprises, Inc. (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1252, 1256.)
Moreover, “[t]he separate statement is not merely a technical requirement, it
is an indispensable part of the summary judgment or adjudication process.” (Whitehead
v. Habig (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 896, 902.) 
The separate statement is required “not to satisfy a sadistic urge to
torment lawyers, but rather to afford due process to opposing parties and to
permit trial courts to expeditiously review complex motions for ... summary
judgment to determine quickly and efficiently whether material facts are
disputed.” (Id. [internal citation omitted].) 
 
Here, Plaintiff has failed to even
attempt compliance with the separate statement requirement for a motion for
summary judgment. Moreover, as Defendant has not responded to this motion, the
Court is obliged to presume that the failure to comply with the Code of Civil
Procedure was prejudicial to Defendant, and therefore cannot overlook
Plaintiff’s error. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion for
Summary Judgment is DENIED without prejudice to a procedurally proper
motion on the same basis. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
