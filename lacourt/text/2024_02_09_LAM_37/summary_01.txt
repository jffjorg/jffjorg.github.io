Summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies Plaintiff's Motion to Dismiss Arbitration due to Defendant's failure to prosecute and participate in arbitration. The court finds that the trial court has no jurisdiction to dismiss the arbitration proceeding and that the only remedy available is for the arbitrator to grant relief for delay in bringing the arbitration to a resolution. The court also denies Plaintiff's request to vacate the order compelling arbitration and remand the action back to court, finding that the order is an interlocutory order and not a judgment or decree that can be set aside and vacated under CCP § 663. Finally, the court denies Plaintiff's request for sanctions against Defendant, finding that the court has no authority to impose sanctions for conduct occurring in arbitration.
