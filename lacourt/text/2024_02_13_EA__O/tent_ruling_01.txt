Standard
California Code of
Civil Procedure §664.6(a) provides that, "If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the
court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, . . . the court,
upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement."

settlement agreement, Defendant agreed to make payments to Plaintiff. Defendant
has made payments totaling $36,000.00 since the start of this agreement. (Dyle
Decl.) However, Defendant has failed to make the payments, meaning he has
defaulted on the agreement. Per the settlement agreement, Defendant has 14 days
from the date of mailing to cure their default or else Plaintiff may move for
entry of judgment. Defendant has not cured the default.

Based on the
foregoing, the court GRANTS the motion and enters judgment in favor of
