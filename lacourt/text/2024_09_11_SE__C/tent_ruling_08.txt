TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Defendant
Western Dental Services, Inc.’s motion to compel arbitration is GRANTED. The
action is stayed pending arbitration. 
 
Moving
Party to give NOTICE.
 
 
This is a wage-and-hour action. Defendant Western
Dental Services, Inc. moves to compel arbitration based on a contract Plaintiff
signed. Defendant also requests a stay of the action pending arbitration. 
 
Procedural Background
 
On April 18, 2023, Plaintiff submitted a demand
for arbitration with JAMS. (Decl. Sohn, ¶ 2.) JAMS
confirmed submission. (Decl. Sohn, ¶ 3, 4; Ex. A
and B.) 
 
On May 17, 2023, Plaintiff paid her filing fee.
(Decl. Sohn, ¶ 7.) 
 
On June 20, 2023, JAMS informed all parties
that Defendant had not paid its filing fee. (Decl. Sohn, ¶
10.) 
 
In July 2023, JAMS informed Plaintiff that
Defendant paid its filing fee on June 28, 2023. (Decl. Sohn, ¶
12.) 
 
Plaintiff withdrew the demand for arbitration
and subsequently filed the instant lawsuit on August 15, 2023. (Decl. Sohn, ¶
14.) 
 
On January 4, 2024, Defendant filed the instant
motion. 
 
Discussion 
 
The parties dispute the applicability of Code
of Civil Procedure section 1281.97, which states that in an employment
arbitration, if the drafting party does not pay the fees or costs to start an
arbitration within 30 days of the due date, the drafting party materially
breaches the agreement, defaults on the arbitration, and waives its right to
compel arbitration under Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2.
 
Defendant argues that because the parties have
chosen the Federal Arbitration Act to govern their arbitration, California
state law which provides for waiver of arbitration does not apply. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that the
Califiornia Arbitration Act applies in California courts by default; in its
moving papers, Defendant acknowledges that California law applies; the
arbitration agreement recognizes the applicability of California law; Code of
Civil Procedure section 1281.97 furthers the objectives of the Federal
Arbitration Act; and Plaintiff’s case law citations are inapplicable to this
situation. 
 
In reply, Defendant relies upon Hernandez v.
Sohnen Enterprises, Inc. (2024) 102 Cal.App.5th 222, review granted August
21, 2024, S285696.  There, the appellate
court held that the procedures of the Califiornia Arbitration Act do not apply,
including the provision that allows an employee to proceed to court based on an
employer’s material breach and waiver.  The Court relies upon Hernandez for its
persuasive authority. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.1115.) 
 
In Hernandez v. Sohnen Enterprises, Inc., supra, 102 Cal.App.5th 222, an employer did not pay arbitration costs
within 30 days of the due date and the employee filed a motion to withdraw from
arbitration and litigate in state court as permitted under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1281.97. The Court held that the arbitration agreement is
governed by the FAA, both substantively and procedurally, rather than California’s
arbitration laws. Further, the Court held that when an agreement falls within
the scope of the FAA and does not expressly adopt California arbitration laws,
the FAA preempts the provisions of section 1281.97 that mandate findings of
breach and waiver. As the Court reasoned, because the arbitration agreement states, “this agreement
is governed by the FAA,” the statement is broad and encompasses both the
procedural and substantive provisions of the FAA. (Id. at pg. 241.) Further,
there is no provision explicitly referring to California law in the agreement. (Id.
at pg. 242.) The parties selected the procedural provisions of the FAA, and
therefore, the procedures of the CAA, including section 1281.97, do not apply. (Ibid.) 
 
Similarly, here, the arbitration agreement
states, “This agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act…” (Decl.
Sohn, ¶ 16, Ex. H.) It also does not expressly adopt California’s arbitration
laws. (Decl. Sohn, ¶ 16, Ex. H.)
 
Thus, the procedures of the CAA, including
section 1281.97, do not apply. 
 
If a court has ordered arbitration of a
controversy which is pending before a court, upon motion of a party to such
action or proceeding, the court shall stay the action or proceeding until an
arbitration occurs in accordance with the order to arbitrate or until such
earlier time as the court specifies. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.4.)
 
The motion is GRANTED. The action is stayed
pending arbitration.
