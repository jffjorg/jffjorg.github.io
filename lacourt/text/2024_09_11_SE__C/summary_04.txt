```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has set aside and vacated the order granting terminating sanctions against the Plaintiffs, Enrique Betancourt, Jr. and Maria Betancourt. The Plaintiffs had failed to serve responses to the Defendant's discovery requests, leading to the original order. However, the Plaintiffs have since served the required responses, and the Judge has reconsidered the imposition of monetary sanctions. The Defendant had requested $2,615.00 in monetary sanctions, but the Judge has imposed a lesser amount of $1000.00 against the Plaintiffs, payable within 90 days. The Judge's ruling is based on the fact that the Plaintiffs have now complied with the discovery requests, and the Defendant's request for monetary sanctions is reduced accordingly.
