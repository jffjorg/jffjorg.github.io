TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Defendant C&C
Mortgage Processing Company, Christine Campos, and Jose Lozano’s motion to
strike is DENIED.    
 
Moving Party to give NOTICE.

 
 
Background
 
This
is a dispute about home improvements made on Plaintiff’s property by Defendants.
On September 14, 2023, the Court sustained Defendants’ demurrer and granted
Plaintiffs 20 days leave to amend the complaint.  Thus, the amended complaint was due October
4, 2023.  
 
On
October 19, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint for the following:
 
 
1.   
Breach
of Contract;
2.   
Recovery
of Compensation Paid to Unlicensed Contractors;
3.   
Fraud;
and 
4.   
Elder
Abuse. 
 
Defendants
move to strike the first amended complaint. 
 
Meet
and Confer
 
The
parties satisfied the meet-and-confer requirements. (Decl. Catron, ¶ 5, 6; Code
Civ. Proc., § 435.5, subd. (a).) 
 
Legal
Standard
 
A
court may strike a pleading if it has irrelevant, false, or improper matter, or
has not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436.) 
 
Discussion

 
Defendants
argue that the Court should grant the motion to strike because Plaintiffs
missed their leave to amend deadline. 
Defendants do not indicate they suffered any prejudice as a result of
the late filing.  
 
In
its discretion, the Court denies the motion to strike.
