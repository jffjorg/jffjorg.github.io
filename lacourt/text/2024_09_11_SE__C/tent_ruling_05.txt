TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Plaintiff
Ana Teresa Garcia’s motion to compel the deposition of Defendant American Honda
Motor Company, Inc.’s Person Most Qualified is MOOT.   
 
Moving
Party to give NOTICE.
 
 
This is a Song-Beverly action. Plaintiff Ana Teresa Garcia moves to compel Defendant’s Person Most Qualified
(PMQ) deposition according to Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450.  
 
Legal
Standards
 
If
a party or an officer, director, managing agent, or
employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a
party under Section 2025.230 does not appear for deposition after service of a
deposition notice and the party has not validly objected, the noticing party
may move to compel the deponent’s attendance and testimony. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (a).)  
 
Article 2, commencing with Section 2025.210, sets forth
the grounds for objection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410, subd.
(a).) A party served with a deposition notice waives any error or irregularity
unless that party serves a written objection specifying that error or
irregularity at least three calendar days before the deposition. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.410, subd. (a).) 
 
Discussion
 
On August 16, 2024, Plaintiff noticed the
deposition of Defendant’s person most qualified for September 5, 2024. (Decl.
Chang, ¶ 5, Ex. 1.) On August 23, 2024, Defendant’s counsel asked Plaintiff to
withdraw the instant motion because Defendant’s counsel agreed to the September
5, 2024, deposition date. (Decl. Chang, ¶ 6.) Trial is scheduled for October 3,
2024.  
 
Thus, the motion is MOOT.
