And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motion to strike the first amended complaint filed by the plaintiffs. The motion to strike was based on the argument that the plaintiffs missed the deadline to file their leave to amend the complaint, but the defendants did not demonstrate any prejudice as a result of the late filing. The judge exercised its discretion and denied the motion to strike, allowing the amended complaint to proceed. The amended complaint alleges breach of contract, recovery of compensation paid to unlicensed contractors, fraud, and elder abuse.
