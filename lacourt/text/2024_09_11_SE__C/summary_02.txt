And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the stay of the lawsuit should be terminated and the case should proceed. The plaintiff, Marcel Padilla, alleged that his half-brother, Hermenegildo Espinoza Mendoza, and his family members breached an oral contract regarding the management of properties in Mexico. The defendants moved to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that Mexico was a more convenient forum. The court initially stayed the action pending institution and final determination of the probate case in Mexico. However, the plaintiff hired a Mexican attorney and filed a complaint in Mexico, which was subsequently dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

The plaintiff argues that he has no legal remedy in Mexico and that California is the proper forum. The court finds that the plaintiff has made a prima facie showing that he has no legal remedy in Mexico and that California is the proper forum. Therefore, the judge has tentatively ruled that the stay should be terminated and the case should proceed.

The judge has set a hearing on the plaintiff's renewed motion to terminate the stay for November 14, 2024, at 10:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C. The parties are required to file opposition and reply briefs in compliance with the new hearing date.
