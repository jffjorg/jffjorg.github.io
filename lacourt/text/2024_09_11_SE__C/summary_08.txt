And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled in favor of the defendant, Western Dental Services, Inc., granting its motion to compel arbitration. As a result, the action is stayed pending arbitration. The judge's decision is based on the arbitration agreement between the plaintiff, Nolan, and the defendant, which states that it is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). The judge found that the procedures of the California Arbitration Act (CAA) do not apply in this case, citing the California Court of Appeal's recent decision in Hernandez v. Sohnen Enterprises, Inc. The judge also noted that the defendant's failure to pay arbitration fees initially did not result in a material breach of the agreement, as the FAA preempts the provisions of California law that would otherwise apply.
