TENTATIVE RULING
 
The Court’s July 10, 2024 order granting terminating sanctions against
Plaintiffs is SET ASIDE AND VACATED.  Monetary
sanctions are awarded. 

 
Defenants to give NOTICE. 
 
 
This is a continuation. This is a dispute
between family members over ownership of real property located at 9800 San
Carlos Avenue, Units A, B, and C, in South Gate, California 90280. The parties
are siblings. Plaintiffs Enrique Betancourt, Jr. and Maria Betancourt sued Angel
Betancourt for the following: (1) resulting trust; (2) constructive trust; (3)
breach of fiduciary duty; (4) quiet title; and (5) accounting. 
 
At the July 10, 2024 hearing, Defendant Angel Betancourt’s motion for
terminating sanctions was granted. The Court stayed the order until September
11, 2024 at 9:30 A.M. in Dept. SE-C.  If
Plaintiffs did not respond to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories (Set One) and
Special Interrogatories (Set Two) by the hearing date or show good cause why
responses have not been produced, the stay would be lifted and terminating
sanctions will be ordered.  
 
In declarations
filed on September 3, 2024, Plaintiffs Maria Betancourt and Enrique Betancourt state
that on or about August 20, 2024, they served responses to Defendant’s Form
Interrogatories, Set One and Special Interrogatories, Set One. (Decl. Enrique
Betancourt, ¶ 5; Decl. Maria Betancourt, ¶ 5.) They did not state whether they
served responses to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Set Two.  (Decl. Enrique Betancourt, ¶ 5; Decl. Maria
Betancourt, ¶ 5.)
 
Because Plaintiffs
have now served discovery responses upon Defendant, the order granting
terminating sanctions against Plaintiffs is set aside and vacated.  The Court will reconsider the imposition of
monetary sanctions.  
 
Sanctions
 
If
a party engages in the misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose
sanctions including terminating, evidence, and monetary sanctions. (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).) Disobeying a court order to provide
discovery is a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010,
subd. (g).) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery also constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.010, subd. (d).)
 
Defendants
request $2,615.00 in monetary sanctions: 7 hours for legal research at $295.00
per hour; appearance fee of $450.00; and $100.00 in costs for filing and
service fees. (Decl. Lanphere, ¶ 29.) 
 
In opposition to
Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions, Plaintiff Maria Betancourt stated
that given the financial condition she and her brother were in, she could no
longer afford legal representation. (Decl. Betancourt, ¶ 8.) She said she tried
to get her case file from her former counsel from December 8, 2023 to May 2024.
(Decl. Betancourt, ¶ 11.) She also said that “Attorney Santana” told her that
Attorney Mojarro stated that he had no notice of the October 12, 2023,
sanctions. (Decl. Betancourt, ¶ 15.) She further states that “Attorney Santana”
will request the file from Attorney Mojarro and upon receipt, she will be able
to address the issues raised by the October 12, 2023 order. (Decl. Betancourt,
¶ 19.)
 
Under the
circumstances, the Court imposes monetary sanctions in the amount of $1000.00
against Plaintiffs, jointly and severally, payable within 90 days.
