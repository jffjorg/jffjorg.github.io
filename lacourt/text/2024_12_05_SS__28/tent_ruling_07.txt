provides: 
“(a) When actions involving a common question of law
or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of
any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions
consolidated and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may
tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1048,
subd. (a).) 
California

named parties in each case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names
of their respective attorneys of record; 
“(B)  Contain
the captions of all the cases sought to be consolidated, with the lowest
numbered case shown first; and 
“(C)  Be filed
in each case sought to be consolidated. 
“(2)  The motion
to consolidate:

a single motion for the purpose of determining the appropriate filing fee, but
memorandums, declarations, and other supporting papers must be filed only in
the lowest numbered case; 
“(B)  Must be
served on all attorneys of record and all nonrepresented parties in all of the
cases sought to be consolidated; and 
“(C)  Must have

Los

two or more cases may be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in
different departments, have been related into a single department, or if the cases
were already assigned to that department. (2) Upon consolidation of cases, the
first filed case will be the lead case, unless otherwise ordered by the court.
After consolidation, all future papers to be filed in the consolidated case
must be filed only in the case designated as the lead case. (3) Before
consolidation of a limited case with an unlimited case, the limited case must
be reclassified as an unlimited case and the reclassification fee paid.”
