And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. The case is about a negligence and loss of consortium lawsuit filed by Sara Martinez and Christian Martinez against Erica Imsen. Christian Martinez did not provide timely responses to Defendant's request for production of documents and form interrogatories. The judge grants Defendant's motion to compel Christian Martinez's responses to these requests and orders Christian Martinez to serve verified code-compliant responses without objections by January 3, 2025. The judge also grants Defendant's motion to compel Christian Martinez's responses to the form interrogatories. However, the judge denies Defendant's requests for monetary sanctions because Christian Martinez did not make or oppose a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or a demand for inspection. The judge refers to California Court of Appeal cases and statutes, including Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290, 2031.300, 2023.010, and 2023.030, in making its ruling.
