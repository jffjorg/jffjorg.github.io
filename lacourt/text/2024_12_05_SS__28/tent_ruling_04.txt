PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Apex
asks the Court (1) to deem admitted matters specified in requests for
admission, set one, served on Plaintiff, (2) to impose sanctions on Plaintiff,
and (3) to strike Plaintiff’s late opposition. 
Plaintiff
asks the Court (1) to deny Apex’s motion and (2) to impose sanctions on Apex. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides: 
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The requesting party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)  
DISCUSSION 
A.   Background and arguments 
On July
11, 2024, Apex served requests for admission, set one, on Plaintiff. (Brison
dec., exh. A.)  On August 19, 2024, Apex
re-sent the requests for admission to Plaintiff.  (Brison dec., exh. C.)  On August 30, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel’s
office emailed Apex’s counsel stating, “Responses will be served today.”  (Brisnon dec., exh. E.)  However, Plaintiff did not serve timely
responses and had not served responses by the time Apex filed this motion on October
7, 2024. 
In Plaintiff’s
late opposition, Plaintiff argues that her counsel never received Apex’s
requests for admission because “plaintiff’s counsel’s email network was
compromised due to malware attacks on July 3, 2024, which disabled the law
firm’s email by rerouting more than half of all incoming and outgoing firm
emails (including internal staff emails) to an unknown RSS Folder.”  (Opposition p. 2.)  
Yet
Plaintiff does not deny that Apex’s counsel re-sent the requests for admission
to Plaintiff’s counsel on August 19, 2024. 
(See Brinson dec., exh. C.)  Plaintiff
does not explain why she did not serve timely responses to these requests for
admission. 
Plaintiff
argues that on November 26, 2024, she served code-compliant responses to Apex’s
requests for admission. 
Apex argues the responses contain objections and the Court should compel Plaintiff to provide substantive
responses to the requests for admission. 
B.   Analysis and rulings 
The
Court exercises its discretion to consider Plaintiff’s late opposition. 
The
Court denies Apex’s motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests
for admission, set one, because Plaintiff “served, before the hearing on the
motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in
substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (c).)  If Apex believes that any
answers are evasive or incomplete or that any objections are without merit or
too general, Apex may “move for an order compelling a further response” in compliance
with Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.290 and the Court’s Eighth Amended
Standing Order. 
The
Court grants Apex’s request for monetary sanctions because Plaintiff’s “failure
to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  Apex requests monetary sanctions of $1,461.65 based
on five hours of attorney time at a rate of $280.00 per hour and one $61.65
filing fee.  Counsel spent 2.5 hours
preparing the moving papers and anticipated spending 1.5 hours reviewing
Plaintiff’s opposition and preparing a reply brief and one hour attending the
hearing. 
The
Court awards Apex $811.65 based on three hours of attorney time at a reasonable
rate of $250.00 per hour and one filing fee. 
The
Court denies Apex’s request to impose an additional sanction of $1,000.00 “to
deter Plaintiff and her counsel from additional abuses of the discovery
process.” 
The
Court denies Plaintiff’s request for sanctions. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES Defendant Apex Security
Group, Inc.’s motion to deem admitted matters
specified in requests for admission, set one, served on Plaintiff
Swati Vutukuri. 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Apex Security Group, Inc.’s request
for monetary sanctions and orders Plaintiff Swati Vutukuri and her counsel to
pay Defendant Apex Security Group, Inc.
$811.65 by January 6, 2025. 
The Court DENIES Defendant Apex Security Group, Inc.’s
request to strike Plaintiff Swati Vutukuri’s opposition. 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Swati Vutukuri’s request for monetary sanctions.
