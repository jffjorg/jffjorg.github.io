BACKGROUND 
On

Farias (“Farias”) filed this action against Defendants Debbie’s Bridal
(“Defendant”) and Does 1-10 for general negligence and premises liability.  The complaint alleged that Gonzalez was injured

the summons, complaint, and other documents on a person authorized to receive

Defendant’s behalf. 
On

Court construed as a motion for terminating sanctions) and struck Defendant’s

and $35,490.00 for past medical expenses.  The statements of damages included proofs of
service showing service on Defendant by e-mail and mail on January 6, 2023.

LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
          California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a), provides: 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not
sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under
Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a)(7).) 
B.       Damages 
 On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a
cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56, citing Johnson
v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred in applying
preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
The
relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a defendant's default cannot exceed
the amount demanded in the complaint or, for personal injury cases where
damages may not be stated in the complaint, the amount listed in the statement
of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a), 585, subd. (b).) “The notice
requirement of section 580 was designed to insure fundamental fairness.” (Becker
v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures
that “defendants in cases which involve a default judgment have adequate notice
of the judgments that may be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment
other than that which is demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has
been deprived of his day in court—a right to a hearing on the matter
adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A trial court exceeds its jurisdiction
if it awards damages in excess of the amount specified in the complaint or
statement of damages. (Id. at p. 494.) 
DISCUSSION 
          Plaintiffs ask the Court to award Farias $25,000.00 in
emotional distress damages but Plaintiffs have not submitted a declaration by
Farias to support the request.  Instead, Plaintiffs have submitted a declaration
by Gonzalez stating that Farias suffered emotional distress.  The Court cannot grant damages for emotional distress to a
plaintiff who has not submitted a declaration supporting the request for those
damages. 
       Because Plaintiffs’ proposed judgment includes an award of
$25,000.00 which the record does not support, the Court denies Plaintiffs' application
for default judgment.         
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice the application for default judgment against Defendant Debbie’s Bridal filed by
Plaintiffs Gabriela Romero Gonzalez and
Lourdes Farias on September 16, 2024. 
Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
