And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the documents submitted in support of the request for default judgment and has ruled that the application is denied without prejudice. The plaintiff, Gabriela Romero Gonzalez, and her daughter, Lourdes Farias, brought an action against Debbie's Bridal for general negligence and premises liability. The plaintiff, Gonzalez, was injured when she tripped and fell on the defendant's premises, and her daughter, Farias, saw the incident and suffered emotional distress.

The defendant failed to respond to the complaint, and the plaintiff's answer was struck. The defendant was subsequently declared in default. The plaintiff filed a statement of damages, which included proofs of service showing service on the defendant. However, the plaintiff failed to submit a declaration from Farias to support the request for emotional distress damages.

The judge ruled that it cannot grant damages for emotional distress to a plaintiff who has not submitted a declaration supporting the request for those damages. Therefore, the judge denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
