 Case Number:  21STCV19681    Hearing Date:   December 5, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the documents submitted in support of the request for default
judgment, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
May 25, 2021, Plaintiff Kenneth Rodriguez (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Luis Angel Rivera Hernandez and Does 1-100 for motor vehicle
tort. 
On
September 28, 2021, Plaintiff amended the complaint to include Defendant Rivera
Alberto Hernandez as Doe 1. 
On
June 23, 2022, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing substituted service
on Alberto Rivera Hernandez of the summons, complaint, statement of damages re
Doe 1, and other documents on October 16, 2021. 
On
August 17, 2022, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing substituted service
on Alberto Rivera Hernandez of the summons, complaint, statement of damages,
and other documents on October 16, 2021. 
On
August 19, 2022, the clerk entered the default of Alberto Rivera Hernandez. 
On
November 22, 2022, the Court dismissed Does 1-100 without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
On
February 6, 2023, the Court dismissed Defendant Luis Angel Rivera Hernandez
without prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. 
On
April 21, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to vacate the dismissal of
Defendant Rivera Alberto Hernandez (Doe 1). 
On
October 19, 2023, the Court denied Plaintiff’s request for default
judgment.  The Court observed: “[T]he
September 28, 2021 Doe amendment named Defendant Rivera Alberto Hernandez as
Doe 1. However, the proof of substituted service filed on June 23, 2022 and
August 17, 2022, showing service of the summons, complaint, statement of
damages, and other documents stated the service was made on Alberto Rivera
Hernandez.  Similarly, the August 19,
2023 request for entry of default listed Defendant Alberto Rivera Hernandez.
Plaintiff has not established that Defendant Rivera Alberto Hernandez (Doe 1)
is in default.” 
On
February 16, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s request to amend the complaint
to substitute the defendant’s true name, Alberto Rivera Hernandez, in place of
the incorrect name, Rivera Alberto Hernandez/Doe 1. 
On June
26, 2024, Plaintiff filed an application for publication.  The application asserted that Plaintiff had
not been able to serve the summons and complaint on Alberto Rivera Hernandez.  On July 26, 2024, the Court granted the
application. 
On
September 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed a proof of service by publication of the summons,
complaint, and statement of damages on Alberto Rivera Hernandez.  Publication took place once a week from
August 3, 2024 to August 24, 2024.  The publication included a statement of damages listing general damages of $250,000.00, medical expenses "in excess of" $10,615.00, and future medical expenses "in excess of" $10,000.00.
On
October 8, 2024, the clerk entered Defendant Alberto Rivera Hernandez’s
default. 
On November
4, 2024, Plaintiff filed an application for default judgment against Defendant Alberto
Rivera Hernandez (“Defendant”). 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
          Plaintiff asks the Court to enter a default judgment
against Defendant and award Plaintiff $15,000.00, consisting of $3,865.00 in
special damages and $11,135.00 in general damages.

3.1800(a), provides: 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment

cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice

v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred in applying
preponderance of the evidence standard].)

complete default judgment application with all required information.  The Court grants the application and awards
