And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is sustained, but with leave to amend. The plaintiff, Adam Isai Palma, has sued the defendant, Providence Health System – Southern California dba Providence Holy Cross Medical Center, for three causes of action: general negligence, medical malpractice, and premises liability. The judge found that the complaint is too vague, ambiguous, and uncertain, and does not plead the required elements for each cause of action. The judge also found that the general negligence cause of action is duplicative of the medical malpractice cause of action. The judge has given the plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint.
