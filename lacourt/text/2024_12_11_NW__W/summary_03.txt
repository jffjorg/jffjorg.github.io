And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Sarkis Takvoryan's motion to set aside the default judgment entered against him on August 29, 2024. The judge found that Takvoryan's failure to respond was due to a mistake, rather than a lack of interest in the case. The judge noted that Takvoryan was working with Plaintiff's counsel to resolve the issue of his ownership of the vehicle involved in the accident, and that Plaintiff's counsel's failure to notify him of the impending default judgment prevented him from filing an answer. The judge granted the motion in the interests of fairness and justice, and ordered Takvoryan to file his answer within 20 days.
