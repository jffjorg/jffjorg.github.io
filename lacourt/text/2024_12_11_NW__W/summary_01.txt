Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees in part. The plaintiff had requested $246,430.00 in fees, but the court reduced the amount to $151,720.00. The judge found that the hourly rates of the plaintiff's counsel were reasonable, but reduced the amount of time spent on certain tasks due to duplicative billing or excessive billing. The court also reduced the amount of fees requested by the Chen law firm due to unjustifiable billing practices.
