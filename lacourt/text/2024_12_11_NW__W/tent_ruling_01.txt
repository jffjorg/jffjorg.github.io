BACKGROUND
 
This is a landlord-tenant action. 
On March 25, 2019, Plaintiff Wen Shen, on behalf of herself and her teen-aged
daughter (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against their landlord,
Defendant Gary Prato, for damages arising from a plumbing line break and
retaliatory eviction.  In the second amended complaint, Plaintiffs alleged
(1) breach of warranty of habitability; (2) negligence; (3) constructive
eviction; (4) nuisance; (5) retaliation; and (6) breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment. 
 
On March 24, 2022, the Court granted
Defendant’s motion for summary judgment as to the second, third, fourth, and
sixth causes of action. 
 
This action went to jury trial on the
two remaining causes of action for breach of warranty of habitability and
retaliation.  The jury found in favor of Defendant Prato on Plaintiffs’
claim for Breach of the Implied Warranty of Habitability.  The jury found
in favor of Plaintiff Shen on Plaintiffs’ claim for Retaliation.  The jury
awarded Plaintiffs damages of $21,020.00. 
 
On August 19, 2022, Plaintiffs filed
their motion for attorneys’ fees, seeking $246,430.00. The court denied
Plaintiff’s motion for attorneys’ fees and Plaintiff appealed. The Court of
Appeals reversed the trial court’s order denying attorney fees and remanded for
the trial court to determine a reasonable award. 
 
This matter initially came on for
hearing on November 9, 2024. At that time, both parties requested the ability
to submit additional briefing in support and in opposition to the fee
request.  Plaintiff submitted a declaration
about the underlying action, which provided little new information for the
court to consider with respect to this motion.  
Defendant did not file further briefing despite being given the
opportunity to do so.  
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
 The
motion for attorney fees is granted in part. 

 
 
discussion
 
Plaintiffs move this court for an award
of attorneys’ fees in the amount $246,430.00. 
Defendant initially opposed the motion on the ground that attorneys’
fees are capped at $1,000.00 per the parties’ lease agreement. The trial court
found pursuant to the Lease Agreement, Plaintiffs were only entitled to recover
$1,000.00 in attorney fees and costs, collectively.  Plaintiffs appealed. A
brief overview of the procedural history is as follows: 
 
The trial court ruled on Plaintiff’s
Memorandum of Costs and Motion for Attorney Fees in two stages. On December 9,
2022, the trial court granted Defendant’s motion to tax costs over $1,000.00 on
the grounds that the lease agreement between the parties capped costs and
attorney fees at $1,000.00. The Court of Appeal saw no error in the trial
court’s decision to limit the award of such costs to the $1,000.00 amount
specified in the lease agreement. 
 
As noted above, on February 7, 2023, the
trial court denied Plaintiff’s motion for attorney fees on similar grounds that
the $1,000.00 cap had been reached with the cost award. The trial court found
that the retaliatory eviction cause of action arose out of the lease agreement
and so the contractual $1,000.00 limitation was valid. The trial court also
rejected Plaintiff’s argument that Civil Code section 1942.5 allows for
attorney fees for claims of retaliation based on Code of Civil Procedure
section 1021. The trial court found the only conclusion that could be drawn
from the two statutes was that “where attorneys’ fees are authorized by statute
but capped by private contract, the trial court is to award attorneys’ fees
pursuant to the contract.” (Minute Order February 7, 2023.) The Court of Appeal
reversed the decision, finding Code of Civil Procedure section 1021 did not
“elevate a contractual exception to the American rule over a statutory
exception to the American rule” and that “Section 1942.5 expressly provides
that ‘the court shall award reasonable attorney’s fees to the prevailing party.’”
The Court of Appeal noted the trial court does have discretion to reduce the
amount of attorney fees awarded under Section 1942.5. 
 
Upon remand, the trial court requested
Plaintiff’s counsel to file additional documentation and encouraged counsel to
reach an agreement on attorney fees given the decision of the Court of Appeal.
Plaintiff objected to the trial court’s instruction on the grounds the
remittitur had yet to issue. No further briefs were filed. The instant action
was transferred to this court in October 2024. 
 
The court has received the initial
motion for attorney fees and rules as following: 
 
Plaintiff contends Counsel Zakari
incurred a total number of hours of 151.3 at a rate of $500 per hour for a
total of $75,650.00; Counsel Marchetti spent 176.20 hours at a rate of $500 per
hour for a total of $88,100.00; and Mr. Cheng spent for a total of 275.6 hours
at a rate of $300 per hour for a total $82,680.00, thus totaling $246,430.00. 
 
Hourly Rate
 
The court’s review of Attorney Zakari
and Counsel Marchetti’s declaration and their description of  their years of experience as well as the
complexity of this litigation leads to the conclusion that the hourly rates
requested are reasonable.  The Declaration
of Attorney Chen is without any substance to justify the hourly rates charged
by his associates.  As to his own hourly
rate, he merely states that he has been practicing since 2010 and is
experienced.  This declaration is
insufficient to support the amounts charged for any attorney other than Mr.
Chen; as to Mr. Chen, his hourly rate is low enough and the work he did appears
to the court to have been reasonable and necessary that the court will allow
his hourly charge of $300 per hour.  
 
Reasonability of Hours Incurred 
 
There
were numerous examples of duplicative billing or excessive billing.  The court highlights the fact that
plaintiff’s counsel together, both experienced counsel commanding rates
commensurate with their experience, spent 42.8 hours opposing a straightforward
motion for summary judgment, where most of the facts were disputed, and the
only evidence presented was deposition excerpts from the plaintiff and defendant’s
deposition and plaintiff’s declaration. 
The amount of time reasonably spent on such opposition should have been
no more than 20 hours. The court has cut the requested attorney fees to reflect
this overbilling.   There is also
duplicative work throughout the case, where both attorneys would communicate
with the client, or prepare the client, or take on other routine tasks.  The court has cut the request for fees to
disallow this time.   The court, however,
did allow for both attorneys to be present and to bill for their time at trial
in consideration of the extra burden of conducting  trial without the assistance of experienced
co-counsel.   
 
Marchetti
Billing Records and Hours 
 
            Having
reviewed the billing records of the Marchetti firm, the court disallows the
time sought for January 19, 26, February 2, 18, 21, and 28 as duplicative (1.2
hours), or $600. Of the total 24.9 hours spent by Mr. Marchetti to oppose the
summary judgment motion, the court allows only 10, reducing his hours by 14.9
hours, or $7450. The court finds Mr. Marchetti’s work on the pretrial documents
to be excessive and duplicative of Mr. Zakari’s, warranting a further reduction
of 3.5 or $1750.  The court disallows the
time sought by him for time spent travelling to court and appearing on April
15, 2022, as the minute order reflects that only Mr. Zakari appeared in person,
for a reduction of 2.8, or an additional $1400. 
The court disallows time spent on May 25 and May 29 as excessive and
duplicative given Mr. Zakari’s work preparing for trial, for a further
reduction of 8.4 hours, or $4200.  The
court finds the remaining request for fees to be reasonably incurred and
supported by the evidentiary record submitted, or a total of $63,890.
 
            Zakari
Billing Records and Hours 
 
As
stated above, the work on the summary judgment was excessive and
duplicative.  The court disallows all but
ten hours of work by Mr. Zakari on the summary judgment opposition, reducing
his hours by 11.8 hours or, $5900.  The
court also disallows as duplicative time spent by Mr. Zakari on the preparation
for and attendance at the deposition of the plaintiff.  Mr. Marchetti also billed for that same
work.  The court disallows 8.4 of work by
Mr. Zakari on these tasks on January 27, 28 and February 9, or a total of
$4200.   The court disallows 1.4 hours
spent on the deposition of Service Master as duplicative of work performed by
Mr. Marchetti, or $700.   The court
disallows 2 hours spent on “trial binders,” trial prep work with client “on the
details of the story” (5 hours), final prep with the client of 3.5 hours on May
29, 2022, a court appearance on May 31 (2 hours), waiting in court for the jury
verdict (6 hours) and 6.4 hours for reviewing the opposition and preparing a
reply to this attorney fee motion, or a reduction of $12450. The total
reduction to the hours of Mr. Zakari is $23,250. The court finds the remaining request for fees to be reasonably incurred
and supported by the evidentiary record submitted, or a total of $52,400.
 
Chen Hours
 
The
court awards no fees for the time allegedly spent by members of the Chen law
firm other than Mr. Chen, as he has provided no basis for the court to evaluate
their hourly rate.  Further, the court
has disallowed any charges where Mr. Chen’s and Susan Freedmon’s time was
intermixed with no distinction as to who was performing what task.  There are multiple examples of this occurring
in the billing records.  The court
therefore reduces the request for fees by 117.1 hours, or $35,130, due to this
unorthodox and unjustifiable billing practice. 
In addition, the court finds much of the work to be duplicative and
excessive. The court disallows the following work by Mr. Chen: 1.5 hours from
the May 4, 2019 bill ($450); 1.3 hours from the 6/4/09 bill ($330); 1.1 hours
form the 7/4/09 bill ($330); .9 hours from the 10/4/09 bill ($270); 2.9 hours
from the 12/04/19 bill o($870); 4.9 hours from the 1/4/20 bill ($1470); 2.9
hours from the 2/4/20 bill ($870); 1.9 hours from the 3/4/20 bill ($570); 1.1
from the 4/4/20 bill ($330); .9 hours from the 5/4/20 bill $270); 2 hours from
the 6/4/20 bill ($600); 1.1 from the 7/4/20 bill ($330);  3.4 hours from the 8/4/20 bill ($1020); .3
from the 9/4/20 bill ($90); 1.3 from the October 5, 2020 bill ($390); ten hours
from the 12/1/20 bill ($3000); 5 hours from the 2/4/21 bill ($1500); .5 from
the 3/4/21 bill ($150); 1.8 hours billed on August 4, 2021 ($540); 1.8 hours
billed on August 9, 2021 ($540).  The
total amount of fees disallowed is $47,250. 
The court finds the remaining request for fees to be reasonably incurred
and supported by the evidentiary record submitted, or a total of $35,430.
 
 
CONCLUSION
 
The court grants
plaintiff’s fee request in the amount of $151,720.
