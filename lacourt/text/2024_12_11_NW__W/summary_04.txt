And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Ross Morgan & Company, Inc. and Mont Calabasas Association, have filed a demurrer to the complaint of plaintiff Marcella Halprin. The demurrer argues that the complaint fails to state sufficient facts for any cause of action against the defendants and is uncertain. The court agrees with the demurrer and sustains it without leave to amend.

The defendants argue that the CC&Rs (Covenant, Conditions and Restrictions) for Mont Calabasas do not provide warranty for security, and that the Security and Privacy Disclaimer in the CC&Rs states that access gates and staffing are not intended to provide security or privacy. The court agrees that the plaintiff was on notice that no security would be provided or warranted.

The defendants also argue that they are not liable for the criminal conduct of third parties, and that the plaintiff fails to allege a special relationship between the parties. The court agrees that the plaintiff fails to allege any facts that the criminal conduct was reasonably foreseeable.

Finally, the defendants argue that the cause of action fails because the only allegation occurring on property controlled by the defendants is the existence of a parked vehicle on an access road, and the actual alleged criminal conduct occurred on the plaintiff's property, which is not controlled by the defendants. The court agrees that there are no allegations supporting a claim for premises liability.

Therefore, the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, and the case will proceed no further.
