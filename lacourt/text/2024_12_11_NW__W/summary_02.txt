Significant Statements:
  - "When the plaintiff is ignorant of the name of a defendant, he must state that fact in the complaint . . . and when his true name is discovered, the pleading or proceeding must be amended accordingly." (Code of Civ. Proc., ยง 474)
  - "For this rule to apply, it is necessary that the plaintiff actually be ignorant of the name or identity of the fictitiously named defendant at the time the complaint is filed. . . The phrase 'when the plaintiff is ignorant of the name of a defendant' . . . has not been interpreted liberally. It includes situations where the plaintiff 'knew the identity of the person but was ignorant of the facts giving him a cause of action against the person, or knew the name and all of the facts but was unaware that the law gave him a cause of action against the fictitiously named defendant and discovered that right by reason of decisions rendered after commencement of the action . . .'" (Hazel v. Hewlett (1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 1458, 1464)
  - "Unreasonable delay in filing a Doe amendment after plaintiff discovers the defendant's true identity may be grounds to bar the amendment if the defendant was prejudiced by the delay." (A.N. v. County of Los Angeles (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1058, 1067)
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Costco Wholesale Corporation's motion to strike the amendment to the complaint adding Doe defendant (Costco) on the grounds that the plaintiff was not truly ignorant of Costco's identity at the time the complaint was filed. The judge found that the plaintiff was aware of the alleged incident occurring in the Costco parking lot and had previously mentioned this in her own discovery requests and in responses from Defendant Sabag and Defendant Meehan. The judge also found that the plaintiff did not make a good faith effort to determine Costco's identity before filing the Doe amendment. The judge did not address whether the Doe amendment was proper, but instead denied the motion to strike, allowing Defendant Costco to later challenge the amendment on other grounds, such as statute of limitations.
