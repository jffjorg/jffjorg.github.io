And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted in part and denied in part the defendant's motion to compel further responses to form and special interrogatories. The defendant sought to compel responses to specific interrogatories, arguing that the plaintiff's prior responses were incomplete and lacked sufficient factual articulation. The judge found that the plaintiff's responses were incomplete and failed to address subparts or facts, and therefore granted the motion as to certain interrogatories.

However, the judge denied the motion as to other interrogatories, finding that the plaintiff had waived objections based on late service and that there was insufficient support for a waiver of constitutional privacy rights. The judge also denied the motion as to certain special interrogatories, finding that the defendant had failed to comply with the requirement to serve a declaration for necessity to serve additional special interrogatories.

The judge ordered the plaintiff to serve supplemental responses to certain interrogatories without objection within 30 days. The judge also imposed sanctions in the amount of $250, payable jointly and severally against the plaintiff and his counsel. The judge reserved the right to appoint a discovery referee if voluminous discovery constitutes a burden to court resources.
