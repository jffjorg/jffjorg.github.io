FURTHER FORM & SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant, Louis Franco
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff, Efren Mendez
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form and Special
Interrogatories
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION
On March 8, 2022, plaintiff Efren Mendez was involved in
an automobile collision with a vehicle operated by Defendant Louis Franco. On March
4, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint without any identified cause of action.
 
RULING: Granted in Part/Denied in Part.
Defendant Louis Franco moves to compel further responses
to Form Interrogatories (set one), numbers 7.3, 9.1, 12.1, 12.6, 17.1, 20.3,
20.4, 20.8, 20.11, and Special Interrogatories (set one), numbers 18, 28, and
36-79 from Plaintiff Efren Mendez. The court electronic filing system shows no
opposition or reply at the time of the tentative ruling publication cutoff.
Defendant filed a notice of non-opposition as well.
 
Defendant moves on grounds that the late responses
constituted a waiver of any objections, and when responses were late served,
said responses were incomplete. The motion was timely served exactly 45 days
from the date of service of the responses. 
 
On form interrogatories numbers 7.3, 9.1, 12.1, 12.6,
17.1, 20.3, 20.4, 20.8, 20.11, the court shows no objections, but the responses
remain incomplete in that Plaintiff only offers conclusive responses without
specific address of subparts or facts. (Code Civ. Proc., 2030.220; see Deyo
v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 783–784 [“Answers must be complete
and responsive. Thus, it is not proper to answer by stating, ‘See my
deposition’, ’See my pleading’, or ‘See the financial statement’”].) The
motion is granted as to the entire set.
 
The court also
finds the responses to the special interrogatories lacking sufficient factual
articulation. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.220.) Notwithstanding, while Plaintiff
waived objections based on late service, the court finds insufficient support
for a waiver of constitutionally protected privacy rights or a compelling basis
for production over these particular objections. The motion also lacks proof of
service of a declaration for necessity to serve additional special
interrogatories beyond the 35 item maximum. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030)
Again, the court declines to find a waiver of this objection in that Defendant
was required to comply with the requirement before any service. The motion is
therefore granted as to number 18 only, and denied as to numbers 28, and 36-79.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to serve supplemental responses without
objection to Form Interrogatories (set one), numbers 7.3, 9.1, 12.1,
12.6, 17.1, 20.3, 20.4, 20.8, 20.11, and Special Interrogatories, number 18,
without objections, within 30 days of this order. The motion is denied as to
the remainder.
 
Sanctions in the amount of $250. (Code Civ. Proc., §§2030.300,
subd. (d).) Sanctions imposed joint and severally against both counsel and Plaintiff
Efren Mende,
and payable within 30 days of this order. 
 
Next sets of
further discovery motions set for February 11, and 18, 2025, respectively. The
court reserves the right to appoint a discovery referee if voluminous discovery
constitutes a burden to court resources.
 
Moving party to
give notice.
