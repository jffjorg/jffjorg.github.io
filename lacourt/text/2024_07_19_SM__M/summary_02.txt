The court has reviewed the proposed minors compromise between Time Wallach, a minor, and Providence Saint John's Health Center, and has decided to approve the settlement. The settlement amount is $1,143,136.11, with $800,000.69 to be invested in a single-premium deferred annuity and $100,000.00 to be transferred to a trust. The court believes the fee request of $243,135.42, which is approximately 21.26% of the recovery, to be reasonable. The court sets an OSC (Order to Show Cause) re compliance/proof of receipt of deposit on September 24, 2024, at 8:30 AM. The parties are ordered to give notice, and no appearance is required if the receipt is filed.
