And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to a request for production of documents (RPD) from General Motors LLC. The plaintiff, Cristina Amaya, is seeking discovery related to the issuance of recalls and technical service bulletins (TSBs) for the 2019 Chevrolet Bolt EV, which she leased in June 2019.

The judge has denied the motion as to RPD nos. 28-29, which seek all documents that refer to or concern "policies and procedures" for the issuance of recalls and TSBs. The judge finds that this request is overbroad and unduly burdensome, and that it does not relate to the specific allegations in the case.

The judge has also granted the motion as to RPD nos. 37-60, 77-86, but with modifications. These RPDs seek documents related to the issuance of recalls and TSBs for other makes and models of vehicles. The judge finds that this request is overbroad as phrased, but that it may be permissible if limited to documents related to the specific battery defect in the plaintiff's vehicle and only those vehicles sold in California.

The judge has also noted that RPD no. 77, which concerns only the subject vehicle, is permissible without modification. Overall, the judge's ruling limits the scope of discovery to only those documents that are relevant and reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
