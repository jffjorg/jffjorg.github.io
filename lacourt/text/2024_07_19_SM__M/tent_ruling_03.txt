Legal
Standard
 
            In the absence of contrary court
order, a civil litigant’s right to discovery is broad. “[A]ny party may obtain
discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject
matter involved in the pending action . . . if the matter either is itself
admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence.” (CCP § 2017.010; see Davies v. Superior Court (1984)
36 Cal.3d 291, 301.) Section 2017.020(a) vests the Court with authority to
limit the scope of discovery if the burden, expense, or intrusiveness of the discovery
sought “clearly outweighs the likelihood that the information sought will lead
to the discovery of admissible evidence.” 
CCP § 2019.030 directs the Court to consider the needs of the case,
amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the
litigation, and to consider whether the discovery being sought is unreasonably
cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable by a more convenient or less
expensive or less burdensome way, when deciding whether to restrict the
frequency of extent of use of an authorized discovery method.
 
            If a party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely
response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling response to
the demand. (CCP § 2031.300(b); see Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403-404.) However, when responses are served, the proper
motion is a motion to compel further responses, which is governed by CCP §§
2030.300 and 2031.310. A motion to compel further responses must set forth
specific facts showing “good cause” justifying the discovery sought by the
demand and must be accompanied by a declaration showing a “reasonable and good
faith attempt” to resolve the issues outside of court. (CCP §§ 2016.040,
2031.310(b)(2).) 
 
            A motion to compel further responses
to a demand for inspection or production of documents may be brought based on:
(1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive or incomplete
claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized
objections. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(c).) A motion
for order compelling further responses “shall set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.” (CCP §
2031.310(b)(1).) Absent a claim of privilege or attorney work product, the
moving party meets its burden of showing good cause by a fact-specific showing
of relevance. (See Kirkland v.
Superior Court (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.) If the moving party
has shown good cause for the RPDs, the burden is on the objecting party to
justify the objections. (Ibid.)  
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiff Cristina Amaya moves for
an order to compel Defendant General Motors LLC’s further responses and
production of documents to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents (Set
One) Nos. 28-29, 37-60, 77-86.
 
RPD nos. 28-29
 
These RPDs seek all documents which
refer, relate to or concern “policies and procedures” for the issuance of “recalls”
and “technical service bulletins.” The Court concurs with GM’s objections that
this request is overbroad and responding to the request would be unduly
burdensome. 
 
The categories must be reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence in light of the
claims pled here. This lemon law action arises out of Plaintiff’s June 2019
lease of a new 2019 Chevrolet Bolt EV, which was manufactured by Defendant. To
prevail on a lemon law claim, a plaintiff must prove: (1) a nonconformity with
a vehicle that substantially impaired its use, value or safety; (2)
presentation of the vehicle to the manufacturer or authorized representative
for repair; and (3) failure to repair the nonconformity after a reasonable
number of attempts. (Oregel v. Am. Isuzu Motors, Inc., (2001) 90
Cal.App.4th 1094.) A “manufacturer has an affirmative duty to replace a vehicle
or to make restitution to the buyer if the manufacturer is unable to repair the
new vehicle after a reasonable number of repair attempts[.]” (Lukather v.
General Motors, LLC, (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 1041, 1050.) Willful failure to
comply with that duty subjects a manufacturer to a civil penalty of up to twice
the amount of actual damages. (Civ. Code § 1794(c).) The operative FAC alleges
that GM intentionally and knowingly concealed certain material facts regarding a
defective high voltage battery pack in the Vehicle. (FAC ¶¶8-10.) Despite
Plaintiff’s repeated presentations of the subject vehicle to authorized repair
facilities, Defendant did not conform the Vehicle to the express warranties, and
it remains in a defective condition. (FAC ¶¶ 24, 56-92.) 
 
Plaintiff claims that Defendant had
knowledge of the battery defect in the subject 2019 Bolt, posing a safety risk
of fire. Plaintiff argues that GM’s general policies and procedures regarding
the issuance of recall notices and TSBs would reveal documents which are
probative on Defendant’s inability to repair Plaintiff’s vehicle, and its knowledge
of such inability to repair. However, the category does not seek documents
which would show GM’s knowledge of a specific defect. Rather, the requests seek
documents which relate in any way to policies and procedures for issuing
recalls or TSBs, which stray well beyond the relevant policies and procedures. Moreover,
this RPD is unbounded in time, and does not directly relate to GM’s knowledge
of the alleged battery defect in 2019 Bolts, or policies and procedures in
effect at the time of purchase. No further responses are required. Accordingly,
the motion is DENIED as to RPD nos. 28-29.
 
RPD nos. 37-60, 77-86
 
GM objects to these requests
principally on the grounds that documents pertaining to vehicles other than the
subject Vehicle would be irrelevant and discovery on such vehicles is not
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. GM
argues that providing documents concerning not just Plaintiff’s vehicle, but
information concerning other consumers’ vehicles, would be overbroad in the
context of the warranty claims in this case, and unduly burdensome to GM. 
 
The Court concurs that the above
RPDs are overbroad as phrased. Generally, the Court would permit discovery on Defendant’s
knowledge of the battery defect in Plaintiff’s 2019 Chevy Bolt, which would
include some of the documents sought by RPD nos. 37-60, 78-86. As
phrased, however, the RPDs go beyond the pled battery defect in Plaintiff’s subject
vehicle. Discovery on similar defects in other makes/models of
vehicles is not reasonably likely to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence concerning Defendant’s knowledge of the pled battery defects in the
subject 2019 Bolt. Properly limited to the subject make/model and geographic
location, the categories of documents may reveal the extent of Defendant’s
knowledge of these defects at the time of Plaintiff’s purchase. The Court will
therefore limit the above RPDs to permit discovery only as to alleged battery
defect (and related systems) present in 2019 Chevy Bolts, and only those vehicles
sold in California. 
 
The Court notes one exception, RPD
no. 77, which concerns only the subject vehicle, and is therefore permissible
without modification.
 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED
as to RPD no. 77, and GRANTED as modified as to RPD nos. 37-60, 78-86.
