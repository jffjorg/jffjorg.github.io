And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting a motion to be relieved as counsel for defendant Gerald Vaccerello, Trustee of the G&B Vaccerello Trust. The attorney, Brianna Milligan, and her law firm, Geraci Law Firm, are seeking to withdraw due to an irreparable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. The attorney served the client by mail at his last known address, which was confirmed within the past 30 days. Since the trial is not until October 14, 2024, the judge does not find that the client will be prejudiced by the withdrawal. The judge orders the motion to be granted.
