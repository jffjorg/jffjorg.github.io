And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling in this case is that the settlement between the Plaintiff and the Settling Defendants was made in good faith. The settlement was reached on a "walkaway" basis with "no financial consideration trading hands", and the settling parties agreed to release all claims between them. The Judge notes that the burden is on the Defendants to show that the settlement was not made in good faith, and since they have failed to meet this burden, their motion to contest the good faith of the settlement cannot be granted. The Judge also denies the Defendants' request for a continuance to conduct discovery on the Settling Defendants' proportionate liability, as they have not made a sufficient showing of why such discovery is necessary.
