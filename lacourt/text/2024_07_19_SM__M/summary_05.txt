The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to respond to discovery requests, including special interrogatories, form interrogatories, and a demand for production of documents. The plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests within the original due date, and the defendant properly served the requests by mail on January 19, 2024. The judge finds that the plaintiff has failed to show substantial justification for their failure to respond and awards sanctions of $2,280.00. The plaintiff is ordered to serve further responses to the discovery requests without objection within 20 days.
