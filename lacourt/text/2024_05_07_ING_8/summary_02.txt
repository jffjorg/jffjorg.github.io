And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the Defendants' Motion to Compel Arbitration and stays the civil action pending the conclusion of the arbitration. The Arbitration Agreement between Menzies Aviation, Inc. and its employees, including Plaintiff Angela Tamara Seminario, appears to cover the allegations present in the Complaint. The Court finds that Defendants have met their initial burden of showing that an arbitration agreement exists between the parties and that the agreement satisfies the Armendariz requirements. As a result, the Court grants the motion and stays the proceedings against Defendants pending the conclusion of the arbitration.
