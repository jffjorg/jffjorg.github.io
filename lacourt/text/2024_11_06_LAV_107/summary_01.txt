And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel deposition questions filed by the plaintiff, Theresa Valencia. The plaintiff was injured in a trip and fall at a restaurant called House of Galbi, and she has filed a premises liability action against the restaurant and its owners. The plaintiff deposed a witness named Yun Hwan Kim on September 9, 2024, and later filed a motion to compel the witness to answer certain deposition questions.

The defendants argued that the plaintiff did not adequately meet and confer with them before filing the motion, and that the plaintiff's counsel only made a brief inquiry during the deposition about the basis for the defendants' objection to the questions. The judge found that the plaintiff's counsel did not make a "serious effort at negotiation and informal resolution" as required by California law, and therefore denied the motion to compel.

The judge's ruling means that the plaintiff will not be able to compel the witness to answer the disputed deposition questions, and the case will proceed without the answers to those questions.
