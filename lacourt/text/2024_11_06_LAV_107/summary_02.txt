And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Plaintiff's counsel, Norma Jimenez. The motion was filed on October 10, 2024, and no opposition was filed.

The judge found that the motion did not comply with the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, which requires that the motion be accompanied by a declaration stating the reasons for the motion, and that the notice of motion and motion be served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case.

The judge also found that the proposed order relieving counsel was not prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel-Civil (form MC-053) and was not lodged with the court with the moving papers.

The judge noted that the plaintiff's counsel had attempted to explain the MC-050 form to the plaintiff, but the plaintiff failed to sign it despite multiple attempts by the counsel to clarify the form. The judge also found that the plaintiff had exhibited a consistent lack of effective communication regarding the case, including withholding pertinent information and displaying erratic and inappropriate behavior.

The judge concluded that the motion was denied because it did not comply with the requirements of the rules and because the proposed order relieving counsel was not prepared or served as required.
