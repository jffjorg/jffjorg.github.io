And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

In this case, the plaintiff, Maria Sanchez Rubio, sued Bodega Latina Corporation and others for negligence and premises liability after she slipped and fell in their store. The defendant moved for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiff could not establish her causes of action. The court denied the motion, finding that there were triable issues of material fact as to whether the defendant had constructive notice of the slippery substance on the floor.

The court noted that the surveillance video footage showed a child in the area where the plaintiff fell, and that another person was seen drinking from a can 22 minutes before the incident. The court found that a reasonable inference could be drawn that the person drinking spilled the liquid on the floor, and that this created a triable issue of fact as to whether the defendant had constructive notice of the liquid.

The court also found that the parties disagreed about the nature of the substance that the plaintiff slipped on, with the defendant claiming it was a milky substance and the plaintiff claiming it was milk or water. The court noted that these were conflicting pieces of evidence that must be resolved by a jury.

In summary, the court denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that there were triable issues of material fact that required a jury trial to resolve.
