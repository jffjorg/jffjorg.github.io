And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, US Floor Designs Inc., has filed a motion for leave to file an amended answer alleging settlement as an additional affirmative defense. The settlement was reached between the defendant's insurance company, NGIC, and the plaintiff, Sara Melgar, prior to litigation. However, the plaintiff filed the complaint despite the settlement agreement. The defendant argues that it was unaware of the defense when it filed the answer. The court has reviewed the proposed amended answer and finds that it complies with the relevant rules of court. The court exercises its discretion liberally in favor of amendments and grants the motion for leave to file the amended answer. The amended answer must be filed within 10 days of this order, and the moving party is ordered to give notice.
