The Complaint alleges as follows.  In 2013, Plaintiff Ben Niakan (“Niakan”), on behalf of the Niakan Family Partnership (the “Partnership” and together with Niakan, “Plaintiffs”) entered into an agreement with Defendants ASES Electrical Group (“ASES”) and Daniel Nazarian (“Nazarian”, and together with ASES “Defendants”) to install solar systems on the Partnership’s properties. (Compl. ¶ 9.)  As part of the agreement, Defendants were to repay Plaintiffs for Plaintiffs’ initial investment. (Compl. ¶ 19.) Defendants have stopped providing these payments to Plaintiffs, despite owing in excess of $60,000. (Compl. ¶ 20.) PROCEDURAL HISTORYOn January 21, 2021, Plaintiffs filed the Complaint asserting three causes of action: 1. Breach of Written Contract; 2. Unjust Enrichment; and 3. Fraud. On November 21, 2022, this case was consolidated with case number 21STCV06702.On August 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Consolidated Complaint (“FAC”) adding causes of action for negligent misrepresentation, quasi-contract, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, money had and received, fraud by concealment, and violation of Bus. & Professions Code, section 17200. On May 6, 2022, Defendant Nazarian filed the instant motions to compel Plaintiff the Niakan Family Partnership’s (“Partnership’s”) further responses to Requests for Production (“RPDs”) and Requests for Admissions (“RFAs”). Plaintiff did not oppose the motions. The motions were originally  filed in the non-lead case.On August 14, 2023, Nazarian re-filed the motions to compel further in the lead case.DISCUSSIONI. Legal StandardUnder Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, the Court may order a responding party to serve a further response to a request for production when the Court finds that any of the following apply: 1. A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete; 2. A representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. 3. An objection in the response is without merit or too general. To prevail, the party moving for the order must first offer specific facts demonstrating “good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) This burden “is met simply by a fact-specific showing of relevance.” (TBG Ins. Servs. Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.) If “good cause” is shown by the moving party, the burden shifts to the responding party to justify any objections made to document disclosure. (Kirkland v. Superior Court (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.) A party to whom requests for admission have been directed must respond in writing under oath separately to each request. (Code Civ. Proc., section 2033.210(a).) A party may respond to a request for admission by answering that the party admits or denies the matter involved in the request. (Code Civ. Proc., section 2032.210(b).)(a) On receipt of a response to requests for admissions, the party requesting admissions may move for an order compelling a further response if that party deems that either or both of the following apply:(1) An answer to a particular request is evasive or incomplete(2) An objection to a particular request is without merit or too general.(Code Civ. Proc., section 2033.290(a).)Unless notice of the motion to compel a further response is given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or any specific later date to which the parties have agreed in writing, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response. (Code Civ. Proc., sections 2031.310(c), 2030.300(c), 2033.290(c).)  Failure to timely move to compel within the specified period constitutes a waiver of any right to compel a further response. The 45–day rule to bring a motion to compel is mandatory and jurisdictional “in the sense that it renders court without authority to rule on motions to compel other than to deny them.” (Sexton v. Superior Ct. (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  II. DiscussionDefendant Nazarian seeks orders compelling Plaintiff Partnership to serve further responses to RPDs and RFAs.Nazarian’s counsel testifies that he propounded written discovery requests on Partnership on August 27, 2021. (Ramirez Decl., ¶3.) Partnership’s counsel requested extensions between September 2021 and October 2021, the most recent of which extending the response deadline for the RFAs to November 15, 2021 and extending the response deadline for the RPDs to October 29, 2021. (Id., ¶¶5-9.) Partnership served responses to RFAs on November 15, 2021. (Id., ¶9.) Partnership served late responses to RPDs only on November 22, 2021. (Id., ¶10.) Nazarian’s counsel sent meet and confer correspondence to Partnership’s counsel regarding the outstanding discovery requests on December 15, 2021. (Id., ¶11.) Partnership’s counsel responded on December 20, 2021 and did not address the outstanding discovery. (Id., ¶13.) After many failed meet and confer attempts, the parties agreed in writing on April 1, 2022 that Partnership would supplement its responses to RFAs 1, 9, 54, 55, 58, 59, 62, 66, 67, and 86 of Nazarian’s RFAs by April 29, 2022. (Id., ¶30.) Partnership would also serve additional documents responsive to the RPDs on the dame date. (Id.) Partnership did not serve the responses as promised. (Id., ¶32.) On May 2, 2022 Nazarian’s counsel received an email from Partnership’s counsel stating Partnership was considering associating new counsel. (Id., ¶33.) On May 3, 2022, Nazarian’s counsel requested an extension on the deadline to file a motion to compel further responses. (Id., ¶34.) Nazarian’s counsel never received a response. (Id., ¶35.)The parties agreed to extend the deadline for Partnership to serve supplemental responses to RPDs and RFAs to April 29, 2022. Nazarian’s deadline to file a motion to compel further was June 13, 2022. Nazarian’s motions were timely filed on May 6, 2022.a. RFAsNazarian seeks further responses to RFA numbers 1, 9, 54, 55, 58, 59, 62, 66, 67, and 86 on the grounds that the responses are evasive and incomplete. The requests ask Partnership to admit or deny the following:1. Admit that the SOLAR SYSTEM was installed by ASES at 707 RIDGEWOOD.9. Admit that the SOLAR SYSTEM installed by ASES at 707 RIDGEWOOD is operating.54. Admit that ASES acquired the necessary permits to install the SOLAR SYSTEM at 707 RIDGEWOOD.55. Admit that ASES acquired the necessary permits to install the SOLAR SYSTEM at 713 RIDGEWOOD.58. Admit that ASES passed all inspections performed by LADWP RELATED TO the SOLAR SYSTEM at 707 RIDGEWOOD.59. Admit that ASES passed all inspections performed by LADWP RELATED TO the SOLAR SYSTEM at 713 RIDGEWOOD.62. Admit that ASES passed all inspections performed by LADBS RELATED TO the SOLAR SYSTEM at 707 RIDGEWOOD.66. Admit that YOU received a citation from the City of Los Angeles in or after 2009 RELATED TO 707 RIDGEWOOD.67. Admit that YOU received a citation from the City of Los Angeles in or after 2009 RELATED TO 713 RIDGEWOOD.To each of these requests, Partnership responded: “Unable to admit or deny, therefore denies.”Nazarian argues that the responses are evasive because they are not straightforward and cannot be reconciled. By hedging the answer with an inability to respond and then providing a response, Nazarian cannot know whether the matter is denied as untrue or whether it is denied because Partnership cannot admit or deny due to lack of information.Code Civ. Proc., section 2033.220 provides that each answer to an RFA shall be as complete and straightforward as the information reasonably available to the responding party permits. Additionally, each answer shall:(1) Admit so much of the matter involved in the request as is true, either as expressed in the request itself or as reasonably and clearly qualified by the responding party.(2) Deny so much of the matter involved in the request as is untrue.(3) Specify so much of the matter involved in the request as to the truth of which the responding party lacks sufficient information or knowledge.(c) If a responding party gives lack of information or knowledge as a reason for a failure to admit all or part of a request for admission, that party shall state in the answer that a reasonable inquiry concerning the matter in the particular request has been made, and that the information known or readily obtainable is insufficient to enable that party to admit the matter.Here, Partnership’s responses are unreasonably qualified because they do not clearly state whether the matters are denied as untrue or due to a lack of information. If Partnership is unable to admit or deny due to a lack of information, Partnership was required to state what reasonable inquiry concerning the matter was made and the information known or readily obtainable is insufficient to enable that Partnership to admit the matter. The responses are thus evasive or incomplete. Nazarian’s motion to compel further responses to RFAs is granted.b. RPDsNazarian seeks further responses to RPDs numbers 1-8, 47-52, 61-64, 77-90, 99, 109, 115-118, 121-130, 135-138, 141, 142, 145, 146, 150, 151, 155-158, 159, 164-168, 174, 175, 179, 180, 184-187, 203-204, 208-209, 213-216, 239-246, 267-290, 292.Nazarian first argues that Partnership’s objections to these requests were waived because the responses were untimely.A party waives its objections to a discovery request when it does not serve a timely response to the request. (Code Civ. Proc., section 2030.290(a)) Even if objections do not need to be verified, objections will be waived if the responding party “fails to file any response within the statutory time period.” (Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 651, 658.)The Court finds that all objections are waived except objections based on attorney-client or work product privileges. However, if those privileges are asserted, Partnership must provide a privilege log.Partnership’s original deadline to serve responses to RPDs was November 15, 2021. Partnership served responses on November 22, 2021. The parties agreed on new a deadline of April 29, 2022 for Partnership to serve supplemental responses. Partnership failed to serve supplemental responses. Because Partnership’s responses were late even according to the original deadline, Partnership’s objections are waived. Nazarian’s Exhibit 8, though labeled as Partnership’s responses to RPDs, is another copy of Partnership’s responses to RFAs. However, Nazarian copied the responses in the separate statement.Requests 1-8, 47, 48, 49, 50: These requests seek communications between Partnership, Ases, LADWP and Nazarian since 2009 and communications between Partnership, Ases, Nazarian, Bijan, LADWP, and Betty related to the solar system since 2009. Nazarian also requests all communications between Partnership and LADWP pertaining to solar rebate and the FIT Program.To each request, Partnership responded “Responding Party will produce all non-privileged, responsive documents, to the extent any exist, at a mutually agreeable date, time and location.” Nazarian argues the responses are incomplete because they failed to identify the documents responsive to each specific request as required by Code Civ. Proc., section 2031.280(a). The requests were properly limited in time after the events giving rise to this action. Additionally, communications between these parties are relevant to the merits of Partnership’s claims because each party was involved in the dispute over whether Ases installed the solar panels as promised, whether Defendants misrepresented the value of LADWP’s solar rebate, whether the solar panels would qualify for the FIT program as alleged in the FAC (FAC ¶¶123, 2). The Court finds that good cause exists for the discovery of these documents.Partnership must identify the documents with the specific number requests to which the documents respond as required by Code Civ. Proc., section 2031.280(a).  Requests 51-52: These requests seek documents and communications related to payments Partnership received from LADWP from 2009 to present. Partnership responded “Responding Party has made a diligent search of its records and has no documents which are responsive to this Request.”Nazarian argues that the response is incomplete because it does not state whether the inability to comply is because the particular item or category has never existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding party as required by Code Civ. Proc., section 2030.230. Additionally, the response fails to set forth the name and address of the person or organization believed to be in possession of the documents. Because Partnership’s response fails to provide all the information required by Code Civ. Proc., section 2030.230, the motion is granted as to these requests.Requests 61-64: These requests seek documents and communications related to any tax credits Partnership received from the IRS and the State of California since 2009 for the solar panels. Partnership’s responses to requests 61 and 62 state “Objection Right of Privacy, Attorney Client privilege, Attorney Work product Privilege. Without waiving said objections, Responding Party will produce relevant communications related to those portions of relevant tax returns that make reference to IRS tax credits.”As discussed above, Partnership’s objections are waived because the responses were untimely. In any case, the documents are relevant to whether Defendants misrepresented the benefits of installing solar panels as alleged in the FAC. (FAC ¶49.) Because the objections are waived, Partnership must serve responsive documents.Partnership’s responses to requests 63 and 64 state “Responding Party will produce all non-privileged, responsive documents, to the extent any exist, at a mutually agreeable date, time and location.” Partnership must provide further responses to these requests for the same reasons as requests numbers 51 and 52. Requests 77-86: These requests seek Partnership’s federal and state tax returns from 2009 to present, Bijan’s tax returns, Betty Niakan’s tax returns, Fatolah Niakan’s tax returns, and Behzad Niakan’s tax returns. To each request, Partnership responded “Objection Right of Privacy, Attorney Client privilege, Attorney Work product Privilege. The Request seeks information that is overly broad and not calculated to discover relevant and admissible evidence.” The motion is granted with respect to these requests for the same reasons as requests 61 and 62.Requests 87-90, 266: These requests seek documents, communications, and accounting ledgers related to payments Partnership made to Ases and Nazarian since 2009. To each request, Partnership responded “Responding Party will produce all non-privileged, responsive documents, to the extent any exist, at a mutually agreeable date, time and location.” Partnership must provide further responses to these requests because the request is relevant to Partnership’s damages against Ases and Nazarian. Requests 99 and 109: These requests seek communications from Partnership and Bijan to tenants at the Wilshire property related to the installation of the solar panels since 2009. Partnership responded “Responding Party will produce all non-privileged, responsive documents, to the extent any exist, at a mutually agreeable date, time and location.”This information is relevant to whether Defendants made misrepresentations to Partnership’s tenants that the solar panels would reduce their expenses as alleged in the FAC. (FAC ¶¶106-107.) Requests 115-116, 121-122, 150-151, 179-180, 208-209: These requests seek electricity bills Partnership received since 2009. Partnership responded “Responding Party will produce all non-privileged, responsive documents, to the extent any exist, at a mutually agreeable date, time and location.” Again, this information is relevant to whether Defendants misrepresented the benefits of installing solar panels. Requests 117-118, 145-146, 174-175, 203-204: These requests seek communications between Plaintiff’s and Bijan’s communications with other solar companies besides Asses since 2009. Partnership responded “Responding Party will produce all non-privileged, responsive documents, to the extent any exist, at a mutually agreeable date, time and location.” These communications are relevant to whether Plaintiff is in the process of hiring another solar contractor to replace Defendants’ faulty solar panels. (FAC ¶118.) Requests 123-125, 152-153: These requests seek any and all permits relating to installing the solar system at 707 Ridgewood and 713 Ridgewood since 2009. Plaintiff responded “The Responding Party objects to this request to the extent it provides an inadequate description of the requested documents, which prevents the Responding Party from identifying the documents to be produced. The Responding Party further objects on the grounds that the Request is overbroad, vague, ambiguous, and unduly burdensome and oppressive and not calculated to the discovery of relevant and admissible evidence. Without waiving said objections, Responding Party will product all non-privilege, responsive documents, to the extent any exist, at a mutually agreeable date, time and location.”This information is relevant to whether Partnership obtained the proper permits to install solar meters on Partnership’s property as alleged in the FAC. (FAC ¶119.) Although Plaintiff objected on the grounds that the requests are overbroad and unduly burdensome, objections were waived because the responses were untimely. Because objections are waived, Partnership must produce all responsive documents.Requests 126-130, 135-138, 141-142, 154-159, 164-168, 184-187, 213-216, 239-246: These requests seek information about the installation and inspection of solar panels on Partnership’s properties since 2009. To requests 126-130, 135-138, 141-142, 154-158, 184-187, 213-216, 241-245, Plaintiff responded Responding Party will produce all non-privileged, responsive documents, to the extent any exist, at a mutually agreeable date, time and location.” To requests 159, 164-168, 239-240, and 246 Plaintiff responded Responding Party has made a diligent search of its records and has no documents which are responsive to this Request.With respect to requests 126-130, 135-138, 141-142, 154-158, 184-187, 213-216, and 241-245 the information about the installation of solar panels at Partnership’s properties is directly relevant to Plaintiff’s claims that Defendants improperly installed solar panels at these properties. Because objections are waived, Partnership must produce all responsive documents. With respect to requests 159, 164-168, 239-240, and 246 the motion is granted for the same reasons as requests numbers 51 and 52.Requests 267-286: These requests seek information about maintenance and improvements to Partnership’s properties. To each request, Partnership responded “The Responding Party objects to this request to the extent it provides an inadequate description of the requested documents, which prevents the Responding Party from identifying the documents to be produced. The Responding Party further objects on the grounds that the Request is overbroad, vague, ambiguous, and unduly burdensome and oppressive and not calculated to the discovery of relevant and admissible evidence.”This information is relevant to whether Defendants properly installed solar panels on the properties and whether there were existing defects such as other improvements impeding Defendants’ work. Because objections are waived, Partnership must produce all responsive documents.Requests 287-288: These requests seek documents related to the identity of the Niakan Family Partnership and any person who had the authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the Niakan Family Partnership since 2009. Plaintiff responded “Responding Party will produce all non-privileged, responsive documents, to the extent any exist, at a mutually agreeable date, time and location.”The requested information is relevant to establish whether Defendants made representations to the Niakan family and which individuals were agents of the Niakan Family Partnership. Because objections are waived, Partnership must produce all responsive documents.Requests 289-290, 292: These requests seek electrical plans to the Ridgewood properties. Plaintiff responded “Responding Party has made a diligent search of its records and has no documents which are responsive to this Request.” The motion is granted for the same reasons as requests numbers 51 and 52.SanctionsWith respect to the Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Admission, Defendant Nazarian seeks sanctions in the amount of $6,381.65. With respect to the Motion to Compel Further Response to Request for Production, Defendant Nazarian seeks sanctions in the amount of $7,171.65.The hours requested are excessive given that no oppositions were filed and given that the motions has some similarities.Pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1348, the Court awards attorney’s fees at the rate of $395 per hour for 8 hours plus two filing fees in the amount of $61.65 each, for a total of $3,283.30. DATED:  October 27, 2023______________________Hon.
