Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Nazarian's motions to compel further responses to requests for admissions and requests for production. The Court grants the motions and orders Plaintiff Niakan Family Partnership to provide further responses to the requests. The Court also awards sanctions in the amount of $3,283.30 against Plaintiff Niakan Family Partnership and its counsel.

The dispute arises from a breach of contract action brought by Plaintiff Niakan Family Partnership against Defendant Nazarian and ASES Electrical Group. The parties entered into an agreement in 2013 to install solar systems on Plaintiff's properties, but Defendant Nazarian and ASES Electrical Group stopped providing payments to Plaintiff despite owing in excess of $60,000.

The Court finds that Plaintiff Niakan Family Partnership failed to provide timely responses to discovery requests and that Defendant Nazarian's motions are timely and justified. The Court orders Plaintiff Niakan Family Partnership to provide further responses to requests for admissions and requests for production, including identification of documents responsive to the requests.

The Court also awards sanctions against Plaintiff Niakan Family Partnership and its counsel in the amount of $3,283.30, which is calculated at a rate of $395 per hour for 8 hours plus two filing fees. The Court finds that the hours requested are excessive given that no oppositions were filed and given that the motions have some similarities.
