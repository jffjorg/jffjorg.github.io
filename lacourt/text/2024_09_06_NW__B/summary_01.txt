And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of the defendant, Avis Budget Car Rental, LLC, granting their motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The ruling states that the defendant has met its initial burden for summary judgment by showing that it did not engage in negligence or criminal wrongdoing when renting the vehicle at issue. The judge finds that the plaintiff, James Kay, has not presented any evidence to contradict the defendant's claims and that there are no triable issues of fact regarding the defendant's vicarious liability.

The ruling is based on the Graves Amendment, which preempts all state statutory and common law to the extent those laws hold owners in the business of renting or leasing motor vehicles vicariously liable for the negligence of drivers, except when there is negligence or criminal wrongdoing on the part of the owner. The defendant has presented evidence that it complied with the requirements of the California Vehicle Code, including the requirement to ensure the facial validity of a rental customer's driver's license before entrusting the car to the renter.

The judge has also ruled that the plaintiff's opposition to the defendant's motion is without merit, as the plaintiff's evidence is insufficient to raise a triable issue of fact regarding the defendant's vicarious liability.
