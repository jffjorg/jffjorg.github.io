And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' request for entry of default judgment and dismissed the complaint against the defendant without prejudice. The plaintiffs had sought damages of $100,313.59 for injuries and property loss resulting from a collision with the defendant's vehicle on April 13, 2021. However, the judge found that the plaintiffs had failed to file the required documents and had repeatedly failed to obtain default judgment due to procedural and filing deficiencies. The judge also noted that the action had been pending for over three years and had not yet been brought to trial, which was a basis for dismissing the case under California law. The judge reminded the plaintiffs to consult the California Rules of Court and to complete all applicable items on mandatory forms.
