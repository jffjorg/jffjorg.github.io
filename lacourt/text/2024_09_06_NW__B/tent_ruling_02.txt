and through their Guardian ad Litem Ronnie Springfellow (collectively
“Plaintiffs”), allege that Defendant Malic Love, recklessly operating his
vehicle, collided with Plaintiffs’ vehicle on April 13, 2021, resulting in loss
of property and injuries. Plaintiffs sued claiming damages in the amount of
$100,313.59 for (1) Motor Vehicle and (2) Negligence.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration
of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiffs
seeks damages in the amount of $100,313.59. Specifically, Plaintiffs seek
$74,999.00 in damages, $24,454.50 in prejudgment interest at the annual rate of
10%, and $860.09 in costs. 
 
Plaintiffs
failed to file CIV-100 to request court judgment. (CRC 3.1800(a).) The court must
deny a request for default judgment if movant failed to file this CIV-100. (Ibid.)
Plaintiffs did file form CIV-100 to enter default on November 28, 2023.
However, Plaintiffs must file form CIV-100 to request court judgment on the
entry of default.
 
The
Court also finds the following filing deficiencies:
 
1.       Plaintiff failed to dismiss all other parties, namely,
Does 3-50. (CRC 3.1800(a)(7).)
2.       Plaintiff’s Statement of Damages fails to allege
damages with certainty. (CRC 3.1800(a)(2).)
3.       Plaintiff failed to file a declaration supporting
alleged damages signed by Plaintiffs themselves. The declaration provided is by
Plaintiff’s counsel, and signed by Plaintiff’s counsel. (CRC 3.1800(a)(2).)
4.       Plaintiff failed to provide interest calculation. (CRC
3.1800(a)(3).)
 
 
The
Court has denied Plaintiffs’ request for entry of default judgment due to
filing deficiencies on three different occasions. The Court reminds Plaintiffs
to consult Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1800(a) for a list of mandatory documents
to be filed with a request for entry of default judgment, and to complete all
applicable items on mandatory forms.
 
Because
the Court finds Plaintiffs have not submitted filings required by CRC 3.1800(a),
the Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ request for entry of default judgment.
 
Plaintiffs have attempted,
and failed, to enter or obtain default judgment multiple times due to repeated
procedural and filing deficiencies under Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1800. These
instances are as follows:
 
·        
February
17, 2023, request for entry of default rejected (did not provide names of all
plaintiffs)
·        
July
11, 2023, request for entry of default rejected (plaintiffs’ names did not
match First Amended Complaint; mailing date not listed; no POS or filing of POS
on Statement of Damages)
·        
 October 4, 2023, request for entry of default
rejected (did not provide names of all plaintiffs; no POS on SOD)
·        
October
12, 2023, request for entry of default rejected (no POS on SOD; no proof of
mailing; #1e incomplete)
 
Plaintiffs’
most recent request for default judgment contains the following
deficiencies: (1) failed to
dismiss all other parties, (2) failed to allege damages with certainty, (3)
failed to file Plaintiffs’ declaration supporting alleged damages, and (4)
failed to provide interest calculation.  
Failure to Timely
Obtain Default Judgment
 
            Pursuant to CRC 3.110(h), the party who requested an
entry of default must obtain default judgment within 45 days after the default
was entered. The court may issue an order to show cause why sanctions should
not be imposed if that party fails to obtain default judgment within that time,
including terminating sanctions and dismissal of the action. 
 
Pursuant
to CCP § 583.410(a), the court may dismiss an action on its own motion if doing
so “appears appropriate under the circumstances of the case.” Dismissal shall
be appropriate pursuant to the procedure and criteria prescribed by rules
adopted by the Judicial Council. (CCP § 583.410(b).) The court may dismiss
pursuant to CCP § 583.140 if the action is not brought to trial within three
years after the action is commenced against the defendant. (CCP §
583.420(a)(2)(A).)
            
            Here, Plaintiffs’ Complaint naming Defendant was filed on
May 10, 2021. The action was commenced over three years ago and it has not yet
been brought to trial. Therefore, it is within the court’s discretion to
dismiss the case pursuant to CCP § 538.410 and CCP 583.420(a)(2)(A). 
 
            The Court exercises it’s discretion and dismisses the
Complaint against Defendant Malic Love without prejudice.
