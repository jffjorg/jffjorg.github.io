And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by Cross-Defendant DoorDash, Inc. is sustained with 30 days leave to amend. The demurrer was based on the grounds that Cross-Complainant Jorge Pantoja's entire cross-complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute any causes of action. The judge found that Cross-Complainant has not alleged any factual allegations against Cross-Defendant, and that the cross-complaint must be amended to cure the defects. The judge granted 30 days leave to amend the cross-complaint, and scheduled the case for a hearing on July 19, 2024.
