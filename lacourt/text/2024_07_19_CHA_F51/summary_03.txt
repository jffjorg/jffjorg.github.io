Summary in English text:

The tentative ruling states that the motion to disqualify Defendants' counsel is moot because the counsel has already been replaced. The Court notes that this does not prevent the Plaintiff from bringing a new motion to disqualify against the new counsel. The Court also warns that if a new motion is filed, it may significantly delay the case due to the Court's impacted calendar. The ruling is based on the Court's review of the motion and the parties' representations, including the Plaintiff's allegations of wrongdoing by Defendant Vladimirskaya and the Defendant's response.
