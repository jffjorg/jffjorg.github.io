And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the case. The ruling sustains the Demurrer in part and overrules it in part. The Judge denies the Motion to strike in part and grants it in part. The Judge grants leave to amend the complaint.

The Court has considered the Demurrer filed by the Defendants, MJ Global Enterprise, Inc. and Juni Espinosa, against the Plaintiff, Everytable, PBC's First Amended Complaint. The Demurrer argues that the complaint does not state a claim for relief and is uncertain.

The Judge has ruled that the First and Fifth Causes of Action for Breach of Contract are insufficient because the complaint fails to attach a copy of the written contract or plead all material terms of the contract. The Judge has also ruled that the Second Cause of Action for Fraud is sufficient, but the Plaintiff has failed to adequately allege fraud against Defendant Espinosa individually.

The Judge has overruled the Demurrer to the Third Cause of Action for Accounting and the Fourth Cause of Action for Declaratory Relief. The Judge has denied the Motion to strike two portions of the complaint relating to punitive damages, but has granted the Motion to strike as to Defendant Espinosa.

The Judge has granted leave to amend the complaint, allowing the Plaintiff to re-file the complaint with additional information.
