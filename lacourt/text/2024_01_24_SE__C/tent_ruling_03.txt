 Case Number:  22NWCV01237    Hearing Date:   January 24, 2024    Dept:  C Maria Ramirez vs Ford Motor Company, et al., Case No.
22NWCV01237
In this lemon law case, Defendants Ford Motor Company and
Norm Reeves Ford Superstore apply ex parte for an Order to Dismiss the entire
action due to Plaintiff Maria Ramirez’s failure to amend her First Amended
Complaint following the Court sustaining Defendants’ Demurrer on November 9,
2024. Plaintiff was given 15 days to file a Second Amended Complaint, yet as of
the date this ex parte application was filed, Plaintiff had not done so. 
Trial in this case is scheduled for May 21, 2024 and Defendants’ deadline to
file a Motion for Summary Judgment is January 30, 2024.  Without an
operative complaint, however, Defendants are unable to move for summary
judgment.  
 
“A motion to dismiss an entire action and for entry of
judgment after expiration of the time to amend following the sustaining of a
demurrer may be made by ex parte application to the Court under Code of Civil
Procedure section 581(f)(2).” (California Rules of Court, rule 3.1320.) “Except
where Section 597 applies, after a demurrer to the Complaint is sustained with
leave to amend, the Plaintiff fails to amend it within the time allowed by the
Court and either party moves for a dismissal.” (CCP § 518(f)(2).) 
 
In opposition, Counsel for Plaintiff submits a declaration
stating that in relying on their staff to properly calendar deadlines including
any Court imposed deadline to file an amended complaint, Plaintiff’s counsel
failed to ensure that the amended pleading was filed on time. (Lopez Decl., ¶
2.)  The Court is empowered to relieve a party “upon any terms as may be
just . . . from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against
him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect.” (CCP § 473(b).) Relief is mandatory when it is based on an “attorney
affidavit of fault,” and discretionary when based on declarations or other
evidence showing “mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) Errors made by an attorney’s staff are
attributed to and deemed the “fault” of the attorney for purposes of
entitlement to CCP 473(b) relief from mistake. (Hu v. Fang (2002) 104
Cal.App.4th 61, 64-65.)  Here, under the provisions of CCP § 473(b),
relief is mandatory.
 
This ex parte application was continued from January 22,
2024 to today’s date to allow Plaintiff time to file and serve his Second
Amended Complaint.  Plaintiff filed his Second Amended Complaint on
January 23, 2024.  The requirements of CCP § 473(b) have now been
satisfied.  
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ Ex Parte Application is DENIED. 
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
