And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has sustained Defendant Audi's demurrer to the Fifth Cause of Action for Negligent Repair with 20 days leave to amend. The judge finds that the Fifth Cause of Action fails to state a cause of action and is uncertain. The judge concludes that the economic loss rule bars the claim, as Plaintiff only seeks economic damages and does not allege any intentional misconduct or affirmative misrepresentations by Audi. However, the judge grants Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint, as there is a reasonable possibility of successfully stating a cause of action.
