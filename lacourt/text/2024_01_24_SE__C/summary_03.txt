And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling in this lemon law case, where the Defendants, Ford Motor Company and Norm Reeves Ford Superstore, have applied ex parte for an Order to Dismiss the entire action due to the Plaintiff, Maria Ramirez, failing to amend her First Amended Complaint after the Court sustained their Demurrer. The Plaintiff had 15 days to file a Second Amended Complaint, but as of the filing date, the Plaintiff had not done so. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff's counsel relied on staff to calendar deadlines, which resulted in the missed deadline. The Judge has granted the Plaintiff's request for relief under CCP § 473(b), which allows the Court to relieve a party from a judgment or dismissal due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The Judge has denied the ex parte application, allowing the Plaintiff to file and serve their Second Amended Complaint.
