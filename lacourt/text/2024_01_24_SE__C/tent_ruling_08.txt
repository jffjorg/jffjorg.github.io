Plaintiff Passport Foods USA, LLC applies ex parte to
advance the hearing date for its Motion to Compel Further Responses currently
set for October 9, 2024.  On November 21, 2023, the Court ordered
Defendants to provide Plaintiff with the tax documents sufficient to file form
941X for Q2, Q3, Q4 of 2020 and Q1, Q2 and Q3 of 2021 so Plaintiff may claim
the Employee Retention Credit (“ERTC”).  Defendants produced income tax
returns for 2020-2022, but no payroll tax documents.  Evidently, without
the payroll tax documents, Plaintiff cannot apply for the ETRC.  The
deadline to apply for the ETRC for 2020 and 2021 is April 15, 2024.  
 
Plaintiff’s ex parte application is GRANTED.
