 Case Number:  23NWCV00214    Hearing Date:   January 24, 2024    Dept:  C Gilda Oman
vs Victor Lucero, et al. Case No. 23NWCV00214
This is a rental
dispute. Plaintiff Gilda Oman leased the property located at 8700 Long
Beach Boulevard, 4 South Gate, California 90280 to the Defendants Victor Lucero
Dba Blue Diamond 5 Auto Sales and Ace Auto Group, Inc. A dispute arose over
non-payment of rent by the Defendants and an unlawful detainer action was
initiated in 2023. On the date of trial, the parties came to an agreement and
stipulated for the entry of judgment. Attached as Exhibit I to this Application
is a true and correct copy of the judgment that was entered along with the
Settlement Agreement. The Court reserved jurisdiction to enforce the Settlement
Agreement pursuant to statute. On or before January 1, 2024, the Defendants
alerted Plaintiff to their intention to breach the Settlement Agreement by not
vacating by January 1, 2024. Shortly after January 1, 2024, it was verified
that the Defendants remain in possession of the property and have no intention
of vacating at this time. The Defendant has lodged an appeal of his stipulated
judgment.
 
Plaintiff now seeks an order to enforce judgment. 
 
A party may seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual
showing "irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis
for granting relief ex parte." (Cal. R. Ct. 3.1202(c).)
 
Plaintiff states in reliance on the stipulated settlement
agreement and judgment that it has already secured a new tenant for the
property. Plaintiff was scheduled to turn over the property to the new tenant
who had entered into a substantial lease for the property. Plaintiff indicates
that it will be irreparably harmed if the ex parte is not granted. 
 
The Court is persuaded that Plaintiff will face irreparable
harm. 
 
Moreover, parties have agreed to the retention of
jurisdiction by the Court until the parties have performed under the full terms
of the settlement agreement.  (Ex Parte Application, Ex. 1; Ex. A ¶ 11.)
Accordingly, the Court may enforce this settlement. 
 
Plaintiff, in its’ proposed order request payment of
$20,000.00. However, the stipulation agreement allows for $33,000.00 if
Defendant does not vacate the premises on January 1, 2024. (Ex Parte
Application, Ex. 1; Ex. A ¶ 3.)
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the ex parte. Judgment awarded
in the amount of $33,000.00. Plaintiff is also entitled to possession and may
apply for a writ and purse a lockout immediately. 
 
Prevailing party to give notice.
