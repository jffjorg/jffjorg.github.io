Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Plaintiffs Hae Won Lee and Bora Violet Park
(collectively Plaintiffs) move to compel compliance with this Court’s Discovery
Order issued on June 23, 2023.
Background
On
January 6, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint against Defendant American Honda
Motors (Defendant) for alleged violations of the Song-Beverly Act for failure
to repair or repurchase Plaintiff’s vehicle.
Evidentiary
Objections 
Plaintiff’s
objections Nos. 1-14 are overruled.
Legal
Standard
“Except
as provided in subdivision (d), if a party then fails to obey an order
compelling inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the court may make those
orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).”
(CCP § 2031.320(c).)
Discussion

Plaintiffs move to compel compliance with the
Court’s General Lemon Law Discovery Order issued on June 23, 2023. Plaintiffs
argue that Defendant violated the Discovery Order because it failed to provide
verifications for the responses it provided pursuant to the Discovery Order.
The Discovery Order requires that all responses be verified. Thus, to the
extent that Defendant has not, Defendant is ordered to provide verifications
for all responses provided pursuant to the Discovery Order.
Plaintiffs argue that Defendant failed to
provide the last four digits of the VINs required by the Discovery Order. Thus,
Defendant is ordered to produce the complete VINs pursuant to the Discovery
Order subsection (h).
Plaintiffs argue that TSB 19-124 issued on
April 1, 2020 should be produced because it is relevant to establishing willful
failure to repurchase the vehicle for Plaintiff’s claim for civil penalties.
Plaintiffs allege they first noticed shaking and hard shifting on May 16, 2020.
(Beck Decl., Ex. 1.) Further, the October 9, 2021 TSB 19-124 refers to an
update to the part from an earlier TSB. Thus, the April 1, 2020 TSB 19-124 is
discoverable because it is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.
Finally, Plaintiffs argue that Defendant failed
to produce a list or compilation of the customer complaints in spreadsheet or
list format and Bates Nos. 1776-2171 as stated in its Opposition. To the extent
that Defendant failed to produce documents it claims are responsive to similar
customer complaints of 2018 Honda Odysseys, it is ordered to do so, in
particular the documents it identifies as Bates Nos. 1776-2171 that it states
are responsive. Additionally, Defendant is to provide a spreadsheet or chart format
of the customer complaints as required by Discovery Order subsection (h).
Sanctions
The court shall impose a monetary sanction
against the party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel
further responses to interrogatories or demand for production of documents
unless the party subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (CCP §§ 2030.300(d), 2031.310(h),
2033.290(d).) 
Plaintiffs seek sanctions for each day after an
initial 10-day compliance period that Defendant fails to comply with the
Court’s order. Defendant seeks sanctions against Plaintiffs for misuse of the
discovery process for making an unsuccessful motion to compel without
substantial justification. The Court declines to award sanctions because many
of the issues raised by Plaintiffs were resolved by meeting and conferring, however,
Plaintiffs’ Motion was still necessary for limited orders.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiffs’
Motion to Compel Compliance is GRANTED in part as to the remaining issues
discussed above. Defendant is to serve verified reponses within 20 days of this
Order. Plaintiffs and Defendant’s requests for sanctions are DENIED.
