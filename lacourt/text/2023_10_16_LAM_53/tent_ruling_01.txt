[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to compel further
  response to form interrogatory number 12.1
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Jose Hernandez         
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant General Motors, LLC
Motion to Compel Further Response to Form
Interrogatory Number 12.1
The court considered the amended moving, opposition, and reply papers
filed in connection with this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Jose Hernandez (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order compelling
defendant General Motors, LLC (“Defendant”) to provide a further response to
Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatory number 12.1.
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s
further response to Form Interrogatory number 12.1 because (1) Defendant’s
answer to that interrogatory is evasive and incomplete, and (2) Defendant’s
exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
unwarranted.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.300, subds. (a)(1), (a)(2).) 
 
ORDER
The court grants plaintiff
Jose Hernandez’s motion to compel further response to Form Interrogatory number
12.1. 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
2030.300, the court orders defendant General Motors, LLC to serve a further, full and
complete answer to plaintiff
Jose Hernandez’s Form
Interrogatories, number 12.1, which complies with Code of Civil
Procedure sections 2030.210-2030.200, and 2030.250, within 20 days of the date
of this order. 
The court orders plaintiff
Jose Hernandez to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  October 16, 2023
