The arbitration provision at issue states that it shall be governed by the
Federal Arbitration Act.  (Richardson
Decl., Ex. 1, RISC, p. 5, Arbitration Provision [“Any arbitration under this
Arbitration Provision shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9
U.S.C. § 1 et seq.) and not by any state law concerning arbitration”].)

The court notes that this language is partially illegible.  (Richardson Decl., Ex. 1, RISC, p. 1.)  However, Defendants have quoted the language
of this section in their moving papers and Plaintiff does not dispute the
accuracy of their quotation.  (Mot., p.
1:24-28.)

The court notes that, in reply, Nissan states that its motion does not seek to
compel arbitration on this ground. 
(Reply, p. 1, fn. 3.)  It is
unclear if this is a typographical error or if Nissan has abandoned this
theory.  The court therefore discusses
the merits of this contention.
