And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The defendants, Nissan North America, Inc. and Wish Automotive III, Inc., d/b/a Nissan of Alhambra, sought to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings based on an arbitration provision in a Retail Installment Sale Contract (RISC) entered into by the parties. However, the court found that the defendants did not meet their burden to show that they could enforce the arbitration provision against the plaintiff, Joaquin Alejandro Velazquez, based on the doctrine of equitable estoppel or third-party beneficiary theory.

The court also found that the arbitration provision was not unconscionable. The court therefore denied the motion and ordered the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
