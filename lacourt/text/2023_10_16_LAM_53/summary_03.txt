And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a dispute over an arbitration provision. The provision states that it shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, but the court notes that the language is partially illegible. Despite this, the defendants have quoted the language in their moving papers, and the plaintiff does not dispute the accuracy of the quotation. The court is uncertain whether Nissan, the defendant, is seeking to compel arbitration on this ground, as their motion does not explicitly state so. The court will discuss the merits of this contention in further detail.
