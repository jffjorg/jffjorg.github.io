And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the petition for a writ of mandate filed by Lily Yang, who seeks to set aside the administrative decision of the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to suspend her driving privileges. The DMV suspended her license for one year after she was arrested and released with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.039%. The DMV found that Deputy Valenti had reasonable cause to believe Yang was driving under the influence and that she was lawfully arrested. Yang argues that the DMV did not properly administer the Preliminary Alcohol Screening (PAS) test. The court finds that the DMV properly administered the test and that the PAS test results were admissible. The court also finds that Yang failed to rebut the presumption that the DMV complied with Title 17 regulations. Therefore, the petition for a writ of mandate is denied.
