And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies Petitioner Angela Taylor's Petition for Order Permitting a Late Claim Against a Governmental Entity. The Petitioner tripped and fell at the Taste of Soul Festival and seeks to present a late claim against the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The Petitioner's counsel did not demonstrate reasonable diligence in discovering the available claims against respondent, and the Petitioner's application fails to provide any explanation for the delay in serving a demand on the insurance carrier. The Petitioner's claim was not timely submitted, and the Petitioner's counsel did not serve a demand on the insurance carrier until after the deadline had passed. Therefore, the Petition is DENIED.
