Case:               Angela Taylor v. LA County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (23STCP04102)
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Petitioner Angela Taylor’s Petition for Order Permitting a
Late Claim Against a Governmental Entity is DENIED. 
 
Respondent Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority’s requests for judicial notice are GRANTED. (Evid. Code § 452(h).) 
 
On October 15, 2022, near Crenshaw Boulevard and W. Martin
Luther King Jr. Boulevard, petitioner Angela Taylor alleges she tripped on
exposed wires and fell at the Taste of Soul Festival, causing her to sustain
injuries. (Green Decl. Ex. 1 [Claim for Damages].) According to petitioner’s
counsel, she learned that the property where petitioner tripped may be owned
and maintained by respondent Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority. (Green Decl. ¶¶ 6-7.) 
 
To bring a suit for damages against a public entity such as respondent,
petitioner was first required by Government Code §
945.4 to make a written claim with the public entity.  A claim relating to a cause of action for
personal injury must be presented to the public entity no later than six months
after the accrual of the cause of action.¿ (Gov. Code § 911.2; Munoz v.
State of California¿(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1767, 1776.)¿Accordingly, petitioner had at most until April 17, 2023 (six months
after the October 15, 2022 claimed date of injury) to present her claim to
respondent. (See Jiminez v. Chavez
(2023) 97 Cal.App.5th 50, 58 [six-month limitations period is the longer of six
calendar months or 182 days].)
 
On August 30, 2023, petitioner submitted a written
application to respondent for leave to present a late claim. (CCP §§ 911.4,
911.6; Green Decl. Ex. 2.) Petitioner asserts that respondent has not responded
to the application. (Petition at 2:24-27.) Respondent does not dispute the
assertion. (See Sheppard Decl. ¶ 2.) Accordingly, the application is
deemed to have been denied on Monday, October 16, 2023. (Gov. Code § 911.6(c)
[“If the board fails or refuses to act on an application within the time
prescribed by this section, the application shall be deemed to have been denied
on the 45th day….”]; CCP § 12a(a) [deadline falling on Saturday moved to next
day that is not a holiday, i.e., Monday].)
 
Petitioner files
the instant petition seeking relief under Government Code § 946.6 to present a
late claim. The instant petition was filed on November 7, 2023,
within six months of October 16, 2023, which renders it
timely in accordance with Government Code § 946.6(b).
 
To obtain relief here, petitioner must demonstrate that the
failure to present a claim under Government Code § 945.4 was “through mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect….” (Gov. Code § 946.6(c)(1).) “The
mere recital of mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect is not
sufficient to warrant relief…. There must be more than the mere failure to
discover a fact; the party seeking relief must establish the failure to
discover the fact in the exercise of reasonable diligence.” (Department of
Water & Power v. Superior Court (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1288, 1293.) “The
party seeking relief based on a claim of mistake must establish he was diligent
in investigating and pursuing the claim [citation] and must establish the
necessary elements justifying relief by the preponderance of the evidence.” (Ibid.)
 
Petitioner appears to have been diligent in hiring counsel.  Petitioner hired counsel two days after the
subject incident. (Green Decl. ¶ 2.) 
 
Petitioner’s counsel, however, does not demonstrate
reasonable diligence in discovering the available claims against respondent.
“[A] late claimant who seeks relief under section 946.6 may be barred by
inexcusable delay by counsel.” (Hasty v. County of Los Angeles (1976) 61
Cal.App.3d 623, 626, citing Black v. County of Los Angeles (1970) 12
Cal.App.3d 670, 674-77.) Here, counsel was notified of Taste of Soul’s
insurance carrier on November 8, 2022, approximately five months before the
April 17, 2023 deadline to file a government claim. (Green Decl. ¶ 4.) Petitioner’s
counsel inexplicably did not serve a demand on the insurance carrier until
August 15, 2023, after the deadline had passed. (Green Decl. ¶ 5.) Petitioner’s
application fails to provide any explanation for why counsel delayed until
after April 17, 2023 to serve the demand. 
This was not reasonable diligence. 

 
Indeed, the lack of reasonable diligence is highlighted by
the fact that the insurance carrier responded by letter within days (August 24,
2023) and provided the information that the property in question was owned and
maintained by respondent, a governmental entity.  If counsel had served the demand shortly
after notification of the identity of Taste of Souls’ insurance carrier, instead
of delaying for nine months, it would appear petitioner could have received a
response earlier and timely served the government claim. 
 
For the foregoing reasons, petitioner does not demonstrate
the diligence necessary to obtain relief under Government Code § 946.6. While
there is a “general policy favoring trial on the merits,” it “cannot be applied
indiscriminately so as to render ineffective the statutory time limits.” (Department
of Water, 82 Cal.App.4th at 1293.)
 
The petition is DENIED.
