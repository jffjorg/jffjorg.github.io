[1]           “Under the administrative per se law,
the DMV must immediately suspend the driver's license of a person who is
driving with .08 percent or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood.
[Citation.] The procedure is called ‘administrative per se’ because it does not
impose criminal penalties, but simply suspends a person's driver's license as
an administrative matter upon a showing the person was arrested for driving
with a certain blood-alcohol concentration, without additional evidence of
impairment.” (MacDonald v. Gutierrez (2004) 32 Cal.4th 150, 155.) 


[2]           Petitioner does not otherwise
challenge the findings upon which the decision is based, i.e.,
reasonable cause that petitioner drove under the influence of alcohol and lawful
arrest. (See AR 5; Veh. Code § 13353(d) [listing factors necessary to trigger
penalty of suspension].)
 


[3]           CDLA II follows the Court of
Appeal’s prior appellate opinion in California DUI Lawyers Assn. v.
