[TENTATIVE] RULING ON VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT
  OF MANDATE
 
Dept. 82 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)
 
 




 


 


 


 



Petitioner
Lily Yang petitions for a writ of mandate directing respondent Steven Gordon,
Director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles (“Department” or “DMV”)
to set aside an order suspending petitioner’s driving privileges. 
 
I.       Factual Background
 
A.          
Arrest
and Release of Petitioner
 
On
October 1, 2022, at 2:56 a.m., Deputy Valenti of the Santa Barbara County
Sheriff’s Office was on routine patrol in a marked patrol vehicle in Isla Vista
with passenger Deputy Harrington. (AR 15.) Deputy Valenti observed petitioner
Lily Yang’s vehicle crossing over and/or straddling the double yellow lines.
(AR 16; see Veh. Code § 21460(a) [driver shall not drive to left of
double parallel solid yellow lines].) Deputy Valenti also observed petitioner’s
vehicle failing to stop at the limit line at a stop sign. (AR 16; see Veh.
Code § 22450(a) [driver approaching stop sign shall stop at limit line].) 
 
Deputy
Valenti stopped and approached petitioner’s vehicle. (AR 16.) Petitioner rolled
down her left front window. (AR 16.) Deputy Valenti asked for petitioner’s
license, registration, and proof of insurance, all of which petitioner provided.
(AR 16.) Deputy Valenti detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from
inside the vehicle and noticed petitioner’s eyes were slightly bloodshot. (AR
16.) After observing several objective signs of intoxication, Deputy Valenti
directed petitioner to exit the car and walk to the east sidewalk for field
sobriety tests (“FSTs”). (AR 16.) When petitioner exited the vehicle and walked
ahead of Deputy Valenti, she seemed off-balance. (AR 16.) 
 
Deputy
Valenti asked petitioner the pre-FST questions. (AR 16.) Deputy Valenti smelled
the odor of alcohol on petitioner’s breath, but petitioner denied having
consumed alcohol. (AR 16.) Deputy Valenti then asked petitioner to perform
several FSTs. (AR 16.) Petitioner did not perform the tests as explained and
demonstrated. (AR 16.) Deputy Valenti asked petitioner to complete a preliminary
alcohol screening (“PAS”) test. (AR 16.) The PAS test result was .039% blood-alcohol
concentration (“BAC”). (AR 16-17.) Petitioner was 20 years of age at the time
of the stop. (AR 15.) During the FSTs, Deputy Valenti asked petitioner about
the stop sign violation; petitioner said she did not notice the stop sign. (AR
16.) 
 
Deputy
Valenti completed a citation for violations of Vehicle Code sections 22450 and
23126. (AR 10, 16; see Vehicle Code § 23136 [unlawful for person under
21 years of age who has a BAC of 0.01% or greater to drive a vehicle].) Deputy
Valenti issued a DS-367 notice of suspension. (AR 8, 16.) Petitioner ordered an
Uber and was released. (AR 16.) Petitioner’s vehicle was towed. (AR 16.)
 
B.          
DS-367
Under Age 21 Officer’s Statement
 
In
the sworn DS-367 form, Deputy Valenti certified under penalty of perjury under
the laws of the State of California: (1) that he obtained the PAS test results
in the regular course of his duties; (2) that he used the PAS Model, Alcotest
7510, serial number ARBJ-0294, manufactured by Drager; (3) that he administered
the PAS test properly in accordance with the manufacturer’s guidelines and
instructions; (4) that he has received training on the proper operation of the
device and administration of the PAS test and is competent and qualified to
operate the device; and (5) that the device was functioning properly at the
time of the test. (AR 8.) 
            
C.          
Administrative
Hearing
 
The
administrative hearing took place on January 10, 2023. (AR 20.) Hearing Officer
Bates introduced four exhibits into evidence: (1) Under Age 21 Officer’s Statement
(DS-367); (2) Report of Offense with the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office;
(3) PAS breath test; and (4) petitioner’s driving record print-out. (AR 22-24.)
Petitioner objected to all four exhibits as hearsay or lacking foundation. (AR
24.) All exhibits were admitted into evidence over petitioner’s objections. (AR
24-25.) 
 
Petitioner’s
counsel argued that the PAS test should not be considered because the officer
failed to comply with Title 17 regulations. (AR 25-27.) No witnesses were
called, and petitioner presented no evidence. (AR 20-27.) 
 
A
decision was issued by the Department on January 13, 2023. (AR 5.) Based on a
preponderance of the evidence, the Department concluded: (1) that the peace
officer had reasonable cause to believe that petitioner had been driving in
violation of Vehicle Code section 23136; (2) that petitioner was lawfully
arrested or detained; and (3) that petitioner was driving a motor vehicle while
under 21 with a BAC of 0.01% or greater measured by a PAS or other chemical
test. (AR 5.) The hearing officer considered petitioner’s arguments but deemed
them to be without merit because petitioner did not offer any evidence in
support of her arguments or to rebut the Department’s case. (AR 4.) 
 
The
Department imposed a one-year license suspension, effective January 22, 2023,
through January 21, 2024. (AR 6.) 
 
II.      Procedural History
 
            On
April 14, 2023, petitioner Lily Yang filed a Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate.
On October 2, 2023, respondent Steven Gordon, Director of the California
Department of Motor Vehicles filed an Answer. 
 
            On
August 8, 2023, the Court denied petitioner’s ex parte application for a stay
of license suspension on the ground that a stay would be against the public
interest.
 
            A
memorandum of points and authorities was attached to the petition filed on
April 14, 2023. On March 20, 2024, respondent filed an opposition. Petitioner
did not file a reply. The Court has received the administrative record lodged
by petitioner. 
 
III.     Standard of Review
 
Under CCP section 1094.5(b), the pertinent issues
are whether the respondent has proceeded without jurisdiction, whether there
was a fair trial, and whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion. An
abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in the
manner required by law, the decision is not supported by the findings, or the
findings are not supported by the evidence. (CCP § 1094.5(b).) “[T]he
party challenging the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing
the court that the administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the
evidence.” (Fukuda v. City of Angels (1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 817; see
also Bixby v. Pierno (1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 139.)
 
When a driver petitions for a writ of mandate
following an order suspending her driver’s license, the trial court is required
to determine, based on its independent judgment, whether the weight of the
evidence supports the administrative decision. (Lake v. Reed (1997) 16
Cal.4th 448, 456.) Under the
independent judgment test, “the trial court not only examines the
administrative record for errors of law, but also exercises its independent
judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a limited trial de novo.” (Bixby, 4 Cal.3d at 143.) The court must draw its own reasonable
inferences from the evidence and make its own credibility determinations. (Morrison v. Housing Authority of the City of
Los Angeles Board of Commissioners (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 860, 868.)  However, “[i]n exercising its independent judgment, a trial court must afford a
strong presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings, and
the party challenging the administrative decision bears the burden of
convincing the court that the administrative findings are contrary to the
weight of the evidence.” (Fukuda, 20
Cal.4th at 817, internal quotations omitted.)
 
“Evidence Code section 664, which presumes that an
official duty has been regularly performed, has been widely applied to DMV
administrative hearings.” (Petricka v. Department of Motor Vehicles
(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 1341, 1348.) “[I]n an administrative hearing, ‘[a]ny
relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which
responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious
affairs....’ [Citations.] ‘A police officers report, even if unsworn, constitutes
‘the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in
the conduct of serious affairs….’” (MacDonald v. Gutierrez (2004) 32
Cal.4th 150, 158-159.)
 
IV.     Analysis
 
A.          
Overview
of Zero Tolerance Law
 
            Under the zero tolerance law set
forth in Vehicle Code section § 23136(a),[1]
driving a vehicle with a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.01% or greater while
under 21 years of age is unlawful. (Coniglio v. Department of Motor Vehicles
(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 666, 673.) The BAC is measured by a preliminary alcohol
screening test or other chemical test. (§ 23136(a).) 
 
            “Once
a licensee is cited for violating the zero tolerance law, the DMV must then
review the officer's sworn report and make a determination of the facts
requiring suspension. This ruling is final unless the licensee timely requests
a hearing pursuant to section 13558.” (Coniglio, 39 Cal.App.4th at 673,
citing § 13557.) “Upon the licensee's timely request, the DMV must hold an administrative
hearing at which the evidence is not limited to that presented at the prior
administrative review.” (Coniglio, 39 Cal.App.4th at 673-74, citing §
13558(b).) 
 
            At
the hearing, the Department determines whether (1) the peace officer had
reasonable cause to believe that the person was driving in violation of section
23136, (2) the driver was lawfully arrested or detained, and (3) the driver was
under 21 years of age with a BAC of 0.01% or greater as measured by a PAS or
other chemical test. (§ 13557(b)(3).) 


 
B.   Presumption Concerning
Reliability of PAS
 
            Petitioner
seeks to set aside the administrative decision of the Department to suspend her
driving privileges. Relying on Coniglio, petitioner contends that the results
of the PAS were inadmissible during the administrative hearing, because the
Department did not establish the accuracy and reliability of the PAS device. 
 
            While
a PAS device may be used to determine the presence of alcohol in the blood, it
must be proven that the particular PAS device used was reliable. (Coniglio,
39 Cal.App.4th at 681.) “An officer’s sworn statement that, when tested, a
licensee's PAS test showed the presence of alcohol in the licensee's blood is
legally sufficient evidence ‘if and only if there is a basis for believing that
the test which [detected] blood alcohol was reliable.’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.)
To admit PAS test results as evidence of a zero tolerance law violation, the
Department has the burden to show that “‘(1) the particular apparatus utilized
was in proper working order, (2) the test used was properly administered, and
(3) the operator was competent and qualified.’” (Id.  at 681-82, quoting People v. Adams
(1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 559, 561.)
 
By
presenting the DS-367 Under Age 21 Officer’s Statement form signed by Deputy
Valenti (AR 8, 22), the Department met its burden to demonstrate the
reliability of the PAS test administered to petitioner. Deputy Valenti
certified under penalty of perjury that he obtained the PAS test results from
petitioner in the regular course of his duties and that the PAS test revealed that
petitioner had a BAC of 0.039% (AR 8.) With respect to the three requirements
to admit PAS test results, as set forth above, Deputy Valenti also certified
under penalty of perjury: (1) that the PAS device he used to obtain
petitioner’s BAC was functioning properly at the time of the test; (2) that he
properly administered the PAS test in accordance with the manufacturer's
guidelines and instructions; and (3) that he received training in how to use
the PAS device and he was competent and qualified to operate the device. (AR 8.)

 
Under
Evidence Code § 664, “[i]t is presumed that official duty has been regularly
performed.” Because Deputy Valenti’s averments were based on his direct
observations and personal knowledge, the DS-367 form is presumed trustworthy
based on his statutory duty to report the facts of a blood alcohol test. (Davenport
v. Department of Motor Vehicles (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 133, 143.) Further, under
Evidence Code § 664, law enforcement agencies and their officers are presumed
to have complied with statutory and regulatory standards, thus leading to an
inference that the PAS test was reliable. (Id. at 144.) The standards
include Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations, which sets forth
regulations for forensic alcohol analysis and standards for the competency of
blood alcohol test results. (Id. at 142.) 
 
            In Coniglio, however, the
Court of Appeal found that Title 17 regulations do not apply to PAS tests,
thereby leaving the testing and reliability of PAS tests ungoverned by any
statutes or regulations. (Coniglio, 39 Cal.App.4th at 683.) Consequently,
the Coniglio court found the “official duty” presumption under Evidence
Code § 664 to be inapplicable. Petitioner appears to rely on this holding in asserting
that the DS-367 form is insufficient to demonstrate the three requirements to
admit a PAS test are satisfied.[2]

 
            However, after Coniglio was decided,
the California Supreme Court found that PAS breath test results are admissible “upon
a showing of either compliance with title 17 or the foundational
elements of (1) properly functioning equipment, (2) a properly administered
test, and (3) a qualified operator….” (People v. Williams (2002) 28
Cal.4th 408, 417, footnote admitted, emphasis added.) The high court thus rejected
the holding in Coniglio that Title 17 never applies to PAS tests. (Id.
at 414, fn. 2.) Instead, the high court confirmed that “title 17
regulations apply to PAS tests that determine the concentration of alcohol in the
blood but not those that determine only its presence.” (Ibid.) 
 
            In this case, the PAS test
administered to petitioner indicated the concentration of blood alcohol. (AR 8
[.039%].) Accordingly, Title 17 applies to the PAS test at issue here, and the DMV
may rely on the Evidence Code § 664 “official duty” presumption that the Santa
Barbara Sheriff’s Office and Deputy Valenti complied with Title 17, thereby giving
rise to the inference that the PAS test administered to petitioner was
admissible. (Molenda v. Department of Motor Vehicles (2009) 172
Cal.App.4th 974, 1002; Davenport, 6 Cal.App.4th at 144.)  “[T]he [§ 664] presumption attaches once
the DMV presents competent evidence (through presentation of the documents
contemplated in the statutory scheme) in support of its prima facie case.” (Morgenstern
v. Department of Motor Vehicles (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 366, 373.) For the
reasons stated above, admission of the DS-367 form into evidence triggered the
“official duty” presumption. 
 
The
burden shifted to petitioner to “produce competent affirmative evidence that
the applicable standards were not observed in order to rebut the presumption”
that Deputy Valenti properly administered the PAS test using properly operating
equipment. (Ibid.) Despite having had the opportunity to subpoena Deputy
Valenti or documents relevant to the reliability of the PAS test results (Davenport,
6 Cal.App.4th at 144-45), petitioner presented no evidence during the
administrative hearing to rebut the presumption that the PAS test results were
reliable and properly obtained. Accordingly, petitioner fails to establish that
the PAS test was inadmissible. 
 
            For the foregoing reasons, petitioner
is not entitled to the revocation of the suspension of her driving privileges
or any award of attorney fees under Government Code § 800.
 
V.      Conclusion
 
The petition for writ of mandate is DENIED.
Pursuant to Local Rule 3.231(n), respondent Steven Gordon, Director of the
California Department of Motor Vehicles shall prepare, serve, and ultimately
file a proposed judgment.
 
Respondent as a public agency shall recover costs
pursuant to Government Code § 6103.5.
