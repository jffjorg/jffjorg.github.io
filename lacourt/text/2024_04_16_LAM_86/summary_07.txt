And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's application for a writ of possession. The plaintiff, Arturo Fausto, claims to be the owner of a 1972 Chevy Z-10, which was stored in the defendant's home without his consent. The defendant, Rigoberto Tejada Jimenez, claims that the plaintiff's brother, Angel Fausto, is the actual owner of the vehicle. The court finds that the plaintiff has not demonstrated that it is more likely than not that he will obtain a judgment against the defendant. Therefore, the application for a writ of possession is denied.
