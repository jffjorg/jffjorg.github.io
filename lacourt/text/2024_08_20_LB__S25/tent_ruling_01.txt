  Case Number:  23LBCV01418    Hearing Date:   August 20, 2024    Dept:  S25 Procedural BackgroundOn July 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants Rodney Andrews and Does 1 to 10, alleging a breach of contract cause of action and open book account cause of action. Plaintiff is a debt buyer that purchased debt after charge-off from charge-off creditor IBI Consumer Credit, L.P. (Compl., ¶¶ 2-4.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant executed and delivered a credit application to the original creditor, Cross River Bank and that pursuant to the credit application, Cross River Bank provided Defendant with a credit account (“Account”). (Compl., ¶ 9.) Also, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to make payments as agreed on the Account, with the date of last payment on the subject account on December 30, 2022. (Compl., ¶¶ 13, 14.) Plaintiff further alleges that after charge-off and applying any and all applicable payments and credits, the Defendant owes Plaintiff $27,001.39. (Compl., ¶ 16.)On August 29, 2023, Defendant filed a general denial. On January 31, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion to dismiss.DiscussionPlaintiff brings a collections lawsuit against Defendant. Defendant’s motion cites Fuhrman v. California Satellite Systems (1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 408 but he fails to explain how that case applies to the present matter. Fuhrman is inapposite because Fuhrman involved a civil extortion claim, among other claims, meanwhile, in this matter, there is no civil extortion claim asserted.Next, Defendant sets forth cases that provide legal standards for a demurrer but makes no arguments as to why the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute its two causes of action. Moreover, Defendant has not provided any indication of properly meeting and conferring with Plaintiff pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a) [“Before filing a demurrer . . . the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer”].)Defendant sets forth conclusory statements that the two causes of action are barred by the doctrine of waiver, doctrine of estoppels, and doctrine of laches without providing any factual proof and legal argument in support. Defendant asserts that the complaint on file is not verified and thus entitles Defendant to file a general denial. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 431.30, subd. (d).)Filing a general denial does not warrant mandatory dismissal of this action. (See Walsh v. West Valley Mission Community College Dist. (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1532, 1545 [“The filing of a general denial denies in one sentence all the allegations of the complaint . . . In the case of a complaint for breach of contract, a general denial denies that there is a contract, that the plaintiff performed or had an excuse for nonperformance, that the defendant did not perform, or that the plaintiff was damaged. A general denial allows the denying party the opportunity to present evidence to refute the allegations in the complaint”]; see also Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2024) ¶ 6:404.1 [“A general denial may ‘sandbag’ plaintiff at trial because it places at issue every material allegation in the complaint. Plaintiff must be prepared to prove everything on which its right to recover depends, even pure formalities; e.g., plaintiff's license status, corporate status, etc.”])Tentative RulingDefendant’s Motion to Dismiss is DENIED.Case Management Conference/Trial Readiness Conference set for 9/19/24 at 8:30 a.m.Final Status Conference set for 11/13/24 at 8:30 in personTrial set for 11/5/24 at 9:30 a.m. in personCourt to give notice
