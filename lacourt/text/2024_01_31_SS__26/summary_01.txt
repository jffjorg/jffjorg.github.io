And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment filed by Defendant Pilar Devries. The Motion is denied. The judge finds that the Motion does not satisfy the requirements for relief under Code of Civil Procedure sections 473(b), 473(d), and 473.5. Specifically, the Motion was not timely filed, and the defendant has not shown that the judgment was entered due to extrinsic fraud or excusable mistake. The judge also finds that the Motion makes incomplete or incorrect arguments concerning each ground for relief and fails to cite any evidence in support of these arguments. As a result, the Motion is denied, and the default judgment stands.
