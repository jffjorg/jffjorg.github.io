Default Judgment; and Request for Sanctions is DENIED.
 
                                                                                                                                
ANALYSIS:
 
On November 10, 2020, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for automobile
subrogation against Defendant Pilar Devries (“Defendant”). The Court granted
Plaintiff’s application for service by publication on March 1, 2022 and proof
of service by publication was filed on May 20, 2022. Following Defendant’s
failure to file a responsive pleading, the Court entered default on October 12,
2022 and default judgment on December 12, 2023. Notice of entry of judgment was
filed on February 10, 2023. 
 
Defendant filed the instant Motion to Vacate Default and
Default Judgment on December 28, 2023. Plaintiff filed an opposition on January
18, 2024 and Defendant replied on January 24, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant moves to vacate the entry of default pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivisions (b) and (d), section 473.5, or
on equitable grounds. Defendant also moves for monetary sanctions pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5. 
 
First, Defendant moves to vacate the default on
grounds that it is void, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (d), which states that “[t]he court may, .... on motion of
either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or
order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (d).) Defendant’s own Motion explains
that a judgment is void under this statute where the defendant was either not
served or improperly served. (Motion, p. 13:2-3.) The Motion, however, does not
explain how Defendant was not served or improperly served. Instead, it argues
that the default judgment is void because it is based on fraud or
misrepresentations. (Id. at pp. 12:11-12, 13:5-6.) Arguing the judgment
is improper on the merits does not track with the legal definition of a void
judgment, as set forth in Defendant’s own Motion. Therefore, Defendant has not
shown they are entitled to relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (d).
 
Next, the Motion is
brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), which
states that an application for relief must be made no more than six months
after entry of the order from which relief is sought and must be accompanied by
an affidavit of fault attesting to the mistake, inadvertence, surprise or
neglect of the moving party or its attorney. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd.
(b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.)
The motion must also be accompanied by a copy of the moving defendant’s
proposed pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) This can be corrected
if Defendant submits a proposed responsive pleading by the hearing date. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi (2009) 175
Cal.App.4th 393, 403.) 
 
The instant Motion was not timely filed within six months of
entry of default on December 12, 2022. The six-month deadline is jurisdictional
and not subject to tolling. (Manson, Iver & York v. Black (2009) 176
Cal.App.4th 36, 42.) Therefore, Defendant cannot obtain relief under Code of
Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). 
 
 
Third, the Motion is brought under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473.5, subdivision (a): 
 
When service of a summons has not resulted
in actual notice to a party in time to defend the action and a default or
default judgment has been entered against him or
her in the action, he or she may serve and file a
notice of motion to set aside the default or default judgment and for
leave to defend the action.  The notice of
motion shall be served and filed within a reasonable time, but in no event
exceeding the earlier of: (i) two years after entry of a default judgment
against him or her; or (ii) 180 days after service on him or
her of a written notice that the default or default judgment has
been entered.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (a).)
Additionally, the motion “shall be accompanied by an affidavit showing under
oath that the party's lack of actual notice in time to defend the action was
not caused by his or her avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect. The party
shall serve and file with the notice a copy of the answer, motion, or other
pleading proposed to be filed in the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd.
(b).) Defendant’s Motion only provides argument regarding the first factor:
lack of acutal notice of the action due to service of the Summons and Complaint
by publication. (Motion, pp. 4:25-27, 14:22-25.) However, the Motion does not
point the Court to evidence of the lack of actual notice. (Ibid.)
Similarly, the Motion does not provide argument nor evidence regarding the
other statutory factors of timeliness, avoidance of service, or inexcusable
neglect. (Ibid.) 
 
Finally, the Motion cites equitable grounds to vacate the
default and default judgment, which must demonstrate that the judgment was
entered due to extrinsic fraud or excusable mistake. (Citing Slusher v.
Durrer (1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 747, 754.) The Motion, however, does not
indicate which of these two grounds applies, provides no explanation of what
constitutes extrinsic fraud or excusable mistake, nor refers to the other
factors for equitable relief, including diligence and a meritorious defense. It
simply argues that the default was “improperly entered.” (Motion, p. 16:10-11.)
This is not sufficient to demonstrate to the Court that equitable relief is
warranted.
 
Ultimately, the Motion makes incomplete or
incorrect arguments concerning each ground for relief. It also fails to cite
any evidence in the memorandum of points and authorities in support of these
arguments. Simply attaching declarations in support of the Motion without
reference to the corresponding evidence therein—perhaps assuming the Court will
dig through them and connect the dots—is not sufficient to obtain relief. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Pilar Devries’ Motion to Vacate Default and
Default Judgment; and Request for Sanctions is DENIED. 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
