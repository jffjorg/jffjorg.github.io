 Case Number:  24STCV05171    Hearing Date:   September 9, 2024    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Default
Judgment
Plaintiff 6611-6637 Hollywood (LA) OZ Owner, LLC filed a complaint
against defendant M.D.F. International, Inc. 
On May 9, 2024, the clerk entered the default of defendant M.D.F.
International, Inc.  Despite that
default, defendant served and filed an answer on June 4, 2024.  The clerk should have rejected the answer.  Because defendant filed (and the clerk
accepted) an answer less than a month after defendant’s default was entered, defendant
has a substantial probability of obtaining relief from its default.      
Plaintiff is ordered to meet
and confer with defendant regarding stipulating to relief from default within
15 days.  The order to show cause re:
default judgment is hereby continued to December 2, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
