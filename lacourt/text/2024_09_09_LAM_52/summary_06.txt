And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Felix Ajegbo's motion to vacate an arbitration award and for a restraining order against Daniel Louis Losito. The Judge has denied the motion with prejudice, finding that it is frivolous and untimely. The arbitration award was made in 2010, and the petition to vacate it was not filed until nearly five years later, after the court had already entered a judgment of dismissal on December 2, 2019. Additionally, the restraining order is based on an email sent in 2007, which is also untimely. The Judge has concluded that the motion is without merit and is denying it with prejudice.
