 Case Number:  BS173503    Hearing Date:   September 9, 2024    Dept:  52 Petitioner
Felix Ajegbo’s Motion to Vacate Arbitration Award and for Restraining Order
Petitioner Felix Ajegbo moves to vacate an
arbitration award against him and moves for a restraining order against
respondent Daniel Louis Losito. 
Ajegbo’s motion is frivolous.  This proceeding ended nearly five years
ago.  The court entered judgment of
dismissal on December 2, 2019.  Ajegbo
seeks to vacate an arbitration award made in 2010.  A petition to vacate an arbitration award
“shall be served and filed not later than 100 days after the date of the
service of a signed copy of the award on the petitioner.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288.)  Ajegbo seeks a restraining order based on an
email sent on September 7, 2007. 
(Motion, p. 23.)  Ajegbo’s motion
is untimely.  Even if the motion were
timely, Ajegbo fails to show any basis for the relief he seeks.
Petitioner Felix Ajegbo’s motion is denied
with prejudice.
