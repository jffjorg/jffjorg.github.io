And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant, Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith LLP, has demurred to all three causes of action alleged by the plaintiff, Jonathan J. Larsen, in his first amended complaint. The Judge has overruled the demurrer and ordered the defendant to answer within 20 days.

The three causes of action are:

1. Breach of Contract: The Judge has ruled that the plaintiff has adequately alleged a breach of contract by the defendant's unilateral termination of the Exclusive Representation Agreement (ERA).
2. Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing: The Judge has ruled that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts to support this claim, including allegations that the defendant acted in bad faith to engineer a way to terminate the contract.
3. Quantum Meruit: The Judge has ruled that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to support a claim for quantum meruit, which is a legal doctrine that allows a plaintiff to recover the reasonable value of services rendered to a defendant.

The Judge has relied on various legal precedents and statutes in making these rulings, including Code of Civil Procedure ยง 430.10, subdivision (g), Careau & Co. v. Security Pacific Business Credit, Inc., Bionghi v. Metropolitan Water Dist. of So. California, Hedging Concepts, Inc. v. First Alliance Mortgage Co., and Ochs v. PacifiCare of California.
