 Case Number:  23STCV25320    Hearing Date:   September 9, 2024    Dept:  52 Thomas & Elliott
LLP’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel 
Thomas & Elliott LLP
moves to be relieved as counsel for defendants/cross-complainants Chateau Nob
Hill Apartments, LP and Global Integrity Realty Corporation.  
Three days after counsel
filed this motion, cross-defendants filed a special motion to strike the first
amended cross-complaint.  California
Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 1.16(d) provides, “A lawyer shall not
terminate a representation until the lawyer has taken reasonable steps to avoid
reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the rights of the client, such as giving
the client sufficient notice to permit the client to retain other counsel.”  Because cross-defendants filed an anti-SLAPP
motion after Thomas & Elliott LLP filed this motion, additional steps must
be taken to protect cross-complainants from prejudice.  Moreover, due to the timing of events, the proposed
order and declaration served on the clients did not notify them of important
upcoming hearings.  The court therefore
will deny this motion without prejudice and continue the upcoming hearings.
  Thomas & Elliott LLP’s motion to be
relieved as counsel is denied without prejudice.  The court hereby continues the case
management conference and hearings on the demurrer and anti-SLAPP motion from
October 9, 2024, to December 10, 2024, at 9:00 a.m.
