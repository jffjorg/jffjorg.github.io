And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendants, Jeffrey Tamkin and Tamkin Development Corporation, have moved to stay the civil action pending the resolution of the criminal proceedings against Tamkin. The court has considered the factors outlined in Avant! Corp. v. Superior Court, including the potential prejudice to the plaintiff, the burden on the defendants, and the convenience of the court. The court has determined that the defendants have not shown a sufficient reason to justify a stay, and therefore, the motion is denied. The court has considered the fact that the criminal proceeding does not concern the plaintiff and that the defendants can assert their Fifth Amendment privilege to certain deposition questions or discovery requests. The court has also considered the public interest in a system that encourages individuals to come to court for the settlement of their disputes.
