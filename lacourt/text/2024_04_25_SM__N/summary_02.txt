And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has granted Plaintiff Jose Mejia's motion to compel inspection of the ladder and premises, ordering the parties to meet and confer to set an inspection date within 60 days. The Court finds good cause to order the simultaneous inspection, as Plaintiff's complaint alleges failure of the ladder and dangerous condition of the premises, and inspection of both is proper. The Court also denies Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, as Defendant was justified in refusing to allow the simultaneous inspection due to the burden and cost.
