[1] Respondents did not file a request for judicial
notice with their demurrer to the FAP, but they indicated in the notice that
the demurrer was based on a request for judicial notice.  (Dem. 2.) 
The court infers that Respondents intended to rely on the June 12, 2023,
request for judicial notice, which the court granted in its ruling on the prior
demurrer.  The court reaches the same
result on the instant demurrer even if judicial notice is not granted.  


[2] The second cause of action is a statutory claim for
waste pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 526a and the third cause of
action is a common law taxpayer action.  


[3]
“[T]he limitations inherent
in section 526a actions are founded in the
separation of powers principle of our tripartite system of government.” (Ibid.)
