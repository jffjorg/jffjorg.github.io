And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by the respondents to a complaint filed by the plaintiff. The respondents did not request judicial notice with their demurrer, but the judge infers that they intended to rely on a previous request for judicial notice filed on June 12, 2023. The judge grants the demurrer and reaches the same result even if judicial notice is not granted. The case involves two statutory claims: one for waste pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 526a and another common law taxpayer action. The judge notes that the limitations in section 526a actions are based on the separation of powers principle.
