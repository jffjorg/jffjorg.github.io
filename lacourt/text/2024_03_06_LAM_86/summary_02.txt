And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer to the first, second, and third causes of action is overruled. The case involves a dispute between Friends of Rockhaven and the City of Glendale over the City's failure to preserve Rockhaven Sanitarium Historic District, a historic property listed on the State and National Registries of Historic Resources and Places.

The City is alleged to have ignored experts' advice on measures to care for the property and has failed to take action to prevent its deterioration and decay. The City is also alleged to have wasted public funds and damaged public property by failing to comply with its duty to actively prevent the demolition by neglect, deterioration, dilapidation, and decay of the property.

The judge has found that Petitioner has sufficiently alleged a claim for writ of ordinary mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, as well as a common law taxpayer action under Code of Civil Procedure section 526a, based on the City's alleged failure to perform its mandatory duty to maintain the historic resource and its alleged waste of public funds and property.

The demurrer to the first cause of action, alleging a writ of ordinary mandate, was overruled because Petitioner has sufficiently alleged facts to support a claim that the City has abused its discretion and has caused a "demolition by neglect" within the meaning of Glendale Municipal Code section 15.20.120.

The demurrer to the second and third causes of action, alleging waste under Code of Civil Procedure section 526a, was also overruled because Petitioner has sufficiently alleged facts to support a claim that the City has engaged in "wasteful, improvident and completely unnecessary public spending" that may be enjoined pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 526a.
