And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is regarding a dispute between Steve Gordon, Director of the DMV, and the DMV. The parties had previously agreed to a settlement agreement, which included a hearing. However, the DMV argues that its hearing officers are not acting as advocates, but rather as finders of fact. The court disagrees, citing a previous case (CDLA) that defines advocating as putting on the DMV's case, and notes that the DMV's hearing officers are required to act as advocates. The court finds that the DMV's APS hearing process has fallen outside what is constitutionally permissible under CDLA, and that the DMV's hearing officers have become a prosecutor and advocate of the DMV's case. The court concludes that the DMV must know that its hearing officers are violating the injunction issued in CDLA, and that the DMV's argument that knowing violations of due process must be reviewed under harmless error analysis is flawed.
