And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a second motion to seal filed by Clothilde v. Hewlett, Commissioner of the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI). The motion concerns whether certain documents and portions thereof should be sealed from public view. The judge grants the motion in part, sealing all emails in Exhibit H and certain pages of Exhibit J and Exhibit C. The judge also denies the request to seal certain links and information contained in Exhibits E and F, finding that Hewlett has not provided sufficient justification to meet her burden on this motion. The judge orders Petitioner to prepare and file two amended requests for judicial notice within 10 days, which will be subject to public view.
