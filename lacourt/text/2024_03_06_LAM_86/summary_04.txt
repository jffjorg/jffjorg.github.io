```

The judge's tentative ruling grants the petition for a writ of mandate, vacates the DMV's decision to suspend Petitioner's driver's license, and remands the matter to the DMV for a new hearing. The ruling finds that the DMV's hearing officer acted as both an advocate for the DMV and a finder of fact, violating Petitioner's due process rights. The DMV's failure to comply with a final and binding order by the Court of Appeal is also considered a significant factor in the ruling.
