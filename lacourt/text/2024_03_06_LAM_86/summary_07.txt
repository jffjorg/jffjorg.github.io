And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies AFC CAL, LLC's application for a writ of possession against Maria Teresa Gonzalez over motor vehicles and trucks. The court finds that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate the probable location of the vehicles and therefore cannot grant the writ. Additionally, the court is not inclined to find that the defendant has been served with the summons and complaint. The ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and the Uniform Commercial Code, and cites relevant case law.
