```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the unopposed motion of defendant Noe Leonel Manzanarez to stay discovery in the case until the resolution of his pending criminal action. The motion is based on Manzanarez's Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, which may be violated if he is required to respond to discovery requests in the civil case. The parties have agreed to a stay to avoid unnecessary motion practice and to allow discovery to commence after the completion of the criminal matter. The judge notes that the parties' joint Case Management Statement sets forth the parties' agreement to a stay.
