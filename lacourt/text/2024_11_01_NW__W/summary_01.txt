Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for leave to amend their answer to the plaintiff's complaint. The defendants sought to add four new affirmative defenses, including failure to name indispensable parties, failure to exercise reasonable diligence, uncertainty and ambiguity, and no damages or injury. The judge found that the defendants had delayed in raising these issues and had not provided adequate explanation for the untimely motion. The judge also found that the new complaint filed by the plaintiff, naming additional defendants, did not support the defendants' claims that these parties are indispensable. The judge concluded that the defendants have not shown that the amendment is necessary or that it would not prejudice the plaintiff, and therefore denied the motion.
