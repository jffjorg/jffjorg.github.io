Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled that Plaintiff Dylan Scott Perry should be declared a vexatious litigant and impose a prefiling order under Code of Civil Procedure section 391.7. The court finds that Plaintiff has repeatedly filed lawsuits against the same defendants, which have been dismissed, and has made similar claims. The court also finds that Plaintiff has filed multiple lawsuits within the past seven years, which is a factor in determining vexatious litigant status. The court notes that Plaintiff has not provided any evidence indicating he should not be considered a vexatious litigant. The court concludes that a prefiling order is warranted to prevent Plaintiff from filing frivolous lawsuits in the future.
