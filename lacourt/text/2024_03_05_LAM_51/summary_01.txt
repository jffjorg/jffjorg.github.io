Summary in English text:

The Tentative Ruling is a written opinion by Judge Upinder S. Kalra in a lawsuit entitled Dylan Scott Perry v. Covered California, et al. The case involves a dispute over the cancellation of Plaintiff's medical insurance without notice. The Defendants, Covered California and L.A. Care, have filed demurrers to the Plaintiff's Verified First Amended Complaint, arguing that it fails to comply with the Government Claims Act and does not plead facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.

The Court has reviewed the pleadings and has sustained both demurrers, dismissing the complaint in its entirety without leave to amend. The Court found that the Plaintiff failed to comply with the Government Claims Act by presenting a claim to the Department of General Services (DGS) and did not plead facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for fraud.

The Court also found that the Plaintiff's objections to the demurrers were insufficient to overcome the defects in the pleadings and that leave to amend was not warranted. The Court has ordered the Clerk to note the dismissal in the register of actions and has directed each moving party to give notice.
