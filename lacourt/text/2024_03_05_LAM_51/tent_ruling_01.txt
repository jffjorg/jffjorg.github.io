STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On November 27, 2023, Plaintiff Dylan Scott Perry
(Plaintiff) filed a Verified Complaint against Defendant Covered California and
Local Initiative Health Authority for Los Angeles County d.b.a. L.A. Care
Health Plan, L.A. Care Plan de Salud (Defendants) with a cause of action for
fraud.
 
On November 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Verified First
Amended Complaint (FAC) for fraud and deceit. According to the FAC, Defendants
cancelled Plaintiff’s medical insurance without contacting Plaintiff.
 
On December 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Related
Case with Case No. 23STCV18928 in Dept. 57 and Case No. 23STCV18511in Dept. 62.
 
On December 27, 2023, Defendant Covered California (Covered
CA) filed a demurrer to the FAC.
 
On December 28, 2023, Defendant Local Initiative Health
Authority for Los Angeles County (L.A. Care) filed a demurrer to the FAC.
 
On January 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed an objection to Covered
CA’s demurrer.
 
On January 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed an objection to L.A.
Care’s demurrer.
 
On February 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for summary
adjudication.
 
On February 9, 2024, Covered California filed a reply in
support of its demurrer.
 
On February 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition to L.A.
Care’s demurrer.
 
L.A. Care’s reply was due on or before February 27, 2024. As
of February 29, 2024, there is no reply on file with the court.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Demurrer
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states
a cause of action.¿(Hahn v. Mirda¿(2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context.¿In a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the
evidence or other extrinsic matters. …. The only issue involved in a demurrer
hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous
matters, states a cause of action.”¿(Hahn¿147
Cal.App.4th at 747.)¿ 
 
Meet and Confer
 
Prior to filing a demurrer, the demurring party is required
to satisfy their meet and confer obligations pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc.
§430.41, and demonstrate that they so satisfied their meet and confer
obligation by submitting a declaration pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc.
§430.41(a)(2) & (3). According to the declaration of Michael
E. Byerts, Covered CA and Plaintiff met and conferred via telephone on December
4, 2023 but were unable to resolve the issues. (Byerts Decl. ¶ 3.) Similarly,
L.A. Care and Plaintiff met and conferred on December 21, 2023 and December 23,
2023. (Friedberg Decl. ¶¶ 3,4.) Accordingly, the meet and confer requirement is
met.
 
Request for
Judicial Notice
 
The court grants Covered CA’s
request for judicial notice as to Exhibit B. (Evid. Code § 452(d), (h);
See Kalnoki v. First American
Trustee Servicing Solutions, LLC (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 23,37.) However, the
court only takes judicial notice of the foregoing documents only as to “the
existence, content and authenticity of public records and other specified
documents”; it does not take judicial notice of the truth of the factual
matters asserted in those documents. (Dominguez
v. Bonta (2022) 87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.)¿The court denies Plaintiff’s
request for judicial notice.
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Covered CA contends that Plaintiff failed to comply with the
Government Claims Act and failed to sufficiently plead fraud. L.A. Care also
contends that Plaintiff failed to sufficiently plead fraud and that the FAC is
uncertain.[1]
Plaintiff argues he did submit a claim to the Department of General Services
(DGS) and that he did sufficiently plead fraud. 
 
Government Claims
Act
 
The Government Tort Claims Act governs tort actions against
public entities and public employees. A lawsuit that seeks monetary damages
from a public employee or entity must be preceded by the presentation of a
claim to the public entity and action on the claim by the Claims Board. (Gov.
Code §§ 905, 911.2, 945.4; Briggs v.
Lawrence (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 605, 612.) A plaintiff must allege, as an
element of his or her claim against the public entity or employee, that the
claim has been presented to the public entity. (Shirk v. Vista Unified School Dist. (2007) 42 Cal.4th 201, 209.)
Presentation of the claim and a Claims Board action on or rejection of the
claim are conditions precedent to suit. (State
of California v. Superior Court (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1234, 1245.) 
 
This rule serves the policy underling the claims statutes by
(1) providing public entities with sufficient information to allow them to
investigate and evaluate the merits of the claim while the evidence is still
fresh and witnesses are available; (2) affording the opportunity to settle
claims without the expenditure of public funds on litigation; and (3) informing
the public entity of potential liability so it can better prepare for the
upcoming fiscal year. (See Munoz v. State
of California (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1767, 1776.)
 
Plaintiff must allege, as an element of his claim against Covered
CA, that the claim has been presented to the proper public entity. (Shirk, supra, at p. 209.) The FAC is
devoid of any allegation showing that Plaintiff complied with the Government
Tort Claims Act by presenting a timely government claim to Covered CA. Plaintiff’s
claim to DGS included with his objection/opposition to demurrer indicates he
presented the claim on October 12, 2023. However, the court cannot consider
extrinsic evidence when ruling on a demurrer. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) Even
though Plaintiff has not requested that the court take judicial notice of this
document, Covered CA has. (Covered CA Request for Judicial Notice, Exhibit B.) It
still would not help Plaintiff, though, because the document does not indicate
Covered CA included on the claim.
 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS Covered CA’s demurrer to
the FAC in its entirety for failure to comply with the Government Claims Act.
 
Fraud
 
The elements of fraud are: “(a) misrepresentation (false
representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or
‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable
reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Charnay
v. Cobert (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 184.) “The particularity demands that
a plaintiff plead facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means
the representations were tendered.” (Cansino
v. Bank of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469; Perlas v. GMAC Mort., LLC (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 429, 434
[requiring plaintiffs who claim fraud against a corporation to allege the names
of the persons who made the misrepresentations, their authority to speak for
the corporation, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was
said or written.]) Fraud allegations need not be liberally construed, general
pleading of the legal conclusion of fraud is insufficient, and every element of
the cause of action for fraud must be alleged fully, factually and
specifically. (Wilhelm v. Pray, Price,
Williams & Russell (1986) 186 Cal. App. 3d 1324, 1331.)¿ 
 
The
court has reviewed the operative FAC and it does not sufficiently plead a cause
of action for fraud by Covered CA or by L.A. Care. Notably, Plaintiff has not
identified who made the representation on behalf of either entity defendant and
their authority to speak on behalf of the entity defendant, what the alleged
misrepresentation was, or when it occurred.[2] Plaintiff concludes
fraudulent conduct but lacks the requisite specificity.
 
Accordingly,
the court SUSTAINS L.A. Care’s demurrer to the FAC in its entirety.[3] 
 
Leave to Amend
 
Leave to amend should be liberally granted if there is a
reasonable possibility an amendment could cure the defect.¿ (County of Santa Clara v. Superior Court
(2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 1018,1035.)¿ The Plaintiff has the burden of
demonstrating that leave to amend should be granted, and that the defects can
be cured by amendment. (“Plaintiff must show in what manner he can amend his
complaint and how that amendment will change the legal effect of his pleading.”
(Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d
335, 349).
 
Here, leave to amend is not warranted. First, Plaintiff
filed substantively similar, if not identical, complaints arising from the same
underlying facts against the same parties in different departments that have
been voluntarily dismissed. (See 23STCV18511 (voluntarily dismissed) and 23STCV18928
(voluntarily dismissed).) Plaintiff has filed similar lawsuits against
different parties that were dismissed after demurrer or voluntarily. (See 22STCV03956
(demurrer sustained), 22STCV27904 (demurrer sustained), and 23STCV16396
(plaintiff’s oral motion to dismiss).) Second, Plaintiff has not requested
leave to amend and has not indicated specific allegations that would cure the
deficiencies in his pleadings. Finally, Plaintiff indicated he could not cure
the fraud allegations because he stated in his Verified Objection to L.A.
Care’s Demurrer that he is “not claiming an injury was caused by an intentional
misrepresentation by an employee.” (Plaintiff’s Verified Objection to Opponents
(Local Initiative’s) Demurrer, 4:14-17.)
 
Accordingly, leave to amend is DENIED.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.Covered CA’s Demurrer to the FAC
is SUSTAINED in its entirety without leave to amend.
2. L.A. Care’s Demurrer to the FAC
is SUSTAINED in its entirety without leave to amend.
Pursuant
to CCP § 581d, this written order of dismissal constitutes a judgment and shall
be effective for all purposes. The Clerk shall note this judgment in the
register of actions in this case.¿
 
Each moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
