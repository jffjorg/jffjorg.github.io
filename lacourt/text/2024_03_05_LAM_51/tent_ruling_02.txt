L.A. Care also contends it is absolutely immune from liability for alleged
false representations under Gov. Code § 818.8 but did not include this in their
notice of demurrer. The court declines to analyze this argument at this time
because it would be a duplicative means of sustaining the demurrer.

Indeed, Plaintiff
states: “I am not claiming that an injury was caused by an intentional
misrepresentation by an employee. I am claiming that an injury was caused by
the Government of the State of California i.e. Covered California and Local
Initiative Health Authority as a whole, or failure of the elected governing
boards of the companies.” (Plaintiff’s Verified Objection to
Opponents (Local Initiative’s) Demurrer, 4:14-17.) “To be considered a binding
judicial admission, the declaration or utterance must be one of fact and not a
legal conclusion, contention, or argument.” (Travelers Indemnity Company of Connecticut v. Navigators Specialty
Insurance Company (2021) 70 Cal.App.5th 341, 360-361.) In light of this
statement, the court does not see how Plaintiff could allege his claim for
fraud in good faith.

The court could also sustain Covered CA’s demurrer on this ground.

On February 9, 2024, the Court continued a previously-set
OSC hearing to March 5, 2024 concerning whether Plaintiff should be declared a
vexatious litigant.
 
On February 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for summary
adjudication.
 
 
LEGAL STANDARD & ANALYSIS: 
 
“The vexatious litigant statute (§§ 391-391.7) was enacted
in 1963 to curb misuse of the court system by those acting in propria persona
who repeatedly relitigate the same issues. Their abuse of the system not only
wastes court time and resources but also prejudices other parties waiting their
turn before the courts.”  (In re Bittaker¿(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th
1004, 1008.)   
 
“A ‘vexatious litigant’ [includes a person] who,” in
substance: 
(1)   within
the last seven years has “commenced, prosecuted, or maintained in propria
persona at least five litigations … that have been finally determined adversely
to the person; 
(2)   repeatedly
litigates, in propria persona, the validity of an action, or refiles litigation
based on substantially the same issues and facts, against the same defendants
after the matter has been finally determined adversely to the person; 
(3)   “[i]n
any litigation while acting in propria persona, repeatedly files unmeritorious
motions, pleadings, or other papers, conducts unnecessary discovery, or engages
in other tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary
delay[;]” or 
(4)   has
been determined to be a vexatious litigant in another court, state or federal. 
(CCP § 391, subd. (b), emphasis added.)
 
"Litigation," for purposes of
determining vexatious litigant status, means "any civil action or
proceeding, commenced, maintained or pending in any state or federal
court." (CCP § 391, subd. (a), emphasis added.) The term includes appeals
and writ petitions. (McColm v. Westwood
Park Association (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1211, emphasis added.)  
 
Plaintiff
has not provided any evidence indicating he should not be considered a
vexatious litigant.
 
Here, the court has evidence of two prior
actions against the same defendants in the instant action that were previously
dismissed. (CCP § 391(b)(2).) Those matters are: Los Angeles County Superior
Court Case Nos. 23STCV18511 and 23STCV18928. The complaints are also factually
identical, meaning, they concern the same underlying insurance (or lack of
insurance) claim. 
 
The court also has evidence of at least give
litigations . . . that have been finally determined adversely to the person.
(CCP § 391(b)(1).) Indeed, each of the five prior cases were either voluntarily
dismissed or dismissed after demurrers were sustained without leave to amend. Those
matters are: Los Angeles County Superior Court Case Nos. 22STCV03956,
22STCV27904, and 23STCV16396. A¿particular litigation is finally
determined when avenues for direct review (appeal) have been exhausted or the
time for appeal has expired. (Childs v.
PaineWebber Incorporated¿(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 982, 993–994, emphasis
added.) For the matters sustained without leave, the time for appeal has
passed. Additionally, any actions the pro per plaintiff has filed and dismissed
counts for the purpose of the vexatious litigant statute, even if the dismissal
is voluntary and without prejudice, as they still burden the judicial system
and the target of the litigation. (Tokerud
v. Capitol Bank Sacramento (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 775, 779, emphasis added). 
 
 
The court finds that a prefiling order pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 391.7 is warranted. 
Plaintiff Dylan Scott Perry may not file any new litigation in the
courts of the State of California in propria persona without first obtaining
leave of the presiding justice or presiding judge of the court where litigation
is proposed to be filed, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 391.7,
subdivision (a).  Disobedience of the
order may be punished by a contempt of court. 

 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED. 
 
Dated:              March 5, 2024                         __________________________________                                                                                                                Upinder
