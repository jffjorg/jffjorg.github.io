Summary in English:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the Defendant, granting the motion to compel arbitration. The Judge found that the Defendant has satisfied its initial burden to show that there are arbitration agreements that exist between the Defendant and each Plaintiff. The Judge also concluded that the signature procured on September 16, 2022 was not the result of economic duress and that there is a slight degree of procedural unconscionability due to the arbitration agreements being adhesion contracts and the lack of arbitration rules in some agreements. The Judge declined to find that the arbitration agreements are unconscionable and denied the Plaintiffs' request for an evidentiary hearing.
