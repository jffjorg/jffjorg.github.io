And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's complaint, which alleges that the defendants negligently owned, operated, and/or entrusted a motor vehicle that caused a collision. The defendants argued that the corporation, Williams Sewer Line Inspectors LLC, was dissolved de facto due to its suspension by the California Secretary of State. However, the court found that the defendants failed to properly meet and confer with the plaintiff's counsel prior to filing the motion, and that the motion was an improper vehicle to remove a defendant from the action. The court also found that the defendants' argument was based on a screenshot of an internet page, which is inadmissible evidence, and that the defendants' reliance on a previous court case was misplaced. The court warned the defendants and their counsel to take the meet and confer obligations seriously and to avoid violating the rules of court.
