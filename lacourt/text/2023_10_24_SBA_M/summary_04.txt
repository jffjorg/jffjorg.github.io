English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has considered the moving and reply papers in this case, and has decided to continue the hearing to allow the defendants to file their opposition and for the court to consider the matter further. The plaintiff, Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Company, seeks to attach the property of Kaladar Co., Inc. et al. to secure the recovery on its claim for breach of contract. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants failed to hold it harmless and indemnify it against claims made against the bond. The court notes that the defendants have failed to provide any evidence to support their defenses to the claims. The court also notes that the defendants have served discovery on the plaintiff, requesting that it identify and produce evidence to support its position that it properly defended and settled the two underlying claims. The court will consider the defendants' opposition and will issue a further ruling at a later date.
