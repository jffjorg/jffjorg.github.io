Summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a Superior Court of California case (Case Number: 19TRCV00125). The case involves a dispute between KURT BAKER, et al. (plaintiffs) and REDONDO RIVIERA ASSOCIATES, LLC (defendant) over allegations of breach of contract, fraud, and negligence. Cross-defendant Derek McLay has requested summary judgment, arguing that he was not a party to the lease or partner in a partnership that was a party to the lease, and therefore is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. The court has granted the motion to continue to allow the moving party to file the declaration of Kurt Baker in support of the motion.
