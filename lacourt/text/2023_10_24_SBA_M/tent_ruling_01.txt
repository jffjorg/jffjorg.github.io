RULING
            The motion for summary judgment is CONTINUED

support of the motion for summary judgment. 

BACKGROUND
            On February 5, 2019, Kurt Baker,
individual dba as Riviera Fitness, LLC and Dustin Holcomb, ind. dba as Riviera
Fitness, LLC filed a complaint against Redondo Riviera Associates, LLC for (1)
fraud, (2) breach of contract, (3) breach of covenant of good faith and fair
dealing, and (4) rescission.
            On April 8, 2019, plaintiffs filed a
FAC for (1) fraud-concealment, (2) fraud-false representation, (3) breach of
contract, (4) breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (5) gross
negligence, and (6) rescission.
            On June 17, 2019, the parties
stipulated, and the court ordered that plaintiffs were to file a second amended
complaint.  The SAC alleges causes of
action for (1) fraud-concealment, (2) fraud-false representation, (3) negligent
misrepresentation, (4) breach of contract, (5) breach of covenant of good faith
and fair dealing, (6) gross negligence, and (7) rescission.
            On September 5, 2019, the court
overruled defendant’s demurrer to SAC as to the 4th and 5th
causes of action and sustained with leave to amend as to the 6th
cause of action.
            On September 25, 2019, Redondo
Riviera Associates, LLC filed a cross-complaint against Kurt Baker, Dustin
Holcomb, and Derek McLay for breach of contract.
            On December 31, 2019, the court sustained
with leave to amend cross-defendant McLay’s demurrer to the cross-complaint
because he was not a party to the lease and not a signatory to the lease.
            On January 22, 2020, Redondo Riviera
Associates filed a FACC for breach of contract.
            On June 29, 2020, the court
sustained with leave to amend Derek McLay’s demurrer to FACC.
            On July 24, 2020, Redondo Rivera
Associates filed a SACC for breach of contract.
            On September 29, 2020, the court
overruled McLay’s demurrer to the SACC.
            On February 9, 2022, the court
denied McLay’s motion for summary judgment as to the SACC finding that there
was a triable issue of material fact as to whether McLay was a partner with
Baker and Holcomb in a partnership.
            On April 20, 2022, the court denied
defendant Redondo Riviera’s motion for summary adjudication as to the 3rd,
4th, and 5th causes of action and granted it as to the 6th
cause of action.
            On June 21, 2022, the court denied
without prejudice plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file a TAC.
            On September 26, 2022, the case was reassigned
to Dept. 8 in Inglewood.
            On October 24, 2022, the case was
reassigned to Dept. M.
            On January 24, 2023, the court
granted plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file a TAC to add Riviera Fitness, LLC
as a separate plaintiff.  Plaintiffs
filed the TAC.
            On May 17, 2023, at the hearing on
defendant’s demurrer, the parties stipulated that a Fourth Amended Complaint
may be filed.
            On May 30, 2023, plaintiffs filed a
Fourth Amended Complaint.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
The purpose of a motion for summary
judgment or summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.”  Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal. 4th 826, 843.  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal. App. 4th 1110, 1119.
“On a motion for summary judgment,
the initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing
that there are no triable issues of material fact.”  Scalf
v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal. App. 4th 1510, 1519.  A defendant moving for summary judgment or
summary adjudication “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of
action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the
cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete
defense to the cause of action.”  CCP §
437c(p)(2).  “Once the defendant . . .
has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.” CCP § 437c(p)(2).  
“When deciding whether to grant
summary judgment, the court must consider all of the evidence set forth in the
papers (except evidence to which the court has sustained an objection), as well
as all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence, in the light
most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.” Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal. App.
4th 463, 467; CCP §437c(c).
DISCUSSION
Cross-defendant
Derek McLay requests summary judgment in favor of McLay and against
cross-complainant Redondo Riviera Associates, LLC on the grounds that no
triable issue of material fact exists as McLay was not a party to the lease or
partner in a partnership that was a party to the lease and that McLay is
entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.
The court
notes that moving party cites to the declaration of Kurt Baker and that the
opposition filed evidentiary objections. 
The declaration of Derek McLay was filed twice.  The declaration of Kurt Baker was not filed.
Accordingly,
the motion is CONTINUED to allow moving party to file the Baker declaration.
