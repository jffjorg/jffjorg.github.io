The summary text:

The Judge issues a tentative ruling in the case of Christopher Tran Quach v. Volkswagen Group of America et al. The case involves a complaint for negligent repair of a 2021 Audi, Q7 VIN: WA1VXBF75MD020643. The Defendant, Rusnak/Pasadena, demurred to the complaint, arguing that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is barred by the economic loss rule. The Judge sustains the demurrer with leave to amend, requiring the Plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 20 days. The Judge notes that the complaint is insufficient to state a claim for negligent repair and that the economic loss rule applies. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff's allegations of negligent repair appear to be at odds with his allegations under the Song-Beverly Act and requires clarification in any amended pleading.
