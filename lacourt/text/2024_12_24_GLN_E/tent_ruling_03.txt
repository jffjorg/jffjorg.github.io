RELIEF REQUESTED: Defendant Rusnak/Pasadena (“Defendant”)
demurrers to Plaintiff Christopher Tran Quach’s (“Plaintiff”) fourth cause of
action for negligent repair for lack to state sufficient facts and as a matter
of law. (Not. at p.3.) Moreover, the negligent repair cause of action is barred
by the economic loss rule. (Not. at p.3.)
 
BACKGROUND: This lemon law action
arises from Plaintiff Christopher Tran Quach’s purchase of a 2021 Audi, Q7 VIN:
WA1VXBF75MD020643 (the “subject vehicle”) on or about December 29, 2020.
Plaintiff alleges various violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act,
in addition to allegations of Negligent Repair (fourth cause of action) against
Defendant. 
 
On October 28, 2024, Defendant
filed the instant demurrer. 
 
On November 22, 2024, the hearing
was continued to December 13, 2024, and Plaintiff filed an amended complaint. However,
the amended complaint was rejected by the Court.  
 
RECOMMENDED RULING: The Court
SUSTAINS the demurrer WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. Plaintiff is ordered to file an
amended complaint within 20 days of this order. 
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Legal Standard
 
When any ground for objection to a complaint appears on the
face thereof, the objection on that ground may be taken by demurrer to the
pleading. (Cal. Code Civ. Pro. § 430.30(a).) A demurrer to a complaint may be taken
either to the whole complaint or to any of the causes of action stated therein.
(Cal. Code. Civ. Pro. 430.50(a).) California Code of Civil Procedure §430.10
provides that a party may file a demurrer if “[]he pleading does not state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” “A demurrer tests the
sufficiency of the complaint by raising questions of law.” (Boxer v. City of
Beverly Hills, 246 Cal. App. 4th 1212, 1217 (2016) (citing Aragon–Haas
v. Family Security Ins. Services, Inc., 231 Cal.App.3d 232, 238 (1991).) “A
general demurrer admits the truth of all material factual allegations of the
complaint, but not the truth of contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact
or law.” (Id. (citing Moore v. Regents of University of California,
51 Cal.3d 120, 125 (1990).) In determining whether leave to amend
should be granted, courts must consider “whether there is a
reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.” (Blank v.
Kirwan, 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 (1985).)
 
Discussion
 
Meet and Confer
 
CCP § 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer
pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person
or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to
demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached
that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (CCP §
430.41(a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the
date the responsive pleading is due. (CCP § 430.41(a)(2).) Thereafter, the
demurring party shall file and serve a declaration detailing their meet and
confer efforts. (CCP § 430.41(a)(3).)
 
Defendant’s counsel states that she met and conferred with Plaintiff’s
counsel prior to the filing of the demurrer. (Declaration of Simpson-James (“Simpson-James
Decl.”) ¶¶ 4-7.) Thus, the meet and confer requirements are satisfied.  
 
Fourth Cause of Action for Negligent Repair 
 
Defendant Rusnak/Pasadena argues that Plaintiff’s Fourth
Cause of Action (Negligent Repair) fails to state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action against Defendant Rusnak/Pasadena and is barred by
the Economic Loss Rule. (CCP 430.10(e).)
 
The necessary
elements for negligence are: (1) the existence of a legal duty of care that the
defendant owed to the plaintiff; (2) breach; (3) causation; and (4)
damages.  (County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2006)
137 Cal.App.4th 292, 318 (Atlantic Richfield); see CACI No. 1220.)
 
Under the
economic-loss rule, a plaintiff is precluded from recovery in tort where his
damages consist solely of an economic loss.  (Seely v. White Motor Co.
(1965) 63 Cal.2d 9, 17-18.)  “California Courts define economic
loss as ‘damages for inadequate value, costs of repair and replacement of the
defective product or consequent loss of profits—without any claim of personal
injury or damages to other property.’”  (Department of Water &
Power v. ABB Power T & D Co. (C.D.Cal. 1995) 902 F.Supp. 1178, 1186, fn.
4.)  
 
Here, the complaint alleges “Plaintiff delivered the Subject
Vehicle to Defendant AUDI PASADENA for repairs on numerous occasions. (Complaint
¶ 65.) Defendant AUDI PASADENA owed a duty to Plaintiff to use ordinary care
and skill in storage, preparation, and repair of the Subject Vehicle in
accordance with industry standards. (Id. at 66.) Defendant AUDI PASADENA
breached its duty to Plaintiff to ordinary care and skill by failing to
properly store, prepare, and repair of the Subject Vehicle in accordance with
industry standards. (Id. at 67.)  Defendant AUDI PASADENA’s negligent breach of
its duties owed to Plaintiff was a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s damages. (Id.
at 68.) These alleged facts are insufficient to state a cause of action for
negligent repair because they are conclusory allegations. 
 
Plaintiff has failed to allege duty, breach, causation, and damages
due to Defendant’s negligence, the complaint is insufficient to state a claim
for negligent repair. (CACI No. 1220.) Further, since Plaintiff alleges a
purely economic loss in his complaint, his negligent repair cause of action is
also barred as a matter of law. (Exh. A at p. 9:14-15.) (Atlantic
Richfield, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th at p. 318 (“economic loss alone,
without physical injury, does not amount to type of damage that causes
negligence cause of action to accrue). Notably, Plaintiff did not file an
opposition. Thus, the demurrer will be sustained. 
 
The trial court
shall extend a plaintiff leave to amend her pleading where stands a reasonable
chance of curing defect in question.  (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City
of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146 (CLD Construction).)
 
Here, the Court
finds it highly unlikely that Plaintiff can successfully amend his complaint to
cure the defects identified in this ruling without violating the sham pleading
doctrine. (State of California ex rel. Metz v. CCC Information
Services, Inc. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 402, 412 (under sham pleading
doctrine, plaintiffs are precluded from amending complaints to omit harmful
allegations, without explanation, from previous complaints to avoid attacks
raised in demurrers or motions for summary judgment).)  However, in line
with the general principle that a plaintiff should be afforded every
opportunity to amend their pleading where the amendment is feasible, the Court
will sustain the demurrer with leave to amend.  (CLD Construction, supra,
120 Cal.App.4th at p. 1146.)
 
In any amended pleading, Plaintiff will be strictly
required to plead facts that clearly show why the economic loss rule does not
apply to his negligence claim against Defendant in this case. Plaintiff
will also need to plead allegations showing that Defendant’s conduct resulted
in damages.  Otherwise, the Court intends to summarily sustain any
demurrer by Plaintiff to the amended pleading, without leave to
amend. 
 
The Court also notes that
Plaintiff’s allegations of negligent repair appear to be at odds with his
allegations under the Song-Beverly Act.  If the car is a “lemon” and has
an incurable defect, how can the repairs be negligent? Alternatively, if
the car was repairable, but Defendants conducted its repairs negligently, how
can Plaintiff have a cause of action under the lemon law? Plaintiff should
specify the nature of his claims to clarify this confusion in any amended
pleading. 
 
Accordingly, the Court SUSTAINS
the demurrer WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. Plaintiff is ordered to file his First Amended
Complaint within thirty (30) days of this order.
