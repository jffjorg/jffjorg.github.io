And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant to provide code-compliant verifications with respect to its responses to the plaintiff's discovery requests. The plaintiff had propounded the discovery requests on July 26, 2023, and the defendant had served separate responses on September 15, 2024. However, the defendant failed to provide verifications, and the plaintiff had made several attempts to meet and confer regarding the deficiencies. The judge has ordered the defendant to provide code-compliant verifications within 10 days following the hearing of this motion.

Additionally, the judge has awarded sanctions of $1,215.00 against the defendant and its attorney of record, jointly and severally, for the defendant's failure to provide verifications and engage in evasive responses to the discovery requests. The plaintiff's attorney had spent 2.8 hours drafting the motion, 0.5 hours attending the hearing, and incurred a $60.00 filing fee, and had requested a total of $1,635.00 in sanctions. The judge has reduced the amount of sanctions to $1,215.00, taking into account the plaintiff's counsel's actual time spent on the motion.
