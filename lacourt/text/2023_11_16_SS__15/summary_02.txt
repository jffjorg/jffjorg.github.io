And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Charter Communications, Inc. (Defendant) in response to the Second Amended Complaint filed by Gerardo Martinez (Plaintiff). The Plaintiff alleged causes of action against the Defendant for negligence and fraud.

The judge found that the Plaintiff's negligence cause of action is barred by the Privette doctrine, which holds that a contractor hiring an independent contractor is not liable for torts to the independent contractor's employees during the performance of inherently dangerous work. The judge also found that the Plaintiff's fraud cause of action is deficient because it does not allege with specificity all of the elements of a fraudulent concealment cause of action.

The judge further found that the Plaintiff's cause of action for fraudulent and intentional misrepresentations is also deficient because it does not allege with specificity any knowingly false representation by the Defendant to the Plaintiff, nor does it allege that the Defendant intended to deceive the Plaintiff or that the Plaintiff justifiably relied on any specific false representation made by the Defendant.

Based on these findings, the judge sustained the demurrer and motion to strike, and denied the Plaintiff's request to amend the complaint. The judge also found that the Plaintiff has had three opportunities to plead adequately its causes of action against the Defendant, and that the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.
