And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel deposition and documents filed by the plaintiffs. The motion was filed in response to the defendant's objections to the plaintiffs' deposition notice. The defendant, The Boeing Company, has been served with requests for information related to asbestos on its aircraft, as well as reports, studies, and memos about asbestos on the aircraft, information about handling asbestos-containing materials, correspondence about asbestos, and the sources of all asbestos products on the aircraft. The judge has denied most of the requests, finding that they are overbroad and seek irrelevant information. The judge has also denied requests for information about contracts and related documents for all aircraft sold to Continental before 2010, as well as requests for information about maintenance and repair documents relating to aircraft sold to Continental before 2010. The judge has concluded that the information sought is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and has denied the motion to compel.
