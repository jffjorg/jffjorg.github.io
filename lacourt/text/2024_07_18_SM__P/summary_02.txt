And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the demurrer filed by defendants Mountainfield P01, LLC, Nassir, and Alfa Real Estate Group LLC to the fifth, eighth, and ninth causes of action. The complaint alleges that defendant Nassir changed the equity structure of the venture, signed loan documents on plaintiff Toxboe's behalf without permission, and undermined plaintiffs' interests. The judge grants the defendants' request for judicial notice of the property deed and Redemption Agreement, but overrules their arguments that rely on outside evidence.

The judge finds that the complaint adequately states a cause of action for dissolution of partnership, as the plaintiffs have alleged that defendant Nassir made representations to them regarding the equity structure and that it is not reasonably practicable to carry on the activities of the limited partnership in conformity with the partnership agreement.

The judge also finds that the complaint adequately states a cause of action for judicial foreclosure, as the plaintiffs have alleged that they invested with Nassir, recorded liens against the property, and issued notices of default when Nassir failed to pay. The judge overrules the defendants' argument that the claim is uncertain and unclear.

Finally, the judge finds that the complaint adequately states a cause of action for partition, as the plaintiffs have alleged that they have an interest in Mountainfield and that the property is owned by several persons concurrently or in successive estates. The judge overrules the defendants' argument that the plaintiffs fail to state a claim because they do not have any ownership in the property.

The judge's ruling is based on the following legal principles: a demurrer is not the appropriate procedure for determining the truth of disputed facts; the court assumes the truth of the facts alleged in the complaint and the reasonable inferences that may be drawn from those facts; and the court cannot consider evidence not judicially noticed.
