And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Defendant Timothy Wickham's motion to stay the civil proceedings pending the outcome of the criminal charges against him. The motion was filed in response to Geske's General Engineering, Inc.'s lawsuit against Wickham Group, Inc., William Wickham, Wickham Group, LLC, Timothy Wickham, and Tyerman, alleging failure to pay for subcontracting services on a residential construction project. The Judge notes that while Wickham's Fifth Amendment rights may be implicated by some discovery requests, he can object to individual items of discovery on privilege grounds, rather than seeking a stay of the entire proceedings. The Judge also considers the potential prejudice to the plaintiff and cross-complainant if the proceedings are stayed indefinitely, as well as the ability of other defendants who do not face criminal prosecution to respond to and participate in discovery.
