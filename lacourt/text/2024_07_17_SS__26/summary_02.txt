The tentative ruling continues the Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award filed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA against Gerard C. Tcheumani, et al. to October 16, 2024 at 8:30 am in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse. The Petitioner must file a proof of service of the petition and notice of hearing that conforms to the statutory requirements by September 10, 2024. Failure to do so may result in the petition being denied. The Court notes that no proof of service of the petition has been filed and only proof of service of the notice of hearing has been filed, which was served by electronic mail. The arbitration agreement does not specify the manner of service, and therefore, the petition and notice of hearing must be served in the manner provided by law for the service of a summons.
