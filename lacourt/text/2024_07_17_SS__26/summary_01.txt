And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Cross-Defendants Gomez Law, APC and James Hornbuckle. The motion was based on the argument that the remaining causes of action in the Cross-Complaint (professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty) can only be proved by an expert witness, and that Cross-Complainant has failed to designate any expert witness. However, the motion did not provide any specific allegations from the Cross-Complaint or ask the court to take judicial notice of any matter outside the pleadings. Instead, it relied on case law and unsupported arguments. The judge found that the opposition declaration filed by Cross-Complainant failed to meet the requirements of Cal. Rules of Court rule 3.1113(b) and therefore did not consider it in making its decision.
