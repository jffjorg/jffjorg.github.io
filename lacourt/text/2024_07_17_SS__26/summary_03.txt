And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lawsuit filed by Adolfo W. Contreras against Ariel Malamud, MD, and White Memorial H. (MRI Dept). The lawsuit alleges negligence and discrimination, but the judge has ruled that the complaint fails to sufficiently state a cause of action. Specifically, the judge has found that the complaint does not adequately allege negligence, intentional tort, age discrimination, or social status. The judge has also found that the complaint does not comply with the requirements of the California Civil Rights Act and the Unruh Act. As a result, the judge has sustained the defendant's demurrer to the complaint and denied the plaintiff's request for leave to amend. The judge has also placed the defendant's motion to strike portions of the complaint off the calendar as moot.
