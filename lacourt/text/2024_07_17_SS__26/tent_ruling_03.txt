ANALYSIS: 
 

On April 24, 2024, Plaintiff
Adolfo W. Contreras (“Plaintiff”), in propria persona, filed the Complaint in
this action against Defendants Ariel Malamud, MD (“Defendant Malamud”) and White
Memorial H. (MRI Dept) (“Defendant White Memorial”). Defendant Malamud filed the
instant Demurrer to, and Motion to Strike Portions of, the Complaint on June 6, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
The Demurrer is accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure section
430.41. (Demurrer, Hughes Decl., ¶¶2-5.) The Demurrer is brought on the grounds
that the Complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action
and is uncertain. (Demurrer, p. 2:2-12.) Special demurrers, however, are not
permitted in the limited jurisdiction court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 92, subd.
(c).) Therefore, the Court will not rule on the demurrer for uncertainty. The failure
to allege sufficient facts argument is directed at the following causes of
action: (1) negligence per se; (2) intentional tort; (3) age discrimination;
and (4) social status. The Court notes that the causes of action listed on the
face page of the Complaint do not match those set forth within the Complaint
itself. Those causes of action are called: (1) civil penalties: negligence per
se & discrimination; (2) discrimination based on age and the exercise of
protected rights; (3) retaliation in violation of the California Civil Rights
Act; and (4) failure to prevent discrimination and negligence per se. 
 
Regarding negligence per se,
Defendant points out that there is no such cause of action. Instead, negligence
per se is a theory that creates a rebuttable presumption of negligence due to
violation of a statute enacted to protect a class of persons, of which the
plaintiff is a member, from the type of harm the plaintiff suffered. (Quiroz
v. Seventh Ave. Center (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1285.) The Complaint is
largely incomprehensible. It seems to allege that Defendant denied Plaintiff
medical services but does not indicate how this amounts to negligence, i.e.,
the breach of a duty that caused Plaintiff damages. (Peredia v. HR Mobile
Services, Inc. (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 680, 687.) 
 
The causes of action pertaining
to age discrimination appear to be based on the California Civil Rights Act,
set forth at Civil Code section 51, et seq. Plaintiff must plead facts that
demonstrate intentional discrimination in public accommodations in violation of
the the Unruh Act. (Munson v. Del Taco, Inc. (2009) 46 Cal.4th 661, 668
[citing Harris v. Capital Growth Investors XIV (1991) 52 Cal.3d 1142,
1172].) There are no specific allegations as to how Defendant Malamud violated
Plaintiff’s civil rights or even what intentional conduct is attributed to
Defendant Malamud. Instead, the Complaint broadly alleges that Defendants’
policies and practices denied Plaintiff equal medical treatment. (Compl., p.
6:19-21.) This is not sufficient to allege a statutory violation, which must be
alleged with particularity as to each element of the cause of action. (Richardson-Tunnell
v. Schools Ins. Program for Employees (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 1056, 1061.)
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant
Malamud’s Demurrer to the Complaint is sustained. Nor has Plaintiff filed any
opposition demonstrating that the pleading can be amended to assert a viable
cause of action, as is their burden. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18
Cal.3d 335, 348.) Leave to amend is denied.
 
In light of the ruling on the
Demurrer, Defendant Malamud’s Motion to Strike Portions of the Complaint is placed
off calendar as moot.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Ariel Malamud, MD’s
Demurrer to the Complaint is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
Defendant Ariel Malamud, MD’s
Motion to Strike Portions of the Complaint is PLACED OFF CALENDAR AS MOOT.
