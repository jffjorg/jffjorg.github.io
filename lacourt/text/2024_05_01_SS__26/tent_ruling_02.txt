ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiffs 2515 Thurman, LLC and Brian Haydel (“Plaintiffs”)
filed the instant (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set
One, and Request For Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Deem Requests for Admission,
Set One, Admitted, and Request For Sanctions on March 7, 2024. Defendants Trinton
Hurt, Eddie Mendez, and Chris Jimenez (“Defendants”) filed a oppositions on
March 11, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiffs contend they propounded Form Interrogatories, Set
One, and Requests for Admission, Set One, on Defendants on March 1, 2024.
(Motions, Poulter Decl., Exh. 1.) Only the Requests for Admission, Set One, is
accompanied by a proof of service which indicates it was served by electronic
mail. (Motion to Deem RFAs Admitted, Poulter Decl., Exh. 1, p. 4.) Plaintiffs
contend that responses were due by March 6, 2024 without citation to any legal
authority. (Motions, p. 3:5.) The oppositions, however, point to the relevant
authority regarding service of discovery responses in an unlawful detainer
action. Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.260, subdivision (b) provides that
responses are due within five days, and this time is extended by two court days
for service by electronic mail. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).)
Therefore, Defendants’ responses were not due until March 8, 2024. 

As Defendants point out, Plaintiffs prematurely filed these
Motions on March 7, 2024 and in an apparent attempt to recover sanctions
awarded against Plaintiffs. (Opp., Greer Decl., ¶4 and Exh. A.) The Motions,
therefore, are denied. Defendants are also entitled to an award of monetary
sanctions pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a)
for “unsuccessfully asserting that [Defendants] engaged in the misuse of the
discovery process.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) Defendants
are awarded reduced sanctions of $400.00 per motion. (Opp., Greer Decl., ¶5.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiffs 2515 Thurman, LLC and Brian Haydel’s (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and for
Monetary Sanctions; and (2) Motion Deeming Requests for Admission, Set One,
Admitted and for Monetary Sanctions are DENIED. PLAINTIFFS AND COUNSEL
OF RECORD ARE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $800.00 TO DEFENSE
COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
