And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motions to compel responses to form interrogatories and to deem requests for admission admitted, as well as their request for sanctions. The judge has also awarded reduced sanctions of $400.00 to the defendants for "unsuccessfully asserting that [defendants] engaged in the misuse of the discovery process." The plaintiffs and their counsel are jointly and severally ordered to pay the sanctions of $800.00 to the defense counsel within 20 days of service of the order.
