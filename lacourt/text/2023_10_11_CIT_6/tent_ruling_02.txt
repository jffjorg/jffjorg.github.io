 Case Number:  23PSCV01364    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2023    Dept:  6 LVNV Funding LLC v. Ji KimPlaintiff LVNV Funding LLC’s Request for Entry of Default JudgmentDefendant: Ji KimTENTATIVE RULING Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.BACKGROUND This is a collection case. Plaintiff LVNV Funding LLC (Plaintiff) is a debt collector. The originator of the underlying debt, Cross River Bank, sold the debt to Sherman Originator III, LLC, who sold the debt to Sherman Originator, LLC, who then sold the debt to Plaintiff. Plaintiff filed this action on May 5, 2023, alleging two causes of action for breach of contract and open book account against Defendant Ji Kim (Defendant) and Does 1 through 10. Plaintiff filed a default judgment package on July 10, 2023.LEGAL STANDARD Code of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.)ANALYSIS Plaintiff seeks default judgment against Defendant in the total amount of $42,030.53, including $30,105.85 in damages, $10,098.00 in interest, $1,293.18 in attorney fees, and $533.50 in costs. However, the Court notes some issues with respect to the request for entry of default judgment. First, the subject loan agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey. (Johnson Decl., Ex. B, ¶ 24.) Plaintiff’s requests for interest, attorney fees, and costs appear to be based on California law, as evidenced by the 10% interest calculation and calculation for attorney fees based on Local Rule 3.214. (Decl. re Accrued Interest and Attorney’s Fees, ¶¶ 3-4.) Second, even if California law were to apply, the Court notes that the subject loan agreement is in writing but contains no provision for attorney fees to the prevailing party. (See generally, Johnson Decl.) Under Civil Code section 1717.5, no attorney fees can be awarded in such a case. (Civ. Code § 1717.5, subd. (a), fourth paragraph.)CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
