PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES (filed 04/29/2024)
 
TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for
Attorneys’ Fees is GRANTED. The Court awards Plaintiff $83,197.50 in attorney fees and costs. 
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On July 27,
2022, Plaintiff Immigrant Rights Defense Council, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed this
action against Defendant Aurelio Ramirez.
 
On June 22,
2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint alleging a cause of
action for Violation of the Immigration Consultant Act (“ICA”). 
 
The FAC
alleges Defendant is in the business of acting as an immigration consultant. The
FAC further alleges that Defendant has engaged in multiple violations of the
ICA, including the unauthorized practice of law. Plaintiff seeks injunctive
relief and reasonable fees/costs. 
 
The parties
stipulated to a judgment of injunction. On February 27, 2024, the Court entered
judgment enjoining Defendant from violating the ICA as well as entitling
Plaintiff to reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. 
 
On March 4,
2024, Plaintiff filed and served its memorandum of costs. 
 
On April 29,
2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for attorneys’ fees, arguing:
·      
Plaintiff is entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees
and costs under Business and Professions Code section 22446.5
·      
Plaintiff’s counsel’s hours spent/hourly rate is reasonable
·      
This action serves the public interest. Plaintiff should be
awarded a lodestar multiplier of 1.5.
·      
Plaintiff requests attorney’s fees and costs for a total of $83,197.50.
 
On July 1,
2024 Defendant filed an opposition, arguing: 
·      
Plaintiff has not met the statutory requirements under private
attorney general fee statute codified in Code of Civil Procedure §1021.5 for an
award of attorney’s fees.
o   Plaintiff has
not established the following requirements: Enforcement of an Important Right
Affecting the Public Interest; Significant Benefit on the General Public; The necessity
and financial burden of private enforcement
·      
Plaintiff is an alter ego of the Medvei Law Goup
o   The Medvei
Law Group formed Immigrant Rights Defense Council, LLC, a California Limited
Liability Company which owned by IRDC Holdings, LLC in Delaware (also formed by
the Medvei Law Group) as its alter ego to file hundreds of lawsuits to generate
attorney’s fees and income for themselves. (Lakhman Decl. at p. 8, ¶17:21-23
& Exhibit “L”).
o   IRDC
Holdings, LLC or IRDC Holdings, Inc. is owned, operated and Controlled by The
Medvei Law Group
o   No
Attorney-Client Relationship Between Plaintiff Immigrant Rights Defense
Council, LLC and Sebastian Medvei of Medvei Law Group, APC
§  Plaintiff
Immigrant Rights Defense Council, LLC is owned by IRDC Holdings, Inc. and now
IRDC Holdings, LLC, a Delaware entity owns solely by Adrien Medvei, and
operates and controls by Sebastian Medvei of the Medvei Law Group, APC. As
such, there is no attorney-client relationship between Immigrant Rights Defense
Council, LLC and Sebastian Medvei of Medvei Law Group, APC
o   There is no
abuse of discretion for the trial court to deny private attorney general fees
based on Plaintiff’s personal and pecuniary motives to bring suit. Children
& Families Com. of Fresno County v. Brown (2014) 228 Cal. App. 4th 45.
o   The analysis
in Trope v. Katz (1995) 11 Cal. 4th 274, is applicable.
·      
The attorney’s fees sought are neither warranted nor reasonable
o   For example, Plaintiff’s
claims of 8 hours pre-filing investigation of defendant’s violations of the ICA
is unreasonable.
o   Mr. Medvei’s
declaration asserts 73.9 hours working on this case.
 
On July 11,
2024, Plaintiff filed a reply arguing:
·      
Plaintiff is entitled to its attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to
statute and stipulation
·      
Plaintiff is not an alter ego of its attorney. Defendant
misapplies the alter ego doctrine
o   The alter ego
doctrine is an equitable doctrine of liability that applies to owners of
fictitious entities. SEC v. Hickey (9th Cir. 2003) 322 F. 3d 1123,
1128-1129 amended 335 F. 3d 834.
o   Even if
Plaintiff’s counsel owned Plaintiff (he does not) and Defendant’s alter ego
theory (as to which Defendant carries the burden) had been substantiated by
actual evidence of alter ego (which it is not), the determination that
Plaintiff is Plaintiff’s counsel’s alter ego would be completely irrelevant to
what is at issue on this motion.
·      
Plaintiff is not a self-represented litigant 
o   Plaintiff’s
cause of action against the Defendant in this action is not tied to any
personal rights of the Plaintiff
o   The
Plaintiff’s claims, which are solely for injunctive relief and not for any
damages remedy, instead, belong to the state, and the Plaintiff is merely
deputized by the state to carry out the state’s interests in enforcing the
Immigration Consultants Act (ICA) against immigration consultants by obtaining
injunctive relief on “behalf of the general public. . . .” Bus. & Prof.
Code § 22446.5(b)
o   No personal
interest of the Plaintiff is being prosecuted in this action, rendering the
Trope doctrine completely inapplicable to the Plaintiff
o   Plaintiff is
wholly owned by its parent, IRDC Holdings, LLC. Plaintiff’s counsel and his law
firm, which itself is a professional corporation distinct from the Plaintiff,
have no ownership stake in the Plaintiff or its parent company whatsoever. (Decl.
of Medvei, ¶ 4.)
o   The law is
well-established that an organizations cannot be a pro se litigant unless it is
a law firm. See e.g. PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal. 4th
1084, 1093-1094 (explicitly holding that in-house counsel for a fictitious
entity can recover attorney’s fees and rejecting any application of Trope
to instances where a corporation is represented by counsel, in-house or
otherwise); see also id. at 1094 (“[A]n organization is not comparable
to a pro se litigant because the organization is always represented by counsel,
whether in-house or pro bono, and thus, there is always an attorney-client
relationship.”) (citing Kay v. Ehrler (1991) 499 U.S. 432, 436 fn. 7).
·      
An interest in recovering attorney’s fees as costs in litigation
is not a personal interest in the outcome of litigation that invokes the Trope
doctrine
·      
Defendant’s claim that some Defendants continue to violate the ICA
is irrelevant
·      
Defendant’s reliance on hearsay news articles is improper
·      
Plaintiff’s fee request is reasonable in amount
 
On September
12, 2024, Defendant filed an Amended Opposition. 
 
On September
19, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply and objection to the Amended Opposition asserting
Defendant did not seek leave to amend the opposition and the amended
opposition, when considered together with the original opposition, exceeds the
page limits provided for a memorandum in support of a brief. (CCP § 473(a)(1); CRC
Rule 3.1113(d).)

judicial departments of the United States and of any state of the United
States,” “[r]ecords of (1) any court of this state or (2) any court of record
of the United States or of any state of the United States,” and “[f]acts and

immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably
indisputable accuracy.” (Evid. Code § 452, subds. (c), (d), and (h).) The Court
may take judicial notice of its own file. (See Stepan v. Garcia (1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 497, 500.) “[A] precondition

D.     Legal
Standard 
 
CCP §§ 1032 and 1033.5 provide that a prevailing party may
recover its costs as a matter of right, and that those costs may include
attorneys’ fees when authorized by statute or contract. 
 
“[A]bsent
circumstances rendering the award unjust, an attorney fee award should
ordinarily include compensation for all the hours reasonably spent,
including those relating solely to the fee.  We explained that the purpose
behind statutory fee authorizations—i.e., encouraging attorneys to act as
private attorneys general and to vindicate important rights affecting the
public interest—will often be frustrated, sometimes nullified, if awards are
diluted or dissipated by lengthy, uncompensated proceedings to fix or defend a
rightful fee claim.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1133-34 (emphasis in original).)  “The fee setting inquiry in California
ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.... The lodestar figure may
then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in
order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services
provided.” (Id. at 1134.) Other factors to consider in fixing the
reasonableness of fees to be considered beyond the fee agreement alone include,
but are not limited to “(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the
legal service properly; (2) the likelihood that the acceptance of the
particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer; (3) the fee
customarily charged in this locality for similar legal services; (4) the amount
involved and the results obtained; (5) the time limitations imposed by the
circumstances; and (6) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or
lawyers performing the services.” (Glendora Community Redevelopment
Agency v. Demeter (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 465, 470.)
 
E.    
Plaintiff is entitled to recover
attorney’s fees
 
Business and Professions Code section 22446.5 “sets
forth three classes of plaintiffs who may pursue actions against immigration
consultants who violate the ICA: (1) ‘A person claiming to be aggrieved by a
violation of this chapter by an immigration consultant may bring a civil action
or injunctive relief or damages, or both’ (subd. (a)); ‘Any other party who,
upon information and belief, claims a violation of this chapter has been
committed by an immigration consultant may bring a civil action for injunctive
relief on behalf of the general public’ (subd. (b)); and (3) ‘The Attorney
General, a district attorney, or a city attorney who claims a violation of this
chapter has been committed by an immigration consultant, may bring a civil
action for injunctive relief, restitution, and other equitable relief against
the immigration consultant in the name of the people of the State of
California’ (subd. (c)).” (Immigrant Rights Defense Council, LLC v. Hudson
Ins. Co. (2022) 84 Cal. App. 5th 305, 309-310.) “The first two categories
of plaintiffs who prevail in their actions are entitled to ‘reasonable
attorneys’ fees and costs.’” (Id. at 310.) Indeed, such fees and costs
are mandatory, as opposed to other statutes that provide for discretionary
awards. (Bus. & Prof. Code § 22446.5(b) (stating that a private attorney
general plaintiff, “upon prevailing, shall recover reasonable attorneys’ fees
and costs”—use of the word shall makes such fees and costs mandatory); see
e.g. Grossman v. Park Fort Washington Assn. (2012) 212 Cal. App. 4th 1128,
1133 (where statutory conditions for an award of statutory attorney fees is
met, award is “mandatory”); Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal. 3d 621, 633.)
 
In
Defendant’s opposition, he argues that Plaintiff has not met the statutory requirements under private
attorney general fee statute codified in Code of Civil Procedure §1021.5 for an
award of attorney’s fees. However, Defendant’s argument is inapplicable as Plaintiff
is entitled to mandatory attorney’s fees pursuant to Business & Professions
Code section 22446.5(b). Further, the parties’ stipulation provides that
Plaintiff was awarded an injunction against Defendants and Plaintiff is
entitled to attorney’s fees and costs.
 
Defendant
also argues that Plaintiff is not entitled to attorneys fees because no
Attorney-Client relationship exists between Plaintiff Immigrant Rights Defense
Council, LLC and Plaintiff’s counsel, Sebastian Medvei of Medvei Law Group,
APC. Plaintiff contends that Mr. Medvei’s pecuniary interest in the outcome of the litigation
is interchangeable with and legally indistinct from Immigrant Rights Defense
Council, LLC, his alter ego.  However,
the Court does not find Plaintiff’s argument or authority in support,
persuasive or applicable here. Plaintiff argues that there is no abuse of
discretion for the trial court to deny private attorney general fees based on
Plaintiff’s personal and pecuniary motives to bring suit. (Children &
Families Com. of Fresno County v. Brown (2014) 228 Cal. App. 4th 45.)
However, as discussed above, this assertion is inapplicable as Plaintiff is not
claiming an award of attorney’s fees under private attorney general fee statute
codified in Code of Civil Procedure §1021.5. In addition, Defendant argues that
Plaintiff is self-represented, similar to Trope v. Katz (1995) 11 Cal.
4th 274. However, Trope involved a law firm which chose to represent
itself in an action in which it had sued a former client for breach of
contract. Even though the parties had entered an agreement allowing the court
to award reasonable attorney fees in event of litigation, the court found that
the law firm was not entitled to attorneys fees because they were representing
themselves. (Id. at 283.) Here, Plaintiff is not a law firm and Defendant
does not establish that Plaintiff is self-represented. (See PLCM Group, Inc.
v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal. 4th 1084, 1093-1094 (explicitly holding that
in-house counsel for a fictitious entity can recover attorney’s fees and
rejecting any application of Trope to instances where a corporation is
represented by counsel, in-house or otherwise); see also id. at 1094
(“[A]n organization is not comparable to a pro se litigant because the
organization is always represented by counsel, whether in-house or pro bono,
and thus, there is always an attorney-client relationship.”) (citing Kay v.
Ehrler (1991) 499 U.S. 432, 436 fn. 7).) 
 
Based on the
foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to its reasonable
attorneys’ fees and costs. 
 
F.     
Hourly Rate
 
“The
reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar
work.”  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “The
experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services
rendered in [her] court.” (Ibid.) An attorney’s
own billing rates carry a presumption of reasonableness. (Mandel v. Lackner
(1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 747, 761)
 
Plaintiff’s
counsel asserts his hourly rate of $750 is a reasonable base rate for the
lodestar calculation. Plaintiff’s counsel states this hourly rate is well
within the range of current market rates in Los Angeles for attorneys of
similar experience. (Medvei Decl., ¶ 6.)
 
The Court finds that the rate requested by Plaintiff’s
counsel is reasonable. Counsel’s
declaration sufficiently attests to his experience and the reasonableness of
the rates. (Medvei Decl., ¶¶ 5-7.) Based on the evidence before it, the Court is not inclined to
reduce the hourly rates requested.
 
G.   
Reasonable Hours Incurred and Costs
 
“A
trial court assessing attorney fees begins with a touchstone or lodestar
figure, based on the ‘careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable
hourly compensation of each attorney ... involved in the presentation of the
case.”  (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165
Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.) “The reasonableness of attorney fees is within the
discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a consideration of such
factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues, the
experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved. The court
may also consider whether the amount requested is based upon unnecessary or
duplicative work.” (Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443,
448.) 
 
While
not per se objectionable, block billing can exacerbate the vagueness of an
attorney fee request and support a court’s finding that time entries were
inflated and non-compensable.  (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor
(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1325-1326.) 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel states that he expended 73.9 hours litigating
this case. Plaintiff also seeks a lodestar enhancement of 1.5 due to: 1)
the contingent nature of Plaintiff’s counsel’s compensation and likely delays
in receiving payment; and 2) the public interest nature of the litigation. 
 
The
Court has reviewed all of the claimed hours. Utilizing a lodestar method, the Court
finds that the total amount of reasonable hours spent by Plaintiff’s counsel in
this matter to date is 73.9 hours. Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s 8 hours
claimed for pre-filing investigation, 1 hour spent preparing the Complaint, 1
hour spent propounding discovery and 2 hours spent reviewing discovery
responses are unreasonable. However, Plaintiff does not put forth sufficient evidence
that the claimed hours are unreasonable. Therefore, the lodestar attorney’s
fees award is $55,425 (73.9 x $750/hr.). Plaintiff’s request for a lodestar enhancement/multiplier
of 1.5 is granted. Thus, the Court awards
Plaintiff’s requested attorneys fees in the sum of $83,137.50
plus $60 in the filing of the instant Motion. 
 
In sum, this Court grants Plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees and costs totaling
$83,197.50.
 
III.
DISPOSITION 
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for
Attorneys’ Fees is GRANTED. The Court awards Plaintiff $83,197.50 in attorney fees and costs.
