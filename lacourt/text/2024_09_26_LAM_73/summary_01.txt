**Significant Statements:**
  - "The discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination."
  - "Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery."
  - "Continuing misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse."
