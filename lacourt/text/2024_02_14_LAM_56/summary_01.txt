```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers in this case, which arises out of a dispute concerning Plaintiffs' investment property. The Court has also considered the requests for judicial notice and the evidentiary objections.

The Court finds that the Motion for Summary Judgment/Adjudication does not meet its evidentiary burden to demonstrate that the delayed discovery rule does not apply. The Court therefore DENIES the Motion.

The Court notes that the Moving Defendant has failed to argue that it was not Plaintiffs' fiduciary as alleged in the complaint, and the Motion fails to address the standard for triggering Plaintiffs' duty to exercise diligence in light of a fiduciary relationship.

The Court orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling, and directs parties who intend to submit on this tentative to send an email to the Court as directed by the instructions provided on the court website.
