AND RELATED
CROSS-ACTIONS
 
MOVING
PARTY: Defendant Centaurus Financial, Inc. (“Moving Defendant”)
 
RESPONDING
PARTY: Plaintiffs
 
The
Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
This
action, which arises out of a dispute concerning Plaintiffs’ investment
property (the “Property”), was initiated on September 7, 2021.  The currently operative second amended
complaint (the “SAC”) alleges: (1) breach of fiduciary duty; (2) California
financial elder abuse; (3) Illinois financial elder abuse; (4) breach of
contract; (5) breach of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing; (6) aiding
and abetting breach of fiduciary duty; (7) negligence; (8) violation of
Business & Professions Code sections 17200 and 17500; (9) common law fraud;
and (10) negligent misrepresentation.  
 
In
relevant part, the SAC alleges: Plaintiffs purchased fractional interests in
the Property through a Delaware Statutory Trust (the “Spring Gate DST”).  (SAC ¶ 3.) 
Moving Defendant acted as the broker-dealer that solicited, recommended
and sold Plaintiffs their interests in the Spring Gate DST.  (SAC ¶ 8.) 
The Private Placement Memorandum (the “PPM”) for the Spring Gate DST was
prepared and circulated on or about July 29, 2013, and Plaintiffs made their
investments between approximately August 2013 and January 2014.  (SAC ¶¶ 51-52.)  The PPM included questionable terms, which
Moving Defendant should have recognized as red flags that prevented it from
recommending the Spring Gate DST to Plaintiffs. 
(SAC ¶ 60.)  
 
During the due diligence process, Moving Defendant
knew or should have known that Defendant Anthony Thompson (“Thompson”) had a
legal history involving various investor lawsuits.  (SAC ¶ 64.)  The PPM did not fully disclose Thompson’s
impairments.  (SAC ¶ 60.) On or about July 30, 2013, the Department of Enforcement for the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) filed a complaint against
Thompson and his broker/dealer alleging that they had defrauded investors (the
“FINRA Action”).  (SAC ¶ 66.)  Supplement No. 1 to the PPM disclosed
information about the FINRA Action that included a description that was
designed to downplay and misrepresent the proceeding.  (See
SAC ¶¶ 67-72.) 
When FINRA issued its decision against Thompson in 2015, no additional
supplement was issued to Plaintiffs, even though Thompson and his entities
continued to manage the Spring Gate DST and the Property.  (SAC ¶ 73-75.)  The offering materials for the Spring Gate
DST also omitted relevant information about another FINRA action in addition to
a class action lawsuit.  (See SAC ¶¶ 80-84.)
 
On
December 1, 2023, Moving Defendant filed a motion for summary
judgment/adjudication (the “Motion”) on the grounds that the undisputed
material facts demonstrate that Plaintiffs’ claims against Moving Defendant are
barred by the applicable statute of limitations.
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL
NOTICE
The
Requests for Judicial Notice filed by Moving Defendant and Plaintiffs are
GRANTED as to the existence of the documents and their legal effect, but not to
the truth of the matters stated therein. 
(See Scott v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th
743, 752-54.)
 
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
Plaintiffs’
objections to the Declaration of Bryan Gless (“Gless Decl.”) are
SUSTAINED.  
 
Moving
Defendant’s evidentiary objections are OVERRULED. 
 
DISCUSSION
The
function of a motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a
determination as to whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support
for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the
need for trial.  (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  California Code of Civil Procedure
(“CCP”) section 437c, subdivision (c) requires the trial judge to grant summary
judgment if all the evidence submitted, and all inferences reasonably deducible
from the evidence and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that
there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 
(Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp.
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)
 
As
to each claim as framed by the complaint, the defendant moving for summary
judgment must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to negate
an essential element, or to establish a defense.  (CCP § 437c, subd. (p)(2); Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.)  Once the
defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that
a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action
or a defense thereto.  To establish a triable
issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence.  (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)  Courts liberally
construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and
resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.  (Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
 
Delayed Discovery Rule
The
discovery rule provides that the accrual date of a cause of action is delayed
until the plaintiff is aware of her injury and its negligent cause.   (Jolly v. Eli Lilly & Co. (1988)
44 Cal.3d 1103, 1109.)  A plaintiff is
held to her actual knowledge as well as knowledge that could reasonably be
discovered through investigation of sources open to her.  (Id.) 
When a plaintiff reasonably should have discovered facts for purposes of
the accrual of a case of action or application of the delayed discovery rule is
generally a question of fact, properly decided as a matter of law only if the
evidence (or, in this case, the allegations in the complaint and facts properly
subject to judicial notice) can support only one reasonable conclusion.  (Broberg v. The Guardian Life Ins. Co. of
America (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 912, 922.)


Moving
Defendant argues that Plaintiffs’ claims are barred by the applicable statutes
of limitations.  Moving Defendant further
argues that the delayed discovery rule cannot be invoked because Plaintiffs
were sophisticated investors who were on inquiry notice of issues with Thompson
and the Spring Gate DST and therefore had a duty to investigate.
 
The
Court finds that the Motion does not meet its evidentiary burden to demonstrate
that the delayed discovery rule does not apply. 
The undisputed material facts (“UMFs”) cited in the Separate Statement
broadly cite to documentary evidence without identifying particular pages of
the evidence or identifying how the evidence proves the purportedly undisputed
fact.  (See, e.g., UMFs 37-40; Artiglio
v. General Electric Co. (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 830, 842.)  Furthermore, the Motion does not argue that
Moving Defendant was not Plaintiffs’ fiduciary as alleged in the SAC, and the
Motion fails to address the standard for triggering Plaintiffs’ duty to
exercise diligence in light of a fiduciary relationship.  (See Hobbs v. Bateman Eichler, Hills
Richards, Inc. (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 174, 201-02.)  The Court therefore DENIES the Motion. 
 
            Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
