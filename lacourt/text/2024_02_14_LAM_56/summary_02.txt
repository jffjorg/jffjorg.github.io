And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered a petition to approve a minor's compromise in a case involving a landlord-tenant dispute. The petition seeks approval to settle the claims against the defendants for $70,000, with $30,000 going to each of the parental plaintiffs and $5,000 each to the minor plaintiff and another plaintiff. The petition also requests approval to deduct $1,250 from the minor plaintiff's recovery to pay attorney's fees and $180.25 to pay for costs. The court finds that the settlement agreement is fair and reasonable, and the requested amount of attorney's fees is also fair and reasonable. The court provisionally grants the petition, subject to the petitioner appearing at the hearing.
