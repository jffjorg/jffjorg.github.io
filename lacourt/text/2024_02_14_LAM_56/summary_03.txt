Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motions to quash service of summons (MTQ) and to compel discovery (MTC) filed by the Moving Defendant, Cosentino Group, S.A. The MTQ argues that the service of process on the Moving Defendant was improper because it was attempted in Canada, where the Moving Defendant is not located, and did not comply with the Hague Service Convention. The MTC requests that the Court order the Moving Defendant to provide responses to discovery requests that seek information that could lead to the production of evidence to establish jurisdictional facts.

The Court has ruled in favor of the Moving Defendant, granting the MTQ and denying the MTC. The Court found that the service of process was improper because it did not comply with the statutory procedures and the Hague Service Convention. The Court also found that the Moving Defendant did not have jurisdiction over the Moving Defendant, as the Moving Defendant is a Spanish corporation and was not properly served.

The Court has ordered the Moving Party to give notice of this ruling. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court as directed by the instructions provided on the court website.
