MOVING
PARTY:  Plaintiff Karla Maritza Gomez
Baiza (“Petitioner”)
 
The
Court has considered the moving papers. 
No opposition papers were filed. 
Any opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at
least nine court days before the hearing under California Code of Civil
Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises out of a landlord/tenant
relationship.  Plaintiffs’ complaint (the
“Complaint”) alleges: (1) breach of warranty of habitability; (2) breach of
covenant of quiet enjoyment; (3) negligence; and (4) breach of contract.  
 
 
On
January 17, 2024, Petitioner, as the guardian ad litem for minor Plaintiff
Melanie Alexandra Luis (“Claimant”), filed a petition to approve compromise of
disputed claim (the “Petition”).   
 
DISCUSSION
If
an action is pending and settlement is effected prior to trial, the minor’s
compromise must be approved by the court. 
(CCP § 372.)  A petition to
approve a minor’s compromise is governed by California Rules of Court (“CRC”), rules 7.950, et seq. and Probate Code sections 3500 and 3600 et seq.  The
trial court is authorized to approve and allow payment of reasonable expenses,
costs, and attorney fees in an action concerning the compromise of a minor’s
claim.  (Prob. Code § 3601, subd. (a); Curtis v. Estate of Fagan (2000) 82
Cal.App.4th 270, 277-79; see also CCP § 373.5.)
 
            Plaintiffs have agreed to settle their claims against Defendants for the
total amount of $70,000.  The terms of
the settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) allocate $30,000 to each
of the parental Plaintiffs and $5,000 each to Claimant and Plaintiff Jeysson
Luis Gomez.  The Petition requests
approval to deduct $1,250 from Claimant’s $5,000 total recovery to pay
attorney’s fees and $180.25 to pay for costs. 
The Petition also requests that Claimant’s proceeds be sent to
Claimant’s parents as provided in Attachment 18b(5).
 
Attorney’s
Fees
Unless
the court has approved the fee agreement in advance, the court must use a
reasonable fee standard when approving and allowing the amount of attorney's
fees payable from money or property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a
minor or a person with a disability. 
(CRC, r. 7.955(a).)  The court
must give consideration to the terms of the agreement between the attorney and
minor’s representative and must evaluate the agreement based on the facts and
circumstances existing at the time the agreement was made.  (CRC, r. 7.955(a)(2).)  CRC, rule 7.955(b)(2) sets out nonexclusive
factors the court may consider in determining the reasonableness of attorney’s
fees in connection with a petition for minor’s compromise.  Under CRC, rule 7.955(c), the petition must
include a declaration by the attorney addressing the factors set forth in CRC,
rule 7.955(b)(2) that are applicable to the matter that is before the court.
 
Claimant’s
counsel declares that this representation was accepted on a contingency
basis.  (Declaration of Rachel Fishenfeld
(“Fishenfeld Decl.”) ¶ 11.)  The
requested deduction of attorney’s fees represents 25 percent of Claimant’s
recovery.  (Fishenfeld Decl.
¶ 4.)  Counsel declares that
Defendants only agreed to enter into a settlement agreement after counsel
conducted at least 25 hours of research into Plaintiffs’ claims.  (See Fishenfeld Decl. ¶ 9.)  
 
            The Court finds that the Settlement Agreement is fair and
reasonable and the requested amount of attorney’s fees is fair and
reasonable.  For these reasons and
because it is unopposed, the Court provisionally GRANTS the Petition conditioned
on Petitioner appearing (either remotely or in person) at the hearing.  (Sexton
v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
