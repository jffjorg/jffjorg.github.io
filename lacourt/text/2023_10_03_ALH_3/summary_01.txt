And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Crowfoot has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jane Doe v. SF Markets, LLC dba Sprouts Farmers Market and George Mares. The case involves claims of hostile work environment, quid pro quo sexual harassment, retaliation, gender discrimination, and failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) and Labor Code.

Sprouts has moved to compel arbitration of these claims, alleging that an arbitration agreement was signed by Plaintiff in 2012 as part of her employment application process. The agreement is undated, but Sprouts claims that it applies to claims for discrimination, harassment, or retaliation, including claims based on sex and gender.

Plaintiff has opposed the motion, arguing that she does not recall signing the agreement and that the signature on the agreement does not resemble her own signature. However, the Court has found that Sprouts has met its initial burden to allege the existence of an arbitration agreement, and that the signature on the agreement is authentic despite Plaintiff's assertion that she does not recognize it.

The Court has granted Sprouts' motion to compel arbitration, staying the action until the completion of arbitration. The Court has also set a status conference to discuss the arbitration proceeding.
