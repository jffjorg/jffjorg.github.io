Sprouts has moved to compel arbitration of these claims, alleging that an arbitration agreement was signed by Plaintiff in 2012 as part of her employment application process. The agreement is undated, but Sprouts claims that it applies to claims for discrimination, harassment, or retaliation, including claims based on sex and gender.

Plaintiff has opposed the motion, arguing that she does not recall signing the agreement and that the signature on the agreement does not resemble her own signature. However, the Court has found that Sprouts has met its initial burden to allege the existence of an arbitration agreement, and that the signature on the agreement is authentic despite Plaintiff's assertion that she does not recognize it.

The Court has granted Sprouts' motion to compel arbitration, staying the action until the completion of arbitration. The Court has also set a status conference to discuss the arbitration proceeding.

## English Summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge William A. Crowfoot regarding a motion to compel arbitration filed by defendant Sprouts Farmers Market (“Sprouts”).  

Plaintiff Jane Doe sued Sprouts and George Mares alleging violations of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) and Labor Code. Sprouts claims that an existing arbitration agreement requires Plaintiff to resolve her claims through arbitration, not in court.

The judge found that Sprouts presented enough evidence to suggest the existence of an arbitration agreement signed by Plaintiff. Although Plaintiff denied signing the agreement and stated she didn't recognize her signature, the Judge was not persuaded. The Court found documents from Plaintiff's personnel file bearing her signature to be convincing evidence supporting the authenticity of the signature on the arbitration agreement.

As a result, the Judge granted Sprouts' motion to compel arbitration, staying the lawsuit until the arbitration process is complete.
