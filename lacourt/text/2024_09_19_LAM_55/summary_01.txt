And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on Assured Lender Services, Inc.'s (ALS) demurrer and motion to strike. ALS's demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, meaning that ALS's argument that the complaint does not state a cause of action is accepted. The Motion to Strike is denied as moot, meaning that it is no longer necessary to consider because ALS's demurrer has been sustained.

The judge's reasoning is based on the fact that ALS is a substituted trustee under the deed of trust and has filed a declaration of nonmonetary interest, which the plaintiffs did not object to. As a result, ALS is entitled to the protection of Civil Code Section 2924l, which limits the required participation of trustees, including substituted trustees. The judge also finds that the plaintiffs' objection to ALS's declaration was deficient and did not provide a factual basis for the objection.

Additionally, the judge finds that the plaintiffs' claims are barred by collateral estoppel, which is a doctrine that prevents the relitigation of issues that have already been decided in a prior proceeding. In this case, the judge's prior order granting summary judgment to Defendant Block and Emrek is a final adjudication that is binding on the parties. Therefore, the plaintiffs are precluded from relitigating those issues against ALS.
