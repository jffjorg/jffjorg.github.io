Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motions to compel further responses to deposition questions and to quash a deposition subpoena. The plaintiff, D.E., alleges that the defendant, the Regents of the University of California, discriminated against her based on her disabilities and failed to provide reasonable accommodations. The Regents seek to compel answers to deposition questions regarding D.E.'s anxiety and mental/emotional distress. The court finds that D.E.'s allegations of emotional distress and intentional infliction of emotional distress place her mental condition at issue and waive her privilege under Cal. Evid. Code ยง1014. The court grants the Regents' motion to compel further responses to deposition questions.

The court also considers the Regents' motion to quash a deposition subpoena seeking information related to the impact of the University's policies on other students. The court finds that while disparate impact is not pleaded in the complaint, evidence of disparate impact may be probative of intentional discrimination. The court denies the Regents' motion to quash the deposition subpoena, allowing D.E. to seek evidence related to the impact of the University's policies on other disabled students, but only to the extent that it may support her claim of disparate treatment.
