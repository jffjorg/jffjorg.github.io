Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motions to compel further responses to deposition questions and to quash a deposition subpoena. The plaintiff, D.E., alleges that the defendant, the Regents of the University of California, discriminated against her based on her disabilities and failed to provide reasonable accommodations. The Regents seek to compel answers to deposition questions regarding D.E.'s anxiety and mental/emotional distress. The court finds that D.E.'s allegations of emotional distress and intentional infliction of emotional distress place her mental condition at issue and waive her privilege under Cal. Evid. Code §1014. The court grants the Regents' motion to compel further responses to deposition questions.

The court also considers the Regents' motion to quash a deposition subpoena seeking information related to the impact of the University's policies on other students. The court finds that while disparate impact is not pleaded in the complaint, evidence of disparate impact may be probative of intentional discrimination. The court denies the Regents' motion to quash the deposition subpoena, allowing D.E. to seek evidence related to the impact of the University's policies on other disabled students, but only to the extent that it may support her claim of disparate treatment.

## English Summary:

The judge is considering two motions from the Regents of the University of California regarding a case brought by D.E., a UCLA graduate student.  

The first motion seeks to compel D.E. to answer deposition questions about a physician she saw for anxiety and mental/emotional distress. The judge finds that because D.E. is seeking damages for emotional distress, she has waived her right to keep these communications confidential under the psychotherapist-patient privilege. 

The second motion asks to quash a PMQ deposition subpoena seeking information about how the University's policies affect other disabled students. While D.E. hasn't explicitly alleged a disparate impact claim in her lawsuit, the judge recognizes that evidence of disparate impact can be relevant to her claim of intentional discrimination. Therefore, the judge denies the motion to quash, allowing D.E. to seek this evidence, but clarifies that it can only be used to support her existing claim of disparate treatment, not to create a new claim for disparate impact.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the Regents of the University of California to compel further responses to deposition questions and to quash a deposition subpoena. The plaintiff, D.E., a UCLA graduate student, alleges that the defendant discriminated against her based on her disabilities, including ADHD and migraines, by failing to provide reasonable accommodations. The defendant alleges that during her deposition, D.E. refused to identify the physician she saw for anxiety and other symptoms caused by the defendant's discrimination and refused to answer questions about whether she had treatment for these symptoms before attending UCLA.

The judge rules that the defendant's motion to compel further responses to deposition questions is granted, as D.E. has put her mental condition at issue by seeking damages for "emotional distress" and "humiliation." The judge also rules that the defendant's motion to quash the deposition subpoena is denied, as D.E. may seek evidence related to the impact of the defendant's policies on other disabled students, which could bolster her claim that she was also injured by the same policies. However, the judge notes that such evidence will only be admissible to the extent it may support D.E.'s claim of disparate treatment, not to support an unpleaded claim of disparate impact.

English summary:
The tentative ruling addresses two motions in the case of D.E. v. Regents of the University of California. The first motion involves the Regents’ request to compel D.E. to answer deposition questions regarding her physician and treatment history for anxiety and other symptoms caused by the Regents’ discrimination. The court grants this motion, stating that D.E. has put her mental condition at issue by explicitly seeking damages for mental and emotional harm in her complaint.

The second motion addresses the Regents’ request to quash 43 categories of requests from D.E.'s PMQ notice, which they argue are only relevant to a hypothetical disparate impact claim. The court denies the motion, stating that D.E. may seek evidence related to disparate impact, but it will only be admissible to support her disparate treatment claim. The court also clarifies that disparate treatment and disparate impact claims are different theories of liability and must be specifically alleged.
