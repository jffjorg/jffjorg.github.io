And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Behrouz Shafie's unopposed motion to be relieved as counsel for the cross-complainants, Adel Ahadi, Tahmineh Davoodi Askar, and Tadi Protections, Inc. The motion was properly served and included the required judicial council forms. The supporting declaration states that there has been a complete breakdown of communication between Shafie and his clients, but ethics rules prohibit further details. As no opposition has been filed by the clients, the Judge finds that they are unlikely to suffer meaningful prejudice if the motion is granted.
