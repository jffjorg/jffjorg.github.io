Mahmood Amin v.
Adel Ahadi, Case No. 21SMCV00348
Hearing Date
September 20, 2023
Behrouz Shafie,
Esq.’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel (UNOPPOSED) 
 
Attorney Shafie
moves to be relieved as counsel for cross-complainants Adel Ahadi, Tahmineh
Davoodi Askar and Tadi Protections, Inc. The motions were properly served and
included the judicial council forms required. The supporting declaration states
there has been a “complete breakdown of communication between the attorney and
client,” but “ethics rules prohibit any additional detail in a public
document.” Since there are no additional substantive hearings scheduled,
cross-complainants are unlikely to suffer meaningful prejudice if the motion is
granted. No opposition has been filed by the clients. GRANTED.
