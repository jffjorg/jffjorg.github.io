```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the complaint and the motion to remove mechanic's lien. Groundtech Inc. (plaintiff) performed shoring and concrete subcontracting work at Puryear's property, but Puryear and general contractor RDG failed to pay for the services. Puryear demurred to the complaint and moved to remove Groundtech's mechanic's lien.

The judge sustained the demurrer to the breach of contract claim, finding that the complaint does not adequately allege a contract claim against Puryear. However, the judge overruled the demurrer to the quantum meruit cause of action, finding that the complaint specifically alleges the elements of quantum meruit and that Puryear's "double payment" argument is a factual claim, not a proper basis for demurrer.

The judge also overruled the demurrer to the account stated/open book account claims, finding that they are based on the same allegations as the quantum meruit cause of action.

Regarding the motion to remove mechanic's lien, the judge found that Groundtech's mechanic's lien is invalid due to lack of notice. Groundtech never provided a 20-day preliminary notice, and the untimely notice precludes Groundtech from recording a lien based on work performed more than 20 days before service.

The judge granted Groundtech leave to amend its breach of contract cause of action and stayed its determination of whether the California Civil Code §8200 exception applies until after Groundtech files a first amended complaint. The motion to remove mechanic's lien is continued pending the filing of Groundtech's first amended complaint.

## English Summary:

Judge’s Tentative Ruling:

The judge ruled that Groundtech Inc. did not adequately state a claim for breach of contract against Puryear, but gave them ten days to amend the complaint.  

The judge also found that Groundtech did state a claim for quantum meruit (payment for services rendered) and for an account stated/open book account.

However, the judge ruled that Groundtech's mechanic's lien is invalid because they failed to file a preliminary notice within the required 20-day timeframe.

The judge stayed their decision on whether Groundtech might qualify for an exception to the preliminary notice requirement until after Groundtech amends their complaint.
