```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the complaint and the motion to remove mechanic's lien. Groundtech Inc. (plaintiff) performed shoring and concrete subcontracting work at Puryear's property, but Puryear and general contractor RDG failed to pay for the services. Puryear demurred to the complaint and moved to remove Groundtech's mechanic's lien.

The judge sustained the demurrer to the breach of contract claim, finding that the complaint does not adequately allege a contract claim against Puryear. However, the judge overruled the demurrer to the quantum meruit cause of action, finding that the complaint specifically alleges the elements of quantum meruit and that Puryear's "double payment" argument is a factual claim, not a proper basis for demurrer.

The judge also overruled the demurrer to the account stated/open book account claims, finding that they are based on the same allegations as the quantum meruit cause of action.

Regarding the motion to remove mechanic's lien, the judge found that Groundtech's mechanic's lien is invalid due to lack of notice. Groundtech never provided a 20-day preliminary notice, and the untimely notice precludes Groundtech from recording a lien based on work performed more than 20 days before service.

The judge granted Groundtech leave to amend its breach of contract cause of action and stayed its determination of whether the California Civil Code §8200 exception applies until after Groundtech files a first amended complaint. The motion to remove mechanic's lien is continued pending the filing of Groundtech's first amended complaint.

## English Summary:

Judge’s Tentative Ruling:

The judge ruled that Groundtech Inc. did not adequately state a claim for breach of contract against Puryear, but gave them ten days to amend the complaint.  

The judge also found that Groundtech did state a claim for quantum meruit (payment for services rendered) and for an account stated/open book account.

However, the judge ruled that Groundtech's mechanic's lien is invalid because they failed to file a preliminary notice within the required 20-day timeframe.

The judge stayed their decision on whether Groundtech might qualify for an exception to the preliminary notice requirement until after Groundtech amends their complaint.

##  English Summary:

The judge is considering Groundtech's lawsuit against Puryear for unpaid work. 

Groundtech claims Puryear promised to pay for their subcontracting services, but he didn't. Puryear disputes this and argues he shouldn't be liable because he only contracted with the general contractor, RDG.

The judge has ruled that Groundtech needs to revise its original lawsuit to better explain how Puryear is directly responsible for the unpaid work.

However, the judge has rejected Puryear's attempt to dismiss Groundtech's claim for "quantum meruit," which allows someone to recover payment for services even without a formal contract.

The judge has also denied Puryear's motion to remove a mechanic's lien placed on his property by Groundtech.  They've given Groundtech a chance to amend their lawsuit and argue that they are directly entitled to payment from Puryear, bypassing the usual requirement to file a preliminary notice.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by Puryear and the motion to remove mechanic's lien. The breach of contract claim against Puryear is sustained with ten days leave to amend, as the complaint fails to adequately allege a contract claim against Puryear. The quantum meruit claim against Puryear is overruled, as the complaint specifically alleges the elements of quantum meruit and Puryear's "double payment" argument is a factual claim, not a proper basis for demurrer. The account stated/open book account claims are overruled, as they are based on the same allegations as the quantum meruit claim.

Regarding the mechanic's lien, the court finds that the preliminary notice was filed late, and the lien is invalid for lack of notice. However, the court will stay its determination of whether the direct contractual relationship exception applies until after Groundtech files a first amended complaint. The motion to remove mechanic's lien is continued pending the filing of Puryear's first amended complaint.
