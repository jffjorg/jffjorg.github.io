And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Mardirossian v. Howarth, case number 20SMCV01557. The case involves a dispute between Mardirossian and Howarth over leaves and debris falling from Howarth's trees, which Mardirossian claims constitute a fire hazard and a nuisance. Howarth has cross-complained, alleging that Mardirossian's tennis court construction violates their properties' 10-foot setback requirement and constitutes a noise nuisance and trespass.

Mardirossian has moved to quash deposition subpoenas served on Rich Festa, a State Farm employee, and Avo Harutunian, a Farmers Insurance employee, seeking documents and communications related to fire insurance for Mardirossian's properties. The Judge has granted the motion to quash the subpoenas, finding that the requests are not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

However, the Judge has allowed some of the requests to proceed, finding that they seek information relevant to the remaining claims in the action. The Judge has also ordered Mardirossian's law firm, MA, to comply with requests 1, 2, and 5, which seek information relevant to the claims.
