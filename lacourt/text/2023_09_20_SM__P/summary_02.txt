The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Mardirossian v. Howarth, case number 20SMCV01557. The case involves a dispute between Mardirossian and Howarth over leaves and debris falling from Howarth's trees, which Mardirossian claims constitute a fire hazard and a nuisance. Howarth has cross-complained, alleging that Mardirossian's tennis court construction violates their properties' 10-foot setback requirement and constitutes a noise nuisance and trespass.

Mardirossian has moved to quash deposition subpoenas served on Rich Festa, a State Farm employee, and Avo Harutunian, a Farmers Insurance employee, seeking documents and communications related to fire insurance for Mardirossian's properties. The Judge has granted the motion to quash the subpoenas, finding that the requests are not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

However, the Judge has allowed some of the requests to proceed, finding that they seek information relevant to the remaining claims in the action. The Judge has also ordered Mardirossian's law firm, MA, to comply with requests 1, 2, and 5, which seek information relevant to the claims.

* Documents related to prior litigation between Mardirossian and the previous owner of his property.
* Communications between MA and third parties.

The judge narrowed the scope of a subpoena seeking records related to due diligence performed before Mardirossian purchased his property, requiring production of non-privileged documents relevant to the alleged improper construction. 

The judge found no bad faith in either the document requests or the motions to quash and did not award sanctions.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Mardirossian's motion to quash deposition subpoenas for business records from his law firm, Mardirossian Akagarian (MA). The subpoenas were served on Rich Festa and Avo Harutunian, employees of State Farm and Farmers Insurance, respectively, seeking documents and communications related to fire insurance for Mardirossian's properties.

The judge granted the motion to quash the subpoenas for requests 3-9, which seek communications between MA and third parties, as well as requests 6-9, which seek fire insurance information. The judge found that these requests are not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and are therefore irrelevant to the case.

The judge denied the motion to quash request 4, which seeks documents related to due diligence performed prior to the purchase of the Mardirossian property, finding that this request is relevant to the remaining claims in the action. The judge also denied the motion to quash requests 1, 2, and 5, which seek information relevant to the remaining claims.

The judge noted that the request for production of documents related to the prior litigation must be narrowed to require production of non-privileged documents relevant to the question of whether improper construction existed at the property when Mardirossian acquired it. No sanctions will be awarded, as there is no evidence that either the document requests or the motions to quash were made in bad faith.
