BACKGROUND
This case stems from an automobile
collision that occurred on March 6, 2023 when Hector Rafael Mejia Garcia and
Eduardo Alberto Ramirez (Plaintiffs) were hit by John Doe and Does 1-50.
(Complaint, ¶ GN-1.) Plaintiffs filed a Complaint on March 2, 2023. 
On March 8, 2024, the Court granted
Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Hector Rafael Mejia
Garcia (6202). (Minute Order 3/8/24.) 
The Motion now before the Court is
Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel for Eduardo Alberto
Ramirez (8211).  
Trial is not yet set. 
 
  LEGAL STANDARD 
An application to be relieved as counsel
must be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion)
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)). The proposed order must specify all hearing dates scheduled in the
action or proceeding, including the date of trial, if known. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(e).) Further, the requisite forms must be served on the
client and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(d).)
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff’s counsel has filed both forms
MC-051 and MC-052. Additionally, form MC-052 denotes all upcoming hearings,
including the Case Management Conference on March 12, 2024. Counsel files this
Motion under CCP § 284(2), noting that there has been an irremediable breakdown
in the attorney-client relationship. The declaration of counsel provides that
the client has been served by mail at the client’s last known address with
copies of the motion papers served with the declaration. Further, the
declaration provides that counsel has been unable to confirm that the address
is current or locate a more current address after (1) mailing the motion papers
to the client’s last known address, return receipt requested; (2) calling the
client’s last known telephone number or numbers; and (3) conducting a TLO
xp—people’s search. However, it does not appear that Plaintiff’s counsel has
filed Proof of Service.
Based on the foregoing, the court grants
Plaintiff’s counsel’s Motion to Be Relieved As Counsel subject to the filing
Proof of Service. 
The Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel for
Eduardo Alberto Ramirez (8211) filed by Daniel Azizi on 03/13/2024 is GRANTED
subject to the filing Proof of Service.
