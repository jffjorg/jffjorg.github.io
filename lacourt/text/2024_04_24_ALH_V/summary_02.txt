And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion for trial preference under Code of Civil Procedure section 36. The plaintiff, Haykgohi Zargarian, is over 70 years old and has a substantial interest in the action. However, the court found that the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that her health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. The court found that the declaration of the plaintiff's treating physician, Glenna Tolbert, was vague and did not provide sufficient information to support the plaintiff's claim. Therefore, the court denied the motion for trial preference.
