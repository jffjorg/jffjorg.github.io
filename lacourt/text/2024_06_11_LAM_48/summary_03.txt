The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant's actions were malicious and a violation of his civil rights. However, the Judge found that the Defendant has not been served with the summons and complaint, and therefore, the Petition is denied. The Judge also ordered the Plaintiff to serve the Defendant by June 17, 2024. A Case Management Conference is scheduled for the future.
