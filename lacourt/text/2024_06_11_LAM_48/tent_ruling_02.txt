[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR
  MALICIOUS PROSECUTION 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
June 11, 2024



 
On April 18, 2024, Plaintiff
Christopher Wade (in pro per) filed this action against Defendant Prime/Park La
Brea Titleholder.  The Complaint alleges
malicious prosecution, fraud, and civil rights violations arising from a prior
unlawful detainer action and a workplace violence restraining order.
On
May 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Petition for Malicious Prosecution.
Plaintiff
cites Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 as the basis for his
Petition.  (Petition at p. 4.)  Plaintiff contends that his “initial burden
is to show that the two causes of action in PLB’s actions against Wade arise
from protected activities.”  He then
argues that he will prevail on his malicious prosecution claim.
Code
of Civil Procedure section 425.16 governs anti-SLAPP motions.  “The anti-SLAPP procedures are designed to
shield a defendant’s constitutionally protected conduct from the undue burden
of frivolous litigation.”  (Baral v.
Schnitt (2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 393.)  In
an anti-SLAPP motion, it is the moving defendant’s burden to show that his own
conduct was in furtherance of his free speech. 
Then the plaintiff must demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the
claim, supported by sufficient evidence to make out a viable prima facie case.  (E.g., O&C Creditors Group, LLC v.
Stephens & Stephens XII, LLC (2019) 42 Cal.App.5th 546, 565-566.)  Section 425.16 provides no authority for a plaintiff
obtaining a premature judgment on the merits of the Complaint.
Additionally,
Defendant has not yet been served with the summons and complaint.  The summons issued on May 13, 2024—two weeks
after Plaintiff filed this Petition.  No
proof of service has been filed.  The
Court will not grant Plaintiff any relief (in this Petition or in future
motions) unless and until the opposing party has been served and has notice of
the requested relief.  Plaintiff should
serve Defendant by June 17, 2024.  (See
California Rules of Court, rule 3.110(b) [“The complaint must be served on all
named defendants and proofs of service on those defendants must be filed with
the court within 60 days after the filing of the complaint.”].)
The
Petition for Malicious Prosecution is DENIED.
A
Case Management Conference is scheduled for ____________.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit.  If all parties in the case submit on the
tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are required unless a
companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference) is also on
calendar.
