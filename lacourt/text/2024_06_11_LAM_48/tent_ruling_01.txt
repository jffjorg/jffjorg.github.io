  CASE NO.: 21STCV33923
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
June 11, 2024



 
Marshal
A. Oldman, counsel of record for Defendant Long Spring Freight LLC, seeks to be
relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration
states that Defendant’s representative has instructed him to refrain from any and
all work on this case.  No party opposed the
motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Trial is not until September 3, 2024, and there
is no prejudice to Defendant.  Additionally,
counsel declares that Defendant has been on notice of his intent to withdraw since
October 24, 2023.
The
unopposed motion to be relieved is GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 order and this order on Long Spring
Freight LLC and all parties who have appeared.
However,
“a corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona
or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  Therefore, an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure
to Retain New Counsel for Long Spring Freight LLC is scheduled for August 19, 2024
at 9:00 a.m. in Department 48 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
Long
Spring Freight LLC must retain new counsel by that date or the Court will strike
its answer and place it in default.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
