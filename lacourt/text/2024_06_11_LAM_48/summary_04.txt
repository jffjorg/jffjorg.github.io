And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to deny the plaintiff's petition for malicious prosecution. The plaintiff, Christopher Wade, filed the petition on May 10, 2024, alleging malicious prosecution, fraud, and civil rights violations arising from a prior unlawful detainer action and a workplace violence restraining order. The defendant, Prime/Park La Brea Titleholder, filed an anti-SLAPP motion, arguing that the plaintiff's claims are frivolous. The judge has denied the petition, citing Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, which governs anti-SLAPP motions. The judge has also ordered the plaintiff to serve the defendant with the summons and complaint by June 17, 2024.
