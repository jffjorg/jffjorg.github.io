(Judge's ruling denying the motion to disqualify)



**English Summary:**

The Judge denied the Plaintiffs' motion to disqualify ACLU's attorneys from the case. The Plaintiffs argued that ACLU breached the Co-Counseling Agreement and engaged in unethical conduct by continuing settlement discussions with the County after terminating the agreement. They also alleged a conflict of interest due to a former ACLU attorney seeking employment with the County.

The Judge found that Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that ACLU breached the agreement by terminating it according to its own terms. The Judge also found no evidence of a conflict of interest because ACLU waived any potential conflict arising from Bibring's employment pursuit and because the agreement did not create a client relationship between ACLU and Plaintiffs.

Summary:
The tentative ruling denies the motion to disqualify ACLU's counsel, citing a lack of evidence showing a breach of the co-counsel agreement or a conflict of interest. The Court finds that ACLU's termination of the co-counsel agreement was properly done under the terms of the agreement, and that Bibring's employment negotiations with the County did not create a conflict of interest. The Court also finds that Plaintiffs lack standing to challenge ACLU's counsel, as they have not alleged a cognizable injury or a breach of duty to the Deputy Plaintiffs.

  - name: Plaintiffs’ motion to disqualify is DENIED in its entirety

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to disqualify the ACLU attorneys in case number 19STCV33158. The Judge based their decision on the legal standard that a party may move to recuse counsel for the opposing party on grounds recognized by law, including mandatory disqualification for conflict of interest. The Judge found that the Plaintiffs did not establish a cognizable injury or a basis providing for disqualification under their cited section, and that the ACLU did not breach any section of the agreement to support disqualification on the alleged grounds. The ACLU had explicitly waived any potential conflict of interest due to Mr. Bibring's past representation of the ACLU before he applied for the position with the Office of Inspector General. The Plaintiffs have not identified any law that would allow this Court to remove ACLU from this matter as a result of participating in settlement discussions after they terminated the agreement or terminating the agreement under its own terms allowing ACLU to do so.

**Case Number:** 19STCV33158

**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023

**Plaintiffs:** Deputy Plaintiffs, Vincent Miller

**Defendants:** County of Los Angeles

**People:** Peter Bibring, Melanie Ochoa, Tiffany Bailey

**Company:** ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union)

**Events:** Plaintiffs' motion to disqualify ACLU counsel denied; ACLU counsel alleged to have engaged in misconduct and breached co-counseling agreement in representing ACLU while negotiating employment with Defendant County of Los Angeles; Plaintiffs argued ACLU hijacked settlement negotiations and breached agreement by pursuing reform settlement without their consent.

**Disputes:** Conflict of interest, disqualification of counsel, breach of co-counseling agreement, standing to challenge counsel's representation

**Acts:** Negotiations between ACLU counsel and Defendant County of Los Angeles for employment; pursuit of reform settlement by ACLU counsel without Plaintiffs' consent

**Agreements:** Co-counseling agreement between Plaintiffs and ACLU

**Laws:** California Rules of Professional Conduct, Business and Professions Code § 6068

**Case Citations:** M’Guinness v. Johnson (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 602, Lynn v. George (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 630, Mills Land & Water Co. v. Golden West Refining Co. (1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 116, Henriksen v. Great American Savings & Loan (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 109, Kennedy v. Eldridge (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 1197

**Roles:** Plaintiffs seeking disqualification of ACLU counsel; ACLU counsel defending against allegations of misconduct and breach of agreement

**Significant Statements:** "In exercising that discretion, the trial court is required to make a reasoned judgment which complies with the legal principles and policies applicable to the issue at hand." (Henriksen, supra, Cal.App.4th at p. 113)

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Plaintiffs' motion to disqualify ACLU counsel in its entirety. The Judge finds that Plaintiffs have not shown a cognizable injury or breach of contract that would provide a basis for disqualification. ACLU counsel terminated the co-counseling agreement upon realizing that their interests were not aligned with Plaintiffs, and there is no evidence of a conflict of interest or breach of agreement.
