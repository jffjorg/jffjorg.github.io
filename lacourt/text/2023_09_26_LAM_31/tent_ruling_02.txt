 Case Number:  21STCV33649    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2023    Dept:  31 Tentative: The Court has reviewed the request for
default judgment. The Court CONTINUED the matter to allow Plaintiff to file a
new default packet, correcting the following issues:
 
(1)  Plaintiff must file a corrected request for
Court judgment on CIV-100. The only request for Court judgment is dated 12/5/22
and the total requested states $27,23844.70. This should be corrected. Further
item 7 states Plaintiff seeks costs in the amount of $898, which is
inconsistent with the amount Plaintiff seeks in costs in item 2, i.e., $877.
Moreover, it is unclear why general damages exceed the amount sought
altogether. 
(2)  Photocopying fees are expressly not allowed
under CCP section 1033.5(b)(3).
(3)  Plaintiff must file a proposed judgment on
JUD-100.
(4)  The evidence does not support the full amount
sought in damages.
