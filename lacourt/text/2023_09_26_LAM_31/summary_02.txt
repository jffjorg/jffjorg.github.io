tentative: The Court has reviewed the request for default judgment and has decided to continue the matter to allow Plaintiff to file a new default packet, correcting the following issues:

* Plaintiff must file a corrected request for Court judgment on CIV-100. The only request for Court judgment is dated 12/5/22 and the total requested states $27,23844.70. This should be corrected. Further, item 7 states Plaintiff seeks costs in the amount of $898, which is inconsistent with the amount Plaintiff seeks in costs in item 2, i.e., $877. Moreover, it is unclear why general damages exceed the amount sought altogether.
