And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the Demurrer filed by the Defendants, Jay Zimmerman and Thomas Zimmerman, as co-trustees of The Zimmerman Trust of 1978, to the First Amended Complaint filed by the Plaintiffs, Automobile Driving Museum and Historic Automobile Preservation Entity. The Court finds that the First Amended Complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for breach of contract. The Court is tentatively inclined to sustain the demurrer without leave to amend, but will allow oral argument on whether the Plaintiffs' allegations about the oral discussions in paragraph 11 can be substantiated by written documents.
