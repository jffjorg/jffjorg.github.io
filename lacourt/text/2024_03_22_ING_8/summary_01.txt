The Court has reviewed the parties' submissions and is issuing a tentative ruling on the Motion to Compel Defendant's Compliance with the Court's September 13, 2023 Discovery Order. The Court finds that Defendant has failed to comply with the Court's order and has not provided sufficient explanations for the delays and shortcomings in its production of documents. The Court will continue the hearing to enable Defendant to provide a point-by-point response to Plaintiff's declaration, which highlights the deficiencies in Defendant's production. The Court expects more information on the issue of the failure to provide verifications and will not excuse the delay until a satisfactory explanation is provided. The Court will also consider prospective sanctions of $200 per day until Defendant complies with the Court's prior order.
