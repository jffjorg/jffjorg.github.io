And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a motor vehicle accident that occurred on March 1, 2022. The accident was allegedly caused by the defendant, Ian Anthony White, who was under the influence of alcohol or an unknown substance at the time of the accident. The plaintiffs, Andreea Popa and Robert Popa, are seeking to discover information about the defendant's blood alcohol test results and arrest records.

The defendant has filed a motion to quash the deposition subpoena, arguing that it is not relevant to the subject matter of the litigation and that it seeks private information in violation of the patent-physician privilege. The court disagrees, finding that the subpoena is relevant to the case and that the defendant's conduct is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

The court has also denied the defendant's request for monetary sanctions, finding that neither party has demonstrated a sufficient basis for such an award. The court has ordered the plaintiffs to give notice of the tentative ruling.

The court's ruling is based on California Vehicle Code, Code of Civil Procedure, and Civil Code, as well as the cases of Taylor v. Superior Court (1979) 24 Cal.3d 890 and Dawes v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 82.
