I. BACKGROUND¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
On October 19, 2022, Gail Chelebian
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against General Motors LLC (“GM”). On January
12, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleging causes of
action for: (1) Violation of Subdivision(D) of Civil Code section 1793.2; (2)
Violation of Subdivision(B) of Civil Code section 1793.2; (3) Violation of
Subdivision (A)(3) of Civil Code Section 1793.2; (4) Breach of the Implied
Warrant of Merchantability; ad (5) Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment. This
action is based on the fact that on or about December 29, 2017, Plaintiff
entered into a warranty contract regarding a 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV, VIN
1G1FX6S0XH4189565 (the “Subject Vehicle” or “Bolt”). (See FAC, ¶ 6.)
 
Per the moving papers, on January 27, 2023,
Plaintiff propounded Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, seeking
documents relating to GM’s internal investigation and analysis, among other
things, of what it refers to as the “Battery Defects.” Specifically, Plaintiff
notes she requested that Defendant produce documents concerning: (A) The
Subject Vehicle (i.e., RFP Nos. 1, 7); (B) GM’s Internal Knowledge and
Investigation regarding the Battery Defects in 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV Vehicles
(i.e., RFP Nos. 17, 23, 24, 25, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42); (C) Summaries,
Memoranda, and Power Points regarding the Battery Defects in 2017 Chevrolet
Bolt EV Vehicles (i.e., RFP Nos. 43, 44, 45); (D) Song Beverly Act and Buyback
Policies and Procedures (i.e., RFP No. 58, 59, 68); (E) Communication With
Governmental Agencies and Suppliers regarding the Battery Defects in 2017
Chevrolet Bolt EV Vehicles (i.e., RFP Nos. 76, 78, 79); (F) Dealer Agreements
and GM’s Financial Documents (i.e., RFP Nos. 85); and (G) Other Documents
Related To The Subject Vehicle’s Battery Defects (i.e., RFP Nos. 90, 91, 92,
93). 
 
However, Plaintiff claims that GM responded
insufficiently to the discovery requests by either: (1) completely refusing to
produce any documents for an many categories of the requests (i.e., RFP Nos.
17, 23, 24, 25, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 58, 59, 68, 76, 78, 79, 85,
90, 91, 92, 93) and (2) limiting the scope of discovery to include only the
Subject Vehicle (i.e., RFP Nos. 1, 7, 17, 23, 24, 25, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41,
42, 43, 44, 45, 58, 59, 68, 76, 78, 79, 90, 91, 92, and 93). As such, Plaintiff
filed its Motion to Compel. Prior to the last hearing on this motion, the
parties filed a joint statement noting that the remaining RFPs at issue were:
17, 23, 24, 25, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 76, 78, 79, and 90.
 
On September 13, 2023, this Court GRANTED
the Motion to Compel Further, in part, as to RFP Nos. 1, 7, 24-25, 42-45,
58-59, 68, 76, 78-79, and 90-93. This Court ordered compliance, verified
responses, and production of documents, by November 6, 2023. The September 13
Order detailed what documents GM was required to produce as to these remaining
categories.  Plaintiff asserts that GM
did not comply with the Court’s order, and that Plaintiff cannot readily determine
how to match the document production against the Request categories because GM
did not so specify in its ultimately verified written response either before or
after the November 6 deadline.
 
On November 6, 2023, GM served supplemental
responses to RFP Nos. 1, 7, 24-25, 42-45, 58-59, 68, 76, 78-79, and 90-93.
However, Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s document production remains
deficient, non-Code compliant, and contrary to the Court’s September 13, 2023.
As such, Plaintiff has brought this Motion to Compel Compliance with the
Court’s Order. 
 
B. Procedural¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
            On January 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed
this Motion to Compel Defendant’s Compliance with the Court’s September 13,
2023 Discovery Order. On February 26, 2024, Defendant filed this opposition. 
 
            This motion was originally heard on
March 8, 2024, which is when this Court continued the hearing to March 22,
2024, requiring defense counsel is to file a supplemental declaration
responding to the tentative ruling on or before March 20, 2024. On March 14,
2024, Plaintiff filed a Supplemental Declaration of Ebony Randolph in support
of the Motion to Compel Defendant’s Compliance with the Court’s September 13,
2023 Discovery Order. On March 20, 2024, Defendant filed the Declaration of
Sandra Habib in response to this Court’s tentative ruling. GM did not file a
response to Ms. Randolph’s declaration.
 
II. ANALYSIS¿¿ 
 
A.   
Legal Standard 
 
 A
party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) The party also waives the right to make any objections, including one
based on privilege or work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (a).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel responses to
interrogatories other than the cut-off on hearing discovery motions 15 days
before trial. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc.,
2030.290.) No meet and confer efforts are required before filing a motion to
compel responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411
 
B.   
Discussion 
 
In Defendant’s declaration of
Sandra Habib, with respect to the Court’s question 1, she states that her
office intended to serve the verifications timely, however, due to an “inadvertence”
in her office they were unable to serve the verifications on time. (Declaration
of Sandra Habib (“Habib Decl.”), ¶ 2.) No further information is provided as to
what the inadvertence was, whether it was Ms. Habib, her client contact, or
someone else who suffered from the inadvertence, etc.  In short, the Court finds this single
sentence vague explanation unsatisfactory. There was a 3-day gap between the
service of the November 6 written response and the service of the
verifications, but the Court still does not know what happened.  The Court expects more information on this issue
at the March 22 hearing or in a subsequent declaration.  So that GM appreciates the significance of the
issue, there has been a clear failure to comply with a Court-imposed deadline,
and judges take disobedience of an order very seriously.  A better explanation is required.
 
As to the second question raised in
the Court’s March 8 prior ruling for this March 22 hearing, Ms. Habib states that
with regard to why the Defendant’s responses do not use the phrase: “After
reasonable search and diligent inquiry,” her Declaration states that this Court
had already informed Ms. Ebony that the Code section did not require that a
party shall use the language except for when no documents were being produced.
However, she notes that GM’s position is that the language regarding reasonable
search and diligent inquire was not necessary since its responses were not
indicating a lack of responsiveness. Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.220 requires a
party responding to an RFP to indicate that when it agrees to “comply with the
particular demand [then the party] shall state that the production, inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, and related activity demanded, will
be allowed either in whole or in part.” 
There is no statutory requirement that a producing party who agrees to
comply must verify that it has done a search an inquiry; that requirement is
implicit.  It is only when a party is not
producing anything that the Discovery Act requires as follows: “A
representation of inability to comply with the particular demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling shall affirm that a diligent search and a
reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with that demand.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.230.)  Of course, the person who verifies the written
response can be deposed and questioned as to the completeness and comprehensiveness
of the production or of the claimed inability to comply with a RFP category.
 
As to the Court’s third question in
its March 8 ruling, Ms. Habib’s declaration states that GM produced the
following technical documents: Bulletins/Recalls applicable to the SUBJECT
VEHICLE (CHELEBIAN000000029 - CHELEBIAN000000036, CHELEBIAN000000073 -
CHELEBIAN000000152, and CHELEBIAN000009640 - CHELEBIAN000009743); and specific
TSBs (CHELEBIAN000009744 - CHELEBIAN000009775). Additionally, she states that a
“court representative” from GM has verified this response. 
 
As to question #4, RFPs Nos. 24 and
25, GM argues it has complied in whole and has produced documents in its
possession, custody, or control responsive to both requests. Specifically, as
to Request No. 24, GM argues that it has complied in whole and has produced
documents in its possession, custody, or control responsive to this request,
and refers Plaintiff to the following produced documents: the list of ISBs
(CHELEBIAN000000037 - CHELEBIAN000000041) and the list of TSBs
(CHELEBIAN000000042 - CHELEBIAN000000043) for vehicles of the same year, make
and model as the SUBJECT VEHICLE; Bulletins/Recalls applicable to the SUBJECT
VEHICLE (CHELEBIAN000000029 - CHELEBIAN000000036, CHELEBIAN000000073 -
CHELEBIAN000000152, and CHELEBIAN000009640 - CHELEBIAN000009743); and specific
TSBs (CHELEBIAN000009744 - CHELEBIAN000009775). Additionally, a court
representative from GM has verified this response. Further, as to Request No.
25 GM argues that it has complied in whole and has produced documents in its
possession, custody, or control responsive to this Request, and refers
Plaintiff to the following produced documents: the list of ISBs
(CHELEBIAN000000037 - CHELEBIAN000000041) and the list of TSBs
(CHELEBIAN000000042 - CHELEBIAN000000043) for vehicles of the same year, make
and model as the SUBJECT VEHICLE; Bulletins/Recalls applicable to the SUBJECT
VEHICLE (CHELEBIAN000000029 - CHELEBIAN000000036, CHELEBIAN000000073 -
CHELEBIAN000000152, and CHELEBIAN000009640 - CHELEBIAN000009743); and specific
TSBs (CHELEBIAN000009744 - CHELEBIAN000009775). Additionally, a court
representative from GM has verified this response. 
 
Next, as to this Court’s fifth
question, as to RFP NO. 76, Gm contends it has complied in whole and had
produced documents in its possession, custody, or control responsive to this
Request, and refers Plaintiff to the following produced documents: the list of
ISBs (CHELEBIAN000000037 - CHELEBIAN000000041) and the list of TSBs
(CHELEBIAN000000042 - CHELEBIAN000000043) for vehicles of the same year, make
and model as the SUBJECT VEHICLE; Bulletins/Recalls applicable to the SUBJECT
VEHICLE (CHELEBIAN000000029 - CHELEBIAN000000036, CHELEBIAN000000073 -
CHELEBIAN000000152, and CHELEBIAN000009640 - CHELEBIAN000009743); and specific
TSBs (CHELEBIAN000009744 - CHELEBIAN000009775). Additionally, a court
representative from GM has verified this response. Additionally, as to RFP No.
79, GM asserts it has complied in whole and has produced documents in its
possession, custody, or control responsive to this Request, and refers
Plaintiff to the following produced documents: the list of ISBs
(CHELEBIAN000000037 - CHELEBIAN000000041) and the list of TSBs (CHELEBIAN000000042
- CHELEBIAN000000043) for vehicles of the same year, make and model as the SUBJECT
VEHICLE; Bulletins/Recalls applicable to the SUBJECT VEHICLE
(CHELEBIAN000000029 - CHELEBIAN000000036, CHELEBIAN000000073 -
CHELEBIAN000000152, and CHELEBIAN000009640 - CHELEBIAN000009743); and specific
TSBs (CHELEBIAN000009744 - CHELEBIAN000009775). Additionally, a court
representative from GM has verified this response. 
 
Lastly, GM contends that this Court
stated it was willing to excuse the three (3) day delay in GM providing
verifications as long as GM agrees that they are barred from arguing or
offering evidence later in the case that the November 9, 2023, verification did
not apply to the Court-ordered supplemental response and documents produced on
November 6th. GM asserts that it is agreeable to this.  But before the the Court excuses the delay, it
was and still is expecting more of an explanation for the failure to provide a
verification on the same date as the written response and production.
 
            Here,
it appears that, as requested by this Court, that Defendant has complied with much
of the discovery in which it claims it has done so. GM has also provided this
Court with the Bates numbers of the responsive documents, as requested. But Ms.
Randolph’s declaration lists a number of shortcomings of the supplemental document
production.  The Court will continue the hearing
to enable GM to provide a point by point response to Ms. Randolph’s declaration
which is thus far leaving the Court with a record demonstrating that GM still
has failed to provide other customers’ complaints, still has failed to provide letter
of mails between GM employees and NHTSA or EPA bearing on the same types of
battery complaints that Plaintiff here reported to repairing dealers, and other
documents.
