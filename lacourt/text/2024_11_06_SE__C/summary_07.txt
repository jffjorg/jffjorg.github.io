And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the unopposed motion of the plaintiffs, Michael Anthony Sguigna, Maryann Sguigna, and Joseph Sguigna, to set aside the dismissal that was entered on May 9, 2024. The motion was filed by the new counsel for the plaintiffs, Constantinos Pavlakos, who claimed that the failure to appear at the hearing was due to an inadvertent calendaring error by the former counsel, Victor Ujkic. Ujkic took a medical leave of absence without proper coverage measures in place, resulting in the failure to appear and the entry of dismissal. The judge found that this was an excusable neglect and that the plaintiffs have established a right to relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). As no opposition was filed, the court granted the motion.
