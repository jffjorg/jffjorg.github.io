And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has taken the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One off the calendar. The motion was filed by Shen Rui against Forest River, Inc. in a Song-Beverly action related to a 2022 Coachmen Leprechaun 260 DS. The court had previously ordered the parties to make further efforts to meet and confer to resolve their discovery disputes and to submit a revised joint separate statement on or before October 25, 2024. However, as of November 1, 2024, the parties have failed to file the revised joint separate statement and have not notified the court of any issues or difficulties in doing so. Therefore, the motion is taken off the calendar.
