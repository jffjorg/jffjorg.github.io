TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Plaintiff Sean
Antoine Dennis’s motion to compel further responses to Request for Production
of Documents (Set One) is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part as set forth
below.  
 
Moving party to give notice. 
 
This is a
Song-Beverly action about a 2019 Jaguar F-Pace. Plaintiff moves to compel
further responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, request numbers
1 through 31.
 
On August 14, 2024, the Court continued the motion to
November 6, 2024 and ordered counsel to make further efforts to meet and
confer. The Court required counsel to submit a revised joint separate statement
on or before October 25, 2024, if counsel are unable to informally resolve
their discovery disputes. 
 
On October 25, 2024, the parties filed their joint separate
statement.  
 
“On
receipt of a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further response
to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the following apply: (1)
A state of compliance with the demand is incomplete. (2) A representation of
inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. (3) An objection in
the response is without merit or too general.” (CCP §2031.310(a).)  
A
motion to compel further responses to a request for production “shall set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
inspection demand.” (CCP §2031.310(b)(1).)  
 
The following
RPDs remain at issue: RPD numbers 1 through 31. 
 
Per the
Declaration of Joshua Kohanoff in support of the motion, request numbers 1
through 14 relate to Plaintiff’s own vehicle; request numbers 15 through 29
relate to Defendant’s warranty and repurchase policies, procedures, and
practices; and request numbers 30 and 31 relate to Defendant’s knowledge of the
same or similar defects in other vehicles of the same, year, make, and model. (Declaration
of Joshua Kohanoff ¶ 17, Ex. 3.)
 
Per the joint
separate statement, Plaintiff states that Defendant asserts objections on the
grounds of privilege to request numbers 1 through 31, however, Defendant has
failed to furnish a privilege log. As to request numbers 17 through 29, Defendant
asserts improper statements of noncompliance in its supplemental responses that
“the particular item or category never existed.” Further, request numbers 30
and 31, which requests Defendant to produce TREAD complaints that are
substantially similar to the alleged defects claimed by Plaintiff, relate to
the Court’s February 7, 2024, Case Management Conference Order. Category (h) of
the Case Management Conference Order provides: “A list or
compilation of customer complaints in Defendant’s electronically stored
database that are substantially similar to the alleged defects claimed by
Plaintiff, in vehicles purchased in California for the same year, make, and
model of the subject vehicle. . .” 
 
Defendant’s position per the joint separate statement is as
follows. Defendant’s response that it cannot comply because the document never
existed complies with CCP §2031.230. Defendant has
objected as to privilege to preserve its objection, however, Defendant is not
withholding any documents based on privilege. Defendant has already offered to
produce its policy and procedure documents pursuant to a protective order; and
Defendant is amendable to the LASC model protective order and will produce the
documents upon execution of a stipulated protective order. Lastly, as to
request numbers 30 and 31, the requested TREAD REPORTS are publicly available
on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website. 
 
The Motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part as set
forth below.  
 
Request numbers
1 through 14 relate to Plaintiff’s own vehicle and are thus within the proper
scope of discovery.  As to these
requests, the motion is GRANTED.  
 
Request numbers
15, 16, 18, 23, 24 relate to Defendant’s policies and procedures which
Defendant has already offered to produce subject to a protective order.  As to these requests, the motion is
DENIED.  
 
As to Request
numbers 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, and 29, Defendant’s supplemental
responses indicate that the documents never existed.  The Court finds that the responses comply
with CCP §2031.230.  Thus, the motion to compel further responses
to these requests is DENIED.   
 
As to request numbers 30 and 31, the Court limits
Plaintiff’s requests to documents that are not publicly available NHTSA
documents. 
 
 
Plaintiff does
not request sanctions, and the Court declines to award sanctions.
