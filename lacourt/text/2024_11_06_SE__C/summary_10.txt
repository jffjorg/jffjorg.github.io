And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to Requests for Production of Documents (Set One). The motion is granted in part and denied in part.

The judge grants the motion as to requests 1 through 14, which relate to the plaintiff's own vehicle, and requests 15, 16, 18, 23, and 24, which relate to the defendant's policies and procedures.

The judge denies the motion as to requests 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, and 29, which are either objected to on grounds of privilege or where the defendant has provided a supplemental response indicating that the documents never existed.

The judge limits the plaintiff's requests as to requests 30 and 31, which relate to the defendant's knowledge of similar defects in other vehicles, to documents that are not publicly available on the NHTSA website.

The judge declines to award sanctions and instructs the parties to give notice of the ruling.
