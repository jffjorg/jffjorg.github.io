Analysis
 
Legal Standard re: Motion to Declare Vexatious Litigant
 
Code of Civil Procedure Section 391, subdivision (b),
defines a “vexatious litigant” as a person who, “[a]fter a litigation has been
finally determined against the person, repeatedly relitigates or attempts to
relitigate, in propria persona, either (i) the validity of the determination
against the same defendant or defendants as to whom the litigation was finally
determined or (ii) the cause of action, claim, controversy, or any of the
issues of fact or law, determined or concluded by the final determination
against the same defendant or defendants as to whom the litigation was finally
determined…[i]n any litigation while acting in propria persona, repeatedly
files unmeritorious motions, pleadings, or other papers, conducts unnecessary
discovery, or engages in other tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to
cause unnecessary delay….” (Code Civ. Proc., § 391, subd. (b)(1)-(3).) “ ‘Litigation’
means any civil action or proceeding, commenced, maintained or pending in any
state or federal court.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 391, subd. (a).)  
 
“Except as provided in subdivision (b), if, after hearing
the evidence upon the motion, the court determines that the plaintiff is a
vexatious litigant and that there is no reasonable probability that the
plaintiff will prevail in the litigation against the moving defendant, the
court shall order the plaintiff to furnish, for the benefit of the moving
defendant, security in such amount and within such time as the court shall
fix.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 391.3, subd. (a).)
 
“In addition to any other relief provided in this title, the
court may, on its own motion or the motion of any party, enter a prefiling
order which prohibits a vexatious litigant from filing any new litigation in
the courts of this state in propria persona without first obtaining leave of
the presiding¿justice or presiding¿judge of the court where the litigation is
proposed to be filed. Disobedience of the order by a vexatious litigant may be
punished as a contempt of court.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 391.7, subd. (a).)
 
          Merits of
the Motion
 
Here, Defendant filed a Complaint for Forcible Detainer
against Plaintiff on March 9, 2022 in Case No. 22NWCV00168 (“U/A” or
“Underlying Action”). (RJN, Ex. 001.) The U/A came for a bench trial on May 2,
2022 and resulted in a judgment against Plaintiff. (RJN, Exs. 005-006.)
Restitution and possession of the premises located at 11747 E Carson Street,
Lakewood, CA 90715 (the “Property”) was granted for Defendant. (Id.) Defendant
contends since the judgment in the U/A, Plaintiff has filed 21 unsuccessful
litigations as a pro per plaintiff or petitioner during the last three
years against Defendant and/or its representatives and counsel. (RJN, Exs. 040,
042, 046, 052, 055, 058, 061, 065, 068, 075, 084, 087, 090, 093, 098, 104, 106,
111, 115, 018, 125.) These litigations concerned the same claims and sought the
same relief demanded in this present case, which is the eviction that resulted
after judgment in the U/A. (Mem. of P&A at 4:8-12.) Essentially, in this
present lawsuit and the previous lawsuits, Plaintiff seeks to relitigate the
forcible detainer action wherein possession of the Property was granted to
Defendant. The evidence provided by Defendant also shows that Plaintiff has
filed several motions, pleadings, and other papers related to these litigations
to attack the judgment rendered in the U/A. As such, Plaintiff is a “vexatious
litigant” as set forth in Code of Civil Procedure Section 391, subdivision
(b)(1)-(3). 
 
Furthermore, the Court finds that no reasonable probability
exists that Plaintiff will prevail in this instant case against Defendant because
the present lawsuit is barred by issue preclusion. “[I]ssue preclusion applies
(1) after final adjudication (2) of an identical issue (3) actually litigated
and necessarily decided in the first suit and (4) asserted against one who was
a party in the first suit or one in privity with that party.” (Tukes v.
Richard (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 1, 21.) As discussed above, the U/A resulted
in a final judgment after a bench trial, thus it was a final judgment on the
merits. Moreover, the issue of adverse possession was actually litigated and
necessarily decided in the U/A. (Radford Decl., ¶¶8-9.) Finally, the issue of
adverse possession is being asserted against Defendant, who was the original
Plaintiff in the U/A against the Plaintiff is this case. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant BV Lakewood Carson SE
LLC’s motion to declare vexatious litigant and prefiling order is GRANTED. 
 
Plaintiff Elizabeth Thomas is ordered to furnish $50,000.00
as security within 30 days of this order. 
 
Plaintiff is also prohibited from filing any new litigation
in the courts of this state in propria persona without first obtaining leave of
the presiding¿justice or presiding¿judge of the court where the litigation is
proposed to be filed.
