Moving Party to give Notice. 
 
This personal injury action was filed by
Plaintiffs Syed Fakhar Shah, Muhammad Shah, and Syeda Quratulain on January 31,
2023, against Defendants J.R. Republic
and Manuel Angel Molina Chavez. The complaint alleges four causes of action for:
(1) negligence, (2) negligence per se, (3) negligent entrustment, and (4) negligent
hiring, supervision and retention, and arises out of a vehicle collision.
 
Defendants move to compel Plaintiff Shah’s deposition and request
sanctions. Plaintiff Shah’s counsel has filed a declaration in opposition.
 
CCP section¿2025.450(a) provides:¿“If, after service
of a deposition notice, a party to the action . . . , without having served a
valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to
proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document . . . described in
the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and
testimony, and the production for inspection of any document . . . described in
the deposition notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450(a).) 
CCP section¿2025.450(b)
provides:¿“A motion under subdivision (a)… shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to
attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance.”¿ (Id., § 2025.450(b).) 
Defendants’
counsel originally noticed Plaintiff Shah’s deposition on March 16, 2023, to be
taken remotely on June 16, 2023. (Renaud Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. A.) On June 7, 2023,
Plaintiffs’ counsel objected to the deposition of Plaintiff Shah set for June
16, 2023. (Renaud Decl. ¶ 5, Exh. B.) On August 7, 2023, Plaintiffs’ counsel
advised Defendants’ counsel that Plaintiff Shah would be available for
deposition on September 25, 27, and 28 and that he would require a conference
room. (Renaud Decl. ¶ 8, Exh. E.) On August 8, 2023, Defendants served their
Second Notice of Deposition of Plaintiff Shah set for September 25, 2023.
(Renaud Decl. ¶ 9, Exh. F.) 
On August 10,
2023, Plaintiffs’ counsel advised that Plaintiff Shah lives in Bakersfield and
cannot attend the in-person deposition on September 25, 2023, in Long Beach,
California. (Renaud Decl. ¶ 10, Exh. G.) On August 17, 2023, Defendants served
their Third Notice of Deposition of Plaintiff Shah set in person in Bakersfield
on September 25, 2023, pursuant to Plaintiffs’ request. (Renaud Decl. ¶ 11, Exh.
H.) On September 22, 2023, Plaintiffs’ counsel emailed Defendants’ counsel and
advised that his client was no longer available for his deposition on September
25, 2023. (Renaud Decl. ¶ 12, Exh. I.)
On September
26, 2023, Plaintiffs’ counsel provided additional dates for Plaintiff Shah in
October 2023. (Id.) Defendants then served a Fourth Notice of Taking Deposition
of Plaintiff Shah on September 27, 2023 to take place on October 20, 2023.
(Renaud Decl. ¶ 13, Exhibit “J”.) Plaintiff Shah once again canceled the
deposition the day before. (Renaud Decl. ¶ 14, Exh. K.) 
On April 30,
2024, Defendants’ counsel made one last effort to obtain a date before filing
this motion. (Renaud Decl. ¶ 21, Exh. R.) No response was ever forthcoming. 
As Plaintiff was properly served with the
notice of deposition, did not object under CCP section 2025.410, and failed to proceed with the deposition,
the motion to compel Plaintiff to appear for deposition is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ordered to appear for deposition within 30 days of
this order.
Sanctions
 
If a motion under CCP section¿2025.450(a) is granted, the court shall impose a
monetary sanction in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against
the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. (CCP section¿2025.450(g)(1).)
 
Defendants request sanctions against Plaintiff and counsel
of record in the amount of $1,282.50, which consists of $185 for Defendants’ counsel’s
hourly rate, for 4.5 hours, $450 for the late cancelation. (See Renaud Decl., ¶
23, Exh. S.)  
 
As the motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition is granted,
Defendant’s request for
sanctions is granted in part. Plaintiff’s counsel has filed a declaration
stating that despite attempts at contacting Plaintiff, he has been unable to
locate Plaintiff. (Mosley Decl., ¶ 4.) As such, Plaintiff’s counsel has
provided substantial justification for the failure to proceed with Plaintiff’s
deposition, however, Plaintiff has not. Thus, the Court imposes sanctions
against Plaintiff and in favor of Defendants, in the reduced amount of $1,005 ($185 per hour for 3 hours, plus $450 cancelation fee), to be
paid within 30 days of this order.
