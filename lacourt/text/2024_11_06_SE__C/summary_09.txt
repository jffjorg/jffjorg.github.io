And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling in the case of C Moore v. Westlake Services, LLC (Case Number 23NWCV02067). The case is a breach of contract action that was filed on July 5, 2023. A Notice of Settlement was filed on June 24, 2024. The Judge has denied Plaintiff Jayshaud Chenevert's Ex Parte Application for Expedited Partial Settlement Disbursement.

The Judge found that the parties have properly requested that the Court retain jurisdiction to enforce their settlement agreement. However, the Judge also found that the Ex Parte Application is defective for failure to attach a Declaration regarding notice in compliance with CRC Rule 3.1204(b).

The Judge also ruled that Plaintiff Chenevert's request for immediate release of $15,000.00 from the settlement funds held in trust goes beyond the terms of the parties' Settlement Agreement. The Settlement Agreement requires Defendant to pay $30,055.53 to Plaintiffs Haley N. Moore and Jayshaud Bernette Chenevert, payable into a trust account. The Judge notes that there is no requirement in the Settlement Agreement that the funds must be distributed equally between the Plaintiffs, and therefore the Court lacks authority to enforce Plaintiff Chenevert's request.
