 Case Number:  23NWCV01774    Hearing Date:   November 6, 2024    Dept:  C Michael Anthony
Sguigna, et al. v. Cody Ballard, et al.
CASE NO.:  23NWCV01774
HEARING:  11/06/24
 
#8
TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Plaintiffs Michael Anthony Sguigna, Maryann Sguigna and
Joseph Sguigna’s unopposed Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Dismissal is GRANTED.
 
Moving party to give notice. 
 
No Opposition filed as of October 23, 2024.
 
Plaintiffs’ counsel moves
for an order to vacate the dismissal entered on May 9, 2024 pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 473(b). Plaintiffs’ counsel contends that the
failure to appear at the May 9, 2024 hearing was due to Plaintiffs’ counsel
making an inadvertent calendaring error as to the hearing date. This error
by Plaintiffs’ former counsel Victor Ujkic (“Counsel”) resulted from Counsel
taking a medical leave of absence without proper coverage measures in place for
upcoming hearings. As a result, Plaintiffs failed to appear at the hearing causing
entry of dismissal. 
 
No opposition has
been received.
 
Legal Standard
 
Judges must vacate
dismissals, default entries, and default judgments “whenever (1) an application
is made no more than six months after entry of judgment, (2) the application is
accompanied by an attorney's sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, and (3) the attorney's mistake,
inadvertence, surprise or neglect in fact caused the dismissal or entry of
default.”¿ (Benedict v. Danner Press (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 923, 927,
Wagner v. Wagner (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 249, 258.)
 
Discussion
 
The motion was timely filed on August 9, 2024, within the
six-month statutory period.
 
Plaintiffs’ counsel Constantinos
Pavlakos has established by his declaration that the May 9, 2024 dismissal was
entered due to excusable neglect by Plaintiffs’ former counsel Victor Ujkic in
failing to properly calendar. Mr. Pavlakos noted that this calendaring error
occurred because Mr. Ujkic took a
medical leave of absence without proper coverage measures in place for upcoming
hearings causing Plaintiffs’ failure to appear at the hearing and the entry of
dismissal. (Pavlakos Decl. ¶¶ 4–5.) Therefore, pursuant to the mandatory
provision of the Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), the court
find that Plaintiffs Michael Anthony Sguigna, Maryann Sguigna and Joseph
Sguigna have established a right to relief. As no opposition was received, the
court will grant the motion on this basis.
Conclusion
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ Motion to Set Aside/Vacate
Dismissal.
