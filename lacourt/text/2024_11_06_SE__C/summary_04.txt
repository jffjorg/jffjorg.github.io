Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling declaring Plaintiff Elizabeth Thomas a vexatious litigant and ordering her to furnish $50,000.00 as security. The court also prohibits Plaintiff from filing any new litigation in the courts of this state in propria persona without first obtaining leave of the presiding judge or judge of the court where the litigation is proposed to be filed. The ruling is based on Plaintiff's repeated filings of unmeritorious motions and pleadings, as well as her failure to obtain leave of the court before filing new litigation. The court finds that Plaintiff has repeatedly relitigated or attempted to relitigate the validity of the determination against the same defendant or defendants, and that Plaintiff has filed 21 unsuccessful litigations against Defendant and/or its representatives and counsel. The court also finds that Plaintiff is barred by issue preclusion, as the present lawsuit is barred by the judgment rendered in the Underlying Action.
