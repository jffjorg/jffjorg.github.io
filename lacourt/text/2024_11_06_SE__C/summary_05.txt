And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel the deposition of plaintiff Syed Shah. The plaintiff failed to comply with the deposition notice and has not provided a valid objection under CCP section 2025.410. The judge has also granted the defendants' request for sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $1,005. This amount is reduced from the original request of $1,282.50 because the plaintiff's counsel has provided substantial justification for the failure to locate the plaintiff. The sanctions are to be paid within 30 days of the order.
