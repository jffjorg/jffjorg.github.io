And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motions to compel the plaintiff's responses to form interrogatories and request for production of documents. The plaintiff, Fariba Santos, is ordered to provide verified responses without objections to the discovery requests within 30 days. The judge has also granted the defendants' request for sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel, Liana Ter-Oganesyan, in the amount of $620, to be paid within 30 days. The sanctions are mandatory due to the plaintiff's failure to respond to the discovery requests, which waives all objections, including privilege and work product. The judge's decision is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290, 2031.300, and 2023.030, which provide for the compulsory discovery process and sanctions for failure to comply.
