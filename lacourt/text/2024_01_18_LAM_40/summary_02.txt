English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case between Samir B. Armaly, as cotrustee of the Samir B. Armaly and Kelly R. Armaly Revocable Trust, and Stephen L. Goodman, Matthew Yang, Chris Chorebanian, and Fidares Group, LLC. The case involves a breach of contract and guaranty claim arising from a loan agreement between Armaly and the Buyers. The Buyers failed to make payments on the loan, and Armaly demands summary judgment against them. The judge grants Armaly's motion for summary judgment, finding that the evidence presented by Armaly shows a prima facie case for breach of guaranty. The judge also finds that Yang, Chorebanian, and Fidares are liable under the Agreement and that their opposition to the motion does not provide grounds for summary judgment in their favor. The judge orders that Armaly be awarded $537,611.39.
