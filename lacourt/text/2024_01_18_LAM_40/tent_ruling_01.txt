Background
Initial Pleadings and Judgment
On January 25, 2019, Plaintiff First American Properties and
Acquisitions, Inc. (First American) filed a Complaint suing Defendants Fornia
Hospitality Group, LLC (Fornia), Jatkinder K. Shante (J. Shante), Satwant C.
Chethal (S. Chetal), Bhupinder S. Shante (B. Shante), Harban S. Chehal (H. Chetal),
and Does 1 through 25.
The Complaint alleged claims of (1) Breach of Written Contract and
Promissory Note, (2) Breach of Guarantee, (3) Breach of Security Agreement and
Possession of Collateral, (4) Unjust Enrichment, (5) Money Had and Received,
and (6) Account Stated.
The claims arose from allegations that in exchange for certain collateral
and pursuant to a promissory note, First American’s assignor, the United States
Small Business Administration (SBA), loaned Defendants $1,347,000, a loan on
which Defendants defaulted in August 2017 by failing to make monthly payments.
On August 20, 2019, Plaintiff First American dismissed Defendants S.
Chetal and H. Chetal from this action, without prejudice.
On October 16, 2020, Defendant J. Shante moved for summary judgment in
Shante’s favor as against Plaintiff First American.
On February 18, 2021, Plaintiff First American opposed Defendant J.
Shante’s motion for summary judgment. 
That same day, Plaintiff First American filed a motion for leave to file
a First Amended Complaint (FAC).
On February 22, 2021, Plaintiff First American filed its proposed FAC.
The FAC added Fornia Hospitality & Investments, LLC (Fornia H&I) as a
Defendant and reduced the causes of action to (1) Breach of Guarantee against
J. Shante, B. Shante and Does 1 through 10 and (2) Judicial Foreclosure on Deed
of Trust against Fornia, Fornia H&I, and Does 1 through 20.
On February 26, 2021, Defendant J. Sander replied to Plaintiff First
American’s opposition to the motion for summary judgment.
On March 2, 2021, Defendants Fornia, J. Shante, and B. Shante opposed
Plaintiff First American’s motion for leave to file a FAC.
On March 4, 2021, the Court heard and granted Defendant J. Shante’s
motion for summary judgment. The Court determined that Shante made a prima
facie showing that no triable issues of material fact existed as to the
Complaint’s claims based on the claims being time barred and that First
American failed to make a sufficient rebuttal showing.
On March 16, 2021, the Court heard and denied Plaintiff First American’s
motion for leave to file its FAC. The Court reasoned that the proposed FAC did
not add new fact(s) to the Breach of Guarantee claim, which failed on summary
judgment, and that the proposed FAC’s new Judicial Foreclosure claim was futile
and did not favor granting leave to amend given that the claim would also be
time barred.
On March 24, 2021, Defendants Fornia, J. Shante, and S. Shante filed a
proposed judgment.
On April 13, 2021, the Court signed the proposed judgment, adjudging and
decreeing that Plaintiff, First American Properties and Acquisitions, Inc.,
shall take nothing by this action, and Defendants Fornia, J. Shante, and B.
Shante shall recover from First
American the costs of suit per memorandum of costs if allowed.
Fees and Costs in Trial Court Proceedings, Appeal, and Remittitur
On April 27, 2023, Defendants Fornia, J. Shante, and B. Shante filed a
motion for attorney fees and costs pursuant to a contractual agreement for that
relief in the loan agreement with the SBA.
That same day, these Defendants filed a memorandum of costs.
May 10, 2021, Plaintiff First American appealed the judgment after grant
of summary judgment.
On July 8, 2021, Plaintiff First American opposed the motion for attorney
fees and costs.
On July 14, 2021, Defendants Fornia, J. Shante, and B. Shante replied to
the opposition to fees and costs.
On July 21, 2021, the Court granted the motion for attorney fees and
costs, in part.
That same day, the Court dismissed Fornia H&I from this action.
On July 26, 2023, the court of appeal issued its opinion in Plaintiff
First American’s appeal, which affirmed the Court’s judgment and awarded
Defendant J. Shante costs on appeal.
On October 5, 2023, the court of appeal issued its remittitur to the
Clerk.
Motion Before the Court - Fees and
Costs on Appeal
On November 14, 2023, Defendant J.
Shante filed a motion for attorney fees and costs related to the appeal
proceedings and the motion itself.
That same day, Defendant J. Shante
filed a memorandum of costs.
On January 4, 2024, Plaintiff First
American opposed the motion for fees and costs.
On January 10, 2024, Defendant J.
Shante replied to the opposition.
Defendant J. Shante’s motion for
attorney fees and costs is now before the Court.
 
Motion for Attorney Fees and Costs
Legal Standard 

Attorney’s fees are recoverable as costs on appeal. (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 8.278.) “[T]o collect appellate attorney fees, a party must
demonstrate the right to do so under either a statute or a contract,
independent of a costs statute.” (Butler-Rupp v. Lourdeaux (2007) 154
Cal.App.4th 918, 927; see Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a) [award when contract
between the parties specifically provides for fees and costs and one party
prevails over the other on the contract].)
The
Court begins a fees award inquiry “with the ‘lodestar [ method]’ i.e., the
number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.”
(PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) From there, the
“lodestar figure may then be adjusted [according to a multiplier enhancement]
based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee
at the fair market value for the legal services provided.” (Ibid.)
Relevant multiplier factors include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the
questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent
to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v.
Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)
No
specific findings reflecting the court’s calculations for attorney’s fees are
required; the record need only show that the attorney’s fees were awarded
according to the “lodestar” or “touchstone” approach. (Rebney v. Wells Fargo
Bank (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1344, 1349, disagreed with on other grounds in In
re Marriage of Demblewski (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 232, 236, fn. 7
[disagreement as to statement of decision requirements].) The Court has broad
discretion to determine the amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee award, which
will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial
error of law, or necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi
v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-1394.)
Order
Granting Fees and Costs: GRANTED, in part.
Plaintiff
seeks a court order granting $48,385.62 in fees related to J. Shante’s defense
of the judgment on appeal and in relation to this motion, as well as $540 in
recoverable costs. (See Mot., p. 4.)
I. Applicability of Civ. Code, § 1717, Fees,
and Reciprocity
Where
a contract specifically provides for an award of attorney fees, recovery of
attorney fees is allowed by whichever contracting party prevails, regardless of
whether the contract specifies that party. (Hart v. Clear Recon Corp.
(2018) 27 Cal.App.5th 322, 326, citing Cargill, Inc. v. Souza (2011) 201
Cal.App.4th 962, 966.) 
Here,
the court of appeal allowed Defendant J. Shante to recover costs on appeal,
which may include attorney’s fees when allowed by statute, contract, or law.
(See 10/4/23 Remittitur, p. 15; Coded Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10); see
also Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subds. (a)(4), (b) [costs as matter of right to
prevailing party].) Shante also prevailed on appeal and points to the fees
clause in the loan agreement to support entitlement to fees. (See 10/4/23
Remittitur, p. 15; see also Mot., pp. 5-7 [discussion of award by court of
appeals, applicability of Civ. Code, § 1717, attorney’s fees clause, and
prevailing party discussion]; Mot., Mann Decl., ¶ 2, citing Mot., Mann Decl.,
Ex. A, § 9.A. [clause pursuant to which Shante as Guarantor for the loan agreed
to pay for legal fees incurred by the lender to enforce the guarantee in the
loan agreement as against Shante].)
Based
on the Enforcement Expenses clause in the loan agreement, the outcome and award
of the appeal, and the reciprocity of section 1717, Defendant J. Shante is
entitled to reasonable fees and costs as the prevailing party on appeal. (See Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 1717, subd. (a); see also 1032, subds. (a)(4), (b), 1033.5,
subd. (a)(10).)
II. Reasonable Fee Rates
Defendant
J. Shante argues that the fee rate sought for the work of counsel on appeal and
in relation to this motion—work of Lloyd S. Mann, Esq. (Mann), under two law
firms, at a rate of $350 per hour—is reasonable because Mann is charging a
discounted rate from between $375 to $475 per hour and because the rate is
below market for attorneys with similar skills and experience at comparable law
firms. Shante also argues that Mann’s summary of qualifications supports the
requested fee rate. (Mot., p. 10.)
In
opposition, Plaintiff First American challenges only the reasonableness of the
hours expended, not the fee rate requested by Defendant J. Shante. (See Opp’n,
pp. 2-3.)
In
reply, Defendant J. Shante supports the reasonableness of the hours expended by
counsel on appeal and in relation to this motion without discussing fee rates.
(See Reply, pp. 2-5.)
The
Court finds that the fee rate of $350 per hour is reasonable.
Lloyd
Mann is a 40-year practitioner that has provided a declaration briefly summarizing
Mann’s legal career. (Mot., Mann Decl., ¶ 6.) A rate of $350 per hour for a
long-time practitioner that was successful on appeal is more than reasonable
for attorneys of similar experience in the Los Angeles County area.
III. Reasonable Hours
Defendant
J. Shante argues that an unspecified number of hours expended by counsel on
appeal and on this motion justified the requested fee award. Shante supports
the request by contending that the statute-of-limitations argument upon which
Shante prevailed was clear early on in the litigation and that a new attorney
came into the case to file the appeal for the plaintiffs, and thus defendants
had to conduct a substantial amount of additional research given the new perspective.
Shante also argues that the appeal, which was successful, involved difficult
issues in a specialized area of federal and state law relating to loans SBA
loans. Shante adds that the case staffing was appropriate because no more than
one attorney worked on the assignment at a time and none of the work performed
or billed could have been performed by a non-attorney. Last, Shante argues that
the time spent on this motion was reasonable because it comprises the amount of
time necessary to review billing records and prepare the moving papers and
supporting exhibits. (Mot., pp. 8-9.)
In
opposition, Plaintiff First American challenges two entries in the billing
records that reflect work in the trial court proceedings and thus involves fees
requested in a prior motion. First American then challenges various specific
time entries in the verified billing records filed in the moving papers.
(Opp’n, pp. 2-3.)
In
reply, Defendant J. Shante argues that the appeal was reviewed de novo,
requiring a fresh look at the record, where case law advises that practitioners
should not rely on legal research from trial court proceedings when advancing
or defending an appeal. While Shante concedes that time entries for April and
May 2021 are not recoverable, Shante argues that the hours expended by counsel
on appeal were reasonable, particularly where much of the time expended by
counsel was responsive to Plaintiff First American’s litigation conduct.
(Opp’n, pp. 2-3.)
The
Court finds that most of the hours expended on the appeal and on this motion
are reasonable.
The
hours in the billing records detailing $3,439 in fees for trial court
proceedings between April and May 2021 are not recoverable, as conceded in the
reply.
Neither
are the other trial court proceeding entries recoverable, i.e., the July 12 to
21, 2021 and September 22, 2021 fees work, totaling $3,167.50 in reduced fees,
with the July 13 and 22, 2021 entries split in half for the stated work. (Mot.,
Mann Decl., Ex. B.)
The
Court otherwise finds that the hours expended on appeal and on this motion are
reasonable.
Defendant
J. Shante’s motion is thus GRANTED, in part, in the amount of $41,779.12.
IV. Multiplier Enhancement
No
multiplier enhancement award is sought by Defendant J. Shante, for which reason
this topic is not further discussed.
V. Costs
Within
40 days after issuance of the remittitur, a party claiming costs awarded by a
reviewing court must serve and file in the superior court a verified memorandum
of costs under rule 3.1700. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.278, subd. (c)(1).)
The
Court of appeal issued remittitur on October 5, 2023 and awarded costs.
(10/4/23 Remittitur, pp. 1, 15.)
On
November 14, 2023—exactly 40 days after the issuance of remittitur—Defendant J.
Shante filed a memorandum of costs.
Defendant
J. Shante’s briefing focuses solely on fees while concluding on various
occasions without elaboration that costs should also be granted. The costs are
summarized in the memorandum of costs. (See Mot., pp. 2-11 [notice and points
and authorities, references at pp 2, 3, 10, 11]; 11/14/23 Memo of Costs [$390
in filing fees and $150 in expenses relating to printing and copying briefs].)
Plaintiff
First American did not file a motion to strike or tax the memorandum of costs.
The failure to do so waived any opposition to costs. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
8.278, subd. (c)(2) [timeframe for challenging costs on appeal, adopting Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1700]; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, subd. (b)(1) [motion
to strike or tax costs to be filed within 15 days of service of costs
memorandum]; Griffith v. Wellbanks & Co. (1915) 26 Cal.App. 477, 480
(Griffith) [“In other words, the terms of [Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033] are mandatory, and a substantially strict compliance therewith is
required, not alone of the party claiming costs, but also of the party
dissatisfied with the costs claimed,” emphasis added]; cf. Hydratec,
Inc. v. Sun Valley 260 Orchard & Vineyard Co. (1990) 223 Cal.App.3d
924, 929 (Hydratec) [“The time provisions relating to the filing of a
memorandum of costs, while not jurisdictional, are mandatory, ” citing
authority derived from Griffith]; see, e.g., Sanabria v. Embrey
(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 422, 426 [holding a trial court erred by granting
untimely costs request, citing Hydratec].)
The
Clerk should thus enter costs on the appeal. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.278, subds.
(c)(1)-(2); Cal Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, subd. (b)(4).) 

Conclusion
Defendants Fornia Hospitality
Group, LLC, Jatkinder K. Shante, and Bhupinder S. Shante’s Motion for Attorney
Fees of $48,385.62 and Costs of $540.00 After Appeal is GRANTED, in part, in
the amount of $41,779.12.
The Clerk is notified of the need
to enter costs on the appeal. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.278, subds. (c)(1)-(2);
Cal Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, subd. (b)(4).)
