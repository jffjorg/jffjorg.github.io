And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Marine One Acceptance Corporation, has filed a motion to vacate the dismissal of their case against defendants Justin Maglasang and Steve Gordon. The motion is based on Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), which provides for relief from an involuntary dismissal due to attorney fault. However, the motion was not filed within the six-month deadline, which is jurisdictional and not subject to tolling. Therefore, the motion is denied.

The plaintiff also argues that relief is available on equitable grounds, citing extrinsic mistake and diligence in seeking relief. However, the court finds that the plaintiff has not shown a satisfactory excuse for failing to appear at the order to show cause, and that the delay in filing the motion was unreasonable. Therefore, the request for equitable relief is also denied.

In conclusion, the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal is denied.
