Discussion
 
Pursuant
to Civil Code section 798.61, Petitioner
seeks a court order deeming the mobilehome (“the Mobilehome”), located at 17350
E. Temple Ave Space 308, La Puente, California (“the Space”), to be abandoned,
and awarding Petitioner rent due on the Mobilehome site from July 1, 2022 to
the present, accruing at $1,102.00 per month, plus other applicable charges,
costs, and attorney’s fees. (Pet., ¶6 and Prayer ¶¶1-6.) 
 
A.         Determination of “Abandoned
Mobilehome”—Civ. Code § 798.61(a)(1)
 
Pursuant
to Civil Code, section 798.61, subdivision (a)(1), an “abandoned mobilehome” means
a mobilehome about which all of the following are true:
 
(A) It is located in a
mobilehome park on a site for which no rent has been paid to the management for
the preceding 60 days.
 
(B)
It is unoccupied.
 
(C)
A reasonable person would believe it to be abandoned.
 
(D)
It is not permanently affixed to the land.
 
(Civ. Code, § 798.61, subd. (a)(1).) The Petition is
supported by the declaration of Petitioner’s manager, Sofia Lopez, who states
that Respondent Denise is the registered owner of the Mobilehome, and
Respondents David and Lucy are the legal owners. (Pet., Lopez Decl., ¶4 and
Exh. 2.) No rent has been paid for the Space since June 2022, and the mobile
home has been unoccupied for at least two months prior to May 12, 2023. (Pet.,
Lopez Decl., ¶5 and Exh. 1.) A Notice of Abandonment of the Mobilehome was
posted on May 12, 2023. (Id. at Exh. 1.) The Notice of Belief of
Abandonment was also mailed by certified mail with return receipt requested to
the Mobilehome but no response has been made. (Proof of Service by Posting,
filed 01/08/24.) This evidence demonstrates that the Mobilehome is unoccupied
and a reasonable person would believe the Mobilehome to be abandoned.
Therefore, Petitioner has demonstrated that the Mobilehome is abandoned within
the meaning of Civil Code section 798.61, subdivision (a)(1).
 
B.         Notice of Belief of Abandonment—Civ.
Code § 798.61(b)
 
Civil Code, section
798.61, subdivision (b) requires: 
 
“After determining a mobilehome
in a mobilehome park to be an abandoned mobilehome, the management shall post a
notice of belief of abandonment on the mobilehome for not less than 30 days,
and shall deposit copies of the notice in the United States mail, postage
prepaid, addressed to the homeowner at the last known address and to any known
registered owner, if different from the homeowner, and to any known holder of a
security interest in the abandoned mobilehome. This notice shall be mailed by
registered or certified mail with a return receipt requested.”


(Civ. Code, § 798.61, subd. (b).) Petitioner attached a
Notice of the Belief of Abandonment to the Petition and demonstrates that it
was served on Respondents by posting and certified mail. (Pet., Lopez Decl.,
Exh. 1; Proof of Service by Posting, filed 01/08/24.) This satisfies the
requirements of Civil Code, section 798.61, subdivision (b).
 
C.        Petition for Judicial Declaration—Civ.
Code § 798.61(c)
 
Civ. Code § 798.61(c)(1) states:
 
“Thirty or more days following posting
pursuant to subdivision (b), the management may file a petition in the superior
court in the county in which the mobilehome park is located, for a judicial
declaration of abandonment of the mobilehome. A proceeding under this
subdivision is a limited civil case.  Copies
of the petition shall be served upon the homeowner, any known registered owner,
and any known person having a lien or security interest of record in the
mobilehome by posting a copy on the mobilehome and mailing copies to those
persons at their last known addresses by registered or certified mail with a
return receipt requested in the United States mail, postage prepaid.”  (Emphasis added.)
 
(Civ. Code, § 798.61, subd. (c)(1).) La Puente is located
within the County of Los Angeles, which is within this Court’s jurisdiction.
The Court further determines that the Petition was filed more than 30 days
after the Notice of Belief of Abandonment was posted. Additionally, the
Petition and Notice of Hearing were served on Respondents on November 3, 2023
by posting and certified mail with return receipt requested. (Proofs of Service
by Posting, filed 01/08/24.) 
 
D.        Charges, Attorneys’ Fees, and Costs
 
“If, at the hearing, the petitioner shows by a preponderance
of the evidence that the criteria for an abandoned mobilehome has been
satisfied and no party establishes an interest therein at the hearing and
tenders all past due rent and other charges, the court shall enter a judgment
of abandonment, determine the amount of charges to which the petitioner is
entitled, and award attorney's fees and costs to the petitioner.” (Civ. Code, §
798.61, subd. (d)(2).) Petitioner asks for accrued rent/storage fees on the
Space in the amount of $20,938.00 based on monthly rent of $1,102.00 per month
from July 1, 2022 through January 1, 2024. (Pet., Lopez Decl., ¶¶7-8 and Exh.
3.) No specific amount of costs or attorney’s fees are sought in the Petition,
however, the proposed default judgment seeks filing fees of $370.00.
Accordingly, costs of $370.00 are awarded.
