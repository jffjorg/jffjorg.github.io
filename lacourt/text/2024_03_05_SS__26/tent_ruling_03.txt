ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiff Zvard Artemyan (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action for holding security deposit, retaliation, breach of
contract, infliction of emotional distress, harassment, breach of implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and promissory estoppel against Defendants
Yervand Azizyan and Emilya Papoyan (“Defendants”) on December 20, 2021. The
matter was originally assigned to an unlimited jurisdiction court and set for
mandatory settlement conference on June 30, 2022. (Minute Order, 05/19/22.)
Following the mandatory settlement conference, the case did not settle and the
parties began to engage in discovery. (Minute Orders, 09/01/22 and 11/08/22.) 
 
At the case management conference
on May 24, 2023, the case was transferred to the limited jurisdiction court.
(Minute Order, 05/24/23.) Following transfer of the action, trial was set for
April 3, 2024. (Minute Order, 06/29/23.) On February 5, 2024, the parties filed
a stipulation to continue the trial date to May 23, 2024, which the Court
granted. (Stip and Order, filed 02/05/24.) 
 
Defendants filed the
instant Motion to Continue Trial on February 8, 2024. No opposition has been
filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
“Although continuances of
trials are disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its
own merits. The Court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of
good cause requiring the continuance.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, subd.
(c).) The Court may look to the following factors in determining whether a
trial continuance is warranted: (1) proximity of the trial date; (2) whether
there was any previous continuance of trial due to any party; (3) the length of
the continuance requested; (4) the availability of alternative means to address
the problem that gave rise to the motion; (5) the prejudice that parties or
witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance; and (6) whether trial
counsel is engaged in another trial. 
(See generally, Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, subd. (d)(1)-(11).)
Additionally, factors for the Court to consider include: a party’s excused
inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence
despite diligent efforts; whether all parties have stipulated to a continuance;
and any other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the
motion or application. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, subds. (c), (d).)
 
Defendants argue that good
cause exists for a continuance of the trial date, which is currently set for May
23, 2024, because additional discovery is required beyond what is permitted by
the limited jurisdiction court. (Motion, Lagstein Decl., ¶3.) Defendants also
intend to bring dispositive motions. (Ibid.) Plaintiff agreed to a
30-day continuance of the April 3, 2024 trial date to accommodate defense
counesl’s vacation plans but would not stipulate beyond that for litigation
purposes. (Id. at ¶5.) Finally, defense counsel has a medical condition
that will make trying any case in the next few months very difficult. (Id.
at ¶4.) These circumstances are reasonable grounds to continue the trial date. There
has only been one prior continuance and the trial date was only set at the end
of June 2023. Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the factors of Rule
3.1332 weigh in favor of the requested continuance of the trial date. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants Yervand
Azizyan and Emilya Papoyan’s Motion to Continue the Trial Date is GRANTED.
TRIAL IS CONTINUED TO NOVEMBER 22, 2024 AT 8:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE
SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. DISCOVERY AND MOTION CUTOFF DATES TO FOLLOW THE NEW
TRIAL DATE.
