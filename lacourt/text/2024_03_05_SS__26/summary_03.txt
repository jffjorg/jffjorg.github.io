And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion to continue the trial date. The trial was originally set for May 23, 2024, but the defendants argue that additional discovery is needed and they intend to bring dispositive motions. The court finds that the factors in Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332 weigh in favor of the requested continuance, including the proximity of the trial date, the lack of previous continuances, and the defendants' inability to obtain essential testimony and documents. The trial is continued to November 22, 2024, at 8:30 am in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
