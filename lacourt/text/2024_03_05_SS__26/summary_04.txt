Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the Petition to Declare Mobilehome Abandoned filed by Covina Hills MHC (the Petitioner) against Denise A. Daines, David A. Daines, and Lucy Daines (the Respondents). The Petitioner seeks a court order deeming the mobilehome located at 17350 E. Temple Ave Space 308, La Puente, California, to be abandoned, and awarding accrued rent due on the mobilehome site from July 1, 2022 to the present, as well as costs and attorney's fees.

The judge has found that the mobilehome is abandoned based on the criteria set forth in California Civil Code ยง 798.61, which requires that the mobilehome be located in a mobilehome park on a site for which no rent has been paid for the preceding 60 days, be unoccupied, and be not permanently affixed to the land. The Petitioner has provided evidence that the mobilehome has been unoccupied for at least two months prior to May 12, 2023, and that no rent has been paid for the Space since June 2022.

The judge has ordered that judgment be entered in favor of the Petitioner in the amount of $20,938.00 principal and $370.00 costs. The Petitioner has also been awarded attorney's fees and costs. The judge has set an order to show cause for the sale or disposal of the mobilehome and the submission of an accounting, to be heard on May 7, 2024.
