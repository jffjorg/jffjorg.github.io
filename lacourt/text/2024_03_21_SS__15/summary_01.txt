And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to requests for production of talc samples and documents from the defendant, Charles B. Chrystal Company. The motion was filed by the plaintiffs, Grace Schmidt and Anthony Schmidt.

The judge grants the request to compel the production of all samples of Osmanthus talc in the defendant's possession, as well as all samples of Osmanthus talc identified in an exhibit. However, the judge denies the request for all correspondence between RJ Lee and the defendant, as well as between RJ Lee and counsel, as the requests are overbroad and seek irrelevant information.

The judge also denies the request for sanctions, as the parties should have been able to work out the requests seeking the production of the talc samples, and the defendant's production of the samples in a different case does not necessitate their production in this case.

The judge orders the defendant to provide a verified amended response and produce the requested items within 20 days of the date of the order. The moving party is to give notice.
