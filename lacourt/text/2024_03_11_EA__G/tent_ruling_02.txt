 Case Number:  23PSCV00103    Hearing Date:   March 11, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Interior Wall Systems’s Motion for Attorney
Fees
Respondent: Defendant General
Motors, LLC
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Interior Wall Systems’s Motion for Attorney
Fees is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $31,420.00.
BACKGROUND
This
is a lemon law action. In July 2022, Plaintiff Interior Wall Systems (IWS)
entered into a warranty contract with Defendant General Motors, LLC (General
Motors) by purchasing a 2022 GMC Sierra 1500. Subsequently, IWS alleges the
vehicle developed defects with its check engine light, engine, ECM, and fuel
system.
On
January 12, 2023, IWS filed a complaint against General Motors and Does 1-10,
alleging a violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.
On
May 11, 2023, IWS filed a motion to compel the deposition of General Motors’
person most qualified. On June 8, the court granted IWS’s motion in part and
denied in part.
On
June 20, 2023, IWS filed a motion to compel further discovery responses. On
August 21, IWS filed a motion for sanctions that the court denied on October
17.
On
November 3, 2023, IWS filed a notice of settlement with General Motors. On
February 14, 2024, IWS filed a memorandum of costs. On February 15, IWS filed
the present motion. On February 26, General Motors filed a motion to strike or
tax IWS’s costs.
A
hearing on the present motion is set for March 11, 2024, along with an OSC Re:
Dismissal. General Motors’s motion to strike or tax costs is set for April 4.
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
IWS’s objections to the
declaration of General Motors’s counsel are SUSTAINED as to Nos. 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
ANALYSIS
IWS
moves the court for an award of reasonable attorney fees in the amount of $59,305.17.
For the following reasons, the court GRANTS IWS’s motion in the reduced amount
of $31,420.00.
Legal
Standard
Pursuant to the Song-Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act, a prevailing buyer “shall be allowed by the court to recover as
part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses,
including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined by the court
to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the
commencement and prosecution of such action.” (Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d).) They
have “the burden of showing that the fees incurred were reasonably necessary to
the conduct of the litigation, and were reasonable in amount.” (Robertson v.
Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785,
817.) In granting their motion, “[a] trial court may not rubber stamp a request
for attorney fees, but must determine the number of hours reasonably expended.”
(Morris v. Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 38 (Morris),
quoting Donahue v. Donahue (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 259, 271.) “If the
time expended or the monetary charge being made for the time expended are not
reasonable under all the circumstances, then the court must take this into
account and award attorney fees in a lesser amount.” (Nightingale v. Hyundai
Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.)
Calculation of attorney fees
begins with the lodestar approach in which the court fixes the lodestar at “the
number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.”
(Margolin v. Regional Planning Com. (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004,
quoting Copeland v. Marshall (D.C. Cir. 1980) 641 F.2d 880, 891.)
“California courts have consistently held that a computation of time spent on a
case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of
an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.” (Ibid.) “The lodestar figure may
then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in
order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided.”
(PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “The factors to be
considered include the nature and difficulty of the litigation, the amount of
money involved, the skill required and employed to handle the case, the
attention given, the success or failure, and other circumstances in the case.” (EnPalm,
LLC v. Teitler (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 770, 774.)
“It is appropriate for a
trial court to reduce a fee award based on its reasonable determination that a
routine, noncomplex case was overstaffed to a degree that significant
inefficiencies and inflated fees resulted.” (Morris, supra, 41
Cal.App.5th at p. 39.) It is also appropriate to reduce a fee award based on
“inefficient or duplicative efforts” in the billing record. (Id., at p.
38.) But the analysis must be “reasonably specific” and cannot rely on general
notions about the fairness of the fee award. (Kerkeles v. City of San Jose
(2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 88, 102.) And in conducting the analysis, courts are not
permitted to tie any reductions in the fee award to some proportion of the
buyer’s damages recovery. (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018) 30
Cal.App.5th 24, 39.)
Discussion
In this case, IWS argues they
are entitled to a total of $56,343.75 in attorney fees that includes $37,562.50
in fees and a multiplier of 1.5. In opposition, General Motors argues this case
does not warrant a multiplier and requests IWS’s fees be reduced to $15,959.00.
Prevailing Party
On November 3, 2023, IWS
filed a notice accepting General Motors’s offer to compromise pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 998 in which General Motors agreed to repurchase
IWS’s vehicle. Thus, IWS qualifies as the prevailing party in this action and
is entitled to attorney fees and costs.
Reasonableness of Hourly
Rate
In this case, IWS’s counsel have
hourly rates that range from $595 to $375 per hour. (Motion, p. 6:22-7:14; Kaufman
Decl., ¶ 6; Sanjur-Van Brande Decl., ¶ 9.) Counsel argue these rates are
reasonable and less than that of many plaintiff-side consumer protection
attorneys. (Kaufman Decl., ¶ 7; Sanjur-Van Brande Decl., ¶ 9, 12.) In
opposition, General Motors argues the median rate for attorneys handling vehicle
cases is $350 per hour pursuant to a 2023 attorney survey. But General Motors
fails to cite to a copy of this survey in their own evidence and instead cite
to a nonexistent exhibit in IWS’s evidence. (Opp., p. 10:3-6.)
To determine if an hourly
rate is reasonable, courts consider the rates of similar attorneys in the community
as well as “the experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting
fees.” (Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th
972, 1009.) Here, the declarations of Joseph A. Kaufman and Maria Sanjur-Van
Brande provide their experience (Kaufman Decl., ¶ 4-6; Sanjur-Van Brande Decl.,
¶ 7-8.), rates of other similar attorneys in the greater Los Angeles area
(Kaufman Decl., ¶ 12; Sanjur-Van Brande Decl., ¶ 12.), and other cases in which
a similar rate was approved by a court. (Kaufman Decl., ¶ 8; Sanjur-Van Brande
Decl., ¶ 10.) Based on this information, the court finds their hourly rates of
$595 and $375 reasonable.
With regards to IWS’s other
counsel, they failed to file similar declarations to support their requested
rates. Because the burden of establishing the reasonableness of attorney fees
is on IWS, the court declines to award any attorney fees incurred by these
other attorneys.
Reasonableness of Hours
Billed
IWS contends that the 98
hours spent by counsel in this action was reasonable. (Motion, p. 6:22-7:15.)
In opposition, General Motors contends that a total of 51.3 of the hours
incurred were not actually and reasonably incurred.
Although a verified fee bill
is “prima facie evidence the costs, expenses and services listed were
necessarily incurred,” (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677,
682), counsel still has the burden to demonstrate the reasonableness of
charges. (Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of North America, LLC (2020) 48
Cal.App.5th 240, 247.) The court has reviewed the fee bill submitted by IWS and
the proposed reductions by General Motors and addresses the parties’
contentions below.
IWS Counsel’s Initial
Work
General Motors argues the
court should decline to award fees for the 0.6 hours spent preparing an
engagement agreement by a legal assistant on January 9, 2023. General Motors
also argues the court should decline to award fees for 4.0 hours spent on file
review from January 10-11 and the 2.5 hours spent on file review on January 12.
With regards to the time
spent on the engagement agreement, General Motors argues this was a business
expense that is routinely treated as overhead and not separately billed to
either client or adversary. But General Motors cites no law or evidence to
support this contention.
As to the file review on
January 10-11, 2023, General Motors argues this was not necessary because it
was work more suited for a first-year associate than Kaufman and because it
appeared to be pre-engagement work. But the court fails to see how this
qualifies as pre-engagement work as it involved receiving and reviewing an
executed engagement agreement which necessarily implies that counsel had been
hired. The first two hours on January 10 also involved Kaufman meeting with the
client to discuss the next steps and preparing the case for assignment. The
next two hours on January 11 involved Kaufman conducting further investigation
and file review. While counsel for General Motors may have assigned this work
to an associate if they were the one working this case, Kaufman’s decision to
do the work was not unreasonable.
Last, on January 12, 2023, Sanjur-Van
Brande spent 2.5 hours conducting file review, preparing the complaint, and
communicating with the client. General Motors. While General Motors argues the
time should be reduced to 0.5 hours for the drafting of the complaint, General
Motors does not explicitly explain why the file review and client communications
should not count. To the extent General Motors is suggesting this is
duplicative of the earlier work done by Kaufman, the court disagrees. Accordingly,
the court declines to reduce or eliminate IWS’s requested fees on this issue.
Discovery
General Motors contends the
court should reduce fees awarded for IWS’s discovery requests, review of
General Motors’s discovery responses, discovery motion practice, and deposition
preparation.
IWS requests fees for 4.0
hours of preparing discovery requests for General Motors on February 9, 13, and
14. General Motors contends this request should be reduced by 3.5 hours because
IWS’s counsel utilized templates. Upon review of IWS’s discovery requests, the
court agrees with General Motors’ analysis. 
The discovery requests included a request for production of documents and
a notice of deposition, both of which appear to be standard Song-Beverly Act
discovery requests with minimal edits tailored to the subject vehicle. (Valencia
Decl., Ex. A, C.) Given the experience of counsel with lemon law cases, the
court finds a request of 4.0 hours is unjustified and reduces the time
requested to 1.0 hour. Because work on the motions was split between Sanjur-Van
Brande and a paralegal, the court awards fees for 0.5 hours at Sanjur-Van
Brande’s rate and 0.5 hours at the paralegal’s rate of $175 per hour.
IWS also requests fees for
4.9 hours of reviewing General Motors’s discovery responses on May 3 and 4.
General Motors contends this request should be reduced by 4.4 hours because General
Motors’s responses were not novel or significantly different from previous
responses. But General Motors failed to provide any copies or specific
descriptions of its responses for the court to determine if it was reasonable
for counsel to spend 4.9 hours reviewing the responses. Because the court does
not find this request to be unreasonable on its face, the court declines to
reduce IWS’s requested fees as to this issue.
IWS requests fees for
discovery motion practice which include a motion to compel deposition, motion
to compel further requests for production, and a motion for terminating
sanctions. With regard to the motion to compel deposition, General Motors
contends the court should deny attorney fees for this motion as it was
avoidable and unnecessary. But in granting IWS’s motion in part, the court
specifically found that General Motors failed to agree on dates for a
deposition despite agreeing to provide a person most qualified. (7/8/2023
Ruling, p. 2.) Thus, IWS’s motion was not in fact avoidable.  Therefore, the court grants IWS’s request for
attorney fees spent on this motion.
As to the motion to compel
further requests for production, General Motors contends that the court should reduce
IWS’s request from 4.2 hours to 1.0 hour. The court agrees this discovery
motion appears to be a boilerplate lemon law discovery motion and accordingly
reduces the time requested to 2.0 hours. Last, with regards to the motion for
terminating sanctions, General Motors contends that the court should deny
attorney fees for this motion because it was an attempt to inflate the attorney
fees for the deposition at issue. In denying IWS’s motion, the court specifically
noted the request for terminating sanctions was inappropriate as IWS sought the
harshest discovery sanction available without first attempting to compel
answers or seeking lesser sanctions. (10/17/2023 Ruling, p. 2.) For the same
reasons, the court finds this motion was not a necessary or reasonable expense.
Thus, the court declines to award any attorney fees incurred in the drafting of
this motion.
Last, IWS requests 3.7 hours
for deposition preparation on August 17 and 4.2 hours for the file review,
preparation, and the actual deposition on September 5. While General Motors
admits 3.7 hours could be reasonable for deposition preparation, General Motors
contends it is unreasonable for an attorney who bills $375 per hour and
requests a reduction to 1.0 hour of deposition preparation. But in light of
Sanjur-Van Brande’s two years of experience in handing lemon law cases, the
court does not find this to be an unreasonable amount of time. With regards to
the 4.2 hours spent on September 5, General Motors contends that the court
should deny this request because it is impossible for General Motors to tell
how much time was spent on the deposition itself. The court does not find this argument
persuasive as General Motors is aware of how much approximate time their person
most qualified sat for deposition. Thus, the court grants IWS’s request for
attorney fees on this issue.
Client Communications
General Motors maintains that
counsel’s billing of 3.6 hours of client communication over nine separate
entries is wholly unnecessary and requests the court reduce the amount to 0.4
hours. But the court finds 3.6 hours of client communication during the year is
far from unreasonable. Thus, the court declines to adopt General Motors’s
requested reduction.
Vehicle Surrender
General Motors argues
counsel’s billing of 3.8 hours for tasks related to the surrender of IWS’s
vehicle on December 28 and January 9, 12, 16, and 17 were unexplained and
unjustified. On December 28, Sanjur-Van Brande spent 0.2 hours discussing the
status of the vehicle surrender appointment with IWS while Kaufman spent 0.4
hours reviewing the file status of the case and correspondence form General
Motors regarding the vehicle surrender. On January 9, Sanjur-Van Brande spent
0.2 hours on communicating with IWS regarding the status of the surrender
appointment. On January 12, Sanjur-Van Brande spent 0.1 hours sending
correspondence to General Motors regarding status of the vehicle surrender, 0.1
hours communicating with IWS, 0.5 hours reviewing response from General Motors
and communicating information to IWS, and 0.8 hours drafting detailed
correspondence to client and “TC” regarding coordination of the vehicle
surrender. On January 16, Sanjur-Van Brande spent 1.0 hour coordinating the
vehicle surrender with multiple phone calls to those involved and
correspondence to the client. On January 17, Sanjur-Van Brande spent 0.1 hours
receiving signed copies of the transfer document from the client and 0.2 hours
corresponding with General Motors regarding an issue with the DMV form and
status of settlement funds. Kaufman also spent 0.3 hours corresponding with
FedEx regarding vehicle surrender issues while their paralegal spent 0.5 hours
receiving and forwarding surrendering docs from client to opposing counsel.
Contrary to General Motors’s
assertion, the court finds these billing records are explained in detail and
appear justified on their face. General Motors failed to provide any evidence
otherwise that would establish that they were not proper. Thus, the court
declines to adopt General Motors’s requested reduction on this issue.
Fees for the Present
Motion
General Motors contends
counsel’s billing of 4.1 hours for the drafting of the present motion is excessive
and requests a reduction to 1.0 hour. While the court agrees 4.1 hours is
excessive for the drafting the present motion, the court will reduce the time
to 1.5 hours of drafting for Sanjur-Van Brande and 0.5 hours of drafting for
Kaufman.
Reasonableness of
Multiplier
IWS maintains it is entitled
to a 1.5 multiplier based on the favorable case resolution and contingent risks
inherent in pursuing this case. The factors which courts look at to determine
if a multiplier is reasonable are: “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the
questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent
to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v.
Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132).
With regards to the first
factor, IWS fails to address how the present action involves novel and
difficult questions. Instead, this action appears to be a standard lemon law
case where IWS asserted a single cause of action for violation of the
Song-Beverly Act. Thus, the first factor does not weigh in favor of awarding a
multiplier.
As to the second factor, IWS’s
counsel claim they “obtained an excellent result that most lawyers would be
unable to obtain, including a judgment and a civil penalty.” (Motion, p. 10:20-28.)
But IWS’s counsel failed to provide any evidence to substantiate the claim that
the outcome here was so novel or difficult. While the court is confident IWS’s
counsel are skilled lemon law practitioners, the court fails to see how this
case involved an exceptional outcome that justifies a multiplier.
With regards to the third
factor, IWS’s counsel assert the time spent on this case meant they could not
represent other clients during that time. (Kaufman Decl., ¶ 10; Sanjur-Van
Brande Decl., ¶ 11.) But this claim is directly contradicted by the court’s own
records of which it may properly take judicial notice pursuant to Evidence Code
section 452, subdivision (d). They demonstrate that both counsel filed at least
five additional lemon law actions on the behalf of separate plaintiffs in the
same court during the month of January 2023 after they filed the present
action.[1] They
also demonstrate that Sanjur-Van Brande served as counsel of record in these
cases until the cases were voluntarily dismissed in a period ranging from
August 2023 to January 2024. Thus, this third factor also weighs against
awarding a multiplier given counsel’s representation here appears to have
little to no effect on their ability to conterminously represent multiple
plaintiffs in similar actions.
Last, IWS’s counsel claim
they are entitled to a multiplier based on the contingent risks in this case. But
even so, the weight of every other factor against them suggests the application
of a multiplier would be inappropriate in this case. Accordingly, the court
declines to award a multiplier.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, IWS’s
motion for attorney fees is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $31,420.00 based
upon the adjustments and reductions noted below.
