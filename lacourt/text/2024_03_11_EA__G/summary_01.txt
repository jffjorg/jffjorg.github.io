And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This is a disability rights action brought by plaintiff Rebecca Castillo, who is visually impaired and legally blind. Castillo alleges that defendant Hotties International LLC's commercial website contains accessibility barriers that prevent her from accessing the website. Despite serving Hotties with substitute service, the defendant failed to respond to the complaint. Castillo has therefore filed an application for default judgment, seeking damages, attorney fees, and costs. The court finds that Castillo has submitted sufficient evidence to support her claims and grants her application for default judgment. Specifically, the court awards Castillo $8,000 in damages, $570 in attorney fees, and $504 in costs. The court also awards $4,000 in deterrence damages, finding that Castillo was deterred from visiting Hotties' physical store location due to the website's accessibility barriers.
