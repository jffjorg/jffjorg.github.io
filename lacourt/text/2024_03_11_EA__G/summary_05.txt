And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Maserati North America, Inc. (Maserati) to the complaint filed by Heqian Zhang (Plaintiff). The demurrer challenges the Plaintiff's fifth cause of action for violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200. The judge finds that Maserati's counsel did not adequately meet and confer with the Plaintiff's counsel before filing the demurrer, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41. As a result, the judge has continued the hearing on the demurrer to a date to be determined and ordered Maserati's counsel to meet and confer with the Plaintiff's counsel regarding the demurrer and file a supplemental declaration describing the meet and confer efforts at least nine court days before the next scheduled hearing on the demurrer.
