  Case Number:  22PSCV02866    Hearing Date:   March 11, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Rebecca
Castillo’s Application for Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Rebecca
Castillo’s Application for Default Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a disability rights action. Plaintiff Rebecca Castillo is a visually
impaired and legally blind individual. Defendant Hotties International LLC
(Hotties) is a California limited liability company that operates a commercial
website available to the public.
As
early as October 2022, Castillo visited Hotties’s website multiple times and
alleges the following barriers to access existed: (1) graphics, links, and
buttons on the website were mislabeled or lacked alternative text (alt-text)
for screen-reading software to read out; (2) multiple pages contained insufficient
navigational headings; (3) menu links and descriptions were inaccessible to
screen reading technology, and (4) the checkout system for pickup orders was
inaccessible.
On December
13, 2022, Castillo filed a complaint for damages and injunctive relief against Hotties
and Does 1-10, alleging violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (UCRA).
On
September 28, 2023, Castillo filed a
First Amended Complaint (FAC) against the same defendants alleging the same
causes of action. On October 5, Castillo’s process server served Hotties with
substitute service in Garden Grove.
On December
18, 2023, default was entered against Hotties. On February 13, 2024, Castillo
submitted the present application for default judgment.
An
OSC Re: Default Judgment is set for March 11, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Castillo
seeks default judgment against Hotties in the total amount of $9,074, including
$8,000 in damages ($4,000 in statutory damages and $4,000 in deterrence damages),
$570 in attorney fees, and $504 in costs. Because the court finds Castillo has
submitted sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS Castillo’s application
for default judgment.  
As to
the court’s analysis regarding the award of deterrence damages, Castillo alleges that
Castillo was deterred from visiting Hotties’s physical store location in Chino
Hills after encountering website accessibility barriers on October 2, 2022.
(Castillo Decl., ¶ 3, 6.) Castillo stated Castillo faced the same barriers when
Castillo attempted to place an order on September 15, 2023. (Castillo Decl., ¶
5-6.) Because Castillo claimed one instance of deterrence in October 2022 and
one instance of encountering barriers in September 2023, the court finds
Castillo  adequately established grounds
for deterrence damages in the requested amount of $4,000.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Castillo’s
application for default judgment is GRANTED.
