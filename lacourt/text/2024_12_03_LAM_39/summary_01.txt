And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to stay the action brought by plaintiff George Stanley Donev against defendant Jared Smith. The stay is based on a restraining order obtained by Donev against Smith in a separate domestic violence case, which prohibits Smith from contacting Donev directly or indirectly. The judge finds that it would be impractical for the two self-represented litigants to participate in the action while the restraining order is in place, and that the order has not been modified to permit them to communicate or interact with each other. The judge schedules an order to show cause regarding the status of the restraining order on April 26, 2025, and places all other motions off calendar.
