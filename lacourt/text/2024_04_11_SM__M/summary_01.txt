English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion for summary adjudication on the issue of non-economic damages. The Plaintiff was the operator and owner of a vehicle involved in an accident, but did not have insurance coverage at the time of the accident. The Plaintiff's sister was the registered owner of the vehicle, and the Plaintiff had a suspended driver's license. The Judge ruled that the Plaintiff cannot recover non-economic damages because he did not have financial responsibility as required by California Civil Code section 3333.4. The Plaintiff had not disclosed the true facts of insurance coverage, and the insurance company, Allstate, cancelled the policy due to excessive permissive use. The Judge ruled that the Plaintiff was not a named insured under the insurance policy, and therefore, cannot recover non-economic damages.
