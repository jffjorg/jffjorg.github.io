to Quash Service of Summons

Legal
Standard
 

“A defendant . . . may serve and file a notice of
motion for one or more of the following purposes:  (1) To quash service of summons on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction of the court over him or her. . . .” (CCP § 418.10(a).) A court lacks
jurisdiction over a party if there has not been proper service of
process. (Ruttenberg v. Ruttenberg (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 801, 808.)
“When a motion to quash is properly brought,
the burden of proof is placed upon the plaintiff to establish the facts of
jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.” (Aquila, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 556, 568.)  The plaintiff has “the burden of proving the facts that did
give the court jurisdiction, that is the facts requisite to an effective
service.”  (Coulston v. Cooper (1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 866, 868.)
 
“[C]ompliance with the statutory procedures for service of
process is essential to establish personal jurisdiction. [Citation.]” (Dill
v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444.) “[T]he
filing of a proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that the service
was proper” but only if it “complies with the statutory requirements regarding
such proofs.” (Id. at 1441-1442.) 
 
To effectuate service on a corporation, summons may be
delivered to the agent for service of process or to the president, chief
executive officer, or other head of the corporation, a vice president, a
secretary or assistant secretary, a treasurer or assistant treasurer, a
controller or chief financial officer, a general manager, or a person
authorized by the corporation to receive service of process. (CCP, § 416.10(a),
(b).)
 
Analysis
 
Defendant moves to quash service of
summons because 1) Plaintiff failed to serve a person specified in Code of
Civil Procedure section 416.10; and 2) Plaintiff did not mail the summons to a
person specified in section 416.10 following substitute service. 
 
            The proof
of service on file states that on March 14, 2024, a registered process server
served copies of the summons and complaint on Defendant through their
authorized agent for service of process, Angela Kimbrough, via substituted
service at Defendant’s place of business during normal business hours on Jane
Doe, the person apparently in charge of the office. Thereafter, the process
server mailed by first-class, postage prepaid, copies of the documents as
follows: “Beverly Hills Investors, Inc. - Angela Kimbrough - Authorized Agent
for Service of Process [¶] 441 S. Beverly Drive, Unit 5 Beverly Hills, CA
90212.” This service facially meets the requirements of CCP §416.10 and the
mailing requirement for substitute service.
 
Defendant contends that the service
was ineffective because the process server gave the documents to Ms. Bruce, the
person apparently in charge of the office. Defendant implies that for effective
service, the process server would have to physically hand the documents to Ms.
Kimbrough. Defendant cites no authority for this proposition. Unlike the
caselaw cited, the packet was addressed to the correct person to be served, Ms.
Kimbrough. (See Ramos v. Homeward Residential, Inc. (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 1434, 1437-42 [where the proof of service
fails to identify any such person, the proof of service is defective].) As
noted, service on a corporation may be achieved by substitute service. (CCP §
415.20(a); Khourie, Crew & Jaeger v. Sabek, Inc. (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d
1009, 1015 [service effected by leaving summons and complaint outside the door
and mailing a copy of the summons and complaint].) Here, it is undisputed that
Plaintiff’s process server left a copy of the summons and complaint at
Defendant/Ms. Kimbrough’s place of business during usual office hours, with the
person “apparently in charge thereof.” (CCP § 415.20(a).) Defendant does not
show that Ms. Bruce was not “apparently” in charge of the office. Ms. Bruce
only contends that she was not authorized to receive the service (but is
authorized to receive and handle Defendant’s mail). (Bruce Decl., ¶¶ 3, 5.) 
 
In reply, Defendant contends that
there were no reasonable efforts to personally serve Ms. Kimbrough or other
persons to be served. However, there is no reasonable diligence requirements
for service on an entity such as a corporation. (CCP § 415.20(a).) 
 
Finally, Defendant states that as
of March 19, 2024, they still have not received the mailed copy. (Bruce Decl.,
¶5.) This self-serving declaration, however, is insufficient to rebut the
process server’s verified mailing, especially since service was only a few days
prior.
 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.  A responsive pleading is ordered within five
days.
