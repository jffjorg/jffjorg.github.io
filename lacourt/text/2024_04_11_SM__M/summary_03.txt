English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to quash service of summons filed by Beverly Hills Investors Inc. (Defendant) against Armon Funding LLC (Plaintiff). The Defendant argues that the service of process was ineffective because the process server did not physically hand the documents to Angela Kimbrough, the authorized agent for service of process. The Judge, however, finds that the service was effective, citing the proof of service and the fact that the process server left a copy of the summons and complaint at Defendant's place of business during usual office hours. The Judge also notes that Defendant's contention that the process server did not make reasonable efforts to personally serve Ms. Kimbrough or other persons to be served is unfounded. The motion to quash service of summons is denied, and a responsive pleading is ordered within five days.
