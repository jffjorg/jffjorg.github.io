MOTION:                  Motion
for Summary Adjudication
HEARING DATE:   4/11/2024

 
Legal
Standard
 
            A party may move for summary
judgment in any action or proceeding if it is contended the action has no merit
or that there is no defense to the action or proceeding. (CCP, § 437c(a).) “The
purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to
cut through the parties' pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) 
 
“A party may move for summary adjudication as
to one or more causes of action within an action, one or more affirmative defenses,
one or more claims for damages, or one or more issues of duty, if the party
contends that the cause of action has no merit, that there is no affirmative
defense to the cause of action, that there is no merit to an affirmative
defense as to any cause of action, that there is no merit to a claim for
damages, as specified in Section 3294 of the Civil Code, or that one or
more defendants either owed or did not owe a duty to the plaintiff or
plaintiffs.” (CCP, § 437c(f)(1).) If a party seeks summary adjudication
as an alternative to a request for summary judgment, the request must be
clearly made in the notice of the motion. (Gonzales v. Superior Court (1987)
189 Cal.App.3d 1542, 1544.)  “[A] party may move for summary adjudication
of a legal issue or a claim for damages other than punitive damages that does
not completely dispose of a cause of action, affirmative defense, or issue
of duty pursuant to” subdivision (t). (CCP, § 437c(t).) 
 
            To
prevail, the evidence submitted must show there is no triable issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of
law. (CCP, § 437c(c).) The motion cannot succeed unless the
evidence leaves no room for conflicting inferences as to material facts; the
court has no power to weigh one inference against another or against other
evidence. (Murillo v. Rite Stuff Food Inc. (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th
833, 841.) In determining whether the facts give rise to a triable issue of
material fact, “[a]ll doubts as to whether any material, triable, issues of
fact exist are to be resolved in favor of the party opposing summary judgment…”
(Gold v. Weissman (2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1195, 1198-99.) “In other
words, the facts alleged in the evidence of the party opposing summary judgment
and the reasonable inferences there from must be accepted as true.” (Jackson
v. County of Los Angeles (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 171, 179.) However, if
adjudication is otherwise proper the motion “may not be denied on grounds of
credibility,” except when a material fact is the witness’s state of
mind and “that fact is sought to be established solely by the [witness’s]
affirmation thereof.” (CCP, § 437c(e).) 
 
            Once
the moving party has met their burden, the burden shifts to the opposing party
“to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that
cause of action or a defense thereto.” (CCP § 437c(p)(1).) “[T]here is no obligation on the opposing party... to establish
anything by affidavit unless and until the moving party has by affidavit stated
facts establishing every element... necessary to sustain a judgment in his
favor.” (Consumer Cause, Inc. v. SmileCare (2001) 91
Cal.App.4th 454, 468.) 
 
“The pleadings play a key role in a summary
judgment motion. The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment
is to delimit the scope of the issues and to frame the outer measure
of materiality in a summary judgment proceeding.” (Hutton v. Fidelity
National Title Co. (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 486, 493, quotations
and citations omitted.) “Accordingly, the burden of a defendant moving for
summary judgment only requires that he or she negate plaintiff's theories of
liability as alleged in the complaint; that is, a moving party need
not refute liability on some theoretical possibility not included in the
pleadings.” (Ibid.) 
 
EVIDENTIARY ISSUES
 
Defendants’ objections to the Hakim declaration are
SUSTAINED.
 
Analysis
 
Defendants
Kasra Mizban (“Kasra”) and Nasser Mizban (“Nasser”) move for adjudication of
two issues: 1) Plaintiff is not entitled to recover non-economic damages
to compensate for pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment,
disfigurement, and other nonpecuniary damages pursuant to Civil Code section
3333.4 because Plaintiff was the operator of the vehicle involved in the
accident and Plaintiff cannot establish his financial responsibility as required
by the financial responsibility laws of the State of California; and 2) Defendants’
Eleventh Affirmative Defense is summarily adjudicated in favor of Defendants
and Plaintiff’s damages are limited to economic damages pursuant to Civil Code
section 3333.4.
 
Strictly speaking, the first issue
is not ripe for adjudication because it does not dispose of the entirety of a
cause of action, defense, claim of punitive damages, or issue of duty. Thus,
the Court is not inclined to grant the motion as to the first issue. That said,
Civil Code section 3333.4’s bar on noneconomic damages is properly raised as an
affirmative defense. (See Chude v. Jack in the Box Inc. (2010) 185
Cal.App.4th 37 [trial court properly adjudicated restaurant’s affirmative
defense based on section 3333.4, where an uninsured driver suffered severe
burns when she spilled coffee she had ordered at the drive-through window of a
fast-food restaurant]; see also Hodges v. Superior Court (1999) 21
Cal.4th 109, 112, fn. 1 [manufacturer subsequently amended its answer to action
by uninsured motorist to assert as a separate affirmative defense that the
motorist was precluded from recovering noneconomic damages under section 3333.4,
noting that section 437c(f)(1) permits a party to move for summary adjudication
as to “one or more affirmative defenses”].) The Court will therefore focus on
the second issue, which targets an entire defense.
 
Civil Code section 3333.4 provides in
pertinent part: “in any action to recover damages arising out of the operation
or use of a motor vehicle, a person shall not recover non-economic losses to
compensate for pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment,
disfigurement, and other nonpecuniary damages if any of the following applies…
(2) The injured person was the owner of a vehicle involved in the accident and
the vehicle was not insured as required by the financial responsibility laws of
this state. [¶] (3) The injured person was the operator of a vehicle involved
in the accident and the operator cannot establish his or her financial
responsibility as required by the financial responsibility laws of this state.”
(Civ. Code, § 3333.4 (a)(2), (3).)
 
The general purpose of Civil Code
section 3333.4 is to restrict the ability of certain categories of individuals,
including uninsured motorists, convicted drunk drivers, and felons, from
recovering for losses suffered in automobile accidents. (Allen v.
Sully-Miller Contracting Co. (2002) 28 Cal.4th 222, 225.) The statute also
sought to incentivize individuals to purchase automobile insurance by
penalizing uninsured drivers. (Landeros v. Torres (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th
398, 415-416.) By encouraging uninsured drivers to buy auto insurance, the hope
was that law-abiding citizens would no longer be obligated “to carry the burden
of paying for those citizens that choose to directly defy the current state of
the law.” (Yoshioka v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 972, 991.)
 
Defendant presents the following
material facts. Plaintiff seeks damages for personal injuries he sustained in a
car accident on October 6, 2019, including non-economic losses. (UMF 1, 16-17.)
On October 6, 2019, Plaintiff was the driver and operator of a black 2004 Chevy
Silverado with California license plate number 62293J1 (the “Chevy”). (UMF 2.)
Although the registered owner of the Chevy was Plaintiff’s sister, Veronica
Garcia, who lived more than 100 miles away, Plaintiff had been solely and exclusively
driving the Chevy for more than ten months prior to the accident, and
Plaintiff’s complaint further pleads that he was “at all times relevant herein”
both the “driver” and the “owner” of the Chevy. (UMF 3-10.) Plaintiff alleges
that on October 6, 2019, Kasra rear ended Plaintiff’s Chevy with Nasser’s
Honda. (UMF 11.) It is undisputed that, despite Plaintiff’s discovery responses
to the contrary, Plaintiff’s driver’s license was suspended at the time of the
collision. (UMF 15, 20-37.)
 
Critical to this motion, Plaintiff
did not have any insurance policy in his own name or which identified him as an
insured. (UMF 37-40.) Specifically, on October 6, 2019, Plaintiff did not have
any policy of insurance in place of his own that identified him as a named
insured and owner of the Chevy. (Kang Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. C [Plaintiff’s depo at
pp. 88:19-23, 126:9-127:5]; Ex. E [Plaintiff’s Response to FROG 4.1].) Plaintiff
did not have non-owner automobile insurance in his own name at the time of the October
6, 2019, accident. (Ibid.) Plaintiff was not self-insured under any statute for
any of the damages, claims, or actions that have arisen out of the incident. (Id.,
Ex. E [FROG no. 4.2].)
 
At the time of the incident, Veronica
Garcia, Plaintiff’s sister and the registered owner of the Chevy, resided
approximately 163 miles away from Plaintiff, in Riverside County, at 99145
Lookout Dr., Mecca, California. (UMF 42.) Sometime prior to January 2019,
Plaintiff asked Garcia to use the Chevy to “get around.” (UMF 47.) Garcia gave
him the vehicle for his regular use even though he had a suspended license.
(UMF 48.) For the next ten months before the accident, Plaintiff testified and
alleges that he was the sole and exclusive driver of the Chevy. (UMF 2-10,
47-48.) Plaintiff contends that he was insured under an Auto Policy from
Allstate Insurance Company/Allstate Northbrook Indemnity Company (“Allstate”),
policy number 967 080 728 (the “Policy”), issued to named insured and
policyholder Garcia. (UMF 54.) Garcia originally obtained the Policy from
Allstate in 2017, and then renewed it several times, including for the policy
period in question, namely May 20, 2019, to November 20, 2019. (UMF 55-56.) In
March 2019, before the Policy was renewed, Allstate sent Garcia an invoice and
renewal auto policy declarations page (“Declaration”) at her address, showing
how the premium for the Chevy had been calculated and the facts on which that
premium was based. (UMF 57.) The declaration shows the only named insured and
listed driver was Garcia. (UMF 58.) Garcia did not tell Allstate that this was
untrue because only Plaintiff was driving the Chevy at that time. (UMF 59.) The
premiums were based on Garcia’s driving record. (UMF 60-61.) The Chevy was
listed as “driven for pleasure, rated as an extra vehicle with no assigned
operator.” (UMF 62.) Garcia did not tell Allstate that she was no longer
driving the vehicle or that Plaintiff was exclusively using the vehicle. (UMF
63-64.) The underwriting criteria assumed that it was garaged and located at
that address, in Riverside County, California. (UMF 65.) Garcia did not add her
brother as a driver or otherwise correct this information, in breach of her
insurance agreement. (UMF 68-70, 82.) 
 
The Policy provisions provided
certain coverages to “insured persons” which did not include Plaintiff as a
spouse or domestic partner. (UMF 74-80.) The policy expressly denies coverage
where there is fraud, defined as follows: “Fraud [¶] This policy will
not apply to any claim in which an insured person has concealed or
misrepresented any material fact or circumstance.” (UMF 81.) The policy further
provides that “Allstate will not pay for those damages which an insured person
is legally obligated to pay because of: bodily injury or property damage which
may reasonably be expected to result from the intentional or criminal acts of
the insured person or which are in fact intended by the insured person.” (UMF 83.)
 
It is undisputed that no money was
paid out for any claim on this Allstate policy concerning the subject
collision. (UMF 84-85.) Allstate determined that the terms of the Policy had
been violated due to “excessive permissive use” of the vehicle by Plaintiff.
(UMF 86.) The next policy issued by Allstate expressly excluded Plaintiff as a
driver. (UMF 88.)  
 
            The above
evidence meets Defendants’ burden of production on this issue. Defendants’
evidence shows Plaintiff did not independently have insurance (UMF 37-40) and
was covered by the owner’s insurance (UMF 42-83). Therefore, Plaintiff “was the
operator of a vehicle involved in the accident” that cannot establish his
“financial responsibility” at the time as required by state law. (Civ. Code
§3333.4(a)(3).) 
 
Plaintiff opposes and contends that
there is a dispute of fact as to whether Plaintiff had insurance coverage
during the incident. Plaintiff only cites one piece of evidence – that the
Chevy was insured under the Allstate policy at the time of the subject
incident. Of course, this brings nothing new to the record. Despite the Chevy
being insured by the owner, Plaintiff was not the owner and illegally operated
the Chevy in violation of the express policy terms. Plaintiff otherwise contends
that there is no evidence showing he wasn’t covered as a “permissive”
driver under Allstate Ins. Policy no. 967 080 728 at the time of the incident. At
face value, this does not present any dispute of fact and simply ignores the
evidence demonstrating that he was not a named insured or otherwise covered
under the Allstate policy. (UMF 86.) Plaintiff purports to dispute UMF 86, but
does not cite any evidence in support of the dispute. At best, Plaintiff cites
the speculation of his counsel on the absence of evidence of a coverage denial.
(Hakim Decl., ¶ 5.) This is not evidence of financial responsibility under
section 3333.4.
 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED
as to issue no. 2 only.
