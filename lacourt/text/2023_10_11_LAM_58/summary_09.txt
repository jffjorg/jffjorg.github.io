Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the plaintiffs' claims under the Song-Beverly Act and has sustained the defendant's demurrer in its entirety. The plaintiffs have alleged violations of the Song-Beverly Act and breach of express and implied warranties, but the judge has determined that their claims are uncertain and fail to state a cause of action. The judge has also determined that the plaintiffs' amended complaint does not comply with the court's previous ruling, and therefore the motion to strike is moot. The plaintiffs have leave to amend their complaint, which must be served and filed on or before November 10, 2023.
