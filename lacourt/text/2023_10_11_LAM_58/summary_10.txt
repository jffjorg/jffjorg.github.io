And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by the Judge in the case of Knox v. KIA. The case concerns a dispute over the Song-Beverly Act, which regulates the sale of goods in California. The Judge is considering the defendant's demurrer, which argues that the complaint is uncertain and unintelligible. The Judge finds that the demurrer may be sustained on either ground, and that the fact that the defendant believes the complaint is both uncertain and unintelligible does not impose a new requirement that it must be both.

The Judge also considers the meaning of section 1793.22, subdivision (e)(2) of the California Civil Code, which defines what constitutes a "new motor vehicle" for purposes of the Song-Beverly Act. The Judge finds that the text of the statute is obscure and has yielded contrary appellate interpretations, and that the matter may soon be clarified by the California Supreme Court.

The Judge's tentative ruling seeks to harmonize the two precedents in the case, finding that the buyer's decision to purchase the vehicle after leasing may have a bearing on the damages recoverable under the relevant statutes.
