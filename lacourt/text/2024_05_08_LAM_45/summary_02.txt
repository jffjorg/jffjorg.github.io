And here is the summary in English:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge MEL RED RECANA in a lawsuit between FIRE GUARD CORPORATION dba BUILTRIGHT ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION (the plaintiff) and STANFORD AND 12TH STREET, LP, et al. (the defendants). The plaintiff filed a complaint alleging breaches of contract, open book account, account stated, quantum meruit, and foreclosure of mechanic's lien. The defendants filed a cross-complaint alleging implied contractual indemnity, expressed contractual indemnity, breach of lease, breach of guaranty, and account stated.

The moving party, Mayer Separzadeh, filed two unopposed motions to compel responses to discovery requests. The court granted the motions and ordered the defendants to provide verified, complete, and code-compliant responses to the discovery requests. The court also awarded monetary sanctions in the amount of $810.00 to compensate the moving party for his time and expenses.

The lawsuit arose from an alleged failure to pay monies owed pursuant to a contract for renovating a property.
