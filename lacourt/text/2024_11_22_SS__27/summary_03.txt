And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena served on Michi Floor Co. for production of employment records. The subpoena was served on August 21, 2024, and the deadline for production was September 9, 2024. Despite multiple meet-and-confer attempts, Michi Floor Co. failed to produce the requested documents. The Court finds good cause to compel production of the employment records because there is a significant discrepancy between the Plaintiff's claim for lost wages and the income reflected in the limited documents produced. The Court also notes that the Defendant satisfied the meet-and-confer requirement and provided proper notice of the motion to all parties and the deponent. As a result, Michi Floor Co. is ordered to comply with the subpoena and produce the requested employment records within 15 days of this Order.
