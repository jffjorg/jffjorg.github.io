And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and against the plaintiff, Sahman, in a case involving a claim for damages against the City of Los Angeles due to an alleged injury from a cracked sidewalk. Sahman alleges that he did not timely present a claim under Government Code §945.4 within six months of the accident, despite admitting to not doing so. He filed a late application on October 20, 2023, six months after filing the complaint, and argued that the untimeliness should be excused due to excusable attorney neglect by his prior attorney, Harris. The judge has ruled that excusable attorney neglect is not a valid reason to excuse the failure to comply with the statute of limitations, and that the one-year deadline for filing a late claim under Government Code §911.4 is a jurisdictional statute of limitations that cannot be waived. As a result, the judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, effectively dismissing the case.
