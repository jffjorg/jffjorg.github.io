Sahman v. City of
Los Angeles et al., Case No. 23SMCV01701
Hearing Date
November 16, 2023 
Defendant Los
Angeles Unified School District’s Demurrer to FAC
Plaintiff Sahman’s
Petition for Order Relieving Petitioner from Government Code §945.4 
 
Plaintiff Sahman alleges
injuries after falling from his bike due to a crack in defendant City’s sidewalk.
Defendant LAUSD demurs, arguing Sahman did not comply with the government tort
claims act.
 
Cal. Gov. Code
§945.4 states “any party with a claim for damages against a public entity must
first present the claim to the entity; only if the claim is denied or rejected
may the claimant then institute civil litigation.” The claim must be presented
no later than six months after the accrual of the claim, i.e. the date the
statute of limitations would begin to run. Gov. Code §§ 901, 9112. 
 
If plaintiff fails
to present a claim within six months, they may apply for leave to present a late
claim “within a reasonable time not to exceed one year after the accrual of the
cause of action.” Cal. Gov. Code §911.4(b). Failure to timely present a
government claim bars plaintiff from filing a lawsuit. City of Stockton v.
Superior Court (2007) 42 Cal. 4th 730, 737-738. The one-year deadline in
§911.4 functions as a “statute of limitations” on claims against government
entities. Hom v. Chico Unified School Dist. (1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 335. 
 
The accident
occurred April 23, 2021; the complaint was filed April 20, 2023. Defendant
LAUSD demurs, arguing plaintiff did not timely present a claim nor file an application
for leave to present a late claim.
 
Sahman admits he
did not timely present a §945.4 claim or §911.4 application. He filed an
untimely application on October 20, 2023, six months after filing the complaint.
Sahman argues this late application should be accepted, and its untimeliness
excused for excusable attorney neglect under Code of Civ. Proc. §473(b). Plaintiff’s
counsel Waterman states Sahman’s now-deceased prior attorney Harris, was suffering
from undiagnosed tumors, which damaged his mental capacity and caused him to
forget to file the application. Waterman decl. ¶¶7-11. 
 
Cal. Code of Civ.
Proc. §473(b), which allows for relief from a “judgment, dismissal, order or
other proceeding” resulting from “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect,” or attorney error, cannot be used to circumvent the statute of
limitations. Santa Monica College Faculty Ass’n. v. Santa Monica Community
College (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 538, 546; Huens v. Tatum (1997) 52
Cal.App.4th 249, 264. 
 
The one-year
deadline for filing a §911.4 application functions as a jurisdictional statute
of limitations. Sahman is not entitled to relief for attorney error under
§473(b). Code of Civ. Proc. §911.4 (c) (1)-(3) sets forth several circumstances
under which the one-year application period is tolled. Excusable attorney
neglect is not one of them. There is no authority under which this court can
excuse Sahman from failure to comply with Government Claims Act. SUSTAINED
without leave to amend.
