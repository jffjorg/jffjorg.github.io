Alathel Real
Estate Investment v. Turkel, Case No. 23SMCV04805
Hearing Date
November 16, 2023 
Defendant Turkel’s
Motion to Quash Service of Summons 
 
Defendant tenant
Turkel moves to quash plaintiff landlord Alathel Real Estate’s five-day summons
for unlawful detainer, arguing failure to properly serve the summons and complaint.
 
 
An unlawful
detainer action allows service of a five-day summons, but only if the
underlying complaint sets forth a valid cause of action for unlawful detainer. Delta
Imports, Inc. v. Municipal Court (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 1033, 1035. Code of
Civ. Proc. §481.10 allows a defendant to move to quash service of a summons for
lack of jurisdiction.
 
The complaint includes
a proof service stating defendant was served by posting. Complaint, exhibit 3. Service
by posting requires plaintiff to show via affidavit “[t]he person cannot be
served in any other manner notwithstanding the application of reasonable
diligence.” Code of Civ. Proc. §415.45. Since plaintiff did not make such a
showing, service by posting was improper.
 
On November 13,
2023 plaintiff filed a proof of personal service, stating defendant was
personally served October 18, 2023. See 11/13/2023 POS. Defendant
provides no evidence to refute that proof of service. Defendant
argues plaintiff failed to “attach a lease with any notice of exemption to the
Tenant Protection Act,” so failed to strictly follow the statutory requirements
for unlawful detainer. The court assumes defendant is referring to Cal.
Civ. Code §1946.2, the Tenant Protection Act of 2019, which prohibits evictions
except for good cause after a tenant has occupied residential real property for
12 months. 
 
Defendant fails to
identify a statute requiring that the notice of exemption be attached to the
complaint. The complaint indicates the tenancy is subject to the Tenant Protection
Act, and the action is being brought for good cause (failure to pay rent).
Complaint, pg. 2. As the action is not based on a claimed exemption to the Tenant
Protection Act, there is no requirement to attach a notice of exemption. DENIED.
