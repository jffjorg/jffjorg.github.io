And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge regarding a motion to quash service of summons filed by defendant Turkel in an unlawful detainer action brought by plaintiff Alathel Real Estate Investment. The defendant argues that the service of summons was improper because the underlying complaint does not set forth a valid cause of action for unlawful detainer. The judge disagrees, ruling that the service was proper and that the defendant fails to identify a statute requiring attachment of a notice of exemption to the complaint. The judge also notes that the action is not based on a claimed exemption to the Tenant Protection Act, so there is no requirement to attach such a notice. The motion to quash service of summons is denied.
