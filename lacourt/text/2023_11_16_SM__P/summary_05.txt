And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Johnson's motion to consolidate the two cases: case 21STCV01974 (filed in 2021), which alleges habitability issues against Essex, and case 23SMUD01577 (filed in 2023), which seeks possession of Johnson's unit via unlawful detainer. The judge notes that while there are overlapping issues of fact and law between the two cases, the court's decision on the motion to consolidate is discretionary, not mandatory. The judge concludes that consolidating the cases would deny Essex the accelerated timing of an unlawful detainer claim and would effectively allow Johnson to file a cross-complaint, which is prohibited by statute and public policy underlying the UD procedures.
