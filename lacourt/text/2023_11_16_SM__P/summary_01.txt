And here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the Meehan defendants' motion to strike the memorandum of costs filed by Pacific Horizon Holdings, LLC. The Meehans argue that Pacific Horizon is not the prevailing party, as they prevailed on two causes of action (breach of CC&Rs and nuisance) and Pacific Horizon prevailed on only one cause of action (declaratory relief). The court notes that under Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §1032, the court has discretion to determine who is the prevailing party when a party recovers non-monetary relief. The court finds that it is difficult to separate the costs incurred in connection with the three claims, and it would be inequitable to award costs to Pacific Horizon and against the Meehans. Therefore, the court grants the Meehans' motion to strike the cost bill.
