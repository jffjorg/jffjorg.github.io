Johnson v. Essex
Property Trust, Inc., Case No. 21STCV01974 (related case 23SMUD01577) 
Hearing Date
November 16, 2023 
Plaintiff
Johnson’s Motion to Consolidate 21STCV01974 with Case No. 23SMUD01577
 
In case no.
21STCV01974 (filed 1/19/21) plaintiff Johnson alleges habitability issues against
landlord defendants Essex Property Management Corporation, Essex Property Trust
and Essex Foundation Park Apartment L.P. (collectively “Essex”). In case no.
23SMUD01577 (filed 10/11/23), Essex seeks possession of Johnson’s unit via
unlawful detainer. Johnson moves to consolidate. 
 
Cal. Code of Civ. Proc.
§1048 allows a court to order consolidation of actions involving common questions
of law or fact to promote “convenience and economy by avoiding duplication of
procedure.” Estate of Baker (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 471, 485. A court’s
decision on a motion to consolidate is discretionary, not mandatory. E.g. Fellner
v. Steinbaum (1955) 132 Cal.App.2d 509.
 
Johnson asserts breaches
of the warranty of habitability as defenses in the UD action. She argues both
cases require adjudication of habitability claims and consolidation would avoid
potentially inconsistent rulings and redundant presentation of evidence.
 
Unlawful detainer
actions are summary proceedings, subject to an expedited schedule for motions,
discovery and trial. Code of Civ. Proc. §1161, 1174, Vasey v. California
Dance Co., Inc. (1977) 70 Cal.3d 765, 7646-47. Only possession is at issue
in a UD action, and cross-complaints are prohibited. Knowles v. Robinson (1963)
60 Cal.2d 620.
 
Consolidating the
actions would deny Essex the accelerated timing of an unlawful detainer claim.
Additionally, granting the motion would be tantamount to allowing Johnson to
file a cross-complaint, in defiance of the statutes and public policy
underlying the UD procedures. While it may be proper to consolidate UD claims
with simultaneously pending actions in which title is disputed, no title issues
are present here. E.g. Martin-Bragg v. Moore (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 367,
385. Although there are overlapping issues of fact and law, §1048 is
discretionary. To preserve the summary nature of the unlawful detainer
proceeding, the motion is DENIED.
