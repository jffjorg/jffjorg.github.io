And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Johnson's motion to consolidate Case No. 21STCV01974 with Case No. 23SMUD01577. Johnson alleges habitability issues against landlord defendants Essex Property Management Corporation, Essex Property Trust, and Essex Foundation Park Apartment L.P. (collectively "Essex") and seeks to consolidate the cases to avoid duplicate proceedings. Essex, on the other hand, seeks possession of Johnson's unit via unlawful detainer. The judge finds that consolidating the cases would deny Essex the accelerated timing of an unlawful detainer claim and would be tantamount to allowing Johnson to file a cross-complaint, which is prohibited by statute. The judge notes that while there are overlapping issues of fact and law, the decision to consolidate is discretionary and that preserving the summary nature of the unlawful detainer proceeding takes precedence.
