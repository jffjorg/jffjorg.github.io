## English Summary

This tentative ruling postpones a decision on a demurrer and stay request by Defendants in a lawsuit concerning a toll-free number (800-777-7777).  

Judge Takasugi acknowledges the existence of three other pending lawsuits dealing with the same underlying issues. A fourth lawsuit, the "Nazar Action," is set for trial in October 2023 and will determine the rightful ownership of the number.  Because the current case raises similar questions and seeks similar relief as the Nazar Action, a stay is likely appropriate to avoid conflicting rulings. 

However, Judge Takasugi is waiting for another judge to rule on whether the current case is related to the Nazar Action.  If they are deemed related, the stay will likely be moot. The hearing is continued to a date after October 3, 2023, to allow for this determination.

The Judge is continuing the hearing to a date after October 3, 2023, to allow Judge Long to rule on the Notice of Related Cases. The case involves disputes over the rights to a toll-free number, with multiple lawsuits pending. The Judge notes that the Nazar Action, scheduled for trial on October 23, 2023, will address the same issues as this case, including whether the Fernandez Defendants had rights to the Number and whether they breached their duties to the Nazar Defendants. The Judge finds it prudent to withhold a ruling until Judge Long has had an opportunity to determine whether the cases are related or should be consolidated.
