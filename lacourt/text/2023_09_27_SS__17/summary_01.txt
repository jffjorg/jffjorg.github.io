And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Mansal Mansour, has filed a motion for reconsideration of the court's previous ruling granting the defendant, Hyundai Motor America, a motion to compel arbitration. The plaintiff argues that the court's previous ruling was based on a change in law, specifically the recent decision in Martha Ochoa v. Ford Motor Company (2023) Cal.Ct.App., which reached the opposite conclusion as the court's previous ruling. The court agrees that the new law warrants reconsideration of the previous order and grants the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration. The court finds that the defendant cannot compel arbitration based on the arbitration clause contained in the selling dealership's contract, and the previous ruling granting the motion to compel arbitration is reversed.
