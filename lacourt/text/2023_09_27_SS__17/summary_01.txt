The plaintiff, Mansal Mansour, has filed a motion for reconsideration of the court's previous ruling granting the defendant, Hyundai Motor America, a motion to compel arbitration. The plaintiff argues that the court's previous ruling was based on a change in law, specifically the recent decision in Martha Ochoa v. Ford Motor Company (2023) Cal.Ct.App., which reached the opposite conclusion as the court's previous ruling. The court agrees that the new law warrants reconsideration of the previous order and grants the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration. The court finds that the defendant cannot compel arbitration based on the arbitration clause contained in the selling dealership's contract, and the previous ruling granting the motion to compel arbitration is reversed.

## English Summary:

This tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to reconsider the Court's previous decision to compel arbitration. The original ruling, based on the concept of equitable estoppel, allowed the Defendant (Hyundai Motor America) to enforce an arbitration agreement found within the contract between Plaintiff and the dealership where she purchased her vehicle.  

However, a recent Court of Appeal decision, *Martha Ochoa v. Ford Motor Company*, directly addresses this issue and concludes that automakers cannot compel arbitration based on such dealership contracts.  Because this new legal precedent contradicts the basis of the original ruling, the Court finds it necessary to reconsider and vacate the previous order compelling arbitration.

However, CCP section 1008, subdivision (c), provides 'If a court at any time determines that there has been a change of law that warrants it to reconsider a prior order it entered, it may do so on its own motion and enter a different order.'"
  - "In rejecting the car manufacturer's right to enforce the Sales Contract's arbitration agreement under a theory of third-party beneficiary or equitable estoppel, the Court wrote: 'We agree with the trial court that FMC [Ford] could not compel arbitration based on plaintiffs' agreements with the dealers that sold them the vehicles. Equitable estoppel does not apply because, contrary to FMC's arguments, plaintiffs' claims against it in no way rely on the agreements.'"
```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the previous ruling that granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The plaintiff had filed suit against the defendant alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Act. The defendant had moved to compel arbitration based on an arbitration agreement in the Sales Contract, citing equitable estoppel. However, the court has reconsidered its previous ruling based on a recent publication of Martha Ochoa v. Ford Motor Company (2023) Cal.Ct.App., which holds that an automaker may not compel arbitration based on the arbitration clause contained in the selling dealership's contract. The court finds that this change in law justifies a reconsideration of the previous order.
