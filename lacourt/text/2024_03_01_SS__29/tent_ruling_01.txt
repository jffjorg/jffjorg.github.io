  Case Number:  20STCV19067    Hearing Date:   March 1, 2024    Dept:  29 Plaintiffs’ Motion to Deem Admitted the Truth of the
Matters Specified in Requests for Admission (Set Two) 
 
Tentative
The
motion is denied.
Background
On May 19, 2020, Plaintiffs Alvin Mount and Nella Mount (“Plaintiffs”)
filed a complaint against Defendants California Highway Patrol, Alfredo
Gutierrez, State of California and Does 1 through 100, asserting causes of
action for wrongful death and negligence. Plaintiffs allege that on or about
October 27, 2019, decedent Cezannie Mount was killed by Defendant Alfredo
Gutierrez, who was riding his CHP motorcycle at an unlawful and excessive speed
while in the course and scope of his employment. (Complaint, ¶ 10.)
Defendant State of California, acting by and through the California
Highway Patrol (“CHP”), filed its answer on July 10, 2020.  Defendant Alfredo Gutierrez (“Gutierrez”)
filed his answer on August 21, 2020.
This case was stayed for approximately two years while a criminal
prosecution against Gutierrez was pending. 
The criminal trial apparently ended in a hung jury, after which all
charges were dismissed.  The stay in this
case was lifted on April 21, 2023.
Trial of this civil matter has been continued several times.  In August 2022, the Court, on the stipulation
of the parties, continued trial from August 25, 2022, to September 19,
2023.  In June 2023, trial was continued
to February 21, 2024.  On February 9,
2024, trial was continued to March 6, 2024, but the fact discovery deadlines
were not extended.  Most recently, trial
was continued again on February 28, but again the fact discovery deadlines were
not extended. 
On November 30,
2023, Plaintiffs served Defendant California Highway Patrol (“Defendant”) with Requests
for Admission (Set Two). (Dubin Decl., ¶ 3.)
 
On January 10,
2024, Plaintiffs filed this motion to deem admitted the truth of the matters specified
in Requests for Admission (Set Two). Defendant filed its opposition on February
16, 2024. Plaintiffs filed their reply on February 23, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
that the truth of the matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted. (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for such a motion, and no meet
and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2033.280; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the matters contained in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a
party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may
impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(a).)
"Except as otherwise provided in this
chapter, any party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery
proceedings on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery
heard on or before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of
the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a).) 
Discussion
Plaintiffs
served the Requests for Admission (“RFAs”) at issue on November 30, 2023.
(Dubin Decl., ¶ 3.)  Plaintiffs contend
that Defendant failed to respond by January 2, 2024, and therefore waived all
objections. 
 
Defendant
contends that the RFAs were not properly served but, even so, Defendant became
aware of the RFAs after receiving communications from Plaintiffs, and then
Defendant served verified responses on January 8.  (Bart Decl., ¶¶ 2-5 & Exh. D.) 
 
In their
Opposition, Defendant raises a threshold issue regarding timeliness.  Although the trial date has been continued,
the trial date for purposes of determining the deadlines for fact discovery is February
21, 2024.  The subsequent continuances of
the trial date did not extend the deadlines for fact discovery.
 
Based on
the trial date of February 21, the last day for hearing motions regarding fact
discovery was February 6, 2024.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a).) 
Plaintiffs filed this motion on January 10, 2024, but Plaintiffs did not
seek or obtain a court order advancing the hearing date on the motion or
extending the deadline for fact discovery motions.
 
Accordingly,
the motion is denied on timeliness grounds. 
The deadline for hearing fact discovery motions in this case was on
February 6, almost a month ago.
 
Conclusion
The Court
DENIES Plaintiffs’ motion.
 
Moving Party is
ORDERED to give notice.
