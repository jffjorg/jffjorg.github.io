And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Walmart, Inc. to specially set a hearing for a motion for summary judgment or in the alternative, to continue the trial date. The motion to continue the trial is granted, and the trial date is continued to late April 2025. The judge finds that Walmart, Inc. has shown good cause for a continuance, as it has the right to have the motion for summary judgment heard prior to the trial. The judge cannot accommodate the request to advance the hearing for summary judgment, but the parties are free to check for available dates on the court's calendar system.
