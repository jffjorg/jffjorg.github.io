And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel filed by Irving Pedroza, counsel for Plaintiff Maria de Los Angeles Leon Lili. The motion is denied without prejudice due to deficiencies in the filing. Specifically, the required forms were not served on all parties, and the Declaration and Order omitted relevant information. The Judge notes that the determination of whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. The motion is denied without prejudice, and counsel is ordered to give notice.
