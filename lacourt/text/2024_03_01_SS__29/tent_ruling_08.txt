 Case Number:  22STCV28804    Hearing Date:   March 1, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s Irving
Pedroza.
 
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice.
Background
This case arises out of an incident on
September 7, 2020, in which Plaintiff Maria de Los Angeles Leon Lili
(“Plaintiff”) alleges that she was injured in a CVS Pharmacy on West Seventh
Street in Los Angeles when a plywood board securing a window came loose and
fell on her.  Plaintiff filed the Complaint
on September 2, 2022, and the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) on November 14,
2022.  In the FAC, Plaintiff asserts causes
of action for premises liability and general negligence against Defendants CA
CVS Pharmacy, LLC; RC Store Maintenance, Inc. (“RC”); Allied Restoration
Services, Inc. (“Allied”); and Does 1 through 50.
Defendant Garfield Beach CVS, L.L.C.
(erroneously sued as CA CVS Pharmacy, LLC) (“CVS”) filed its Answer on November
14, 2022.  On the same day, CVS filed a
Cross-Complaint against RC and Roes 1 through 10.
On January 5, 2023, RC filed its Answer to
the FAC and a Cross-Complaint against Allied and Foes 1 through 50.
On January 9, 2023, Allied filed its Answer
to the FAC.
On January 17, 2023, CVS filed its Answer to
the FAC.
On June 5, 2023, the Court, at the request of
CVS, dismissed without prejudice CVS’s Cross-Complaint.
On June 6, 2023, Allied filed its Answer to
RC’s Cross-Complaint. 
On February 2, 2024, Irving Pedroza (“Counsel”) filed a motion to be relieved as
counsel for Plaintiff.  No opposition has
been filed. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other. (Code
of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration and Order to be Relieved as Counsel. On the
Declaration, Counsel states there has been a breakdown of the attorney-client
relationship. Counsel has confirmed Plaintiff’s last known address by telephone.
 
According to the
proof of service, Counsel has served the Notice, Decaration, and Order on Plaintiff
but not the other parties in this matter. 
That is not sufficient.
In addition, Counsel
omits the OSC re Dismissal scheduled for August 30, 2024 on the Declaration (item
5) and Order (item 8).
Accordingly, the
motion is DENIED without prejudice.
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is DENIED without prejudice.
Moving counsel
to give notice.
