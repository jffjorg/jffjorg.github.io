And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court will hear from counsel regarding whether DoorDash's most recent discovery responses have resolved or not resolved the disputes. The case arises from a fatal automobile accident on June 7, 2023, on La Cienega Boulevard in the Pico-Robertson area of Los Angeles. Plaintiffs, The Estate of Bing Wang, Xiaomei Wang, and Wenxuan Wang, filed a complaint against DoorDash, Inc., Vladimir Tishchenko, and Does 1-10.

Plaintiffs served discovery requests, including Form Interrogatories and Requests for Production, on September 28, 2023. DoorDash served objections and unverified responses, and later supplemental responses. Plaintiffs contends that DoorDash's responses are still not code compliant and filed a motion to compel further responses on November 27.

The Court will consider the motion and the parties' agreements to participate in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC). The Court will also consider the legal standard regarding motions to compel further responses, including the requirement for a meet-and-confer declaration and a separate statement or concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.

The Court will also consider the possibility of imposing monetary sanctions against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further responses, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
