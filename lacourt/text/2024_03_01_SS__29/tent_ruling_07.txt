 Case Number:  22STCV19271    Hearing Date:   March 1, 2024    Dept:  29 Tentative
The hearing on the motion is continued.
Background
On June 13, 2022,
Plaintiff Alvin Hernandez Silva (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against Defendant
Miguel Arriola Duran (Defendant) and Does 1 through 20. Plaintiff asserts two
causes of action (for negligence and negligence per se) arising out of a motor vehicle
accident on July 25, 2020.  Defendant appeared
by filing a motion to strike on July 5, 2023 (which the Court granted), and
then Defendant filed an answer on October 13, 2023.
On July 5,
2023, Plaintiff served Defendant with discovery requests, including Requests
for Production (Set One). (Yadegari Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh. 1.)  No responses were received. (Id., ¶
3.)
 
On January 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed
this motion to compel. Plaintiff also seeks sanctions.  Defendant filed an untimely opposition on February
21, 2024.  Defendant also seeks
sanctions.
 
No reply has been filed.
 
The Court is aware that there are
three other discovery motions pending in this matter, one set for hearing on
March 7 and the other two set for hearing on March 14, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
A party
must respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests
for production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial
responses to requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On July
25, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant with Requests for Production (Set One).
(Yadegari Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh. 1.)  The
copy of the document request attached to counsel’s declaration, however, has no
proof of service.  (Id., Exh. 1.) 
 
Defendant contends that that discovery
was served by email but not to the proper email address that Defendant has
designated to receive service.  (Jozana
Decl., ¶¶ 4 & 5.)  Notwithstanding
the dispute about service, Defendant provided discovery responses on February
19, 2024.  (Id., ¶ 12 & Exh. H.) 
 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 1010.6 provides for (among other things) electronic
service of discovery documents. Subdivision (b)(3) requires the person
effecting service to “confirm the appropriate electronic service address for
the counsel being served,” and subdivision (b)(4) requires electronic service
on any counsel “who provides an electronic service address.” California Rule of
Court, rule 2.251(b), (c), and (g) require parties to provide an electronic
address for service and to file a notice of any change in such address.
 
The
Court recognizes that Defendant’s opposition was not timely filed, and that Plaintiff
may not have had a complete opportunity to file a reply.  
 
The
Court also recognizes that there are three other pending motions in this matter
that raise this same issue.
 
Accordingly,
the Court CONTINUES the hearing on this motion to March 14, 2024, at 1:30 pm.
 
Moreover,
the Court, on its own motion, advances and CONTINUES the hearing set for March 7,
2024 to March 14, 2024, at 1:30 pm.
 
The
Court ORDERS the parties to meet and confer (by telephone, video conference, or
in person meeting, but not merely by an exchange of emails, voice mails, or
other messages) by no later than March 7, 2024 to discuss these four motions and
to determine whether the parties may reach an agreement whereby: (1) all four
motions are taken off calendar (without prejudice to any motion to compel a further
response); (2)  each side withdraws its
request for sanctions on all four motions; and (3) counsel for each side
confirms the email address for service in this matter.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court CONTINUES the hearing on this motion, and the motion set for
hearing on March 7, 2024, to March 14, 2024.
 
Moving party to give notice.
