This tentative ruling concerns the petitions to approve compromises for two minors, Mia Smuskovitch (age 7) and Ella Smuskovitch (age 10). The petitions were filed on December 4, 2023, and the court identified certain issues that needed to be addressed. After reviewing the revised petitions, the court finds that all issues have been addressed, except for a discrepancy in the general expenses of $200.00 for photocopy and postage for each petition. The court has scheduled hearings for March 1, 2024, but continues them to April 9, 2024, to allow the petitioner to address the remaining issue. The court has also reviewed the settlement terms and requested attorney's fees, finding them to be fair and reasonable.
