And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge will hear arguments from counsel on March 1, 2024, regarding any outstanding disputes. The case arises from a motor vehicle accident on February 13, 2020, in Downey. Plaintiff Sharique Shaikh filed a complaint on June 1, 2021, alleging motor vehicle negligence against defendant Crisoforo Orozoco Manzaneres and Does 1-10. Defendant filed an answer on February 15, 2023.

Plaintiff served requests for production on September 7, 2023, and defendant responded with objection-only responses. After meet and confer correspondence failed to resolve the disputes, plaintiff filed a motion to compel further responses on December 11, 2023.

The judge will grant plaintiff's motion to compel further responses regarding requests 2, 4, 12, and 13, finding that the defendant's objections are without merit. However, the judge will deny plaintiff's motion regarding request 14, sustaining the defendant's work product objection.
