And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motions to compel responses to the plaintiff's interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admission. The plaintiff failed to respond to the defendant's discovery requests, which were served on October 9, 2023. The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to respond waives all objections and that the defendant need not show anything more to establish the need for these motions. The court orders the plaintiff to provide verified, code-compliant, written responses to the defendant's discovery requests within 14 days of notice. The court also orders that the plaintiff is deemed to have admitted the truth of the matters specified in the defendant's requests for admission.
