And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiffs' motion to deem admitted the truth of the matters specified in Requests for Admission (Set Two). The motion was filed on January 10, 2024, but was denied on timeliness grounds because it was filed after the deadline for hearing fact discovery motions, which was February 6, 2024. The judge also noted that the defendant's responses to the requests for admission were not timely, but that the defendant had served verified responses on January 8, 2024. The judge further noted that the defendant's failure to respond timely waived all objections. The judge also mentioned that the defendant became aware of the requests for admission after receiving communications from the plaintiffs, and that the defendant served the responses after receiving the communications. The judge concluded that the motion was denied due to timeliness and that the defendant's failure to respond timely waived all objections.
