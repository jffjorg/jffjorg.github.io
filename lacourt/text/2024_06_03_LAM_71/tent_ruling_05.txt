 Case No.: 
  23STCV09556
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  June 3, 2024



 
Defendant
Cuningham Group Architecture, Inc.’s unopposed motion to compel
Non-party Hunt Construction Group, Inc. to comply with a deposition subpoena
for the production of business records is granted.
Defendant’s
request for sanctions against Non-party Hunt Construction Group, Inc. is
granted in the reduced amount of $787.50.
 
Defendant
Cuningham Group Architecture, Inc. (“Cuningham”) (“Defendant”) moves unopposed
for this Court to compel Non-party Hunt Construction Group, Inc.  (“Hunt”) to comply with its Deposition
Subpoena for Production of Business Records on the grounds Hunt has failed to
provide any objection or response to Cuningham’s Deposition Subpoena for
Production of Business Records, and despite Cuningham’s inquiries and attempts
to meet and confer regarding the nonresponse, has failed to properly engage in
the meet and confer process in order to achieve a resolution without the
Court’s intervention.  (Notice of Motion,
pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §§1987 et seq., 1985.3, 2023 et seq., 2024.240, 2025.480(b).)  Cuningham requests sanctions against Hunt in
the amount of $2,012.50.  (Notice of Motion,
pg. 2.)
 
Background
          This matter arises from alleged
increases in construction costs and delays during the design and construction
of the Pendry Hotel and Residences in West Hollywood, California (“Project”).
Plaintiff Sunset Subsidiary, LLC (“Plaintiff”), is the owner and developer of
the Project.  Defendant was the architect
for the Project.  Non-party Hunt was the
general contractor for the Project.
On
December 22, 2023, Cuningham served a Deposition Subpoena for Business Records
(“Subpoena”) on Hunt’s registered agent for service of process at CT
Corporation.  (Decl. of Lee ¶3.)  The subpoena sought documents from Hunt
relating to the construction change orders and delays allegedly caused by Cuningham.  (Decl. of Lee ¶3.)
The
subpoenaed records were to be produced no later than January 16, 2024. (Decl.
of Lee ¶4.)  However, Hunt neither
objected to nor produced any documents in response to the subpoena.  (Decl. of Lee ¶4.)  To date, there has been no production of
documents.  (Decl. of Lee ¶4.)
A
deposition subpoena for business records directs a nonparty’s “custodian of
records” to deliver a copy of the requested documents to a deposition officer
or to make the original documents available to the subpoenaing party for
inspection and copying.  (C.C.P.
§§2020.410(c), 2020.430(a)-(e).)  
“If
a deponent fails to answer any question or to produce any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing under the deponent’s control that is
specified in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena, the party seeking
discovery may move the court for an order compelling that answer or
production.”  (C.C.P. §2025.480(a).)  When there is no record of the deposition and
no response has been served, the time limitations for filing a motion to compel
have not begun to run.  (Cf. Unzipped
Apparel, LLC v. Bader (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 123, 127.)
Here,
Hunt has failed to provide any response to the subpoena or produce any of the requested
documents. Therefore, Cuningham’s motion to compel compliance with its
deposition subpoena to Hunt is granted.
          
          Sanctions
C.C.P.
§§2023, et seq. authorizes this Court to impose monetary sanctions for “misuse
of the discovery process.”  Misuse of the
discovery process includes “[f]ailing to respond or submit to an authorized
method of discovery.”  (C.C.P. §2023.010(d).
In addition, C.C.P. §2023.050 states that “a court shall impose a
one-thousand-dollar ($1,000) sanction, payable to the requesting party,” if the
court finds that a person did not respond in good faith to a request for
production of documents, or if the person failed to confer with the party or
attorney requesting the documents in a reasonable and good faith attempt to
informally resolve any dispute concerning the request.”
Here,
Hunt failed to respond to the subpoena, an authorized method of discovery under
C.C.P. §§2020.010 and 2020.410.  Hunt
also failed to meet and confer with Cuningham’s counsel, despite multiple
attempts by Cuningham’s counsel to do.  
Hunt
was personally served with the motion. 
(California Rules of Court, rule 3.1346.)
Cuningham’s
counsel declares it incurred $1,012.50 in drafting, replying to, and attending
the hearing on this Motion.  Cuningham
further requests that the Court impose the additional $1,000 sanction provided
under C.C.P. §2023.050 for Hunt’s failure to respond in good faith to the
request for production of documents and the failure to meet and confer with Cuningham’s
counsel, for combined monetary sanctions of $2,012.50 against Hunt.
The
Court is not inclined to grant additional sanctions beyond the costs reasonably
incurred by Cuningham to prepare and file the instant motion. Such costs do not
include anticipated attorneys’ fees.  In
light of the fact the instant motion is unopposed, the Court calculates
sanctions as follows:
$225.00
x 2.5 hours = $787.50
Accordingly,
the Court grants Cuningham’s request for sanctions in the reduced total amount
of $787.50.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s
unopposed motion to compel Hunt to comply with Defendant’s Deposition
Subpoena for Production of Business Records is granted.  Hunt is to produce the requested documents
within 20 days.
Defendant’s
request for sanctions against Hunt is granted in the reduced amount of
$787.50.  Sanctions are payable within 20
days.
Moving Party is to give notice of this ruling.
