And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted the Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction, allowing the Plaintiff to remove the fence from their property and easement. The Plaintiff, Rolling Hills Community Association of Rancho Palo Verdes, had alleged that the Defendant, George Cashman Jr., Cynthia C. Makin, and the GFC Administrative Trust, had breached the Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CCRs) by constructing a fence on their easement. The Judge found that the Plaintiff was likely to prevail on the merits and that the harm that could be suffered by the community in the event of a wildfire outweighed the harm that could be suffered by the Defendant. The Judge also found that the Defendant had failed to demonstrate any of the elements necessary for an equitable easement, implied easement, prescriptive easement, or easement by adverse possession. Consequently, the Judge granted the Preliminary Injunction and ordered the Plaintiff to remove the fence at their own expense and to post a bond in the amount of $10,000 to offset the potential expenses of replacing the fence.
