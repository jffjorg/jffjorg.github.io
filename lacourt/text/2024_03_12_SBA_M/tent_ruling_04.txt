Cross-Complaint       

TENTATIVE RULING
 
            KRA Legal, P.C, and Kenechi R. Agu’s
Demurrer to Cross-Complaint is sustained without leave to amend, with further
instructions noted below.  
 
            Background
 
            Plaintiff filed the Complaint-in-Interpleader on October
17, 2022. Plaintiff alleges the following facts. Plaintiff represented Pamela
Hutchins in a motor vehicle injury action. Hutchins sought medical treatment.
The medical providers provided services pursuant to a lien. Eventually,
Hutchins’ action settled for $250,000. Plaintiff filed the instant interpleader
action and deposited all monies allocated to the medical providers with the
Court. Cross-Complainant Spine Care & Orthopedic Physicians filed the
Cross-Complaint on September 21, 2023. Cross-Complainant alleges the following
causes of action: 1. Negligent Interference with Prospective Economic
Relations; 2. Unjust Enrichment/Restitution.  
 
            Meet and Confer
  
            Cross-Defendant set
forth a meet and confer declaration in sufficient compliance with CCP §
430.41.  (Decl. Kenechi R. Agu.)   
 
            Demurrer

            A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a
matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v. Foundation Health
(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In
testing the sufficiency of the complaint, the court must assume the truth of
(1) the properly pleaded factual allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably
inferred from those expressly pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) 
The Court may not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of
fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe
(1994) 7 Cal.App.4th 634, 638.) Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency
of a complaint, the plaintiff must show that the complaint alleges facts
sufficient to establish every element of each cause of action.  (Rakestraw v. California Physicians
Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) 
Where the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.  (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig v. County of
Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
 
            Sufficient facts are the essential facts of the case
"with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently specific to
acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his cause of
action.”  (Gressley v. Williams
(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.) 
"Whether the plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is
irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer." 
(Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605,
609–610.)  Under Code Civil Procedure §
430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is “uncertain.”  Uncertainty exists where a complaint’s
factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently apprise a
defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
 
            Cross-Defendants demur to the Cross-Complaint as follows:
“The Cross-Complaint is subject to demurrer in its entirety on the grounds that
it exceeds the scope of claims permitted against a stakeholder in an
interpleader action. [Conner v. Bank of Bakersfield (1917) 174 Cal. 400].”
(Demurrer, page 1, lines 6-8.)
 
            The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend based on
existing California case law authority that has not been overruled.
 
            Established case law holds that with respect to an
interpleader action, the only question that can be litigated in the
interpleader action as to the interpleader plaintiff and the interpleader
defendants is the right to compel interpleader and whether the elements of an
interpleader exist. Conner v. Bank of Bakersfield (1920) 183 Cal. 199.
Affirmative relief is not available by an interpleader defendant against an
interpleader plaintiff. Id. The only relief available for an
interpleader defendant is dismissal of the complaint. City of Los Angeles v.
Amidor (1903) 140 Cal. 400. Claims against the interpleader plaintiff
arising out of the subject matter of the interpleader can only be considered in
a separate action. Id.
A judgment may potentially
be rendered against an interpleader plaintiff only with respect to actions
involving the interpleader itself and not any underlying disputes that resulted
in the depositing of the funds. McCreary v. Falconer (1935) 3 Cal. 2d
335. 
 
            Cross-Complainant urges the Court to follow a federal
case which applied California law in holding that CCP § 426.30 applied to
interpleader actions. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals stated that a
related claim against the stakeholder is barred if not raised in the
interpleader action. Cheiker v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 820 F2d
334, 336 (9th Cir. 1987). However, first, this federal case, while
it applies California law, is not binding authority in the State. Second, in
reviewing the case, the Court of Appeals only analyzed the statutory principles
related to compulsory cross-complaints and did not consider, at all, the
existing case law authorities noted above. 
 
            The instant Court also recognizes a California state law
case that stated that the interpleader statute could certainly be interpreted
to preclude a cross-complaint and could be read to preclude such a
cross-complaint. Thus, the interpleader statute could be “an exception to the
compulsory cross-complaint rule of section 426.30.” State Farm Fire &
Cas. Co. v. Pietak (2001) 90 CA4th 600, 612. However, the Court noted that
presumably the stakeholder could waive this right and not object to a
stakeholder bringing a claim within the interpleader action. Id. at 615.

 
            Here, by filing this demurrer, interpleader Plaintiff has
clearly made its intention known to not waive the right to not have claims
asserted against it within the interpleader. The instant Court will, however,
request that Plaintiff reconsider this objection because the procedural
mandates that will be listed below, while certainly authorized, would not
necessarily result in the most efficient and economical use of the parties’ or
the Court’s resources.
 
            If the Plaintiff does not reconsider its stance, the
Court makes the following ruling.
 
            The demurrer to the Cross-Complaint is sustained without
leave to amend. Cross-Complainant’s Cross-Complaint is hereby severed from the
instant action and Cross-Complainant can pursue this action as an independent
action. However, Cross-Complainant can, of course, file a notice of related
cases and request that the action be deemed related to the instant action. The
Court would be inclined to relate the cases.
 
            Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
