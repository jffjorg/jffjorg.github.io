And here is the English-text summary:

Judge Gary Y. Tanaka's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the Cross-Complaint without leave to amend. The Cross-Complaint, filed by Spine Care & Orthopedic Physicians, alleges causes of action for Negligent Interference with Prospective Economic Relations and Unjust Enrichment/Restitution. The Court finds that the Cross-Complaint exceeds the scope of claims permitted against a stakeholder in an interpleader action, citing existing California case law authority. The demurrer is sustained based on the established case law, which holds that an interpleader plaintiff can only be sued for the interpleader itself and not for underlying disputes. The Court orders that the Cross-Complaint be severed from the instant action and that Cross-Complainant can pursue this action as an independent action.
