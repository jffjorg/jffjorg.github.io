PROCEEDINGS
 
            American Express National Bank v. Leon Thompson, et
al. 
            19TRCV00261
1.      American
Express National Bank’s Motion to Vacate the Conditional Dismissal and for
Entry of Judgment Pursuant to CCP 664.6    
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            American
Express National Bank’s Motion to Vacate the Conditional Dismissal and for
Entry of Judgment Pursuant to CCP 664.6 is granted. 
       
            Background
 
            Plaintiff
filed the Complaint on March 22, 3029. Plaintiff alleges the following facts. This
is an action for common counts in which Plaintiff contends that it is owed
$52,283.82. 
 
            Motion
to Enforce Settlement Agreement
 
            CCP § 664.6 states: “If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.”
 
            Plaintiff contends that the parties entered into a
settlement agreement executed on May 15, 2019. (Decl., Scott D. Dyle, ¶¶ 3-4; Ex.
1.)  Plaintiff states that Defendant
breached the terms of the settlement agreement. According to Plaintiff, Defendant
has not made a payment since May 2021. (Id. at ¶ 7.) The Court notes that
Defendant failed to file any written opposition to the motion. 
 
               Therefore, the Court determines that Plaintiff has met
its burden to establish that a breach of the settlement agreement exists such
that a judgment, pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, may be
ordered.  
 
               Thus, Plaintiff’s Motion to Vacate the Conditional
Dismissal and for Entry of Judgment is granted.  
 
               Plaintiff is ordered
to give notice of this ruling.
