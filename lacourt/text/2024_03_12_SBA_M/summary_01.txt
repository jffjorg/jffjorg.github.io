And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted Plaintiff's motion to set aside the default and default judgment and to dismiss the action as to Defendant Artiano's Appetizers. The Court finds that the default and default judgment were caused by mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, and that equitable relief is warranted. The motion was filed outside of the six-month time period specified in CCP ยง 473(b), but the Court has invoked its equitable power to grant the motion. The Court notes that Defendant cannot argue that it would be prejudiced by having its own default and default judgment set aside and its dismissal entered. The Court orders Plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
