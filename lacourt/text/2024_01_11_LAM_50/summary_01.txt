And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion by Yehuda Maimon, individually and as Trustee of the Brigitte Mizrahi Living Trust, to deny Eric Mizrahi's claim of exemption. The Court has found that Maimon has demonstrated good cause to deny Mizrahi's claim of exemption, as the claim does not adequately describe the property claimed to be exempt, fails to provide a citation of the provision of this chapter or other statute upon which the claim is based, and does not provide a statement of the facts necessary to support the claim. The Court has also found that the Financial Statement attached to the Claim of Exemption is incomplete and inaccurate. The Court has granted Maimon's motion and has continued the hearing on the instant motion to a later date.
