  Case Number:  19STCV20287    Hearing Date:   May 16, 2024    Dept:  28             Having reviewed Defendants Gordon Lee's and Jonathan  Lee’s unopposed Motions to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories and Request  for Production of Documents, the Court rules as follows.            On November 28, 2023, Defendants Gordon Lee and Jonathan  Lee served Supplemental Interrogatories, Set No. One, and Supplemental Request  for Production of Documents, Set No. One, on Plaintiff Tonya Graham.            Responses were due on January 18, 2024. Plaintiff Tonya  Graham failed to provide timely responses. Defendants Gordon Lee and Jonathan  Lee now move to compel code-compliant responses.            The Court grants the motion to compel responses to the  supplemental interrogatories under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290,  subdivision (b), and orders Plaintiff Tonya Graham to provide verified  responses to the interrogatories compliant with Code of Civil Procedure  sections 2030.210, subdivision (a), and 2030.220 without objections by May 26,  2024.            The Court grants the motion to compel responses to the  request for production of documents under Code of Civil Procedure section  2031.300 and orders Plaintiff Tonya Graham to provide verified responses  compliant with Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.210 and to produce the  documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things requested  without objections by May 26, 2024.            Defendants Gordon Lee and Jonathan Lee request monetary  sanctions totaling $910.68.  Under Code  of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300, sanctions are available  against parties, persons, and attorneys who unsuccessfully make or oppose a  motion to compel a response to interrogatories or requests for production. (See  Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c)  [demand for inspection].) Plaintiff did not make or oppose a motion to compel  responses to interrogatories or requests for production. Therefore, sanctions  are not available under these statutes.          Other  statutes addressing misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves,  authorize a sanctions award for these motions. (See Code Civ. Proc., §  2023.010.) Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010 is “ ‘definitional’ and  monetary sanctions may not be imposed based solely on [the statute]. Monetary  sanctions may be imposed only if authorized by some other provision of the  Discovery Act.” (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure  Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 8:1900, p. 8M-2; see Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030  [court may impose sanctions for misuse of the discovery process “[t]o the  extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or  other provision of this title”]; City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers,  LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 498-504, review granted Jan. 23, 2023 with order  permitting citation of opinion for its persuasive value and to establish the  existence of a conflict in authority that would “allow trial courts to exercise  discretion . . . to choose between sides of any such conflict”.)  California  Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a), provides: “The court may award sanctions under  the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,  even though no opposition to the motion was filed . . . .”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1348(a).)  “ ‘Rules of court have the force of law and  are as binding as procedural statutes as long as they are not inconsistent with  statutory or constitutional law.’ ” (Fidelity National Home Warranty Company  Cases (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 812, 842, fn. 41, quoting In re I.V. (2017) 11  Cal.App.5th 249, 256.)  Interpreting rule  3.1348(a) to authorize an award of sanctions on the motions to compel would be  inconsistent with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300.)  Moving  parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
