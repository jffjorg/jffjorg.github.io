No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court to approve the compromise of Plaintiff’s pending claims. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“‘[W]ithout
trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the
settlement cannot be valid. [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding [on
the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson v. Superior
Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338; see Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) 
To
obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner
must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and
must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of
the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co.
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) 
DISCUSSION      
The
petition contains the following information about the proposed settlement:

Attorney’s

Net

Petitioner
has provided a copy of an August 9, 2023 letter from the Department of Health
Care Services stating that (1) Plaintiff received $390.70 in Medi-Cal benefits
and (2) reimbursement of $293.03 will satisfy DHCS’s lien subject to conditions
specified in the letter. 
Petitioner
has also provided a break-down of the non-medical expenses listed in Section
17d of the petition. (See Attachment 17d.) 
Petitioner
has checked the box in Section 10 affirming that “Petitioner has made a careful
and diligent inquiry and investigation into the facts and circumstances of the
incident or accident in which the claimant was injured; the responsibility for
the incident or accident; and the nature, extent, and seriousness of the
claimant’s injuries. Petitioner understands that if the compromise proposed in
this petition is approved by the court and consummated, the claimant will never
be able to recover any more compensation from the settling defendants named
below even if the claimant’s injuries turn out to be more serious than they now
appear.” 
The
Court grants the petition.  Petitioner
asks that the net settlement amount be deposited in an insured account at Wells
Fargo -- Imperial & Long Beach Branch, 3326 E Imperial Highway, Lynwood, CA
90262, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the Court.  The Court grants the request.
