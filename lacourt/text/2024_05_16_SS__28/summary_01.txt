The tentative ruling is issued by the Court on May 16, 2024, regarding the case number 19STCV20287. The case involves Gordon Lee and Jonathan Lee as defendants, and Tonya Graham as the plaintiff. The defendants served supplemental interrogatories and request for production on the plaintiff on November 28, 2023, with responses due on January 18, 2024.

The Court grants the motion to compel responses to the supplemental interrogatories and request for production, ordering the plaintiff to provide verified responses compliant with the Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300. Additionally, the defendants requested monetary sanctions totaling $910.68, but the Court denies this request as it is not authorized by the Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300.
