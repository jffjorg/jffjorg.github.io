And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by defendant Paul Pui Wu. Wu demurred to the first five causes of action in the complaint, alleging that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. He also moved to strike certain portions of the complaint. The judge has overruled Wu's demurrer and motion to strike.

Wu's arguments were based on various grounds, including the complaint not being served in compliance with California Rules of Court rule 3.110(b), the statute of limitations, and the need for administrative exhaustion. The judge found that Wu failed to provide legal authority to support his arguments and that the complaint was properly served and within the statute of limitations. The judge also found that the complaint was not time-barred by the three-year statute of limitations in Code of Civil Procedure § 338, as it was an action for public nuisance.

The judge declined to consider Wu's extrinsic facts and admonished counsel for including them in the demurrer and motion to strike. The judge also found that Wu's argument that the complaint was moot was not supported by the record.

The case is set for a Case Management Conference on July 23, 2024, and the judge's ruling is tentative and subject to change after further review and consideration of the parties' arguments.
