And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff's complaint alleges that the defendant's dog bit the plaintiff, causing injuries and damages. The plaintiff seeks damages in the amount of $342,438.00, which includes $42,438.00 in special damages and $300,000.00 in general damages. However, the judge notes that the relief granted to the plaintiff cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or the statement of damages filed by the plaintiff. The judge is also skeptical of the amount of general damages sought and notes that the plaintiff has failed to complete a portion of the proposed judgment identifying the defendant. Finally, the judge expresses concern about the lack of information provided about how the plaintiff's representative came to know that the defendant is not in the U.S. military.
