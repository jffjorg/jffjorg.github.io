Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default
Judgment is denied without prejudice. The following defects
are noted:
1.                 
Plaintiff’s
Statement of Damages (Galindo Decl., ¶ 6, Exh. B) lists $337,500.00 as the total
damages amount, which is itemized as follows: (1) $12,500.00 past medical
expenses; (2) $25,000.00 future medical expenses; (3) $250,000.00 past pain,
suffering, anxiety, disfigurement and (4) $50,000.00 future pain, suffering,
anxiety and disfigurement. Plaintiff, however, seeks $342,438.00 in total
damages via this instant default prove-up application, which is comprised of
$42,438.00 in special damages and $300,000.00 in general damages. “The relief
granted to the plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot exceed that demanded in
the complaint, in the statement required by Section 425.11 [i.e., statement of
damages], or in the statement provided for by Section 425.115 [i.e., punitive
damages statement] . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 580). 
2.                 
The court is not inclined to award anywhere near $300,000.00
in general damages 
($250,00.00
past/$50,000.00 future) based upon the information provided.
Plaintiff has
failed to complete that portion of Item 5a in the proposed judgment 
identifying
Defendant. 
3.                 
Plaintiff’s counsel attests, in the “declaration of
nonmilitary status,” that she knows Defendant is not in the U.S. military
because “Plaintiff’s representative has spoken with Defendant and knows she is
not in the U.S. military.” This statement fails to identify how
“Plaintiff’s representative” came to have such knowledge.
