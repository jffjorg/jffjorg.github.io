 Case Number:  23VECV02367    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2023    Dept:  T 23VECV02367 SANDRA
CALDERAS GOMEZ, et al. vs BLANCA GUEVARA
[TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Defendant 8817-35 Tobias Ave., LLC’s Demurrer
to the First Amended Complaint is SUSTAINED WITH 20 DAYS
LEAVE TO AMEND.  Leave to amend is
limited to curing the uncertainty in the second cause of action  and not to add new causes of action.
Introduction
Defendant 8817-35 Tobias
Ave., LLC (Defendant) demurred to Plaintiffs Jose De Jesus Sanchez Linez and
Sandra Calderas Gomez’s (collectively, Plaintiffs) First Amended Complaint
(FAC).  Defendant placed into issue the
second cause of action (COA) for “breach of the implied warranty of
habitability.”  Defendant was the alleged
owner of the property between 2008 to 2021. 
(FAC par. 6.)
Discussion 
Defendant argued that the
second COA for violation of Civil Code section 1942.4 failed to allege
sufficient facts and is uncertain. 
Defendant argued that Plaintiffs failed to plead facts to allege any
defect listed in Civil Code section 1941.1 or Health and Safety Code section
17920.10 and that a public code enforcement agency notified Defendant in
writing as to the required abatement or repair of the defective condition and
which Defendant failed to make the repairs. 
However, Plaintiffs asserted that the second COA is not a claim under
Civil Code section 1942.4 but, as titled, a claim for breach of the implied
warranty of habitability (i.e., a contract-based claim).   The uncertainty and confusion lies in
Plaintiffs’ allegation that the implied warranty exists in “every residential
agreement”, which infers a contract-based claim.  (FAC par. 82.)  But then in the same paragraph cited to Civil
Code section 1941 to infer a statutory-based claim.  Plaintiffs then subsequently referenced Civil
Code section 1942.4 in the COA by stating: 
“Defendants … continued to demand and receive rent in violation of
C.C.P. [sic] Section 1942.4.”  (FAC par.
85.)  There is further uncertainty in the
COA because the body of the COA alleged that the property “lacked the
affirmative standard characteristics identified in Section 1941.1 of the Civil
Code and Section 17920.10 of the Health and Safety Code.”  (FAC par. 83.)  The allegation is lifted from Civil Code
section 1942.4(a)(1).  A claim for a
breach of the implied warranty of habitability is based upon both contract
(i.e., the lease) and statute (i.e., Civ. Code, sec. 1942.4.)  (Erlach v. Sierra Asset Servicing, LLC (2014)
226 Cal.App.4th 1281, 1297-1299; Green v. Superior Court (1974) 10 Cal.3d 616,
629.)  Because Plaintiffs’ allegations
combined the contractual claim and the statutory claim into a singular COA, the
COA is uncertain.  Plaintiffs must
clarify upon which grounds the COA is alleged and/or plead the two claims
separately, if at all.  In that
Plaintiffs’ position is that the COA is not a statutory based claim, the
allegations referencing the Civil Code sections should be withdrawn.  Once the basis of the COA is clarified, the
Court can then determine if Defendant’s other arguments related to Civil Code
section 1942.4 are applicable. 
Defendant argued that the
COA failed to plead which of the several defendants breached their duties and
when the duties were breached.  The
argument is belied by Plaintiffs’ allegation as to when Defendant owned the property
and that at those relevant times all Defendants breached their duties.  Plaintiffs alleged that Defendant owned the
property between 2008 and 2021 (FAC par. 6) and Defendant’s breaches started in
2014 when Plaintiffs began their tenancy (FAC pars. 15-19.)  Defendant’s argument is unpersuasive because
the argument is based upon a narrow reading of the allegations. 
The demurrer to the
second COA is SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.

[TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Defendants Blanca Guevara and Panorama
Apartment Homes, LLC’s Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint
is SUSTAINED WITH 20 DAYS LEAVE TO AMEND as to the second cause of action and
SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND as to the seventh cause of action.  Leave to amend is limited to curing the
uncertainty in the second cause of action 
and not to add new causes of action.
Introduction
Defendants Blanca Guevara
(Guevara) and Panorama Apartment Homes, LLC (Panorama) (collectively,
Defendants) demurred to Plaintiffs Jose De Jesus Sanchez Linez and Sandra
Calderas Gomez’s (collectively, Plaintiffs) First Amended Complaint (FAC).  Defendants placed into issue the second cause
of action (COA) for breach of the implied warranty of habitability and the
seventh COA for violation of Civil Code section 1941.1.  Panorama is the alleged owner of the property
since December 2021.  (FAC par. 7.)  Guevara is the alleged property manager.  (FAC par. 8.)
Plaintiffs submitted to
the arguments in the demurrer to the seventh COA.  In that Plaintiffs submit that the seventh
COA is insufficiently pled, the demurrer to the seventh COA is SUSTAINED
WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
Discussion 
Defendants argued that
the second COA for violation of Civil Code section 1942.4 failed to allege
sufficient facts and is uncertain.

Defendants argued that
the COA failed to plead which of the several defendants breached their duties
and when the duties were breached.  The
argument is belied by Plaintiffs’ allegation as to when Defendants owned/managed
the property and that at those relevant times all Defendants breached their
duties.  Plaintiffs alleged that
Defendants owned/managed the property since 2021 (FAC par. 7-8) and Defendants’
breaches started in 2014 when Plaintiffs began their tenancy (FAC pars.
15-18.)  Defendant’s argument is
unpersuasive because the argument is based upon a narrow reading of the
allegations. 
The demurrer to the
second COA is SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK
TO GIVE NOTICE.
