And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint filed by the plaintiffs, Jose De Jesus Sanchez Linez and Sandra Calderas Gomez, against the defendants, 8817-35 Tobias Ave., LLC, Blanca Guevara, and Panorama Apartment Homes, LLC.

The defendants demurred to the second cause of action, which alleges a breach of the implied warranty of habitability, and argued that the complaint failed to plead sufficient facts and is uncertain. The judge agrees that the complaint is uncertain and sustains the demurrer, but grants the plaintiffs 20 days' leave to amend the complaint to clarify the second cause of action.

The judge also sustains the demurrer to the seventh cause of action, which alleges a violation of Civil Code section 1941.1, without leave to amend.

The judge's ruling is based on the analysis of the allegations in the complaint and the arguments presented by the parties. The judge finds that the plaintiffs' allegations are unclear and that the complaint fails to plead sufficient facts to support the second cause of action. The judge also finds that the complaint fails to plead which defendants breached their duties and when the duties were breached.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on further briefing and argument by the parties.
