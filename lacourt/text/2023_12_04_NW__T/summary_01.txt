And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint is granted without prejudice. The complaint was filed on October 22, 2019, and the service deadline was October 22, 2022. However, the defendant was not served until September 25, 2023, after the deadline had expired. The judge finds that the service was untimely and that the action must be dismissed under the mandatory provision of the Code of Civil Procedure. The plaintiff failed to file an opposition to dispute the issue, and the judge finds that the defendant's argument is persuasive. The motion to dismiss is granted without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff can re-file the action if they can show good cause for the delay.
