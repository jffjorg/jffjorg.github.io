19STCV37977 SALINAS V TRANSIT
[TENTATIVE] ORDER: 
Specially Appearing Defendant The Universal Church, Inc.’s Motion to
Dismiss is GRANTED without prejudice per Code of Civil Procedure sections
583.210 and 583.250.
Introduction 
Defendant The Universal Church, Inc. (Defendant), specially
appearing, moved to dismiss Plaintiffs Magdalena Fatima Salinas, Rosa Lidia
Alas, and Gregoria Moran Rodriguez’s (collectively, Plaintiffs) First Amended
Complaint (FAC).  (Code Civ. Proc., secs.
583.210 and 583.250, or 583.420.)  An
opposition was due November 17, 2023 and none was filed.  On November 21, 2023, Defendant filed a
notice that Plaintiffs’ opposition had not been filed.
Discussion  
Defendant provided that the complaint was filed on October
22, 2019.  Per the three-year service
deadline, Plaintiffs were required to serve the action by October 22,
2022.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec.
583.210.)  Defendant was substituted into
the action as Doe 1 on June 13, 2023. 
Plaintiff then filed the proof of service on September 27, 2023 showing
personal service on September 25, 2023. 
Plaintiffs were required to both “identify and serve a Doe Defendant”
within the three-year deadline. 
(Inversiones Papaluchi S.A.S. v. Superior Court (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th
1055, 1061.)  Dismissal is mandatory upon
untimely service.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec.
583.250.)  Plaintiffs both identified and
served Defendants after the three-year deadline expired.  The Court finds good cause to dismiss the
action under the mandatory provision due to the untimely identification and service
of the action upon Defendant. 
Defendant’s argument is persuasive. 
Plaintiffs failed to file an opposition to dispute the issue.  
The motion to dismiss for violation of the mandatory
three-year service deadline is GRANTED.  
Defendant’s alternative argument under the discretionary
two-year service deadline is MOOT.  (Code
Civ. Proc. sec. 583.420.)  Defendant’s
final argument under equitable estoppel is also MOOT.  
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO ENTER DISMISSAL WITHOUT PREJUDICE
AND GIVE NOTICE OF ENTRY OF DISMISSAL.
