And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Brandon Joaquin Rodarte Ayala's motion to tax costs, totaling $1,456.43. The judge finds that Defendant Xue Zhe Jin incurred unnecessary costs, including multiple filing fees for motions that were taken off-calendar during case transfers. The judge also finds that some of the filing fees were incurred as a matter of convenience, rather than necessity. Additionally, the judge finds that some of the electronic service fees were duplicated and therefore properly taxed. The total costs award is reduced to $4,964.57.
