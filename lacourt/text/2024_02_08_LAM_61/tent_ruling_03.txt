I.                  
MOTION TO
COMPEL
A propounding party may demand a responding
party to produce documents that are in their possession, custody or control.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.010.) A party may likewise conduct discovery by
propounding interrogatories to another party to be answered under oath. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2030.010, subd. (a).) The responding party must respond to the
production demand either by complying, by representing that the party lacks the
ability to comply, or by objecting to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.210.) The responding party must respond to the interrogatories by
answering or objecting. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.210, subd. (a).) If the
responding party fails to serve timely responses, the propounding party may
move for an order compelling responses to the production demand and
interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) 
 
A
party who fails to serve a timely response to interrogatories or a demand for
inspection waives any objection to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
2031.300.) 
Defendant Leonide
Hotel (Defendant) served form and special interrogatories and requests for
production upon Plaintiffs Sherry Wright, Nonillion Green, Lloyd Taylor,
Sara Walker, Paul Shaw, Paula Smith, Woody Derrick Russell, Alonzo Rubalcaba,
Derrick Matthew Knight, Marcia Green, Reginald Drummer, Judith Brown, Jacquelyn
Armstrong, Kerwin Barber, and Reginald Armstrong (Plaintiffs) on December 21, 2022. (Meekay Decl. ¶ 3.) The deadline to
respond to the discovery was extended by agreement to August 14, 2023. (Meekay
Decl. ¶ 9.) The deadline has passed without response. (Meekay Decl. ¶¶ 9–11.) 
 
Defendant has shown
that discovery was sent to Plaintiffs, the deadline for response has passed,
and no responses have been provided. No opposition to the motions has been
filed.
 
The motions are
therefore GRANTED.
