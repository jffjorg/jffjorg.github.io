MOTION TO TAX COSTS
 
“Any notice of motion to
strike or to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the
cost memorandum. If the cost memorandum was served by mail, the period is
extended as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1013. If the cost memorandum
was served electronically, the period is extended as provided in Code of Civil
Procedure section 1010.6(a)(4).” (California Rules of Court Rule 3.1700, subd.
(b)(1).) 
“Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (b) [],
guarantees prevailing parties in civil litigation awards of the costs expended
in the litigation: ‘Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a
prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any
action or proceeding.’” (Williams v. Chino Valley Independent Fire Dist.
(“Williams”) (2015) 61 Cal.4th 97,
100.).
 
“If the items on a verified cost bill appear proper charges,
they are prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses and services therein
listed were necessarily incurred.” (Rappenecker
v. Sea-Land Service, Inc. (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 256, 266.) Although
individual cost items are ordinarily challenged by a motion to tax costs, no
cost-item is effectively put in issue by “mere statements” claiming them to be
unreasonable. (Ibid.) However, where
“it cannot be determined from the face of the cost bill whether the items are
proper,” “the mere filing of a motion to tax costs may be a ‘proper objection’
to an item.” (Nelson v. Anderson (1999)
72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131, 132.)
 
Defendant Xue Zhe Jin (Defendant) filed a memorandum of
costs on October 25, 2023, seeking $6,421.00 in costs following the entry of
judgment in his favor on October 12, 2023. Plaintiff Brandon Joaquin Rodarte
Ayala (Plaintiff) filed the present motion to tax costs, seeking to tax the
$2,948.30 in filing and motion fees, $2,002.20 in deposition costs, and
$1,470.94 in fees for electronic filing or service.
 
Plaintiff’s challenges to the filing fees are
well-supported. These include the costs associated with filing Defendant’s
motion for summary judgment, motion for sanctions, and motion for protective
order — with each filing fee incurred three separate times, in three different
departments, as the present case bounced from Department 29 to Department 78,
and then to Department 61, between January 27 and March 8, 2023. Defendant
contends that these motions were taken off-calendar with each transfer, and the
multiple filings were required to re-set them. (Opposition at pp. 3–5.) But
this contentions is unsupported. One day after the case finally arrived in
Department 61 on March 8, 2023, a notice of case management conference was
issued, scheduling the conference for April 24, 2023. Such a conference would
have been the ordinary point at which to reschedule hearings placed
off-calendar during an earlier transfer. Defendant elected to incur the fees
for re-filing these motions because he did not desire to wait the month until
the case management conference.[1]
These were costs incurred as a matter of convenience, not reasonable necessity.

 
There are other problems with these filing costs. First,
Defendant claims three filing fees for these motions filed in Department 78,
when no such motions were filed with that department for the short time (from
February 7 to March 8, 2023) the case resided there. The costs memorandum cites
a motion for protective order filed in Department 29, yet the court’s records
indicate no filing of any such motion before this matter was transferred from
that department on January 27. And while Defendant did file a motion for a
protective order in Department 47 on January 30, 2023, Defendant himself sought
the transfer from that department (and thus the necessity of re-filing) by
filing a peremptory challenge to that department’s judge one week later.
 
Defendant’s filing fees are therefore properly taxed in the
following amounts. Defendant may not recover two of the three $513.75 filing
fees for his single motion for summary judgment, and may not recover two of the
three $61.65 filing fees for his motion for protective order. Defendant also
may not recover any filing fees for his motion for sanctions, which this court
denied. Thus $1,335.75 of these fees are taxed. 
 
Plaintiff’s arguments as to deposition costs, however, are
not persuasive. Plaintiff argues that Defendant has not provided a breakdown of
the $2,000.20 in deposition costs. (Opposition at p. 6.) Yet the costs
memorandum identifies three separate costs incurred in transcribing the
depositions of Plaintiff, Defendant, and Defendant I Park, Inc.’s person most
qualified. These costs are supported on their face.
 
Plaintiff’s final arguments directed to the electronic
service fees are of partial merit. Plaintiff’s contentions that certain fees
are listed twice for different amounts is not persuasive, as each of the fees
are for different transactions. However, these fees include the following
charges associated with duplicative filings of Defendant’s motion for summary
judgment, motion for sanctions, and motion for protective order:
·        
$34.85 for the first MSJ 
·        
$34.85 for the first motion for sanctions 
·        
$17.66 for the first motion for protective order
·        
$35.32 for the second motion for sanctions
filing
These costs, totaling $122.68, are properly taxed. 
 
The motion to tax costs is therefore GRANTED, and $1,456.43
in costs are taxed, leaving a total costs award of $4,964.57.
