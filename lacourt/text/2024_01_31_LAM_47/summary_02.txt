Summary in English text:

The Judge grants the Motion for Leave to File a Cross-Complaint filed by Defendants Alta Los Angeles Hospitals, Inc. and Prospect Medical Holdings, Inc. against Plaintiff ACCO Engineered Systems, Inc. The Cross-Complaint alleges that Plaintiff breached the contract by overcharging Defendants for the installation of HVAC equipment. The Judge finds that the claims are compulsory and not permissive, and that the Defendants did not act in bad faith. The Judge orders the Defendants to file a clean standalone copy of the proposed Cross-Complaint within 10 days of the order.

The Judge concludes that the Cross-Complaint arises out of the same transaction as Plaintiff's claims and must be considered a compulsory cross-claim. The Judge finds that Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate bad faith by the Defendants and that the Court has no discretion to deny leave to file the Cross-Complaint. The Judge notes that Plaintiff's arguments about prejudice and offset are irrelevant in the context of a compulsory cross-complaint.
