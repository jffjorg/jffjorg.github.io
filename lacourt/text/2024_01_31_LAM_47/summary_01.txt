significant_statements:
  - "A conflict of interest does not arise where the insurance company would be liable for any compensatory damages regardless of whether the jury finds the insured acted with malice."
  - "The Court finds no actual conflict of interest arising from these exclusions based on the legal authorities defining an insurance company's obligation to appoint independent counsel."
```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant, Travelers Casualty & Surety Co. of America, is entitled to summary adjudication on the issue of whether its reservation of rights letter created a duty to appoint independent counsel. The judge found that the exclusion of certain damages from the insurance policy did not create a conflict of interest that would require independent counsel. The judge also found that the defendant's reservation of rights with respect to the definition of "Loss" and the exclusion of certain damages did not create a conflict of interest. The judge noted that the insurance policy provides broad coverage for "back and front pay" and that the parties' interests in opposing damages would be fully aligned. The judge also found that the defendant's reservation of rights with respect to the definition of "Insured Person" did not create a conflict of interest. The judge concluded that the defendant has shown that the reservation of rights created no actual conflict of interest requiring independent counsel and that the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a triable issue of fact to the contrary.
