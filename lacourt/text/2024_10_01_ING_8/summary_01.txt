And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying three motions to compel further responses to discovery requests filed by the defendant, PSIP SN Vermont LLC. The motions were filed in response to the plaintiff, DRAKK Holdings, LLC's, failure to provide additional information in response to the defendant's discovery requests. The judge determined that the motions are moot because the court has already granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, which makes the discovery requests unnecessary.

The judge also noted that the parties have agreed that the discovery motions are moot and that the defendant will follow the plaintiff's counsel's declaration and submit a proposed order on the motion for summary judgment. The judge ordered the defendant to submit any objections to the proposed order by October 8, 2024.

The motion to compel further responses was denied, and the defendant's request for sanctions was also denied.
