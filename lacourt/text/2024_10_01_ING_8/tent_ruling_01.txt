I. BACKGROUND¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A. Factual¿ 
 
This case involves a dispute between Plaintiff DRAKK
(buyer) and Defendant PSIP (seller), regarding a purchase and sale agreement
(“PSA”) for real property. Plaintiff claims in its complaint that Defendant
failed to complete the sale of its subdivided parcel under the PSA. On the
other hand, Defendant alleges that DRAKK failed to complete the purchase of the
subdivided property because it did not have the funds in hand to pay the
purchase price on time, and that DRAKK’s claims of “financial ability” to borrow
or sell assets to get the funds at some future time are not sufficient to prove
DRAKK was “ready and able” to purchase on time. 
 
B. Procedural  
 
On November 30, 2022, Plaintiff filed the operative Third
Amended Complaint (“TAC”), alleging causes of action for: (1) Specific
Performance/Express Written Contract; (2) Specific Performance/Promissory
Estoppel; (3) Specific Performance/Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and
Fair Dealing; (4) Promissory Estoppel and Money Damages; (5) Fraud &
Deceit; and (6) Negligent Misrepresentation.¿ 
 
On August 12, 2024, Defendant PSIP filed the instant
motions to compel further responses.   On
September 13, 2024, the Court granted Defendant PSIP’s motion for summary
judgment after multiple continuances, and ordered Defendant to submit a
proposed order for the Court’s signature by October 1, 2024. 
 
On September 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed a single combined
opposition to the motions to compel.   On
September 23, 2024, Defendant filed a single combined reply in support of its
motions.

¿III. ANALYSIS¿ 
 
A. Legal Standard
 
On receipt of interrogatories,
requests for production of documents, or requests for admissions, the party
requesting admissions may move for an order compelling a further response. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (a)
[interrogatories]; 2031.310, subd. (a) [requests for production]; 2033.290, subd. (a) [requests for admission].)
 
Motions
to compel further responses to interrogatories, requests for production of
documents, and requests for admission must be brought within 45 days of service
of the verified response, supplemental verified response, or on a date to which
the propounding and responding parties have agreed to in writing; otherwise,
the propounding party waives the right to compel further responses. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (c); 2031.310, subd. (c); 2033.290, subd. (c).)
 
The
motions must also be accompanied by meet and confer declarations (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (b)(1); 2031.310, subd. (b)(2); 2033.290, subd.
(b)(1)), and separate statements (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a)(1), (2),
and (3)). 
 
B. Discussion
 
            Defendant PSIP moves to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to
the following discovery requests: Form Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 1.0, 3.0,
3.2-3.7, 4.2, 12.1-12.6, 14.1-14.2, 15.1, 17.1, 50.1-50.6; Special Interrogatories,
Set One, Nos. 1-630; Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Nos. 1-234;
and Request for Admissions, Set One, Nos. 1-25. 
            In its opposition, Plaintiff submits the declaration of
its counsel, Randy Aguirre, who testifies, among other things, that (1) the
motions could have been avoided if Defendant engaged in a meet and confer
process after the Court granted Defendant’s motion for summary judgment and (2)
“the Court can deny the Motions (or continue them) and decide how to rule on
the Proposed Order Defendant submits, which, presumably will include
Defendant’s proposal that the issues from the MSJ are collateral estoppel on the
Cross-Complaint.” (Opposition, Aguirre Decl., 6.)
            In reply, Defendant argues that it will follow
Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration and submit a proposed order on the motion for
summary judgment stating that Defendant “is entitled to judgment on its
Cross-Complaint ….” (Reply, p. 3:16-18.)
            The Court has reviewed court records and notes that on September
30, 2024, one day before the hearing ion these motions, Drakk finally submitted
its proposed order.  Nevertheless, it
appears that both parties agree that the discovery motions are moot based on
this Court’s order granting Defendant’s motion for summary judgment. 
            Accordingly, the Court’s tentative is to deny the three
motions to compel. Defendant’s request for sanctions is also denied. 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
            The motions to compel further
responses are DENIED. 
 
               Defendant
PSIP
SN Vermont to submit any objection to the exceptionally lengthy proposed order by
October 8, 2024, which should address the mooting of t
