And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the Defendant's motion to set aside the default that was entered on June 7, 2024. The judge found that the default was due to the Defendant's counsel's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The judge also deemed the Answer filed on June 11, 2024, as the operative pleading. The case will continue with the Defendant's Answer being considered. The Plaintiff may file a response to the Answer within 10 days of this ruling.
