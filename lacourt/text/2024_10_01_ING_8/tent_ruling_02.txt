I. BACKGROUND¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A.   
Factual¿¿ 
            Plaintiff Executive Financial
Enterprises, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) alleges that its assignor, United Parcel
Service, Inc. (“UPS”), provided shipping services to Defendant CIS
International Holdings (N.A.) Corp., a California Corporation dba CIS
International Holdings adba Tropical Fish International (“Defendant”). (Compl.,
¶ 6.)
UPS regularly billed Defendant and Defendant promised to pay UPS for those
services. (Compl., ¶ 6.) “Although demand for payment of the sum of
$285,330.30 has been made upon Defendant(s), and each of them, Defendant(s) and
each of them, have failed and refused and continue to fail and refuse to pay
all of any part of said sum. The sum of $285,330.30 remains now due, owing and
unpaid from Defendant to Plaintiff, together with interest thereon at the rate
of 10% per annum from on or after December 26, 2022.” (Compl., ¶ 7.) 
B.   
¿ Procedural 
             
¿           On March 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed this action against
Defendant and Does 1 through 10, inclusive, asserting causes of action for (1)
open book account and (2) account stated. 
 
            On June 7, 2024, default was entered
against Defendant.  On June 11, 2024,
Defendant filed its Answer, which was accepted for filing even though a default
had been entered, evidence that sometimes clerical mistakes occur even in court
filings. 
 
            On August 30, 2024, Defendant filed
a motion to set aside the default. 
 
            On September 5, 2024, Defendant
refiled its motion to set aside the default (the “Motion”), which is seemingly
identical to the one filed on August 30, 2024. 
 
            On September 16, 2024, the Court
held a Case Management Conference (“CMC”). Plaintiff’s counsel and defense
counsel appeared at the CMC. The Court continued the CMC to be on the same date
as the hearing on the Motion on October 1, 2024
 
            No opposition has been filed, nor
has a stipulation to relieve the clerk’s default.

¿III. ANALYSIS¿ 
 
A.   
Legal
Standard
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision
(b), an application for relief must be made no more than six months after entry
of the order from which relief is sought and must be accompanied by an
affidavit of fault attesting to the moving party’s mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 473, subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94
Cal.App.4th 130, 143.)  Application for
this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading
proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted,
and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months,
after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)¿ 
¿ 
“It is the policy of the law to favor, wherever possible, a
hearing on the merits, and appellate courts are much more disposed to affirm an
order where the result is to compel a trial upon the merits than they are when
the judgment by default is allowed to stand and it appears that a substantial
defense could be made. Stated another way, the policy of the law is to have
every litigated case tried upon its merits, and it looks with disfavor upon a
party, who, regardless of the merits of the case, attempts to take advantage of
the mistake, surprise, inadvertence, or neglect of his adversary.”  (Weitz v. Yankosky (1966) 63 Cal.2d
849, 854–855.)¿ 
¿ 
B.   
Discussion
 
As an initial matter, the Court finds the Motion timely as it
was made within six (6) months of the entry of the Clerk’s default on June 6,
2024. 
 
Relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (b) is mandatory when based on an attorney’s affidavit of fault; otherwise,
it is discretionary. (English, 94 Cal.App.4th at 143.) 
 
Here, Defendant has met the attorney affidavit requirement
for mandatory relief. Defense counsel testifies that because the parties
were attempting to resolve the matter informally, she mistakenly believed that
Defendant did not need to respond to the Complaint. (Motion, Declaration of
Sara D. Fazio, ¶¶ 3-7.) Plaintiff has not filed any opposition to the Motion. The
Court finds that Defendant has established that the June 7, 2024, default was
entered due to its counsel’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect.
 
Therefore, the request to vacate the default entered on
June 7, 2024, is GRANTED.¿ 
 
Defendant asks the Court to deem the Answer filed on June 11, 2024,
the operative pleading. That request is also GRANTED. 
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Defendant CIS International Holdings (N.A.) Corp., a
California Corporation dba CIS International Holdings dba Tropical Fish
International’s Motion to Set Aside Default is
GRANTED. The default entered on June 7, 2024, is hereby vacated. Defendant’s operative
Answer is deemed to be the Answer filed on June 11, 2024. Plaintiff Executive
Financial Enterprises, Inc. may file a response to the Answer within 10 days of
this ruling.  
¿ 
            Defendant to give notice.
