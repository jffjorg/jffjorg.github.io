And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike certain paragraphs of the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff had alleged causes of action for battery, assault, false imprisonment, negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. However, the plaintiff failed to plead the basis for punitive damages with the particularity required by the case law. The judge also ruled that the plaintiff failed to plead a statute or contract that would provide a basis for the recovery of attorney's fees. The judge granted the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint within 14 days of notice.
