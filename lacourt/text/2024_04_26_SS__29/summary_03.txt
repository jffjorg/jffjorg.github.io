And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the lawsuit. The plaintiff's counsel made a mistake in filing the case and missing the trial date, leading to the case being dismissed. The judge finds that the plaintiff has established that the dismissal occurred due to counsel's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. The judge orders that the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal is granted, and sets a trial setting conference at the same time. The judge also orders that the plaintiff and/or their counsel shall not be imposed with monetary sanctions in an amount of up to $500 for failure to file a proof of service in approximately 75 days.
