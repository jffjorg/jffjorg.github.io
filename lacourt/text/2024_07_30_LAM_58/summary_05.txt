```

Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint in its entirety, without leave to amend. The demurrer was unopposed, and the Court found that the Plaintiff failed to state a cause of action for breach of contract, assault, battery, negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and wrongful termination and discrimination. The Court found that the Plaintiff's allegations were insufficient to support a claim for breach of contract, and that the attached contract was unclear and lacked consideration. The Court also found that the Plaintiff failed to allege extreme and outrageous conduct by the Defendant to support a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Leave to amend was denied as there was no reasonable possibility of successful amendment.
