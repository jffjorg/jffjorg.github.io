Code., §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.;  Code Civ. Proc., § 372; see Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202  Cal.App.4th 1333, 1337.)  A  petition for court approval of a compromise or covenant not to sue under Code  of Civil Procedure section 372 must comply with California Rules of Court,  rules 7.950, 7.951 and 7.952. The petition must be verified by the petitioner  and contain a full disclosure of all information that has “any bearing upon the  reasonableness” of the compromise or the covenant. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  7.950.)  The  person compromising the claim on behalf of the minor or person who lacks  capacity, and the represented person, must attend the hearing on compromise of  the claim unless the court for good cause dispenses with their personal  appearance. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.952.)  DISCUSSION  Section  12a(1) of the petition states that Plaintiff's medical expenses totaled $649,862.29.  Section 12a(3) of the petition states that  the total amount of medical expenses has been reduced by $12,998.14 as the  result of negotiated, statutory, or contractual reductions.  The petition includes a letter from the  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services documenting the $12,998.14  reduction.  Sections  12a(2) and 12b(2) of the petition state that private health insurance or a  self-funded plan paid $621,636.76 of the medical expenses and the plan does not  request reimbursement.  However, the  Court could not locate any letter or other document from a private health  insurance company or self-funded plan agreeing to waive its right to  reimbursement of $621,636.76 from the settlement proceeds.  Petitioner should include this documentation in  the petition and/or direct the Court’s attention to where it is contained in  the petition.  In  addition, the petition does not include the attorney-client retainer agreement.   The petition includes only an addendum  to the agreement.  The  Court denies the petition without prejudice.  CONCLUSION            The Court DENIES without prejudice the petition to  compromise the claims of Plaintiff Elena Sanchez Galvez filed by Petitioner  Hector Ramos on November 3, 2023.Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal (Settlement) is continued to 4/23/2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 28, Spring Street Courthouse.Petitioner  is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Petitioner  is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within  five days.
