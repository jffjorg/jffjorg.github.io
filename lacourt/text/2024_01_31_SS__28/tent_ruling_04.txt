BACKGROUND 
On
June 1, 2021, Plaintiff Jesunita Agasang (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Nasreen Babu-Khan (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 for
negligence. 
On
January 27, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
December 22, 2023, the Court granted in part Defendant’s ex parte application
to continue the trial and related dates. 
The Court continued the trial from February 6, 2024 to June 5, 2024 but
denied without prejudice Defendant’s request to continue or reopen discovery and
related pre-trial dates. 
On
January 5, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to reopen discovery to be heard on
January 31, 2024.  On January 16, 2024, Defendant filed a supplemental
declaration.  Plaintiff has not filed an
opposition. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for June 5, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Defendant
requests that the Court reopen discovery to correspond with the current trial
date. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2024.020 provides: 
“(a) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any
party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery proceedings
on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery heard on or
before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of the action. 
“(b) Except as provided in Section 2024.050, a
continuance or postponement of the trial date does not operate to reopen
discovery proceedings.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2024.050 provides: 
“(a) On motion of any party, the court may grant leave
to complete discovery proceedings, or to have a motion concerning discovery
heard, closer to the initial trial date, or to reopen discovery after a new
trial date has been set. This motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040. 
“(b) In exercising its discretion to grant or deny
this motion, the court shall take into consideration any matter relevant to the
leave requested, including, but not limited to, the following: 
“(1) The necessity and the reasons for the discovery. 
“(2) The diligence or lack of diligence of the party
seeking the discovery or the hearing of a discovery motion, and the reasons
that the discovery was not completed or that the discovery motion was not heard
earlier. 
“(3) Any likelihood that permitting the discovery or
hearing the discovery motion will prevent the case from going to trial on the
date set, or otherwise interfere with the trial calendar, or result in prejudice
to any other party. 
“(4) The length of time that has elapsed between any date
previously set, and the date presently set, for the trial of the action. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to extend or to reopen
discovery, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2024.050.) 
DISCUSSION                   
Defendant
asks the Court to reopen discovery because Defendant needs to complete
discovery concerning Plaintiff’s medical condition and treatment. 
The
Court has considered the factors listed in Code of Civil Procedure section
2024.050 and grants the motion to reopen discovery. 
Discovery
is reopened.  Discovery and related
deadlines will be based on the June 5, 2024 trial date.    
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Defendant Nasreen Babu-Khan’s motion to
reopen discovery.  Discovery is reopened.  Discovery and related deadlines will be based
on the June 5, 2024 trial date. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
