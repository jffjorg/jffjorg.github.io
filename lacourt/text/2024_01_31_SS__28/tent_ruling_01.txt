PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court tax $14,938.76 of the $15,017.98 costs the City has
requested in its memorandum of costs. 
The
City asks the Court to tax its costs in an amount no greater than $6,734.21 and
award the City $8,283.77 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
The
trial court retains jurisdiction to award or tax costs after an appeal is
taken.  (See Bankes v. Lucas (1992)
9 Cal.App.4th 365, 369 [“filing of a notice of appeal does not stay any
proceedings to determine the matter of costs”], superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in Lee v. Wells
Fargo Bank (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 1187, 1197.) 
“Except
as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a
matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).) 
“A
prevailing party who claims costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs
within 15 days after the date of service of the notice of entry of judgment or
dismissal by the clerk under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5 or the date
of service of written notice of entry of judgment or dismissal, or within 180
days after entry of judgment, whichever is first. The memorandum of costs must
be verified by a statement of the party, attorney, or agent that to the best of
his or her knowledge the items of cost are correct and were necessarily
incurred in the case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivisions (a) and (b), list recoverable
and non-recoverable costs.  Subdivision
(c) of the statute provides in part: 
“An award of costs shall be subject to the following: 
“(1) Costs are allowable if incurred, whether or not
paid. 
“(2) Allowable costs shall be reasonably necessary to
the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to
its preparation. 
“(3) Allowable costs shall be reasonable in amount. 
“(4) Items not mentioned in this section and items
assessed upon application may be allowed or denied in the court’s discretion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5,
subds. (c)(1) - (c)(4).) 
“The
losing party may dispute any or all of the items in the prevailing party’s
costs memorandum by a motion to strike or tax costs.”  (R. Fairbanks et al., Cal. Practice Guide:
Civil Trials and Evidence (Rutter 2022) ¶ 17:517, p. 17-94.)  “If the items [in the memorandum of costs]
appear on their face to be proper charges, the verified memorandum of costs is
prima facie evidence of their propriety, and the burden is on the party seeking
to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.”  (Id., ¶ 17:526, p. 17-96.)  “On the other hand, items that are properly
objected to are put in issue, and the burden of proof is on the party claiming
them as costs.”  (Ibid.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Filing and motion fees 
Plaintiff
challenges the City’s request for $168.91 in costs for filing and motion fees, arguing
the City failed to identify each filing for which it is seeking filing and motion
fees and establish those filings were necessary.  Plaintiff acknowledges that the City filed
numerous motions but asserts that several were not necessary and the City
should not recover fees for unnecessary or failed motions. 
In its
opposition, the City lists three motions for which it is seeking $102.43 in costs for filing
and motion fees and provides evidentiary support.  The City has withdrawn its request for the
remaining $66.48.  The City has carried
its burden of proving entitlement to $102.43 in costs for filing and motion
fees.  The Court taxes $66.48 and denies Plaintiff's motion to tax the remaining $102.43 in costs.  
B.   Deposition costs 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to tax the City’s request for $6,137.00 in deposition costs
because the City did not identify the deponents and how they related to the
proceedings.  In addition, Plaintiff
asserts that one of the City’s witnesses failed to appear for deposition and
another deposition had to be rescheduled due to the City’s counsel’s scheduling
conflict. 
The
City’s opposition lists the depositions and transcript for which the City is
seeking costs, explains the reasons for taking the depositions, and provides
evidentiary support.   
The
City also lists $650.00 in costs for fees caused by the late cancellation of Los
Angeles Sheriff’s Deputy Arthur Penate’s deposition as a result of his need to
reschedule.  According to the City, Deputy
Penate was the officer who investigated Plaintiff’s motor vehicle accident and
the costs were necessarily incurred for the litigation and could not be avoided
due to the lateness of Deputy Penate’s cancellation.  (Bordin-Wosk Decl., ¶ 10 & exh. 8.) 
Plaintiff
responds that she should not have to pay $650.00 based on Deputy Penate’s late
cancellation because the deputy was the City’s witness, the City did not
provide a certificate of non-appearance, and the City should have coordinated
with Deputy Penate to confirm his appearance at the deposition. 
The
City has not carried its burden of proving that $650.00 in costs for Deputy Penate’s
cancelled deposition was reasonable and necessary.  The Court taxes this amount.  The Court finds that the City has carried its
burden of proving entitlement to the remaining $5,487.00 in costs for depositions
and denies Plaintiff’s motion to tax this amount.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(3).) 
C.   Service of process 
Plaintiff
argues that the City has not explained why it incurred $403.10 in costs for
service of process. 
Although
the City does not expressly withdraw its request for $403.10 in costs for
service of process, it does not respond to Plaintiff’s argument that the
request is improper.  The Court grants
Plaintiff’s motion to tax this amount. 
D.   Subpoenaed records/production 
Plaintiff
challenges the City’s request for $1,902.64 in costs for “Subpoenaed
Records/Production.”  Plaintiff argues
that the City does not identify the records or explain how they were reasonably
necessary for the litigation. 
In
its opposition, the City argues that the costs associated with obtaining
subpoenaed records, including the cost of photocopying those records, are recoverable
as costs.  (See Naser v. Lakeridge
Athletic Club (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 571, 577-578 [cost of photocopying plaintiff’s
medical records was recoverable as deposition cost because records were
relevant to plaintiff’s personal injury claim].)  The City withdraws $407.10 of these costs, describes the basis for the remaining $1,495.54 in costs that it is requesting, and provides
evidentiary support. 
The
Court finds that the City has carried its burden of showing $1,495.54 in costs
are recoverable for subpoenaed records/production.  The Court taxes $407.10 in costs and denies the motion to tax the remaining $1,495.54 in costs. 
E.   Investigation and expert fees 
The
City agrees with Plaintiff that the Court may tax this item of costs in the
amount of $6,327.11 (the amount requested in the memorandum of costs).  The Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to tax
this amount. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court
GRANTS IN PART Plaintiff Gloria Edel’s motion to tax costs and taxes Defendant
City of West Hollywood’s costs in the amount of $7,853.79.  In all other respects, the Court DENIES the
motion. 
The
Court awards Defendant City of West Hollywood $7,164.19 in costs. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
