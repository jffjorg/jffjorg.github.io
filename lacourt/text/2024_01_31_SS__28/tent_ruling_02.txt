 Case Number:  20STCV03156    Hearing Date:   January 31, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment, the Court
rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
January 24, 2020, Plaintiff Ignacio Escalante (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendant Daniel Canizales (“Defendant”) for assault, battery, and
intentional infliction of emotional distress.  Plaintiff alleged that Defendant shot him several times in the head without provocation.  According to Plaintiff, Defendant is currently serving a prison term for the shooting. 
On
July 7, 2022, Plaintiff submitted a request for default. A statement was
damages was attached to the request with a proof of service showing service on
June 14, 2023 at the hospital facility in Susanville where Defendant was
incarcerated. The clerk entered Defendant’s default the same day. 
On
September 1, 2022, Defendant wrote the Court from his place of incarceration
asking for an extension of time to file his answer. On September 13, 2022,
Defendant filed an answer. Defendant has not filed a request to vacate the
default. 
On
December 23, 2022, the Court denied Plaintiff’s request for default judgment
because Plaintiff did not provide adequate evidence to support the request for
over $4.5 million in damages. 
On
March 13, 2023, May 15, 2023, and September 26, 2023, the Court denied
Plaintiff’s requests for default judgment due to defects in the applications. 
On December 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a request for court
judgment. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court enter default judgment against Defendant and award
Plaintiff $1,125,558.91, consisting of $125,279.24 in special damages ($100,000
for lost wages and $25,279.24 in medical expenses),
$1,000,000.00 in general damages, and $279.68 in costs.
LEGAL STANDARD 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties and
the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2)  Declarations
or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal
of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for
separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section
579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
          “Where a cause of action is stated in the complaint,
plaintiff merely needs to introduce evidence establishing a prima facie case
for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow,
Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal. Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361
[trial court erred in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
          The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a
defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or, for
personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494 (Becker).) The statute insures that “defendants in cases
which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may
be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is
demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in
court—a right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p.
493.) A trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of
the amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at
p. 494; see Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure, supra,
¶ 5:258, p. 5-70.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
requests $25,279.24 in medical damages based on the amount Medi-Cal paid for
his injuries.  The April 7, 2022 Medi-Cal letter lists $18,959.43 as
the “DHCS Reimbursement Amount” and lists $25,279.24 as “Medi-Cal Paid
Services.” 
According
to Plaintiff, “While Medi-Cal is only requesting reimbursement from Mr.
Escalante in the amount of $18,959.43, this is a statutory reduction for the
DHCS’s portion of Plaintiff’s attorney’s fees pursuant to Welf. & Inst.
Code § 14124.72(d) and is not a reduction in the amount that the DHCS
reasonably paid for the services.”  (Amended
Statement of the Case p. 6.)  Welfare and
Institutions Code section 14124.72, subdivision (d), provides: 
“The director’s claim for reimbursement of the
benefits provided to the beneficiary shall be limited to the amount of the
director’s lien, as defined in subdivision (d) of Section 14124.70.  If the action or claim is brought by the
beneficiary alone and the beneficiary incurs a personal liability to pay
attorney’s fees and costs of litigation, the amount of the director’s lien that
is reimbursed shall be reduced by 25 percent, which represents the director’s
reasonable share of attorney’s fees paid by the beneficiary, and that portion
of the cost of litigation expenses determined by multiplying the actual
litigation expenses by the ratio of the amount reimbursed to the director as
satisfaction of the director’s lien, prior to deducting reasonable attorney’s
fees and litigation expenses, to the full amount of the settlement, judgment,
or award.” 
(Welf. & Inst. Code, §
14124.72, subd. (d).) 
 Plaintiff’s counsel states: 
“While the DHCS has only requested reimbursement in
the amount of $18,959.43, this lower amount is not the contractually negotiated
amount that the DHCS reasonably paid for Mr. Escalante’s medical services and
does not change the recovery of the full amount of services paid under Howell
v. Hamilton Meats & Provisions, Inc. (2011) 52 Cal.4th 541. Instead, it
reflects a twenty five percent (25%) reduction in what the DHCS is permitted to
recover from Mr. Escalante pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section
14124.72(d), which represents the DHCS’s reasonable share of attorney’s fees
paid by Mr. Escalante in pursuing this action. Welf. & Inst. Code §
14124.72(d) (“If the action or claim is brought by the beneficiary alone and
the beneficiary incurs a personal liability to pay attorney’s fees and costs of
litigation, the amount of the director’s lien that is reimbursed shall be
reduced by 25 percent, which represents the director’s reasonable share of
attorney’s fees paid by the beneficiary, . . .”) In other words, the $25,279.24
expended by the DHCS is what it actually paid for the services provided, not
the full amounts that would be charged to a person who was not covered by
Medi-Cal, and the $18,959.43 reimbursement amount reflects the maximum amount
that the DHCS can recover from Mr. Escalante given that he was forced to incur
attorney fees to recover for these expenses, it is not the difference between
what the provider charged and what the DHCS actually paid.” 
(Henriks Decl. ¶ 6.) 
“Plaintiff
is entitled to recover the ‘reasonable cost’ of past medical care necessitated
by the defendant’s tortious conduct. 
However, the fundamental purpose of compensatory damages is to make
plaintiff ‘whole’ – not to bestow a ‘profit’ or ‘windfall’ [citation
omitted].  Hence, ‘reasonable’
compensation for past medical expenses may not exceed the amount actually paid
or incurred – whether by the plaintiff directly or by private insurance,
Medi-Cal, Medicare, plaintiff’s employer or any other ‘collateral source.’
”  (Z. Haning et al., Cal. Practice
Guide: Personal Injury (Rutter 2022) ¶ 3:352, p. 3-59 (Cal. Practice Guide:
PI), emphasis omitted.) 
“Where
plaintiff’s medical insurer negotiates an amount less than the medical
provider’s ordinary rates, plaintiff may not recover the ‘negotiated amount
differential.’  This is so even if the
full or ordinary rates arguably represent the ‘reasonable value’ of the medical
services:  ‘Having never incurred the
full bill, plaintiff could not recover it in damages for economic loss.’ “  (Cal. Practice Guide: PI, supra, ¶
3:353, p. 3-59, quoting Howell v. Hamilton Meats & Provisions, Inc.
(2011) 52 Cal.4th 541, 560-561 [plaintiff not entitled to $189,979 ‘reasonable
value’ of the services rendered by medical providers who accepted $59,692 under
agreement with plaintiff’s insurer].) 
The
Court accepts Plaintiff’s explanation for requesting $25,279.24 in medical
expenses. 
Plaintiff
has addressed the other concerns raised in the Court’s previous orders.  The Court grants the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Ignacio Escalante’s application for default judgment
filed on December 5, 2023 and enters judgment against Defendant Daniel Canizales for $1,125,558.92. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
