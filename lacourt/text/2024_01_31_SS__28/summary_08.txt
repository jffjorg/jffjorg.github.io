The judge has considered the motion for determination of good faith settlement and has found that the settlement between Plaintiff Krystelle Lumantas and Defendant Berlin Verali Marroquin was made in good faith. The settlement amount is $15,000.00, which exceeds the known special damages of $14,951.39. The judge has also considered the Tech-Bilt factors, including the rough approximation of the plaintiff's total recovery and the settlor's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of settling defendants. The judge has found that the settlement was made in good faith and grants the motion. The court dismisses all pending and future claims against Defendant Berlin Verali Marroquin by the parties served with this motion.
