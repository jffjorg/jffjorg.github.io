The tentative ruling is regarding a motion to quash deposition subpoenas filed by defendants Gayle Hooks, Christopher Hooks, and Kama Ashley. The subpoenas were issued by plaintiff Yasam Legacy, LLC, seeking business records from Southern California Gas Company and Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. The court denied the motions without prejudice, stating that the defendants failed to meet and confer with the plaintiff to attempt to informally resolve the discovery issues, and also failed to schedule an Informal Discovery Conference with the court. The court ordered the defendants to comply with the department's rules and to renew their motions once they have done so.
