  order RE:
  DefendanTs gayle hooks, 
  christopher hooks AND KAMA 
  ASHLEY’S MOTIONs TO QUASH 
  PLAINTIFF YASAM LEGACY’S THIRD 
  PARTY DEPOSITION SUBPOENAS TO 
  SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS 
  COMPANY AND LOS ANGELES 
  DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER
 
 
 



 
Defendants Gayle Hooks, Christopher Hooks and
Kama Ashely have filed two motions to quash Plaintiff Yasam Legacy’s deposition
subpoenas for production of business records to Southern California Gas Company
and Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.
This Department’s rules require the parties
to first meet and confer to attempt to informally resolve all discovery
issues.  Defendants’ motions are not
accompanied by a declaration setting forth the parties’ attempts to meet and
confer on the issues raised in the motions to quash.  
Additionally, if the parties cannot agree, they
are to schedule an Informal Discovery Conference with the Court.  No IDC was scheduled.
Accordingly, the Court denies Defendants’
motions to quash without prejudice to a renewal of the motions once Defendants
have complied with this Department’s rules. 

 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
