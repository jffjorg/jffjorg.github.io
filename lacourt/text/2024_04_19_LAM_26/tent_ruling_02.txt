 Case No.: 23STCV05706 
 
 Hearing Date: April 19, 2024
 
[TENTATIVE] order RE:
Defense counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel
 



 
Background
            GD
Services (Plaintiff) is an Alaskan company that was hired by High Times
Productions, Inc. (Defendant) to provide services at a conference in 2020.
After Plaintiff provided the requested services, Defendant refused to pay.
Plaintiff then filed suit for breach of contract and fraud. The motion now
before the Court is Defense Counsel’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel (Motion).  
 
Legal Standard
            An application to be relieved as
counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and
Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1362(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule
3.1362(e)). The
proposed order must specify all hearing dates scheduled in the action or
proceeding,
including the date of trial, if known. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).)
            Further, the requisite forms must be
served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay the effective date of the order
relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client
has been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) A motion
to withdraw will not be granted where withdrawal would prejudice the client. (Ramirez
v. Sturdevant (1994), 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
Discussion
            Defense
counsel has met all the necessary requirements to grant the Motion. Counsel has
filed both forms MC-051 and MC-052. Additionally, form MC-052 denotes all
upcoming hearings, including the June 5, 2024 Continued Trial Setting
Conference. Trial has not been set, and the client has been notified (see Proof
of Service filed on March 25, 2024). Finally, Defense counsel notes in the
Amended MC-052, that counsel and client have irreconcilable differences as the
reason for the Motion.
Conclusion and ORDER
            Accordingly, Defense Counsel’s
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED.  Counsel is not relieved as counsel of record
until Counsel serves the Order on his client and all parties and files proof of
same with the Court.
            Moving Party to give notice.
