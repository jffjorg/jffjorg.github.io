And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling by Judge Yolanda Orozco addresses a motion by Defense Counsel to be relieved as counsel in the case between GD SERVICES COMPANY (Plaintiff) and HIGH TIMES PRODUCTIONS, INC. (Defendant). The Plaintiff had provided services at a conference in 2020 but the Defendant refused to pay, leading to a lawsuit for breach of contract and fraud. The Defense Counsel has met all the necessary requirements to grant the motion, including filing the required forms and serving the client and all parties. The Judge grants the motion, but notes that Counsel is not relieved as counsel of record until the Order is served on the client and all parties and proof of service is filed with the court.
