below.      
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
 
On 9/14/23, Alal, LLC dba Kei-Ai Los Angeles Healthcare
Center (Kei-Ai) filed its complaint against Jim Rey (Jim Rey) and Blenda Rey
(Blenda Ray) (collectively, the Reys), two of Kei-Ai’s former management
employees, for: (1) Breach of Duty of Loyalty, (2) Fraud, (3) Constructive
Fraud, (4) Interference With Contract, (5) Conversion, (6) Unfair Competition
and (7) Receipt of Stolen Property.  
 
On 10/27/23, the Reys filed a cross-complaint and an
answer which was attached to the cross-complaint and re-filed on 2/16/24.  The cross-complaint alleged causes of action
against Kei-Ai for: (1) Retaliation in Violation of Labor Code 1102.5, (2)
Wrongful Discharge in Violation of Public Policy, (3) Racial Retaliation in
Violation of FEHA 12940(h), (4) Failure to Prevent Harassment, Discrimination,
Retaliation and (5) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.  After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve
the issues Kei-Ai had with the cross-complaint, on 11/27/23, Kei-Ai filed and
served a demurrer to the 4th and 5th causes of action in
the Reys’ cross-complaint.  The Reys
opposed the demurrer and Kei-Ai filed a reply to the opposition.  
On 1/18/24, the Court sustained Kei-Ai’s demurrer with 30
days leave to amend.  (See 1/18/24
Minute Order).
 
On 2/16/24, the Reys filed and served a First Amended
Cross-Complaint.  After the Reys’ counsel
failed to respond to Kei-Ai’s counsel’s meet and confer efforts regarding the
First Amended Cross-Complaint, on 3/14/24, Kei-Ai filed and served a demurrer
to the 4th and 5th causes of action in the First Amended
Cross-Complaint.  The Reys opposed the
demurrer and Kei-Ai filed a reply to the opposition.  On 5/13/24, the Court sustained the demurrer
without leave to amend.  (See
5/13/24 Minute Order).  On 6/10/24,
Kei-Ai answered the First Amended Cross-Complaint.  
 
On 11/14/23, Kei-Ai served Jim Rey and Blenda Rey,
separately, with Requests for Production, Set 1.  (Silva Decl. ¶3, Ex.3).  The Reys each served untimely responses on
1/17/24 and served a total of four pages of responsive documents.  (Id., Ex.4).  Kei-Ai found many of the responses to be
deficient.  (Silva Decl. ¶4).  The Reys failed to respond to Kei-Ai’s
1/25/24 meet and confer letter.  (Silva
Decl. ¶¶4-5, Ex.5).  
 
Therefore, on 2/16/24, Kei-Ai filed and served the
instant motion seeking an order compelling 
Blenda Rey to provide further responses to Requests for Production, Set
1, numbers 1-17 and 20-103, served by Kei-Ai. 
Additionally, Kei-Ai requests an award of sanctions in the amount of
$1,750.00 against Blenda Rey.  Blenda Rey
has not opposed or otherwise responded to the motion.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
A response to a document request must contain at least one
of the following: (1) a statement that the party will comply with the
particular demand for inspection … by the date set for the inspection; (2) a
representation that the party lacks the ability to comply with the demand for
inspection; or (3) an objection to the particular demand for inspection.  See CCP
2031.210.
 
To the extent a responding party produces documents in
response to a request, the production must be identified with the specific
request number to which the documents respond. 
See CCP 2031.280(a).

 
To the extent a responding party claims inability to
comply with a request, the responding party must “affirm that a diligent search
and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with that
demand,” and must further “specify whether the inability to comply is because
the particular item or category has never existed, has been destroyed, has been
lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the
possession, custody, or control of the responding party.”  See CCP 2031.230.
 
A party may move to compel further responses to document
requests if it deems: (1) a statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete, (2) a representation of inability to comply is inadequate,
incomplete, or evasive; and/or (3) an objection in the response is without
merit or too general.  See CCP
2031.310(a).  
 
In response to Requests 1, 2 and 9, Blenda Rey responded
with “[p]lease see attached” which is deficient because it does not comply with
the requirements of CCP 2031.210. 
Additionally, Blenda Rey failed to identify the documents produced as
required by CCP 2031.280(a).
 
In response to Requests 3-8, 10-15, 21-27, 29 and 31, Blenda
Rey stated that she lacks the ability “to fully comply” with the requests
because at the time, “the requested documents do not exist.”  Such responses do not satisfy the
requirements of CCP 2031.320 regarding an inability to comply with a document
request as it cannot be determined why the documents do not exist or if they
ever existed.  
 
In response to Requests 16-17, 20-22, 30 and 32-102, Blenda
Rey also stated that she lacked the ability to comply with the requests because
she was “still attempting to gather the requested documents.”  Such a response is not code-compliant.  Additionally, it has now been approximately
nine months since the document requests were served and Blenda Rey has failed
to supplement her responses.  
 
Similarly, Blenda Rey has not provided a code-compliant
response to Requests 28.  Blenda Rey is
required to determine whether she has any documents responsive to the
request.  
 
Blenda Rey failed to provide any response to Request 103,
therefore, Kei-Ai is entitled to a response. 

 
Kei-Ai is entitled to sanctions against Blenda Rey for her
failure to comply with her discovery obligations.  CCP 2023.010(f); CCP 2031.310(h).  Kei-Ai is awarded $1,000.00 in sanctions
against Blenda Rey calculated as follows: 1.25 hours to prepare motion at
$300/hour + .75 hour to review motion at $500/hour + .5 hour to appear at the
hearing.  (See Silva Decl. ¶¶6-9).
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
Blenda Rey is ordered to provide further, verified responses to Requests
for Production, Set 1, numbers 1-17 and 20-103, and to produce responsive
documents within 30 days.  Sanctions are
imposed on Blenda Rey in the amount of $1,000.00, payable within 30 days.
