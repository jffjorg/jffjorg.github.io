    BACKGROUND   On May 24, 2022, Arbitrator Kathy  Vodges, Esq. issued an arbitration award in the amount of $25,000 for  Petitioners Michael Sanders (“Sanders”) and Trisha Atkinson (“Atkinson”) and  against Respondents Oren Badler (“Balder”) and OB Floors, Inc. (“OB”),  (collectively “Respondents”).  (Pet. pp. 7-11;  Pet. ¶¶ 6-8.)   On March 1, 2023, Petitioners, in propria persona, filed  the instant Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award (“Petition”) against  Respondents.               On June 16, 2023, Petitioner Sanders  filed a Request to Postpone Trial in the form of a sworn declaration,  indicating that he had “to travel out of the country to act as a personal  caregiver and power of attorney for an ailing parent.”  (6-16-23 Request to Postpone Trial.)               On June 27, 2023, Petitioner Sanders  filed proofs of personal service on Oren Badler for the Request for  Postponement.               On July 5, 2023, the Court noted  that the Petition listed the Van Nuys Courthouse East address, instead of the  address for the Spring Street Courthouse.   (7-5-23 Minute Order.)  Pursuant  to the request of Petitioner Sanders (erroneously requesting continuance of  trial rather than the hearing), the Court continued the hearing to August 16,  2023, and ordered the moving party to give notice.  (Ibid.)               On August 16, 2023, the Court  continued the hearing on the Petition because there was no indication that  Petitioner had served Respondents with a notice of continuance.  (8-16-23 Minute Order.)  The Court gave notice to Petitioner Sanders  and Respondent Badler.  (8-16-23  Certificate of Mailing.)               On September 18, 2023, the Court  continued the hearing on the Petition to October 24, 2023, so that a legible  copy of the Home Improvement Contract could be submitted.  The court also noted that Petitioner had not  presented evidence that a neutral arbitrator served a copy of the Award on the  parties. Petitioners were ordered to give notice.  Petitioners failed to file proof that notice  of the continuance was served on Respondents.      No opposition has been filed.   PETITIONER’S  POSITION               Petitioners  move to confirm the arbitration award they obtained against Respondents on May 24,  2022 and enter judgment thereon.   Petitioners hired Respondents to perform renovations on their home.  Petitioners claimed in arbitration that  Respondents’ work was substandard.   Petitioners filed their arbitration claim against Respondents pursuant  to the arbitration clause contained in the parties’ Home Improvement  Contract.  On May 24, 2022, Arbitrator  Kathy Vogdes issued a final award in Petitioners’ favor in the amount of  $25,000.     OPPOSITION               No response  to the petition was filed.     REPLY               No reply  was filed.     ANALYSIS   I.  Applicable Law               “Any party to an arbitration which an award has been made  may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.”  CCP §1285.   “A petition under this chapter shall:   (a) set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement  to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of such an agreement.  (b) Set forth the names of the arbitrators. (c) Set forth or have attached a  copy of the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.”  CCP §1285.4.                “If a petition or response  under this chapter is duly served and filed, the court shall confirm the award  as made, whether rendered in this state or another state, unless in accordance  with this chapter it corrects the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates  the award or dismisses the proceeding.” CCP §1286.               Once  arbitration is concluded, “any arbitrator’s award is enforceable only when  confirmed as a judgment of the superior court.”   (O’Hare v. Municipal Resource Consultants (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th  267, 278.).  Any of the parties may file  a petition with the court, which must then “confirm the award, correct and  confirm it, vacate it, or dismiss the petition.”  (Code of Civil Proc. §§ 1285, 1286; EHM  Productions, Inc. v. Starline Tours of Hollywood, Inc. (2018) 21  Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.)  “It is well  settled that the scope of judicial review of arbitration awards is extremely  narrow.”  (California Faculty Assn. v.  Superior Court (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 935, 943.)  “Neither the trial court, nor the appellate  court, may ‘review the merits of the dispute, the sufficiency of the evidence,  or the arbitrator’s reasoning, nor may we correct or review an award because of  an arbitrator’s legal or factual error, even if it appears on the award’s  face.”  (EHM Productions, supra,  at p. 1063-64.)   II.  Application to  Facts               Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure  § 1290.4, a petition to confirm arbitration must be served as follows:     “(a) A copy  of the petition and a written notice of the time and place of the hearing  thereof and any other papers upon which the petition is based shall be served  in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for the service of such  petition and notice.    (b) If the  arbitration agreement does not provide the manner in which such service shall  be made and the person upon whom service is to be made has not previously  appeared in the proceeding and has not previously been served in accordance  with this subdivision: ¶ (1) Service within this State shall be made in the  manner provided by law for the service of summons in an action.”               In prior tentative rulings, the  Court stated that Petitioners satisfied the service requirement by personally  serving the Notice of Hearing and Petition on June 27, 2023.  However, based on a review of the file, two  proofs of service were filed on June 27, 2023 evidencing personal  service as follows:   (1)  Proof of Service for Job 8568106:  (1) Person served:  Oren Badler; (2) Manner of Service:  Personal on March 19, 2023; (3) Documents:  “ADR-106, Court Filing.pdf, Notice of Case  Assignment Superior Court.pdf, Notice of hearing.pdf, superiorcourt.pdf,  picture of Oren.pdf.”   (2)  Proof of Service for Job 9057910:  (1) Person served:  Oren Badler; (2) Manner of Service: Personal  on June 21, 2023; (3) Documents:  “Superior  Court of the State of California County of Los Angeles-Request for  Postponement.”                 Petitioner’s June 27, 2023 Proofs of  Service do not satisfy the service requirement under CCP §1290.4 as to  Respondents for the following reasons:     (1) Neither  proof of service clearly indicates that the Petition to Confirm Arbitration  Award was served on Oren Badler;   (2) Neither  proof of service indicates service on Respondent OB Floors, Inc. or that  service on Oren Badler was on behalf of OB Floors, Inc., a corporation.                 Respondents have not responded to  the petition.  Thus, Respondents have not  waived the notice requirements.                            In addition, OB Floors, Inc. remains  a named respondent.  Petitioners have not  dismissed it as a respondent, nor have they indicated that they intend to  dismiss it as a respondent.               As such, Petitioner’s petition  cannot be granted until proper proof of service on both Respondents of  the Notice, the Petition and any updated Notice of Hearing on the Petition.  Service must comply with CCP §1290.4, i.e.,  service as agreed to in the arbitration agreement or if no method of service is  provided for in the arbitration agreement, service in the manner of a complaint  and summons.                 Finally, pursuant to CCP §1283.6,  “the neutral arbitrator shall serve a signed copy of the award on each party to  the arbitration personally or by registered or certified mail or as provided in  the agreement.”  Petitioners represented  in Item 9(a) of the Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award that “the signed  award or accompanying document indicates that the award was served on  petitioner on May 24, 2022.”  (Petition,  Item 9(a), p. 2.)  However, there is no  indication in the attached copy of the award that it was ever served on  Respondents.  (Id. at Attachment  8(c).  Petitioners must provide proof  that the arbitration award was served by the arbitrator on the Respondents in  accordance with CCP §1283.6.                 Hearing on Petitioners’ Petition to  Confirm Arbitration Award is CONTINUED TO NOVEMBER 30, 2023 AT 10:00 A.M.  IN DEPARTMENT 25 OF THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. Petitioners must file proof of service of  Notice of Hearing on the Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award and the Petition  to Confirm Arbitration Award on both Respondents.  Petitioners must also provide proof that the  arbitrator served the Final Arbitration Award on Respondents in accordance with  CCP §1283.6.  At least 16 court days before the next scheduled hearing,
Petitioners must serve and file supplemental
papers addressing the errors discussed herein. 
Failure to do so may result in the Application being placed off calendar
or denied.
