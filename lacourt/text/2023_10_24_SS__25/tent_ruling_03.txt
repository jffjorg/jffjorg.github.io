    BACKGROUND   On March 29, 2022,  Plaintiff/Appellant RSA Talent Management, LLC (“RSA”) filed a Notice of Appeal from an Order of the  Labor Commissioner awarding $3,653.75 in wages, waiting time penalties, and interest to  Defendant/Appellee Dominic Friesen (“Friesen”).   On September 13, 2022, the Court  denied Appellee Friesen’s Motion to Dismiss the Appeal of the Order, Decision or Award of  the Labor Commissioner Based on Unrepresented LLC filed on August 17, 2022. (9-13-22 Minute  Order.)   On December 14, 2022, the Court  ordered the case to be reclassified as a limited case; the case was reassigned to Department 25 at  the Spring Street Courthouse. (12-14-22 Minute Order; 12-30-22 Minute Order.)   On May 19, 2023, Appellee Friesen  filed the instant Motion to Compel Depositions of RSA’s Managing Partners Brenda Fisher  and Gina Nuccio, Production of Documents, and Request for Sanctions (“Motion”). The Court,  on its own motion, continued the hearing to August 10, 2023. (6-6-23 Minute  Order; 7-6-23 Minute Order.) On June 9, 2023, Appellee Friesen filed a Supplemental Declaration of Abdel  Nassar in Support of the Motion.   On August 10, 2023, the Court  heard the motion and continued the hearing on the motion to allow Appellee  Friesen to comply with Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.450(b)(1), specifically  to “set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production of  inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible  thing described in the deposition notice.”    On September 1, 2023, Appellee  filed an additional Supplemental Declaration putting forth facts showing good  cause for the production of documents.  ANALYSIS  I.                    Legal Standard  Code of  Civil Procedure § 2025.450(a) provides: “If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an  officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person  designated by an organization that is a party under Section  2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails  to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection  any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in  the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order  compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for  inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible  thing described in the deposition notice.” The motion  shall “(1) set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the  production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,  or tangible thing described in the deposition notice” and “(2) be accompanied  by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent  fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored  information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration  stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the  nonappearance.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450(b)(2).) A court  shall impose monetary sanctions in favor of the moving party if the motion to  compel is granted, unless “the one subject to sanction acted with substantial  justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction  unjust. (Code. Civ. Proc., § 2025.450(g)(1).) II.                 Discussion  A.      Motion to Compel  Appellee Dominic Friesen moves for an order compelling the  depositions of Appellant RSA’s Managing Partners Brenda Fisher and Gina Nuccio  and their production, without objections, of documents requested in the Notice  of Deposition served on RSA on April 21, 2023. (Mot. pp. 1- 2.) Appellee also  requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,200 for attorney’s fees and  $550 in court reporter costs incurred on May 17, 2023. (Ibid. at p. 2.)    On April 21, 2023, Appellee Friesen served Appellant RSA  with a Notices of Deposition of RSA’s Managing Partners Brenda Fisher and Gina  Nuccio, scheduled for May 17, 2023. (Nassar Decl. ¶ 16, Ex. 1.) Due to an  inadvertent error, the address listed in the caption of the Notices of  Deposition is incorrect; however, the body of the Notices lists the correct  address where the depositions were to take place. (Ibid.) RSA did not serve any  written objections to the Notices. (Ibid.) On May 15, 2023, Jhonna Lyn Estioko,  Legal Secretary for Friesen’s counsel, called RSA’s counsel to confirm the  depositions scheduled for May 17, 2023; she left a voicemail reiterating the  correct address for the depositions. (Ibid. at ¶ 17; Estioko Decl. ¶ 4.)  Friesen’s counsel also sent an email to RSA’s  attorney to confirm Fisher and Nuccio’s attendance at the depositions. (Ibid.,  Ex. 2.) RSA’s counsel did not respond to the voicemail or email. (Ibid.) Fisher  and Nuccio did not appear at the deposition on May 17, 2023. (Ibid. at ¶ 18, Ex.  3.) Friesen’s counsel again followed up with RSA’s attorney, but did not  receive any response. (Ibid.) On June 9, 2023, Friesen filed the Reporter’s  Certificate of Non-Appearance and invoice for court costs. (Supp. Decl. ¶ 4,  Ex. 4.)   Appellee  Friesen has submitted evidence that Appellant RSA was served with deposition  notices. RSA did not serve a valid objection and its Managing Partners Fisher  and Nuccio did not appear at the deposition noticed for May 17, 2023. Following  RSA’s Managing Partners’ failure to appear at the deposition, Friesen’s counsel  made another attempt to contact RSA’s counsel.   The  supplemental deposition submitted on September 1, 2023 complies with the  requirement set forth in Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.450(b)(1). Counsel  Abdel Nassar declares that there is good cause for the production of documents  requested in the notices of depositions. Mr. Nassar states that Request 1 seeks  any and all partnership agreements between deponents and RSA. Mr, Nassar states  that this production will help Plaintiff understand and/or establish their  roles in RSA, including their roles in setting employment policies. Requests  2-11 seek communications between RSA/Deponents and Plaintiff, time and payroll  records related to Plaintiff, and documents related to services provided by  Plaintiff to RSA’s clients. Mr. Nassar states that there is good cause for  production of these documents because Plaintiff seeks unpaid wages and  penalties that Defendant denies are owed, and these documents will assist  Plaintiff in establishing his claims against RSA or are likely to lead to  relevant evidence. (Nassar Decl. ¶ 3.)    B.     Sanctions     Code  of Civil Procedure § 2023.030(a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court  may impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the  discovery process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,  incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery  process includes failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of  discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010(d).) In addition, a court shall impose  monetary sanctions if a motion to compel a deposition is granted unless “the  one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other  circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code. Civ. Proc. §  2025.450(g)(1).)    Appellee  Friesen requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,200 for attorney’s fees  and $650 in court reporter costs incurred on May 17, 2023. (Nassar Decl. ¶¶  19-23.) Attorney’s fees are calculated as follows: two (2) hours for drafting  the Motion and counsel’s declaration and one (1) hour to prepare for and attend  the hearing, at an hourly rate of $400. (Ibid.) Friesen also seeks $650 for  court reporter fees. (Ibid. at ¶ 23; Supp. Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. 4; 09/01/23 Supp.  Decl. ¶ 4.)    The  Court GRANTS the request for sanctions in the amount of $1,850 against RSA.  III.       Conclusion                The Court grants this motion to  compel RSA Managing Partners Gina Nuccio and Brenda Fisher to attend their  depositions and produce all documents identified in the deposition notices. The  Court also orders monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,850.              RSA Managing Partners Gina Nuccio and Brenda Fisher are  ordered to appear for deposition and produce all documents identified in the  deposition notices within 30 days of this order.              RSA Managing Partners Gina Nuccio  and Brenda Fisher are ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,850  to Appellee Friesen within 30 days of this order.                        Moving party to give notice.
