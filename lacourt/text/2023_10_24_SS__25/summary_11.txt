And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where Petitioner Forward Financing, LLC is seeking to confirm an arbitration award against Respondents Meriad Solutions, Inc. dba The Bissell House Bed and Breakfast and William Hoyman. The arbitration award was issued on March 23, 2023, and the petition to confirm the award was filed on June 20, 2023. The Judge has determined that the petition has satisfied the filing requirements and service requirements, but has not satisfied the requirement of providing proof of service of the arbitration award. As a result, the Judge is continuing the motion to confirm the arbitration award to allow Petitioner to submit proof of service of the award. Petitioner is ordered to file and serve supplemental papers at least 16 court days before the continued hearing, and failure to do so may result in the petition being placed off calendar or denied.
