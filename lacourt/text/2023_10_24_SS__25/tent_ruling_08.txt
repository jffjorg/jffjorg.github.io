ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
On April 26, 2023, Petitioner Seung Ri Jung (“Petitioner”)
filed the instant verified Petition for Release of Property from Mechanic’s Lien
(“Petition”) against Respondent Ken Park (“Respondent” or “Park”).  The Petition seeks an order releasing property
commonly known as 15711 Formby Drive, La Mirada CA 90638 (“Subject Property”)
from a mechanic’s lien filed on September 28, 2022, by Respondent.  (Pet. ¶¶ 1-4, Ex. 1.)
 
On August 28, 2023, the Court, on its own motion,
continued the hearing on the Petition to September 13, 2023.  (8-28-23 Minute Order.)
 
On September 13, 2023, the Court, on its own motion,
continued the hearing to October 24, 2023 to cure service defects identified by
the court. (9-13-23 Minute Order.)
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
II.                
Legal
Standard
 
After a mechanic’s lien has been
recorded, “[t]he owner of property or the owner of any interest in property
subject to a claim of lien may petition the court for an order to release the
property from the claim of lien if the claimant has not commenced an action to
enforce the lien within the time provided in Section 8460.”  (Civ. Code, § 8480(a).)  A claimant must commence an action to enforce
a lien within 90 days of recording the lien, otherwise, “the claim of lien
expires and is unenforceable.”  (Civ.
Code, § 8460(a).)  However, the 90-day
time limit to commence an action to enforce a lien does not apply if there was
an agreement to extend credit and a notice of that fact was recorded within 90
days after recordation of the claim of lien or more than 90 days after
recordation of the claim of lien but before a purchaser or encumbrancer for
value and in good faith acquires rights in the property.  (Civ. Code, § 8460(b).)
 
III.             
Discussion
 
A. Service Requirements
 
“The petitioner shall serve a copy of the petition and a notice of
hearing on the claimant at least 15 days before the hearing.  Service shall be made in the same manner as
service of summons, or by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return
receipt requested, addressed to the claimant as provided in Section 8108.” 
(Civ. Code § 8486(b).)  Civil Code
§ 8108 provides addresses at which a respondent must be served, depending on
the title of the person to be served. 
For example, a claimant should be served at the address on the “claimant’s
contract, preliminary notice, claim of lien, stop payment notice, or claim against a
payment bond, or on the records of the Contractors' State License Board.” 
(Civ. Code § 8108(e).)  The petitioner
bears the burden of proving that he or she complied with service and date for
hearing requirements.  (Civ. Code. § 8488(a).)
 
On June 22, 2023, Petitioner filed Proof of Service of
the Petition, Notice, and supporting documents. 
The Proof of Service indicates that these papers were personally served
on Respondent Park on June 19, 2023, at 7:10 p.m. at 5001 Beach Blvd. #103,
Buena Park, CA 90621.  (6-22-23 Proof of
Service.)  On September 13, 2023,
Petitioner filed the Declaration of Christine Ham, Esq. re Proof of Service of
Respondent Ken Park in Support of Release of Mechanic’s Lien. Ham declared that
the papers were personally served on Respondent Park on June 19, 2023, at 7:10
p.m. at 5001 Beach Blvd. #103, Buena Park, CA 90621. (Dec. Ham, ¶ 2.) However,
the Court cannot verify whether Respondent has been served at the correct
address because the 5001 Beach Blvd. address is not listed in the Claim of
Mechanic’s Lien or any of the other documents submitted by Petitioner. As
discussed above, Respondent needs to be served at the address identified on the
claimant’s contract, preliminary
notice, claim of lien, stop payment notice, or claim against a payment bond, or in
the records of the Contractors' State License Board. The 5001 Beach Blvd. address is not listed
on any of the documents. 
 
Thus, the Court finds that the
service requirements have not been satisfied.
 
B. Petition
Requirements
 
            Civil Code § 8484 requires that the
petition for release order be verified by the petitioner and allege the
following:
 
(a) The date of recordation of the claim of lien. A certified copy of
the claim of lien shall be attached to the petition.
(b) The county in which the claim of lien is recorded.
(c) The book and page or series number of the place in the official
records where the claim of lien is recorded.
(d) The legal description of the property subject to the claim of lien.
(e) Whether an extension of credit has been granted under Section 8460,
if so to what date, and that the time for commencement of an action to enforce
the lien has expired.
(f) That the owner has given the claimant notice under Section 8482
demanding that the claimant execute and record a release of the lien and that
the claimant is unable or unwilling to do so or cannot with reasonable
diligence be found.
(g) Whether an action to enforce the lien is pending.
(h) Whether the owner of the property or interest in the property has
filed for relief in bankruptcy or there is another restraint that prevents the
claimant from commencing an action to enforce the lien.
 
A property owner may not petition for a
release order until he or she gives the claimant notice demanding that the
claimant execute and record a release of lien claim at least ten days before
filing the petition.  (Civ. Code § 8482.)
 
Petitioner states that he is the legal
owner and title holder of the Subject Property located at 15711 Formby Drive,
LA Mirada, CA 90638, with the legal description set forth in the Petition.  (Pet. ¶ 3.)  Around
September 28, 2022, Respondent Park recorded a Mechanic’s Lien against Subject
Property, Document No. 20220945579, and filed it with the Los Angeles County
Recorder’s Office.  (Ibid. at ¶
4.)  A certified copy of the Mechanic’s
Lien is enclosed as Exhibit 1.  (Ibid.,
Ex. 1.)  Petitioner states that
Respondent Park “was not and never was an individual, partner,
president, or employee of the corporation known as R2J Construction, Inc., as
indicated on Respondent’s mechanic’s lien and did not engage in the business of
general contracting or subcontracting.” 
(Ibid. at ¶
5.)  Petitioner has submitted the sworn
declaration of David Ku Jung, “owner, chief executive officer, chief financial
officer, and secretary of R2J Construction, Inc.” who also states that “Ken
Park has never been an officer, president, partner, or director of R2J
Construction, Inc.,” has never been authorized to write estimates for R2J
Construction, and has not been an employee between 2020 and the present.  (Pet. p. 25, Ex. 3.)  Moreover, R2J Construction, Inc. has not
entered into any agreement to perform construction work on the Subject
Property.  (Ibid.)
 
The ninety-day period to enforce the claim of lien
expired on December 27, 2022, and Respondent has not taken any action to
enforce the lien within this period.  (Pet.
¶ 6.)  No extension of credit has been
recorded.  (Ibid.)
 
On November 9, 2022, Petitioner sent Respondent a written
demand requesting that Respondent remove the lien on Subject Property, to
Respondent’s address listed on the claim of lien.  (Pet. ¶ 7, Ex. 2.)  Respondent has not responded to the demand
letter or released the lien.  (Ibid.
at ¶ 8.)  Petitioner has not filed
for relief under any bankruptcy law and there is no other restraint preventing
Respondent from initiating an action on the Lien.  (Ibid. at ¶ 9.)
 
The Court finds that Petitioner has satisfied most of the
requirements for the instant Petition. 
However, given that the Court cannot verify whether Respondent has been
properly served with the Petition and Notice at the right address, the Court
continues the hearing on the Petition. 
Petitioner is ordered to file supplemental papers showing that
Respondent has been properly served.
 
Petitioner also requests attorney’s fees and costs in the
amount of $3,810.  (Ibid. at ¶
10.) Petitioner
may request attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to a separate noticed motion
under Civil Code § 8488.

For the foregoing reasons,
 
The Petition for Release of Property from Mechanic’s Lien,
filed by Petitioner Seung Ri Jung, is DENIED.

notice.
