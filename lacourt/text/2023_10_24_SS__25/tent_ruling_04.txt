ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
On April 7, 2022, Plaintiff Western Surety Company
(“Plaintiff” or “Western Surety”) filed a Complaint for Interpleader against
Defendants Kevin Doyle Clark dba Diamond Construction (“Clark”), Hermana Joetta
Clay (“Clay”), Elicee Hennessee (“Hennessee”), Tammy Williams (“Tammy”), and
Kevin Williams (“Kevin”) (collectively “Defendants”).
 
On May 24, 2022, pursuant to Plaintiff’s request, the
Court dismissed Defendants Tammy and Kevin Williams without prejudice.  (5-18-22 Request for Dismissal.)
 
On May 20, 2022, Defendant Herma JoEtta Clay (erroneously
sued as Hermana JoEtta Clay), in propria persona, filed an Answer to the
Complaint.
 
On June 20, 2023, pursuant to Plaintiff’s request,
default was entered against Defendants Clark and Hennessee.  (6-20-23 Requests for Entry of Default.)
 
On June 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to
Deposit and Discharge Stakeholder and Request for Attorney’s Fees (“Motion”).  On August 30, 2023, the Court, on its own
motion, continued the hearing to September 14, 2023.  (8-30-23 Minute Order.)
 
No opposition has been filed to Plaintiff’s Motion.
 
II.                
Legal
Standard
 
Interpleader is a procedure whereby a person holding
money or personal property to which conflicting claims are being made by
others, can join the adverse claimants, and force them to litigate their claims
among themselves.  (See Code of
Civ. Proc. § 386; Hancock Oil Co. v.
Hopkins (1944) 24 Cal. 2d 497, 508; City
of Morgan Hill v. Brown (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1114, 1122-23.)
 
Once the stakeholder’s right to
interplead is established, and he or she deposits the money or personal
property in court, he or she may be discharged from liability to any of the
claimants.  This enables the stakeholder
to avoid a multiplicity of actions, and the risk of inconsistent results if
each of the claimants were to sue him or her separately.  (Cantu
v. Resolution Trust Corp. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 857, 874; City of Morgan Hill, supra, 71
Cal.App.4th at 1122.)
 
“An interpleader action is traditionally viewed as two
suits: one between the stakeholder and the claimants to determine the
stakeholder's right to interplead, and the other among the claimants to
determine who shall receive the funds interpleaded ... As against the
stakeholder, claimants may raise only matters which go to whether the suit is
properly one for interpleader; i.e., whether the elements of an interpleader
action are present.”  (State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Pietak
(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 600, 612.)
 
If the defendant-stakeholder claims no interest in the
funds or property held, he or she need not file an interpleader
cross-complaint.  He or she may simply
apply to the court for permission to deposit the money or property with the
court clerk, and for an order discharging him or her from further liability to
the adverse claimants.  Such order will
also substitute the adverse claimants as parties to the action; or, if only
money is involved, simply dismiss the stakeholder.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 386(a), 386.5.)  The motion must be supported by an affidavit
by the stakeholder establishing the ground for interpleader.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 386, subd. (a).) 
The supporting affidavit must also state that the moving party is “a
mere stakeholder with no interest in the amount or any portion thereof and that
conflicting demands have been made upon him for the amount by parties to the
action…”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
386.5.)  Notice of the motion must be
served on each of the adverse claimants to the funds or property.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 386, subd. (a),
386.5.)  “Where a deposit has been made
pursuant to Section 386, the court shall, upon the application of any party to
the action, order such deposit to be invested in an insured interest-bearing
account.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 386.1.)
 
Pursuant to § 386, subd. (f), the
court may also “enter may enter its order restraining all parties to the action
from instituting or further prosecuting any other proceeding in any court in
this state affecting the rights and obligations as between the parties to the
interpleader until further order of the court.” 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 386, subd. (f).)
 
The stakeholder may seek reimbursement for its costs and
reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 386.6; UAP-Columbus JV
326132 v. Nesbitt (1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1028, 1036.)  The court may order payment thereof out of the
funds deposited by the stakeholder. (Code Civ. Proc., § 386.6.)
 
III.             
Discussion

 
A.     Motion to Dismiss and Discharge
 
The subject matter of the instant Motion is a $15,000 Contractor’s
State License Bond issued to Defendant Kevin Doyle Clark, individually, and dba
Diamond Construction, as principal.  (Sosa
Decl. ¶ 2.)
 
Plaintiff filed a Complaint in Interpleader naming the
following claimants to the bond:
 
1.      Kevin Doyle Clark, individually, and
dba Diamond Construction (Defaulted);
2.      Hermana JoEtta Clay (Answered);
3.      Elicee Hennessee (Defaulted);
4.      Tammy Williams (Dismissed);
5.      Kevin Williams (Dismissed).
 
(Ibid.
at ¶¶ 3-4; Compl.)
 
Plaintiff contends that “it does not know and cannot
determine the respective merits of the remaining claimants which are
conflicting claims against the subject bond” and finds that the interpleader is
a “safe, expedient, or economical remedy.” 
(Sosa Decl. ¶ 8.)  Plaintiff
states that it “has no interest in the proceeds of Bond No. 64811079 and is a
mere stakeholder with respect thereto pursuant to CCP § 386.5.”  (Ibid.)  Plaintiff requests permission from the Court
to deposit the $15,000 bond with the Court, less attorney’s fees and costs, and
be discharged from further liability to claimants in regard to this bond.  (Mot. p. 2.) 
It also requests that the Court issue a restraining order against
claimants and all other persons from instituting further legal action against Western
Surety with respect to this bond, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 386,
subd. (f).  (Ibid. at pp. 2-3.)
 
Plaintiff has served the moving papers on Defendants Clark,
Clay, and Hennessee via mail.  (Mot. p. 18.)
 
In
addition, Plaintiff deposited the interpleader funds on September 21, 2023.
(Notice of Deposit.)
 
The Court
finds that Plaintiff has satisfied all requirements for the instant Motion.
Thus, Plaintiff is entitled to be dismissed and discharged from liability.  The Court will also issue a restraining
order. 
 
            Thus, the motion is GRANTED.
 
B.     Attorney’s Fees and Costs
 
The stakeholder may seek reimbursement for its costs and
reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred.  (Code
Civ. Proc. § 386.6; UAP-Columbus JV
326132 v. Nesbitt (1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1028, 1036.)  The court may order payment thereof out of
the funds deposited by the stakeholder. 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 386.6.)
 
            Plaintiff requests $2000 in attorney’s fees and costs related
to the interpleader.  (Sosa Decl. ¶ 6.)  The costs are as follows:
 
1.     
$370 filing fee,
2.     
$65 in service fees as to Defendant Clark,
individually, and dba Diamond Construction,
3.     
$70 in service fees as to Defendant Hermana JoEtta
Clay,
4.     
$70 in service fees as to Defendant Elicee
Hennessee,
5.     
$55 in service fees as to Defendant Tammy Williams;
6.     
$70 in service fees as to Defendant Kevin Williams;
7.     
$60 filing fee for instant Motion.
 
(Ibid.)  Furthermore, Plaintiff’s counsel has attached
an itemized statement containing details of the billing of attorney’s fees and
states that an additional $510 in attorney’s fees is requested for filing the
instant Motion.  (Ibid.; Ex. 1.)  The Court finds Plaintiff’s request to be reasonable.
 
IV.             
Conclusion
& Order
 
Plaintiff Western Surety Company’s Motion for Order to
Deposit by Stakeholder, Restraining Order, and Request for Attorney Fees is granted.
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
