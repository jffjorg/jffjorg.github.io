And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Kosim Midek and Mega Intan v. Allstate Northbrook Indemnity Company. The case involves a motion to vacate an order compelling arbitration of an uninsured motorist claim. The judge has found that the respondent, Allstate Northbrook Indemnity Company, has failed to establish that it was not properly served with the petition to compel arbitration. The judge has also found that the respondent has failed to establish that the venue for the petition is improper. As a result, the judge has ordered that the order compelling arbitration be vacated, and the petition be dismissed. The judge has also ordered that the respondent's counsel provide notice and file proof of such with the court. The judge has noted that this order is without prejudice to the petitioners seeking relief in a related case pending in the San Bernardino Superior Court.
