 Case Number:  23STCP03566    Hearing Date:   March 6, 2024    Dept:  39 Quality Loan
Service Corp. v. All Claimants to Surplus Funds
Case No.
23STCP03566
Motion to
Discharge Petitioner and Deposit Surplus Funds
 
Petitioner Quality Loan Service
Corporation (“Petitioner”) filed this action to address surplus funds from a
trustee’s sale. According to the petition, the deed of trust was executed by
Shanna Soomi Choi on May 13, 2009. The property that was subject to the
trustee’s sale was held on April 10, 2023. The property was sold for $385,000.
After payment of costs/expenses and satisfaction of the obligations secured by
the deed of trust, per Civil Code section 2924k(a)(1) & (2), there was a
surplus of $191,358.66. 
 
Petitioner received a claim from
the junior lien holder (Santa Rosalia 102, Inc.) and accordingly disbursed
funds in the amount of $7,187.50. Petitioner also seeks to deduct an additional
$5,517.35 in costs and expenses associated with this litigation.  Petitioner moves for an order depositing the
remainder of the surplus funds—$178,653.81—with the Court and discharging
Petitioner of any liability. The Court would then consider any claims to the
surplus funds. If no claims are filed within thirty (30) days of the Court’s
order, i.e., a claim from Shanna Soomi Choi, the funds would escheat to the
State of California as unclaimed property. 
 
The Court issued a tentative order
on January 24, 2024.  The Court provided
notice that it would grant the tentative order unless there is an opposition or
other good cause.  No opposition has been
filed.  Therefore, the Court adopts its
tentative order and orders as follows:
 
1.         Petitioner’s
motion is granted.  The Court approves
Petitioner’s request for reimbursement of $5,517.35 in costs.  The Court orders Petitioner to deposit the
remainder of the surplus funds—$178,653.81—with the Court.  The Court discharges Petitioner of any
liability associated with these funds.
 
2.         The
Court sets a deadline of April 10, 2024 (which is 30 days plus an additional
five days for notice) for any claims. Claims may be filed in the
above-referenced case. Anyone who wishes to file a claim but is experiencing
difficulty doing so may contact the Court’s clerk, Roberto Mendoza, at (213)
633-0159 for assistance. Anyone may file a claim by personally visiting the
courtroom—Department #39—during court hours, and the Court’s clerk will accept
the claim for filing. 
 
3.         The
Court will hold a hearing on April 19, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. at the following
location: 
 
Stanley Mosk Courthouse 
111 North Hill Street 
Department #39 (Goorvitch, J.) 
Los Angeles, California 90012 
 
All claims will be considered at that time.  Any claimant may appear and address the Court
at the hearing.
 
            4.         If no claims are filed, the Court will
order that the surplus shall escheat to the State of California as unclaimed
property. 
 
5.         Petitioner
shall provide notice to Shanna Soomi Choi at all potential addresses, as well
as any other potential claimant of which Petitioner is aware. 
 
6.         Petitioner
shall file a proof of service with the Court forthwith.
