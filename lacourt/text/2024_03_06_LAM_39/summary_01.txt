And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Shuo Wang, M.D. v. Victor Le, et al. Plaintiff Shuo Wang, M.D. filed an ex parte application to file a second amended complaint and to advance the hearing date. The Court has denied the application and set the first available hearing date as April 10, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.

The Court has also issued an Order to Show Cause why the five-year deadline should not be tolled. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 583.310, the action must be brought to trial within five years. However, the Court has determined that certain time periods during which bringing the action to trial was impossible, impracticable, or futile should be excluded. These time periods include the period from March 16, 2020, to January 4, 2021, when civil jury trials were suspended due to COVID-19, and the period from January 4, 2021, to May 11, 2021, when it was impossible for Department #39 to proceed with jury trials due to the size of the courtroom and other factors.

Based on these calculations, the new deadline for the case to proceed to trial would be May 11, 2026. The Court will hold a hearing on the Order to Show Cause on April 10, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., and any party may file a written objection on or before April 3, 2024.
