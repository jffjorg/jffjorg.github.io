And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the University of Southern California's demurrer to plaintiff Jeffrey Ito's complaint without leave to amend. The court finds that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action for invasion of privacy, negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The judge also denies as moot the defendant's motion to strike portions of the complaint. The court orders the defendant to prepare, serve, and lodge a proposed judgment of dismissal within 10 days of the order. The judge notes that the plaintiff has not met his burden to show how he can amend his complaint to render it sufficient against the defendant.
