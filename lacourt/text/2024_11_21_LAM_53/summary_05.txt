And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendant, Eden Atias Productions, Inc. The judge notes that the plaintiff's request has several defects, including inconsistent relief requested in the mandatory Judicial Council form CIV-100 and the failure to dismiss all Doe defendants. Additionally, the plaintiff failed to lodge a proposed judgment by default on Judicial Council form JUD-100. The judge orders the plaintiff to correct these deficiencies by filing a revised request for entry of default, dismissing the Doe defendants, and lodging a proposed judgment by default with the court by December 2, 2024. The hearing on the Order to Show Cause re entry of default judgment is continued to December 16, 2024.
