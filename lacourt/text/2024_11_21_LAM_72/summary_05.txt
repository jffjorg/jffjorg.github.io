Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge sustains the demurrer to the Cross-Complaint filed by Defendant Mordchai Brafman without leave to amend. The judge finds that the claims against Plaintiff Jeffrey Aaron Cohen in the Cross-Complaint are barred by the prior action of Brafman v. Benaroya, which was litigated to a final judgment on the merits. The judge also finds that the claims are barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel. The judge concludes that the Cross-Complaint does not state a cause of action and that any claims against Cohen are barred by the prior action.
