Background
 
            This
is an unlawful detainer case. 
 
            Defendant
is a tenant at the real property located at 1045 E 34th Street, Los Angeles, CA
90011 Los Angeles County (the “Property”). 
 
            On
or around January 1, 1993, Plaintiff and Defendant entered a residential lease agreement
regarding the Property (the “Lease”), whereby Defendant agreed to pay Plaintiff
$1,200.00 in monthly rent (later increased to $1,700.00).
 
            On
March 25, 2024, Plaintiff issued Defendant a three-day notice to pay rent or
quit.
 
            Plaintiff
filed this action on April 2, 2024, raising one claim for unlawful detainer.
Plaintiff sought possession of the premises and payment of unpaid rent.
 
            A
non-jury trial was held on July 30, 2024 and August 16, 2024.
            
            On
August 20, 2024, the Court entered judgment for Defendant and against
Plaintiff.
 
            Defendant
filed this motion for attorney’s fees on September 30, 2024. Plaintiff filed an
opposition and Defendant filed a reply.
 
Legal Standard
 
The moving party bears the burden of proof as to
“reasonableness” of any fee claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(5).)
The party seeking fees has the burden of documenting the appropriate hours
expended and hourly rates. (City of Colton v. Singletary (2012) 206
Cal.App.4th 751, 784.) This burden requires competent evidence as to the nature
and value of the services rendered. (Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182
Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) A plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima
facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were necessarily
incurred. (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) 
 
“In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many
hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point
to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to
the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative,
or unrelated do not suffice.” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 488, quoting Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. California
Ins. Guarantee Ass’n (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) When items are
properly objected to, the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as
costs. (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623-624.)
 
Discussion
 
Entitlement to Fees
 
“A landlord who institutes an unlawful detainer proceeding
based upon a tenant's nonpayment of rent, and who is liable for a violation of
Section 1942.4 of the Civil Code, shall be liable to the tenant or lessee for reasonable
attorneys’ fees and costs of the suit, in an amount to be fixed by the court.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1174.21.)
 
“A landlord of a dwelling may not demand rent, collect rent,
issue a notice of a rent increase, or issue a three-day notice to pay rent or
quit pursuant to subdivision (2) of Section 1161 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, if all of the following conditions exist prior to the landlord's
demand or notice:
 
(1) The dwelling
substantially lacks any of the affirmative standard characteristics listed in
Section 1941.1or violates Section 17920.10 of the Health and Safety Code, or is
deemed and declared substandard as set forth in Section 17920.3 of the Health and
Safety Code because conditions listed in that section exist to an extent that
endangers the life, limb, health, property, safety, or welfare of the public or
the occupants of the dwelling.
 
(2) A public
officer or employee who is responsible for the enforcement of any housing law,
after inspecting the premises, has notified the landlord or the landlord's
agent in writing of his or her obligations to abate the nuisance or repair the
substandard conditions.
 
(3) The conditions
have existed and have not been abated 35 days beyond the date of service of the
notice specified in paragraph (2) and the delay is without good cause. For
purposes of this subdivision, service shall be complete at the time of deposit
in the United States mail.
 
(4) The conditions
were not caused by an act or omission of the tenant or lessee in violation of
Section 1929 or 1941.2.”
 
(Civ. Code, § 1942.4.)
 
            At
trial the Court found that Defendant had factually established a violation of
Civil Code, section 1942.4. (Minute Order dated August 16, 2024 at pp. 1-2.)
The Court found that section 1942.4 barred the issuance of a three-day notice
in this case. (Minute Order dated August 16, 2024 at p. 1.)
 
Thus, Defendant is entitled to attorney’s fees under section
1174.21.
 
Hourly Rates and Hours
 
Defendant requests 16 hours for Thomas and 47.9 hours for
Hermansen.
 
In her motion, Defendant requests 16 hours for Rikisha
Thomas at an hourly rate of $425.00. In her reply brief, Defendant notes that
the motion contains a typo whereby the name of Angela Chavez is stated instead
of Thomas. (Compare Reply at p. 3:24-26 with Motion at p. 7:26-27.) However,
Defendant’s evidence of hourly rates and time spent on this case is for Thomas.
(See generally Declaration of Rikisha Thomas.) Although Thomas declares that
her hourly rate is $450.00 (Thomas Decl. ¶ 4), Defendant’s attorney fee request
in her notice of motion appears to be based on an hourly rate of $425.00. 
 
The Court finds that Thomas’s rate is reasonable based on
her experience. (See Thomas Decl. ¶¶ 3-4.)
 
However, the Court does not find that Defendant has met her
burden of showing that the time expended by Thomas was reasonable.  Defendant does not adequately explain why she
is requesting the hours of two different attorneys.  It appears that Hermansen took over the trial
for Thomas and is already charging for time conferring with Thomas and
familiarizing himself with the record. 
There is no indication of how Thomas’s work was used or was useful.
Moreover, and fundamentally, Thomas’s very general descriptions of work, such
as “review documents” and “prepare for jury trial” do not let the Court assess
whether the work was reasonable.  For
these reasons, the Court does not award the requested fees for Thomas. 
 
Defendant requests an hourly rate of $500.00 for Kevin
Hermansen. The Court finds that these rates are reasonable based on Hermansen’s
experience. (See Hermansen Decl. ¶¶ 3-9.)
 
Plaintiff objects to .1 hours for Hermansen on July 26, 2024
for “[a]dvise Thomas re form to Request court reporter”. (See Hermansen Decl. ¶
23, p. 17:10-11.) The Court finds that this de minimis time expenditure was
reasonable.
 
Plaintiff objects to .3 hours for Hermansen on July 26, 2024
for “[t]elecon with Plaintiff’s counsel Marinaccio re status of trial,
exhibits, witnesses (.1)” (See Hermansen Decl. ¶ 23, p. 17:13-14.) Plaintiff
points out that the work column states a lower time amount than the time
billed. The Court agrees and reduces Hermansen’s hours by .2.
 
The Court awards 47.7 hours for Hermansen. The Court thus
awards a total of $23,850.
