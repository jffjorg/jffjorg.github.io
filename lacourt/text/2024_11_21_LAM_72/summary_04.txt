And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $23,850.00, which is a portion of the $31,150.00 requested. The judge finds that the defendant is entitled to attorney's fees under Code of Civil Procedure, § 1174.21, as the plaintiff issued a three-day notice to pay rent or quit, which is barred by Civil Code, § 1942.4. The judge awards fees to the defendant's counsel, Rikisha Thomas, for 47.7 hours at an hourly rate of $500.00, and to Kevin Hermansen for 47.7 hours at an hourly rate of $500.00. The judge finds that Thomas's hourly rate is reasonable, but does not award fees for Thomas due to lack of evidence of reasonable time expended. The judge awards fees for Hermansen's work, but reduces the hours billed by .2 hours. The plaintiff is ordered to pay the awarded attorney's fees within 30 days of the issuance of this order.
