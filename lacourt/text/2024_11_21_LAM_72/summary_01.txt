Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings by CalPERS, defendant in the case. The case involves a dispute over the proper classification of Individual Plaintiffs under a retirement formula. The judge has found that the administrative law judge (ALJ) in the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) proceedings has made a final judgment on the merits, and accordingly, issue preclusion applies. The judge has concluded that the Individual Plaintiffs were properly classified under the 3% by 55 formula, and therefore, the declaratory relief claim is resolved in CalPERS's favor.
