Here is a brief English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted several motions filed by the plaintiffs, including motions to compel further responses to discovery requests and special interrogatories. The court has ordered the defendants to produce additional documents and respond to the special interrogatories. The court has also denied the plaintiffs' request for sanctions. The court has ordered the defendants to serve supplemental responses within 30 days of the order. The dispute centers around whether the defendants made all payments owed to the plaintiffs, and whether the plaintiffs are entitled to 10% of the profits from the sale of the company.
