And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment is denied. The defendant, Moses Galimba, claims that he was not served with the summons and complaint and that his son, Bryan Galimba, fraudulently purchased the vehicle in his name without his knowledge. The defendant argues that he was not aware of the lawsuit until late 2023 and that he did not have a meritorious defense. The plaintiff, Bank of the West, argues that the defendant had actual notice of the lawsuit and that the defendant's claims are without merit.

The court finds that the defendant has not presented a satisfactory excuse for not presenting his defense in the first place and that the defendant does not qualify for equitable relief from default. The court also finds that the defendant's request to quash service of the summons and complaint is procedurally improper.

The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 473, which allows a court to set aside a default judgment in certain circumstances, and California Commercial Code sections 9601 and 9609, which govern the enforcement of retail installment sale contracts.
