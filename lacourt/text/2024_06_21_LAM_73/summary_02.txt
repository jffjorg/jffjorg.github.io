And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Caesarstone LTD's motion to strike portions of the First Amended Complaint. The motion was made on the grounds that the allegations of punitive damages were insufficient and that the allegations relating to other silica-containing stone products to be determined during discovery were too vague. The judge found that the allegations of punitive damages were sufficient, citing specific facts about what Caesarstone LTD knew about the hazards of its product and how it concealed them. The judge also found that the allegations relating to other silica-containing stone products were not too vague, citing the Bockrath decision. The judge concluded that the First Amended Complaint had pled sufficient allegations to support punitive damages and denied the motion to strike.
