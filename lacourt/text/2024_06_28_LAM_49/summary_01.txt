**Significant Statements**

* "The analysis is largely incompatible with a demurrer, considering a party may raise equitable estoppel or various other defenses designated in the statute, which will often present factual questions."
* "The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action."
* "The FAC therefore 'relates back' to the filing of the Complaint, and the new claims are timely."
* "Plaintiff seeks punitive damages in an amount no less than $1,000,000, or at least three times Plaintiff's damages, whichever is greater."
