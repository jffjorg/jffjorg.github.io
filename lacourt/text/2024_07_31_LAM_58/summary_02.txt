Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for leave to amend the First Amended Complaint in part, and has substituted Kerri Stern as the successor in interest. However, the motion to amend the First Amended Complaint to add a cause of action for wrongful death is denied without prejudice. The judge found that Stern has complied with the procedural requirements for substituting a successor in interest, but has not complied with the procedures for amending the First Amended Complaint. The judge also notes that combining motions is improper and that filing fees are jurisdictional.
