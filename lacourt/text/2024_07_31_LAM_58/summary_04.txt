And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to vacate a judgment entered by the Labor Commissioner in favor of plaintiff Rachelle Escalera against defendant Sean Saberi. The motion was filed by the Labor Commissioner, who is seeking to vacate the judgment due to a mistaken determination. The Judge has denied the motion, citing the Labor Code and the Code of Civil Procedure. The Judge notes that the Commissioner does not have the authority to modify or challenge the judgment after the fact, and that the judgment is not voidable by the Commissioner or any other party. The Judge also notes that the defendant's bankruptcy does not affect the enforceability of the judgment, which is only voidable by the bankrupt debtor. The motion to vacate the judgment is denied.
