**Tentative Ruling**
```
* Barham Defendants' Demurrer on the ground of lack of serious invasion of privacy is overruled.
* The sixth cause of action is uncertain and the Demurrer is sustained with leave to amend.
* Fidler Defendants' request for joinder is granted.
```
**Background**
```
* Plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendants on March 7, 2024.
* The complaint alleges six causes of action, including defamation, false light, and invasion of privacy.
* The Court granted separate Special Motions to Strike of Fidler Defendants and Barham, striking the first through fifth causes of action.
```
**Legal Standard**
```
* A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, and the grounds for which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
* The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading by raising questions of law.
```
**Discussion**
```
* Barham Defendants argue that the alleged invasion of privacy was not serious, but the Court finds that the allegations of the complaint establish a serious invasion of privacy.
* The Court rejects Barham Defendants' reliance on Mezger v. Bick and Hernandez v. Hillsides, Inc., as those cases involved motions for summary judgment where the defendants presented undisputed evidence as to the precise nature and circumstances of the alleged invasions.
* The Court finds that the length of time the cameras allegedly pointed into Plaintiff's apartment (approximately three to four days) is not de minimis and that the circumstances of the camera installation were not offensive as a matter of law.
```
**Facts**
```
* Plaintiff alleges that the defendants installed security cameras at the rental premises without proper consent and in a manner that intrudes upon Plaintiff's reasonable expectation of privacy within their home.
