And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Defendant TriNet Group, Inc.'s Motion to Compel Arbitration and has ordered the action to be stayed pending completion of arbitration. The arbitration agreement exists between TriNet Group, Inc. and Larry Schwartz and applies to claims arising out of or relating to co-employment with TriNet and/or employment with OTTera, Inc. The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies to the agreement.

The court found that the agreement is not substantively unconscionable. The scope of the agreement is reasonable and limited to claims arising out of the employment relationship, and the duration of the agreement is reasonable and not terminable at will. The agreement also does not lack mutuality, and the PAGA waiver is unenforceable but can be severed from the rest of the agreement.

The court therefore granted Defendant TriNet Group, Inc.'s Motion to Compel Arbitration and ordered the action to be stayed pending completion of arbitration.
