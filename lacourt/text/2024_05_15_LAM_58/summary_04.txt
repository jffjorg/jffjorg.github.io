And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the first and fourth causes of action of the First Amended Complaint. The action is stayed pending the disposition of the unlawful detainer action. The ruling is based on the court's determination that the primary right asserted in both the current action and the second UD action is the same, namely the right to possession of the subject property. The court finds that the two actions are the same because they both seek to terminate Defendant's possession of the property and restore possession to Plaintiff. Therefore, the demurrer is sustained under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (c).
