Tentative
Ruling:      The Motion for Leave to File a First Amended Complaint and First
Amended Answer to the Cross-Complaint is denied. 

 
This is an action
for declaratory relief. On April 4, 2023, Plaintiff Christopher Chong (Plaintiff
or Chong) filed the instant action for declaratory relief, seeking – in
relevant part – a judicial declaration that Mardirossian Akaragian LLP’s (Defendant
Mardirossian) “claim to 45% of the settlement proceeds, which together with
costs totals $2,761,458.62,” is neither a fair nor reasonable value of the
legal services provided in this matter.
 
On May 30, 2023, Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Mardirossian filed a Cross-Complaint for declaratory relief, seeking a judicial
declaration of the amount of attorney’s fees and costs owed by Plaintiff Chong
to Mardirossian.
 
On January 9, 2024,
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Mardirossian moved for
summary judgment, or, in the alternative, summary adjudication of the declaratory
relief cause of action in the Complaint and in its Cross-Complaint. Plaintiff
Chong filed an opposition. The Court granted the motion for summary judgment on
March 26, 2024.
 
While the motion
for summary judgment was pending, Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a First
Amended Complaint and First Amended Answer to the Cross-Complaint. Defendant Mardirossian
opposed the motion. The opposition was joined by Defendant Gerald Kroll. 
 
            The
motion for leave to amend is denied. 
 
Legal Standard
 
            Leave
to amend the pleadings may be granted at any stage of the action. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subdivision (a);
see also Code Civ. Proc., §
576.)  The Court’s discretion will
usually be exercised liberally to permit amendment of the pleadings. (Mabie v. Hyatt (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th
581, 596.)
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
Chong moves for leave to file a First Amended Complaint and a First Amended
Answer to Defendant/Cross-Complainant’s Cross-Complaint. 
 
The motion for
leave to amend seeks to add allegations to the existing judicial declaration
cause of action in the Complaint and add defenses in the Answer to the
Cross-Complaint. Specifically, the added allegations allege that Defendant is
further barred from obtaining fees sought based on “fraudulent statements made
to Chong” (Mot., Ex. 1 [Proposed FAC ¶¶ 19-21, 24-25]), contract enforceability
(Mot., Ex. 3 [Proposed Amended Answer ¶ 9]) and based on Defendant’s
“abandonment” of Plaintiff’s case (Proposed FAC ¶¶ 22-23).
 
By way of
background of this motion, on April 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant
complaint for declaratory relief. On May 30, 2023, Defendant Mardirossian filed
a Cross-Complaint. On January 9, 2024, Defendant Mardirossian filed a motion
for summary judgment and summary adjudication on the declaratory relief claims
in the Complaint and Cross-Complaint. The motion for summary judgment had a
hearing date of March 26, 2024. On March 5, 2024, the Court considered
Plaintiff’s ex parte application seeking to continue the motion for summary
judgment; the Court denied the motion. Thereafter, on March 12, 2024, Plaintiff
filed an opposition to the motion for summary judgment. 
 
On March 21, 2024
– five days before the hearing on the motion for summary judgment – Plaintiff
filed this motion for leave to amend. Plaintiff never appeared ex parte to
advance the hearing of this motion. On March 26, 2024, the Court granted Defendant
Mardirossian’s motion for summary judgment. 
 
Importantly to
this motion for leave to file amended pleadings, in ruling on this motion for
summary judgment, the Court considered Plaintiff’s opposition argument and evidence
relating to these allegations of fraud, abandonment, and contract
enforceability. (Opp. To MSJ, 17:25-20:17 [PSS 52, 54 [Fraud]; PSS 54, 59, 61
[Client abandonment]; PSS 63-65 [contract enforceability evidence]].) That is,
all of the allegations sought to be added to the pleadings by way of this
motion were raised in Plaintiff’s opposition to the motion to for summary
judgment. The Court considered Plaintiff Chong’s legal arguments and underlying
evidence. The Court granted summary judgment against Plaintiff.
 
            Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (a)(1), a court has ample
discretion to deny a motion for leave to amend where a proposed amendment is
legally futile or where there has been inexcusable delay in making the motion.
(Jo Redland Trust, U.A.D. 4-6-05 v. CIT Bank, N.A. (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th
142, 161–162.) “ ‘Leave to amend should be denied only where the facts are not
in dispute, and the nature of the plaintiff's claim is clear, but under
substantive law, no liability exists and no amendment would change the result.’
” (Howard v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428; Huff
v. Wilkins (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 732, 746 [“Leave to amend is properly
denied when the facts are undisputed and as a substantive matter no liability
exists under the plaintiff's new theory.”].)
 
Based on the
foregoing, allowing amendment of the Complaint and Answer to the
Cross-Complaint at this stage of litigation would be futile; the summary
judgment ruling would have been the same.
 
Conclusion
 
The motion for leave
to file a First Amended Complaint and First Amended Answer to the
Cross-Complaint is denied.
