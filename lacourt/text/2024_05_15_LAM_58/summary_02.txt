And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint and First Amended Answer to the Cross-Complaint. The motion was filed by Plaintiff Christopher Y. Chong, who seeks to add allegations to the existing judicial declaration cause of action in the Complaint and add defenses in the Answer to the Cross-Complaint. The added allegations allege that Defendant is further barred from obtaining fees sought based on "fraudulent statements made to Chong", contract enforceability, and based on Defendant's "abandonment" of Plaintiff's case. The Court granted summary judgment against Plaintiff Chong. The Court finds that allowing amendment of the Complaint and Answer at this stage of litigation would be futile, as the summary judgment ruling would have been the same.
