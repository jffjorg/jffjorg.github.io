Tentative
Ruling:      The Demurrer
to the first and fourth causes of action of the First Amended Complaint is sustained.
The action is stayed pending the disposition of the unlawful detainer action.
 

 
 
This action arises from a
commercial landlord-tenant dispute. On March 15, 2023,
Plaintiff 819 S. Flower, LP (Plaintiff) and Defendants
LuxUrban RE Holdings, LLC and
LuxUrban Hotels Inc. (Defendants) entered into a commercial
lease to operate a hotel (Original
Lease). The First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleges that
Defendants made a number of fraudulent representations to induce Plaintiff to
enter into this Original Lease. As a result of these representations and
failures to comply with the terms of the Original Lease, the parties negotiated
a new lease agreement (Restatement); Defendants signed the Restatement, but
Plaintiff never signed it. Thereafter, the FAC alleges, Defendants repeatedly breached
the terms of the Restatement.
 
On October 13, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a Complaint for (1.) rescission, (2.) breach of the Restatement, (3.)
declaratory relief, (4.) ejectment, and (5.) breach of guaranty.
 
On December 15, 2023, Defendants
filed a demurrer to the Complaint. The Court sustained the demurrer with leave
to amend the first and fourth causes of action, sustained without leave to
amend the second cause of action as to LuxUrban Inc. only, and overruled as to
the third cause of action. 
 
On March 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
FAC for (1.) rescission, (2.) breach of the contract, (3.) declaratory relief,
(4.) ejectment, and (5.) breach of guaranty.
 
On April 8, 2024, Defendants demurred
to the first and fourth causes of action to the FAC. Plaintiff filed an
opposition to the demurrer. Defendants filed a reply. 
 
Defendants’ request for judicial
notice of Exhibits 1-2 is granted. (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d), (h).)  
 
 
 
 
Legal Standard for Demurrers 
 
A demurrer is an objection to a
pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the face of the
complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d
311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a
pleading by raising questions of law. (Postley v. Harvey (1984) 153
Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a pleading, for the purpose of
determining its effect, its allegations must be liberally construed, with a
view to substantial justice between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The
court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly
pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law . . . .”
’ ” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying
these standards, the court liberally construes the complaint to determine
whether a cause of action has been stated. (Picton v. Anderson Union High
School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 726, 733.) 
 
When a demurrer is sustained, the
Court determines whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can
be cured by amendment.  (Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) 
When a plaintiff “has pleaded the general set of facts upon which his
cause of action is based,” the court should give the plaintiff an opportunity
to amend his complaint, since plaintiff should not “be deprived of his right to
maintain his action on the ground that his pleadings were defective for lack of
particulars.”  (Reed v. Norman
(1957) 152 Cal.App.2d 892, 900.) 
Generally, the court will allow leave to amend on at least the first
try, unless there is absolutely no possibility of overcoming the issue.  (See Angie M. v. Superior Court (1995)
37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227 ("Denial of leave to amend constitutes an abuse
of discretion unless the complaint shows on its face it is incapable of
amendment.  [Citation.]  Liberality in permitting amendment is the
rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.").)
 
Analysis
 
Defendants demur to the first and
fourth causes of action under Code of Civil Procedure § 430.10 (c) & (e) on
the grounds that they fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action and becauses there is another action pending between the same parties on
the same cause of action. 
 
Another Action Pending
 
“A plea in abatement pursuant to
section 430.10, subdivision (c), may be made by demurrer or answer when there
is another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action.”
(Plant Insulation Co. v. Fibreboard Corp. (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 781,
787) “In determining whether the causes of action are the same … the rule is
that such a plea may be maintained only where a judgment in the first action
would be a complete bar to the second action.” (Lord v. Garland (1946)
27 Cal.2d 840, 848.) 
 
Defendants argue that Plaintiff has
a pending unlawful detainer action against Luxurban Re Holdings, LLC. (Demur.
p. 8-9.) They contend that the actions are same because they both seek forfeiture
of possession under the Restatement and return of the subject property to Plaintiff.
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that the plea in abatement defense does not
apply because the two cases have not pleaded identical causes of action. (Opp’n
p. 10.) Plaintiff further asserts that res judicata does not apply between an
action for unlawful detainer and an action for ejectment because an unlawful
detainer action is a summary proceeding, relying on Malkoskie v. Option One
Mortgage Corp. (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 968, 973 (Malkoskie) and Vella
v. Hudgins  (1977) 20 Cal.3d 251,
257-258.)
 
The Court disagrees. A plea in
abatement defense does not ask the court whether the name of the pleaded causes
of action is the same, but rather whether the primary right asserted is the
same in both actions. (Bush v. Superior Court. (1992) 10 CA4th 1374,
1384.)
 
i.              
Same Parties
 
Here, the instant action and the
second UD action involve the same parties because Plaintiff and Defendant
Luxurban Re Holdings have the same relationship as Plaintiff and Defendant in
this action as they do in the second UD action, respectively. (See. Def. Request
for Judicial Notice; Exh. B.) Thus, both actions have the same parties. (Bush,
supra, 10 Cal.App.4th at p. 1384.)
 
ii.             
Same Cause of Action
 
Both actions assert the same cause
of action because the primary right asserted in both is for possession of the
subject property. The identity of the “causes of action” is determined by a
comparison of the facts alleged in each complaint. To be the same “cause of
action,” each complaint must allege invasion of the same “primary right.” (Bush
v. Sup.Ct. (Rains) (1992) 10 CA4th 1374, 1384.) As our Supreme Court has
explained: 
 
The primary right theory is a
theory of code pleading that has long been followed in California. It provides
that a “cause of action” is comprised of a “primary right” of the plaintiff, a
corresponding “primary duty” of the defendant, and a wrongful act by the
defendant constituting a breach of that duty. [Citation] The most salient
characteristic of a primary right is that it is indivisible: the violation of a
single primary right gives rise to but a single cause of action. [Citation] A
pleading that states the violation of one primary right in two causes of action
contravenes the rule against “splitting” a cause of action. [Citation] . .
.  
 
[T]he primary right is simply the
plaintiff’s right to be free from the particular injury suffered. [Citation] It
must therefore be distinguished from the legal theory on which liability for
that injury is premised: “Even where there are multiple legal theories upon
which recovery might be predicated, one injury gives rise to only one claim for
relief.” . . . The primary right theory . . . is invoked most often when a
plaintiff attempts to divide a primary right and enforce it in two suits. 
 
(Crowley v. Katleman (1994) 8 Cal.4th 666, 681-82.)
If a single primary right is invaded, only one cause of action arises, even if
the defendant allegedly breached that right in multiple ways, or under
different legal theories. (Bay Cities Paving & Grading, Inc. v. Lawyers'
Mut. Ins. Co. (1993) 5 Cal.4th 854, 860-61.)
 
Here, the first cause of action
seeks restoration of the premises by way of rescission of the lease agreements.
The fourth cause of action states that “Plaintiff . . . seeks a judgment of
ejectment against Defendants, as well as a prejudgment writ of possession,
entitling Plaintiff to sole possession of the Premises to the exclusion of
Defendants, or either of them.” (FAC ¶ 51.) Here, both the unlawful detainer
action and the claims for rescission and ejectment seek to terminate
Defendant’s possession of the subject property and restore possession to
Plaintiff. Thus, since the current action and the second UD action assert the
same primary right, Defendant’s demurrer is sustained under Code of Civil
Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (c). 
 
Conclusion 
 
The demurrer is sustained.  The action is stayed pending final judgment
in the unlawful detainer action.
