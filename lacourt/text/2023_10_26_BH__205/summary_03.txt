And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The plaintiff had filed an oversized 21-page memorandum, exceeding the 15-page limit, and did not seek ex parte relief from the Court. The judge has discretion to disregard oversize briefs and late-filed papers, and therefore denies the motion. The ruling is based on California Rules of Court 3.1113(d) and (g) and 3.1300(d).
