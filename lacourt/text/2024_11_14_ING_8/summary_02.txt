And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Georgiana Rosenkranz v. Cox Communications California, LLC, et al. The case involves a dispute over a sewer line that was allegedly ruptured, broken, and/or pierced by contractors who performed work under the plaintiff's home and nearby street. The plaintiff claims that the damage caused her property to suffer, and she seeks damages for nuisance and negligence.

The defendant, Cox Communications California, LLC, demurred to the complaint on the grounds that it is uncertain and ambiguous. The judge agrees with the defendant and sustains the demurrer, giving the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint. The judge finds that the complaint fails to allege the date of the alleged breach of duty, and it is impossible for the defendants to determine when, or even if, they worked on or near the sewer pipe when it was damaged.

The judge notes that the plaintiff's reliance on precedent holding that a demurrer for uncertainty will not lie where the ambiguous facts alleged are presumptively within the knowledge of the demurring party is misplaced. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to allege any dates whatsoever makes it impossible for the defendants to determine when, or even if, they worked on or near the sewer pipe when it was damaged.

The judge concludes that the demurrer is sustained, and the plaintiff is granted 20 days to amend the complaint. The judge orders Cox Communications California, LLC to give notice of the ruling.
