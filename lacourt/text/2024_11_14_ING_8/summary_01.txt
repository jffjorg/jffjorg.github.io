Summary:

The judge grants Tesla's Motion to Compel Arbitration, holding that the arbitration agreement is enforceable and that the dispute should be resolved through arbitration rather than the court system. The judge finds that the arbitration agreement is not unconscionable, despite Plaintiffs' arguments that it is. The judge also notes that the arbitration agreement provides for neutral arbitrators, minimal discovery, and written awards, which are consistent with California law. The judge sets an arbitration status date approximately 9 months out and stays the civil action pending arbitration.
