Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Yassine Zerouali's motion to compel further responses to discovery requests from Defendant Saleem Mahida. The Court finds that while Plaintiff did not make adequate attempts to meet and confer prior to filing the motion, this failure is not fatal to the motion. The Court also notes that Defendant did not provide full and complete responses to discovery requests, which may have caused some of the disputes.

The Court grants the motion in part, compelling Defendant to provide further responses to certain discovery requests. Specifically, the Court orders Defendant to provide contact information for witnesses to the incident and information about photographs, films, and videotapes of or concerning the incident. The Court also denies the motion in part, finding that Plaintiff's primary contention that Defendant has not produced documents that it produced in the parties' UD action is unclear.

The Court finds no sanctions are appropriate, as both parties took their positions in good faith. The Court orders Plaintiff to give notice and reminds the parties that they must submit on the tentative or arrange to appear remotely at the hearing.
