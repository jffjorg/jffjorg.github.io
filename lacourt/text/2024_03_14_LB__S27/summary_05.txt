And here is the English summary:

This tentative ruling denies the motion by Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC to compel Elsy Henriquez to arbitrate her dispute with the company. The motion was based on an arbitration agreement between Henriquez and the dealership where she purchased the subject automobile, which the company claimed could be enforced under a third-party beneficiary and/or estoppel theory. However, the Court of Appeals had previously ruled in Ochoa v. Ford Motor Company (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324 that a manufacturer cannot enforce a dealership's arbitration agreement under these theories. The court notes that the defendant did not mention the Ochoa holding in its motion, and opposes it. As a result, the motion to compel arbitration is denied. The parties are also reminded that there is a case management conference scheduled concurrently with the hearing on the motion.
