Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has rendered a tentative ruling on the summary judgment motions filed by the defendants. The judge has granted Dr. Jonnala's motion for summary judgment, as the plaintiffs have filed a notice of non-opposition. The judge has denied the remaining defendants' motions for summary judgment, as the plaintiffs' expert opinion raises a triable issue of material fact. The judge has also sustained the plaintiffs' evidentiary objections to the defendants' expert opinions, excluding the entirety of the defendants' expert opinion. As a result, the defendants have failed to meet their burden to show they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
