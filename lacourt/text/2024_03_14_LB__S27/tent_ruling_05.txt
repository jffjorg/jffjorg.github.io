 Case Number:  23LBCV01384    Hearing Date:   March 14, 2024    Dept:  S27 Plaintiff, Elsy Henriquez filed this action against Defendants, Mercedes-Benz
USA, LLC and Caliber Motors, Inc. for Violation of the Song-Beverly Act and
negligent repair.  
 
Defendant, Mercedez-Benz USA, LLC seeks to compel Plaintiff to arbitrate
her dispute with it.  It concedes it does
not have an arbitration agreement with Plaintiff, but seeks to compel arbitration
under Plaintiff’s agreement with the dealership from whom Plaintiff purchased
the subject automobile.  Defendant seeks
to compel arbitration under a third party beneficiary theory and also under an
estoppel theory.
 
On 4/04/23, the Court of Appeals decided Ochoa v. Ford Motor Company
(2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324. 
In Ochoa, the Court of Appeals expressly considered whether a
manufacturer of an automobile can enforce a dealership’s arbitration agreement
under a third party beneficiary and/or estoppel theory.  The Court of Appeals held that it
cannot.  Notably, Defendant filed this
motion on 12/11/23, and the motion is entirely silent concerning the Ochoa holding.  
 
Plaintiff, in opposition, correctly notes that Ochoa is on point and
undistinguishable from the instant motion. 
It considered the exact issues presented here, and found that the
manufacturer cannot enforce the seller’s arbitration agreement under an
equitable estoppel and/or third party beneficiary theory.  In light of Ochoa, the motion to compel arbitration
is denied.  
 
The parties are reminded that there
is a CMC on calendar concurrently with the hearing on the motion to compel arbitration.  The Court asks the parties to make arrangements
to appear remotely at the conference.
