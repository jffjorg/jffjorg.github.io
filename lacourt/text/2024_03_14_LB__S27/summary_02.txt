Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for summary judgment filed by defendant LBMMC, which argues that its nursing staff complied with the standard of care and that its actions did not cause or contribute to the plaintiff's claimed damages. The judge notes that the standard of care is a matter within the knowledge of experts, and that expert evidence is conclusive and cannot be disregarded. The judge also finds that the expert declarations submitted by LBMMC are sufficient to meet its moving burden to establish entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on the plaintiff's claims against it.

The judge further finds that the plaintiff's medical records establish that the plaintiff's treating physicians were neither actual nor ostensible agents at the time of treatment, and that the burden therefore shifts to the plaintiff to raise a triable issue of material fact in this regard.

Since the plaintiff failed to file any opposition to the motion by the deadline, the judge grants the motion for summary judgment. The judge orders the moving defendant to give notice and instructs the parties who intend to submit on the tentative to send an email to the court indicating their intention to do so.
