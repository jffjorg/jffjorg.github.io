And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to certify a class action lawsuit against Safe-Guard, a company that administers vehicle service contracts. The proposed class includes all California residents who have been charged a single deductible per visit or claim for the replacement of tires or wheels, regardless of the number of tires or wheels replaced. The judge is also considering a subclass of class members who were charged multiple deductibles on a per tire/wheel basis in connection with a single visit or claim, or who were charged deductibles in excess of the amount provided for by their vehicle service contract. The plaintiff claims that thousands of individuals may be part of this subclass, but the evidence only shows nine potential members. The judge notes that the plaintiff is not entitled to represent a bigger subclass than they establish, and will not assume or infer a bigger-than-established subclass.
