CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV21888 DANIEL ORTIZ vs
RENO KESHISHIAN, AN INDIVIDUAL, et al. 
Moving Party: Plaintiff 
Responding Party: Defendant SS Cal-Pacific 
Notice: Sufficient¿¿ 
Ruling: MOTIONS TO COMPEL INITIAL RESPONSES
AND REQUESTS FOR SANCTIONS ARE GRANTED
 
On October 12, 2023, Plaintiff served
Defendant SS CAL-Pacific with his Request for Production, Set One and Special
Interrogatories, Set One. Despite numerous attempts by Plaintiff to meet and
confer, no responses have been provided. Plaintiff now moves the Court to
compel Defendants to provide initial responses.
 
Defendants did not file an opposition or any
other filing indicating that responses were provided prior to the present
motion. Thus, the motions are granted. Defendant SS CAL-Pacific is ordered to
provide complete and verified responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories,
Set One, and Request for Production, Set One, without objections, within 20
days of today.
 
Plaintiff requests sanctions in the amount of
$829.15 per motion. Sanctions are mandatory and the Court finds Defendants have
not acted with substantial justification. However, due to the simplicity of the
issues, the Court reduces the amount of sanctions to $1000 against Defendant SS
CAL-PACIFIC, INC. and its attorney, jointly and severally, payable to Plaintiff
within 20 days of today.
