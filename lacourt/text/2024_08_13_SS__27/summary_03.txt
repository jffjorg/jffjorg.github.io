Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ruben Melikoff vs. Safeway Inc. et al. (Case No. 22STCV29373). The case involves motions to compel employee and PMK (Person Most Knowledgeable) depositions and requests for sanctions.

The judge finds that the defendant's objections to the deposition notices are invalid because the defendant failed to provide mutually agreeable dates for the depositions despite promises to do so. The judge also finds that the defendant failed to fulfill its commitment to meet and confer with the plaintiff.

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the employee and PMK depositions and orders that they be conducted within 14 days from the date of the ruling. The judge also imposes sanctions on the defendant and its counsel in the amount of $1,669.95, payable to the plaintiff within 30 days.

The judge notes that the plaintiff made efforts to meet and confer with the defendant, but the defendant failed to provide deposition dates despite promises to do so. The judge finds that the defendant's failure to provide deposition dates is a failure to proceed with the depositions as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450.

The judge encourages the parties to work together to resolve any issues concerning documents without court intervention. The judge also notes that the plaintiff reached out to the defendant on multiple occasions to obtain the deponents' availability, but none was provided, and therefore finds sanctions appropriate under the circumstances.
