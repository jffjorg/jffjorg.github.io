The judge has ordered the plaintiff to provide complete and verified discovery responses without objections to the defendant's special interrogatories and request for production of documents, set three. The judge has also ordered sanctions in the amount of $2,000 to be paid by the plaintiff and her attorney to the defendant within 30 days. The judge found that the plaintiff did not act with substantial justification and that sanctions are mandatory.
