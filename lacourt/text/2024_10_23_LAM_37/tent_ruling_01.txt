Background
 
On March 7, 2024, Maria Soto, on behalf of herself and other
aggrieved employees (“Plaintiff”) filed a PAGA action against the Jonathan Club
(“Defendant”). 
 
Defendant has now moved
to stay the action under the rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction.
Plaintiff opposes the Motion. The matter is now before the court. 
 
MOtion to
stay
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
When nearly identical actions are in courts of different
jurisdictions, the court in the second action may, in its discretion and as a
matter of comity, stay that action pending decision in the first action.¿ (Thomson
v. Continental Ins. Co. (1967) 66 Cal.2d 738, 746 (Thomson); Mave
Enterprises, Inc. v. Travelers Indemnity Co. (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1408,
1423; Gregg v. Superior Court (1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 134, 136; Simmons
v. Superior Court (1950) 96 Cal.App.2d 119, 123-124.)¿ In doing so, the
court should consider “ ‘the importance of discouraging multiple litigation
designed solely to harass an adverse party, and of avoiding unseemly conflicts
with the courts of other jurisdictions.¿ It should also consider whether the
rights of the parties can best be determined by the court of the other
jurisdiction because of the nature of the subject matter, the availability of
witnesses, or the stage to which the proceedings in the other court have
already advanced.’¿[Citation.]”¿ (Thomson, at pp. 746-747.)¿ 
“Under the rule of exclusive
concurrent jurisdiction, when two California superior courts have concurrent
jurisdiction over the subject matter and all parties involved in litigation,
the first to assume jurisdiction has exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over
the subject matter and all parties involved until such time as all necessarily
related matters have been resolved.¿ The rule is based upon the public policies
of avoiding conflicts that might arise between courts if they were free to make
contradictory decisions or awards relating to the same controversy, and
preventing vexatious litigation and multiplicity of suits.”¿ (People ex rel.
Garamendi v. American Autoplan, Inc. (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 760, 769-770.)¿ 
II.        Request for Judicial Notice
 
The court may take judicial notice
of records of any court of record of the United States. (Evid. Code, §
452(d)(2).) However, the court may only judicially notice the existence of the
record, not that its contents are the truth. (Sosinsky v. Grant (1992) 6
Cal.App.4th 1548, 1565.) 
 
Defendant requests judicial
notice of the following: 
 
1)    
Exhibit B: A true and correct copy
of  the Complaint in Joaquin Del Cid
Jr v. Jonathan Club, Case No. 20STCV12113. 
 
2)    
Exhibit C: A true and correct copy
of the Complaint in Maria Soto v. Jonathan Club, Case No. 24STCV05785. 
 
Defendant’s request for judicial
notice is granted. 
 
Plaintiff requests judicial
notice of the following: 
 
1)    
Exhibit A: Complaint filed on March 26,
2020 by Joaquin Del Cid, Jr. against Jonathan Club, filed in Los Angeles County
Superior Court, entitled Del Cid v. Jonathan Club; Case No. 20STCV12113
(the “Del Cid Matter”). 
 
2)    
Exhibit B: Exhibit B: Notice of Related
Cases filed on April 4, 2024, by Jonathan Club, in the Del Cid Matter.
 
3)    
Exhibit C: Exhibit C: Notice of Ruling
filed on April 26, 2024, by Jonathan Club, in the Del Cid Matter, wherein the
Honorable Stephen I. Goorvitch ruled that “cases, 20STCV12113 and 24STCV05785,
are not related under California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a).”
 
Plaintiff’s request for judicial
notice is granted. 
 
III.      Discussion
Defendant asserts that this
action should be stayed under the rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction
because there is an ongoing and earlier-filed PAGA action against Defendant
entitled Joaquin Del Cid Jr. v. Jonathan Club (the “Del Cid Action”)
(LASC Case No. 20STCV121130). 
 
A.        Defendant’s Motion is Timely and Not
Waived 
 
Plaintiff asserts that
Defendant waived the right to seek a stay based on the  rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction
because the issue was not raised on a demurrer. The court disagrees as the rule
of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction is an affirmative defense that can be
raised by demurrer or in the answer. (See Accurso v. In-N-Out Burgers
(2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 1128, 1154–1155; Color–Vue, Inc. v. Abrams (1996)
44 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1604.)
 
“By contrast, other sorts of
objections a defendant might have on the merits—including an objection that
liability is barred by an affirmative defense—are ordinarily deemed ‘waived’ if
the defendant does not raise them in its demurrer or answer to the complaint.”
(Quigley v. Garden Valley Fire Protection Dist. (2019) 7 Cal.5th 798,
807 citing CCP, § 430.80(a).) Because Defendant raised the issue of exclusive
concurrent jurisdiction in its Answer, the court finds that the motion has not
been waived and the court will proceed to address the Motion on the merits. 
 
            B.        Request
for Stay Under Exclusive Concurrent Jurisdiction
 
In Shaw v. Superior Court of
Contra Costa County¿(2022) 78 Cal.App.5th 245, the appellate court found
that a court has the “power to stay a subsequent PAGA representative suit that
is wholly subsumed by a prior PAGA representative suit—i.e., where the second
suit alleges the same Labor Code violations based on the same facts and
theories as the prior suit [.]” (Id. at p. 260.)  
 
The Del Cid Action was filed on
March 26. 2020, whereas this instant action was filed on March 7, 2024. (Defendant’s
RJN, Ex. B.)  In the Del Cid Action, fact
summary closed on January 21, 2022, and on September 12, 2022, the court
ordered Del Cid’s individual PAGA claims to arbitration, currently scheduled
for February 24, 2025. An Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal (Arbitration) is
set for April 2, 2025. On April 16, 2024, the Del Cid court declined to relate
the cases. 
 
Defendant asserts this instant action
arises out of the same Labor Code violations as the Del Cid action but adds two
new allegations (unlawful deductions and failure to reimburse business
expenses). Therefore, because the Labor Code violations are similar and the
allegations are against the same Defendant, Defendant argues that this court
should stay this action because it is substantially the same and arises from
the same transaction or events as the Del Cid Action. 
 
Plaintiff asserts this action
is different because the Plaintiff in this action was employed as a housekeeper
attendant from about February 14, 2020, to about April 24, 2023. Meanwhile, the
plaintiff in the Del Cid Action was employed as a nighttime parking attendant
from May 18, 2005 to September 2019. (Plaintiff’s RJN, Ex. A [Compl.].)
Therefore, the employment periods did not overlap. 
 
In Shaw, the court
stayed the second lawsuit because the claims overlapped, but Defendant fails to
show that the claims in the Del Cid Action overlap with the claims in this
action given that there is no overlap in the period of employment. In other
words, the Defendant fails to show how a judgment or settlement in the Del
Cid Action would bar recovery in this action. For the Del Cid Action to have a
preclusive effect on this action, Plaintiff in this action must be a member of
the plaintiff class covered in the Del Cid Action. (See Villacres v. ABM
Industries Inc. (2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 562, 591; Howitson v. Evans
Hotels, LLC (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 475, 492.)
 
In the absence of such a
showing, the Court fails to see how the Del Cid Action completely subsumes or has
a  preclusive effect on the present
action such that there is a risk of conflicting rulings. “In determining
whether the causes of action are the same for purposes of pleas in abatement,
the rule is that such a plea may be maintained only where a judgment in the
first action would be a complete bar to the second action. (Lord v. Garland
(1946) 27 Cal.2d 840, 848.)  
 
Second, Defendant fails to show
that the Del Cid court has the ability to grant full relief to the Plaintiff in
this action. “[T]he remedies sought in the separate actions need not be
precisely the same so long as the court exercising original jurisdiction has
the power to litigate all the issues and grant all the relief to which any of
the parties might be entitled under the pleadings.” (Plant Insulation Co. v.
Fibreboard Corp. (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 781, 788.) 
 
That Plaintiff is also an
employee of Defendant and alleges substantially similar Labor Code violations
is not sufficient to find that the claims are identical, given that the Labor
Code violations arouse after the events in the Del Cid Action.  Therefore, the court fails to find that the
Labor Code violations in this action “arises out of the same transaction or
events.” (County of Siskiyou v. Superior Court (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th
83, 89.)
 
As Defendant fails to show that
the Del Cid Action would completely bar recovery in the instant action, the
court fails to find that the rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction applies
and requires a stay of this action. 
 
            C.        Request
for Discretionary Stay 
 
“Granting a stay in a case
where the issues in two actions are substantially identical [citation] is a
matter addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court. “ ‘In exercising
its discretion the court should consider the importance of discouraging
multiple litigation designed solely to harass an adverse party, and of avoiding
unseemly conflicts with the courts of other jurisdictions.¿ It should also
consider whether the rights of the parties can best be determined by the court
of the other jurisdiction because of the nature of the subject matter, the
availability of witnesses, or the stage to which the proceedings in the other
court have already advanced.’¿ [Citations.]”¿ (Thomson v. Cont’l Ins. Co. (1967)
66 Cal.2d 738, 746-747.) 
 
That it would be more efficient
for Defendant to complete discovery after the Del Cid Action is adjudicated is
not a sufficient basis to stay this action. Moreover, Defendant fails to
persuade the Court that it should grant a stay given that the instant action is
not duplicative of or subsumed by the Del Cid Action and involves a controversy
that arose after the events in the Del Cid Action. 
More importantly, Defendant
fails to show that the Del Cid Action will grant Plaintiff the requested relief
and that this action is duplicative of the Del Cid Action such that a stay is
warranted to prevent conflicting rulings. Even if the Del Cid Action has a
preclusive effect on this action, the doctrine of collateral estoppel exists to
protect Defendant from any cumulative and/or conflicting PAGA judgments such
that a discretionary stay is not warranted.  
 
Therefore, Defendant’s request
for a discretionary stay is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant’s motion to stay the
action is denied.
