Background
 
On May 1, 2024, Akemi
Minami (“Plaintiff”), individually and derivatively on behalf of Nominal Defendant Bekon Corporation, filed a Complaint against
Wesley Minami (“Wesley”); Raquel Minami (“Raquel”), and Bekon Corporation
(collectively “Defendants”). 
 
The Complaint
alleges ten causes of action: 
1)    
Breach of Fiduciary Duty
(derivatively) – against Defendants Wesley and Raquel;
2)    
Breach of Fiduciary Duty -
against Defendants Wesley and Raquel;
3)    
Fraud - against Defendants
Wesley and Raquel;
4)    
Conversion - against
Defendants Wesley and Raquel;
5)    
Violation of Pen. Code §
496 - against Defendants Wesley and Raquel;
6)    
Violation of corp. Code §
1001 - against Defendants Wesley and Raquel;
7)    
Failure to Permit
Inspection of Records - against Defendants Wesley and Raquel;
8)    
Unjust Enrichment
(individually and derivatively) - against Defendants Wesley and Raquel; and
9)    
Unfair Competition (Bus.
& Prof. Code § 17200) - against Defendants Wesley and Raquel. 
 
Defendants now demurrer to the Complaint. Plaintiff opposes
the demurrer. The matter is now before the court.
 
Demurrer[1]
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect
by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer
must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.¿
(CCP, § 430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) In
evaluating a demurrer, the court accepts the complainant’s properly pled facts
as true and ignores contentions, deductions, and conclusory statements. (Daar
v. Yellow Cab Co. (1976) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713; Serrano v. Priest (1971)
5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) Moreover, the court does not consider whether a plaintiff
will be able to prove the allegations or the possible difficulty in making such
proof. (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d
590, 604.) 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)
 
II.        Discussion
 
A.        Lack of Standing to Assert Derivative
Causes of Action
 
A
derivative action seeks “to enforce the corporation's rights and redress its
injuries when the board of directors fails or refuses to do so.” (Grosset v.
Wenaas (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1100, 1108.) Defendant asserts Plaintiff lacks standing
because she failed to comply with Corp.
Code § 800(b)(2):  
 
(b) No action may be instituted or maintained in right of any
domestic or foreign corporation by any holder of shares or of voting trust
certificates of the corporation unless both of the following conditions
exist: 
 
[ . . . ] 
 
(2) The plaintiff alleges in the complaint with particularity
plaintiff's efforts to secure from the board such action as plaintiff desires,
or the reasons for not making such effort, and alleges further that plaintiff
has either informed the corporation or the board in writing of the ultimate
facts of each cause of action against each defendant or delivered to the
corporation or the board a true copy of the complaint which plaintiff proposes
to file. 
 
(Corp. Code, § 800(b)(2).)
 
“Demand on the board will be excused only when
plaintiff sufficiently alleges the demand would have been futile.’ (Patrick
v. Alacer Corp. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 995, 1004.) Conclusory allegations
are “insufficient to
establish demand futility.” (Bader v. Anderson (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th
775, 797.) 
 
Plaintiff does not
dispute the fact that she failed to present a demand to the Bekon Board.
However, the Complaint alleges that such a task would have been futile because
Defendants Wesley and Raquel are the officers who control the Bekon board, and
Raquel owns a majority of Bekon’s shares such that “any attempt by Plaintiff to
make a demand on the management of Bekon to pursue its valid claims against
Wesley and Raquel would be futile. “ (Compl., ¶ 29.) 
 
The court finds that
Plaintiff sufficiently alleges that notice to the Bekon Board would have been
futile given that “the sole officers of Bekon were and are Masaru, Wesley,
Raquel, and more recently Maria Minami.” (Compl., ¶ 22.) Therefore, Plaintiff
has standing to bring a derivative action, and the demurrer is overruled on
this basis. 
 
B.        Plaintiff’s Ability to Allege Both
Direct and Derivative Claims
 
Defendant asserts that
Plaintiff cannot simultaneously allege both a direct and derivative claim that
arise out of the same alleged misconduct. “[A] stockholder may sue as an
individual where he is directly and individually injured although the corporation
may also have a cause of action for the same wrong.” (Sutter v. General
Petroleum Corp. (1946) 28 Cal.2d 525, 530; see also Corrections USA v.
Dawe (E.D. Cal. 2007) 504 F.Supp.2d 924, 931 [“If a stockholder suffered
injuries that are separate and distinct from those injuries suffered by the
corporation, in some circumstances, both the corporation and individual may
bring suit.”].) 
 
As a matter of law, the
Plaintiff may plead both direct and derivative causes of action arising from
the same wrong so long as she and the corporation suffer an injury. As the
party seeking a demurrer, Defendant bears the burden of showing that the injuries
alleged in the Complaint either belong to the corporation or affect only the
personal rights of the Plaintiff, precluding the simultaneous allegation
of both direct and derivative claims. (See Hilliard v. Harbour (2017) 12
Cal.App.5th 1006, 1012.) “In determining whether an individual action as
opposed to a derivative action lies, a court looks at ‘the gravamen of the
wrong alleged in the pleadings.’ ” (PacLink Communications Intern., Inc. v.
Superior Court (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 958, 965 citing Nelson v. Anderson
(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 124.) 
 
The court will not
sustain a demurrer to the first, second, third, sixth, eighth, and ninth causes
of action on the wrongful premise that the Plaintiff cannot simultaneously
plead a direct and derivative cause of action as a matter of law. The burden is
on Defendants to show the court that on the face of the pleadings,
Plaintiff’s claims are either direct or derivative, but not both because the
injury is to either the corporation or Plaintiff, but not both. Defendants
failed to do so. More importantly, the only derivative claim brought by
Plaintiff is the first cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty and
Defendants fail to allege or show that it is inadequately pled. 
 
The demurrer is
overruled on this basis. 
 
C.        Sixth Cause of Action Violation of Corp.
Code 
 
Plaintiff alleges that
Defendants as Bekon’s Board violated Corp. Code § 1001 by disposing of
substantially all of Bekon’s assents “outside the usual and regular course of
its business on two separate occasions; first when it sold the Fairview
Property, and then when it used the proceeds of such sale to purchase the North
Carolina Property.” (Compl., ¶ 64.) Corp. Code § 1001(a) states: 
 
(a) A corporation may sell, lease,
convey, exchange, transfer, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of
its assets when the principal terms are approved by the board, and, unless the
transaction is in the usual and regular course of its business, approved by the
outstanding shares (Section 152), either before or after approval by the board
and before or after the transaction. A transaction constituting a
reorganization (Section 181) is subject to the provisions of Chapter 12
(commencing with Section 1200) and not this section (other than subdivision
(d)). A transaction constituting a conversion (Section 161.9) is subject to the
provisions of Chapter 11.5 (commencing with Section 1150) and not this section.


The Complaint alleges
that Plaintiff is the minority shareholder of Bekon because she only received
23.3% of Bekon’s shares. (Compl., ¶¶ 7, 13.) The remaining majority of Bekon’s
shares are owned by Defendants. (Id., ¶ 7.) After the Beacon Hotel was
condemned in 1974, the corporation changed its name to Bekon Corporation and
purchased a 38-unit apartment building in Boyle Heights, CA (the Fairview
Property”). (Id., ¶ 6.) Unbeknownst to Plaintiff, on March 13, 2024,
Defendants sold the Fair View Property for $4,995,000 and used the proceeds to
purchase a property in North Carolina. (Id., 15.) The purchase was
approved with the unanimous consent of Bekon’s Board. (Id., ¶ 18.) 
 
The purpose of Corp.
Code § 1001(a) is to ensure that the corporation continues its corporate
purpose: 
 
‘The reason for this limitation is that a
corporation is organized for the purpose of doing business of some nature, and,
if so, its shareholders have the right to insist that the corporation continue
for the purpose for which it was organized. A sale, therefore, of all its
property, or so much thereof as would prevent it from continuing in such
business, would constitute a violation of the corporate contract. [Citation] To
this rule there are * * * exceptions. * * * If the conversion of all assets
into cash * * * is in furtherance of the business for which the corporation was
organized, the transaction is not ultra vires. For instance, if a corporation
is organized for the purpose of buying, selling, and dealing in real estate, it
would naturally have the power to sell all the real estate it owned at a
particular time because that is the very object of its organization. The sale
of its tangible assets under such circumstances furthers rather than hinders
the carrying out of its contract  with
its stockholders. * * *’ [Citation.] . . . the test which determines the
question of the necessity for consent of the stockholder is, ‘whether the sale
is in the regular course of the business of the corporation and in furtherance
of the express objects of its existence, or something outside of the normal and
regular course of the business. * * *
 
(Jeppi v. Brockman
Holding Co. (1949) 34 Cal.2d 11, 15–16.) 
 
Plaintiff asserts that
through the rental of the Fairview Property, the Bekon received approximately
$300,000 per year. (Compl., ¶ 21.) 
 
To find that the
purchase of the North Carolina Property hindered the business purpose of the
Bekon corporation, Plaintiff must allege facts showing that the North Carolina
property renders no profits, and its purchase was a transaction that fell
outside the regular course of Bekon’s business and was not in furtherance of
Bekon’s existence. The fact that Plaintiff was unaware of the sale of the
Fairview Property is insufficient to assert liability under section 1001.
Conclusory statements without specific facts showing why the sale of the
Fairview Property and acquisition of the North Carolina Property violate
section 1001 are also insufficient. Plaintiff must allege facts to show why the
sale of Fairview Property, and the purchase of the North Carolina Property were
wrongful. 
 
The demurrer to the
sixth cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
D.        Third Cause of Action – Fraud 
 
“The elements of fraud, which give rise to the
tort action for deceit, are (a) misrepresentation (false representation,
concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c)
intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e)
resulting damage.” (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631,
638.) “In California, fraud must be pled specifically; general and conclusory
allegations do not suffice.” (Id. at p. 645.) Specificity “necessitates
pleading facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the
representations were tendered.” (Id. at p. 631.)
 
Defendants demur to the
third cause of action on the basis that it is not pled with the requisite
specificity. 
 
The Complaint alleges
that Defendant Wesley, on behalf of himself and Raquel, intentionally failed to
tell Plaintiff about the sale of the Fairview Property until the after property
was scheduled to close. (Compl., ¶ 44.) Defendant Wesley also intentionally
concealed the purchase of the North Carolina Property, until after the
transaction had closed. (Id., ¶ 45.) 
The Complaint alleges that due to Defendants’ concealment of the above
transactions, Plaintiff relied on the misrepresentations by failing to take
immediate action to enjoin Bekon from proceeding with the transactions,
including seeking injunctive relief. (Compl., ¶ 50) 
 
The court finds that
Plaintiff fails to plead the element of reliance to support a claim for fraud.
Plaintiff as a minority shareholder could not enjoin the transactions at issue
because she was not a Bekon Board member. Moreover, Plaintiff fails to state
under what basis Plaintiff would be entitled to seek injunctive relief, when
there are no facts showing that the transactions were improper, that the Bekon
Board acted without authority, or in violation of Corp. Code § 1001. 
 
The demurrer to the
third cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
E.        Fourth Cause of Action – Conversion
 
To plead a cause of
action for conversion, one must allege (1) the plaintiff’s ownership or right
to possession of personal property; (2) defendant’s disposition of the property
inconsistent with plaintiff’s rights; and (3) resulting damages. (Fremont
Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General Corp.(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,
119.) “Money may be the subject of conversion if the claim involves a
specific, identifiable sum . . . .” (WelcoElectronics, Inc. v. Mora(2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 202, 209.) 
 
Defendants assert that
the conversion claim fails because Plaintiff fails to identify the specific sum
at issue. The court agrees. The Complaint alleges that Defendants “causing
Plaintiff to be deprived of payments and proceeds in specific amounts[.]” (Compl.,
54.) 
 
Plaintiff fails to
explain if her right to entitlement stems from the rental proceeds of the
Fairview Property or officer compensation payments. She also fails to allege
what the specific sum due is or that it is capable of becoming identifiable. 
 
The demurrer to the
fourth cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
F.        Fifth Cause of Action – Violation of
Pen. Code § 496
 
Penal
Code § 496(c) allows any person injured by receipt of stolen property under
Penal Code § 496(a) to “bring an action for three times the amount of actual
damages, if any, sustained by the plaintiff, costs of suit, and reasonable
attorney’s fees.” (Pen. Code, § 496(a).)  
 
The California Supreme Court in Siry
Investment, L.P. v. Farkhondehpour (2022) 13 Cal.5th 333 determined that to
prevail under Penal Code § 496 Plaintiff must prove “theft” as defined by Penal
Code § 484 and not common law fraud. To prove theft, a plaintiff must establish
criminal intent on the part of the defendant beyond ‘mere proof of
nonperformance or actual falsity.’ ” (Id. at 361-362 citing People v.
Ashley (1954) 42 Cal.2d 246, 264.) 
 
Penal Code § 484(a) defines theft as:  
 
(a) Every person
who  
[1] shall
feloniously steal, take, carry, lead, or drive away the personal property of
another, or  
[2] shall
fraudulently appropriate property which has been entrusted to him or her...,
or  
[3] shall
knowingly and designedly, by any false or fraudulent representation or
pretense, defraud any other person of ¿money, labor or real or personal property... is guilty of theft.  
 
Plaintiff fails to allege facts to show that Defendants acted with
the requisite felonious intent to commit theft. The Plaintiff also fails
to identify what specific property was stolen. Therefore, the demurrer to the
fifth cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
G.        Eighth Cause of Action – Unjust Enrichment 
 
“[T]here is no cause of action
in California for unjust enrichment. The phrase ‘Unjust Enrichment’ does not
describe a theory of recovery, but an effect: the result of a failure to make
restitution under circumstances where it is equitable to do so. [Citation]
Unjust enrichment is ‘a general principle, underlying various legal doctrines
and remedies, rather than a remedy itself.’ [Citation.] It is synonymous with
restitution. (Melchior v. New Line Cinema (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th
779, 793 [internal quotations omitted].) While there is no cause of action in
California labeled “unjust enrichment”, an unjust enrichment claim can be made,
and the remedy is grounded in equitable principles of restitution. (See Sepanossian
v. National Ready Mix Company, Inc. (2023) 97 Cal.App.5th 192.) 
 
The Complaint seeks
restitution for Defendants’ breach of fiduciary duty and self-dealing and
payment of improper dividends. (Compl., ¶ 74.) Plaintiff cites case law showing
that claims for unjust enrichment have been permitted as a way of seeking
restitution. (See Elder v. Pacific Bell Telephone Co. (2012) 205
Cal.App.4th 841, 857; see County of San Bernardino v. Walsh (2007) 158
Cal.App.4th 533, 541.)
 
As Plaintiff has
adequately pled a claim for unjust enrichment, the court overrules the demurrer
to the eighth cause of action. 
 
H.        Ninth Cause of Action – Unfair
Competition Law
 
Business and Professions Code § 17200 (“UCL”) prohibits “any
unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.”¿(Bus. & Prof.
Code, § 17200;¿see Clark v. Superior Court¿(2010) 50 Cal.4th 605, 610.)
To plead this statutory claim, the pleadings must state with reasonable
particularity the facts supporting the statutory elements of the violation. (Khoury
v. Maly's of California, Inc.¿(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 619.) 
 
“An unlawful business practice or act is an act or practice,
committed pursuant to business activity, that is at the same time forbidden by
law.” (Klein v. Earth Elements, Inc. (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 965, 969.) “A
business practice is unfair within the meaning of the UCL if it violates
established public policy or if it is immoral, unethical, oppressive or
unscrupulous and causes injury to consumers which outweighs its benefits.” (McKell
v. Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1473.) Lastly, a
fraudulent business practice claims under section 17200 “is not based upon
proof of the common law tort of deceit or deception, but is instead premised on
whether the public is likely to be deceived.” (Pastoria v. Nationwide Ins.
(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1490, 1499.) 
 
Defendant asserts that the ninth
cause of action fails because Plaintiff’s claims for breach of fiduciary duty,
fraud, and conversion fail. A demurrer must dispose of an entire cause of
action to be sustained. (PH II, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 33
Cal.App.4th 1680, 1682.) As Plaintiff’s breach of fiduciary duty claim remains
viable so does her UCL claim. 
 
Accordingly, the
demurrer to the ninth cause of action is overruled. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants’ demurrer is sustained with
leave to amend as to the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth 
causes of action and overruled as to the
first, second, eighth, and ninth causes of action. Plaintiff 
is granted 10 days leave to amend. The
court sets a Non-Appearance OSC RE: Amended 
Complaint for November 18, 2024, at 8:30
a.m. Defendant to give notice.
