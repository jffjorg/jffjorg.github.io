And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Jonathan Club, has moved to stay the action brought by Maria Soto, a representative of aggrieved employees, under the rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction. The defendant argues that the case is substantially the same as an earlier-filed PAGA action, Joaquin Del Cid Jr. v. Jonathan Club, and that a stay is necessary to avoid conflicting rulings.

The court disagrees, finding that the two cases are not identical and that the defendant has failed to show that the Del Cid Action would completely bar recovery in the instant action. The court also finds that the defendant has failed to show that the Del Cid Action would grant the plaintiff the requested relief and that this action is not duplicative of or subsumed by the Del Cid Action.

Therefore, the court denies the defendant's request for a stay under the rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction and also denies the request for a discretionary stay. The court finds that the defendant has not shown sufficient grounds to warrant a stay and that the action should proceed.
