Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the case based on forum non conveniens. The case arises from a helicopter crash in New Zealand in 2021, and the plaintiff, Lynda Harrap, is a New Zealand resident who was injured in the crash. The defendant, Robinson Helicopter Company, Inc., is a California corporation that manufactured the helicopter. The judge has determined that New Zealand is a suitable alternative forum for the case because New Zealand has a strong connection to the accident, including the location of the crash, the registration of the helicopter, and the pilot's licensure. The judge has also found that the private interest factors favor trial in New Zealand because New Zealand has the strongest connection to the case, and the lack of compulsory process to secure the attendance of New Zealand witnesses and third-party defendants in the U.S. makes it difficult to compel testimony crucial to the defendant's case. Finally, the judge has determined that the public interest weighs in favor of granting the motion because New Zealand has a stronger interest in the litigation than California does.
