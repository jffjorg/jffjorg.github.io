```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the evidence and finds that the defendant, Bird Rides Inc., has met its burden to demonstrate the existence of an arbitration agreement between the parties that covers the plaintiff's claims. The plaintiff, Coleman, has failed to demonstrate that the agreement is unconscionable.

The court notes that the Bird Rental Agreement, which includes an arbitration agreement, was presented to Coleman in a clear and conspicuous manner on the Bird App. Coleman signed up for the app, rented an electric scooter, and agreed to the terms and conditions, including the arbitration agreement.

The court finds that the arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable under California and federal law. The court grants the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and orders the plaintiff's claims to be resolved through arbitration. The entire action is stayed pending the completion of the arbitration. A status conference is set for October 11, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
