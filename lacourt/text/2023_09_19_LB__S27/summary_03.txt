**English Summary:**

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by LACMTA against a cross-complaint filed by the City of Los Angeles. The demurrer argues that the cross-complaint is legally insufficient.

The judge found that LACMTA did not adequately meet and confer with the City before filing the demurrer, so the hearing is continued for six weeks to allow for further discussions between the parties.

The judge also noted that the City claims it served the cross-complaint on LACMTA one week late and is considering requesting leave to file a late claim. The judge encourages the parties to resolve these issues through further meet and confer discussions before the next hearing.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by LACMTA against the City's cross-complaint. The judge finds that LACMTA's meet and confer attempts were insufficient and orders the parties to meet and confer in good faith within the next three weeks. If the parties are unable to come to an agreement, each party must file a meet and confer declaration and a brief detailing what issues remain unresolved. The judge notes that it is inclined to consider the demurrer on its merits, as it is in the interest of justice to have all legal issues resolved at the outset of litigation. The judge also notes that the City's claim was served one week late and that there is a process for filing a late claim, but the judge is not familiar with any authority permitting the City to ask for leave to file a late claim in opposition to a demurrer. The parties are reminded that there is a Case Management Conference scheduled concurrently with the hearing on the demurrer, and the judge asks the parties to make arrangements to appear remotely at the conference and hearing.
