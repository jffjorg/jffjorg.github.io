 Case Number:  22LBCV00852    Hearing Date:   September 19, 2023    Dept:  S27 1.    
Demurrer
The Court was originally scheduled to hear this demurrer on 8/10/23.  The Court issued a tentative ruling
sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend in light of Plaintiff’s failure to
file opposition to the demurrer.  
 
Plaintiff appeared at the hearing and indicated she had not received the moving
papers from her former attorney, who had withdrawn from representation.  She sought a continuance of the hearing to permit
her to file opposition papers.  The Court
granted the continuance and rescheduled the hearing for 9/19/23.
 
Plaintiff filed timely opposition papers, per the order, on 8/31/23.  Her opposition, however, abruptly cuts off on
page 8.  It appears clear that her
opposition papers are more than eight pages long, but the remainder of the
document was not filed.  Notably,
Plaintiff had only begun addressing the arguments advanced in the demurrer on
page seven of her opposition.  The Court wishes
to read and consider Plaintiff’s full opposition before ruling on the demurrer.  
 
The hearing on the demurrer is continued to Thursday, 10/19/23 at 8:30
a.m. in Department S27.  Plaintiff must file
her full opposition to the demurrer by Thursday, 9/28/23.  Defendant must file its reply by Tuesday,
10/10/23.  
 
2.    
Discovery
Motions
The Court notes that the parties
have motions to compel further responses (filed by Bank of America) scheduled
for 9/21/23, 9/26/23, 9/28/23, and 10/03/23, and a motion for terminating
sanctions (filed by John Canas) is scheduled for 11/28/23.  
 
In the event the Court ultimately
sustains Bank of America’s demurrer without leave to amend, its discovery
motions will be moot.  The Court
therefore continues the hearing on all four of its motions to 11/28/23, to be
heard concurrently with Canas’s motion for terminating sanctions.  
3.     Case
Management Conference
The parties are reminded that there
is a CMC on calendar concurrently with the hearing on the above demurrer.  The Court asks the parties to make arrangements
to appear remotely at the CMC and hearing on the demurrer.
