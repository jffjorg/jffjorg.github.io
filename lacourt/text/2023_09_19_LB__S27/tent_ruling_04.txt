 Case Number:  22STCV02259    Hearing Date:   September 19, 2023    Dept:  S27 Plaintiff, Lea Encarnacion filed
this action against Defendants, Conair Corporation, et al. for damages arising
out of injuries sustained when Plaintiff was working as a hair model and a hair
bleaching product was applied to her scalp. 

 
At this time, Conair seeks leave to
file a cross-complaint against Transom Symphony Opco, LLC d/b/a Beauty Quest
Group for indemnification and related claims. 

 
A cross-complaint against any of
the parties who filed the initial complaint or cross-complaint against the
cross-complainant must be filed before or at the same time as the answer to the
initial complaint or cross-complaint, which answer must be filed within 30 days
of service of the complaint or cross-complaint. 
(CCP §§ 412.20(a)(3), 428.50(a), 432.10.)  Any other cross-complaint may be filed at any
time before the court has set a trial date. 
(CCP §428.50(b).)  If a party
fails to file a cross-complaint within the time limits described above, he or
she must obtain permission from the court to file the cross-complaint.  (CCP §§ 426.50, 428.50(c).)  Permission to file a permissive cross-complaint
may be granted in the interest of justice at any time during the course of the
action.  (CCP § 428.50(c).)
 
Conair has properly served all
parties with a copy of this motion, and no party has opposed the motion.  Trial is not scheduled until 11/27/23, and
therefore no party will be prejudiced by the filing of the cross-complaint.  Conair is ordered to file a separate copy of
the cross-complaint within five days.  
 
Counsel are reminded that there is
a Case Management Conference and OSC re: Failure to File Proof of Service on
calendar concurrently with the hearing on the above motion for leave.  The Court asks Counsel to make arrangements
to appear remotely at the hearing.
