## English Summary:

The judge has tentatively decided to continue the hearing on a demurrer filed by Bank of America against the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff initially missed the deadline to oppose the demurrer because she didn't receive the necessary documents from her former attorney. While she has since filed an opposition, it was incomplete.  

The judge wants to review the full opposition before making a decision. The hearing is now rescheduled for October 19th, with a deadline for the Plaintiff to submit the complete opposition.

The judge also notes that several other motions are scheduled, including  Bank of America's motions to compel further responses and a motion for terminating sanctions filed by John Canas. If the judge sustains Bank of America's demurrer, these motions will be moot. As a result, the judge is continuing all these motions to November 28th, where they will be heard together.
