```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to set aside the default. The defendant had filed an answer to the complaint after the default had been entered, and argued that their failure to timely answer was due to their counsel's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. However, the judge found that the motion was untimely, as it was filed more than six months after the default was entered. The judge also noted that the defendant's counsel had tried to settle the case prior to the entry of default, which suggests that the default was not caused by mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. As a result, the judge has denied the motion to set aside the default and has stricken the defendant's answer filed after the default was entered.
