APPLICATION
FOR ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE WHY CONTEMPT SANCTIONS SHOULD NOT ISSUE AS TO JOHN
PIERCE AND DAVID SERGENIAN



 
MOVING PARTY:               Petitioner
Darin Beffa 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Respondents John
Pierce and David Sergenian
 
 
I.          FACTUAL AND
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from a wrongful termination from
employment at a law firm.  In January
2017, John Pierce (“Pierce”) and David Sergenian (“Sergenian”) co-founded the
law firm of Pierce Sergenian LLP (“PS LLP”). 
Darin Beffa (“Beffa”) was a partner at PS LLP until his alleged wrongful
termination.  In November 2017, Sergenian
resigned from PS LLP.  The law firm of
Pierce Bainbridge Beck Price & Hecht LLP (“Pierce Bainbridge”) succeeded PS
LLP.  
 
On May 3, 2019, Beffa instituted an arbitration before the
AAA.  Beffa named Pierce, Sergenian, and
Pierce Bainbridge as respondents.[1]
 Robert Hoffman was appointed as the
Arbitrator.   Thereafter, a dispute arose
over which party was to pay the arbitrator’s fee.  
 
On April 9, 2020, after ordering briefing on the issue,
Arbitrator Hoffman determined that all Respondents were responsible for paying
the arbitrator’s compensation.  On January
15, 2021, AAA notified Beffa’s counsel and counsel for Pierce Bainbridge that
Arbitrator Hoffman had requested an additional $11,000 from the employer as a
deposit for anticipated arbitrator compensation.  Pierce Bainbridge failed to pay the
deposit.  As a result, AAA terminated the
arbitration proceeding.  
 
On March 8, 2022, Petitioner, Darin Beffa, filed a petition
to compel arbitration and payment of arbitration fees against Pierce, Sergenian,
and Pierce Bainbridge.  The petition
sought an order requiring Respondents to pay the deposits requested by
Arbitrator Hoffman and all required fees during the pendency of arbitration.  Sergenian opposed the petition on the grounds
that the April 9, 2020 order required the employer to pay the arbitration fee
which, in this case, was Pierce Bainbridge, not Sergenian individually.
 
On October 3, 2022, the court granted the petition and
directed Respondents to pay the arbitration fees consistent with Arbitrator
Hoffman’s April 9, 2020 order.  The court
also suggested that Sergenian seek clarification from Arbitrator Hoffman
whether the April 9, 2020 order was intended to require Sergenian to pay
arbitration fees assessed to Pierce Bainbridge.
 
On January 9, 2023, Beffa’s counsel requested AAA and
Arbitrator Hoffman to reopen the arbitration and to reissue an invoice for any
outstanding arbitration fees.  Sergenian
separately requested clarification as to the specific party responsible for
arbitration fees.  
 
On January 12, 2023, AAA responded to Beffa and Sergenian
and informed them that AAA had purged their files and requested Beffa to refile
the arbitration.  AAA also stated that
Arbitrator Hoffman would only be the arbitrator for the new dispute if the
parties so requested.  In a separate
communication, Arbitrator Hoffman confirmed that he did not have jurisdiction
over the matter.  
 
fOn the same day, Beffa filed a new arbitration against
Pierce, Pierce Bainbridge and Sergenian. 
On January 18, 2023, AAA sent a letter to the parties determining the
employer would bear $2,100 in initial arbitration fees.  Pierce Bainbridge failed to pay the fees. 
 
On December 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed this Application for
Order to Show Cause Why Contempt Sanctions Shound Not Issue as to John Pierce
and David Sergenian for their alleged failure to comply with the court’s
October 3, 2023 order to pay for the arbitration fees.
 
On January 31, 2024, Sergenian filed an opposition.  Pierce did not file an opposition.  
 
Plaintiff did not file a reply.
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARDS
 
            Contempt is
any act, in or out of court, “which tends to impede, embarrass or obstruct the
court in the discharge of its duties.”  (In re Shortridge (1893) 99
Cal. 526, 532.)  Particular acts constituting contempt are enumerated by
statute, including:¿ “(d)isobedience of any lawful ... order, or process of the
court”;¿ “(d)isobedience of a subpoena duly served”; “refusing to ... answer as
a witness”;¿ “(d)isorderly, contemptuous, or insolent behavior toward the judge
while holding the court, tending to interrupt the due course of ...
trial.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1209, subd. (a); see also Code Civ. Proc., §
1991 [disobedience of subpoena]; and Pen. Code, § 166 [misdemeanor].) 
 
            In this
case involving the disobedience of a prior court order, the contempt at issue
is “indirect,” which requires a more elaborate procedure to notify the
person(s) sought to be charged and to allow him or her an opportunity to be
heard.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1211-1218; see also Hanson v. Superior
Court (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 75, 81.) “An affidavit must be presented
to the court stating the facts constituting the contempt, an order to show
cause must be issued, and hearing on the facts must be held by the
judge.”  Arthur v. Superior Court (1965) 62 Cal.2d 404, 407-408.) Since
the acts involved did not occur in the court’s presence, the affidavit
(declaration) must cover each element of the commission of the
contempt. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1211.5.) These elements are: (1) the
rendition of a valid court order; (2) actual knowledge of the order; (3)
ability to comply; and (4) willful disobedience of the order.  (Conn v.
Superior Court (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 774, 784 [repeated failures to turn
over documents as ordered].)  Upon receipt of the affidavit, the court
usually issues an order to show cause (OSC) why the person should not be held
in contempt.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1212.)  Subsequently, upon review of the answer and
evidence, “the court or judge shall determine whether the person proceeded
against is guilty of the contempt charged, and if it be adjudged that he or she
is guilty of the contempt, a fine may be imposed on him or her not exceeding
one thousand dollars ($1,000), payable to the court, or he or she may be imprisoned
not exceeding five days, or both.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1218, subd. (a).) 
            
III.       DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff seeks an order for the court to set contempt
proceedings arising from Respondents’ failure to comply with the court’s October
3, 2022 order.  
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion for Contempt is substantively deficient. 
The court’s October 3, 2022 order intended to enforce Arbitrator
Hoffman’s April 9, 2020 order that Respondents were to pay the fees.  After Plaintiff refiled arbitration against
Respondents, AAA indicated that Arbitrator Hoffman was not assigned to this
matter.  (Sergenian Decl., Ex. 16.)  In 2023, Arbitrator Hoffman stated he did not
have jurisdiction in the matter. 
(Sergenian Decl, Ex. 17.)  Because
Plaintiff’s filed a new arbitration and Judge Hoffman lacks jurisdiction, there
is no operative and current fee order in place.  Plaintiff cannot show indirect contempt.  “A most basic premise in the law of [indirect]
contempt is that such punishment can only rest upon clear, intentional
violation of a specific, narrowly drawn order.” 
(Wilson v. Superior Ct. (1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 1259.)  Plaintiff did not file a reply.  Plaintiff does not present any argument to
the contrary.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            The Application for Order to Show Cause Why Contempt
Sanctions Shound Not Issue as to John Pierce and David Sergenian is DENIED.[2]  
 
            Moving
party to give notice, unless waived.
