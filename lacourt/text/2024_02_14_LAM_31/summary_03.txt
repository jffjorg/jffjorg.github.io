And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Kia America, Inc.'s motion for summary adjudication of the third and fourth causes of action, which alleged fraudulent concealment and intentional misrepresentation. The judge found that Kia did not owe a duty to disclose material facts to the plaintiff, Hermelinda Alvarez, because there was no direct dealing between them. The judge also found that the plaintiff did not establish any intentional misrepresentations made by Kia that induced her purchase of the vehicle. As a result, the judge granted summary adjudication of the third and fourth causes of action and the claim for punitive damages.
