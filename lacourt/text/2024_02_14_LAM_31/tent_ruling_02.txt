MOTION
TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
Chun Wai Tommy Ngan
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On August 17, 2021, Plaintiff, Y & Y Properties, LLC, filed
a Complaint against Defendant, Chun Wai Tommy Ngan, for Breaches of Personal
Guaranty.  As alleged, Defendant entered
into a written industrial/commercial multi-tenant lease as a guarantor for property
at 522 Gladys Ave., Los Angeles, CA, 90013 and thereafter failed to pay the
required monthly rent.
 
On August 31, 2021, Defendant was personally served with the
summons and complaint.
 
            On January 7,
2022, default was entered against Defendant. 

 
            On February
1, 2022, Defendant filed an Answer to the Complaint.  The Answer was not rejected.  Thereafter, the parties participated in case management
conferences.
 
 On February 7, 2022,
the court found this case was related to Case No. 21STCV17375. 
 
            On June 1,
2023, the court noted that Defendant’s Answer was filed after Defendant’s
default had been entered.  The court set an
Order to Show Cause Re: Status of Default and an Order to Show Cause Re: Why
the Court should not Strike Defendant’s Answer. 
The hearings were set for July 7, 2023. 
 
            On July 7,
2023, neither Defendant nor Defendant’s counsel appeared at the hearing.  The court continued the OSCs to October 18,
2023.
 
On October 18, 2023, Defendant filed this motion to set aside the default under Code
of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).  On the same day, the court discharged the OSCs.  The court did not strike Defendant’s Answer.
 
On January 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition.  Defendant did not reply.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (b) provides that a court may “relieve a party or his or her
legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding
taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.”  In addition, a court must vacate a default or
dismissal when a motion for relief under Section 473, subdivision (b) is filed
timely and accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to the
attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect “unless the court finds
that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney’s mistake,
inadvertence, surprise or neglect.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd.
(b).)   
 
The party or the legal
representative must seek such relief “within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was
taken.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); see Rappleyea v. Campbell
(1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 980 [“because more than six months had elapsed from the
entry of default, and hence relief under section 473 was unavailable”]; People
v. The North River Ins. Co. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 712, 721 [motion for
relief under section 473 must be brought “within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months”].)   
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
Defendant seeks relief to vacate the default on the
following grounds: (1) defense counsel actively sought to settle the case prior
to the entry of default; (2) defense counsel tried to file an answer on the day
default was entered but the pleading was rejected because of the default, and (3)
defense counsel realizes in hindsight he should have filed a timely answer but
did not do so in part because of stress caused by counsel’s father’s illness.  (Zargarof Decl., ¶¶ 2-10.)  For these reasons, Defendant argues his
failure to timely answer the Complaint was the result of his counsel’s mistake,
inadvertence, surprise and excusable neglect. 

 
Defendant is not entitled to relief under CCP section 473(b).  As Plaintiff correctly argues, Defendant’s
motion is untimely.  The party or the legal representative must
seek such relief “within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months,
after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); see Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th
975, 980 [“because more than six months had elapsed from the entry of default,
and hence relief under section 473 was unavailable”]; People v. The North
River Ins. Co. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 712, 721 [motion for relief under
section 473 must be brought “within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six
months”].)  Here, Defendant seeks to set aside the default more than
twenty-two months after default was entered. 

 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
The motion to set aside default is DENIED.  Defendant’s answer filed February 1, 2022 is
stricken.  
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
 
Dated:   February 14,
2024
