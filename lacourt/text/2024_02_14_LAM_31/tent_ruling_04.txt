[1] Given
the Court’s ruling, the Court need not and does not address the economic loss
rule.  


[2]
Plaintiff cites Dagher v. Ford Motor Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 905, 928
(Dagher) for the proposition that a warranty establishes a transactional
relationship.  Dagher does not
stand for this proposition.  Dagher
involved the question whether a purchaser of a used vehicle at a private sale
had standing to bring suit under the Song-Beverly Act.  The plaintiff in Dagher did not sue
for fraud, and the court did not address the question of the existence of a transactional
relationship between Ford and the plaintiff. 



[3] OCM Principal, supra; Varwig v. Anderson-Behel
Porsche/Audi, Inc. (1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 578; Geernaert v. Mitchell
(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 601; and Barnhouse v. City of Pinole (1982) 133
Cal.App.3d 171.


[4] This section states: “The maker of a fraudulent
misrepresentation is subject to liability for pecuniary loss to another who
acts in justifiable reliance upon it if the misrepresentation, although not
made directly to the other, is made to a third person and the maker intends or
has reason to expect that its terms will be repeated or its substance
communicated to the other, and that it will influence his conduct in the
transaction or type of transaction involved.” 
 


[5] For this
reason, the Court rejects Plaintiff’s argument challenging the procedural
defect of Kia’s Separate Statement, which does not include punitive damages as
an issue for adjudication.
