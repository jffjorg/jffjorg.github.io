And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling is a denial of the plaintiff's application for an order to show cause why contempt sanctions should not issue against John Pierce and David Sergenian for their alleged failure to comply with the court's October 3, 2022 order to pay arbitration fees. The court finds that the plaintiff's motion is substantively deficient because the October 3, 2022 order was intended to enforce Arbitrator Hoffman's April 9, 2020 order, which is no longer operative since the plaintiff refiled arbitration and AAA indicated that Arbitrator Hoffman lacks jurisdiction. The court concludes that the plaintiff cannot show indirect contempt because there is no current and specific order that the respondents failed to comply with.
