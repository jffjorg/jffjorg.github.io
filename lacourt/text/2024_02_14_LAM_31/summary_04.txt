And here is the English text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the defendant Kia's procedural defect in its Separate Statement, which does not include punitive damages as an issue for adjudication. The court rejects the plaintiff's argument challenging this defect, citing case law such as Dagher v. Ford Motor Co. (2015) and Varwig v. Anderson-Behel Porsche/Audi, Inc. (1977). The court also addresses the issue of whether a warranty establishes a transactional relationship, citing Geernaert v. Mitchell (1995) and Barnhouse v. City of Pinole (1982). The ruling notes that the maker of a fraudulent misrepresentation is subject to liability for pecuniary loss, as stated in the California Civil Code.
