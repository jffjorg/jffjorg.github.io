         vs.
 
LOS CIPOTES SALVADOREAN GRILL,
  et al.


 Case No.: 
  21STCV12073 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  March 7, 2024

Los Cipotes Restaurant Bakery is granted in the amount of $323,105.00 in attorneys’ fees (without multiplier) and costs
of $32,736.99. 

 
Plaintiff
Elizabeth Escobar (“Escobar”) (“Plaintiff”) moves for an order awarding her
attorneys’ fees and costs against Defendants Los Cipotes Salvadorean Grill
(“Grill”) and Los Cipotes Restaurant Bakery (“Bakery”) (collectively, “Los Cipotes”).  (Notice of Motion, pgs. i-ii.)  Plaintiff requests fees and costs in the
amount of $678,946.99.  (Notice of Motion, pg. i; Gov. Code
§12965(b); CRC, Rule 3.1702.)
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
Los
Cipotes’ 2/20/24 request for judicial notice of (1) Guerrero v. Pendleton
2024 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18296* (D-RJN, Exh. A); and (2) Marcias v. Lange
2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86901* (D-RJN, Exh. B), is granted. 
Los
Cipotes’ 2/20/24 request for judicial notice of “Legal Trends Report 2023”
Published by Themis Solutions, Inc. (D-RJN, Exh. C), is denied.
 
CRC
Violation
CRC,
Rule 3.1113(d) states, in part:
Except in a summary judgment or summary
adjudication motion, no opening or responding memorandum may exceed 15 pages. .
. . The page limit does not include the caption page, the notice of motion and
motion, exhibits, declarations, attachments, the table of contents, the table
of authorities, or the proof of service.
 
(CRC, Rule 3.1113(d).)
CRC,
Rule 3.113(g) provides, “[a] memorandum that exceeds the page limits of these
rules must be filed and considered in the same manner as a late-filed paper.”
Plaintiff’s
motion violates CRC, Rule 3.1113(d) because it is sixteen pages long and
therefore exceeds the page limits of these rules. Plaintiff’s overlong motion
is filed and considered in the same manner as a late-filed paper.  The Court in its discretion will consider
Plaintiff’s motion.
 
Background
On March 30, 2021, Plaintiff
filed her Complaint against Defendants Los Cipotes and Carlos Mendez Mejia
(“Mejia”) (collectively, “Defendants”) for seventeen causes of action: (1)
Assault; (2) Battery; (3) Sexual Battery; (4) Discrimination; (5) Harassment;
(6) Retaliation; (7) Failure to Prevent Discrimination, Harassment, and
Retaliation; (8) Declaratory Judgment; (9) Wrongful Constructive Termination; (10)
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (11) Failure to Pay Wages; (12)
Failure to Pay Overtime Compensation; (13) Failure to Provide Meal and Rest
Periods; (14) Failure to Provide Itemized Wage Statements; (15) Waiting Time
Penalties; (16) Unfair Competition; and (17) Failure to Permit Inspection of
Personnel and Payroll Records.
This action came on for a
jury trial on August 30, 2023.  The jury
returned their verdict in favor of Plaintiff in the amount of $223,327.60 on
the 1st, 4th, 5th, 7th, 9th, 10th, 12th, 13th, 14th, and 17th causes of action.  (10/12/23 Judgment.)  The Judgment states Plaintiff shall recover
her costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees from Defendant Mejia doing business as
Los Cipotes.  (10/12/23 Judgment.)
On November 2, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a memorandum of costs.  On
December 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motion.  On February 20, 2024, Los Cipotes filed an
opposition.  On February 29, 2024,
Plaintiff filed her reply.
Defendant objects to
Plaintiff’s motion on the basis the motion was filed beyond the 60 days from
the filing of the judgment in this action. 
Defendant argues the Judgment was filed on October 12, 2023, and
Plaintiff’s motion was not filed until December 12, 2023, with the sixtieth day
being December 11, 2023.  In light of the
fact that Plaintiff’s motion was untimely filed by one day, the Court in its
discretion will consider Plaintiff’s motion.
 
Discussion
A
party may not recover attorneys’ fees unless allowed by contract or
statute.  (Hom v. Petrou (2021) 67 Cal.App.5th 459, 464; C.C.P.
§1021.)  
California’s
Fair Employment and Housing Act (“FEHA”) establishes matters of “fundamental
public policy” of our state.  (Lyle v.
Warner Brothers Television Productions (2006) 38 Cal.4th 264, 277.)  To ensure that the important public policies
behind the FEHA are adequately vindicated through private enforcement actions,
FEHA directly provides for recovery of statutory attorneys’ fees and enhanced
litigation costs.  (See Gov. Code
§12965(c)(6).) 
Here,
Plaintiff is entitled to recover attorneys’ fees and costs as the prevailing
party in this case pursuant to Gov. Code §12965(c)(6) and the Judgment issued
by this Court.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
motion for attorneys’ fees is proper. 
 
Reasonable
Fees 
To
calculate a lodestar amount, the Court must first determine the reasonableness
of the hourly rates sought by Plaintiff’s counsel. The Supreme Court of
California has concluded that a reasonable hourly lodestar rate is the
prevailing rate for private attorneys “conducting non-contingent litigation of
the same type.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1133.)  “The trial court makes its determination after consideration of a
number of factors, including the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the
amount involved, the skill required in its handling, the skill employed, the
attention given, the success or failure, and other circumstances in the
case.”  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1096.) 
Plaintiff’s
Counsel declares the following hourly rates in this matter: (1) Kaveh Elihu ($1,000/hour);
(2) Sylvia Panosian ($700/hour); (3) Daniel J. Friedman ($750/hour); (4) Melad
N. Haddad ($400/hour); (5) Mark Rojas (Paralegal, $300/hour); (6) Rene
Gonzalez-Pacheco (Paralegal, $300/hour); (7) Samuel J. Moorhead ($650/hour);
(8) David C. Hopper ($550/hour); (9) Nayri Jilzian ($650/hour); (10) Jose
Valdez ($450/hour); (11) Christopher DeClue ($650/hour); and (12) paralegals/legal
assistants ($125-$175/hour).  (Decl. of Elihu
¶¶19-21, Exh. F; Decl. of Panosian ¶50; Decl. of Friedman ¶5; Decl. of Haddad
¶¶5-6; Decl. of Rojas ¶¶5-9; Decl. of Gonzalez-Pacheco ¶¶6-7; Decl. of Moorhead
¶¶3-7.)
Los
Cipotes’ opposition to Plaintiff’s request for fees as unreasonable is
unavailing and their argument not supported by case law.  Los Cipotes takes merely argues Plaintiff’s
counsel did not place their client in a better position after trial compared to
the original settlement amount. 
(Opposition, pg. 9.)  Plaintiff
prevailed on eleven of the seventeen causes of action alleged in her Complaint
despite Los Cipotes’ delay tactics before and during trial.  (See Decl. of Panosian.)
Based
on the Court’s experience, Plaintiff’s Counsel’s hourly rates are reasonable in
their community of practice, specialized area of law, and the difficulty and
complexity of the issues presented in Plaintiff’s case. 
 
Billed
Hours 
The
verified time entries of the attorneys are entitled to a presumption of
credibility, which extends to an attorney’s professional judgment as to whether
time spent was reasonably necessary to the litigation.  (Horsford v.
Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th
359, 396 [“We think the verified time statements of the attorney as officers of
the court are entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the
records are erroneous.”].)  “California courts do not require detailed
time records, and trial courts have discretion to award fees based on
declarations of counsel describing the work they have done and the court’s own
view of the number of hours reasonably spent.”  (Syers Properties III,
Inc. v. Rankin (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691, 698-699.)  
Plaintiff’s
counsel provides the following hours billed: (1) Kaveh Elihu (39.1 hours); (2)
Sylvia Panosian (234.1 hours); (3) Daniel J. Friedman (6.7 hours); (4) Melad N.
Haddad (22.1 hours); (5) Samuel J. Moorhead (77.3 hours); (6) David C. Hopper (4.8
hours); (7) Nayri Jilzian (2.1 hours); (8) Jose Valdez (2.2 hours); (9)
Christopher DeClue (0.6 hours); and (10) paralegals/legal assistants (177.7 hours).  (Decl. of Panosian ¶49, Exh. 1.)
Here,
the declaration by counsel of the time incurred on the instant case demonstrates
the reasonableness of billed hours, which totals 566.7 hours, with 389.0 hours
billed by attorneys and 177.7 hours billed by legal support staff.  (Decl. of Panosian ¶49, Exh. 1.)
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s billed hours in the total of $323,105.00 are reasonable.
  
Costs
CRC,
Rule 3.1700(b)(1) provides “Any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must
be served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum. If the cost
memorandum was served by mail, the period is extended as provided in Code of
Civil Procedure section 1013. If the cost memorandum was served electronically,
the period is extended as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section
1010.6(a)(4).”  (CRC, Rule 3.1700(b)(1).)
“After
the time has passed for a motion to strike or tax costs or for determination of
that motion, the clerk must immediately enter the costs on the judgment.”  (CRC, Rule 3.1700(b)(4).)
Plaintiff
filed a memorandum of costs on November 2, 2023.  Pursuant to CRC, Rule 3.1700(b)(4), the time
to file a motion to strike or tax costs has passed; therefore, the clerk must
enter the costs on the judgment.
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s request for $32,736.99 in costs is granted.
 
Final
Lodestar Determination 
Plaintiff
Counsel’s requests a 2.0 lodestar multiplier to their attorneys’ fees of
$323,105.00, for the total of $646,210.00. 
(Motion, pg. 16.)  Several factors
may be considered in determining whether to augment the fee award, including
but not limited to, the (1) novelty and difficulty of the questions involved
and the skill displayed in presenting them; (2) the extent to which the nature
of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys; (3) the
contingent nature of the fee award, both from the point of view of eventual
victory on the merits and the point of view of establishing eligibility for an
award; (4) the result obtained by the litigation; (5) the quality of the
representation; and (6) any delay in receipt of payment.  (Ketchum, 24 Cal.4th at pgs.
1132-1134; Press v. Lucky Stores, Inc. (1983) 34 Cal.3d 311, 321-22; City
of Oakland, 203 Cal.App.3d at pg. 83; Downey Cares v. Downey Community
Development Commission (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 983, 995 n.11.)
The
Court finds that Plaintiff’s underlying request for attorneys’ fees adequately takes
into account all the considerations for a multiplier, and therefore the Court denies
the request that a multiplier be applied to the request.  
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
motion for attorneys’ fees is granted in the amount of $323,105.00 in attorneys’
fees (without multiplier) and costs of $32,736.99. 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s motion is granted in the total amount of $355,841.99.
