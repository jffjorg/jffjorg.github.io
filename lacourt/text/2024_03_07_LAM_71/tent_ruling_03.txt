Plaintiff’s request for  sanctions in the amount of $56,153.34 against all Defendants, jointly and  severally, except as to Cohen Gardner, pursuant to C.C.P. §§1281.98(c)(1) and 1281.99(a), is granted.

(“Royal Poland”),  and Cohen Gardner LLP (“Cohen Gardner”) (collectively, “Defendants”). On May  13, 2022, this Court granted Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration. Plaintiff filed the instant  motion on January 11, 2024.  Cohen  Gardner filed an opposition on February 6, 2024.  Plaintiff filed her reply on February 14,  2024.  On February 20, 2024, Rymsza, in pro  per, filed a response to Plaintiff’s motion.  As of the date of this hearing no opposition  has been filed by Valley California, Valley Delaware, or Royal Poland.   Motion  to Vacate Arbitration Order C.C.P. §1281.97(a)(1) provides: In an employment or  consumer arbitration that requires, either expressly or through application of  state or federal law or the rules of the arbitration provider, the drafting  party to pay certain fees and costs before the arbitration can proceed, if the  fees or costs to initiate an arbitration proceeding are not paid within 30 days  after the due date the drafting party is in material breach of the arbitration  agreement, is in default of the arbitration, and waives its right to compel  arbitration under Section 1281.2.   (C.C.P. §1281.97(a)(1).) C.C.P. §1281.97(b) provides: (b) If the drafting  party materially breaches the arbitration agreement and is in default under  subdivision (a), the employee or consumer may do either of the following:   (1)     Withdraw the claim from arbitration  and proceed in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.   (2)     Compel arbitration in which the  drafting party shall pay reasonable attorney’s fees and costs related to the  arbitration.   (C.C.P. §§1281.97(b)(1)-(2).) The postponement of an arbitration as result of a party failing to  pay the arbitration fee and costs is prohibited.  (Weil & Brown et al., Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ.  Pro. Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), §9:408.47.)  If the costs are not paid within 30 days of  the due date, the drafting party is in breach of the arbitration agreement,  waives arbitration, and the consumer or employee may either withdraw the  arbitration claim and proceed in court, or compel arbitration and have the  defaulting party pay attorney fees and costs related to the arbitration.  (C.C.P. §§1280, 1281.96, 1281.97, 1281.98,  1281.99; De Leon v. Juanita’s Foods (2022) 85 Cal.App.5th 740, 745,  757-758, [concluding trial court properly vacated order compelling arbitration  for defendant who failed to pay timely and allowing arbitration to continue for  one who timely paid].)              The Arbitration Agreement in the Production Financing  Agreement at issue states the following:  This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of  California. The parties agree that any and all disputes or controversies of  any nature between them arising at any time (whether or not relating to the  Picture) shall be determined by binding arbitration in accordance with the rule  of JAMS before a single neutral arbitrator (who shall be an attorney with at  least ten (10) years experience in the motion picture industry or a retired  judge) in Los Angeles , California. All arbitration proceedings shall be  closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto shall be  permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the  arbitration award. The Federal Rules of Evidence shall be applicable to any  such proceedings.   (9/10/21 Decl. of Reynolds,  Exh. A at ¶15, emphasis added.)           Plaintiff’s counsel declares that on June 23, 2023, Plaintiff  paid a filing fee of $3,000 to JAMS.   (Decl. of Genga ¶4, Exh. B.)   Plaintiff’s counsel declares Plaintiff later made a deposit of $5,333.34  to cover her share of the arbitrator’s expected fees in the early stages of the  case, as reflected in the JAMS invoice history.   (Decl. of Genga ¶4, Exh. C.)   Plaintiff’s counsel declares Plaintiff also made a further deposit of  $20,000 toward her $38,000+ share of the expected fees of the arbitrator to  conduct a hearing on the merits, which was set for May 22-31, 2023.  (Decl. of Genga ¶5, Exh. C.)  Plaintiff’s counsel declares that sometime  before then, the parties agreed to mediate their dispute and requested and  obtained a continuance of the arbitration hearings to July 6-11, 2023.  (Decl. of Genga ¶5.)  Plaintiff’s counsel declares the parties  participated in a mediation, but no settlement resulted from it.  (Decl. of Genga ¶5.)           Plaintiff’s counsel declares Defendants’ deadline to remit  their respective $38,000+ portions of the arbitrator’s anticipated fees to  conduct arbitration came and went with no payment from any of them.  (Decl. of Genga ¶5.)  Plaintiff’s counsel declares that he, on  behalf of Plaintiff, requested that JAMS close the case if Defendants’  nonpayment persisted, and to refund Plaintiff’s partial deposit. (Decl. of  Genga ¶5.)  Plaintiff’s counsel declares JAMS  gave notice to Defendants and waited a period of time for their payment in  accordance with its procedures, but when none came it closed the case and  refunded Plaintiff her $20,000 deposit.  (Decl. of Genga ¶5.)  Plaintiff’s counsel declares Plaintiff  remains out of pocket in the amount of $8,333.34 for her filing fee and her  share of the time the arbitrator spent early in the case, which she seeks to  recover on this motion.  (Decl. of Genga  ¶5.)            Cohen Gardner states in its opposition that once this case  was submitted to JAMS, Cohen Gardner and the Rymsza Defendants paid Cohen  Gardner’s initial filing fees of $5,333.33, and the Rymsza Defendants also paid  their own fees of $5,333.33.   (Opposition, pg. 4; Decl. of Ring ¶13, Exh. C.)  Counsel for Cohen Gardner states at or about  the time of mediation, the Rymsza Defendants’ former counsel informed  Plaintiff’s counsel and Cohen Gardner’s counsel that the Rymsza Defendants did  not have the funds to pay the JAMS arbitration fees.  (Decl. of Ring ¶16.)  Cohen Gardner’s counsel declares that on May  18, 2023, the day before their payment to JAMS was due, Plaintiff’s counsel  sent an email to all counsel stating that although he was prepared to pay the  balance of his fees, he understood the Rymsza Defendants would not, that he  would proceed forward if they did, but seek a refund if they did not.  (Decl. of Ring ¶17, Exh. E.)  Cohen Gardner’s counsel declares his client  did not pay the additional $38,266.67 that had been requested by JAMS on May  19, 2023, because Cohen Gardner knew the arbitration would not be going  forward.  (Decl. of Ring ¶18.)  Cohen Gardner’s counsel declares his client was  ready and willing to proceed to arbitration and pay the fees if the other  parties were willing to proceed as well.  (Decl. of Ring ¶20.)  Cohen Gardner’s counsel declares his client  simply believed that this matter should not be tried piecemeal and that there  would be savings of time and money if both Plaintiff’s claims against the  Rymsza Defendants and against Cohen Gardner were heard together.  (Decl. of Ring ¶20.) Cohen Gardner’s opposition  states that it does not oppose this Court’s issuance of an order vacating the  stay.  (Opposition, pg. 3.)  Further, Cohen Gardner concedes it did not pay  the additional $38,266.67 that had been requested by JAMS on May 19, 2023.  (Decl. of Ring ¶18.)  Nonetheless, Cohen Gardner it was apparent by  the time Cohen Gardner’s payment was due, the other defendants were going to  default on their obligation to pay the arbitration fees.   Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s  motion to vacate this Court’s May 13, 2022, Ruling granting Defendants’ motion  to vacate the C.C.P. §1281.4 stay is granted.   Monetary Sanctions C.C.P. §§1281.98(c)(1) and  1281.99(a) provide that the Court shall impose sanctions against a party  that materially breaches an arbitration clause. Plaintiff’s counsel declares  his hourly billing rate is $600.  (Decl.  of Genga ¶6.)  Based on the Court’s  experience, Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate is reasonable in his community of  practice.  Plaintiff’s counsel declares  he incurred 79.7 hours opposing Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration, the  motion to stay Plaintiff’s discovery pending the motion to compel arbitration,  and the arbitration proceedings that were ultimately abandoned, or a total of  $47,820.00.  (Decl.  of Genga ¶¶5-6.)  Plaintiff’s counsel  declares Plaintiff incurred $8,333.34 in costs related to the abandoned arbitration:  the JAMS filing fee ($3,000), and the deposit to cover the arbitrator’s  expected fees in the early stages of arbitration ($5,333.34).  (Decl. of Genga ¶4, Exh. C.) The Court grants Plaintiff’s  request for reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred on the instant motion  for a total of $56,153.34 against all Defendants, except Cohen Gardner, pursuant  to C.C.P. §§1281.98(c)(1) and 1281.99(a).   C.C.P. §128.5 Sanctions In light of this Court’s  award of sanctions C.C.P. §§1281.98(c)(1) and 1281.99(a), the Court declines to  award C.C.P. §128.5 sanctions against Defendants.   Conclusion Plaintiff’s motion to vacate  the C.C.P. §1281.4 stay that has been placed on this action since May 13, 2022,  is granted. Plaintiff’s request for  sanctions in the amount of $56,153.34 against all Defendants pursuant to C.C.P.  §§1281.98(c)(1) and 1281.99(a), is granted except as to Cohen Gardner. Plaintiff’s request for  C.C.P. §128.5 sanctions is denied.
