And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the opposition to the Motion to Tax Costs, which was filed one day late. Despite the untimely filing, the court will exercise its discretion to consider the opposition. The court notes that the plaintiff has submitted a substantive reply brief and has not cited any prejudice to the late filing. The court will also apply the Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b), which requires opposition papers to be served and filed with the court at least 9 court days before the hearing. The court will consider the burden of proof on the party seeking to tax costs, as stated in Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn.
