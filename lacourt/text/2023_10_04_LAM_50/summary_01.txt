And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiffs' motion to continue the trial date from September 18, 2023, to a later date. The plaintiffs' counsel, Juan Victoria, Jeffrey Lamb, and Matthew McNicholas, are unavailable due to other trials scheduled in Los Angeles County. The parties had previously stipulated to a trial continuance on August 31, 2023. The judge finds that the plaintiffs have demonstrated good cause for a trial continuance and grants the motion. The final status conference is continued to a later date, and all discovery deadlines are also continued.
