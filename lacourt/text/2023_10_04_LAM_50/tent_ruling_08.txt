TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:
 
APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION OF PAUL MORDARSKI TO THE BAR OF THIS COURT
  PRO HAC VICE



 
Defendants Michael J. Forde III, ERC Consulting Experts, LLC, In Media
LLC, and Positive Insights Consulting, LLC (collectively, “Defendants”) request
that the Court grant the application of Paul Mordarski to appear as their
counsel pro hac vice in the instant action. 
The Court notes a few defects with the
application. First, pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 9.40,
subdivisions (a)(2)-(3), no person is eligible to appear as counsel pro hac
vice if the person is “[r]egularly employed in the State of California” or “[r]egularly engaged in substantial business, professional, or
other activities in the State of California.” Although Mr. Mordarski
states that he is not “regularly engaged in
the practice of law in California” (Mordarski Decl., ¶ 1), he does not
demonstrate that each of the circumstances set forth in California Rules of
Court, rule 9.40, subdivisions (a)(2)-(3) do not apply to him.   
Second, pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 9.40,
subdivision (d)(2), the application must state “[t]he courts to which the
applicant has been admitted to practice and the dates of admission.”
Mr. Mordarski states that he was admitted to
practice before the courts of the state of Connecticut (Mordarski
Decl., ¶ 2.), but does not list the date(s) of admission to such courts. 
Third, pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 9.40,
subdivision (d)(3), the application must state “[t]hat
the applicant is a licensee in good standing in those courts.” Mr. Mordarski
does not state that he is a licensee
in good standing in the courts identified in paragraph 2 of his declaration. 
Based on the foregoing, the instant
application is denied without prejudice.  
Defendants are ordered to provide notice of
this ruling.
