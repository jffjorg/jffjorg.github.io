And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Hon. Rolf M. Treu, has issued a tentative ruling on Munro's motion for leave to file a Cross-Complaint against various parties. The motion is opposed by the plaintiffs, who claim that they have not been provided with sufficient information about the proposed Cross-Complaint. The judge notes that Munro has attached a proposed Cross-Complaint to his reply in support of the motion, but this has not been provided to the plaintiffs. The judge decides to continue the hearing on the motion to November 3, 2023, and orders Munro to provide notice of this ruling. The plaintiffs are allowed to file a supplemental opposition by October 25, 2023, and a courtesy copy is to be delivered to the court.
