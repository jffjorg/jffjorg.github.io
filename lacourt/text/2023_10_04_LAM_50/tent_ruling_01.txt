TENTATIVE RULING
  RE: 
 
PLAINTIFFS’
  MOTION TO CONTINUE THE SEPTEMBER 18, 2023 TRIAL AND RELATED DATES
 




 
Background
Plaintiff Freddy M. (“Freddy M.”), by
and through his guardian ad litem, Paola Mejia, Noe Reyes Lopez, and Paola
Mejia (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action on November 16, 2018
against Defendants Joe Oroñoz and Sarah Oroñoz. On February 13, 2019,
Plaintiffs filed an amendment to the Complaint naming PI Properties No. 79, LLC (“PI Properties”) in
place of “Doe 21.” 
Plaintiffs filed the operative Third
Amended Complaint (“TAC”) on June 26, 2020. The TAC alleges causes of action
for (1) breach of implied warranty of habitability, (2) tortious breach of
implied warranty of habitability, (3) negligence, (4) private nuisance, and (5)
violation of Business
and Professions Code section 17200. This action concerns alleged uninhabitable
conditions at 6429 ½ S. Victoria Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90043 (the “Subject
Property”), where Plaintiffs reside. (TAC, ¶¶ 1, 16.) Plaintiffs allege, inter
alia, that deteriorated lead-based paint and other lead hazards at the
Subject Property resulted in Freddy M. contracting
lead poisoning and suffering permanent neurological, cognitive, and behavioral
harm. (TAC, 
¶
70.)
On June 29, 2020, PI
Properties filed a Cross-Complaint against a number of cross-defendants,
asserting causes of action for (1) declaratory relief, (2) implied equitable
indemnity, and (3) negligence.     
The
trial date in this action is currently set for October 4, 2023.     
Plaintiffs
now move for an order to “continue the trial, presently set for September
18, 2023, and related dates, including the Final Status Conference, to February
12, 2024, or to a date thereafter
convenient to the Court’s calendar and all trial counsels’ calendars.”[1] No
opposition to the motion was filed. 
            Discussion
“The court may grant a
continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the
continuance.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subd.
(c).) “In ruling on a motion or application for continuance, the court must
consider all the facts and circumstances that are relevant to the determination.”
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subd. (d).) 
Plaintiffs assert that
good cause exists here to continue the trial date. 
Plaintiffs note that circumstances that may indicate good cause
for a trial continuance include “[t]he unavailability of trial counsel because
of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances.” (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subd.
(c)(3).) Plaintiffs’ counsel states that “[l]ead trial counsel, Juan Victoria, and counsel Jeffrey Lamb are set
for trial in Los Angeles County for a case that must be
tried due to the 5-year rule which is currently set for September 12, 2023.”
(Victoria Decl., ¶ 6.) In
addition, “Juan C. Victoria, Plaintiffs’
lead trial counsel, has trials set in Los Angeles County on…October
11, 2023, October 16, 2023, October 23, 2023, October 25, 2023, November
1, 2023, November 9, 2023, November 13, 2023.” (Victoria Decl., ¶ 8.) “Jeffrey
Lamb, also counsel for Plaintiffs in this action, has trials set in Los Angeles
County on…October 2, 2023, October 11, 2023, October 16, 2023, October 23,
2023, and November 1, 2023.” (Victoria Decl., ¶ 9.) In addition, “Plaintiffs’ counsel Matthew
McNicholas is also set to begin trial on September 29, 2023, October 2, 2023,
October 9, 2023, October 16, 2023, October 18, 2023, and October 30, 2023.”
(Victoria Decl., ¶ 7.) 
            Plaintiffs
also assert that the circumstances support a trial continuance here under
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332,
subdivision (d). (See Mot. at pp. 6:19-7:10.)
Pursuant to 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subdivision (d)(9), factors to be considered in ruling on a motion for a trial
continuance include “[w]hether all parties have stipulated to a
continuance.” Plaintiffs’ counsel indicates
that on August 31, 2023 the Parties
stipulated to a trial continuance. (Victoria Decl., ¶ 2.) 
            Based
on the foregoing, and in light of the lack of any opposition, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated good cause for a trial continuance.
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs’
motion is granted.
The Court continues the
final status conference to ______________, at 10:00 a.m., in Dept. 50 and trial
to _____________, at 9:30 a.m., in Dept. 50.
All discovery deadlines
are continued based on the new trial date. 
Plaintiffs are ordered
to give notice of this ruling.
