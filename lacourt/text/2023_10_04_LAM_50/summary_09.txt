Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants to the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Michelle Parrella, alleges that the defendants, Special X, Inc. d/b/a Undivided, et al., violated Labor Code section 1102.5(c) by retaliating against her for refusing to participate in an activity that would have resulted in a violation of state or federal statute. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's claim is uncertain, ambiguous, and unintelligible because she fails to identify the specific protected activity she was retaliated against for refusing to engage in. The court has sustained the defendants' demurrer to the second cause of action with leave to amend. The court orders the plaintiff to file and serve an amended complaint, if any, within 20 days of the date of this order. If no amended complaint is filed within 20 days, the defendants are ordered to file and serve their answer within 30 days of the date of this order.
