## English Summary

The judge has tentatively ruled to dismiss Plaintiff Michelle Parrella's second cause of action against Defendants (Special X, Inc., Special X LLC, Jason Lehmbeck, Seth Besse, and Stephen John Zimmerman) for retaliation under California Labor Code section 1102.5(c). 

The Judge found that Plaintiff's complaint is unclear about what specific activity she was allegedly retaliated against for refusing to participate in. While Plaintiff served on jury duty and alleges Defendants pressured her to avoid it, she doesn't claim she was prohibited from serving.  

Furthermore, the Judge questions whether individual defendants can be held liable under this section of the Labor Code, noting a lack of clear California precedent. 

The Plaintiff has 20 days to amend the complaint to address these issues. If not, the Defendants will have 30 days to file an answer.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Michelle Parrella vs. Special X, Inc. and others. The plaintiff, Michelle Parrella, was hired as the Director of Navigator Operations and later received a jury duty summons. She served on a jury from August 11, 2021, to September 3, 2021. After returning to work, she was terminated by the defendants. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants retaliated against her for serving on a jury, which is a violation of Labor Code section 1102.5(c). The defendants demurred to the second cause of action, arguing that the plaintiff failed to allege a specific protected activity and that individual defendants cannot be held liable under Labor Code section 1102.5. The court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, ordering the plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 20 days. If no amended complaint is filed, the defendants must file an answer within 30 days.
