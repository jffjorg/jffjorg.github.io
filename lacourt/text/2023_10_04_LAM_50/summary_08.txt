And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the application of Paul Mordarski to appear as counsel pro hac vice in the case. The application was defective in several respects: it did not demonstrate that Paul Mordarski was not regularly employed or engaged in substantial business in California, it did not list the dates of admission to practice in the state of Connecticut, and it did not state that Paul Mordarski was a licensee in good standing in the Connecticut courts. The judge has denied the application without prejudice, meaning that the defendants can refile the application if they correct the defects. The judge has also ordered the defendants to provide notice of the ruling.
