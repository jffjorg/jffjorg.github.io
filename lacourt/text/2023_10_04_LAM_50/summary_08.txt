## English Summary

The Judge has reviewed the application from the Defendants to allow Paul Mordarski to represent them in court temporarily (pro hac vice). The application was incomplete and did not fully address the requirements outlined in California court rules. Specifically, it did not sufficiently demonstrate that Mr. Mordarski doesn't regularly work or conduct significant business activities in California, and it lacked information about his admission date and current standing in the Connecticut courts.  

As a result, the Judge denied the application without prejudice, meaning the Defendants can re-submit it with the necessary information.
