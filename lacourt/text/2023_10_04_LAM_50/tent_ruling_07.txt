[1]The Court also
notes that in the notice of non-receipt of opposition, Susan Lee requests that
the Court consider a reply brief Susan Lee filed in support of a separate
motion. Susan Lee states that she “requests
that this reply be considered in connection with the instant motion as it
contains further evidence of vexatious conduct.” (Notice of Non-Receipt of
Opposition at p. 2:11-13.) Susan Lee does not cite any legal authority to support
such request, and the Court notes that “¿[t]he general
rule of motion practice…is that new evidence is not permitted with reply
papers.¿” (¿Jay v.
Mahaffey (2013) 218
Cal.App.4th 1522, 1537¿.)
Thus, the Court declines to consider the prior reply brief as requested by
Susan Lee.
