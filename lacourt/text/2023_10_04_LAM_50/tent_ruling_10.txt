TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:
 
MOTION TO TAX COSTS 




AND RELATED
  CROSS-ACTION


 



 
Background
On February 16, 2017, Plaintiffs Wild Chang
(“Chang”) and Kenneth Lo (“Lo”) filed the lead action against Defendants
Farmers Insurance Company, Inc. (“Farmers”), Fire Insurance Exchange (“FIE”),
Stacy Chern Insurance Agency (“Chern Insurance”), and Stacy Chern (“Chern”). On
January 28, 2021, Chang, Lo, and Wild Chang, Jr. (“Chang, Jr.”) (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) filed the second action against Farmers, FIE, Chern, and Woolls
Peer Dollinger & Scher. The two cases were subsequently consolidated, and
the operative Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”) was deemed filed on July 22, 2021
in the consolidated cases. 
In
the TAC, Plaintiffs assert causes of action for (1) fraud, (2) tortious breach
of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (3) breach of contract, (4)
unfair business practices, (5) professional negligence, and (6) emotional
distress, arising out of an insurance coverage dispute. 
Following rulings on defendants’ amended special motion to
strike and demurrer to the TAC, the remaining causes of action are tortious
breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach of contract,
and unfair business practices against FIE only; and professional negligence
against Chern only. 
            On November
30, 2022, a Judgment of Dismissal was entered in this action. The Judgment of
Dismissal provides, inter alia, that “WHEREAS Defendants Fire Insurance
Exchange and Stacy Chern’s (‘Defendants’) motion for terminating sanctions was
heard on November 14, 2022 at 9:30 a.m., and the Court granted Defendants’
motion, striking the operative Third Amended Complaint, 1. NOW, THEREFORE, IT
IS ORDERED ADJUDED AND DECREED that this matter is hereby dismissed in its
entirety, and judgment is hereby entered in favor [sic] Defendants Fire
Insurance Exchange and Stacy Chern and against plaintiffs Wild Chang and
Kenneth Lo on all causes of action.”  On December 20, 2022, FIE filed a Memorandum
of Costs, seeking $16,882.00 in costs.
Plaintiffs now move to tax costs. FIE and
Chern (jointly, “Defendants”) oppose.[1] 
Discussion
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision
(b), “[e]xcept as otherwise expressly provided by
statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs
in any action or proceeding.” Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1032, subdivision (a)(4), “‘[p]revailing party’ includes the party
with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is
entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief,
and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against
that defendant.” As set forth above, on November 30, 2022, the Court entered a
Judgment of Dismissal providing, inter alia, that “this matter is hereby dismissed in its entirety, and
judgment is hereby entered in favor [sic] Defendants Fire Insurance Exchange
and Stacy Chern and against plaintiffs Wild Chang and Kenneth Lo on all causes
of action.” 
Costs
recoverable under section 1032 are restricted to
those that are both reasonable in amount and reasonably necessary to the
conduct of the litigation. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1033.5,
subds. (c)(2), (3).) Costs
“merely convenient or beneficial” to the preparation of a case are disallowed.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(2); see Ladas v.
California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774 [expenses for
attorney meals incurred while attending local depositions not “reasonably
necessary”].) 
“A
‘verified memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence of [the] propriety’ of
the items listed on it, and the burden is on the party challenging these costs
to demonstrate that they were not reasonable or necessary.” (Adams v. Ford
Motor Co. (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 1475, 1486-1487 [italics and brackets
omitted].) “If
the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is
on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or
necessary. On the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are
put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs.” (Ladas v.
California State Auto. Assn., supra,
19 Cal.App.4th at p. 774.) Costs otherwise allowable as a matter of right
may be disallowed if the court determines they were not reasonably necessary,
and the court has power to reduce the amount of any cost item to an amount that
is reasonable. (See Perko’s Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS Enterprises (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 245 [finding
that “the intent and effect of section 1033.5, subdivision (c)(2) is to
authorize a trial court to disallow recovery of costs, including filing fees,
when it determines the costs were incurred unnecessarily”].)
A.   
Item 1 – Filing and Motion Fees
FIE seeks
a total of $3,143.00 in filing and motion fees. FIE’s Memorandum of Cost
(Worksheet) indicates that the filing and motion fees include, inter alia,
a $500.00 filing fee for a “12/14/2018 Motion for summary judgment.” Plaintiffs
assert that “Defendants’
filing fee for Motion for Summary Judgment must be denied according to the law,
because the hearing has never been held.” (Mot. at p. 3:25-26.) The Court notes
that Plaintiffs do not cite any legal authority to support this assertion. In
the opposition, Defendants indicate that they incurred a $500.00 non-refundable reservation fee
for an anticipated motion for summary judgment. (Zapf Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. B.) Defendants
assert that “[r]eserving a date for a dispositive motion was a legitimate
effort to defend themselves in this action initiated by Plaintiffs. Although
Plaintiffs delays and discovery recalcitrance rendered the anticipated motion
impractical, that does not render the initial reservation – required by the
court’s rules – superfluous.” (Opp’n at p. 2:25-28.) The Court agrees that the
December 14, 2018 filing fee is reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(2)), and declines
to tax it. 
FIE also seeks a $480.00 filing fee for “6/2/2020 Motions to Compel Plaintiff to Answer
Discovery and Awarding Monetary Sanctions (8 motions x $60.00).” Plaintiffs
object to this fee, asserting that “[f]iling fees already included in the
sanctions per court order date October 28, 2020 must be denied according to the
law.” (Mot. at p. 4:2-3.) In addition, FIE seeks a $480.00 filing fee for “1/27/2021 Motions to compel further discovery
responses (8 motions x $60.00).” Plaintiffs object to this fee, asserting that
“[f]iling
fees already included in the sanctions per court order dated February 25, 2021,
February 26, March 1 and March 4, 2021, must be denied according to the law.” (Mot. at p. 4:8-9.) FIE also seeks a $60.00 filing fee for a “5/4/2022 Notice of Motion and Motion to Compel Oral Depositions of Plaintiffs Wild Chang and Ken Lo.” Plaintiffs object to this fee,
asserting that “[f]iling
fees already included in the sanctions per court order dated October 14, 2022
must be denied according to the law.” (Mot. at p. 4:27-28.) 
In the
opposition, Defendants
state that “Plaintiffs argue that these filing fees
were already included in the Court’s sanction orders dated October
28, 2020, February 25, 2021, and May 4, 2022. Defendants agree and not
dispute that Item 1 of the Memorandum of Costs should be reduced by $1,020.”
(Opp’n at p. 3:8-10.) Accordingly, the Court reduces the requested costs by
$1,020.00.   
FIE also
seeks a total of $120.00 in filing fees for “8/17/2022 Defendants’ Motion to
Dismiss Pursuant to CCP §583.310 & RJN,” and
“8/22/2022 Ex Parte Application for an Order to Advance Hearing Date on
Defendants Motion to Dismiss.” Plaintiffs assert that these fees should be
stricken because Defendants’ motion to dismiss was denied[2],
and because “Defendants
themselves requested the continuance from 06-15-22 to 09-21-22 to accommodate
their calendar conflict.” (Mot. at p. 4:19-20.) Defendants counter that “[t]he statute does not dictate that the prevailing party to a lawsuit
may only recover costs for motions on which they
prevailed. Rather, filing fees for motions reasonably made are recoverable. The fees were incurred. [Zapf Dec., ¿ 4; Ex. C].” (Opp’n at p.
3:18-20.) Indeed, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(1), “[f]iling, motion,
and jury fees” are allowable as costs. As discussed, “[a]llowable costs shall be
reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely
convenient or beneficial to its preparation.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.
(c)(2).) The Court finds that the foregoing fees are
reasonably necessary, and the Court declines to tax them.  
In the instant motion, Plaintiffs also
reference a number of filing fees claimed by FIE for notices of rulings, notices
of minute orders/Court orders, a stipulation and proposed order, and a proposed
judgment, totaling $600.00. (See Mot. at p. 5:5-7:14.) Plaintiffs assert
that these fees should be “denied” because “[t]here are no court fees for
filing notice and stipulation.” (Mot. at p. 5:5.) Defendants counter that items allowable as costs include “[f]ees
for the electronic filing or service of documents through an electronic filing
service provider if a court requires or orders electronic filing or service of
documents.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(14).) Defendants
assert that “[a]s Plaintiffs represented themselves in pro per,
Defendants were tasked with filing most of the Notices of Ruling and Notices of Orders in this litigation over
five years. The filings were reasonably necessary for the conduct of this litigation. Defendants
incurred costs to prepare and file these Notices, including attorneys’ fees for
the drafting of all thirty Notices and $20 in attorney service fees. The $20
fee incurred per Notice is reasonable….” (Opp’n at p. 5:25-6:2.) The Court
agrees that the foregoing fees are reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation, and declines to tax them.  
B.    
Item 8 – Witness Fees 
FIE seeks
a total of $7,500.00 in witness fees. In the motion, Plaintiffs assert that “[t]he matter was
never tried, and none of the expert invoices is attached. As a general matter,
expert witness fees, invoiced or not, are not recoverable.” (Mot. at p.
7:15-17.) Plaintiffs cite to Ripley v. Pappadopoulos (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th
1616, 1624, where the
Court of Appeal noted that “Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033.5, subdivision (b)(1), provides that the fees of experts not
ordered by the court are not allowable as costs unless expressly authorized by
law.” 
In the
opposition, Defendants cite to First Nationwide Bank v. Mt. Cascade (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 871, 875-876,
where the Court of Appeal noted that “[u]nder section
1033.5, subdivision (b)(1), of the Code of Civil Procedure parties may
not recover expert witness fees as costs ‘except when expressly authorized
by law.’ Such express authorization exists in instances when the expert is
court appointed (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.
(a)(8)) or when the judgment awarded is lower than a rejected settlement
offer (Code Civ. Proc, § 998, subds.
(c) & (d)).” (Emphasis added.) Defendants’ counsel states in
her supporting declaration that “[o]n May
10, 2019, I caused for Fire, Chern Insurance and Chern to issue an offer to compromise to Plaintiff Chang, pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 998, for $14,242.56 and a separate offer to compromise
to Plaintiff Lo, pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 998, for $14,242.56. Plaintiffs had 30 days to accept said offers. Said
offers were not accepted and
expired on or about June 9, 2019. True and correct copies of both these Offers
are attached hereto as
Exhibit A. Both offers to Compromise expired without Plaintiffs accepting them.” (Zapf Decl., ¶ 2.) 
Defendants
further indicate that they “hired Lola Hogan as an expert witness in
this litigation, who prepared for and expected to testify at trial. Defendants incurred $7,570.00 in
expert fees after the expiration of Defendants’ Offers to Compromise.” (Zapf
Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. E.) Defendants assert that accordingly, “Judgment in this
lawsuit has been entered in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiff Chang and
Plaintiff Lo on all causes of action. Defendants are the prevailing parties.
The expert fees are recoverable pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 998.” (Opp’n at p. 6:17-20.) 
In light
of the foregoing, the Court declines to tax the claimed $7,500.00 in witness
fees. 
C.    
Item 11 – Court Reporter Fees as Established by Statute
FIE seeks a total
of $2,525.00 in court reporter fees. As to Item
11, Plaintiffs assert that “[a]ll of Defendants’ request of $2,525 for court
reporter fees are not established by statute and must be denied. Defendants
provide no documentation supporting these cost items.” (Mot. at p. 7:20-23.)[3] Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(11), items allowable as costs under Section
1032 include “Court reporter fees as established by statute.” 
In the
opposition, Defendants cite to Government Code
section 68086, subdivision (d)(2), which provides that “if an official
court reporter is not available, a party may arrange for, at the party’s
expense, the presence of a certified shorthand reporter to serve as an official
pro tempore reporter. At the arranging party’s request, the court shall appoint
the certified shorthand reporter to be present in the courtroom and serve as
the official reporter pro tempore unless there is good cause shown for the
court to refuse that appointment. The fees and charges of the certified
shorthand reporter shall be recoverable as taxable costs by the prevailing
party as otherwise provided by law.” Defendants thus assert that
they are entitled to recover their court
reporter fees by statute. Plaintiffs do not appear to dispute this point in the
reply. Defendants provide copies of their Court Reporter invoices, which total
$2,525.00 in fees. (Zapf Decl., ¶ 7, Ex. F.) 
Based on
the foregoing, the Court declines to tax the claimed $2,525.00 in Court
reporter fees.  
D.   
Item 12 – Models,
Enlargements, and Photocopies of Exhibits
FIE seeks
a total of $1,571.00 in costs for “[m]odels, enlargements, and photocopies of
exhibits.” Plaintiffs assert that no documentation was provided to support
these requested costs and note that the matter did not go to trial. 
In the
opposition, Defendants assert that photocopies for trial exhibits are expressly
allowed. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision
(a)(13), items
allowable as costs include “[m]odels, the enlargements of exhibits and photocopies of
exhibits, and the electronic presentation of exhibits, including costs of
rental equipment and electronic formatting, may be allowed if they were
reasonably helpful to aid the trier of fact.” 
Defendants’
counsel provides copies of “the invoice(s) showing the costs incurred printing
trial exhibits/binders.” (Zapf Decl., ¶ 8, Ex. G.) Defendants assert that they
“incurred $1,496.45 for the printing [sic] trial binders and exhibits,” and
that the “calculation of $1,571 on the first page of the Memorandum of Costs
was erroneously calculated from these two invoices.” (Opp’n at p. 7:10-11; p.
7, fn. 1.) The Court notes that the only item that appears to be highlighted on
Defendant’s Exhibit G is a fee for $558.75 next to “Description: Please print
exhibit 500-526 with tabs.” (Zapf Decl., ¶ 8, Ex. G.) Thus, Defendants do not
appear to have substantiated the requested amount of $1,496.45 for the printing
of trial binders and exhibits.  
Based on
the foregoing, the Court finds that it is appropriate to award $558.75 in costs
for Item 12 (Models, enlargements, and photocopies of exhibits). Thus, the
Court deducts $1,012.25 from the total amount requested ($1,571.00 - $1,012.25
= $558.75.) 
E.    
Item 14 – Fees for
Electronic Filing or Service
FIE seeks
a total of $2,143.00 in “[f]ees for electronic filing or service.” Plaintiffs
assert that FIE does not provide documentation to support these requested fees.

Plaintiffs
note that FIE seeks $35.00 in courtesy copy costs for “8/17/2022 Defendants’
Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to CCP §583.310 &
RJN,” and “8/22/2022 Ex Parte Application for an Order to Advance Hearing Date
on Defendants Motion to Dismiss.” Plaintiffs assert that these claimed costs
should be denied because Defendants’ motion to dismiss was denied. Plaintiffs
also assert that “Defendants
themselves requested the continuance from 06-15-22 to 09-21-22 to accommodate
their calendar conflict.” (Mot. at p. 8:26-27.) The Court notes that this
argument is addressed above.  
Lastly,
Plaintiffs note that FIE seeks $65.00 in courtesy copy costs for “11/4/2022
Notice of Motion and Motion for Terminating Sanctions.” Plaintiffs argue in the
motion that “[t]his
fee must be denied…because Defendants…duplicate the same, identical
‘court filing fee’ in the judgement resulting from the order of November 14,
2022, under a created, but non-existent, item of the alleged ‘electronic filing
or service fee’.” (Mot. at p. 9:8-11, emphasis omitted.) The Court finds that
this argument is unclear. As to the disputed courtesy copy fees, Defendants
note that they “seek the costs incurred to comply with
Department 50’s rules,” and assert that the charges were thus “reasonable and
necessary.” (Opp’n at p. 11:1-2.) Defendants cite to Sanford v. Rasnick (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1121, 1132, where the Court of Appeal noted that
“[n]either subdivision (a) nor (b) of section
1033.5 states whether attorney service charges for court filings and
deliveries or mediators’ fees are allowable or not. Thus, these costs fall
within the ‘discretionary category,’ subdivision (c)—that is, they are
allowable if in the court’s discretion they were ‘reasonably necessary to the
conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation.’
(§ 1033.5, subd. (c)(2).).” 
The Sanford Court noted
that “[w]e ourselves have affirmed such awards, including in Ladas,
supra, 19 Cal.App.4th at page 776, where we
upheld a trial court’s allowance of attorney service messenger and delivery
charges, and in Gibson v. Bobroff (1996)
49 Cal.App.4th 1202, 1207–1209 [57 Cal. Rptr. 2d 235], where we upheld a
trial court’s exercise of discretion to award mediation expenses as costs
under section 1033.5, subdivision (c). (See
also Foothill-De Anza Community College Dist.
v. Emerich (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 11, 30 [69 Cal. Rptr. 3d 678] [same
day messenger fees to file supplemental brief and peremptory challenge to
assigned trial judge].).” (Sanford v. Rasnick, supra,
246 Cal.App.4th at p. 1133.) Defendant’s counsel states in her declaration that
“true
and correct copies of the invoice(s) showing the $2,142.65 incurred in providing
courtesy copies to Department 50 are attached hereto as Exhibit D.” (Zapf
Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. D.) 
The Court finds that the challenged
courtesy copy costs were reasonably necessary to
the conduct of the litigation and declines to tax them. 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the Court denies
Plaintiff’s motion to tax in part, and grants the motion in part. The Court reduces
the total requested costs of $16,882.00 by $2,032.25, which equals $14,849.75. 
Defendants are ordered to provide notice of
this ruling.
