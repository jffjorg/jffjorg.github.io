LEGAL STANDARD – COMPEL RESPONSES, INTERROGATORIES
Within 30 days after service of interrogatories, the party to whom the
interrogatories are propounded shall serve the original of the response to them
on the propounding party, unless on motion of the propounding party the court
has shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the responding
party the court has extended the time for response. (CCP § 2030.260(a).)
If
a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling
response to the interrogatories. (CCP § 2030.290(b).)
“The
party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise the
option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to
the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection for
work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on
motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both
of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently
served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210,
2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely
response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP §
2030.290(a).)
Unlike
a motion to compel further responses, a motion to compel responses is not
subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding party does not have to
demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a “meet and confer”
requirement. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404 citing Weil and
Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group
2006) ¶¶8:1137 to 8:1144, pp. 8F-59 to 8F-60, ¶¶ 8:1483 to 8:1489, pp. 8H-29 to
hH-30 (Weil & Brown).)
ANALYSIS
On
June 11, 2024, Plaintiff served Form Interrogatories, Set One, on Defendant, Vache
Agazaryan. (Alkana Decl. ¶ 3.) Plaintiff’s counsel states that on July 22,
2024, a letter was sent to Defendant’s counsel requesting responses to the
discovery request. (Alkana Decl. ¶ 5.)
Plaintiff’s
counsel, Eugene S. Alkana, stated that as of the date of filing this motion,
Defendant has failed to provide any responses. (Alkana Decl. ¶ 4.) [The Court
notes that the Alkana declaration was signed on September 5, 2024; however, the
motion was not filed until September 10, 2024.] 
Here,
because Defendant has not provided timely responses, Plaintiff’s motion should
be granted.
TENTATIVE
RULING MOTION 1
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel verified responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set
One, propounded to Defendant, Vache Agazaryan, is GRANTED. 
Defendant,

Sanctions
Plaintiff requests an award of monetary sanctions in the amount of
$1,060.00 against Defendant and his counsel, Harry A. Safarian, for attorney’s
fees and costs incurred in bringing this motion.
CCP
§ 2030.290 states in relevant part:
The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.
 
(CCP § 2030.290(c).)
 
“The
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
Plaintiff’s
counsel, Eugene S. Alkana, requests sanctions based on the following: (1) An
hourly rate of $500/hour, (2) One hour preparing this motion, (3) One hour
reviewing and replying to any opposition and attending the hearing, and (4)
$60.00 for the filing fee.
