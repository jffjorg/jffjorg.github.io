Here is a summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has reviewed the motion to quash the deposition subpoena for production of business records filed by Garnik and Argam. The motion is opposed by Gagik, who argues that the records sought are relevant to the case. The judge is confused by the parties' arguments and is unsure which party has the burden on this type of motion.

The judge notes that the subpoena seeks a wide range of records, including policy records, claim records, and investigative reports. The judge is concerned that the subpoena is overly broad and may seek privileged information.

The judge will hear argument on the motion and will consider the parties' arguments on the following issues:

* Whether the deposition subpoena for production of business records is a subpoena duces tecum or a deposition subpoena for the production of business records.
* Whether an affidavit of good cause was required.
* Whether the records sought are protected by attorney-client privilege, attorney work product, and the privilege associated with investigation in anticipation of litigation and the right to privacy.

The judge will also consider the parties' arguments on the Insurance Information and Privacy Protection Act and whether it prohibits the disclosure of the records sought.

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to quash the deposition subpoena for production of business records will be heard and considered.
