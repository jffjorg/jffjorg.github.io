MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT 
Hearing Date: 10/9/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 21STCV37594 ANNA VASERFIRER, et
al. vs UBER TECHNOLOGIES, INC. et al.
Moving Party: Defendant Avis Rent A Car
System, LLC
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT IS GRANTED 
 
Background
 
On May 22, 2023, Plaintiffs Anna Vaserfirer and
Ardady Vaserfirer filed a Second Amended Complaint (SAC) alleging that
Defendant Oscar Moquete, while working for Defendant Uber and driving a car
rented from Defendant Avis, crashed into Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs allege motor
vehicle negligence, general negligence, negligent hiring, supervision, and
retention, and negligent entrustment against Avis. Avis now moves the Court for
summary judgment as Plaintiffs claims are barred by the Graves Amendment and
there is no evidence of independent negligence from Avis. Plaintiffs filed a
notice indicating that they do not contest the present MSJ.
 
Legal Standard¿ 
¿¿ 
The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or summary
adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’
pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in
fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal. 4th 826, 843.) “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal. App. 4th 1110, 1119.)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is always on
the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no triable issues
of material fact.” (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal. App.
4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant moving for summary judgment or summary
adjudication “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has
no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of
action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the
cause of action.” CCP § 437c(p)(2). “Once the defendant . . . has met that
burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a triable issue
of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense
thereto.” CCP § 437c(p)(2). "When the motion for summary judgment is
supported by affidavits sufficient to sustain the motion,…the burden of showing
that triable issues exist shifts to the party opposing the motion. [Citation.]
A party cannot avoid summary judgment based on mere speculation and
conjecture…but instead must produce admissible evidence raising a triable issue
of fact. (Crouse v. Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 1509, 1524.) “If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary judgment
should be granted.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center
(2008) 159 Cal. App. 4th 463, 467.)

Discussion
Under the Graves
Amendment, an owner of a motor vehicle that rents or leases the vehicle shall
not be liable under the law of any state, by reason of being the owner of the
vehicle, for harm to persons or property that results or arises out of the use,
operation, or possession of the vehicle during the period of the rental or
lease, if: (1) the owner is engaged in the trade or business of renting or
leasing motor vehicles; and (2) there is no negligence or criminal wrongdoing
on the part of the owner. (49 U.S.C. § 30106, subd. (a).) The Graves Amendment
“shields owners of leased vehicles ‘engaged in the business or trade of renting
or leasing motor vehicles’ from vicarious liability for the alleged negligence
of their lessee’s drivers.” (Vargas v. FMI, Inc. (2015) 233 Cal.App.4th
638, 642.) 
The Graves Amendment
applies here, as Avis is engaged in the trade or business of renting or leasing
motor vehicles. Regarding whether Avis is independently negligent for the
incident, in California, a rental car agency is not liable for negligent entrustment
if the agency fully complies with the requirements of Vehicle Code sections
14604 and 14608, and the customer does not appear impaired or otherwise unfit
to drive at the time of rental. (Flores v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co.
(2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 1055, 1068.)
VEH § 14604 states that 
(a) No owner of a motor
vehicle may knowingly allow another person to drive the vehicle upon a highway
unless the owner determines that the person possesses a valid driver's license
that authorizes the person to operate the vehicle. For the purposes of this
section, an owner is required only to make a reasonable effort or inquiry to
determine whether the prospective driver possesses a valid driver's license
before allowing him or her to operate the owner's vehicle. An owner is not
required to inquire of the department whether the prospective driver possesses
a valid driver's license. 
(b) A rental company is
deemed to be in compliance with subdivision (a) if the company rents the
vehicle in accordance with Sections 14608 and 14609. 
VEH § 14608 states that 
(a) A¿person
shall¿not¿rent
a motor vehicle to another¿person¿unless¿both
of the following requirements have been met: 
(1)¿The
person to whom the vehicle is rented is licensed under this code or is a
nonresident who is licensed under the laws of the state or country of his or
her residence. 
(2)¿The
person renting to another person has inspected the driver's license of the
person to whom the vehicle is to be rented and compared¿either¿the
signature thereon with¿that¿of
the¿person¿to
whom the vehicle is to be rented or the photograph thereon with the person to
whom the vehicle is to be rented. 
Defendant has met its
initial burden in negating Plaintiff’s claim for negligent entrustment, as
Plaintiff had a valid license, and Defendant compared the signature and photo
on the license with the individual at the time of the rental. Regarding negligent
hiring, supervision, and retention, Avis shown that Defendant Moquete was not
an employee, agent, independent contractor, or joint venture partner of Avis.
Additionally, Avis does not share profits with Defendant Moquete or the Uber
Defendants. As to general negligence, Plaintiffs’ discovery responses to
Defendant’s special interrogatories, which requested all facts, witnesses, and
documents supporting Plaintiffs’ contention of Defendant’s negligence, are
factually devoid. Plaintiff produced no facts or evidence showing how Defendant
was independently negligent in causing the incident. Defendant has successfully
shifted its burden as to all causes of action in the complaint. Plaintiff did
not file an opposition and, thus, failed to raise a triable issue of fact.
Thus, the present motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.
