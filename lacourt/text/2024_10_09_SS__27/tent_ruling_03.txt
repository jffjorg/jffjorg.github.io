CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV21888 DANIEL ORTIZ VS.
RENO KESHISHIAN ET AL.
Moving Party: Plaintiff
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: 
MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS IS GRANTED
 
Background
On October 2, 2023, Plaintiff Daniel Ortiz
served Form Interrogatories, Set One, on Defendants HERBAL SOLUTIONS and SS
CAL-PACIFIC, INC. On October 12, 2023, Plaintiff served Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Production, Set One, on Defendants.
Responses were due on November 3, 2023, and November 14, 2023, respectively.
After receiving no responses, Plaintiff attempted to reach out to Defendants
numerous times in November 2023, February 2024, and April 2024, but received no
replies. On August 12 and 13, 2024, the Court ruled on Plaintiff’s motions to
compel and ordered Defendants to provide the discovery responses at issue and
to pay monetary sanctions by September 5, 2024. Defendants did not file an
opposition or appear at the hearings for the motions to compel. Defendants did
not comply with the court’s order and failed to provide the discovery responses
or pay monetary sanctions. Furthermore, on July 18, 2024, Plaintiff and
Defendants Reno Keshishian and Legacy Global Private Security attended a
mediation that resulted in successful settlement. However, Defendants SS-CAL
Pacific, Inc. and Herbal did not participate in the mediation or respond to
Plaintiff’s request for a mediation.
 
Plaintiff now moves the Court for terminating
sanctions in that Defendants have abandoned their case. Defendants did not file
an opposition.
 
Legal Standard 
¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030 gives the
court the discretion to impose sanctions against anyone engaging in a misuse of
the discovery process. Misuse of the discovery process includes failure to
respond to an authorized method of discovery or disobeying a court order to
provide discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d), (g).) A court may impose
terminating sanctions by striking pleadings of the party engaged in misuse of
discovery or entering default judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(d).) A violation of a discovery order is sufficient for the imposition of
terminating sanctions. Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th
1611, 1620. Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in
disobeying the court’s orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d
771, 795-796.) 
 
The court should consider the totality of the
circumstances, including conduct of the party to determine if the actions were
willful, the detriment to the propounding party, and the number of formal and
informal attempts to obtain discovery. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77
Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) If a lesser sanction fails to curb abuse, a greater
sanction is warranted. (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th
1495, 1516.) However, “the unsuccessful imposition of a lesser sanction is not
an absolute prerequisite to the utilization of the ultimate sanction.” (Deyo,
supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 787.) Before any sanctions may be imposed the court
must make an express finding that there has been a willful failure of the party
to serve the required answers. (Fairfield v. Superior Court for Los Angeles
County (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.) Lack of diligence may be deemed
willful where the party understood its obligation, had the ability to comply,
and failed to comply. (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 787; Fred Howland
Co. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 605,
610-611.) The party who failed to comply with discovery obligations has the
burden of showing that the failure was not willful. (Deyo, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 788; Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66
Cal.App.3d 250; Evid. Code, §§ 500, 605.) 
 
A terminating sanction is a “drastic measure
which should be employed with caution.” (Deyo, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.)
“A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But
where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence
shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery
rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Mileikowsky
v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.) While the court
has discretion to impose terminating sanctions, these sanctions “should be
appropriate to the dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Deyo,
84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) “[A] court is empowered to apply the ultimate
sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with
his discovery obligations.” (Ibid.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff served Defendants the discovery requests at issue to
Defendants in October 2023. When the responses were overdue, Plaintiff’s
counsel has made numerous attempts to meet and confer but received no responses.
When Plaintiff’s motions to compel initial responses were heard, Defendants did
not file an opposition nor did they appear. After the Court granted the motion
and ordered Defendants to pay sanctions and serve initial responses, Defendants
failed to comply with the Court’s order. Defendants also did not respond to
Plaintiff’s request for a mediation or attend the mediation with the other
Defendants. Defendants did not file an opposition to the present motion. Based
on the foregoing facts, the Court finds that Defendants have abandoned their
case. Thus, the present motion is granted, and Defendants' answers are
stricken.
