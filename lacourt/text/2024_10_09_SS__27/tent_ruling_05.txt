HAYWOOD vs CEDAR SINAI
Moving Party: Defendant CEDAR SINAI
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL IS GRANTED
 
On June 14, 2023,
Plaintiff, in pro per, filed the present case. On August 19, 2024, proof of
service of the summons and complaint was filed. On September 4, 2024, Defendant
Cedar Sinai filed a demurrer, which was granted with leave to amend on October
3, 2024. The trial date is currently set for December 11, 2024. Defendant moves
the court to continue trial and discovery for nine months. As the case is still
in the early pleading stages and the parties have not had time to conduct
discovery, Defendant’s motion to continue the trial and all trial-related dates
by nine months is reasonable. Furthermore, this is the parties’ first
continuance, filed several months ahead of the trial date. Plaintiff did not an
opposition alleging prejudice. In consideration of the foregoing factors, the
motion is granted.
The new Trial Date is
set for August __, 2025,
at 8:30 a.m. The Final Status Conference is continued to August __, 2025, at 10:00
a.m.  All case-related deadlines will
