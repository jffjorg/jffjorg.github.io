And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Avis Rent A Car System, LLC's motion for summary judgment. The case, 21STCV37594, involves a lawsuit brought by Plaintiffs Anna Vaserfirer and Ardady Vaserfirer against Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc. et al., alleging motor vehicle negligence, general negligence, negligent hiring, supervision, and retention, and negligent entrustment.

The Judge found that Defendant Avis is shielded from liability under the Graves Amendment, which applies to owners of leased vehicles engaged in the business of renting or leasing motor vehicles. Additionally, the Judge determined that Avis complied with the requirements of Vehicle Code sections 14604 and 14608, and that the customer, Defendant Moquete, presented a valid driver's license and appeared fit to drive at the time of rental.

The Judge also found that Plaintiffs failed to provide evidence of independent negligence by Avis, and therefore, granted summary judgment in favor of Defendant Avis. The ruling is tentative, and the parties must submit by email or appear at the hearing on October 9, 2024, to argue the ruling.
