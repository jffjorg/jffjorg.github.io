And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to bifurcate the case without prejudice. This means that the defendant can still raise the issue of bifurcation at the trial, but the judge is not bound by this decision. The judge has ordered that the briefing on bifurcation be included in the trial binders along with any motions in limine filed in the case. The judge has also recognized that the defendant may direct the trial court to this order, which should not be construed to bind the trial court in making a bifurcation decision.
