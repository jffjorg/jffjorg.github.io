And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court grants Plaintiff Daniel Ortiz's motion to terminate sanctions against Defendants Reno Keshishian, SS CAL-PACIFIC, INC, and Herbal Solutions. The Court finds that Defendants have abandoned their case by failing to respond to discovery requests, failing to comply with the Court's order, and not participating in a mediation. The Court orders that Defendants' answers are stricken. The Court notes that terminating sanctions is a drastic measure that should be employed with caution, but in this case, the Court finds that it is justified due to the Defendants' willful failure to comply with discovery obligations. The Court also notes that the unsuccessful imposition of a lesser sanction is not an absolute prerequisite to the utilization of the ultimate sanction.
