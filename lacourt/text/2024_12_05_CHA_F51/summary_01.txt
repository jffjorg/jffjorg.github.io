And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motions for protective orders, preventing the plaintiff from taking the depositions of five individuals who may have knowledge relevant to the case. The judge finds that the depositions are not necessary, as West Coast Arborists, Inc. has already admitted vicarious liability for the actions of its employee, Jose Armando Priego, and the plaintiff does not seek punitive damages against the defendants. The judge also finds that the depositions would cause undue burden on the deponents and their counsel. The judge declines to impose sanctions on either party.
