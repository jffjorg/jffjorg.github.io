  Case Number:  23STCV06188    Hearing Date:   May 2, 2024    Dept:  52 Tentative Ruling:
Nicole D. Lewis’s Motion
to Be Relieved as Counsel for Defendant 
Nicole D. Lewis of ND
Lewis Law moves to be relieved as counsel for defendant Fresco FICO LLC.  The motion meets all but one requirement under
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  “The
notice of motion and motion, the declaration, and the proposed order must be
served on the client and on all other parties who have appeared in the case.”  (Rule 3.1362(d).)  Lewis did not file proof of service of the
moving papers on plaintiff Alan Richards. 

The court will therefore
continue the hearing to permit Lewis to file proof of service of the moving
papers and notice of the continued hearing date on plaintiff Richards.  Lewis must also file proof of service of
notice of the continued hearing on defendant Fresco FICO LLC.
The court hereby continues
the hearing on Nicole D. Lewis’s motion to be relieved as counsel to May 21,
2024, at 9:00 a.m.
