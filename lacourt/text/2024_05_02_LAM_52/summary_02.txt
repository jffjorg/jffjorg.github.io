And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by 6380 Quebec LLC to file a first amended complaint and record another notice of pending action. The motion is granted, and the plaintiff is ordered to file the first amended complaint forthwith. The motion to record another notice of pending action is denied, as the plaintiff has failed to provide sufficient evidence to show the probable validity of a real property claim. The court has previously expunged the lis pendens due to the plaintiff's failure to meet its burden of proof.
