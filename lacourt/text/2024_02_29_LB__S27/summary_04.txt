And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is in response to Hector Rodriguez's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages and related allegations against him in the lawsuit filed by Ivan Amir against Hector, Edna Rodriguez, and Jamie Russom. The lawsuit stems from an automobile accident involving three vehicles, including Plaintiff's, Hector's, and Russom's. The complaint contains a prayer for punitive damages against Hector and Edna based on the allegation that Hector was intoxicated at the time of the accident and that Edna furnished alcohol to Hector, who was under the age of 21. The judge notes that the complaint fails to allege the level of Hector's intoxication and does not allege any additional aggravating factors. Therefore, the motion to strike is granted. The judge also notes that Plaintiff failed to file a timely opposition to the motion and that the lack of opposition suggests that Plaintiff concedes the merits of the motion.
