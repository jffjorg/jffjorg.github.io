And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering two motions: one to enforce a settlement agreement and one to consolidate cases. In the settlement agreement, the defendant agreed to pay the plaintiff $305,000 and, upon completion of all payments, the plaintiff would quitclaim title to the property to the defendant. However, the defendant has made all payments, but the plaintiff has not quitclaimed title to the property. The defendant is seeking an order enforcing the settlement, citing CCP ยง664.6, which allows the court to reduce the parties' settlement to a legal judgment when one party is in breach of the settlement agreement. However, the judge notes that the defendant has failed to cite any authority permitting the court to sign a quitclaim deed on behalf of the plaintiff.

Regarding the motion to consolidate, the defendant filed the motion on December 14, 2023, and the judge granted an ex parte application to advance the hearing on February 21, 2024. However, the judge denied the motion because it violates CRC 3.350(a), which requires a notice of motion to consolidate to include certain information and be filed in each case sought to be consolidated. The defendant also failed to provide proof of service showing that notice was given to the plaintiff. The judge orders the defendant to give notice.

The judge notes that parties who intend to submit on the tentative ruling must send an email to the court and identify the party submitting on the tentative. If no party submits on the tentative, the motion may be placed off calendar.
