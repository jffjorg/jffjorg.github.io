And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages in the case between Carolina Arce and Pro Employer Staffing, LLC and Creative Essences, Inc. The defendants argued that the plaintiff had not pled sufficient facts to support punitive damages, but the judge found that the allegations that the defendants terminated Arce's employment because of her pregnancy could lead a reasonable juror to conclude that the defendants acted with malice and/or oppression. The judge also found that the plaintiff's allegations that the defendants were joint employers and that the defendants acted through their officers, directors, or managing agents were sufficient at the pleading stage. The judge has ordered the defendants to file an answer to the complaint within 10 days.
