  Case Number:  22LBCV00940    Hearing Date:   February 29, 2024    Dept:  S27 Robert M. Dickson, attorney for Cora
Woodard, seeks to be relieved as counsel, contending a total breakdown of the
attorney-client relationship has occurred by Woodard has failed to return a
substitution of attorney.    
 
CRC 3.1362(e) requires an attorney
moving to be relieved as counsel to lodge a proposed order with the moving papers.  3.1362(d) requires the proposed order to be
served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case.  
 
The Court cannot locate a proposed
order on the motion or a proof of service of a proposed order, and therefore
the motion is denied without prejudice.    
 
Additionally, the proof of service
indicates the motion to be relieved as counsel was served on the client and all
parties to the action, but does not indicate the declaration in support of the
motion was served.  3.1362(d) also
requires service of the declaration in support of the order.  The motion is denied without prejudice on
this ground as well.  
 
Counsel is ordered to give notice.  
 
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative as
directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department
does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the tentative
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed off calendar.  If a party submits on the tentative, the
party’s email must include the case number and must identify the party
submitting on the tentative. If any party does not submit on the tentative, the
party should make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing on this
matter.
