The Court's tentative ruling is that Robert M. Dickson's motion to be relieved as counsel for Cora Woodard is denied without prejudice. The reason for this decision is that the proposed order and declaration in support of the motion were not served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case, in violation of California Rules of Court 3.1362(d). Additionally, the Court cannot locate a proposed order on the motion, in violation of 3.1362(e). The parties are ordered to give notice and those who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court. If a party does not submit on the tentative, they should make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing.
