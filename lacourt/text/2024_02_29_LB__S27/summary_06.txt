And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Regent Villa Retirement Home, Inc. (Defendant) against Ghalib Abdelrahim and Lina Abdelrahim (Plaintiffs) in the case of 23LBCV01288. The Plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging elder abuse, negligence, and wrongful death against the Defendant, who operates a licensed assisted living facility.

The Defendant demurred to the elder abuse cause of action, arguing that the Plaintiffs failed to plead specific facts to support their claim. The Plaintiffs argued that their claim was pled with sufficient particularity, but the court found that the complaint lacked specific facts to support the claim.

The court sustained the demurrer and ordered the Plaintiffs to file an amended complaint within 20 days. The Plaintiffs must omit the elder abuse cause of action from the amended complaint if they cannot plead specific facts to support it. The Defendant must file a responsive pleading within the statutory time thereafter.

The court also granted leave to amend if and only if the Plaintiffs can plead specific facts articulating a claim for elder abuse. The court reserved ruling on the ratification issue for such time when the Plaintiffs have met the threshold burden to plead elder abuse in the first instance.
