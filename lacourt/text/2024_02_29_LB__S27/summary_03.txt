Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff's motions to compel further responses to requests for production of documents (RPDs) and requests for production of interrogatories (RFOs). The defendant, Food 4 Less of Southern California, Inc. and The Kroger Co., has refused to produce incident reports and identifying information for employees who were working at the store on the date of the incident.

The judge found that the defendant failed to provide any evidence to support its contention that the incident reports are privileged. The judge also found that the defendant's argument that the reports are not relevant is misplaced, as the reports are directly relevant to the litigation.

The judge ordered the defendant to produce the incident reports and identifying information within ten days. The judge also ordered the defendant to serve further responses to the RFPs and RFOs without objection.

The judge did not impose sanctions on the defendant, as the plaintiff did not seek sanctions in its motion. The judge noted that the parties have agreed to enter into a protective order with respect to the contact information, which will eliminate any private concerns.

The judge's ruling is subject to change after the parties have an opportunity to submit their arguments and evidence at the scheduled hearing on February 29, 2024.
