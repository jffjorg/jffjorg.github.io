And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the petition for writ of mandamus filed by Wanda Solomon, the petitioner. The petitioner disputes the amount of benefits she received under the CalFresh program and seeks a writ of mandamus to review the administrative decision. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) had previously denied the petitioner's claims, finding that she was not entitled to additional benefits. The petitioner's petition did not provide any reasoned argument explaining why the ALJ's decision was erroneous. Additionally, the petitioner did not provide any supporting evidence or citation to the administrative record. Therefore, the judge finds that the petitioner has not demonstrated any entitlement to mandamus relief. The judge also denies the petitioner's motion to vacate the case and assigns a new judge.
