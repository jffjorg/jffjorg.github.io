And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The defendant raised a new argument in its reply papers, claiming to be a "third-party beneficiary" under the arbitration provision. However, the judge finds that this argument was waived because it was not raised in the moving papers. The judge also notes that the case of Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) does not support the defendant's claim, as it was not decided based on a third-party beneficiary finding. Additionally, the judge finds that the defendant failed to present admissible evidence demonstrating the existence of a valid agreement, and therefore has not carried its burden to compel arbitration.

## English Summary

The judge is leaning towards denying the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration. 

The Defendant tried to argue that they are a third-party beneficiary to an arbitration agreement, but the judge finds this argument was not properly raised in the initial court filings and is therefore waived.

Furthermore, the judge feels the Defendant has not provided enough evidence to prove that a valid agreement to arbitrate exists.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel arbitration. The Defendant, BMW NA, had argued that it is a third-party beneficiary and can compel arbitration based on a case called Felisilda v. FCA US LLC. However, the Judge notes that the Felisilda case did not actually decide the issue of third-party beneficiary status, and that the Defendant had waived this argument by not raising it in the initial moving papers. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff's opposition to the motion is well-taken, citing other cases such as Ford Motor Warranty Cases and Ngo v. BMW of North America, LLC. Additionally, the Judge finds that the Defendant has failed to present admissible evidence demonstrating the existence of a valid agreement, which is a necessary requirement for compelling arbitration. Overall, the Judge appears to be leaning towards denying the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration.
