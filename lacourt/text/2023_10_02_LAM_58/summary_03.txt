And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The defendant raised a new argument in its reply papers, claiming to be a "third-party beneficiary" under the arbitration provision. However, the judge finds that this argument was waived because it was not raised in the moving papers. The judge also notes that the case of Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) does not support the defendant's claim, as it was not decided based on a third-party beneficiary finding. Additionally, the judge finds that the defendant failed to present admissible evidence demonstrating the existence of a valid agreement, and therefore has not carried its burden to compel arbitration.
