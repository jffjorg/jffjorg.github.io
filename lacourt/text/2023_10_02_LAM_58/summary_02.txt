Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration, finding that there is no binding enforceable agreement to arbitrate between the parties. The judge ruled that the doctrine of equitable estoppel does not apply because the plaintiff's claims arise out of the defendant's express and implied warranties, and not the sales contract between the plaintiff and the dealership. The judge also found that the delegation clause in the sales contract is not enforceable as to a non-signatory party.

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration in the case of Cortez v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc. The plaintiff, Veronica Marie Cortez, had purchased a 2022 Honda Accord Hybrid vehicle from Honda of Downtown Los Angeles, but the vehicle suffered from defects and nonconformity to warranty. The defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., refused to make necessary repairs, and the plaintiff sought restitution under the Song-Beverly Act.

The defendant argued that the parties had agreed to arbitrate the dispute based on the Retail Installment Sales Contract – Simple Finance Charge, which contained an arbitration provision. However, the Judge ruled that the doctrine of equitable estoppel was not applicable in this case, as the plaintiff had only sued the manufacturer, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., and not the dealership that sold the vehicle.

The Judge also found that the arbitration agreement was not binding on the non-signatory defendant, as there was no evidence of a valid agreement to arbitrate between the parties. The Judge further ruled that the court must decide whether the parties agreed to arbitrate, and not the arbitrator. Therefore, the defendant's motion to compel arbitration was denied.
