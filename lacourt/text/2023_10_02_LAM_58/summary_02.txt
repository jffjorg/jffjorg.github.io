Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration, finding that there is no binding enforceable agreement to arbitrate between the parties. The judge ruled that the doctrine of equitable estoppel does not apply because the plaintiff's claims arise out of the defendant's express and implied warranties, and not the sales contract between the plaintiff and the dealership. The judge also found that the delegation clause in the sales contract is not enforceable as to a non-signatory party.
