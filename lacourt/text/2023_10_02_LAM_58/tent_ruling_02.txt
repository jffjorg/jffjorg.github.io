Honda Motor Co.
Case
No.:                    23STCV10025
Matter:                        Motion to Compel
Arbitration 
Moving Party:             Defendant American Honda Motor
Co., Inc. 

Responding
Party:      Plaintiff Veronica Marie
Cortez

Tentative
Ruling:      The Motion to Compel
Arbitration denied. 

 
This is a Song-Beverly action. The Complaint alleges that
on March 28, 2022, Plaintiff Veronica Marie Cortez purchased a 2022 Honda
Accord Hybrid (Vehicle). Thereafter, the Vehicle suffered from “nonconformity
to warranty to, including, but not limited to, brake system, electrical,
vehicle stops on its own, low speed brake control problem, steering, and other
defects.” The Complaint further alleges Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc.,
(Defendant or Defendant Honda) refused or failed to make necessary repairs. The
Complaint seeks restitution under Song-Beverly pursuant to express and implied
warranties.
 
            On
July 7, 2023, Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. filed a
motion to compel arbitration pursuant to Plaintiff’s Retail Installment
Sales Contract – Simple Finance Charge (Sales Contract). Plaintiff opposes
the motion. 
 
            The
motion to compel arbitration is denied. 
 
            Evidentiary Issues
 
            Plaintiff’s objections
to Defendant’s evidence are ruled as follows: Nos. 1-2 are sustained. 
 
Legal
Standard 
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1281.2, a court may order arbitration of a controversy if it finds that
the parties have agreed to arbitrate that dispute. Because the obligation to
arbitrate arises from contract, the court may compel arbitration only if the
dispute in question is one in which the parties have agreed to arbitrate. (Weeks
v. Crow (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 350, 352.) Since arbitration is a favored
method of dispute resolution, arbitration agreements should be liberally
interpreted, and arbitration should be ordered unless the agreement clearly
does not apply to the dispute in question. (Id. at p. 353; Segal v.
Silberstein (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 627, 633.)
 
Analysis
 
Existence of a Valid Agreement
 
In ruling on
a petition to compel arbitration, a court must determine two threshold matters:
first, whether a valid agreement to arbitrate exists; and second, whether that
agreement encompasses the dispute at issue. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.2.)   
 
By way of background, on March 28,
2022, Plaintiff entered into a Sales Contract with non-party, dealer Honda of
Downtown Los Angeles. (Dao Decl., Ex. A.) In moving for arbitration, Defendant
Honda – not to be confused with Honda of Downtown Los Angeles – requests a
court order compelling
Plaintiff to arbitrate its claims pursuant to this Sales Contract.
 
            Acknowledging
that it is a non-party to the Sales Contract and its related arbitration
provision, Defendant Honda argues compelling Plaintiff’s claims to arbitration
is still proper based on the doctrine of equitable estoppel. Plaintiff relies
heavily on the holding in Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th
486 for.[1]  
 
            The
doctrine of equitable estoppel is an exception to “ ‘the general rule that a
nonsignatory to an agreement cannot be compelled to arbitrate and cannot invoke
an agreement to arbitrate, without being a party to the arbitration agreement.’
[Citations.] [¶] ... Under that doctrine, as applied in ‘both federal and
California decisional authority, a nonsignatory defendant may invoke an
arbitration clause to compel a signatory plaintiff to arbitrate its claims when
the causes of action against the nonsignatory are “intimately founded in and
intertwined” with the underlying contract obligations.’ [Citations.] ‘By
relying on contract terms in a claim against a nonsignatory defendant, even if
not exclusively, a plaintiff may be equitably estopped from repudiating the
arbitration clause contained in that agreement.’ [Citations.] ‘The rule applies
to prevent parties from trifling with their contractual obligations.’ ” (JSM
Tuscany, LLC v. Superior Court (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 1222, 1236-1237.)
 
            In
Felisilda, the plaintiff filed a complaint against a dealership and a
manufacturer alleging a violation of the Song-Beverly Act based on the
manufacturer's express warranties. (Felisilda, supra, 53 Cal.App.5th at
p. 491.) The plaintiff and the dealership had entered into a sales contract
with an arbitration provision.[2]
(Id. at p. 490.) The dealership moved to compel arbitration of the
entire matter, including claims as to the nonsignatory manufacturer. (Id.
at p. 491.) In affirming the trial court's decision to order the entire case to
arbitration based on the doctrine of equitable estoppel, the Court of Appeal
explained “the sales contract was the source of the warranties at the heart of
this case.” (Id. at p. 496.) 
 
            Felisilda
is an outlier; several California appellate courts have since declined to
follow it. (See e.g., Ford Motor Warranty Cases
(2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324 [Second District]; Kielar v. Superior Court
of Placer County (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 614 [Third District]; Montemayor
v. Ford Motor Co. (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 958 [Second District].)
 
            Rather,
the more persuasive legal authority arises from the cases cited by Plaintiff, Ford
Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324[3]
and Montemayor v. Ford Motor Co. (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 958. These
authorities explained Felisilda’s statement that “the sales contract was
the source of the warranties” was flawed because “manufacturer vehicle
warranties that accompany the sale of motor vehicles without regard to the
terms of the sale contract between the purchaser and the dealer are independent
of the sale contract.” (Ford Motor Warranty Cases, supra, 92 Cal.App.5th
at p. 1334; accord Montemayor, supra, 92 Cal.App.5th at p. 969; see also
Ngo v. BMW of North America, LLC (9th Cir. 2022) 23 F.4th 942, 949 [“the
express and implied warranties arise ‘independently of a contract of sale’ ”].)

 
            Here,
Plaintiff has only sued the manufacturer, Defendant Honda. The Complaint
alleges: “Defendant AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR CO., INC.
offered an “express warranty” to plaintiff pursuant to the Act.” (Compl., ¶ 8.)
Further, “[t]he sale of the aforementioned subject vehicle was also accompanied
by defendant AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR CO., INC.’s implied warranty of fitness.” (Compl.,
¶ 9.) There is no breach of contract cause of action in the Complaint and no
mention of the Sales Contract. 
 
Moreover,
as in Kielar
v. Superior Court of Placer County (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 614, the Sale
Contract contains a “Warranties Seller Disclaims” provision, which states: “If you do not get a written
warranty, and the Seller does not enter into a service contract within 90 days
from the date of this contract, the Seller makes no warranties, express or
implied, on the vehicle, and there will be no implied warranties of merchantability
or of fitness for a particular purpose. This provision does not affect any
warranties covering the vehicle that the manufacturer may provide.” (Dao
Decl., Ex. A, p. 5 [emphasis added].) (Kielar, supra, 94 Ca.App.5th
at p. 620 [warranty “was not part of the sales contract with the dealership”].)

 
            Somewhat
disingenuously, Defendant argues that Plaintiff is asking this Court to rely “solely
on non-binding federal authority and argues the Court should ignore binding
California Court of Appeal precedent and follow these federal court orders and
opinions.” (Reply 1:27-2:1.) Defendant then goes on only to address Plaintiff’s
citation to Ngo v. BMW of North America, LLC
(9th Cir.2022) 23 F.4th 942 – ignoring the plethora of other California authorities
cited above. 
 
Under
these circumstances Felisilda is not controlling on this Court: “[w]hen
there is a division in Court of Appeal opinions, a trial court chooses which
line of authority to follow.” (The Urban Wildlands Group, Inc. v. City of
Los Angeles (2017) 10 Cal.App.5th 993, 1002.) The Court follows the more
recent line of cases rejecting Felisilda. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff's
claims arise out of Defendant Honda’s express and implied warranties, and not
the Sales Contract between Plaintiff and the dealership. Thus, equitable
estoppel does not apply to allow Defendant, as a non-signatory, to enforce the
arbitration provision in the Sales Contract. 
 
            Lastly,
Defendant also argues the threshold question of arbitrability should be decided
by the arbitrator – not the court – based on the Sale Contract’s delegation
clause. 
 
The arbitration
provision here specifically provides: “Any claim or dispute, whether in
contract, tort, statute or otherwise (including the interpretation and scope of
this Arbitration Provision, and the arbitrability of the claim or dispute)…, shall,
at your or our election, be resolved by neutral, binding arbitration and not by
a court action.” (Dao Decl., Ex A, p. 7.)
 
There are two prerequisites for a
delegation clause to be effective. First, the language of the clause must be
clear and unmistakable. [Citation.] Second, the delegation must not be
revocable under state contract defenses such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability.”
(Tiri v.
Lucky Chances, Inc. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 231, 242; see Rent-A-Center,
West, Inc. v. Jackson (2010) 561 U.S. 63, 68, 69, fn. 1.) The “clear and
unmistakable” test reflects a “heightened standard of proof” that reverses the
typical presumption in favor of the arbitration of disputes. (Ajamian v.
CantorCO2e, L.P. (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 771, 787.)
 
Here, however, Defendant’s
delegation argument fails for the same reason as the equitable estoppel
argument: there is no binding enforceable agreement to arbitrate between Defendant
and Plaintiff. That is, Defendant cannot invoke the right to the benefits of
the Sales Contract because it was not a party to the agreement; thus, the
threshold issue of whether Defendant, as a nonsignatory, may compel Plaintiff
to submit to arbitration under the Sales Contract must be decided by this
Court. (Benaroya v. Willis (2018) 23 Cal.App.5th 462, 469 [“ ‘The
question of whether a nonsignatory is a party to an arbitration agreement is
one for the trial court in the first instance.’ ”].)
 
Moreover, several cases have found
that a similar/identical delegation provision is not enforceable as to a non-signatory.
(See e.g., In re ZF-TRW Airbag Control Units Products Liability Litigation (C.D. Cal.,
Sept. 27, 2021, No. LAML1902905JAKFFMX) 2021 WL 5069003, at *3; Kramer v.
Toyota Motor Corp. (9th Cir. 2013) 705 F.3d 1122, 1127; Vincent v. BMW
of North America, LLC (C.D. Cal., Nov. 26, 2019, No. CV 19-6439 AS) 2019 WL
8013093, at *4.) 
            
             Based on the foregoing,
Defendant Honda has not carried its burden of demonstrating the existence of a
valid, binding arbitration agreement between
Plaintiff and Defendant Honda.[4]  
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration is denied.
