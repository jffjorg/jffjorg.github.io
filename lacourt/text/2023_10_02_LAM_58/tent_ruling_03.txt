[1]           In
Reply, Defendant also raised a third-party beneficiary theory in this case. The
moving papers contains a Table of Contents entry stating “AHM May Compel Arbitration As A
Third-Party Beneficiary,” but the body of the Memorandum of Points and Authorities
contains no such argument. In opposition, Plaintiff argues that Defendant
cannot rely on the third-party beneficiary
doctrine to
prevail on this motion. (Opp. 9:6-11:5.) Defendant argued that it is a
“third-party beneficiary” in its reply memorandum.
(Reply 3:2-4:15.) Defendant asserted: “Felisilda
v. FCA US LLC, 53 Cal.App.5th 486,
(2020), the only binding authority at issue, supports BMW NA’s [sic] motion
to compel arbitration as a third-party beneficiary.” (Reply 6:13-14.) However, Felisilda
was not decided based on a third party beneficiary finding. Moreover, this newly raised third-party beneficiary argument has been waived as a
result of Defendant’s failing to raise it in the moving papers. In any event,
Plaintiff’s opposition argument on this issue is well-taken. (See Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, 1336-1340 [relying on the
analysis in Ngo v. BMW of North America, LLC (9th Cir. 2022) 23 F.4th
942, 947-948].)


[2]           The arbitration
provision in Felisilda is an identical arbitration provision to the one
at issue in this proceeding and is also identical to the provision at issue in Kielar
v. Superior Court of Placer County (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 614, 620 which
declined to follow the ruling in Felisilda.
 


[3]           Defendant
refers to this case as Ocha in reply.


[4]           As an
additional grounds for denial, Defendant has failed to carry its burden by
failing to present admissible evidence demonstrating the existence of a valid
agreement. (See Court’s Evidentiary Rulings)
