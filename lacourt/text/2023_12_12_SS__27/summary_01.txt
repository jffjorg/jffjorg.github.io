And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

This is a tentative ruling regarding the petition to approve a minor's compromise in the case of Osman Argueta (Claimant) against MNE Investments, LLC (Defendant). The Claimant, a minor, has agreed to settle his claims against the Defendant in exchange for $975,000.00. The proposed settlement will be used to pay medical expenses, attorney's fees, and non-medical expenses, with a balance left for the Claimant. The Court has reviewed the proposed settlement and finds it to be fair and reasonable. The Court grants the petition to approve the minor's compromise and sets an order to show cause (OSC) for proof of deposit. Petitioner and Claimant must appear at the hearing, unless the Court finds good cause to excuse their appearance.
