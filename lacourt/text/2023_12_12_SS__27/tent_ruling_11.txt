INTRODUCTION
On September 11, 2020, Plaintiff Holly
McKay (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant Samuel Nicholas
Wechsler (“Defendant”) arising from a September 15, 2018, motor vehicle and
electric scooter accident. Trial is currently set for February 2, 2024. 
On November 14, 2023, Plaintiff moved
to exclude Defendant’s expert testimony and evidence at trial. 
Defendant opposes and Plaintiff replies.
LEGAL PRINCIPLES
Failure
to provide an expert witness declaration or failure to adequately disclose the
expert's expected testimony may result in the exclusion of expert opinion. (Ochoa
v. Dorado (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 120, 139.) Section 2034.300 “empowers the
court to exclude the expert opinion of any witness offered by a party who has
unreasonably failed to produce expert reports and writings as required by
section 2034.270. (§ 2034.300, subd. (c).) ... [A] party who fails to [comply]
before the specified date does so at its own risk.” (Boston v. Penny Lane
Centers, Inc. (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 936, 952.) 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 2034.300 provides in pertinent part: “[O]n objection of
any party who has made a complete and timely compliance with Section 2034.260,
the trial court shall exclude from evidence the expert opinion of any witness
that is offered by any party who has unreasonably failed to do any of the
following: (a) List that witness as an expert under Section 2034.260. [¶] (b)
Submit an expert witness declaration. [¶] (c) Produce reports and writings of
expert witnesses .... [¶] (d) Make that expert available for a deposition....” 
Failure
to comply with expert designation rules may be found to be “unreasonable” when
a party's conduct gives the appearance of gamesmanship. (Staub v. Kiley (2014)
226 Cal.App.4th 1437, 1447, citing Stanchfield v. Hamer Toyota, Inc.
(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1504.) The operative inquiry is whether the conduct
being evaluated will compromise these evident purposes of the discovery
statutes: “to assist the parties and the trier of fact in ascertaining the
truth; to encourage settlement by educating the parties as to the strengths of
their claims and defenses; to expedite and facilitate preparation and trial; to
prevent delay; and to safeguard against surprise.” (Id. at p. 1504.) 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff asserts that Defendant’s
experts were not disclosed on time and Defendants did not produce expert
reports, writing, or any documents demanded by Plaintiff. Plaintiff asserts
that she has complied with her expert disclosure requirements. In support,
Plaintiff advances the declaration of her counsel. (Decl. Burtchaell, ¶ 4,5,6.)

In opposition, Defendant argues that he
did not act unreasonably in designating expert witnesses one day late. Defendant
also argues that Defendant’s counsel provided independent medical examination
reports to Plaintiff’s counsel as soon as they received them from Dr.
Nagelberg, Dr. Delis, and Dr. Amos and Defendant’s counsel provided numerous
dates for depositions of all defense experts. Defendant advances the
declaration of his counsel, but does not submit evidence to support that he
provided independent medical examination reports to Plaintiff’s counsel. (Decl.
Dondanville, ¶ 4.) 
In reply, Plaintiff argues that Defendant
has acted unreasonably because he has moved to continue trial multiple times and
reopen discovery due to his own lack of preparation. Plaintiff also argues that
Defendant’s counsel proposed unreasonable and impractical dates for depositions.
Plaintiff advances the declaration of her counsel. (Decl. Burtchaell, ¶ 2, Ex.
7.) 
The Court will hear from counsel.  The Court is reluctant to exclude experts
based on a one-day delay in designation, particularly in light of the
aforementioned purposes of discovery: “to
assist the parties and the trier of fact in ascertaining the truth; to
encourage settlement by educating the parties as to the strengths of their
claims and defenses; to expedite and facilitate preparation and trial; to
prevent delay; and to safeguard against surprise.” At the same time, it is concerned with
Defendant’s alleged repeated obstructionist conduct. 
CONCLUSION
The Court will hear further argument.
