The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Plaintiff's Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment Pursuant to CCP ยง 664.6. The Plaintiff, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, brought a subrogation action against the Defendant, Annette Espino Gonzalez, after she caused an automobile collision with the Plaintiff's insured person. The parties settled and dismissed the case, with the Defendant agreeing to make payments of $300 per month until the settlement amount of $7,000.00 was paid in full. The Defendant defaulted on these payments, and the Plaintiff filed the current motion to vacate the dismissal and enter judgment. The Judge granted the motion, finding that the parties had agreed to retain jurisdiction over the case and that the Plaintiff was entitled to judgment for the settlement amount minus credit for payments received.
