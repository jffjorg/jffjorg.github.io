And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted all four motions to compel pretrial interrogatories filed by the defendants against the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs, Judith Rogoff, Nefretiri Rogoff, Joshua Rogoff, and Fanny Valenzuela, failed to serve timely responses to the interrogatories despite being granted multiple extensions. The judge found that the failure to respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product, unless the party subsequently serves a response that is in substantial compliance. The judge ordered the plaintiffs to provide responses within 30 days and also granted monetary sanctions against the losing party.
