Dept. 27 
1:30 p.m. 
December 12, 2023 



 
Claimant Osman Argueta
 (“Claimant”), a minor, by and through their Guardian Ad Litem, Liliana
 Granadillo (“Petitioner”), has agreed to settle his claims against
Defendant MNE Investments, LLC in exchange for $975,000.00.  If approved, $23,075.40
will be used for medical expenses,  $390,000.00
 will be used for attorney’s fees, and $205,533.13
will be used for non-medical expenses, leaving a balance of $356,391.47
for Claimant, $50,000 to be deposited in an insured account, subject to
withdrawal only on authorization of the court and $306,391.47 to be invested in
a single-premium deferred annuity, also subject to withdrawal only upon
authorization of the court.  
Court approval is required for all
settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Probate
Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code
Civ. Proc. § 372.)  The Court has
reviewed the proposed settlement and finds that it is fair and reasonable.  Further, the requested attorney’s fees, which
amounts to approximately 40% of the total settlement, is fair and reasonable.
The unopposed Petition to approve
minor’s compromise is GRANTED.
The Court sets an OSC for
________________ for proof of deposit. 
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 7.953(a).) 
If an acknowledgement of receipt by the financial institution is filed
before that date, no appearance will be required.
Per California Rules of Court, Rule
7.952, Petitioner and Claimant must appear at the hearing, unless the Court
finds good cause to excuse their appearance. 
The Court finds that Claimant’s appearance is not necessary but will
require Petitioner to appear.
Moving party to give notice.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org indicating
intention to submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided
on the court website at www.lacourt.org. 
Please be advised that if you submit on the tentative and elect not to
appear at the hearing, the opposing party may nevertheless appear at the
hearing and argue the matter.  Unless you
receive a submission from all other parties in the matter, you should assume
that others might appear at the hearing to argue.  If the Court does not receive emails from the
parties indicating submission on this tentative ruling and there are no
appearances at the hearing, the Court may, at its discretion, adopt the
tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
