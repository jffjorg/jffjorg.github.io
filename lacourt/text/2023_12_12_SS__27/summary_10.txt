And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies Moshfegh Defendants' motion to quash Plaintiff's subpoena for production of records from Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company in part. The court orders Nationwide to produce records specifically related to the October 28, 2021 incident. The court also modifies the subpoena to exclude requests for financial, billing, or proprietary information.

The court finds that the subpoena is, at best, poorly written, but will read it as intended: a request for records specifically related to the October 28, 2021 incident. The court quashes the subpoena as to the request for records related to the 2019 Mercedes, which appears to be overbroad and irrelevant.

The court does not award sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel of record, finding that Plaintiff successfully opposed at least part of the instant motion.

The court's ruling is subject to modification based on further submissions from the parties and potential appearances at the hearing.
