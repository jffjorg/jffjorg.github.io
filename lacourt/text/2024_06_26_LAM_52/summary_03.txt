And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant, Inland Empire Health Plan's, motion to continue the trial and all pretrial deadlines. The defendant argued that it needs more time to conduct discovery due to new allegations in the second amended complaint, but the judge finds that the defendant did not show good cause for the continuance. The defendant also stated that it needs time to explore resolution with the plaintiff, but the parties have not agreed on a mediator for mediation. The judge would consider continuing the trial if the parties submit a stipulation and proposed order that includes the name of a mediator and a mediation date, as well as the names of all individuals that must be deposed and a schedule for the depositions.
