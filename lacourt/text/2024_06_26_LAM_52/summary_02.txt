Significant Statements:
  - "A party propounding interrogatories may move to compel further responses when an answer 'is evasive or incomplete,' '[a]n exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate,' or '[a]n objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.'" (CCP § 2030.300(a))
  - "A party who 'fails to serve a timely response' to interrogates 'waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product.'" (CCP § 2030.290(a))
  - "Making, without substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery is also a misuse of the discovery process subject to monetary sanctions." (CCP § 2023.010(e))
