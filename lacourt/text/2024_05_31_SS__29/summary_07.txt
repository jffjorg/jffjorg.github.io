**Case Summary**

The judge's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff's motion for terminating, issue, evidence, and monetary sanctions against Defendants Extended Stay America, Inc. and ESAP. The court finds that the destruction of the bench by hotel staff did not constitute spoliation as no litigation was pending or probable at the time of the destruction. The court concludes that the duty to preserve evidence is triggered only when a party is objectively on notice that litigation is reasonably foreseeable, and the mere possibility of litigation is not sufficient.
