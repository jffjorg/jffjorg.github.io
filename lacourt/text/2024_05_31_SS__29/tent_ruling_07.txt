 Case Number:  22STCV06786    Hearing Date:   May 31, 2024    Dept:  29 Plaintiff’s Motion
for Terminating, Issue, Evidence, and Monetary Sanctions 
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
On February 24, 2022, Plaintiff Molly Jean
Sliwoski (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendant Extended Stay
America, Inc.; ESA P Porfolio Operating Lessee, LLC (“ESAP”); and Does 1
through 100, asserting causes of action for negligence and premises
liability.  Plaintiff alleges that on September 29, 2020, while
Plaintiff was visiting a guest at Defendant’s premises, she sat on a bench, the
bench collapsed, and she sustained injuries as a result.
On March 30, 2022, ESAP filed its answer.
On July 21, 2022, Plaintiff amended the complaint
to name ESH Hospitality, Inc., as Doe 1.
On September 19, 2022, Defendant ESA Management,
LLC (“ESAM”), erroneously sued as Extended Stay America, Inc. and ESH
Hospitality, Inc., filed its answer.
On June 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”).  On June 16, 2023, ESAP and ESAM (collectively,
“Defendants”) filed an answer to the FAC.
On April 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion
for terminating, issue, evidence, and monetary sanctions against Defendants.  Defendants filed an opposition on May 17, along
with their own request for monetary sanctions. 
Plaintiff filed a reply on May 21. 
Legal Standard
“The intentional destruction of evidence is a grave affront to
the cause of justice and deserves our unqualified condemnation.”  (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center v. Super. Ct.
(1998) 18 Cal.4th 1, 4.)  
“Destroying evidence can destroy fairness and justice, for it
increases the risk of an erroneous decision on the merits of the underlying
cause of action.  Destroying evidence can
also increase the costs of litigation as parties attempt to reconstruct the
destroyed evidence or to develop other evidence, which may be less accessible,
less persuasive, or both.”
(Id. at p. 8.)  
Under the case law, spoliation is defined to include (among
other things) destroying evidence, altering evidence, or “the failure to
preserve evidence for another’s use in pending or future litigation.”  (Williams v. Russ (2008) 167
Cal.App.4th 1215, 1223.)  “The duty to
preserve relevant evidence is triggered when the party is objectively on notice
that litigation is reasonably foreseeable, meaning litigation is probable and
likely to arise from an incident or dispute and not a mere possibility.”  (Victor Valley Union High School Dist. v.
Super. Ct. (2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 1121, 1133.)  The mere existence of a dispute or awareness of
an underlying incident that subsequently gives rise to litigation is not, in
and of itself, sufficient.  (Id.
at pp. 1153-1154.)
Spoliation, when it occurs, is a misuse of the discovery
process.  (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,
supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 12; Williams, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th at p. 1223.)  The remedies under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.030 for a misuse of the discovery process include (a) a monetary
sanction; (b) “an issue sanction ordering that
designated facts shall be taken as established in the action”; (c) “an evidence
sanction by an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process from introducing designated matters in evidence”; and, in the
most serious cases, (d) “a terminating sanction.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subds.
(a)-(d).)  The
discovery remedies set forth in section 2023.030 “provide a substantial
deterrent to acts of spoliation, and substantial protection to the spoliation
victim.”¿ (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 17.)
As
with all sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act, the purpose of sanctions for
spoliation is not to punish. (Newland v.
Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super
Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery
sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a
better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the law. 
(Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th
1164, 1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)  
Terminating sanctions
should be used sparingly. (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009)
174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.)  Nonetheless, a terminating sanction may be appropriate in the first
instance, without a violation of a prior court order, “in egregious cases of
intentional spoliation of evidence.” (Williams, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th at
p. 1223.)
“[A] party moving
for discovery sanctions based on the spoliation of evidence must make an
initial prima facie showing that the responding party in fact destroyed
evidence that had a substantial probability of damaging the moving party’s
ability to establish an essential element of his claim or defense.”  (Williams,
supra, 167 Cal.App.4th at p. 1227.)  Under some circumstances, this may be sufficient
to establish a “prima facie showing of prejudice” from the loss of the evidence
and to shift the burden to the party who has destroyed the evidence to disprove
the prejudice.  (Ibid.)
Discussion
Plaintiff alleges that she was
injured when a bench on Defendants’ premises collapsed.  Plaintiff asserts that Defendants’ disposal
of the bench was spoliation and warrants sanctions under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.030.
The accident occurred on September
29, 2020, at approximately 5:40 pm. 
(Farahi Decl., Exh. A.)  According
to an Incident Report prepared by Danielle Smith, who was at the time of the
incident the general manager, Ms. Smith spoke with the injured party, who “claimed
that she was fine and that her arm/elbow would bruise up and nothing more.”  (Id., Exh. A & Exh. C [“Smith Depo”]
at 36:25-37:2, 40:21-41:6, 105:3-9.)  
“GM [general manager] notified
DM [district manager] and has a picture of the broken bench on file.  GM inspected the bench to determine the
cause.  Apparently a screw came out of
the bench loosening the side as it was no longer connected and holding the seat
together.  GM discarded [the] bench as it
was damaged beyond repair.” 
(Farahi Decl., Exh. A.)
In her deposition, Ms. Smith testified that
she spoke to Plaintiff and her friend Debra Warren shortly after the accident.  (Smith Depo., at 93:10-14.)  Plaintiff “said that she was fine and
concerned about her friend, Ms. Warren.” 
(Id. at 93:25-94:1.)  “Ms.
Warren refused medical and said that her elbow and her arm were a little banged
up.”  (Id. at 94:1-2.)  Plaintiff refused medical treatment.  (Id. at 94:7-17.)  
After speaking to Plaintiff and Ms. Warren, Ms.
Smith dragged the broken bench from the accident scene to the trash
enclosure.  (Id. at 63:10-64:18, 99:2-5.)  She did this, she stated in her deposition,
so that others would not be injured by it. 
(Id. at 63:13-18, 100:18-23.) 
Ms. Smith determined that the bench was damaged beyond repair.  (Id. at 114:13-115:17.)  The bench was subsequently picked up by the
hotel’s waste management company and trashed. 
(Id. at 102:25-103:4.)
A little more than two months after the accident,
on December 2, 2020, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a letter to the hotel demanding
that all relevant evidence be preserved. 
(Ball Decl., Exh. B.)  The letter
inaccurately states that the accident occurred on October 6, 2020.  (Ibid.)
This action was filed in February 2022.
Plaintiff now requests terminating, issue,
evidentiary, and monetary sanctions due to the disposal of the bench by Ms.
Smith.  
The Court has carefully considered all of the
evidence in the record and the arguments of counsel.  On this record, the Court concludes that
there is no showing that any spoliation occurred.  Ms. Smith disposed of the bench almost immediately
after the accident.  (Smith Depo., at
63:10-64:18, 99:2-5.)  Ms. Smith
testified that she did so out of a concern that someone else could be injured
by the bench, which appeared to her to be damaged beyond repair.  (Id. at 63:13-18, 100:18-23, 114:13-115:17.)  At the time, the only information that Ms.
Smith had received was that Plaintiff was not injured at all and that Ms.
Warren had minor injuries and refused medical treatment.  (Id. at 93:25-94:17; Farahi Decl.,
Exh. A.)
Viewing the facts objectively, it was
certainly theoretically possible in the immediate aftermath of the accident that
the accident could give rise to litigation. 
But the mere possibility of litigation and/or knowledge of an incident
that subsequently gives rise to litigation is not, itself, sufficient to
trigger the duty to preserve relevant evidence. 
(Victor
Valley Union High School Dist. v. Super. Ct. (2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 1121, 1153-1154.)  “The duty to preserve relevant evidence is
triggered when the party is objectively on notice that litigation is reasonably
foreseeable, meaning litigation is probable and likely to arise from an
incident or dispute and not a mere possibility.”  (Id. at p. 1133; see also Williams
v. Russ (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1223.) 
The collapse of a bench in which no one sustained any significant
injuries – which is all that Defendants’ representative Ms. Smith was aware of
when she decided to dispose of the bench – does not put Defendants on notice,
objectively, that litigation was “probable” or “likely to arise.”
This case does not present the situation in which, when
relevant evidence was discarded, litigation was pending, or threatened, or even
probable.  To be sure, the bench is and
was relevant evidence, but there is no spoliation when evidence, even relevant
evidence, is discarded or not preserved at a time when no litigation is pending
or probable or likely to arise.  (Victor
Valley Union High School Dist., supra, 91 Cal.App.5th at p. 1133; Williams,
supra, 167 Cal.App.4th at p. 1223.)  
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion for sanctions
is denied.
Defendants’ request for monetary sanctions is
also denied.  Assuming (without deciding)
that sanctions can be awarded under the Civil Discovery Act for an unsuccessful
motion for spoliation sanctions, the Court finds that even though Plaintiff’s
motion is not successful, Plaintiff has acted with substantial justification in
pursuing it.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES
Plaintiff’s motion for terminating, issue, evidence, or monetary sanctions.
The Court DENIES
Defendants’ request for sanctions. 
Moving Party is ordered to give notice.
