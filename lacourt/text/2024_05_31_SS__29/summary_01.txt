Significant Statements:
- "The purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties' pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute." (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843)
- "Courts 'liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.' (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389)"
```

And here is a summary in English of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment without prejudice due to procedural issues. The motion was filed late and the notice and supporting papers were not served on all parties to the action at least 75 days before the hearing date. The judge did not reach the merits of the motion. The denial is without prejudice, meaning that the motion can be refiled.
