 Case Number:  22STCV32107    Hearing Date:   May 31, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Consolidate Cases filed by Plaintiff
Christine Tanaka
 
Tentative
 
The motion is denied without
prejudice.
 
Background
 
Two
related cases arise out of a vehicle accident on October 2, 2020, on the
southbound 5 Freeway near to the intersection with the 2 Freeway in Los Angeles.

 
On
August 17, 2022, in Case No. 22STCV26733, Beth Gellar filed a complaint against
Sunrise Dressingrooms, Inc. (“Sunrise”), Robert McLellan (“McLellan”), and Does 1 through 50. 
On September 29, 2022, McLellan and Sunrise filed their answer.
 
On
September 30, 2022, in this case, Case No. 22STCV32107, Christine Tanaka (“Tanaka”)
filed a complaint against McLellan, Sunrise, Amazon Content Services, LLC (“Amazon
Content”), and Does 1 through 25.  On June
5, 2023, McLellan and Sunrise filed an answer. 
On August 7, 2023, McLellan, Sunrise, and Amazon Content filed an
amended answer.  On December 5, 2023,
Plaintiff amended her complaint to name Pickrow, Inc. d/b/a Pictures in a Row (“Pickrow”)
as Doe 1.  On January 18, 2024, Pickrow
filed an answer to the complaint. 
 
On
January 5, 2024, the Court determined that the two actions are related.  Both cases are now assigned to Department 29
in the Spring Street Courthouse.
 
On May 10, 2024, Tanaka filed this motion to consolidate
the two cases. 
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
“When
actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the
court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue
in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such
orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or
delay.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048 (a).)
 
The
trial court should not consolidate actions where prejudice would result any
party, e.g., when consolidation would cause a litigant to need to adopt adverse
litigations positions in a single trial. 
(See State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1956) 47 Cal.2d
428, 430.)
 
Per
Local Rule 3.3, subdivision (g), “Cases may not be consolidated unless they are
in the same department.  A motion to
consolidate two or more cases may be noticed and heard after the cases,
initially filed in different departments, have been related into a single
department, or if the cases were already assigned to that department.”  (Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule
3.3(g)(1).)  Once the Court relates the
cases, the Court may consolidate the actions and order a joint trial on matters
that “involv[e] a common question of law or fact.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §1048, subd. (a).) 
 
California
Rules of Court rule 3.350 states:
 
“(a) Requirements of motion
 
(1)   
A notice of
motion to consolidate must:
 
(A)  List all named
parties in each case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names of
their respective attorneys of record;
(B)  Contain the
captions of all the cases sought to be consolidated, with the lowest numbered
case shown first; and
(C)  Be filed in
each case sought to be consolidated.
 
(2)   
The motion to consolidate:
 
(A)  Is deemed a
single motion for the purpose of determining the appropriate filing fee, but
memorandums, declarations, and other supporting papers must be filed only in
the lowest numbered case; 
(B)  Must be served
on all attorneys of record and all nonrepresented parties in all of the cases
sought to be consolidated; and
(C)  Must have a
proof of service filed as part of the motion.”
 
Discussion
 
Tanaka
requests that the two related cases, Case No. 22STCV26733 and Case No. 22STCV32107,
be consolidated for all purposes.  
 
There
are a number of mandatory procedural requirements for a motion to consolidate
set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 3.350.  One of these is that the motion must list all
named parties in each case, all names of those who have appeared, and all
counsel of record.  (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.350(a)(1)(A).)  Another mandatory
procedural requirement is that the motion must contain the caption of all cases
sought to be consolidated.  (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.350(a)(1)(B).)  A third mandatory
procedural requirement is that the notice of motion must be filed in each case
sought to be consolidated.  (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.350(a)(1)(C).)  None of
that was not done here.  Accordingly, the
Court must deny the motion, without prejudice, on procedural grounds.
 
The
Court is aware that a stipulation was attached to the moving papers.  There is, however, no signature on the
stipulation on behalf of Pickrow, one of the parties in Case No. 22STCV32107.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES, without prejudice, on
procedural grounds, the motion to consolidate Case Nos. 22STCV26733 and 22STCV32107.
