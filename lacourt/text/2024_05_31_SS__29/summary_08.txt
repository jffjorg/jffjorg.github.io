And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies, without prejudice, the motion to consolidate two related cases, Case No. 22STCV26733 and Case No. 22STCV32107, filed by Plaintiff Christine Tanaka. The motion was denied on procedural grounds due to the lack of compliance with mandatory procedural requirements outlined in California Rules of Court, rule 3.350. The court determined that the two cases are related and assigned to the same department. The motion to consolidate was filed without proper notice and evidence of signature from one of the parties, Pickrow, Inc. d/b/a Pictures in a Row. The court concludes that the motion to consolidate is denied, without prejudice, on procedural grounds.
