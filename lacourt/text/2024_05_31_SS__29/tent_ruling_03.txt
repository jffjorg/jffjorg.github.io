 Case Number:  21STCV30664    Hearing Date:   May 31, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Respond to Requests for Production
(Sets Two & Three) filed by Defendant Vanis Mikaelian.
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
The request for sanctions is denied.
Background
On August 19, 2021, Daniel Romero
Garcia (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Vanis Mikaelian, Lyft
Corporation, and Does 1 through 50 for negligence arising out of an automobile
accident; the complaint identifies the date of the accident as August 22, 2021,
which appears to be a typographical error (as it is two days after the
complaint was filed).
 
On March 2, 2023, Lyft, Inc. (erroneously
sued as Lyft Corporation) filed an answer. On April 26, 2023, Defendant Vanis
Mikaelian (“Defendant”) filed an answer.
 
On February 15, 2024, Defendant
served Plaintiff with Requests for Production (Set Two).  (Ross Decl., ¶ 3 & Exh. A.)  On March 8, 2034, Defendant served Plaintiff
with Requests for Production (Set Three). 
(Id., ¶ 5 & Exh. B.) 
Plaintiff did not respond.  (Id.,
¶ 9.)
 
On May 3, 2024, Defendant filed this
motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Request for Production of Documents
(Sets Two & Three).  Defendant also
seeks sanctions.
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When
a party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) Requests for admission may be
propounded on a party without leave of court 10 days after the service of the
summons on, or appearance by that party, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.020(b).)
Discussion
As a preliminary matter, the Court
notes that a memorandum of points and authorities regarding a trial continuance
was attached – perhaps inadvertently – to the memorandum in support of this
motion to compel.  No motion to continue
trial is set for hearing in this matter, and so the Court will address any
issue regarding trial scheduling.
 
As it relates to the motion to
compel, Defendant served Plaintiff with Requests for Production (Set Two) and
Requests for Production (Set Three). (Ross Decl., ¶¶ 3, 5 & Exhs. A, B.)  Plaintiff never responded to the discovery
requests.  (Id., ¶ 9.)
 
Defendant need not show anything
more.
 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Request for
Production of Documents (Sets Two & Three).
 
Defendant’s requests for sanctions are
DENIED.  The applicable statute, Code of
Civil Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision (c), authorizes an award of
sanctions against any party or attorney “who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” a
motion to compel initial responses to requests for production.  Here, Plaintiff did not oppose the motion.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS the motion
to compel. 
 
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff
to serve verified, written, code compliant responses, without objections, to Defendant’s
Requests for Production (Set Two) within 14 days of notice. 
 
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff
to serve verified, written, code compliant responses, without objections, to Defendant’s
Requests for Production (Set Three) within 14 days of notice. 
 
The
Court DENIES Defendant’s request for sanctions.
 
Moving party
is ORDERED to give notice.
