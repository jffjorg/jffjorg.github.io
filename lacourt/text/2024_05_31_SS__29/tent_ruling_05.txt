 Case Number:  21STCV34911    Hearing Date:   May 31, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Deem Bragg Investment to Have Admitted the
Truth of the Matters Specified in Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission (Set Two)
 
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
These two consolidated cases arise
out of an automobile accident on November 1, 2019, on the 405 Freeway in Long
Beach.
 
On September 22, 2021, in Case No. 21STCV34911,
Tai Ha (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Bragg Investment Company, Inc. (“Bragg
Investment”), Joshua Shane Gatton, and Does 1 through 50.  On September 30, 2021, in Case No. 21STCV35951,
Philip Rafle filed a complaint against Joshua Gatton, Bragg Investment, Bragg
Crane Service, and Does 1 through 20.
 
The two cases matters were related on
February 22, 2022, and consolidated on September 21, 2022.
 
On March 26, 2024, Plaintiff served
Requests for Admission (Set Two) (the “RFAs”) on Bragg Investment.  (Hong Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh. 1.)  Prior to the filing of the motion, Bragg
Investment had not served verified responses to the RFAs.  (Id., ¶ 6.) 
 
On May 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed this
motion for a deemed-admitted order.  On
filing, the hearing on the motion was set for May 31, 2024.  The trial is set for June 5, 2024.
 
No timely opposition was filed.  On May 28, 2024, Bragg Investment’s attorney
filed a declaration attaching copies of verified responses to the RFAs, with
the verification apparently served on May 24, 2024. 
 
Legal Standard
 
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision
(d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to
respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
"Except as otherwise provided in this
chapter, any party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery
proceedings on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery
heard on or before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of
the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a).) 
Discussion
On March 11, 2024, the Court granted
Defendants’ agreed upon ex parte application, continued the trial date to June 5,
2024, and reset all discovery deadlines based on the new trial date.  As a result, under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2024.020, subdivision (a), the last day for discovery motions to be
heard in this case was on May 21, 2024.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion is
untimely.  On that basis, it is denied.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion
for a deemed-admitted order.
 
Moving party
is ORDERED to give notice.
