On September

Does 1 through 50 for negligence and premises liability causes of action
arising out of a slip and fall occurring on September 30, 2019.
 
On
January 5, 2023, Ralphs Grocery Company dba Ralphs filed an answer.
 
On April 22,
2024, Danil J. Rafii of Rafii & Associates (“Rafii”)

Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
Rafii and
Berkley have filed the Notice, Declaration, and Order to be relieved as counsel.

In both Declarations,
Rafii and Berkley state there are irreconcilable differences between counsel
and Plaintiff. Rafii and Berkley served Plaintiff by mail and confirmed
Plaintiff’s current address by mail, telephone and conversation with Plaintiff.

The Orders include
the FSC and trial date, but have omitted the September 17, 2024 Order to Show
Cause hearing regarding dismissal.
The Court finds
Counsel has established good cause to be relieved due to the breakdown of the
attorney-client relationship.  All
substantive and procedural requirements are satisfied.
Accordingly, the
motion is GRANTED.
Each of the two proposed
orders must be modified to list, in item 8, the Order to Show Cause re
Dismissal scheduled for 9/17/24 at 8:30 am in Dept. 29. 
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is GRANTED.
The Judicial
Assistant is directed to modify each of the two proposed orders to add, in item
8, the Order to Show Cause re Dismissal scheduled for 9/17/24 at 8:30 am in
Dept. 29. 
The order is
effective upon the filing with the Court of a proof of service showing service
of the signed order on Plaintiff.
Moving counsel
to give notice.
