Tentative
 
The
motion is denied, without prejudice, for procedural reasons.
 
Background
 
On September 8, 2020, Ashkan
Loghmani (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against City of Los Angeles; Los
Angeles Department of Water and Power; Palisades Luxury Estates, LLC; and Does
1 through 100 asserting causes of action for (1) dangerous condition on public
property under Government Code sections 830 & 835, et seq., (2) Negligence
– negligent hiring & supervision under Government Code sections 815.2(a),
815.4, 815.6 & 820(a), (3) Premises Liability, and (4) General Negligence,
arising out of a bike accident occurring on July 27, 2019, on or near Milwood
Avenue in Venice. On November 10, 2020, Plaintiff filed the First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”), asserting the same causes of action against the same defendants.

 
On January 5, 2021, City of
Los Angeles and City of Los Angeles acting by and through the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power (“City”) filed an answer.
 
On May 12, 2021, the Court
entered an order, based on a stipulation, dismissing all causes of action
asserted in the FAC against Palisades Luxury Estates, LLC.
 
On filing, the case was
assigned a trial date of March 8, 2022. The Court, based on a stipulation,
continued the trial date to July 22, 2022; and then to July 17, 2023; and then
to January 29, 2024. Based on a further stipulation, the Court in December 2023
continued the trial date to June 24, 2024.
 
On April 3, 2024, City filed a motion for
summary judgment, with the hearing date set for May 31, 2024. The motion and
supporting papers were served electronically on April 5, 2024. Plaintiff filed
an opposition on May 17, 2024. Defendants filed a reply on May 24.
 
Legal Standard
 
“The purpose of the law of summary judgment
is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in
order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary
to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25
Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c),
“requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence
submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and
uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary
judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits
or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact within
the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993)
12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991)
231 Cal.App.3d 367, 381-382.)
 
As to each cause of action as framed by the
complaint, a defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that one or
more elements of the cause of action ... cannot be established, or that there
is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf
v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the
defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that
a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action
or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar,
supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851.)
 
A plaintiff or cross-complainant moving for
summary judgment or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of
proof by presenting facts to show “that there is no defense to a cause of
action if that party has proved each element of the cause of action entitling
the party to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(p)(1).) Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has met that burden, the
burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show that a “triable issue
of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense
thereto.” (Ibid.)
 
The party opposing a motion for summary
judgment or summary adjudication may not simply “rely upon the allegations or
denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set forth the specific facts
showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable issue of material
fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive
evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)
 
Courts “liberally construe the evidence in
support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning
the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.
(2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
 
Discussion
 
Before reaching
the merits, the Court addresses certain procedural issues.
 
The Legislature
has established clear rules regarding the timing of summary judgment motions. 
 
One of these is
that a summary judgment motion “shall be heard no later than 30 days before the
date of trial, unless the court for good cause orders otherwise.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subd. (a)(3).)
 
Another is that “Notice
of the motion and supporting papers shall be served on all other parties to the
action at least 75 days before the time appointed for hearing.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subd. (a)(2).) Additional time is added for service by mail,
facsimile, express mail, or overnight delivery. (Ibid.) The Court has no
power to shorten this time period. (Urshan v. Musicians’ Credit Union (2004)
120 Cal.App.4th 758, 763-766; McMahon v. Super. Ct. (2003) 106
Cal.App.4th 112, 116; see also 3 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide:
Civil Procedure Before Trial (2023) ¶ 10:80.5.) 
 
City complied
with neither of these rules. 
 
The hearing date
is less than 30 days before trial, and the Court has not previously issued an
order finding good cause for a hearing date less than 30 days before
trial.  
 
City did not
serve its notice and its supporting papers at least 75 days before the hearing.
 
For these
procedural reasons, the motion is denied.
 
As the Court does
not reach the merits of the motion, the denial is without prejudice.
 
Conclusion
The Court DENIES the motion for summary
judgment without prejudice for procedural reasons.
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
