And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has reconsidered its earlier ruling in this case after the defendant provided additional information about how Cross-Defendant's manufacturing, designing, assembling, or distributing relates to the occurrence of the incident. The judge has determined that the defendant's cross-complaint is not yet adequately supported, but it is willing to give the defendant another chance to provide more information. The judge has also noted that the defendant failed to provide exhibits in their opposition and has given the defendant an opportunity to reschedule the mandatory settlement conference. The judge has also warned the defendant that they may face sanctions if they continue to fail to comply with court rules.
