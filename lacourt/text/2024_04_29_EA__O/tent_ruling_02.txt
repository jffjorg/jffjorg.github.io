[1] According
to the instant motion, Plaintiffs’ orthopedic injuries are so severe
that Plaintiffs allege a combined $810,000.00 in damages.  
 


[2] Defendant alleges
that Viking was responsible for manufacturing, designing, assembling, and/or
distributing the product to Plaintiffs, and that these were the cause of
Plaintiff’s injuries.  According to the
court’s minute order, issued by Judge Daniel M. Crowley, the court reversed
its tentative ruling because of the following reason: “[w]hile in the
cross-complaint and moving papers, Defendant had not articulated how
Cross-Defendant's manufacturing, designing, assembling, or distributing relates
to the occurrence of the incident, at argument, Defendant laid out its basis
for the cross-complaint.”


[3] According to the
minute order, though Viking “correctly points out that equitable indemnity
requires that Cross-Defendant and Cross-Complainant be joint tortfeasors that
Cross-Defendant be at fault to Plaintiff,” “[h]owever, Cross-Complainant
does allege that Cross-Defendant is a joint tortfeasor at fault to Plaintiff.”
In addition, the other pertinent allegation the court found suffices to
allege comparative fault is the Defendant’s allegation that “the tip over
hazard was a known defect at the time the subject fridge was
manufactured/designed/distributed/sold by Viking Range, when there were
alternative safer designs at the time of the
manufacture/design/distribution/selling of the Refrigerator.” (emphasis added).

 


[4] Thus, briefs were
due by 2/5/24. 
 


[5] On February 8, 2024,
the clerk for Department G advised that as Plaintiffs were the only party to
submit their MSC briefs, the MSC was being placed off calendar. 


[6] The
court notified the parties that Defendant’s opposition while referencing
exhibits did not provide said exhibits. The 4/23/24 filing provides the
exhibits. 


[7] L.A. Sup.Ct. Rule §
3.245 provides as follows: “The court may hold a mandatory settlement
conference in each case before trial. The settlement conference shall be
scheduled a sufficient time after the exchange of appraisals to allow the
parties to conduct expert depositions and engage in settlement discussions. All
counsel and all persons with settlement authority must attend the settlement
conference in person, unless prior arrangements have been made with the court
for that person to appear by telephone.” L.A. Sup.Ct. Rule § 3.10 provides as
follows: “The court may impose appropriate sanctions for the failure or refusal
to comply with the rules in this chapter, including the time standards and/or
deadlines, and any court order made pursuant to the rules.” 
 


[8] None of Plaintiffs’ cited cases are
factually analogous. 
 


[9] Defense Counsel in
opposition also states that when she learned of the problem, she responded that
same day “apologizing and letting the Court and Plaintiffs’ counsel
know this was simply an inadvertent calendar error, offered to file a brief
quickly, and offered to attend the MSC on another date that may be convenient
to the settlement.” (Opp. p. 5, emphasis added.) In Reply, however, Plaintiffs’
Counsel contends otherwise: “No offer to reschedule the MSC was ever provided.”
(Reply p. 2:22-23.) But according to an email dated 2/8/24, Defendant did indicate
that they are “prepared to attend the MSCD on the 15th or on another
date.” (4/23/24 Opp. Ex. A, p. 8 of 58 of PDF.) 
 


[10] “Section 177.5 “was
designed to supplement section 128.5,
which authorizes a trial court to order a party or a party's attorney, or both,
to pay to another party reasonable expenses incurred by that party as a result
of bad faith actions or tactics which are frivolous or solely intended to cause
unnecessary delay.” (Id. at p. 446.) 
 


[11] And absent a
declaration providing the Lodestar factors, it is unclear whether $7,760.00 in
costs associated with this motion and the MSC is reasonable.
