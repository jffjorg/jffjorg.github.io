Legal Standard
 
A demurrer
tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer must appear
on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) In relevant part, a demurrer may be
filed on the grounds that the pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action or that it is uncertain. (Code Civ. Proc. §
430.10(e), (f), respectively.) A
demurrer on the grounds that the statute of limitations (SOL) bars the
claim(s), the untimeliness must “appear clearly and affirmatively…upon the face
of the complaint.” (Valvo v. Univ. of Southern California (1977) 67
Cal.App.3d 887, 895; Mangini v. Aerojet-General Corp. (1991) 230
Cal.App.3d 1125, 1155.) 
 
 
 
Discussion
 
Defendants demur to the entirety of the FAC on the
predominant grounds that the nine COAs asserted against them are time barred.
(Demurrer p. 8:25-26.) As the opposition does not dispute the facts that
Defendants rely upon, the court turns to the FAC. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiffs do not appear to dispute that the
statute of limitations. Instead, they conclusively argue that (1)
Equitable Tolling (based upon Plaintiffs’ voluntary dismissal of the federal
action) and (2) Delayed Discovery exceptions apply (“[d]ue to the gaslighting
and concealment by Defendants and their representatives, Plaintiffs did not
fully understand the nature of their injuries and new injuries until well into
adulthood and filed the instant action once such injuries were identified.” (Opp.
p. 3.) 
 
In Reply, as to both, Defendants provide a thorough analysis
and extensive case citations. 
 
Thus, as
leave to amend would be futile in this case wherein facts are not dispute, the
court, prior to making its ruling, requests supplemental briefing such that
Plaintiffs are to respond to the Reply and Defendants may file a sur-reply.
