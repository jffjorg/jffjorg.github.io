And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is about a case where the defendants (Monina Carlos, Carlos Mendoza, and Maria Mata) are seeking to strike certain language from the cross-complaint filed by the plaintiff (Ninnette Rodriguez Lopez). The plaintiff alleged motor vehicle liability and general negligence, while the defendants alleged indemnity, comparative contribution, and declaratory relief.

The court notes that the defendants did not meet and confer with the plaintiff's counsel before filing the motion to strike, as required by California law. The defendants also filed the motion to strike after the deadline, but the court decides to address the motion on its merits.

The court grants the motion to strike, finding that the language in the cross-complaint regarding attorney's fees is not relevant or pertinent to the claims made in the cross-complaint. The court relies on the precedent set in Watson v. Department of Transportation, which held that there is no basis for a claim of implied indemnity under which the cross-complainant (Maria Mata) could be entitled to attorney's fees.

The court concludes that the motion to strike is granted without leave to amend, and the moving party is ordered to give notice.
