MOTION
Defendant,
Cross-Plaintiff, and Cross-Defendant Purchasing 411, Inc., which the parties
refer to as Royalty Distribution, negotiated a purchase of gloves from
Defendant, Cross-Defendant, and Cross-Plaintiff Stop C-19 LLC (“Stop
C-19”).  Royalty Distribution sent a
deposit to Stop C-19, which transferred the deposit to Gredale LLC
(“Gredale”).  Royalty Distribution
contends Stop C-19 and Gredale failed to deliver the gloves and wrongfully
retained Royal Distribution’s deposit.  Royalty
Distribution moves for monetary sanctions against Gredale and Stop C-19.  Royalty Distribution also moves for an order
to show cause why Gredale and Stop C-19 should not be held in contempt of
court.  Gredale and Stop C-19 oppose the
motion.
 
ANALYSIS
In a contempt
proceeding, “an affidavit must be presented to the court stating the facts
constituting the contempt, an order to show cause must be issued, and hearing
on the facts must be held by the judge.” (Arthur v. Superior Court of Los
Angeles County (1965) 62 Cal.2d 404, 407–408.)  When the court receives the affidavit, it
issues an order to show cause (OSC) why the person should not be held in
contempt.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
1212.)  The alleged contemnor may respond
to the affidavit and OSC by submitting counter affidavits or declarations.  (Lyon v. Superior Court of Los Angeles
County (1968) 68 Cal.2d 446, 452.)  
In its order of
November 15, 2023, the court ordered Gredale and Stop C-19 to pay sanctions in
the amount of $3,000 to Royalty Distribution within 30 days.  To date, Gredale and Stop C-19 have not paid
the sanctions.  (Declaration of Dan
Terzian, ¶ 16.)  However, to be
punishable as contempt, the failure of Gredale and Stop C-19 to pay the
sanctions must be a conscious refusal, meaning Gredale and Stop C-19 are able
to pay the sanctions, but they refuse to do so. 
(Chapman v. Superior Court (1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 194, 200.)  
Royalty
Distribution’s affidavit in support of the motion must recite the specific
facts supporting the conclusion Gredale and Stop C-19 are in contempt of court,
including their ability to pay the sanctions. 
(See In re de la Parra (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 139, 144.)  In connection with its moving papers, Royalty
Distribution does not advance any evidence regarding the financial condition of
Gredale and Stop C-19 to show they can pay the sanctions.  As such, the court will not issue the order
to show cause why the court should not hold Gredale and Stop C-19 in contempt.  While Royalty Distribution purports to present
evidence of Stop C-19’s financial condition in its reply brief, the court will not
consider that evidence, as Gredale and Stop C-19 have not had the opportunity
to respond to it.  (See In re Marriage
of Hoffmeister (1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 1163, 1171.)
Royalty
Distribution also seeks sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section
128.5.  That statute permits the court to
award attorney fees a party incurred “as a result of bad-faith actions or
tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.5, subd. (a).)  There is no evidence before the court of
Gredale’s and Stop C-19’s failure to pay the sanctions was in bad faith or
frivolous, or that it was designed to cause unnecessary delay.  The Court, therefore, declines to award
sanctions under Section 128.5.
The Court also
declines to impose additional monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act.
 The court finds the only purpose of such
sanctions in this instance would be punitive, which is improper.  (See Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle of Los
Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.)  Royalty Distribution’s remedy is to enforce
the prior sanctions order as a monetary judgment.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 680.230. 680.270, 699.510,
subd. (a); see also Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608,
615 [because a monetary sanction order has the force and effect of a money
judgment, it is enforceable through the execution of judgment laws].)
Royalty
Distribution is ordered to give notice of this order and file proof of service
of same.
