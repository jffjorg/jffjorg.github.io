And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel a physical examination of the defendant. The defendant is required to appear at Quest Diagnostics in Miami, Florida on August 27, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. EDT for an intravenous blood draw by a licensed phlebotomist. Prior to the blood draw, the defendant must provide a government-issued photo identification card to an authorized representative of the plaintiff's counsel for identification. The judge finds good cause to order the examination and notes that the parties previously agreed to an examination on June 5, 2024, and then subsequently agreed to another examination on July 10, 2024, but the defendant failed to appear. The judge also notes that the prior tests provided by the defendant have deficiencies and that the plaintiff has provided a declaration from an expert witness, Dr. Gary Richwald, which describes these deficiencies.
