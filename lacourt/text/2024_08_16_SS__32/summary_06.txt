And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting defendant's motion for terminating sanctions against plaintiff Trenna Jones for failure to comply with a discovery order compelling her deposition. The judge found that plaintiff failed to appear at two noticed depositions and did not appear for a deposition on June 19, 2024, despite being ordered to do so. The judge also found that plaintiff was ordered to pay $1,372.60 in monetary sanctions, but did not comply with the order. As a result, the judge granted the motion for terminating sanctions and dismissed the complaint against defendant The Vons Companies, Inc. without prejudice. The judge also dismissed the entire complaint, as the only remaining defendants are unnamed Doe defendants. The judge ordered defendant to provide notice of the ruling and file a proof of service of such.
