OPPOSING PARTY:   None            BACKGROUND   Defendant Perfect Parking, Inc. (“Defendant”) moves to compel  Plaintiff Andres Aguilar-Maldonado to provide further responses to Requests for  Admissions, Set One and Request for Production of Documents, Set One. No  opposition has been filed.   LEGAL  STANDARD   Compel  Further Responses to Request for Production    Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310(a) provides that  on receipt of a response to a request for production of documents, the  demanding party may move for an order compelling further responses if:¿  ¿  (1) A statement of compliance with the demand is  incomplete.¿  (2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate,  incomplete, or evasive.¿  (3) An objection in the response is without merit or too  general.¿¿    A response  consisting of an objection must specify with particularly the document being  objected to, and, if based on privilege, must provide sufficient factual  information for other parties to evaluate the merits of this claim, including  if necessary, a privilege log. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240 (b), (c).)  ¿  The motion must set forth specific facts showing good cause  for the discovery and include a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc. §  2031.310(b).)    “Unless notice of this motion is given within 45 days of  the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or  on or before any specific later date to which the demanding party and the  responding party have agreed in writing, the demanding party waives any right  to compel a further response to the demand.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §  2031.310(c).)¿¿¿    The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7  (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who  unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a  demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with  substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of  the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310 (h).)    Compel  Further Responses to Request for Admissions   Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.290(a) provides that  on receipt of a response to requests for admissions, the party requesting  admissions may move for an order compelling a further response if that party  deems that either or both of the following apply:¿  ¿  (1) An answer to a particular request is evasive or  incomplete.¿  (2) An objection to a particular request is without merit  or too general.¿    If a party fails to serve a timely response, they waive any  objection to the requests, including one based on privilege or on the  protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010).  The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver. (Code Civ. Proc.  § 2033.280(a).)     The court shall impose a monetary sanction against any  party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to  compel further response, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction  acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the  imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.290(d).)     DISCUSSION¿   Here, after several extensions, Plaintiff served objections  only to Requests for Admissions, Set One and Request for Production of  Documents, Set One, on April 23, 2024. (Donavan Decl.  ¶ 5.) The parties met and conferred and agreed to additional extensions,  including an extension of time to file motions to compel further responses. (Id.  ¶ 8.) The parties participated in an informal discovery conference, wherein  counsel for Plaintiff notified Defendant that substantive responses were not  served due to the inability to confer with Plaintiff. The following day,  Plaintiff’s counsel filed and served a motion to be relieved. No opposition has  been filed to the motions to compel further responses and therefore no argument  is presented regarding the objections. Accordingly, the Court grants the  motions to compel further responses to Request for Admissions and Request for  Production.   Defendant seeks monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,698.50,  representing 4.9 hours for each motion. Although Defendant requests additional  monetary sanctions for the anticipated time to file a reply and attend a  hearing, no opposition has been filed. Moreover, the amount requested is  excessive given the nature of the motions. Accordingly, the Court awards  monetary sanctions in the amount of $430 for each motion (2 hours of attorney  time at $215 per hour).   CONCLUSION  AND ORDER   Therefore, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s motions to compel further responses.  Said responses are due within 30 days.   Plaintiff shall pay $860 in monetary sanctions to counsel for  Defendant within 30 days.   Defendant to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
