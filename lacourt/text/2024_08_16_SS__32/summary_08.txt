Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by Plaintiff Ryan Caldwell's counsel, Khashayar Eshraghi, to be relieved as counsel. The motion is based on a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. However, the judge notes that the declaration in support of the motion states that Plaintiff was served by mail, but does not provide proof of service. Additionally, the proposed order does not contain the correct Courthouse address and does not set forth the dates set in this case.

The judge conditionally denies the motion to relieve counsel, pending proof of proper service on Plaintiff. The judge orders counsel to file an amended proposed order within 5 calendar days of the hearing and to serve the signed order within 10 days of the date of the order. Counsel must also file a proof of service of the signed order. Until the updated proposed order is filed and served, counsel will remain the attorney of record for Plaintiff.
