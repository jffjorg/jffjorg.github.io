And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to reinstate the case filed by Plaintiffs Dennis Castillo and Brenda Alvarez. The case was previously dismissed without prejudice in 2023, but Plaintiffs have since reached a settlement with the defendants. The judge finds that the Plaintiffs' representation that the parties have reached a settlement and the lack of opposition to the motion warrant setting aside the dismissal. The judge orders the case to be reinstated for the limited purpose of a hearing on a petition for approval of a minor's compromise, to be filed and served within 30 days. The matter is set for an Order to Show Cause Re Dismissal (Settlement) for October 16, 2024.
