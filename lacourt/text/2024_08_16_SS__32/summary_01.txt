And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering two motions to amend the answers to the complaint and cross-complaint filed by Sully-Miller Contracting Company. The motions seek to add an affirmative defense for "Completed and Accepted Doctrine" to the answers. The judge finds that the procedural requirements are met and that Sully-Miller has shown good cause for the amendment. The judge also notes that Sully-Miller first appeared in the case in late-March 2024 and conducted a deposition in June 2024, indicating that it was not dilatory in bringing the motion. The judge concludes that the amendment is necessary and proper and grants the motions to amend the answers. Sully-Miller is ordered to file and serve the amended answers within 10 days.
