TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


August
  16, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


22STCV16190




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  for Terminating Sanctions   




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant The Vons Companies, Inc. 




OPPOSING PARTY:


None
  



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Defendant The Vons Companies, Inc. (“Defendant”) moves
for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff Trenna Jones (“Plaintiff”) for
failure to comply with the Court’s May 28, 2024 discovery order compelling her
deposition. No opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“To
the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method
or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected
party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may
impose…sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the
discovery process.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 2023.030.) The court may impose a
terminating sanction for misuse of the discovery process by any of the
following: “(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings
of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process; (2) An order
staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed; (3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that
party; (4) An order rendering a judgment by default against that party.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(d).)  Failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery, or
disobeying
a court order to provide discovery, constitutes a
misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d), (g).)

 
“The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse
‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the
party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the
propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the
discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 377, 390,
quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 1225, 1246.)   
 
“Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be
made lightly.  But where a violation is
willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’” (Los Defensores,
supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390 [citation omitted].)    
 
“Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating
sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders.”
(Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 citing Lang, supra, 77
Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244-1246 [discussing cases]; see, e.g., Collisson &
Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 [terminating
sanctions imposed (by striking the defendant’s Answer and subsequently granting
default judgment) after defendants failed to comply with one court order to
produce discovery]; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 481, 491, disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen (1997)
16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4 [terminating sanctions imposed against the plaintiff
for failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating various
discovery statutes].)  
 
“If that party or party-affiliated deponent then fails to obey an
order compelling attendance, testimony, and production, the court may make
those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) against that party deponent or against the party with whom
the deponent is affiliated. In lieu of, or in addition to, this sanction, the
court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against that deponent or against the party with whom that party
deponent is affiliated, and in favor of any party who, in person or by
attorney, attended in the expectation that the deponent's testimony would be
taken pursuant to that order.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450(h).) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
On
May 22, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s former counsel’s motion to be
relieved as counsel. Plaintiff is currently self-represented.  
 
On
May 28, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s
deposition. The deposition was first noticed in September 2023. (Min. Order,
5/28/24.) The Court found that Plaintiff had failed to appear at two noticed
depositions and ordered Plaintiff to appear for a deposition within 20 days. (Id.)
Plaintiff was also ordered to pay $1,372.60 in monetary sanctions. 
 
On
June 6, 2024, Defendant mailed notice of the order to Plaintiff’s address
listed on the Order to Relieved Counsel. On that same day, Defendant also
mailed a Fourth Amended Notice of Taking Plaintiff’s deposition, set for June
19, 2024. (Macksoud Decl. ¶ 6.) Plaintiff did not appear for the deposition. (Id.
¶ 8.) 
 
Based on the above, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not complied
with the May 28, 2024 order. Therefore, monetary sanctions have been
insufficient to induce compliance.  Plaintiff
does not oppose this motion and therefore fails to set forth reasons for the
discovery abuse. Accordingly, the Court grants the motion.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions is GRANTED. The complaint as
to Defendant The Vons Companies, Inc. is dismissed without prejudice. As the
only remaining defendants are unnamed Doe defendants, the Court dismisses the
entirety of the complaint. All dates are advanced and vacated. 
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
