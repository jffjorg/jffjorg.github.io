Significant Statements:

  - "If service of summons is not properly and validly effectuated by one or more of the approved methods, California courts lack personal jurisdiction over the defendants, and any judicial actions taken without such service violates principles of fundamental due process and is therefore void." (County of San Diego v. Gorham, supra, 186 Cal.App.4th at 1226-1227)

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The defendant argues that the plaintiff failed to serve them properly, as they have not been residing at the address listed in the proof of service for more than one year. The plaintiff submitted a proof of service showing that the defendant was served by personal service on April 29, 2024, at 18010 Collins St, Encino, CA 91316-1031. However, the defendant submitted a declaration stating that they were not served at this address and have not lived there for at least one year. The judge finds that the proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that service was proper, but this presumption can be rebutted by contrary evidence. In this case, the defendant's declaration rebuts the presumption, and the judge finds that service was improper. Therefore, the defendant's motion to quash service of summons is granted.
