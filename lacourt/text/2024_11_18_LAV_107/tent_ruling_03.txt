COURT’S [TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:       
 
Motion
  to Quash Subpoena Duces Tecum 



[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: Granted
 
 
I.               
BACKGROUND
 
On April 24, 2022, Plaintiff Nelson
Alexander Rodriguez (“Plaintiff”) was driving a vehicle that collided with
Defendant Levy Sharon’s (“Defendant”) vehicle. (Complaint ¶¶ 3, 5.) On April
24, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant and Does 1 to 10
alleging causes of action for negligence and negligence per se. 
 
On October 22, 2024, Defendant
filed a motion to quash service of summons (the “Motion”). Plaintiff filed no
opposition.
 
II.            
PROCEDURAL
ISSUES
 
“A defendant, on or before the
last day of his or her time to plead or within any further time that the court
may for good cause allow, may serve and file a notice of motion. . .
[t]o quash service of summons[.]” (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10(a).) Generally, a
responsive pleading is due within thirty days after service of the summons.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 412.20(a)(3).) 
 
Plaintiff filed a proof of service
showing Defendant was served by personal service on April 29, 2024. (Proof of
Service filed 05/07/24.) Service of a summons “by personal delivery of a copy of
the summons and of the complaint to the person to be served . . .  is deemed complete at the time of such
delivery.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.10.) 
 
Defendant filed the Motion on
October 22, 2024, which is more than thirty days after service of the summons.
But Plaintiff has not objected or sought to strike the Motion as untimely, so
this court will consider the Motion. (See In re Marriage of Obrecht
(2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 1, 16-17.)
III.          
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
“A
summons may be served by personal delivery of a copy of the summons and of the
complaint to the person to be served.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.10.) 
 
“A
defendant, . . . may serve and file a notice of motion…to quash service of
summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.”
(Cal. Code Civ. Proc., §¿418.10(a)(1).) A defendant may move to quash
service of summons for lack of jurisdiction based on ineffective service of
process. (See Ziller Elecs. Lab GmbH v. Superior Court (1988) 206
Cal.App.3d 1222, 1229.)
 
When
a defendant moves to quash service of the summons and complaint, the plaintiff
has “the burden of proving the facts that did give the court jurisdiction, that
is the facts requisite to an effective service.” (Coulston v. Cooper
(1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 866, 868.) The plaintiff must establish the facts of
jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. (Aquila, Inc. v. Superior
Court (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 556, 568.) 
 
“The
filing of a proof of service declaration ordinarily creates a rebuttable
presumption that the service was proper, but only if the service declaration
‘complies with the statutory requirements regarding such proofs.’” (Lebel v.
Mai (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1154, 1164.) Further, that presumption may be
rebutted by contrary evidence submitted by a defendant. (See, e.g., Fernandes
v. Singh (2017) 16 Cal.App.5th 932, 941, fn. 6.)¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
If
service of summons is not properly and validly effectuated by one or more of
the approved methods, California courts lack personal jurisdiction over the
defendants, and any judicial actions taken without such service violates
principles of fundamental due process and is therefore void. (County of San
Diego v. Gorham (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1226-1227.)¿
 
IV.          
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant argues Plaintiff’s proof
of service does not satisfy the statutory requirements because “Plaintiff
failed to serve Defendant given that Defendant has not been residing at the
address listed in the proof of service for more than one year” and “Plaintiff
never offered any evidence indicating that this address was current and still a
valid address for Defendant.” (Motion pp. 3-4.)
 
Plaintiff submitted a proof of
service showing Defendant was served by personal service on April 29, 2024, at
18010 Collins St Encino, CA 91316-1031. (Proof of Service filed 05/07/24.)
Thus, Plaintiff’s proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that
service was proper. (See Lebel v. Mai, supra, 210 Cal.App.4th at 1163.)
 
However, that presumption can be
rebutted by Defendant’s contrary evidence. (See Fernandez v. Singh, supra, 16
Cal.App.5th at 941, fn. 6.)
 
Defendant submits a declaration
stating Defendant “was not served with the summons and complaint, nor was it
delivered to [Defendant] in any other authorized fashion.” (Levy Declaration ¶
3.) Defendant also states Defendant “was never served via personal service on
April 29, 2024” and has “not lived at 18010 Collins St., Encino, CA 91316-1031
for at least one year.” (Levy Declaration ¶¶ 3-4.) Defendant’s declaration
rebuts the presumption that Plaintiff was properly served by personal service
on April 29, 2024. 
 
Thus, this court finds that service
was improper.

For the
foregoing reasons, Defendant’s Motion is granted.
