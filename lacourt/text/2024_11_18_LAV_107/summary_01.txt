And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling in a case filed by Zeferino Juarez Vazquez against Uber Technologies, Inc. and others. The plaintiff was riding a bicycle when he was hit by a vehicle driven by defendants Caeros O. Durias and others. The defendants were providing services for Uber Technologies, Inc. at the time of the incident.

The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendants alleging causes of action for negligence and related claims. The defendant's counsel filed a motion to be relieved as counsel, which has not been opposed.

The judge denied the motion because the counsel failed to comply with Rule 3.1362(d) of the California Rules of Court, which requires that the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order be served on all parties who have appeared in the case. The counsel only served the documents on the plaintiff, but not on the other defendants or parties who have appeared in the case.
