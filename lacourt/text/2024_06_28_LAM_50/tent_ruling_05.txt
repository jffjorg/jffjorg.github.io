BALDWIN HILLS MULTIFAMILY LLC, et al.,
 
                        Defendants.


Case No.:

Hearing Time:

ORDER RE:  
 
MOTION TO COMPEL
  RESPONSES 
TO REQUESTS FOR
  SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE 
AND MONETARY
  SANCTION 




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTIONS


 



 
Plaintiff Vincent
Bowman (“Plaintiff”) moves for an order “compelling Defendants Baldwin Hills
Multifamily LLC and WinnResidential, to serve on them [sic] a response
to…Plaintiff’s Requests for Special Interrogatories and Requests for
Admissions, set one, which he served on Defendants Baldwin Hills Multifamily
LLC and WinnResidential on January 3, 2024…” 
Plaintiff’s motion will be continued to a
new date as set forth below. NO HEARING WILL TAKE PLACE ON JUNE 28, 2024.
   
Pursuant to the
Court’s power to “amend and control its process and orders so as to make them conform
to law and justice” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(8)), the Court orders
the parties in this case to participate in a meet and confer with the Court (“Informal
Discovery Conference” or “IDC”). Lead or other designated counsel for
the parties with full authority and
any self-represented parties are ordered to participate in person in an
IDC. 
It appears Plaintiff reserved an IDC for July 11, 2024 that
pertains to the discovery requests that are the subject of the instant motion.
On May 24, 2024, Plaintiff submitted an IDC Statement providing, inter alia,
that “[o]n January 3, 2024 defendants were served Discovery by Plaintiff. 5
months later plaintiff received the responces [sic] from defendant. All the
Discovery questions were objected to…” The Court notes that Plaintiff’s IDC
Statement indicates that it was “received” on May 24, 2024, not filed.  
Plaintiff must file the IDC form in Department 50 seven days prior
to the IDC, and the responding parties may file the same form in the department
setting forth a response three days prior to the IDC.   
Plaintiff must use the Court’s online reservation system to continue
the motion to a post-IDC discovery hearing date. The parties are ordered to
have with them whatever materials are needed to make the IDC session productive
and successful. Prior to the IDC date, lead or other designated counsel for the
parties with full authority, and any
self-represented parties are to meet and confer, in person or
via telephone in a further attempt to resolve as many of the
issues as possible before the IDC. (See CRC Rule 3.670, subd. (f)(2).)
If the parties resolve their discovery disputes before the IDC date, Plaintiff is ordered to take both the July 11, 2024 IDC and the
motion off calendar as soon as possible. 
Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of this Order.
