Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering a motion for attorney's fees filed by Plaintiff TAMIM, LLC. The motion is unopposed, and the judge has reviewed the facts of the case. The judge finds that Plaintiff is entitled to attorney's fees under the lease agreement, which provides that the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees. The judge calculates the fee as follows: the hourly rate of $300.00 per hour is reasonable, and the total hours reasonably expended by Plaintiff's counsel are 58.4 hours, totaling $17,250.00. Additionally, the counsel's request for an extra $1,800.00 for preparing the motion and replying to opposition is reasonable, but only $1,500.00 is awarded. The total awarded amount is $18,750.00.
