And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a denial of the motion to set aside the default and default judgment. The motion was filed by Truman Hedding, a defendant in a lawsuit brought by ELM TERRACE HOLDINGS LLC. Hedding argues that he was not properly served with documents via email and that the default judgment was untimely. However, the Judge finds that Hedding has not demonstrated grounds for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).

The Judge notes that Hedding was under the mistaken belief that no pleadings were being filed, and that he did not file a notice on any parties nor did he file a notice with the court that he was expressly consenting to email service. The Judge also finds that Hedding did not provide evidence demonstrating that he did not receive service of Plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions or Plaintiff's request(s) for default judgment.

The Judge also notes that the December 15, 2023 default judgment awards attorney's fees to Plaintiff in excess of the schedule set forth in Los Angeles Superior Court Local Rule 3.214, but Hedding does not cite any legal authority in support of his request to vacate the default judgment "as excessive."

The Judge concludes that Hedding's motion is denied, and that Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this Order.
