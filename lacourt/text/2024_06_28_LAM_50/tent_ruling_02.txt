[1]As discussed,
Hedding’s notice of motion states that Hedding moves “to set aside a default
and default judgment under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473(b) and on the equitable grounds of extrinsic fraud.” 


[2]Hedding appears to
cite to a request for entry of default judgment filed on September 5, 2023
which provides, inter alia, “Default previously entered on 1-4-22.” 


[3]In addition, as
discussed, Hedding also states that he moves to set aside the December 15, 2023
default judgment on the grounds of “extrinsic fraud.” (See Notice of
Motion.) Hedding does not appear to provide any analysis or legal authority to
support such argument. The Court also notes that Hedding filed a “Reply
Declaration of Truman Hedding” on April 12, 2024. The Court notes that “¿[t]he general
rule of motion practice…is that new evidence is not permitted with reply
papers.¿”¿(¿Jay¿v. Mahaffey¿(2013)
218 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1537.)
