the reply without citing to any supporting legal authority that “Defendants
also fail to recognize that the owner of real property cannot trespass on his
own land.” (Reply at p. 4:5-7.) The Court notes that “¿[p]oints raised
for the first time in a reply brief will ordinarily not be considered, because
such consideration would deprive the respondent of an opportunity to counter
the argument.¿” (American
Drug Stores, Inc. v. Stroh (1992)
10 Cal.App.4th 1446, 1453¿.) Thus, the Court declines to consider
the points raised by Ip for the first time in the reply.
