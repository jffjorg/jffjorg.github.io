And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case brought by Hedding against an unnamed defendant. Hedding has moved to set aside a default judgment that was entered on January 4, 2022, citing Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) and arguing that the default judgment was the result of extrinsic fraud. Hedding has provided a request for entry of default judgment filed on September 5, 2023, which shows that the default judgment was previously entered. Hedding has also filed a reply declaration on April 12, 2024, which is not permitted under the general rule of motion practice, as new evidence is not allowed with reply papers. The Judge notes that Hedding has failed to provide any analysis or legal authority to support his argument that the default judgment was the result of extrinsic fraud.
