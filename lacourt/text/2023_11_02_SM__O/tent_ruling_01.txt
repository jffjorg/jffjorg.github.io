TENTATIVE
RULING
            Plaintiffs’
Motion for Summary Adjudication as to Plaintiffs’ Firth, Third and Fifth Causes
of Action is DENIED.   There is a triable issue  regarding the amount of Plaintiff’s damages.  (Defendant’s Separate Statement ¶¶ 23-24, 26,
49, 52, 75, 78 and evidence referenced from the declaration of Robert Barnes
and Defendant.) 
 
            Defendant Gregory
Jon Kozak’s Objections to the declaration of Robert M. Resch nos. 1-2, 4, and 9
(exhibit B) are OVERRULED. The remaining objections nos. 3,5-8 are OVERRULED as
to the statements (admissions) made by Kozak. 
 The objection to the declaration
of Ronald Resch no. 15 is OVERRULED.
 
            Plaintiff’s
objections to the declaration of Gregory Jon Kozak nos. 2-22 are OVERRULED.  The remaining objections are not material to
the Court’s decision. (C.C.P. §437c,(q).
 
            
“A
plaintiff ...has met his or her burden of showing that there is no defense to a
cause of action if that party has proved each element of the cause of action
entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action. Once the plaintiff or
cross-complainant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the defendant or
cross-defendant to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts
exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (CCP §437c(p)(1).)   
 
            “[T]he
party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is
no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a
matter of law.’ [Citation.]” (Behnke v. State Farm General Ins. Co.
(2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1463; see also Nalwa v. Cedar Fair, L.P.
(2012) 55 Cal.4th 1148, 1153–1154.) “A plaintiff moving for summary judgment
establishes the absence of a defense to a cause of action by proving ‘each
element of the cause of action entitling the party to judgment on that cause of
action.’ [Citation.] The plaintiff need not, however, disprove any affirmative
defenses alleged by the defendant. [Citation.] Once the plaintiff's burden is
met, the burden of proof shifts to the defendant ‘to show that a triable issue
of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense
thereto.’ [Citation.] In meeting this burden, the defendant must present
‘specific facts showing’ the existence of the triable issue of material fact.”
(City of Monterey v. Carrnshimba (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1081.)  “The court's assessment of whether the moving
party has carried its burden—and therefore caused a shift—occurs before the
court's evaluation of the opposing party's papers.  Therefore, the burden on the motion does not
initially shift as a result of what is, or is not, contained in the opposing
papers.” (Mosley v. Pacific Specialty Insurance Company (2020) 49
Cal.App.5th 417, 434–435 [landlord’s failure to address issue of whether they
were aware of their tenant’s marijuana growing operation was not grounds to
grant summary judgment where moving party failed to satisfy its initial burden
as to the issue]; Thatcher v. Lucky Stores, Inc. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th
1081, 1086-1087 [court cannot grant summary judgment based merely on lack of
opposition; court must first determine if the moving party has satisfied its
burden].)   
 
            “In
general, the opposing party may not rely on the opposing party's own pleadings
(even if verified) to oppose the motion. (CCP § 437c(p); Roman v BRE Props.,
Inc. (2015) 237 CA4th 1040, 1054, 188 CR3d 537 [plaintiff must show
“specific facts” to defeat defendant's summary judgment motion and may not rely
on allegations of complaint].) A plaintiff may rely on the plaintiff's
pleadings to resist a summary judgment motion if the defendant's motion is
based on the legal insufficiency of the plaintiff's claims as alleged. (Hand
v Farmers Ins. Exch. (1994) 23 CA 4th 1847, 1853, 29 CR2d 258.” Cal. Judges
Benchbook Civ. Proc. Before Trial § 13.24 (2023).
 
 
I.               
Affirmative
Defenses
 
As a preliminary matter, Defendant raises the issue of their affirmative
defenses, including the claims are time-barred and comparative fault, as triable
issues of material facts existing to negate the Motion for Summary Adjudication
for all three causes of action. However, the 3-29-21 Waiver and Tolling
agreement, deemed enforceable by order of this Court on 7-17-23, expressly
waives the right of Defendant to assert any defenses “in response to any action
or proceeding arising out of the Debt or the Claims, which defenses are based,
in law or in equity, or the passage of time, including without limitation any
and all applicable statute of limitation and the defenses of laches, waiver,
and estoppel.” (Resch Decl., ¶ 14; Ex. C ¶ 2.1.)
 
Thus, pursuant to the signed Waiver and Tolling Agreement, the Defendant
is unable to raise any defenses in this matter, and therefore the Court finds
the Defendant’s affirmative defense arguments without merit. 
 
II.            
5th Cause of Action for Breach of Fiduciary Duty
 
"The elements of a claim for
breach of fiduciary duty are (1) the existence of a fiduciary relationship, (2)
its breach, and (3) damage proximately caused by that breach." (Mendoza
v. Continental Sales Co. (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1395, 1405.)
 
“A fiduciary relationship is any
relation existing between parties to a transaction wherein one of the parties
is in duty bound to act with the utmost good faith for the benefit of the other
party. Such a relation ordinarily arises where a confidence is reposed by one
person in the integrity of another, and in such a relation the party in whom
the confidence is reposed, if he voluntarily accepts or assumes to accept the
confidence, can take no advantage from his acts relating to the interest of the
other party without the latter's knowledge or consent....” (Wolf v. Superior
Court (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 25, as modified on denial of reh'g (Mar.
20, 2003).) Traditional examples of fiduciary relationships in the
commercial context include trustee/beneficiary, directors and majority
shareholders of a corporation, business partners, joint adventurers, and
agent/principal. (Id.)
 
A breach of fiduciary duty occurs
when a property manager diverts the principal’s funds for the manager’s own
use. (Apollo Estates, Inc. v. Department of Real Estate (1985) 174
Cal.App.3d 625, 640 (holding that a property manager’s use of funds that were “diverted
to [manager’s] own payment rather than paying the mortgage … was clearly a
breach of his fiduciary obligation.”].)
 
Plaintiffs argue they have
established all the elements of their 5th cause of action for Breach
of Fiduciary Duty:
 
1.    
A fiduciary relationship existed between Defendant and
Plaintiffs because Defendant was Plaintiffs’ property manager, an officer and
or director of Plaintiffs’ general partners, and a person entrusted with
Plaintiffs’ money (Separate Statement (“SS”), ¶ 5; Lederer Decl., ¶¶ 6, 13,
Exh. B; Resch Decl., ¶¶ 7, 14, Exh. C; Gregory Kozak’s Cross-Complaint, dated
March 14, 2022 (“Cross-Complaint”), Exh. 1 (Tolling Agreement), ¶¶ 1.1.)
2.    
There was a breach of the fiduciary relationship
because Defendant admitted to the diversion of Plaintiff’s funds for purposes
unrelated to Plaintiffs’ business. (SS, ¶ 34; Lederer Decl., ¶¶ 10, 13, Exh. B;
Resch Decl., ¶¶ 11, 14, Exh. C; Cross-Complaint, Exh. 1, ¶ 1.2.)
3.    
The Plaintiffs were damaged as a result of the
Defendant’s breach of fiduciary duty. The Plaintiffs allege the amount of
damages is $2,251,792 after a deduction of $52,500 in payments made by
Defendant. (SS, ¶¶ 23–26; Barnes Decl., ¶¶ 2, 4, 5, Ex. A-4, B; Resch Decl., ¶
14, Exh. C; Lederer Decl., ¶¶ 13, 14, 15, Ex. B, C; Cross-Complaint, Ex. 1.)
 
Plaintiffs point to evidence of a
ledger attached to an email sent by Defendant on March 11, 2021 as undisputed
proof of the exact amount of damages. (SS, ¶ 23; Barnes Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. B.)
However, within the email the Defendant never states the exact amount taken
from Plaintiffs. Defendant just mentions how he came about calculating the
figures, apologizing, and ends the email by stating “if something doesn’t look
right to you or I said the wrong thing please assume that I didn’t mean
anything by it,” adding a cloud of uncertainty to the calculations attached.
(See Barnes Decl., Ex. B.) Furthermore, the attached ledger includes numerous
figures and calculations, including the $2,251,792 figure, but it is not
certain that this is the figure owed to Plaintiffs, amount stolen, or something
else entirely. (See id.)
 
Thus, Plaintiffs have not met their
burden of proving the damages element for Breach of Fiduciary Duty against Defendant.

 
Even if Plaintiff was able to reach
their burden, Defendant points to evidence that damages are disputed including
the same email and ledger Plaintiff point to in Exhibit B of the Barnes
Declaration, but also further evidence of possible reductions in the total
amount owed. (See SS, ¶ 23; Kozak Decl. ¶¶ 3-14 at 2:4-28; 3:1-28; 4:1-28;
5:1-3.) These amounts include $300,000 and $400,000 the Defendant allegedly
borrowed from his father in 2012 to cover negative cash flow, and which
Defendant was unable to find documentation to include in his March 11, 2021
ledger. (See SS, ¶ 23l Kozak Decl., ¶¶ 12–14.)
 
Thus, Defendant has provided
evidence to create a triable issue of material fact as to damages. Plaintiffs’
Motion for Summary Adjudication for the 5th cause of action of
Breach of Fiduciary Duty is DENIED. 
 
III.          
1st Cause of Action for Fraud and 3rd
Cause of Action for Embezzlement (Conversion)
 
“The elements of an action for
fraud and deceit based on concealment are: (1) the defendant must have
concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant must have been under
a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have
intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the
plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of the fact and would not
have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or suppressed fact, and
(5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the fact, the plaintiff
must have sustained damage.” (Marketing West, Inc. v. Sanyo Fisher (USA)
Corp. (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 603, 612–613.)
 
“The elements for the cause of
action for constructive fraud are: (1) fiduciary relationship; (2)
nondisclosure (breach of fiduciary duty); (3) intent to deceive, and (4)
reliance and resulting injury (causation).” (Stokes v. Henson (1990) 217
Cal.App.3d 187, 197.)
 
“Conversion is the wrongful
exercise of dominion over the property of another.  The elements of a
conversion are: (1) the plaintiff's ownership or right to possession of the
property at the time of the conversion; (2) the defendant's conversion by a
wrongful act or disposition of property rights; and (3) damages.  It is
not necessary that there be a manual taking of the property; it is only
necessary to show an assumption of control or ownership over the property, or
that the alleged converter has applied the property to his own use.”  (Farmers
Ins. Exchange v. Zerin (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 441, 451-452.)
 
“A cause of action for conversion
requires allegations of plaintiff's ownership or right to possession of
property; defendant's wrongful act toward or disposition of the property,
interfering with plaintiff's possession; and damage to plaintiff. Money cannot
be the subject of a cause of action for conversion unless there is a specific,
identifiable sum involved, such as where an agent accepts a sum of money to be
paid to another and fails to make the payment.” (PCO, Inc. v. Christensen,
Miller, Fink, Jacobs, Glaser, Weil & Shapiro, LLP (2007) 150
Cal.App.4th 384, 395.)
 
Plaintiff again proves all but one
element of both Fraud and Embezzlement (or conversion) but cannot meet their
burden of proving the amount of damages is $2,251,792 (See supra,
Section II; SS, ¶ 23; Barnes Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. B; Kozak Decl. ¶¶ 3-14 at 2:4-28;
3:1-28; 4:1-28; 5:1-3)
 
Thus, Plaintiffs cannot meet their
burden of proving there is no triable issue of material fact and that they are
entitled to judgment as a matter of law for the 1st Cause of Action
for Fraud and 3rd Cause of Action for Embezzlement. Plaintiffs’
Motion for Summary Adjudication for the 1st and 3rd cause
of action is DENIED.
