  - "The party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."
  - "A plaintiff may rely on the plaintiff's pleadings to resist a summary judgment motion if the defendant's motion is based on the legal insufficiency of the plaintiff's claims as alleged."

The Judge's Tentative Ruling is that:

* The Motion for Summary Adjudication as to Plaintiffs' Fifth Cause of Action (Breach of Fiduciary Duty) is DENIED due to a triable issue of material fact regarding the amount of damages.
