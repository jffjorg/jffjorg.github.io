  - "The superior court must deny the motion to reclassify the case as limited (and thus keep the matter in the unlimited civil court) unless it appears to a legal certainty that the plaintiff's damages will necessarily be less than $25,000." (Ytuarte v. Superior Court, 129 Cal.App.4th 266)

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted defendant's motion to reclassify the case as a limited civil action. The plaintiff alleges that defendant's sanitation truck struck his parked car, and he seeks damages for negligence and breach of contract. However, the court has found that the plaintiff has failed to provide any substantive information or documentation regarding the extent of the damages, and has only provided a general estimate of "about $5,000". The court has concluded that it is clear to a legal certainty that the damages will not exceed $25,000, as required by statute. Therefore, the case will be reclassified as a limited civil action, and will be heard in a lower court with jurisdiction over cases with a value of $25,000 or less.
