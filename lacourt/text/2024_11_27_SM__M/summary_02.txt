Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motions filed by the defendants, H. Mitchell Kanner and Lucy M. Kanner, seeking reconsideration of the court's ruling on the application for entry of judgment, setting aside the interim settlement agreement or proposed judgment, and striking the plaintiffs' memorandum of costs.

The court finds that the stipulated judgment entered on behalf of the plaintiffs, Michael H. Goldstein and Emily S. Blumenthal, has no reasonable relationship to the range of actual damages that the parties could have anticipated from a breach of the interim settlement agreement. The court concludes that the stipulated judgment must be construed as a penalty and grants the motion to set aside the stipulated judgment.

The court also finds that the plaintiffs failed to establish a reasonable relationship between the stipulated judgment and the damages claimed, and that the judgment was not designed to compensate the plaintiffs for their loss of use of the money plus their reasonable costs in pursuing the payment. The court further finds that the stipulated judgment was not a reasonable attempt to estimate fair compensation for any loss that may be sustained by the plaintiffs for the defendants' failure to return possession by April 30, 2024, to pay the partial or per diem rents, to participate in the mediation, or to name the plaintiffs as additional insureds.

Accordingly, the court grants the motion to set aside the stipulated judgment and finds that the judgment is void under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(d).
