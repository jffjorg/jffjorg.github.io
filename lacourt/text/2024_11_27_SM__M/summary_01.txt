And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to compel further discovery responses from the defendant, Cookies Retail Products LLC, in response to the plaintiff's request for production of documents and special interrogatories. The judge finds that the defendant's responses to questions 27 and 28 of the special interrogatories are evasive and incomplete, and that the defendant has failed to provide complete and straightforward responses to the requests for production of documents. The judge orders the defendant to provide further responses to these requests within 30 days.

The judge also imposes sanctions on the defendant and its counsel in the amount of $7,160.00, which includes costs. The sanctions are to be paid to the plaintiff's counsel within 30 days.

The judge's ruling is based on the following facts: the defendant has failed to provide complete and straightforward responses to discovery requests, the plaintiff has incurred significant attorney fees and costs in pursuing the motion, and the defendant's privacy concerns are outweighed by the plaintiff's need for information directly relevant to enforcing its judgment.
