English-text summary:

The Judge has denied the Petitioner's petition for relief from Government Code 945.4. The Petitioner, Kevin Michael Chao, claims that he was attacked while golfing at Knollwood Country Club and is seeking relief from the County of Los Angeles, which he alleges is liable for his injuries. The Judge finds that the Petitioner failed to act as a reasonably prudent person under the same or similar circumstances and that his conduct does not constitute excusable neglect. Even if the Petitioner's conduct could be deemed to be excusable neglect, the Respondent has been prejudiced by the delay in filing the petition and has lost the ability to conduct an early investigation of the claim and consider early settlement.
