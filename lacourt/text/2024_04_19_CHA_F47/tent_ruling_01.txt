SUMMARY OF ACTION & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Maximilian Webb’s
(Plaintiff) purchase of a 2018 Ford F-150 (the Vehicle) on 1/14/19.  Plaintiff alleges that “[d]efects and
nonconformities to warranty manifested themselves within the applicable express
warranty period, including but not limited to, transmission defects, engine
defects, body defects; among other defects and nonconformities.”  (FAC ¶32). 

 
On 8/16/23, Plaintiff Maximilian I Webb (Plaintiff) filed
this action against Defendants Ford Motor Company (Ford) and Autonation Ford
Valencia (Autonation) for: (1) Violation of Civil Code 1793.2(d); (2) Violation
of Civil Code 1793.2(b); (3) Violation of Civil Code 1793.2(a)(3); 
(4) Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability (Civil
Code 1791.1, 1794, 1795.5); 
(5) Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment and (6) Negligent
Repair (not alleged against Ford).
 
On 9/18/23, Ford filed and served a demurer to the 1st
– 5th causes of action in the complaint which was set for hearing on
2/2/24.  On 1/22/24, nine court days
before the hearing, Plaintiff filed and served a First Amended Complaint which
rendered the demurrer moot.  See
CCP 472(a); CCP 1005(b).  As such, on
2/2/24, the Court placed the hearing on Ford’s demurrer to the original
complaint off calendar.  (See
2/2/24 Minute Order).  The First Amended
Complaint alleges the same six causes of action as the original complaint.    
 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the
issues Ford had with the 5th cause of action for Fraudulent
Inducement – Concealment alleged in the First Amended Complaint, on 2/23/24,
Ford filed and served the instant demurrer to the 5th cause of
action.  On 4/8/24, Plaintiff filed and
served his opposition to the demurrer and on 4/11/24, Ford filed and served a
reply to the opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer may be based on the ground that the complaint
fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.  CCP 430.10(e).  A demurrer admits the truth of all properly
pleaded facts regardless of how unlikely or improbable they may be.  See Aubry (1992) 2 C4th 962,
966-967; Del E. Webb Corp. (1981) 123 CA3d 593, 604.  Allegations in a complaint must be liberally
construed with a view toward substantial justice between the parties.  CCP 452. 

 
5th Cause of Action – Fraudulent
Inducement – Concealment
 
The elements of a fraudulent concealment cause of action
are: (1) concealment or suppression of a material fact, (2) a duty to disclose
the fact to the plaintiff, (3) intentional concealment or suppression of the
fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) that the plaintiff was
unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he/she did if he/she had known
of the concealed or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or
suppression of the fact, the plaintiffs sustained damage.  Boschma (2011) 198 CA4th 230, 248.  Additionally, every element of a fraud cause
of action must be alleged with factual specificity.  Cooper (1990) 219 CA3d 1252, 1262; Lazar
(1996) 12 C4th 631, 645.  Concealment of
a material fact is actionable when there is a duty of disclosure, which may
arise from a relationship between the parties, such as a buyer-seller
relationship.  Dhital (2022) 84
CA5th 828, 843-844, review granted, citing Hoffman (2014) 228 CA4th
1178, 1186-1187.  In such case, the
plaintiff must describe the content and where the omitted information should or
could have been revealed.  Tapia
(S.D. Cal. 2015) 116 F.Supp.3d 1149, 1163.
 
Plaintiff has failed to allege with the requisite
particularity the defect Ford allegedly concealed.  The First Amended Complaint merely describes
a list of ways in which Ford F-150s transmissions may be defective and
hazardous driving conditions relating generally to the purported transmission
defect but does not state what the alleged defect is in the Vehicle or
otherwise .  (FAC ¶¶47, 85).  Such allegations are insufficient to support
the fraud-based claim.  Santana
(2020) 56 CA5th 334, 345.
 
Plaintiff has also failed to adequately allege where the
omitted information should or could have been revealed by Ford and fail to
identify the requisite representative samples of advertisements, offers, or
other representations by Ford that consumers relied upon to make their
purchase. Additionally, Plaintiff does not identify by name who made the
alleged omissions when they purchased the Vehicle. 
 
Even if Plaintiff had pled an identifiable defect in the
Vehicle, Plaintiff has not alleged facts showing Ford had a legal duty to
disclose those facts.  “There are ‘four
circumstances in which nondisclosure or concealment may constitute actionable
fraud: (1) when the defendant is in a fiduciary relationship with the
plaintiff; (2) when the defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not
known to the plaintiff; (3) when the defendant actively conceals a material
fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when the defendant makes partial
representations but also suppresses some material facts.’”  LiMandri (1997) 52 CA4th 326, 336.  Regardless of the circumstances under which a
duty to disclose may arise, Plaintiff must allege facts to show that Ford was
aware of a defect at the time of sale.  Wilson
(9th Cir. 2012) 668 F.3d 1136, 1145.
 
Here, Plaintiff has failed to plead sufficient facts to
establish any of the above circumstances exist so as to give rise to a duty by
Ford to disclose to Plaintiff.  (See
FAC ¶89).  Plaintiff has also failed to
plead sufficient facts to show Ford was aware of the purported defect in the
Vehicle at the time of the sale to Plaintiff. 
(See FAC ¶¶47-48, 84-89(a)).    
 
 
In Dhital, relied on by Plaintiff, the plaintiffs
had alleged that they bought the vehicle at issue from a Nissan dealership,
that Nissan backed the vehicle with an express warranty, and that Nissan’s
authorized dealerships are its agents for purposes of the sale of the Nissan
vehicles to consumers.  See Dhital,
supra at 844.  Here, Plaintiff
makes no such allegation.  (See
FAC ¶¶27-28).  Even if Plaintiff had made
such agency allegations, the claim fails for other reasons.     
 
The First Amended Complaint concedes that Ford issued
publicly available TSBs regarding the alleged Transmission Defect.  (FAC ¶¶49-57).  As such, it is still not clear what additional
information regarding the transmission was purportedly concealed from the
dealerships and/or Plaintiff with whom it appears Ford had no direct
interaction.  The claim also appears to
be based, in part, on concealment that allegedly occurred after Plaintiff
purchased the Vehicle.  (FAC ¶87).  Information allegedly concealed after the
purchase (i.e., “at the time of . . . repair, and thereafter”) could not have
fraudulently induced Plaintiff to purchase the vehicle.  
 
Plaintiff has also failed to allege sufficient facts to
establish that the fraud claim is not barred by the “economic loss rule.”  “[T]he economic loss rule allows a plaintiff
to recover in strict products liability in tort when a product defect causes
damage to ‘other property,’ that is, property other than the product itself.  The law of contractual warranty governs damage
to the product itself.”  Robinson
Helicopter Co., Inc. (2004) 34 C4th 979, 989 citing Jimenez (2002)
29 C4th 473, 482-483.  Based on the
allegations in the First Amended Complaint, it still appears that the only duty
allegedly breached was that created by the terms of the warranty and the only
harm which resulted from Ford’s alleged concealment was that Plaintiff would
not have purchased the Vehicle.  (See
FAC ¶87).     
 
The holding in Robinson Helicopter was narrowly
limited to “a defendant’s affirmative misrepresentations on which a plaintiff
relies and which expose a plaintiff to liability for personal damages
independent of the Plaintiffs’ economic loss.” 
Robinson Helicopter, supra at 993; In re Ford Motor Co.
(C.D. Cal. 2020) 483 F.Supp.3d 838, 848. 
Here, the fraud claim is based on purported concealment, not affirmative
misrepresentations.  (FAC ¶¶83, 84, 87,
89, 90, 91)
 
Plaintiff’s reliance on Dhital, supra, for
the proposition that the fraud claim is not barred by the “economic loss rule”
is unpersuasive.  First, Dhital is
under review by the Supreme Court of California as to the economic loss rule;
therefore, it is not citable.  Second,
the Court of Appeal has recently held that unless there is a specific assertion
of agency in the complaint, there is no showing of agency between Ford and the
authorized dealerships.  See Ochoa
(2023) 89 CA5th 1324 (review granted 7/9/23). 
As noted above, Plaintiff has not made sufficient agency
allegations.  
 
Further, Plaintiff argues that the fraud claim is not
barred by the economic loss rule because “it has long been the rule that where
a contract is secured by fraudulent representations, the injured party may
elect to affirm the contract and sue for fraud.”  (See Opposition, p.3:5-8 citing Lazar
(1996) 12 C4th 631, 645; Freeman & Mills, Inc. (1995) 11 C4th 85,
108).  Presuming that concealment equates
to affirmative misrepresentations, the foregoing rule still does not seem to
apply in this case as Plaintiff alleges that he seeks to revoke acceptance of
the vehicle and/or rescind, not affirm, the purchase/contract from which the
warranty arises.  (See FAC ¶¶30,
38, 80).
 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer is sustained as to the 5th cause
of action for Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment for the reasons set forth
above.  Due to the liberal policy of
allowing leave to amend and because this is only the First Amended Complaint
and the first time Plaintiff’s pleading has been ruled on by the Court, Plaintiff
is given the opportunity to try to cure the defects in the 5th cause
of action.   
 
An amended complaint is due within 30 days.
