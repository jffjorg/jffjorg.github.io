 Case Number:  23VECV01030    Hearing Date:   September 5, 2024    Dept:  T HART V LASALLE 23VECV03010   TENTATIVE RULING:  PLAINTIFF'S EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR ORDERS: 1) TO SEAL MEDIATION  COMMUNICATIONS FROM UNRELATED CASE FILED BY ASHAN PEIRIS ON AUGUST 19, 2024  [Rule 2.550 (D)1 ]  The court denies the request.  Evidence Code section 1152 nor 1154 limit  what settlement communications can be used for, such as to prove the invalidity  of the claim or to prove a loss or damage.   None of these communications will be considered by the court nor will  the jury be allowed to see or hear these communications in this case.  The rules on the sealing of documents are  very strict as it is the policy of the State of California that all legal  proceedings, except as provided by law in certain types of judicial hearings,  be open to the public and public inspection.   The court would have to make the findings as set forth in Rule 2.550 and  does not find that the document as a whole should be sealed.  There is no technical ability at this court  to seal individual pages within a filed document.  However, the court will issue an  OSC re Sanctions in the amount of $500 against Ashan Peiris for violation of California  Evidence Code section 1119 which states" (c) All communications,  negotiations, or settlement discussions by and between participants in the  course of a mediation or a mediation consultation shall remain confidential."  An email discussing the mediation was  attached to a document filed by Mr. Peiris with the court.  The court can see no need to have publicly  filed that email or disclosed it to the court.   The OSC will be set on 10/23/2024 at 8:30 a.m. and written response to  the OSC shall be filed no later than 5 court days prior to the hearing. 2) FOR THE COURT TO RULE ON  PLAINTIFF'S TERMINATING MOTION A tentative ruling has been issued. 3) TO ADVANCE AND CONSOLIDATE ALL  MOTIONS RELATING TO LASALLE SROG NO. 1 AND RFP NO. 1  It is unclear which specific motions plaintiff  wishes to have advanced and to what date.   More specifics are requested.   Plaintiff should identify the name and scheduled dates of the motions  and to what date she wants them moved.   Clarity would be appreciated.  4) TO RULE ON PLAINTIFF'S PREVIOUS REQUEST FOR  EVIDENTIARY SANCTIONS SAPP & OBRIEN [AUG 16]  On 8/16/2024, the court held a hearing on, and  ruled on, 8 motions.  Among them were  discovery motions against defendant Sapp and defendant O'Brien. On the motions  as to defendants O'Brien and Sapp, the court granted monetary sanctions against  these defendants.  Anything else  requested was deemed denied.  The court will note that  concerning the "evidentiary sanction" to preclude defendants Sapp and  O'Brien from using certain documents at trial, that is ordinarily a remedy  which is ordered after been a violation of a court order to "produce"  documents. Otherwise, plaintiff can seek to limit evidence to be presented at  trial because it is irrelevant or improper by way of a timely motion in limine  which will be considered at the Final Status Conference.   ___________________________________________________________________ TENTATIVE RULING: PLAINTIFF'S  MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS: Plaintiff seeks a terminating  sanction against defendant Dupree for violation of two orders: one dated  4/15/2024 and one dated 2/7/2024.  The  court reviews the statutory authority for the motion as set forth in plaintiff's  notice of motion. Plaintiff seeks an order for  terminating sanctions or issue sanctions against defendant Dupree for violation  of two orders: one dated 4/15/2024 and one dated 2/7/2024.  Her motion is brought pursuant to CCP section  2023.030, 2031.280, and 177.5. CCP section 2031,280 has a 45 day  time limit to bring a motion the court ordered responses were served several  months ago so a motion under that section is untimely. CCP section 177.5 is a motion in  which the court can set a hearing to assess sanctions.  Plaintiff does not have standing under this  section. Finally, CCP section 2023.030  does provide a basis for plaintiff's motion and does not have a time  deadline.  each discovery method  authorizes a trial court to impose monetary sanctions, issue sanctions,  evidence sanctions, or terminating sanctions against a party engaging in  conduct amounting to a misuse of the discovery process. City of Los Angeles v.  PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 CA5th 466 Defendant Dupree filed his  opposition to the motion for terminating sanction on 9/4/2024.  It is untimely and will not be considered.  No declaration or explanation accompanied the  late filing. A terminating sanction is the  most severe penalty for violating a discovery order. The most drastic sanction  is the "terminating sanction."   It is "the procedural equivalent of capital punishment."  Morgan v. Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist.  (1987) 192 CA3d 976, 981.   Sanctions are  generally imposed in an incremental approach with terminating sanctions being  the last resort. Department of Forestry & Fire Protection v. Howell (2017)  18 CA5th 154, 191-92. See California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before  Trial (TRG 2023)  8:1215 et seq.   In New Albertsons, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2008)  168 CA4th 1403, 1427 the Court of Appeal held that only monetary sanctions are  authorized for the initial failure to respond to discovery or for insufficient  responses to discovery. The court already assessed monetary sanctions when the  orders were issued 2/7/2024 and 4/25/2024. The court has already issued  orders concerning the discovery and will not revisit those motions.  The only area of inquiry is whether the court  ordered responses evidence willful failure to comply with the court's discovery  order. When reviewing a motion for  issue, evidence and/or terminating sanctions, the court must examine the entire  record in determining whether the drastic sanction should be imposed. Deyo v.  Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 796 In exercising the Court's discretion, a  variety of factors may be relevant, including: -the time which has elapsed since  the discovery was served;  -whether the party received  extensions of time to answer or respond;  -the number of discovery requests  and the burden of replying; -the importance of the  information sought;  -whether the answering party  acted in good faith and with reasonable diligence-i.e., whether the answering  party was aware of the duty to furnish the requested information and had the  ability to do so; -whether the answers supplied  were evasive and incomplete; -the number of questions which  remained unanswered;  -whether the unanswered questions  sought information that was difficult to obtain; -the existence of prior court  orders compelling discovery and the answering party's compliance with them (see  Manzetti v. Sup. Ct. (1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 373, 379); -whether the party was unable to  comply with the previous order of the court; -whether an order allowing more  time to answer would enable the answering party to supply the necessary  information; and,  -whether a sanction short of  dismissal or default would be appropriate to the dereliction.   See Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro.  Before Trial (TRG 2023) 8:2205 citing Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal. App. 3d  771, 796-97. The sanction must relate to the  specific location. the court abuses its discretion when it imposes a sanction  order that goes beyond the evidence or issue which the discovery was  seeking.  See Caryl Richards, Inc. at  304, Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 CA4th 1495 and Karlsson v. Ford Motor Co.  (2006) 140 CA 4th 1202. There are "only two facts  are absolutely prerequisite to the imposition of sanctions: (1) there must be  failure to comply . . . and (2) the failure must be willful."  See Calvert Fire Ins. Co. v. Cropper (1983)  141 Cal.App.3d 901, 904, R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75  Cal.App.4th 486, 496 and Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978), 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 787 Lack of diligence may be deemed  willful in the sense that the party understood his obligation, had the ability  to comply, and failed to comply. Deyo v. Superior Court, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d  771, 787.   "A willful failure does not  necessarily include a wrongful intention to disobey discovery rules.  A conscious or intentional failure to act, as  distinguished from accidental or involuntary noncompliance, is sufficient to  invoke a penalty."  Deyo at 787-788. 2/7/2024 ORDER: The 2/7/2024 order was as to the  plaintiff's motion to compel RFP set 1 as to defendant Dupree. The court ordered:  "The court only considers  the requests in the Notice of Motion.   Any other requests in the body of the points and authorities will be  disregarded. As to RFP Set 1 Nos. 1 - 45 to  defendant Kyle Dupree: Grant.  The  responses were not Code compliant.  The  documents are relevant to the subject matter of the case or may lead to the  discovery of admissible evidence.  No  privilege log was attached.  Except for  attorney client privilege and attorney work product, all objections are  overruled.  Documents, except those  subject to the privilege log, shall be produced by paginating each page and  indicating which pages are responsive to which request for production.  (Example: RFP#1: Pgs. 1-25, 76-90, 203-207, RFP#2: Pgs. 27-400, 425-426, etc.)  Verified Code compliant responses  and production, including privilege log for attorney client privilege and  attorney work product, due within 20 days." On 2/27/2024, defendant Dupree  served his court ordered responses with production.  A motion to compel further  responses would be untimely.  Therefore,  the court reviews the responses to determine whether there was a willful  failure to comply with the court order. The court ordered responses were  ordered to be Code compliant.  The  discovery statutes identify what is meant by Code complaint. --That the request will be  allowed in whole. (CCP § 2031.220). This means that responding party is in  possession of the requested documents or things, and will produce them in the  manner indicated in the request; --That responding party is unable  to comply with the request because the requested document or thing has never  existed. (CCP § 2031.230). Responding party must make a "diligent search  and reasonable inquiry" into finding the requested items, and state in the  response that they have made this effort; --That responding party is unable  to comply because the requested items no longer exist, or are no longer in  their possession. (CCP § 2031.230).Responding party must make a "diligent  search and reasonable inquiry" into finding the requested items, and state  in the response that they have made this effort. They must also describe what  the items were, and explain what happened to them. If known, they must include  the name and address of the person or organization in possession of the  requested items; or --That responding party will  produce some, but not all, of the requested items, because some of the  requested items no longer exist, or are no longer in their possession. (CCP §  2031.230). They must make a "diligent search and reasonable inquiry"  into finding the requested items, and state in the response that they have made  this effort. They must describe which items will not be produced, and why they  cannot be produced. The court finds that following  responses are Code compliant:  9, 33, 34,  38, 39, 40, 45.  These cannot be the  basis for granting the motion. The court finds that the  privilege log is compliant because it provides a factual description of  documents in aid of substantiating a claim of privilege. See Wellpoint Health  Networks, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 59 CA4th 110, 130 and Best Products,  Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 119 CA4th 1181.   These cannot be the basis for granting the motion. The following responses by  defendant Dupree were not Code compliant in that the specific statutory words  are not used:  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11. In  general, however, there is a clear intent to be compliant, documents were  identified and were produced or a privilege was asserted in the privilege log  and that there is substantial compliance. On the whole, therefore, given  that the court finds the vast majority of the responses are compliant, the  court cannot say that there was willful intent to violate the court's order  such that a terminating order is warranted. The motion for the terminating  order is denied. As to issue or evidence  sanctions, the court has to find that there was a willful failure to violate  the court's order in order to sanction.   There is no basis to do so as indicated by he court here on the  RFPs.  The motion for issue or evidence sanctions  on the RFP's is denied. 4/15/2024 ORDER: Plaintiff seeks terminating and  other sanctions concerning the failure by defendant Dupree to comply with the  court's order of 4/15/2024, as to SROGs 1, 9, 11, 13 & 23.   The court finds that the answer  to Special Interrogatory No. 1 is non-compliant.  The company knows who worked for it in  2018.  The company knows who signed W-9s  for it in 2018 just be asking its accountants or bookkeeper.  The court finds that there was a willful violation  of the court's 4/15/2024 order. Answer to Special Interrogatory  No. 11 is non-compliant because there is a failure to identify any of the  employees from Legacy Partners who were asked about the word on the wall.   Nos. 9, 13 and 23 are sufficient. The court now needs to determine  what the sanction should be for violating the court's 4/15/2024 order as to  nos. 1 (who signed the W-9) and 11 (who did he talk to about the writing on the  wall.) These violations do not warrant a  terminating sanctions. However, the court could issue evidence sanctions: 1.           The court orders that defendant Dupree is deemed to admit  that the words were written on the wall. 2.           The court orders that defendant Dupree cannot put on any  evidence or testimony about the Inc turning/converting into the LLC. The court also awards monetary  sanctions against defendant Dupree in the sum of $341.50 pursuant to CCP  section 2023.030 payable to Shelly Hart at her address of record by 10/5/2024.________________________________________________COURT
ORDER ON NAMES OF DEFENDANTS

On
9/7/2023, defendant LaSalle Investment Management, Inc. Erroneously Sued As
Maryland LaSalle Investment Management, Inc. filed its answer.

On
10/6/2023, an amended answer was filed by Defendant LASALLE INVESTMENT
MANAGEMENT, INC.  This answer has no
mention of Maryland LaSalle.

On
5/15/2024, a second amended answer was filed by Defendant LASALLE INVESTMENT
MANAGEMENT, INC. (formerly known as Maryland LaSalle Investment Management,
Inc.).

Despite
the operative answer being “Defendant LASALLE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, INC.
(formerly known as Maryland LaSalle Investment Management, Inc.)”,  Mr. Peiris has been filing papers on behalf of
defendant Maryland LaSalle Investment Management, Inc. which is not a defendant
in this case.  Mr. Peiris is ordered to
submit all further pleadings only using the name in the operative answer as Defendant
LASALLE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, INC. (formerly known as Maryland LaSalle
Investment Management, Inc.).  Similarly,
defendant LPF TRIANA, LLC (converted from LPF TRIANA, INC.) is the appearance
by this defendant in the last answer filed by it on 10/6/2024.  Despite this, Mr. Peiris is using the name LPF
TRIANA, LLC (erroneously sued herein as LaSalle Property Fund REIT, Inc. dba
LPF TRIANA, INC.).  There is no answer
for any such entity.

The court is perplexed WHY there are so many clerical
errors in Mr. Peiris’ pleadings, from misnaming his clients to using the wrong
caption. It is a waste of everyone's time. It is an embarrassment for Mr. Peiris and  theWilson, Elser firm.  Continued errors such as this
will result in further sanctions hearings. 

Ashan
Peiris and Wilson, Elser, et al. are ORDERED to use only the names for their
clients as they appear on their operative answers, and to use the correct
caption for this case on all documents, not the Sullivan caption.
