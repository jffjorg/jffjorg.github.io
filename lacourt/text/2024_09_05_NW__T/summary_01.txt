The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the dismissal of the case. The ruling states that no CCP 664.6 stipulation has been filed, and no written settlement agreement has been lodged. Furthermore, no evidence of a settlement has been provided to the court. As a result, the OSC re dismissal is discharged, and the notice of settlement is stricken. The case is reinstated to the active list, and a trial date is set for September 20, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. A final status conference is also set for September 13, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The parties are required to comply with the court's previous FSC/Trial order from February 26, 2024. The judge emphasizes that the trial date will not be vacated unless a written, enforceable settlement agreement is provided.
