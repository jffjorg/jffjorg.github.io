STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On December 7, 2021, Plaintiff 1st Source Bank
(Plaintiff) filed a Complaint against Defendants CTOUR Charter, LLC, CTOUR
Investment Holding, Inc., and Charlie Lu (Defendants) with five causes of
action for: (1) Breach of Lease Agreement; (2) Enforcement of Guaranty; (3)

According to the Complaint, there are two lease agreements
at issue: One executed March 22, 2018 and one executed April 20, 2018. These
agreements involve equipment rental. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants owe
$229,602.90 plus interest and reasonable attorneys’ fees. Plaintiff also
alleges that Defendant CTOUR Investment executed a Guaranty of Payment in
conjunction with the leases.
 
On February 24, 2022, Defendants CTOUR Charter, LLC and
CTOUR Investment Holding, Inc. filed an Answer.
 
On November 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for
summary judgment, or alternatively, motion for summary adjudication. 
 
On December 6, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Request for Dismissal
as to Defendant Charlie Lu only.
 
On December 22, 2023, Defendants filed an opposition to the
motion for summary judgment.
 
On January 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Summary
Judgment/Adjudication 
 
A party seeking summary judgment
has the burden of producing evidentiary facts sufficient to entitle him/her to
judgment as a matter of law.¿ (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(c).)¿ The moving party
must make an affirmative showing that he/she is entitled to judgment
irrespective of whether or not the opposing party files an opposition.¿ (Villa v. McFerren (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th
733, 742-743.)¿ Thus, “the initial burden is always on the moving party
to make a prima facie showing that there are no triable issues of material
fact.”¿ (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519 (citing
Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850.)¿ 
¿ 
When a plaintiff seeks summary
judgment, he/she must produce admissible evidence on each element of each cause
of action on which judgment is sought.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c(p)(1).)¿ When
a defendant seeks summary judgment, he/she has the “burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party has
shown that one or more elements of the cause of action, even if not separately
pleaded, cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the
cause of action.”¿ (Code of Civ. Proc. § 437c(p)(2).)¿ 
¿ 
The opposing party on a motion
for summary judgment is under no evidentiary burden to produce rebuttal
evidence until the moving party meets his or her initial movant’s burden.¿ (Binder v. Aetna Life Insurance Company (1999)
75 Cal.App.4th 832, 840.)¿ Once the initial movant’s burden is met, then the
burden shifts to the opposing party to show, with admissible evidence, that
there is a triable issue requiring the weighing procedures of trial.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc. § 437c(p).)¿ The opposing party may not simply rely on his/her
allegations to show a triable issue but must present evidentiary facts that are
substantial in nature and rise beyond mere speculation.¿ (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68¿Cal.App.4th 151, 162.)¿ Summary
judgment must be granted “if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences
reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences
or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and
that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”¿ (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992)
7¿Cal.App.4th¿1110, 1119.)¿¿ 
¿ 
As to any alternative request for
summary adjudication of issues, such alternative relief must be clearly set
forth in the Notice of Motion and the general burden-shifting rules apply but
the issues upon which summary adjudication may be sought are limited by
statute.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §¿437c(f)(1).)¿ “A motion for summary adjudication
shall be granted only if it completely disposes of a cause of action, an
affirmative defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of duty.”¿ (Ibid.)¿

ANALYSIS: 
 
First Cause of
Action – Breach of Lease
 
Plaintiff contends there are no triable issues of material
fact as to its first cause of action for breach of lease. Defendants contend
there are triable issues of material fact concerning Plaintiff’s notice
regarding the sale/disposition of the vehicles under each lease as well as the
amount of damages claimed by Plaintiff.
 
To state a claim
for breach of contract, a plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to establish
(1) a contract between the parties, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) damages to the plaintiff from
the breach. (Wall Street Network, Ltd. v.
New York Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178.)¿“As damages are an
element of a breach of contract cause of action [citation], a plaintiff cannot
obtain judgment on a breach of contract cause of action in an amount of damages
to be determined later.” (Paramount
Petroleum Corp. v. Superior Court (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 226, 241 (Paramount Petroleum).) 
 
Here, Plaintiff
met its initial burden to establish breach of lease. First, there is a contract
between the parties – namely, the March 2018 and April 2018 leases. (Separate
Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (SSUMF) Nos. 3, 7.) Second, Plaintiff
performed under the leases. (Rozenboom Decl. ¶¶ 7, 8, 12, 1, 14, 19.) Third,
Defendants breached by failing to pay the outstanding balance due pursuant to
the leases. (Rozenboom Decl. ¶ 18, Exhibit 7.) Fourth, Plaintiff suffered
monetary damages as a result of the breach. (Rozenboom Decl. ¶ 20.) 
 
Defendants have
not provided evidence showing a triable issue of material fact remains. First,
Ms. Ju’s declaration indicating that Defendants did not receive Plaintiff’s
October 29, 2021 letter is not evidence that Plaintiff did not provide notice.
(Ju Decl. ¶ 6.) ¿Second, Defendants have not shown a material factual dispute
as to damages. Unlike
in Paramount Petroleum, where the
moving party sought summary adjudication of liability only, here, Plaintiff has
not only sought summary adjudication of its entire breach of contract claim
(including damages) but also provided evidence supporting its damages
calculation. (Rozenboom Decl., Exhibit 8.) Defendants’ reliance on Paramount Petroleum is also misplaced
because damages in that case could not be reasonably calculated due to a
shifting scale for determining the price of crude oil. (Paramount Petroleum, supra, at pp. 231-232.) Here, leases provide a
Stipulated Loss Schedule which sets forth a how to calculate amounts owed.
(Rozenboom Decl., Exhibits 2, 3.) In response, Defendants’ argument that it
reached a different calculation is conclusory. (Ju Decl. ¶ 5.) Stated
otherwise, Ju’s conclusion of amount
owed does not create a triable issue
of material fact. 
 
Accordingly,
the court GRANTS summary adjudication of the first cause of action.
 
Second Cause of
Action – Enforcement of Guaranty
 
Plaintiff contends there are no triable issues of material
fact as to its second cause of action for enforcement of guaranty. Defendants
contend there are triable issues of material fact concerning Plaintiff’s notice
regarding the sale/disposition of the vehicles under each lease as well as the
amount of damages claimed by Plaintiff.
 
“A lender is
entitled to judgment on a breach of guaranty claim based upon undisputed
evidence that (1) there is a valid guaranty, (2) the borrower has defaulted,
and (3) the guarantor failed to perform under the guaranty.” (Gray1 CPB, LLC v. Kolokotronis (2011)
202 Cal.App.4th 480, 486).  
 
Alternatively,
Plaintiff’s claim can also be interpreted as a breach of contract claim.3 To state a claim for breach of contract, a plaintiff must
allege sufficient facts to establish (1) a contract between the parties, (2)
plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach,
and (4) damages to the plaintiff from the breach. (Wall Street Network, Ltd. v. New York Times Co. (2008) 164
Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178.)¿“As damages are an element of a breach of contract
cause of action [citation], a plaintiff cannot obtain judgment on a breach of
contract cause of action in an amount of damages to be determined later.” (Paramount Petroleum Corp. v. Superior Court
(2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 226, 241.)¿ 
 
For the same reasons discussed above, Plaintiff met its
initial burden and Defendants failed to show a material factual dispute.
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS summary adjudication of the
second cause of action.
 
Fourth Cause of
Action – Account Stated
 
Defendants contend that Plaintiff has not met its initial
burden because a cause of action for account stated cannot be based on the
instant lease contract claims.
 
“The essential elements of an account stated are: (1)
previous transactions between the parties establishing the relationship of
debtor and creditor; (2) an agreement between the parties, express or implied,
on the amount due from the debtor to the creditor; [and] (3) a promise by the
debtor, express or implied, to pay the amount due.” (Zinn v. Fred R. Bright Co. (1969) 271 Cal.App.2d 597, 600.) “An express contract,
which defines the duties and liabilities of the parties, whether it be oral or
written, is not, as a rule, an open account.” (Eloquence Corporation v. Home Consignment Center (2020) 49 Cal.App.5th 655, 665 (Eloquence) (quoting Durkin v.
Durkin (1955) 133 Cal.App.2d 238, 290.) An exception “may lie where the
parties had agreed to treat money due
under an express contract as items under an open book account.” (Ibid.) An express agreement is not necessary.
(Id. at p. 666.) But, “mere[ly]
recording in a book of transactions or the incidental keeping of accounts under
an express contract does not itself create a book account.” (Ibid.) 
 
Here,
Plaintiff has not met its initial burden showing it is entitled to summary
adjudication in its favor. First, Plaintiff provided no evidence supporting its
claim for account stated. As in Eloquence,
where the contract specifically defined obligation to pay specified amounts
during specified periods, here, the March 2018 and April 2018 Supplement and
Schedule A calls for the “monthly rental factor, monthly rentals, advance
payment, commencement date, final adjustment percentage, number of months in
term, expiration date and residual value.” (Ju Decl., Exhibit 1, Exhibit 2.) Plaintiff
provided no evidence, and did not argue, that the parties agreed to treat the
March 2018 or April 2018 contracts as open book accounts.
 
Accordingly,
the court DENIES summary adjudication of the fourth cause of action.
 
Fifth Cause of Action
– Open Book Account
 
Defendants contend that Plaintiff has not met its initial
burden because a cause of action for open book accounting cannot be based on
the instant lease contract claims.
 
To
establish a cause of action for open book account, the following elements must be satisfied: (1)
plaintiff and defendant had financial transactions, (2) plaintiff kept an
account of the debits and credits involved in the transactions, (3) defendant
owes plaintiff money on the account, and (4) the amount of money that the
defendant owes the plaintiff.  (State
Comp. Ins. Fund v. ReadyLink Healthcare, Inc. (2020) 50 Cal. App. 5th 422,
449.)  A book account is “open” if a balance remains due on this account. 
(Interstate Group Administrators, Inc. v.
Cravens, Dargan & Co. (1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 700, 708; Eloquence, supra, at pp. 664-665.) “An
express contract, which defines the duties and liabilities of the parties,
whether it be oral or written, is not, as a rule, an open account.” (Eloquence, supra, at
p. 665 (quoting Durkin v. Durkin
(1955) 133 Cal.App.2d 238, 290.) An exception “may lie where the parties had agreed to treat money due under an
express contract as items under an open book account.” (Ibid.) An express agreement is not necessary. (Id. at p. 666.) But, “mere[ly] recording in a book of transactions
or the incidental keeping of accounts under an express contract does not itself
create a book account.” (Ibid.)
 
Here,
Plaintiff has failed to meet its initial burden for the same reasons as the
fourth cause of action.
 
Accordingly,
the court DENIES summary adjudication of the fifth cause of action.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Motion
for Summary Adjudication is GRANTED as to the First and Second Causes of Action
and DENIED as to the Fourth and Fifth Causes of Action.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
