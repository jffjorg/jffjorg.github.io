And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling addresses a Second Amended Third-Party Complaint (TPC) filed by the Trustees against Peter, Aptco, and Anna-Marie. The Court acknowledges that the Trustees have substantially complied with the rules of court by including the proposed amended pleading and a redlined copy of the proposed amended pleading. The Court permits the amendment, finding that the new causes of action arise from the same basic facts as those originally pleaded and do not give rise to a wholly distinct and different legal obligation against the defendants. The Court also finds that the delayed discovery rule applies to the Trustees and that they are not estopped from making this argument. The Court rejects the moving defendants' argument that the Trustees are barred from making this argument because they previously argued that Roy Biondi was a partner in their motion to intervene. Finally, the Court notes that the sufficiency of proof can be challenged at a later stage, not at the pleading stage.
