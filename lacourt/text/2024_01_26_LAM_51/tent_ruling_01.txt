STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On October 22, 2021, Plaintiff Estate of Etsuko Toguri, by
and through Trustee Kathleen “Miki” Toguri (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint
against Anna Marie Pierotti, Peter Pierotti, and Aptco, LLC.

LEGAL STANDARD & ANALYSIS: 
 
Motion for Leave to
File Third Amended Third Party Complaint
 
Leave to amend is permitted under Code of Civil Procedure §
473(a) and § 576.  The policy favoring amendment and resolving all matters
in the same dispute is “so strong that it is a rare case in which denial of
leave to amend can be justified.  [Citation.]”  (Howard v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422.) 
Notwithstanding the “policy of great liberality in permitting amendments to the
complaint at any stage of the proceedings, up to and including trial
[citations], this policy should be applied only ‘where no prejudice is shown to
the adverse party . . . .’ [citation].  A different result is indicated
‘where inexcusable delay and probable prejudice to the opposing party’ is
shown. [Citation].”  (Magpali v.
Farmers Group (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 487.) 
 
A motion for leave to amend a pleading must also comply
with the procedural requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324,
which requires a supporting declaration to set forth explicitly what
allegations are to be added and where, and explicitly stating what new evidence
was discovered warranting the amendment and why the amendment was not made
earlier. The motion must also include (1) a copy of the proposed and numbered
amendment, (2) specifications by reference to pages and lines the allegations that
would be deleted and added, and (3) a declaration specifying the effect,
necessity and propriety of the amendments, date of discovery and reasons for
delay.  (See Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1324(a), (b).) 
 
Demurrer 
 
The grounds for a demurrer must
appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.¿
(Code Civ. Proc. § 430.30(a); Blank v.
Kirwan(1985) 39 Cal. 3d 311, 318.) A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Ibid.)¿ 
¿¿ 
A demurrer assumes the truth of all factual, material
allegations properly pled in the challenged pleading. (Blank v. Kirwan, supra, 39 Cal. 3d at p. 318.) No matter how
unlikely or improbable, the plaintiff’s allegations must be accepted as true
for the purpose of ruling on the demurrer. (Del
E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.¿ App. 3d 593,
604.) But this does not include contentions; deductions; conclusions of fact or
law alleged in the complaint; facts impossible in law; or allegations contrary
to facts of which a court may take judicial notice.¿ (Blank, supra, 39 Cal. 3d
at p. 318.)¿ 
¿¿ 
Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.10(e), the party against
whom a complaint has been filed may demur to the pleading on the grounds that
the pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
It is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer if there is a reasonable
probability that the defect can be cured by amendment. (Hahn v. Mirda, supra, 31 Cal. 4th at p. 745.)¿ 
 
Meet & Confer 
 
Prior to filing
a demurrer, the demurring party is required to satisfy their meet and confer
obligations pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc. (CCP) §430.41 and demonstrate that
they so satisfied their meet and confer obligation by submitting a declaration
pursuant to CCP §430.41(a)(2) & (3).¿This requirement also applies to
motions to strike. (CCP § 435.5.) Here, the parties sufficiently met and
conferred via conference call on September 28, 2023. (Clements Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.)
Therefore, the meet and confer requirement is met.¿ 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Motion for Leave to
File Third Amended Third Party Complaint
 
Trustees contend that the court should allow an the Amended
TPC because leave to amend is liberally granted, Defendants Peter, Aptco, and
Anna Marie will not be prejudiced by the amendment, and that the additional
proposed causes of action relate to the same set of core facts. Defendants
Peter, Aptco, and Anna Marie argue that the court should deny Trustees’ motion
because it still does not comply with CRC Rule 3,1324(b), their claims violate
the sham pleading doctrine, they are judicially estopped from now claiming the
Trust was a partner since the district court granted their motion to intervene
based on their position that Roy Biondi was a partner, and their claims are
still time-barred.[2]

 
Generally, following a sustained demurrer, an order granting
leave to amend only authorizes a party to replead and add the cause of action
that was subject to the order sustaining the demurrer. There is an exception to
this general rule. In Patrick v. Alacer
Corp. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 995, 1015 (Alacer),
the Court of Appeal found that the plaintiff’s adding a new cause of action to
a complaint after demurrer did not exceed the scope of leave to amend. There,
the new cause of action “directly respond[ed] to the [trial] court’s reasons
for sustaining the earlier demurrer” and while the plaintiff “may not have been
free to add any cause of action under the sun” the cause of action she did add
was allowable. (Id. at 1015.) The
similarities to the Trustees’ 3TPC with Alacer
are striking. First, the court granted leave to the Trustees to amend their
third-party complaint pertaining to the statute of limitations, fraud, and
fiduciary duty. (Order of Court’s Final Ruling, July 27, 2023.) The Trustees
filed a First Amended Third-Party Complaint on August 16, 2023 that added
factual allegations and causes of action. As in Alacer, where the new cause of action directly responded to the
articulated reasons for sustaining the demurrer, here, the new causes of action
served to bolster the Trustees’ claims for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and
problems with the statute of limitations. Accordingly upon closer look, and as Alacer provides, the Trustees have not
exceeded the scope of their granted leave post demurrer.[3]
As such, express permission to amend the complaint was not required because the
prior order gave moving party implicit permission under Alacer. 
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS Trustees’ motion for leave
to file a Third Amended Third Party Complaint and deems it filed as of today’s
date.
 
Demurrer[4]
 
Statute of Limitations
 
Moving Defendants contend that all of the Trustees’ claims
are time-barred because they accrued on April 7, 2013, when Roy Biondi died,
that the Trustees had a legal duty to protect and preserve the trust property
upon Mr. Biondi’s death, and any alleged transfer of the partnership interest to
the trust is a sham. The Trustees argue that Moving Defendants should be
estopped from arguing statute of limitations because they induced inaction by
false representation or false concealment. Additionally, the Trustees argue
that their claims accrued in 2021, not in 2013, and that the recorded options
do not defeat the delayed discovery rule because the Trustees had no duty to
continually monitor public recordings to see if the Pierotti’s accepted an
offer on the property.[5]
Finally, the Trustees argue that Roy Biondi’s death did not dissolve the
partnership because he had already transferred his partnership interest,
without objection, to the Roy Biondi Trust in 1998. Moving Defendants reiterate
their argument that such a transfer was legally ineffective, if it occurred,
and if it did, it violated the partnership agreement.[6]
 
a.     
Equitable
Estoppel or Equitable Tolling Precluding Limitations Defense
“Equitable estoppel does not extend a limitations period but
rather comes into play only after the limitations period has run and addresses
itself to the circumstances in which a party will be estopped from asserting
the statute of limitations as a defense to an admittedly untimely action
because his conduct has induced another into forbearing suit within the
applicable limitations period.” (Doheny
Park Terrace Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. Truck Ins Ins. Exchange (2005) 132
Cal.App.4th 1076, 1089 (Doheny Park)
[quoting Battuello v. Battuello
(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 842, 847-848.]; see also Lantzy v. Centex Homes (2003) 31 Cal.4th 363, 383; Doe v. Marten (2020) 39 Cal.App.5th
1022, 1028.) The doctrine of equitable estoppel is based on the principle “that
no man will be permitted to profit from his own wrongdoing in a court of
justice.” (Doheny Park, supra, at
1089.) The doctrine has four
elements: (1) the party to be estopped must be apprised of the facts; (2) they
must intend that their conduct shall be acted upon, or must so act that the
party asserting the estoppel had a right to believe it was so intended; (3) the
other party must be ignorant of the true state of facts; and (4) they must rely
upon the conduct to their injury. (Doe v.
Marten, supra, at 1028 [internal citations omitted].)  The requisite act or omission must involve a
misrepresentation or nondisclosure of a material fact bearing on the necessity
of bringing a timely suit. (Ibid.) Additionally,
it is enough that the defendant’s conduct induced the plaintiff to delay
commencement of an action. (Id. at
1029.) It is not necessary for the defendant to actively conceal or intend to
mislead the plaintiff for the doctrine to apply. (Id. at 1030.) Finally, unless the underlying facts are undisputed, the
existence of an estoppel is generally a question of fact. (Ibid.) 
 
Equitable tolling stops the limitations period from running
during the tolling event, begins to run again after the tolling event
concludes, and extends the deadline for suit by tacking the tolled period to
the limitations period. (Lantzy v. Centex
Homes (2003) 31 Cal.4th 363, 370-371.) A plaintiff must specifically plead
facts to support equitable tolling when a cause of action is time-barred on its
face. (Long v. Forty Niners Football Co.,
LLC (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 550, 555.) Equitable tolling may apply to
fraudulent concealment cases “to disarm a defendant who, by his own deception,
has caused a claim to become stale and a plaintiff dilatory.” (Regents of Univ. of Calif. v. Sup. Ct.
(Molloy) (1999) 20 Cal.4th 509, 533.) The tolling period is so long as the
plaintiff’s reliance on the misrepresentation is reasonable. (Grisham v. Philip Morris U.S.A., Inc.
(2007) 40 Cal.4th 623, 637-638.)
 
The difference between equitable estoppel and equitable
tolling is whether the plaintiff was aware of their claim during the statutory
period. In equitable estoppel claims, the plaintiff is lulled into inaction by
a defendant’s misrepresentations. (See Sagehorn
v. Engle (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 452, 460.) Equitable tolling, on the other
hand, applies when due to the defendant’s fraudulent conduct resulting in
concealing the operative facts that are the basis of the action, the plaintiff
failed to discover those operative facts, and due diligence by the plaintiff to
discovery those facts. (Id. at
460-461.)
 
Previously, the court found that Trustees failed to
sufficiently allege facts tolling the statute of limitations for every cause of
action due to induced inaction by fraudulent concealment or that the delayed
discovery rule applies. Now, upon reviewing the Third Amended Third-Party
Complaint (3TPC), the court agrees with the Trustees that they have directly
responded to the Court’s prior notice of deficiencies by significantly bolstering
the factual allegations. In sum, the court finds’ that Trustees have now sufficiently
alleged facts to establish a basis to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel or
equitable tolling to preclude Moving Defendants from asserting a limitations
defense. The 3TPC alleges that Roy Biondi created his Trust on June 11, 1998
and transferred all of his property to it. (3TPC ¶¶ 30, 32.) The 3TPC alleges
that the Trust “continued to contribute to the Property’s maintenance and taxes
for forty years, including after [Roy Biondi’s] death in 2013 at the request of
his Partners.” (3TPC ¶ 31, see also Exhibit C and Exhibit D attached to the
3TPC.)[7]
Roy Biondi updated the Trust in 2010 and reaffirmed his plan to hold all of his
property in the Trust. (3TPC ¶ 32.) Moving Defendants and Roy Biondi’s Partners
had actual knowledge that Roy Biondi transferred all of his property, including
his Partnership interest, to the Trust. (3TPC ¶¶ 30, 32.) Additionally, the
3TPC alleges that Defendants Peter and Anna Marie represented to the Trustees
that distributions would be forthcoming up until October 5, 2021 when Defendant
Peter indicated that he might take the position that the Trust’s interest in
the partnership had terminated. (3TPC ¶ 50.) Trustees did not have a copy of
the fully executed Partnership Agreement in October 2021. (3TPC, Exhibit I
[wherein Trustees request such a copy.]) At least on October 17, 2021, Trustees
still believed that the Trust would receive its proportionate share of the
Property. (3TPC, Exhibit I.) Taken in context and considering these factual
allegations as true on demurrer, the Trustees have sufficiently alleged that
the various limitations periods for their claims should be equitably estopped
or tolled.
 
Accordingly, the court OVERRULES the demurrer on statute
of limitations grounds.
 
Sixth Cause of
Action – Breach of Fiduciary Duty
 
Moving Defendants contend that this cause of action fails
because Defendants Peter, Aptco, and Anna-Marie did not owe a fiduciary duty to
the Trustees. Trustees argue that they alleged facts supporting a confidential
relationship whereby the Moving Defendants voluntarily accepted or assumed to
accept the confidence of Trustees. 
 
The elements of a cause of action for breach of fiduciary
duty are: (1) the existence of a fiduciary relationship, (2) its breach, and
(3) damage proximately caused by that breach.” (O’Neal v. Stanislaus County Employees’ Retirement Assn. (2017) 8
Cal.App.5th 1184, 1215.)  A fiduciary duty may be imposed by
law or undertaken by agreement. (GAB
Business Services, Inc. v. Lindsey & Newsom Claim Services, Inc. (2000)
83 Cal.App.4th 409, 416 [disapproved on other grounds by Reeves v. Hanlon (2004) 33 Cal.4th 1140.]) A confidential
relationship is a fiduciary duty undertaken by agreement whereby a person
voluntary assumes a position of trust and confidence. (Id. at p. 417.) Whether a confidential relationship exists is a
question of fact. (Id. at pp.
417-418.)
 
Previously,
the court found that there were no specific factual allegations to
support Trustees conclusory allegation that there was some “confidential
relationship” [8]
with Peter and Anna Marie,.Upon reviewing the 3TPC, the court agrees that Trustees sufficiently
alleged a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty.[9] Notably, the element at
issue is whether a fiduciary duty existed. First, Defendants Peter and Anna
Marie acted on behalf of the partnership and on behalf of Trustees numerous
times. (3TPC ¶¶ 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 47, 49, 50, 51,
and 54.) Second, Defendants Peter and Anna Marie had regular, routine
conversations with Trustees as to status on the Property sale and partnership
matters. (3TPC ¶¶ 42, 43, 45, 47, 49, 50.) 
 
Accordingly, the court OVERRULES the demurrer to the
Sixth Cause of Action, Seventh Cause of Action, and Eighth Cause of Action.
 
Second Cause of
Action – Fraud by Omission/Concealment
 
Moving Defendants contend this cause of action fails because
Defendants Peter, Aptco, and Anna-Marie did not owe a duty to disclose alleged
material facts to the Trustees and the Trustees failed to sufficiently plead
reliance.[10]
 
“The elements of fraud, which give rise to the tort action
for deceit, are (a) misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure);
(b) knowledge of falsity (or 'scienter'); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to
induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Lazar v. Superior Court¿(1996) 12
Cal.4th 631, 638.)¿ 
 
“In California, fraud must be pled specifically; general and
conclusory allegations do not suffice…this particularity requirements
necessitates pleading facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what
means the representations were tenders.” (Lazar,
supra, at p. 645; Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469; Perlas v. GMAC
Mort., LLC (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 429, 434 [requiring plaintiffs who claim
fraud against a corporation to allege the names of the persons who made the
misrepresentations, their authority to speak for the corporation, to whom they
spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was said or written.]) Fraud
allegations need not be liberally construed, general pleading of the legal
conclusion of fraud is insufficient, and every element of the cause of action
for fraud must be alleged fully, factually and specifically. (Wilhelm v. Pray, Price, Williams &
Russell (1986) 186 Cal. App. 3d 1324, 1331.)
 
“[T]he elements of an action for fraud and deceit based on a
concealment are: (1) the defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material
fact, (2) the defendant must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the
plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed
the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have
been unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of
the concealed or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or
suppression of the fact, he plaintiff must have sustained damage.” (Boschma v. Home Loan Center, Inc. (2011)
198 Cal.App.4th 230, 248.)   
 
Upon
reviewing the 3TPC, the court finds’ that Trustees have now sufficiently
pleaded a cause of action for fraud by omission/concealment. First, as
discussed above, duty has been sufficiently alleged. Second, the Trustees
allege that Defendants Anna Marie and Peter failed to disclose what Peter was
doing with the property, the sale of the property, the issuance of the options
on the Property, the ultimate price it sold for in 2017. (3TPC ¶¶ 113, 114.) Additionally,
Trustees allege that Defendants Anna Marie and Peter told Trustees that the
Property sold for $8,000,000 instead of $45,000,000. (3TPC ¶ 116.) Third,
Defendants Anna Marie and Peter knew the property sold for $45,000,000 and not
$8,000,000. (Ibid.) Fourth,
Defendants Anna Marie and Peter intended for Trustees to rely on the
misrepresentations because they made it appear that they sold the property in
an arms-length transaction and repeatedly assured Trustees that there would be
forthcoming distributions from the sale. (3TPC ¶¶ 50, 52, 116.) Fifth, the
Trustees justifiably relied on Defendants Peter and Anna Marie because they had
acted on behalf of the Partnership numerous times before and continued to
assure Trustees as late as 2021that their proportionate share of the partnership
would be forthcoming. (3TPC ¶¶ 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 47, 49, 50, 51,
and 54.) Finally, the Trustees allege financial damages from deprivation of
their share of proceeds from the Property sale. (3TPC ¶ 125.) As to Defendant
Aptco, Trustees sufficiently alleged an alter-ego theory. (3TPC ¶ 73.)
 
Accordingly, the court OVERRULES the demurrer to the
Second Cause of Action, Third Cause of Action, Fourth Cause of Action, and
Fifth Cause of Action.
 
Moving party offers no further argument as to the ninth
and tenth causes of action. Accordingly, the court OVERRULES the demurrer to
those causes of action as well. 
 
CONCLUSION:
