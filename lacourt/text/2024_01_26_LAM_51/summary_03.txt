And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted summary adjudication to the plaintiff, 1st Source Bank, on the first and second causes of action, which are for breach of lease and enforcement of guaranty, respectively. The judge has denied summary adjudication on the fourth and fifth causes of action, which are for account stated and open book account, respectively. The judge found that the plaintiff has met its initial burden to establish breach of lease and enforcement of guaranty, but the plaintiff has not met its initial burden to establish account stated and open book account. The judge also ruled that the parties had a valid guaranty and that the guarantor failed to perform under the guaranty.
