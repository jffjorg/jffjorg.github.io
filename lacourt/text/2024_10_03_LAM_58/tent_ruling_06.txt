Background
 
This action arises from
an alleged breach of a verbal contract between Plaintiff Craig B. Forbes
(“Plaintiff”) and Defendant Charlee Pitree (“Defendant”). Plaintiff filed his Complaint
on July 8, 2024, alleging three causes of action against Defendants Luis Benavides; SchoolsFirst Federal Credit Union; Charlee Pitre; and Does 1
to 10, inclusive: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of the implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealings; and (3) fraudulent misrepresentation. Plaintiff
served his Complaint on Defendant Charlee Pitre by personal service on July 12,
2024, and by mail on July 15, 2024. Plaintiff served his Complaint on
Defendants Benavides and SchoolsFirst Credit Union by mail on August 8, 2024.
 
Defendants SchoolsFirst
Credit Union and Luise Benavides filed an Answer on August 13, 2024. Defendant
Charles Pitre (“Defendant”) filed a separate Answer on September 6, 2024. 
 
On September 11, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant motion for an order to deem requests for admission (“RFA”)
admitted by Defendant. 
 
Discussion
 
Code of Civil Procedure, section
2033.280, subdivision (b) states that if a party to whom requests for
admissions is directed fails to serve a timely response, “[t]he requesting
party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” The
court must make this order “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests
for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion,
a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
Plaintiff testifies that Defendant
was served the RFA in person and by mail on July 15, 2024. (Declaration of
Craig Forbes, ¶ 3.) This date indicates the RFA was served concurrently with
the Complaint.
“A plaintiff may make requests for
admission by a party without leave of court at any time that is 10 days after
the service of the summons on, or appearance by, that party, whichever occurs
first.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.020, subd. (b).) In this case, Plaintiff
served the RFA prematurely, by serving it with the summons, without leave of
court. Because Plaintiff failed to follow the proper procedure for serving an
RFA, Defendant was not obligated to respond. Plaintiff can serve the RFA again
to cure this procedural defect.
Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem Requests
for Admissions as Admitted is DENIED.
