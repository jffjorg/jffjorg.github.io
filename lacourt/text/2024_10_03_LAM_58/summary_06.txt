And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies plaintiff Craig B. Forbes' motion to deem requests for admissions admitted by defendant Charlee Pitre. The motion was filed on September 11, 2024, and seeks an order deeming the requests for admission admitted. The judge finds that the plaintiff failed to follow the proper procedure for serving the requests for admission, which was served concurrently with the complaint. As a result, the defendant was not obligated to respond. The judge orders the plaintiff to cure the procedural defect by serving the requests for admission again. The motion is denied.
