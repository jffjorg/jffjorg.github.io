And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Serrano v. American Honda Motor Co. Plaintiff Mirna Serrano has filed a motion to compel the deposition of American Honda's person most qualified (PMQ) and to produce documents relevant to the case. The judge has granted the motion in part, ordering American Honda to produce its PMQ for deposition on certain matters and to produce responsive documents. However, the judge has denied the motion in part, finding that some of the matters for examination and document requests are too broad. The judge has also denied Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against American Honda. The parties are ordered to meet and confer regarding discovery motions and to identify a date for the deposition on or before November 8, 2024.
