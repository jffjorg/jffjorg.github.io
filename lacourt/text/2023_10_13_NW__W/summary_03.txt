And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Maribel Vasquez v. Sherman Pointe Inc. The defendant, Sherman Pointe Inc., had filed a motion to quash service of summons, arguing that the corporation was not properly served. The judge has denied the motion and ordered the defendant to file a responsive pleading within 30 days.

The judge found that the defendant corporation had an agent for service of process, Ritesh Desai, and that attempts were made to serve the agent during regular business hours. However, the agent was not available to accept service, and the process server was unable to complete the service. The judge concluded that the defendant corporation had effectively evaded service and that substitute service was appropriate.

The judge cited several California statutes and cases in support of the ruling, including C.C.P. Section 425.20(b), which authorizes substitute service of process in lieu of personal delivery. The judge also noted that the defendant had not disputed that the service was made on an adult over 18 years old at the agent's residence and that the service complied with the requirements of C.C.P. Section 425.20.
