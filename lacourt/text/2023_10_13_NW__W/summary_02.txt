And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, White Zuckerman Warsavsky Luna & Hunt, LLP, has filed a demurrer to the defendant's first amended cross-complaint, arguing that the first cause of action for breach of written contract is barred by the two-year statute of limitations for malpractice. The court agrees with the plaintiff that the defendant's allegations sound in malpractice and that the statute of limitations has run. The court also finds that the second cause of action for breach of oral agreement is invalid because an agreement affecting the statute of limitations to waive a claim must be in writing to be enforceable. As a result, the court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend.
