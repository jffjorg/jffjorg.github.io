BACKGROUND
 
This is a lemon law action. On August
29, 2022, Plaintiff Kristina Theard filed a complaint against Defendant Galpin
Jaguar Lincoln-Mercury Inc, dba Galpin Jaguar Van Nuys Land Rover Van Nuys and Jaguar
Land Rover North America, LLC for 1. Violation of Song-Beverly Act - Breach of
Express Warranty; 2. Violation of Song-Beverly Act - Breach of Implied Warranty;
and 3. Negligent Repair. Plaintiff alleges she leased a defective 2019 Land
Rover Range Rover. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for
Production Set One from Defendant Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC is
GRANTED, in part. 
 
discussion
 
Plaintiff Kristina Theard moves the court for an order compelling
further responses to Plaintiffs’ First Set of Requests for Production of
Documents Nos. 16, 18, 33-36, 37-41, and 45-46 on the grounds many of
Defendant’s responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents failed
to either agree to produce the documents or failed to properly object in a
manner required by the Code of Civil Procedure. Plaintiff further moves this
court for an order awarding sanctions in the amount of $3,820.00 against
Defendant Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC, and its attorneys of record
Turner Henningsen Wolf & Vandenburg, LLP. 
 
A motion to compel further responses to a demand for inspection or
production of documents (“RFP”) may be brought based on: (1) incomplete
statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive, or incomplete claims of
inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized objections. 
(CCP § 2031.310(c).) A motion to compel further production must set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
inspection demand. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(b)(1).) In Digital Music
News LLC v Superior Court (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 216 at 224, the Court
defined “good cause” as a showing that there “a disputed fact that is of
consequence in the action and the discovery sought will tend in reason to prove
or disprove that fact or lead to other evidence that will tend to prove or
disprove the fact.”  
 
Plaintiff argues Plaintiff’s requests (nos. 16, 18, 33-41, and
45-46) are highly relevant to Plaintiff’s underlying Song-Beverly Act claims as
they seek documents regarding Defendant’s warranty claims policy and
procedures; Dealership/Franchise agreement; technical service bulletins and
recalls issued for the vehicle; similar customer complaints and warranty
repairs for vehicles of the same make, model and year as Plaintiff’s; and
documents providing a key to interpret diagnostic, repair, and complaint codes
used by Defendant as they relate to issues with the Subject Vehicle. 

In opposition, Defendant argues Plaintiff has not met her initial
burden with respect to Requests for Production Nos. 33-36, 37-41 and 45-46. Defendant
also notes it has produced documents responsive to Plaintiff’s Request for
Production Nos. 33-36 related to Plaintiff’s alleged concerns as stated in her
Complaint. 
 
The following requests are at issue:  
 
REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION NO. 16: All of YOUR warranty claims policy and procedure manual(s)
from 2019 to the present.
 
REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION NO. 18: The operative Franchise Agreement, if any, on the date
of sale of the SUBJECT VEHICLE between YOU and the dealership that sold the
SUBJECT VEHICLE to Plaintiff.
 
REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION NO. 33: All Technical Service Bulletins which have been issued
for the same year, make, and model as the SUBJECT VEHICLE 
 
REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION NO. 34: All Recalls which have been issued for the same year,
make, and model as the SUBJECT VEHICLE.
 
REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION NO. 35: All Field Service Actions which have been issued for the
same year, make, and model as the SUBJECT VEHICLE.
 
REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION NO. 36: All Special Service Messages that have been issued for
the same year, make, and model as the SUBJECT VEHICLE.
 
REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION NO. 37: DOCUMENTS sufficient to identify all of YOUR OBDII codes
for the same year, make, and model as the SUBJECT VEHICLE.
 
REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION NO. 38: DOCUMENTS sufficient to show all of YOUR vehicle symptom
codes for the same year, make, and model as the SUBJECT VEHICLE.
 
REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION NO. 39: DOCUMENTS sufficient to show all of YOUR vehicle
component repair codes for the same year, make, and model as the SUBJECT
VEHICLE.
 
REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION NO. 40: DOCUMENTS sufficient to show all of YOUR customer
complaint codes from 2019 to present.
 
REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION NO. 41: DOCUMENTS sufficient to show all labor operation codes
provided by YOU to YOUR authorized dealerships from 2019 to present.
 
REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION NO. 45: All DOCUMENTS evidencing complaints by owners of 2019
Land Rover Range Rover Sport vehicles regarding any of the complaints that the
SUBJECT VEHICLE was presented to YOUR or YOUR authorized repair facilities for
repair during the warranty period. 
 
REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION NO. 46: All DOCUMENTS evidencing warranty repairs to 2019 Land
Rover Range Rover Sport vehicles regarding any of the components that YOU or
YOUR authorized repair facilities performed repairs on under warranty.
 
The court finds RPD Nos. 16, 18, 45, and 46 require further
response. These requests are relevant or could lead to the discovery of
relevant evidence in  support of Plaintiff’s
claimed violation of the Song-Beverly Act. 
No. 45, however, must be limited to complaints regarding vehicles of the
same make and model as Plaintiffs’ vehicle, as well as to the California
geographic area.  As for Request No. 46,
defendant is ordered to produce all documents evidencing repairs made in
California to a 2019 Land Rover Range Rover Sport Vehicle, while the vehicle
was under warranty, that are of same type of complaint made by plaintiff in
this case.    
 
The court finds RPD No. 37, 38, 39, 40, and 41 should be limited
to the defect alleged. Because these ask for “all” codes, rather than all codes
pertaining to electrical and transmission issues, the objection that the RFDs
are overly broad and seek irrelevant information is SUSTAINED.  The
request must be limited. 
 
Although Defendant contends they have provided supplemental
responses to 33-36, Plaintiff argues Requests Nos. 33-36 continue to refer
Plaintiff to a website which requires the payment of a fee to access these
documents. The court agrees such a response is insufficient. 
 
To the extent a document responsive is privileged, a privilege log
must be produced. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Requests for Production Set One from Defendant Jaguar Land Rover North America,
LLC is GRANTED in part.
 
Sanctions
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310 (h) provides for the
imposition of monetary sanctions against any party who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes such a motion unless the court finds that the one subject to sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of sanctions unjust. 
 
There being
substantial justification, with merit to both sides, the court denies the
requests for sanctions.
