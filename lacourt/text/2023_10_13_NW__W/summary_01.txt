And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production from the Defendant, Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC. The Plaintiff, Kristina Theard, is seeking documents related to the Defendant's warranty claims policy and procedures, dealership/franchise agreement, technical service bulletins and recalls, similar customer complaints and warranty repairs, and documents providing a key to interpret diagnostic, repair, and complaint codes.

The Judge grants the motion in part, ordering the Defendant to provide further responses to requests for production nos. 16, 18, 45, and 46. The Judge also orders the Defendant to produce documents evidencing complaints by owners of 2019 Land Rover Range Rover Sport vehicles regarding similar complaints and warranty repairs.

The Judge denies the Plaintiff's request for sanctions against the Defendant, finding that there is substantial justification for the Defendant's actions. The Judge also limits the scope of some of the requests for production and requires the Defendant to produce a privilege log for any documents that are privileged. The hearing is set for October 13, 2023, and the trial date is set for May 13, 2024.
