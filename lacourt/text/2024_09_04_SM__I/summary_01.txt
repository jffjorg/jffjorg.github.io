And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in a lawsuit filed by Flores, the trustee appointed by the Probate Court, against Sheets, who allegedly took money from an account held by the decedent at Citibank without authority. The judge has overruled the demurrer filed by Sheets, which challenged Flores' authority to sue. The judge found that the general assignment, which includes all certificates of deposit and money market accounts, encompasses the Citibank funds and makes them part of the trust. The judge also denied the motion to continue the trial, which was requested by Sheets due to the unavailability of a Citibank witness on the scheduled trial date. The judge allowed the witness to testify remotely, but it will be Sheets' burden to ensure that the witness has all necessary documents. The judge reminded the parties that the trial is expected to last less than a day and that they should provide three sets of exhibit binders and an exhibit list on the day of trial. Finally, the judge strongly urged the parties to settle the matter, as there is not much money at stake and a settlement would allow all parties to move on with certainty.
