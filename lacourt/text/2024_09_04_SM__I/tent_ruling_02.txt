 Case Number:  24SMCV00805    Hearing Date:   September 4, 2024    Dept:  I The demurrer is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.  The motion to strike is GRANTED. 
 
This is a negligence action filed by plaintiff against
various public and private entities including the demurring party, the City of
West Hollywood.  West Hollywood demurs to
the second and third causes of action for negligence and premises liability on
the ground that there are insufficient facts to support it.  In response, plaintiff clarified that it was
not bringing those causes of action against West Hollywood.  The court believes that the complaint is
ambiguous in that regard, but given plaintiff’s clarification, the best way to
deal with the problem is to sustain the demurrer without leave to amend to
clarify plaintiff’s stated position. 
West Hollywood does not demur to the first cause of action.  This probably could have been dealt with had
the parties engaged in a good faith and meaningful meet and confer process.
 
The motion to strike interest is based on Civil Code section
3291.  Defendant contends that interest
is not available as against a public entity pursuant to Civil Code section
3291, which does so state.  Because it
does not seem that plaintiff can overcome that statutory bar, the court is
inclined to DENY LEAVE TO AMEND. 
However, the court will inquire of plaintiff whether plaintiff believes
that if given leave to amend plaintiff could cure that problem.
