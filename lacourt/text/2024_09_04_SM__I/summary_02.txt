And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a negligence action filed by an unnamed plaintiff against the City of West Hollywood and other public and private entities. The City of West Hollywood demurred to the second and third causes of action, arguing that there is insufficient evidence to support them. The plaintiff clarified that it was not bringing those causes of action against the City of West Hollywood, but the court finds the complaint to be ambiguous on this point. As a result, the judge sustains the demurrer without leave to amend. The City of West Hollywood also moved to strike interest, citing Civil Code section 3291, which prohibits interest against public entities. The judge grants this motion. The judge will inquire of the plaintiff whether it believes that it can cure the problem by amending the complaint.
