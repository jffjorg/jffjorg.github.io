And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively granted the plaintiff's motion to vacate the conditional dismissal and enter judgment against the defendant. The parties had stipulated to a dismissal and request for retention of jurisdiction, with the agreement that the defendant's failure to comply with the terms of the settlement would result in a judgment against the defendant in the amount of $48,713.64 plus costs. The plaintiff asserts that the defendant has failed to make payments consistent with the agreement since June 2023 and has sent a "cure letter" to the defendant. The judge finds that the unopposed motion is granted and orders that judgment be entered in the amount of $36,000, with $563 in costs.
