On January 18, 2023, plaintiff American
Express National Bank (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendant Jenny
Sen (“Defendant”) asserting a single cause of action for common counts. On June
6, 2023, the parties stipulated to a dismissal and requested the Court retain
jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. In the
stipulation, the parties agreed that Defendant’s failure to comply with the
terms of the settlement agreement would result in a judgment against Defendant
in the amount of $48,713.64 plus costs, with a credit for any payments made
under the settlement agreement. (Stipulation, ¶ 5.) Defendant’s payment plan consisted
of one payment of $3,713.64 on or before March 28, 2023, with consecutive
monthly payments of $3,000 due on or before the 25th day of each and every
month beginning April 2023 through and including June 2023, followed by
consecutive payments of $9,000 each month, due on or before the 25th day of
each and every month from July 2023 through October 2023. (Stipulation, ¶ 6.) Failure
to have any payment delivered to a specific address within 5 days of the due date
shall be considered a default. (Id., ¶ 9.) In the event of a default,
Plaintiff may file a request to enter judgment after mailing written notice of
the default to Defendant; Defendant will have 14 days from the date of mailing
to cure the default. (Id., ¶ 12.) 
On October 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed
this motion to vacate the conditional dismissal and enter judgment pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. 
“If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.) 
Plaintiff’s counsel, Scott D. Dyle,
declares that Plaintiff has failed to make payments consistent with the
Agreement since June 26, 2023, and on October 3, 2023, his office sent a “cure
letter” to Defendant. (Dyle Decl., ¶ 7.) He states that he has reviewed the
records of Defendant’s account with his office and that Defendant has made
payments totaling $12,713.64, therefore, Plaintiff requests a judgment of
$36,000 with $563 in costs, which include the initial filing fee, service
costs, and $60 filing fee for this motion. 

In light of counsel’s declaration and
the terms of the settlement agreement, the unopposed motion to enter judgment
is GRANTED. 
Moving party to give notice.
Dated this 24th
day of January 2024
