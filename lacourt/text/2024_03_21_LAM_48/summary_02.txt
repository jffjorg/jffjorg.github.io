And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion of Jeffrey H. Reeves, counsel for Defendant Fuga, Inc., to be relieved as counsel. The motion was unopposed, but the court denied it without prejudice. The court noted that an attorney's request for withdrawal should be granted absent a showing of resulting prejudice, but Reeves did not provide a valid reason for withdrawal. Additionally, the court found that defendant would be prejudiced by Reeves' withdrawal due to the upcoming trial date, as a corporation cannot represent itself in court without an attorney. The motion is denied, and the parties must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit to the tentative ruling.
