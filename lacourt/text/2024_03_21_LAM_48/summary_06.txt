Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case filed by Alex Martinez against Prestige Consumer Healthcare Inc. The case alleges that the Defendant developed and marketed a product containing Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride without providing a clear and reasonable warning to consumers, in violation of Proposition 65. The Defendant filed a demurrer, arguing that the Plaintiff cannot prove an intentional exposure without a clear and reasonable warning because the product's label includes an FDA-required warning. The Judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that it is premature to make a fact-intensive finding of preemption at the pleading and demurrer stage. The case is set for a hearing on March 21, 2024.
