And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motions to compel further responses to Requests for Admissions and Form Interrogatories filed by Jamison Realty Advisors LLC, Jamison Services Inc., and Central Plaza LLC. The motions were filed in response to the plaintiff's failure to provide sufficient responses to the RFAs and Form Interrogatories.

The plaintiff had objected to the RFAs, claiming that they were vague and ambiguous and failed to provide sufficient context for the admission sought. However, the judge has overruled these objections, citing the principles of Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220, subdivision (c) and Grace v. Mansourian (2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 523, 529.

The judge has also ordered the plaintiff to provide supplemental responses to the RFAs and Form Interrogatories within 30 days. The judge has warned the parties that future failure to comply with discovery obligations may result in monetary sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 177.5.

The judge has scheduled a Non-Appearance Case Review Re: Payment of Additional Filing Fees for April 24, 2024 to review the payment of additional filing fees.
