And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel discovery as moot, since the plaintiff has now received the defendant's verified responses. The judge notes that the defendant claims to have served the responses on December 20, 2023, and that the plaintiff received them only after filing the motion. The judge does not find evidence to support the plaintiff's claim that the defendant deliberately ignored the plaintiff's requests for discovery responses.

Additionally, the judge has ordered the plaintiff to pay three additional filing fees within 10 days, and has scheduled a Non-Appearance Case Review for April 24, 2024, to review the payment of the additional fees. The judge has also warned the parties not to combine multiple motions into a single motion in the future, as this can cause inconvenience and inaccuracies in the court's scheduling.
