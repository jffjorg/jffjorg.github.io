[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY
  INJUNCTION
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
March 21, 2024



 
On January 24, 2024, Plaintiff
Ify Wimberly filed this action against Defendant Ricardo Sevilla for (1) quiet title,
(2) declaratory relief, (3) trespass, (4) private nuisance, and (5) injunctive relief.
On
February 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary injunction.
The
Court does not rule on Plaintiff’s objections to Defendant’s declaration because
Plaintiff did not meet her burden, so the Court did not rely on Defendant’s declaration.
LEGAL
STANDARD
“Trial
courts traditionally consider and weigh two factors in determining whether to issue
a preliminary injunction.  They are (1) how
likely it is that the moving party will prevail on the merits, and (2) the relative
harm the parties will suffer in the interim due to the issuance or nonissuance of
the injunction.”  (Dodge, Warren &
Peters Ins. Services, Inc. v. Riley (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 1414, 1420.)  “‘[T]he greater the . . . showing on one, the
less must be shown on the other to support an injunction.’”  (Ibid., quoting Butt v. State of California
(1992) 4 Cal.4th 668, 678.)
When
the effect of an injunction mandates a change in the parties’ relationship to one
another from the status quo at the time the action was filed, the injunction is
considered a mandatory injunction as opposed to a prohibitory one.  (Agricultural Labor Bd. v. Superior Court
(1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 709, 713.)  Preliminary
mandatory injunctions rarely are granted and are reserved for extreme cases where
the right is clearly established and irreparable injury will occur in the absence
of the injunction.  (Board of Supervisors
v. McMahon (1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 286, 295 (McMahon).)
The
burden of proof is on the moving party to show all elements necessary to support
issuance of a preliminary injunction.  (O’Connell
v. Superior Court (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1452, 1481.)  “‘Generally, the ruling on an application for
a preliminary injunction rests in the sound discretion of the trial court.  The exercise of that discretion will not be disturbed
on appeal absent a showing that it has been abused.’”  (Cohen v. Board of Supervisors (1985) 40
Cal.3d 277, 286.)
DISCUSSION
A.        Plaintiff Seeks a Mandatory Injunction.
Plaintiff
resides on property that is next to Defendant’s property.  (Wimberly Decl. ¶ 1.)  In November 2005, the parties entered into a written
agreement to allow Defendant to construct a fence wall on his property line.  (Wimberly Decl. ¶ 2.)  The wall was constructed in 2010.  (Wimberly Decl. ¶ 2.)  In 2014, Plaintiff did not object to Defendant
constructing another wall on his property line. 
(Wimberly Decl. ¶ 4.)  Plaintiff did
not know that the walls were on her property line until a boundary line survey in
July 2023.  (Wimberly Decl. ¶¶ 2, 8.)
Plaintiff
seeks to restrain Defendant from “using, trespassing and/or encroaching on certain
areas on Plaintiff’s real property commonly known as 1537 S. Dunsmuir Avenue, Los
Angeles, CA 90019-4033, and more particularly described as: Lot 25 in Block 4 of
Tract No. 4889, as per map recorded in Book 53, Page 15 of Maps in the Office of
the County Recorder.”
For
Defendant to comply with such an order, he would need to remove the two walls
on the property lines.  That order would alter,
rather than preserve, the status quo.  This
is therefore a mandatory injunction, which requires a showing of irreparable harm.  (McMahon, supra, 219 Cal.App.3d at p. 295.)
B.        Plaintiff Has Not Shown That She Will
Suffer Irreparable Harm Without an Injunction.
Plaintiff
argues that because this action involves unique real property, “any such injury
or loss constitutes irreparable harm . . . and [she] will suffer irreparable harm
from a continuing trespass on her real property.”  (Motion at p. 6.)  According to Plaintiff, “she cannot be properly
compensated in damages for the trespass, which is continuing, and she is being denied
the full use of The Property.”  (Ibid.)
Although
Plaintiff states that the walls “substantially interfere[] with and prevent[] [her]
from maximizing the use of [her] real estate,” Plaintiff did not know that the walls
were on her property line until in July 2023. 
(Wimberly Decl. ¶¶ 2, 8, 11.)  It was
only after Plaintiff started receiving inquiries to sell the property that she had
the survey done.  (Wimberly Decl. ¶¶ 5, 8.)  
The
walls were constructed in 2010 and 2014. 
(Wimberly Decl. ¶¶ 2-4.)  There is
no evidence that now, over a decade later, Plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm
in the absence of a mandatory injunction before a resolution of this action on the
merits.
CONCLUSION
The
motion for preliminary injunction is DENIED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
