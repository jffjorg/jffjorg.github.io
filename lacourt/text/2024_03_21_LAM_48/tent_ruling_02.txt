  CASE NO.: 20STCV04731
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
March 21, 2024



 
Jeffrey
H. Reeves, counsel of record for Defendant Fuga Inc., seeks to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration states only, “Our client
does not oppose us withdrawing as counsel.” 
No party opposed the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Here, however,
counsel has not provided a valid reason for withdrawal.  Additionally, with the upcoming June 24, 2024
trial date, Defendant would be prejudiced because “a corporation cannot represent
itself in a court of record either in propria persona or through an officer or agent
who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille,
Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  
The
motion is DENIED without prejudice.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
