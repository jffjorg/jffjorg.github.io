And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to substitute Stella K. Hui as the successor in interest of deceased defendant Grace Hsiao Hui. The plaintiff seeks to continue the action against the deceased defendant's estate, but has failed to comply with the requirements of Probate Code section 9370. The plaintiff has not filed a claim with the probate court and has not obtained an order to substitute the personal representative in the action. The judge has also noted that the motion's proof of service does not reflect service on Stella K. Hui. As a result, the motion is denied.
