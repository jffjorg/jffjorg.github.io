The Judge grants the Defendant's motion to strike portions of paragraphs 35, 43, 57, 69, and 79, which repeat allegations of malicious, fraudulent, and oppressive conduct. The Judge also grants the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages. The Judge finds that the Complaint does not allege sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages. The Judge orders the Defendant to give notice of the motion to strike and grants the parties 30 days to amend their pleadings. The Judge notes that a companion hearing (such as a Case Management Conference) may still be required.
