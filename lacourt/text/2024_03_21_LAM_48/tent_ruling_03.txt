[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO COMPLY
  WITH RECORDS SUBPOENA
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
March 21, 2024



 
On August 12, 2020, Plaintiffs
Jane Doe L.P. (a minor by and through her guardian ad litem Elizabeth P.) filed
this action against Downey Unified School District.
In
response to Form Interrogatories about injuries and the treaters for injuries,
Plaintiff alleged emotional distress, depression, and anxiety, which she sought
mental health treatment for.  (Evenstad
Decl. ¶ 4 & Ex. A.)
On
November 20, 2023, Plaintiff’s guardian ad litem executed a HIPAA Compliant
Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information Records to allow for
the release of Plaintiff L.P.’s records from Heredia Therapy Group.  (Evenstad Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. C.)
On
November 21, 2023, Defendant issued a deposition subpoena for the production of
business records to Heredia Therapy Group. 
(Evenstad Decl. ¶ 7 & Ex. D.) 
Plaintiff did not object or move to quash the Subpoena, but Heredia
Therapy Group objected to producing documents without a court order.  (Evenstad Decl. ¶¶ 7-8 & Ex. E.)
On
February 21, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to compel compliance with the
subpoena.  No oppositions were filed.
A
party may move to compel compliance with a subpoena for business records served
on a non-party.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1987.1,
2020.410.)
The
subpoena requests production of (1) all medical records and reports that pertain
to care and treatment, (2) all billing and payment records, and (3) all psychological
and/or psychiatric reports that are limited to depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders.  These records are relevant for Plaintiff’s allegations
of “severe emotional distress and injury in mind and body including, but not limited
to, physical injury, including fearfulness, mental anguish, anxiety, [and] sleeplessness.”  (Complaint ¶ 26; see Complaint ¶¶ 32, 39, 49,
60.)
The
unopposed motion to compel is GRANTED.  Heredia
Therapy Group is ordered to comply with the records subpoena within 21 days of this
order.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
