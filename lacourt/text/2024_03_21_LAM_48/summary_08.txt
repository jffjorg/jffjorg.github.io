And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, which sought to restrain the defendant from using, trespassing, and/or encroaching on certain areas of the plaintiff's real property. The plaintiff argues that the defendant's construction of a fence wall on his property line constitutes a trespass and that she will suffer irreparable harm if the walls are not removed. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff has not shown that she will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction, as she did not know that the walls were on her property line until a boundary line survey in July 2023, and the walls were constructed over a decade ago. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has not shown that she will be unable to recover damages for the alleged trespass. Therefore, the judge denies the motion for a preliminary injunction and requires the parties to notify the court if they intend to submit to the tentative ruling.
