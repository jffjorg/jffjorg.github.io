[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR APPROVAL
  OF PAGA SETTLEMENT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
March 21, 2024



 
On January 18, 2022, Plaintiff Eduardo
Zelaya filed this action against Defendants Akash General Partnership, Akash LLC
LLC, and Mohammad A. Siddiqui for penalties under the Private Attorney General Act
(“PAGA”).

The parties have agreed on the terms of a settlement.  Under the proposed settlement, Defendants will
pay a Gross Settlement Amount of $39,000.00. 
Of that amount, one-third will be paid as attorney fees ($13,000.00), up
to $1,491.00 will be paid as costs/expenses, and up to $3,150.00 will be paid to
a settlement administrator.  (Messrelian Decl.,
Ex. 1 [“Settlement”] at pp. 6-7.)  Of the
remaining amount, 75-percent will be paid to the Labor and Workforce Development
Agency (“LWDA”) and 25-percent will be paid to the aggrieved employees on a pro
rata basis.  
A court must review and approve any penalties sought as part of a proposed
settlement agreement pursuant to Labor Code section 2699.  (Lab. Code § 2699, subd. (l).)  “[C]ivil penalties recovered by aggrieved employees
shall be distributed as follows: 75 percent to the Labor and Workforce Development
Agency for enforcement of labor laws and education of employers and employees about
their rights and responsibilities under this code, to be continuously appropriated
to supplement and not supplant the funding to the agency for those purposes; and
25 percent to the aggrieved employees.”  (Lab.
Code, § 2699, subd. (i).) 
A.        Plaintiff Has Provided
Notice of the Settlement to LWDA.
A proposed PAGA settlement must be submitted to LWDA at the same time
that it is submitted to the court for review and approval.  (Lab. Code § 2699, subd. (l)(2).)  Plaintiff’s counsel attaches proof that the settlement
was submitted to the LWDA at the same time the motion was filed.  (Messrelian Decl. ¶ 26.)
Accordingly, the Court finds that this requirement is satisfied.
B.        The Settlement is Entitled to a Presumption
of Fairness.
A presumption of fairness¿for a settlement agreement exists where:
(1) the settlement is reached through arm’s-length bargaining; (2) investigation and discovery are
sufficient to allow counsel and the court to act intelligently; (3) counsel is experienced
in similar litigation; and (4) the percentage of objectors is small.  (Dunk v. Ford Motor Co.¿(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th
1794, 1802.)  The final factor does not apply
to PAGA.  (See Arias v. Superior Court
(2009) 46 Cal.4th 969, 984 [representative actions under PAGA do not violate the
due process rights of “nonparty aggrieved employees who are not given notice of,
and an opportunity to be heard”].)
In July 2022, the parties attended a full-day mediation session and
settled the matter a few days later.  (Messrelian
Decl. ¶ 9.)  The
settlement was therefore reached through arm’s-length bargaining.
The parties engaged in discovery regarding Defendants’ policies,
practices, operations, time and payroll information, Plaintiff’s personnel file
(including time and payroll data for Plaintiff), and the time records and payroll
records for aggrieved employees within the PAGA period.  (Messrelian Decl.
¶¶ 9-10.)  Accordingly, there was
sufficient investigation to allow counsel and the Court to act intelligently.
There is no specific information about counsel’s experience in
similar litigation.  (See Messrelian Decl. ¶ 23.)  However, the Court takes judicial notice of the fact that Plaintiff’s
counsel was also counsel of record in at least three other PAGA cases (Case Nos.
21STCV41387, 21STCV43225, 22STCV34375) in this Department.
The Court finds that the settlement is entitled to a presumption
of fairness.
C.        The
Release is Permissible.
If the Court approves the PAGA settlement, the aggrieved employees
will release “all claims for PAGA penalties that were alleged, or reasonably could
have been alleged, based on the PAGA Period facts stated in the Operative Complaint
and the PAGA Notices of the Plaintiffs.” 
(Settlement at p. 9.)
This release
is limited to claims for civil penalties that arise from or relate to allegations
in Plaintiff’s Complaint in this action, and it is permissible.
D.        The Attorney Fees and Costs Are Reasonable.
A prevailing employee is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney
fees and costs incurred in the action.  (Lab.
Code, § 2699, subd. (g)(1).)  Plaintiff’s
counsel will receive up to $13,000.00 in fees and up to $1,491.00 in costs and expenses
from the PAGA Settlement Amount.  (Messrelian
Decl. ¶ 24.)
The Court finds that the attorney fees and costs are reasonable.
E.        Conclusion
The motion for
approval of PAGA settlement is GRANTED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
