Plaintiff Zaw Tun (“Zaw Tun”)
(“Plaintiff”) moves to compel Defendant FCA US LLC (“FCA”) (“Defendant”) to comply
with this Court’s January 3, 2024, Discovery Order (“1/3/24 Ruling”).  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§2031.310, 2031.320.)
 
Background 
On
March 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed their operative complaint against Defendant
alleging five causes of action: (1) violation of Civil Code §1793.2(d); (2) violation
of Civil Code §1793.2(b); (3) violation of Civil Code §1793.2(a)(3); (4) breach
of express written warranty (Civ. Code §§1791.2(a), 1794); and (5) breach of
implied warranty of merchantability (Civ. Code §§1791.1, 1794).  (See Complaint.)
On
August 21, 2023, Plaintiff propounded written discovery on Defendant and
initially expected discovery responses by September 22, 2023.  (Decl. of Bedwan ¶8.)  On October 11, 2023, Plaintiff granted
Defendant an extension to serve its discovery responses by October 18, 2023.  (Decl. of Bedwan ¶9, Exh. 1.)  On October 24, 2023, Plaintiff emailed
Defendant asking when they could expect to receive the discovery responses, and
Defendant did not respond to this email. (Decl. of Bedwan ¶10, Exh. 2.)  On October 31, 2023, Plaintiff emailed
Defendant once more, following up on the responses.  (Decl. of Bedwan ¶11, Exh. 3.)  Defendant’s Counsel responded on October 31,
2023, stating that she would look into the responses and serve them soon.  (Decl. of Bedwan ¶12, Exh. 4.)  
On
November 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Compel Discovery Responses.  (Decl. of Bedwan ¶13.)  On December 19, 2023, Defendant served
non-code-compliant and deficient responses to Plaintiff’s Request for
Production and did not include document production.  (Decl. of Bedwan ¶14.)  On January 3, 2024, the Court heard
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Initial Discovery Responses and granted the motion
and ordered Defendant to produce code-compliant responses without objections
within 20 days.  (1/3/24 Minute Order.)
Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on February 2, 2024. 
On February 28, 2024, Defendant filed its opposition.  As of the date of this hearing no reply has
been filed.

as moot.
Plaintiff’s request for
sanctions is denied.
Moving Party to give notice.
