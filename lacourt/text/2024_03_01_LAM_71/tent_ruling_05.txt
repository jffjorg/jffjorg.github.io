amended complaint is overruled as to the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 17th, and
25th causes of action.
Defendants
Home Run Builders Inc.’s, Valley Vista 18 Project LLC’s, Shachar Shabtay’s,
Anette Sharvit’s, Shachar Sharvit’s, and Asaf Asi Azami’s motion to strike is

Defendants Home Run Builders Inc. (“HRB Inc.”), Valley Vista 18
Project LLC (“Valley 18 LLC”), Shachar Shabtay (“S. Shabtay”), Anette Sharvit
(“A. Sharvit”), Shachar Sharvit (“S. Sharvit”), and Asaf Asi Azami (“Azami”) (collectively
“HRB Defendants”) demur to Plaintiff 15907 Valley Vista LLC’s (“15907 Valley LLC”) (Plaintiff”) second amended
complaint (“SAC”).  (Notice of Demurrer, pgs. 1-2.)  HRB Defendants also move to strike portions of
the SAC.  (Notice of MTS, pg. 2.)
 
Background
Plaintiff filed its initial Complaint on March 28, 2023.  On June 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed its first
amended complaint (“FAC”).  On December
22, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative SAC against HRB Defendants, and
non-moving Defendants JDM Builders Inc. dba J D M Carpentry (“JDM Inc.”), David
Rocha Salgado (“Salgado”), DS Sheetmetal (“DS”); Edgard Windows & Doors Inc
(“Edgard Inc.”); Luzon Yossef, Inc. (“Luzon Inc.”), TJN Construction, Inc.
(“TJN Inc.”), and HC Builders, Inc., (“HC Inc.”), Jose De Jesus Rodriguez
(“Rodriguez”), and Stone Designs (“Stone”) (collectively, “Defendants”),
alleging twenty-five causes of action: (1) Violation of the Standards Set Forth
in Civil Code §§896 and 897 [against all Defendants]; (2) defective
construction [against all Defendants]; (3) fraud- intentional
misrepresentation [against HRB Defendants]; (4) fraud- intentional
concealment and nondisclosure [against HRB Defendants]; (5) Violation of
Civil Code §1102, et seq. [against 18 Valley Inc., HRB Inc., S. Shabtay, Azami,
and S. Sharvit]; (6) negligent misrepresentation [against 18 Valley Inc.,
HRB Inc., S. Shabtay, Azami, and S. Sharvit]; (7) breach of contract [against
18 Valley Inc.]; (8) breach of third-party beneficiary contract [against
HRB Inc.]; (9) breach of third-party beneficiary contract [against JDM
Inc.]; (10) breach of third-party beneficiary contract [against Salgado
and DS]; (11) breach of third-party beneficiary contract [against Edgard
Inc.]; (12) breach of third-party beneficiary contract [against Luzon
Inc.]; (13) breach of third-party beneficiary contract [against TJN Inc.];
(14) breach of third-party beneficiary contract [against HC Inc.]; (15)
breach of third-party beneficiary contract [against Rodriguez and Stone];
(16) breach of third-party beneficiary contract; (17) breach of express
warranty [against HRB Inc.]; (18) breach of express warranty [against
JDM Inc.]; (19) breach of express warranty [against Salgado and DS];
(20) breach of express warranty [against Edgard Inc.]; (21) breach of
express warranty [against Luzon Inc.]; (22) breach of express warranty [against
TJN Inc.]; (23) breach of express warranty [against HC Inc.]; (24)
breach of express warranty [against Rodriguez and Stone]; and (25)
breach of implied warranties [against all Defendants].
This action arises out of Plaintiff’s purchase of real property
located at 15907 Valley Vista Boulevard, Encino, CA 91436 (“Property”) from
Valley 18 LLC.  (SAC ¶3.)  Plaintiff and Valley 18 LLC entered into
the original California Residential Purchase Agreement (“RPA”) for the purchase
and sale of the Property for $8,995,000, which was amended as of November 8,
2021, by that certain Amendment by and among Plaintiff and Valley 18 LLC on or
about August 1, 2021.  (SAC ¶23.)  Plaintiff alleges it purchased the Property
on November 23, 2021.  (SAC ¶23; Exh. 9.)
On November 11, 2023, this Court heard argument on HRB Defendants’
demurrer and motion to strike Plaintiff’s FAC and took the matter under
submission.  On December 5, 2023, this
Court issued its ruling on the submitted matter, sustaining HRB Defendants’
demurrer to the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 17th, and 25th causes of action with 20
days leave to amend, and overruling the demurrer to the 5th cause of
action.  (12/5/23 Minute Order.)
On January 23, 2024, HRB Defendants filed the instant demurrer and
motion to strike.  On February 16, 2024,
Plaintiff filed its combined opposition. 
On February 23, 2024, HRB Defendants filed their consolidated reply.
 
A.  
Demurrer
Summary of Demurrer
HRB Defendants demur to Plaintiff’s 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 17th,
and 25th causes of action.  HRB
Defendants demur on the basis that Plaintiff’s 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 17th,
and 25th causes of action are improper because the Right to Repair Act
statutory scheme provides the sole remedy for these claims.  (Demurrer, pg. 3.)  HRB Defendants demur on the basis that Plaintiff’s
3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th causes of action are uncertain and inadequate pursuant
to C.C.P. §430.10(f) and fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause
of action against HRB Defendants pursuant to C.C.P. §430.10(e).[1]  (Demurrer, pg. 3.)
 
          Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring
party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer. 
(C.C.P. §430.41(a), emphasis added.) 
A declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the results of the
meet and confer process.  (C.C.P.
§430.41(a)(3).)
HRB Defendants’ counsel declares that on January 18, 2024, he made
a telephone call to Plaintiff’s counsel and left a voice mail message informing
of HRB’s effort to meet and confer regarding the SAC.  (Decl. of Windisch ¶2.)  HRB Defendants’ counsel declares that on
January 18, 2024, he also sent Plaintiff’s counsel an email correspondence
confirming the voice message regarding telephonic meet and confer as well as
attaching HRB’s formal written meet and confer correspondence outlining the
issues in the SAC.  (Decl. of Windisch ¶¶3-4,
Exhs. A-B.)  HRB’s Defendants’ counsel
declares that on January 19, 2024, he called and spoke with Plaintiff’s counsel
and discussed their meet and confer issued and parties were unable to come to
an agreement.  (Decl. of Windisch ¶6.)  HRB’s Defendants’ counsel’s declaration is
sufficient under C.C.P. §430.41(a).  Accordingly,
the Court will consider the instant demurrer.
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc.
(2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable.  (See Donabedian v.
Mercury Insurance Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a
demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to
judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their
contents].)  For purposes of ruling on a
demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true, but the
reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital District
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Right to Repair Act
HRB Defendants argue in McMillin Albany, LLC v. Superior Court,
the California Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether a homeowner can
bring causes of action other than violations of the Right to Repair Act against
a builder for construction defects.  (McMillin
Albany, LLC v. Superior Court (2018) 4 Cal.5th 241, 252-253.)  
For purchase agreements signed after 2002, the Right to Repair Act
specifies various statutory procedures that must be followed before a homeowner
may sue a builder for defects in construction of a new residential unit.  The statutes provide builders with the
absolute right to attempt a repair prior to a homeowner filing a lawsuit. The
purpose is to promote prelitigation repairs and avoid litigation costs that
result in increased costs of construction.  (Anders v. Superior Court (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th
579, 590.)
The Right to Repair Act applies only to construction defect
claims, not claims for breach of contract, fraud, or personal injury.  (McMillin Albany LLC, 4 Cal.5th at pg.
249.)  However, the Right to Repair Act
and its pre-lawsuit filing requirements do apply to any claim
relating to damages for residential construction deficiencies, not just to
those claims brought under the Right to Repair Act.  (Id. at pgs. 250, 257, 259 [stating Right
to Repair Act supplants common law construction defect or breach of contract
claims and failure to provide notice is ground to stay litigation]; Elliott
Homes, Inc. v. Superior Court (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 333, 341.)
Here, Plaintiff’s 2nd cause of action for defective construction
is a negligence claim, which can be alleged in the alternative, but is also subject
to the pre-lawsuit filing requirements of the Right to Repair Act.  Common law tort claims for personal injury,
such as negligence, are preserved.  (McMillin
Albany LLC, 4 Cal.5th at pg. 252.)  Plaintiff
amended the SAC to indicate that its allegation that HRB Defendants are
“builders” is limited to the 1st cause of action and made on “information and
belief.” (SAC ¶43.)  Further, Plaintiff alleges
that it has complied with all pre-litigation procedures.  (SAC ¶46).  Therefore, Defendants’ demurrer to the 2nd
cause of action on this basis is overruled.
HRB Defendants’ demurrer to the 17th and 25th causes of action on
the basis of the Right of Repair Act is not well taken.  The Right of Repair Act leaves undisturbed
causes of action for breach of contract, of which breach of implied and express
warranties are a species.  (McMillin
Albany LLC, 4 Cal.5th at pgs. 249, 253; Civ. Code §943(a).)  Plaintiff’s amendments in the SAC now clarify
that the damages sought pursuant to HRB’s breach of express warranty (17th
cause of action) are separate and distinct from those available under the Act’s
§944.  (SAC ¶146.)  The 17th cause cause of action now seeks only
those damages which are available pursuant to Civil Code §3300 for breach of
contract.  Those damages include (a) loss
of use and enjoyment of the Property, (b) consequential damages proximately
caused by the breach including the hundreds of hours of time expended by
Plaintiff to investigate and repair the defects, (c) mortgage interest
expenses, (d) real estate taxes, (e) Property maintenance expenses, and (f)
attorneys’ fees incurred to the extent they are recoverable as damages and not
costs.  None of these listed damages are
authorized under §944 of the Act and are therefore preserved based on their
exclusion from the statute’s text. 
Likewise, the 25th cause of action falls outside of the Act.  (State Farm General Insurance Co. v.
Oetiker, Inc. (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 940, 945-946.)
Plaintiff’s 3rd and 4th causes of action for fraud, and 6th cause
of action for negligent misrepresentation, a species of fraud or deceit, have
been amended such that they no longer include allegations that render their
precluded by the Act.  Plaintiff alleges
it fully complied or was excused from complying with the pre-litigation
procedures of the Act (SAC ¶¶26-32, 46) and clarify that Plaintiff is not seeking
any damages in these fraud causes of action which are also recoverable under
the Act §944 and seek only damages that are recoverable for fraud under Civil Code
§§3294, 3333 and 3343 (SAC ¶¶60, 69, 81).
HRB Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s 5th cause of action was
previously overruled.  (12/5/23 Minute
Order, pg. 5.)  Further, Plaintiff’s
allegations that it complied with the Act’s prelitigation procedures were
incorporated into the cause of action. 
(SAC ¶71; see ¶46.) 
Therefore, HRB Defendants’ demurrer to this cause of action is also
overruled.
Accordingly, HRB Defendants’ demurrer to the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th,
17th, and 25th causes of action on the basis they are preempted by the Right to
Repair Act is overruled.
 
Uncertainty
Fraud-
Misrepresentation, Fraudulent Concealment, & Violation of Civil Code §1102
(3rd, 4th, & 5th COAs)
A demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained only where the
complaint is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., he or she
cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what
counts or claims are directed against him or her.  (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)
If the complaint contains enough facts to apprise defendant of the
issues it is being asked to meet, failure to label each cause of action is not
ground for demurrer: “Although inconvenient, annoying and inconsiderate, the
lack of labels . . . does not substantially impair [defendant’s] ability to
understand the complaint.” (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986)
185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139 n.2.)
This Court already overruled HRB Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s
3rd, 4th, and 5th causes of action on the basis of uncertainty.
Accordingly, HRB Defendants’ demurrer to the 3rd, 4th, and 5th
causes of action on the basis of uncertainty is overruled.        
 
Conclusion
HRB Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s SAC is overruled as to the
2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 17th, and 25th causes of action.
Moving Party to give notice.
 
B.   
Motion to Strike
HRB
Defendants move to strike the following portions from Plaintiff’s SAC: (1) the
3rd cause of action, in its entirety (SAC 16:8-18:22); (2) the 4th cause of
action, in its entirety, (SAC 18:24-20:23); (3) the 5th cause of action, in its
entirety (SAC 20:25-21:16); and (4) the third Prayer for punitive damages (SAC 44:3-4).  (Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§435, 436.)
 
Legal
Standard
C.C.P. §436 provides that the Court
may, upon a motion made pursuant to C.C.P. §435, or at any time within its
discretion and upon terms it deems proper, “strike out any irrelevant, false,
or improper matter inserted in any pleading,” or any pleading or part thereof
“not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or
an order of the court.”  (C.C.P. §436.)
 
Punitive
Damages
Punitive
damages may be recovered upon a proper showing of malice, fraud, or oppression.
 (Civ. Code §3294(a).)  “Malice” is defined as conduct intended to
cause injury to a person or despicable conduct carried on with a willful and
conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others.  (Turman v. Turning Point of Central
California, Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.)  “Oppression” means despicable conduct
subjecting a person to cruel and unjust hardship, in conscious disregard of the
person’s rights.  (Id.)  “Fraud” is an intentional misrepresentation,
deceit, or concealment of a material fact known by defendant, with intent to
deprive a person of property, rights or otherwise cause injury.  (Id.)  Conclusory allegations, devoid of any factual
assertions, are insufficient to support a conclusion that parties acted with
oppression, fraud, or malice.  (Smith
v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1042.)
Plaintiff
alleges on information and belief the following:
[A]t all times during the Project,
Azami was the agent, servant, employee, representative, partner, joint
venturer, and/or alter ego of Seller, HRB, Shabtay, Sharvit, Anette and each of
them, and was at all times herein alleged authorized by them to speak on their
behalf. On or about September 9, 2021, September 29, 2021, and October 26,
2021, while at the Property prior to the close of escrow, Azami orally stated
and represented to the LLC Member(s)/Manager(s) that the house was water-tight,
well-constructed, structurally sound, and that all systems installed worked
properly. At or about the same time, Azami further stated and represented to
the LLC Member(s)/Manager(s), in substance: “If there are plumbing, structural,
waterproofing, building, or mechanical systems issues, we’re here for you.
We’re happy to take care of them. We’re happy to fix them. We’re happy to
correct them. If you ever have non-aesthetic problems, just call me and we’ll
correct it.” Upon inquiry by the LLC Member(s)/Manager(s), Azami further represented
that the Project was not constructed by an Owner-Builder, but, rather, a
separate General Contractor was used. On or about September 29, 2021, Azami
represented to the LLC’s Member(s)/Manager(s) that he was a licensed
contractor. All of these material representations were false and known by Azami
to be false when they were made, but they were relied upon by the LLC Member(s)/Manager(s),
who were ignorant of the true facts, to close escrow and complete the sale. In addition
to the representations made at the Property, Azami made some or all of these
representations in telephone calls with LLC Member(s)/Manager(s) that occurred
on, without limitation, October 19, 2021, October 20, 2021, November 3, 2021,
November 9, 2021, November 10, 2021, November 11, 2021, November 16, 2021,
and/or November 17, 2021.
 
The representations, and
each of them, made by Azami on behalf of himself, Seller, HRB, Shabtay, Anette
and Sharvit to Plaintiff’s Member(s)/Manager(s) alleged herein were false and were
known by said defendants to be false at the time Azami made said
misrepresentations. In truth and in fact, (i) the house was not water-tight,
well-constructed and/or structurally sound, (ii) systems installed did not work
properly, (iii) said defendants did not intend to repair defective conditions
that might exist, (iv) the Project was, in essence, constructed by an
Owner-Builder, not a separate General Contractor, and (v) Azami was not a
licensed contractor.
 
The
foregoing representations, and each of them, were made by Azami with the
intention of deceiving Plaintiff and inducing Plaintiff to close escrow and
pay the $8,995,000 sales price for the Property, all to
the benefit of Azami, Seller, HRB, Shabtay, Anette and Sharvit, and to the
detriment of Plaintiff.
 
Plaintiff, through its
member(s)/manager(s), actually and justifiably relied on Azami’s misrepresentations
because, among other things, Azami had superior knowledge of construction, generally,
and the construction of the Property and its improvements, specifically, and
Plaintiff was ignorant of the falsity of Azami’s representations.
 
In
reliance on said representations, Plaintiff, among other things, closed escrow
and paid the $8,995,000 sales price for the Property, which otherwise would
not have been paid. Had Plaintiff
known the true facts, Plaintiff would not have
closed escrow and purchased the Property.
 
(SAC
¶¶55-60.)
          Plaintiff sufficiently alleged that
said defendants, by and through their joint venturer, member, and agent Azami
were guilty of oppression, fraud, and malice, and ratified Azami’s fraudulent
conduct by, among other things, retaining the proceeds of sale.  (SAC ¶20.) 
Plaintiff sufficiently alleges fraud against the applicable Defendants.  Therefore, HRB Defendants’ motion to strike
Plaintiff’s request for punitive damages is denied.
 
          Conclusion
          HRB Defendants’ motion to strike is
denied.
Moving
Party to give notice.
