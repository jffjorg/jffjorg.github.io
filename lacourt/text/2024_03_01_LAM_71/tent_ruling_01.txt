 Hearing Date:  March 1, 2024



 
Plaintiff Nancy Valla’s unopposed
motion for reconsideration of this Court granting summary adjudication of
Plaintiff’s 9th and 10th causes of action and prayer for punitive damages is
denied.

 
Plaintiff Nancy
Valla (“Valla”) (“Plaintiff”) moves unopposed for this Court to
reconsider its ruling granting summary adjudication of the 9th and 10th causes
of action, and prayer for punitive damages. 
(Notice of Motion, pg. 1; C.C.P. §1008.)
 
Procedural Background
On August 12, 2020,
Plaintiff filed her initial complaint in the instant action against Defendants.  On December 5, 2022, Plaintiff filed the
operative FAC against Defendants alleging ten causes of action for (1) retaliation in violation of Labor Code §1102.5; (2) retaliation
and discrimination in violation of Health and Safety Code §1278.5; (3) retaliation
in violation of FEHA, Government Code §12940(h); (4) failure to engage in the
interactive process in violation of FEHA, Government Code §12940(n); (5)
failure to accommodate disability in violation of FEHA, Government Code §12940(m)(1);
(6) disability discrimination in violation of FEHA, Government Code §12940(a);
(7) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (8) failure to prevent
discrimination in violation of FEHA, Government Code §12940(k); (9) wrongful
termination in violation of public policy; and (10) wrongful termination in
violation of FEHA.  (See FAC.)  
The Court heard argument
on the motion for summary judgment on November 21, 2023, and took the matter
under submission.  On December 18, 2023,
the Court issued its ruling on a submitted matter, denying Defendants’ motion
for summary judgment, and denying Defendants’ motion in the alternative for
summary adjudication as to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th causes of
action, and granting as to the 9th and 10th causes of action and as to Plaintiff’s
prayer for punitive damages.  (12/18/23
Minute Order.)
Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on December 29, 2023. 
As of the date of this hearing no opposition has been filed.
 
Legal
Standard
C.C.P.
§1008(a) “requires that a motion for reconsideration be based on new or
different facts, circumstances, or law. A party seeking reconsideration also
must provide a satisfactory explanation for the failure to produce the evidence
at an earlier time.”  (See C.C.P.
§1008(a); New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th
206, 212.)
Any
party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the party of
written notice of entry of the order, file a motion for reconsideration.  (See C.C.P. §1008(a).)
Whether
“new” facts alleged are sufficient to satisfy the requirements of CCP § 1008(b)
is a question confided to the sound discretion of the trial court, with which
the appellate court will not interfere absent an obvious showing of abuse. (Graham
v. Hansen (1982) 128 Cal. App. 3d 965, 971.)
 

Discussion
          As
a preliminary matter, the Court will consider Plaintiff’s motion in light of
the fact Defendants’ counsel was directed to provide notice to Plaintiff of the
Court’s ruling on the 12/18/23 Minute Order and did not appear to do so.  (See Decl. of Grau ¶5 [“To date,
Plaintiff has yet to receive written notice of said order but learned of the
decision by checking the Court’s website.”].)
          Plaintiff’s
counsel declares Plaintiff submitted her opposition to the motion for summary
judgment on November 7, 2023.  (Decl. of
Grau ¶3.)  Plaintiff’s counsel declares on
information and belief that the deposition of Denise Livingston (“Livingston”)
was conducted on November 10, 2023. 
(Decl. of Grau ¶6, Exh. A.) 
Plaintiff’s counsel declares on information and belief that Carolyn
Caldwell’s (“Caldwell”) deposition was conducted on November 1, 2023.  (Decl. of Grau ¶7, Exh. B.)  
Plaintiff’s
counsel declares that in both Livingston’s and Caldwell’s deposition
transcripts are new facts that were not previously included in Plaintiff’s
Opposition to Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment or in the alternative,
Motion for Summary Adjudication, such as the fact that Livingston did not draft
any of the letters she personally signed and sent to Plaintiff, nor did she
participate in the process to determine any of the information being conveyed
in any of the letters.  (Decl. of Grau
¶8.)  Plaintiff’s counsel declares Livingston
also testified that she did not draft any of the letters that were sent out,
but that they were in fact drafted by Katherine Wargnier, the same individual
who worked with Caldwell to “embellish the reasons” as to how Plaintiff’s
reinstatement would cause substantial grievous economic injury to Dignity
Health.  (Decl. of Grau ¶8.)
          Plaintiff’s
counsel declares Livingston’s testimony also revealed that although she sent
Plaintiff letters about designating Plaintiff as a “key employee” and what
consequences would occur if Plaintiff were to not be able to return by August
1, 2019, Livingston was not a part of the discussions to make those decisions.  (Decl. of Grau ¶9.)
          Plaintiff’s
counsel declares Caldwell’s second deposition revealed that Dignity Health
chose the dates of return that were being demanded of Plaintiff in these
letters not because it would cause substantial economic harm to the hospital,
but because that was when Plaintiff’s twelve weeks of FMLA would have been
exhausted, removing Plaintiff’s job protection and allowing Dignity Health to
replace her position.  (Decl. of Grau
¶10.)
          The
Court declines to grant Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration despite the
evidence offered by Plaintiff in the deposition testimonies referenced in
counsel’s affidavit.  Plaintiff conceded her
argument on the 10th cause of action and prayer for punitive damages by not
addressing Defendants’ arguments in her opposition.  (See 12/18/23 Minute Order, pg.
17.)  Further, Plaintiff conceded at the
hearing on the motion that her employment was not terminated, which undercuts
an essential element of a cause of action for wrongful termination in violation
of public policy, the 9th cause of action. 
(See id.)
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration is denied.
Moving Party to give notice.
