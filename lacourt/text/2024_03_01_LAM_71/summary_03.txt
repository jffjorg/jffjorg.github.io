And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Zaw Tun's motion to compel Defendant FCA US LLC's compliance with the Court's January 3, 2024, Ruling as moot, as Defendant has since served verified responses to written discovery on February 21, 2024. The Judge also denies Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, as the Court's ruling on the motion renders the request unnecessary and Plaintiff failed to properly notice its request for sanctions in their notice of motion.
