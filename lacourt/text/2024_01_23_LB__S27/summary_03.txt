And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting summary judgment to the defendant in a medical malpractice and wrongful death case. The plaintiff, Claudia Lankford, filed the action against the defendant, Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, and its medical staff, alleging that their care and treatment of the decedent, Valentina Timascu, were negligent and caused her death. The defendant moved for summary judgment, arguing that it complied with the standard of care at all times and that its actions did not cause or contribute to the decedent's death. The judge found that the defendant's expert declaration was sufficient to meet its moving burden, while the plaintiff's expert declaration was deficient and objected to. As a result, the judge concluded that the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of material fact concerning breach of the standard of care and causation. The judge's ruling is subject to change based on any submissions the parties may make.
