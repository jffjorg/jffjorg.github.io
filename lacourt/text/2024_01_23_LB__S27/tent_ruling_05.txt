 Case Number:  23LBCV00824    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.    
12/12/23 Hearing
The Court was originally scheduled to hear this motion on
12/12/23.  Prior to the hearing, the Court
issued the following tentative ruling, which was ultimately adopted after
hearing:
Plaintiff, Sandra Morris
filed this action against Defendants, Blythe/Windsor Country Park Healthcare
Center, LLC, S&F Management Company, LLC, Estegenet Ayele, M.D., and
MemorialCare Medical Group on 5/05/23 for elder abuse and neglect, violation of
HSC §1430(b), negligence, and wrongful death. 
Plaintiff filed proof of service of the summons and complaint on Blythe,
S&F, and MemorialCare on 8/17/23.    
 
On 8/21/23, Plaintiff filed this motion for order for filing complaint
for damages nunc pro tunc, setting it for hearing on 2/27/24.  Plaintiff filed proof of service of the moving
papers on the agents for service of process on S&F, Blythe, and
MemorialCare.  Plaintiff did not file
proof of service of the moving papers on Ayele. 
Notably, Ayele is the only defendant who has filed an answer to date;
Ayele did so on 9/11/23.  Plaintiff
dismissed MemorialCare on 9/11/23.    
 
On 10/05/23, the Court held a Case Management Conference.  Plaintiff appeared through Counsel, Kyle
Schneberg.  Ayele appeared through
Counsel, Sara M. Greco.  The two
remaining entity defendants, S&F and Blythe, did not appear.  The Court advanced the hearing on the 2/27/24
motion to today’s date, 12/21/23.  The Court
ordered Plaintiff to give notice of the ruling. 

 
To date, there is no notice of the ruling in the Court’s file.  There is also no opposition to the
motion.  This is concerning, because
Ayele filed a demand that defense of statute of limitations be tried separately,
and this motion concerns the statute of limitations.  
 
The Court is continuing the hearing on the motion for one month, to Tuesday,
1/23/24.  Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice that the hearing on the motion is continued.  
 
2.     Continued
Hearing
Plaintiff appeared at the 12/12/23
hearing through her attorney.  Defendant,
Ayele appeared at the hearing through her attorney, Robert Fessinger.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court
ordered Plaintiff to give notice of the continuance.  
 
On 12/21/23, Plaintiff filed a
notice of ruling.  The notice of ruling
indicates, in pertinent part, “The Status Conference RE Bankruptcy Status
and/or Default of Defendants BLYTHE/WINDSOR COUNTRY PARK HEALTHCARE CENTER,
LLC; S&F MANAGEMENT COMPANY LLC, is scheduled for February 14, 2024…”
The Court has reviewed its online
docket, and finds there has never been a notice of bankruptcy stay filed in
this case.  CRC 3.650 required the
debtors to “immediately” serve and file notice when the stay was initiated.  However, pursuant to 11 USC §362(a), the stay
arises automatically, with or without a court order activating the stay.  Pursuant to §362(a)(1), all pending actions against
a bankruptcy debtor are stayed pending completion of bankruptcy
proceedings.   
 
The Court finds it cannot make any
order that would affect the proceedings against the debtors while there are
ongoing bankruptcy proceedings.  The hearing
on this motion is therefore continued to 2/14/24, to be heard concurrently with
the status conference re: bankruptcy and/or default.  
 
If Plaintiff wishes to have a substantive
ruling on this motion on 2/14/24, Plaintiff must file a declaration and/or
points and authorities concerning the status and effect of Defendants’
bankruptcy proceedings at least seven court days prior to the hearing.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice.  
 
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative as
directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department
does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the
tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed
off calendar.  If a party submits on
the tentative, the party’s email must include the case number and must identify
the party submitting on the tentative. If any party does not submit on the
tentative, the party should make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing
on this matter.
