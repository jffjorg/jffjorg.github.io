Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) filed by the defendants. The Judge finds that the defendants failed to meet their burden to show that disposing of hazardous waste is not an ultrahazardous activity, and therefore overrules the demurrer. The Judge also finds that the defendants failed to allege any ultimate facts showing alter ego liability, and sustains the demurrer to the claims alleging alter ego liability. The Judge grants leave to amend the SAC to permit Plaintiffs to add emotional distress allegations to their first cause of action for negligence, and sustains the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress. The Judge overrules the demurrer to the fifth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The Judge orders the Plaintiffs to file a Third Amended Complaint within 20 days and the defendants to file a responsive pleading within the statutory time thereafter.
