And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion filed by the plaintiff, Sandra Morris, to determine the statute of limitations for her lawsuit against several defendants, including Blythe/Windsor Country Park Healthcare Center, LLC, S&F Management Company, LLC, Estegenet Ayele, M.D., and MemorialCare Medical Group. The plaintiff is seeking to file a complaint for damages nunc pro tunc, which would allow her to file the complaint at a later date.

The judge notes that Ayele is the only defendant who has filed an answer to the complaint, and that MemorialCare has been dismissed. The judge also notes that there is no opposition to the motion, and that the plaintiff did not file proof of service of the moving papers on Ayele.

The judge has continued the hearing on the motion to January 23, 2024, to be heard concurrently with a status conference regarding bankruptcy and/or default. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to give notice of the continued hearing.

The judge also notes that the parties must file a declaration and/or points and authorities concerning the status and effect of the defendants' bankruptcy proceedings at least seven court days prior to the hearing if they wish to have a substantive ruling on the motion.
