The summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the demurrer filed by Defendants, Kyaw Moe, M.D. and Julio C. Romero, M.D. to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Plaintiff, Dana P. McCovery. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the FAC to state a cause of action and argues that Plaintiff lacks standing to pursue the claim.

The Court finds that the FAC is deficient in that it does not allege that Defendants' acts violated the standard of care applicable to medical providers. The demurrer is sustained with leave to amend, and Plaintiff is required to file a Second Amended Complaint and a declaration or affidavit showing standing within twenty days.

The Court also finds that Plaintiff's failure to provide the required declaration or affidavit and her continued failure to address the standing issue in her opposition to the demurrer warrant sustaining the demurrer on this ground.

The parties are ordered to meet and confer to agree on the filing of an affidavit or declaration in satisfaction of CCP §377.32 if Plaintiff wishes to pursue the causes of action for malpractice and/or negligence.
