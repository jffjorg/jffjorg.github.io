Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by the City of Los Angeles. The plaintiff, Demoni Henderson, filed a complaint alleging a trip and fall on an unmarked bench. The City of Los Angeles demurred to the complaint, arguing that it is insufficient to state a claim against the City, and moved to strike a specific paragraph alleging that a governmental employee created the dangerous condition. The judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, requiring the plaintiff to file an amended complaint within twenty days. The motion to strike has been denied. The judge has also ordered the plaintiff to file an amended complaint and the defendant to file a responsive pleading within the statutory time thereafter.
