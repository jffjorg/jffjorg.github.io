of Possession After Hearing is GRANTED
as to
Defendants
Mario Angulo and Heidy V. Roldan aka Heidy Roldan, with no bond.
Background     
Plaintiff Ally Bank (“Plaintiff”)
alleges as follows:
Prior to the commencement of this action,
pursuant to an assignment in writing, Plaintiff became and now is the owner of
a written contract (the “Contract”), pursuant to which Defendants Mario Angulo
(“Angulo”) and Heidy v. Roldan aka Heidy Roldan (“Roldan”) (collectively
“Defendants”), purchased from Plaintiff’s assignor a 2019 Dodge Hellcat, VIN
No. 2C3CDXL97KH571704 (the “subject vehicle”). (Complaint, ¶ 6.) The complaint
alleges that Defendants agreed to timely pay all amounts due under the Contract
yet have failed to make payments owed under the Contract. (Id., ¶ 8.) The
complaint alleges that Defendants currently owe Plaintiff the sum of $75,128.29
pursuant to the Contract. (Id.)   

 
On June 27,
2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting causes of action against Defendants
and Does 1-10 for:
 
1.              
Claim & Delivery of Personal Property 
2.              
Money on a Contract
 
Plaintiff
applied for a writ of possession in which Plaintiff seeks to recover the
subject vehicle from Defendants. Plaintiff applied for separate writs of
possession as to Defendant Angulo and Defendant Roldan. The Court will address
both writs of possession in this one ruling. 
 
A Case
Management Conference is set for November 30, 2023.
  
Discussion 
Plaintiff applies for a writ of possession
after hearing pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure 
sections 512.010.  Plaintiff seeks to recover the 2019 Dodge
Charger Hellcat, 
VIN #2C3CDXL97KH571704
(the “subject vehicle”) now in the possession of Defendants.
 
“Claim and
delivery is a remedy by which a party with a superior right to a specific item
of personal property (created, most commonly, by a contractual lien) may
recover possession of that specific property before judgment.” (Waffer Internat. Corp. v. Khorsandi
(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 1261, 1271.)
Procedural Considerations: No writ of possession may issue,
except after a hearing on a noticed motion (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.020, subd. (a))
or by ex parte application satisfying the conditions of section 512.020,
subdivision (b).  Prior to the section 512.020
hearing, the defendant must be served with all of the following: (a) A copy of
the summons and complaint; (b) A Notice of Application and Hearing; (c) A copy
of the application and any affidavit in support thereof. (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.030,
subd. (a).) “If the defendant has not appeared in the action, and a writ, notice, order,
or other paper is required to be personally served on the defendant under this
title, service shall be made in the same manner as a summons is served under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 413.10) of Title 5.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 512.030, subd. (b).)  Substitute
service of summons and complaint may be effectuated where personal service
cannot be accomplished with reasonable diligence. (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20,
subd. (b).)
The "Notice of Application
and Hearing" must inform the defendant of all of the following: (a) A
hearing will be held at a place and at a time, to be specified in the notice,
on plaintiff's application for a writ of possession; (b) The writ will be
issued if the court finds that the plaintiff's claim is probably (not actually)
valid and the other requirements for issuing the writ are established; (c) If
the defendant desires to oppose the issuance of the writ, he must file with the
court either an affidavit providing evidence sufficient to defeat the
plaintiff's right to issuance of the writ or an undertaking to stay the
delivery of the property in accordance with section 515.020; (d) The notice
must contain the following statement: “If you believe the plaintiff may not be
entitled to possession of the property claimed, you may wish to seek the advice
of an attorney. Such attorney should be consulted promptly so that he may
assist you before the time set for the hearing.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.040.)
On August 10, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a proof of service, which reflected that Defendant Roldan was served by
substituted served on July 26, 2023 with, inter alia, the summons,
complaint, Notice of Application for Writ of Possession and Hearing,
Application for Writ of Possession, and Memorandum of Points and Authorities. A
declaration of due diligence is attached to the proof of service showing four
attempts to personally serve Defendant Roldan.
On August 23, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a proof of service, which reflected that Defendant Angulo was
served by substituted served on July 26, 2023 with, inter alia, the
summons, complaint, Notice of Application for Writ of Possession and Hearing,
Application for Writ of Possession, and Memorandum of Points and Authorities. A
declaration of due diligence is attached to the proof of service showing four
attempts to personally serve Defendant Angulo.
The court determines
that adequate notice was provided to Defendant Roldan and Defendant Angulo.
MERITS: As for
the merits of the application, the court must make its determinations upon the
basis of the pleadings and other papers in the record; but, upon good cause
shown, the court may receive and consider additional evidence and authority
produced at the hearing or may continue the hearing for the production of such
additional evidence, oral or documentary, or the filing of other affidavits or
points and authorities. (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.050.) The court must issue writ
of possession if the plaintiff establishes “the probable validity of his claim”
to possession of the property and the undertaking requirements of section 515.010
are satisfied. (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.060; RCA
Service Co. v. Superior Court (1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 1, 3.) “Probable
validity” exists where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will
obtain a judgment against the defendant on that claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 511.090;
RCA Service Co., supra, 137
Cal.App.3d at 3.)
Probable
validity, in this case, has been established pursuant to the applications,
which are 
executed under
penalty of perjury by Plaintiff’s Authorized Representative James Singleton 
(“Singleton”) and
the exhibits attached thereto.[1] Singleton
attests, and/or the relevant documents 
reflect the
following: Plaintiff owns the Contract pursuant to an assignment and the
subject 
vehicle was
purchased pursuant to the Contract. (Singleton Decl., ¶ 5 and Exhibit A.)
Plaintiff 
has the right to
immediate possession of the subject vehicle pursuant to the Contract. 
(Id., ¶ 5
and Exhibit B.) 
 
Defendants have defaulted on the Contract as they have
failed to make the payment becoming 
due on October
14, 2022, in the amount of $1,463.09, or any of the regular monthly payments of
$1,463.09 due
thereafter. (Id., ¶ 6.) Singleton attests that Plaintiff has made demand
upon 
Defendants for
the surrender of possession of the subject vehicle but Defendants have failed
to 
surrender the
subject vehicle to Plaintiff. (Id.) As of June 15, 2023, there is an
unpaid balance,
due and owed to
Plaintiff, pursuant to the Contract in the amount of $75,128.29, together with 
other charges as
provided in the Contract. (Id.) 
 
Singleton declares that the average wholesale
and resale values of the subject vehicle are in the 
sum of $51,400.00 and $56,250.00,
respectively. (Id., ¶ 7 and Exhibit D.) It is 
believed that Defendants are concealing
possession of the subject vehicle from Plaintiff. 
(Id., ¶ 8.) Singleton has no knowledge
of the subject vehicle being taken on account of tax,
assessment, fine, or being seized under an
execution or an attachment against Plaintiff’s
property. (Id., ¶ 9.) The subject
vehicle is believed to be currently located at 7101 Rosecrans 
Avenue, Space 67, Paramount, CA 90723 or
16519 Holton Street, La Puente, CA 91744. 
(Id., ¶ 10.) 
 
Undertaking: A
bond must be posted as part of the undertaking unless the court finds that the
defendant has no interest in the property. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 515.010, subd. (b).) The undertaking must be in an
amount equal to twice the value of the defendant's interest in the property
(market value less all liens, etc.).  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 515.010.) Defendant’s interest is based on the market value of
the property less (1) any amount due and owing on any conditional sales
contract or security agreement, (2) all liens and encumbrances on the property,
and (3) any other factors to determine the defendant’s interest in the
property.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 515.010,
subd. (a).)
 
The applications are granted, with no bond. The court
determines that, since the balance owed is substantially more than the fair
market value of the Collateral, Defendants have no interest in same, and
therefore Plaintiff is not required to post an undertaking.
