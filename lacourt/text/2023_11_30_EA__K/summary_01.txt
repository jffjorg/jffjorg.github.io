  - "The anti-SLAPP protection for petitioning activities applies not only to the filing of lawsuits, but extends to conduct that relates to such litigation, including statements made in connection with or in preparation of litigation."
  - "The court finds that Cross-Defendants have made a threshold showing that the challenged causes of action arise from protected activity."
  - "The court will now proceed with the second step of the anti-SLAPP analysis (i.e., whether plaintiffs have established a probability of prevailing)."
  - "Given that Cross-Complainants have failed to oppose the motion, there is an inference that the motion has merit."

English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a special motion to strike filed by Cross-Defendants Shengdong Zhao, Zexing Zhao, Wanda Moving, Inc. and 2Cube Global, Inc. The motion was filed in response to a cross-complaint filed by Cross-Complainants alleging that Cross-Defendants stole goods belonging to them. The judge finds that Cross-Defendants have made a threshold showing that the challenged causes of action arise from protected activity, as defined by the anti-SLAPP statute. As a result, the judge grants the special motion to strike and dismisses the cross-complaint. The judge also denies Cross-Defendants' request for attorneys' fees and costs, as they did not request such relief in their notice of motion.
