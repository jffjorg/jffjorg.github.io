And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants Plaintiff Ally Bank's application for a writ of possession after hearing as to Defendants Mario Angulo and Heidy V. Roldan aka Heidy Roldan, with no bond. The writ is granted due to the probable validity of Plaintiff's claim to possession of the 2019 Dodge Hellcat, which was purchased by Defendants under a contract. The court finds that Defendants have failed to make payments owed under the contract and have defaulted on the contract. The court also finds that the balance owed is substantially more than the fair market value of the collateral, which means that Defendants have no interest in the subject vehicle and therefore Plaintiff is not required to post an undertaking. The writ will allow Plaintiff to recover possession of the subject vehicle from Defendants.
