And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Min Zhou to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Juan Zhao. The judge has sustained Min Zhou's demurrer in part, without leave to amend, as to the fifth cause of action (breach of written contract). The judge has also overruled Min Zhou's demurrer as to the first cause of action (fraud).

The judge's ruling is based on the facts and allegations presented in the FAC, which alleged that Min Zhou failed to repay a loan of $1,500,000 to Zhao, and that Min Zhou had made representations to Zhao about repaying the loan. The judge found that the FAC adequately pleaded the elements of fraud, including misrepresentation, knowledge of falsity, intent to defraud, justifiable reliance, and resulting damage.

The judge also found that Min Zhou's demurrer to the breach of written contract cause of action was sustained because the FAC failed to plead the legal effect of the contract rather than its precise language. The judge ordered Min Zhou to file an answer in ten (10) days.
