  Case Number:  23STCV22893    Hearing Date:   September 4, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendant
Dawn Suskin’s Motions to Compel Further Responses (1) to Special
Interrogatories and (2) to Requests for Production of Documents
(1) Special Interrogatories
            Defendant
Dawn Suskin moves to compel plaintiff FirstService Residential California, LLC
to serve further responses to special interrogatories Nos. 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26,
30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 48, 49, 50, 60, 61,
62, 72, 73, 74, 82, 84, 85, 86, 90, 97, 98, 99, 102, 109, 111, 112, 113, 122,
123, 124, 143, 144, and 145.  A
party may move to compel further responses to interrogatories when an answer
“is evasive or incomplete” (CCP § 2030.300(a)(1)) or an objection “is without
merit or too general” (id.,
subd. (a)(3)).
            Plaintiff’s
responses to the special interrogatories begin with a “preliminary statement
and general objections.”  (Heck Decl.,
Ex. 5, pp. 2-3.)  A party responding to
interrogatories “shall respond in writing under oath separately to each
interrogatory.”  (CCP § 2030.210(a).)  General objections are, by definition, “too
general.”  (CCP § 2030.300(a)(3).)  Plaintiff’s general objections are overruled.  
            In response to 29 interrogatories,
plaintiff made the same meritless objection: “FirstService objects to this
request on the grounds that it seeks information that is equally available to
Suskin.”  (E.g., Nos. 14-16, 18,
19.)  
One cannot “refus[e] to answer an
interrogatory simply upon the ground that the answer is known to the party
seeking the information.”  (Singer v.
Superior Court of Contra Costa County (1960) 54 Cal.2d 318, 324.)  This response only applies to the extent the
responding party does not know the answer. 
“If an interrogatory cannot be answered completely, it shall be answered
to the extent possible.”  (CCP §
2030.220(b).)  “If the responding party
does not have personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an
interrogatory, that party shall so state, but shall make a reasonable and good
faith effort to obtain the information by inquiry to other natural persons or
organizations, except where the information is equally available to the
propounding party.”  (Id., subd.
(c).)  Plaintiff responding party thus
must answer the question (at least in part), if possible, based on its personal
knowledge.  
Plaintiff also gave numerous evasive
answers.  The court will give some
examples.  No. 14 asked defendant to
“state the name of all persons involved in any efforts you undertook to try and
prevent Playa Vista Parks & Landscape Corporation from transitioning to
Seabreeze Management Company, Inc. after you received notice that Playa Vista
Parks & Landscape Corporation was terminating its property management
agreement with you.”  Plaintiff
responded, “Discovery is ongoing, and FirstService reserves the right to
supplements its response as additional information becomes available.”  Promising future responses is not a valid
answer.  If plaintiff currently cannot
answer a question at all, it must say that under oath.  But this question asks about “efforts you
[plaintiff] undertook.”  Plaintiff
necessarily knows that information.  
Similarly, No. 15 asks plaintiff to “describe
with specificity all communications you had with any board member of Playa
Vista … concerning [its] termination of its property management agreement
before you receive notice of the termination.” 
Plaintiff responded, “Suskin actively took part in mounting a
deliberate, surreptitious, and deceptive campaign to arrange the termination of
FirstService as the Association’s management company and to transition the
Association to Seabreeze.  Suskin’s
maneuvers were largely kept secret.  Thus,
FirstService believes there are other writings and communications in Suskin’s possession.
 Discovery is ongoing and additional
facts will be discovered and disclosed. Without waiving said objections, please
see the documents produced in concurrent with these responses.”  As with No. 14, plaintiff necessarily knows
what communications it had with others.    
For another example, No. 113 asks, “If you
contend Dawn Suskin interfered in any manner with any relationships with your employees
at any time, please describe the method you used to calculate the dollar amount
of each type of damage you sustained as a result of the interference.”  Plaintiff responded with numerous objections,
and ultimately simply referred to the answer to No. 1.  No. 1 asked, “Please state the date Dawn
Suskin’s employment with you began.”  A
proper answer to that question would be simply a date—which would not be an
answer to No. 113.  Instead of answering
No. 1 as asked, plaintiff’s answer essentially restates the complaint’s
allegations.  That does not describe how
plaintiff calculated its damages.  For several
other interrogatories, plaintiff again referred to the answer to No. 1, though
it did not at all pertain to the question asked.
Plaintiff makes conclusory arguments that the
interrogatories are unduly burdensome.  A party objecting
based on undue burden must present “ ‘evidence showing the quantum of work
required.’ ” (Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 549.)  Plaintiff presented no such evidence.
            Plaintiff does not
justify any of its objections. 
Plaintiff’s objections to the disputed special interrogatories are overruled.
(2) Requests for Production            
            Defendant
Dawn Suskin moves to compel plaintiff FirstService Residential California, LLC
to serve further responses to requests for production Nos. 1-105.  A
party propounding requests for production may move to compel further responses
if “[a] statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete,” “[a]
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive,”
or “[a]n objection in the response is without merit or too general.”  (CCP § 2031.310(a).)
            Plaintiff
gave inadequate statements of compliance to numerous requests.  When plaintiff gave substantive responses, it
primarily presented arguments about its theory of the case, followed by, “See
documents produced Bates numbered as [various].”  (E.g., Nos. 1-10.)  Identifying
certain documents is insufficient.  A
statement of compliance must state that “all documents or things in the
demanded category that are in the possession, custody, or control of that party
and to which no objection is being made will be included in the
production.”  (CCP § 2031.220.)  A statement of compliance must include that
precise language because it states under oath not only that the responding party
will produce specified documents, but also that the responding party is not
withholding any responsive documents.  
Plaintiff objected
that several requests were “duplicative of other requests.”  Plaintiff did not justify that objection by
explaining which requests were duplicative. 
The responses do not identify any other request that would include the same
documents.  
Plaintiff also gave
inadequate representations of inability to comply.  For example, to No. 77, it responded only,
“FSR is not aware of any writings regarding this request.”  Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.230
provides, “A representation of inability to comply with the particular demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling shall affirm that a diligent
search and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with that
demand.  This statement shall also
specify whether the inability to comply is because the particular item or
category has never existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or
stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control
of the responding party.  The statement
shall set forth the name and address of any natural person or organization
known or believed by that party to have possession, custody, or control of that
item or category of item.”  Plaintiff’s
response did not attest to a diligent search and reasonable inquiry, did not
state whether the documents never existed, were lost, or any other explanation,
and did not identify anyone else believed to have possession of responsive
documents.   
Plaintiff again
makes conclusory arguments that the requests for production are unduly
burdensome.  Plaintiff did not present
evidence supporting that objection. 
Plaintiff does not justify any other objections.  
Plaintiff’s
objections to requests for production Nos. 1-105 are overruled.  
Sanctions
            Defendant
moves for $4,710 in sanctions against plaintiff.  A court must impose sanctions against a party
“who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to”
interrogatories or requests for production, “unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (CCP §§ 2030.300(d) [interrogatories],
2031.310(h) [requests for production].) 
Plaintiff unsuccessfully opposed these motions.  It did not act with substantial
justification.  Sanctions are just under
the circumstances.  Defendant reasonably
incurred $4,710 in expenses.

Defendant Dawn Suskin’s motion to compel
further responses to special interrogatories is granted.  Plaintiff FirstService Residential California,
LLC is ordered to serve further verified responses without objections to

41, 42, 43, 45, 48, 49, 50, 60, 61, 62, 72, 73, 74, 82, 84, 85, 86, 90, 97, 98,
