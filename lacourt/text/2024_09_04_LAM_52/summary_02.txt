Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of JDBR Investments, LLC v. Andre Wegner and Drinkwater Investment Group, LLC. The plaintiff, JDBR Investments, LLC, is seeking a default judgment against the defendants, Andre Wegner and Drinkwater Investment Group, LLC. However, the court has determined that it cannot enter a default judgment against defendant Andre Wegner because he was not served with a summons in the manner prescribed by statute. The court has vacated Wegner's default.

The plaintiff's request for default judgment has two other problems. First, the plaintiff is seeking excessive attorney fees, which are limited to a specified schedule based on the amount of the judgment. The court has calculated the reasonable attorney fees to be $6,236.84. Second, the plaintiff did not submit the original promissory note for cancellation or provide a declaration explaining why the original note is unavailable, which is required for default judgment in an action on a promissory note.
