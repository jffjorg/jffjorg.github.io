 Case Number:  24STCV02192    Hearing Date:   September 4, 2024    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Default
Judgment
Plaintiff JDBR Investments, LLC requests court judgment by default
against defendants Andre Wegner and Drinkwater Investment Group, LLC.  
The
court cannot enter default judgment against defendant Andre Wegner.  “
‘[C]ompliance with the statutory procedures for service of process is essential
to establish personal jurisdiction. 
[Citation.]  Thus, a default
judgment entered against a defendant who was not served with a summons in the
manner prescribed by statute is void.’ ” 
(Ellard v. Conway (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 540, 544.)  
Plaintiff has not shown it
effected service of summons on Wegner.  Plaintiff
filed proof of service by substituted service stating Wegner’s physical address
was unknown.  An individual can only be
served by substituted service “[i]f a copy of the summons and complaint cannot
with reasonable diligence be personally delivered to the person to be
served.”  (CCP § 415.20(b).)  “Ordinarily, two or three attempts at personal service at a
proper place and with correct pleadings should fully satisfy the requirement of
reasonable diligence and allow substituted service to be made.”  (Kremerman v. White (2021) 71
Cal.App.5th 358, 373.)
Plaintiff
has not shown it could not personally serve Wegner with reasonable
diligence.  The only declaration of
diligence attests to two attempts to serve Wegner at 1352 Palms Blvd, Venice, CA 90251. 
The process server stated that, on the first attempt, “There was no
answer at the address.”  For the second
attempt, the process server stated, “I spoke with an individual who identified
themselves as the resident and they stated subject unknown.  I spoke with a neighbor who says not resident.
 This is a house.”  The process server thus learned Wegner did
not live at that address.  Attempts to
serve him there were not “at a proper place.” 

Moreover, plaintiff’s complaint alleges, “Wegner
could be currently residing in the County of Collin, State of Texas.”  (Comp., ¶ 3.) 
The declaration in support of this application for default judgment
includes a LexisNexis “SmartLinx Person Report”, which states Wegner’s current
address is 1502 W. Virginia St., McKinney, TX 75069-4661. (Rocco Decl., Ex. 7,
p. 55 of 64.)  The report also lists
several other possible addresses for him. 
Plaintiff has not submitted evidence of attempts to personally serve Wegner
at the address in McKinney, Texas or any other possible address except the one
in Venice, California—where he did not live. 
Nor has plaintiff shown attempts to serve Wegner by any other
method.  The court will therefore vacate
Wegner’s default.  
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment also has
two other problems.  First, plaintiff
seeks excessive attorney fees.  Plaintiff
requests $13,081 in attorney fees. 
Attorney fees for
a default judgment are generally limited to a specified schedule based on the
amount of the judgment.  (Local Rules
3.207(a), 3.214(a).)  A plaintiff may
recover “a fee greater than listed in
the [default] schedule because of extraordinary services.”  (Id., rule 3.214(d).)  Plaintiff does not show extraordinary
services justifying a fee greater than the schedule.  Under the fee schedule, plaintiff’s
reasonable attorney fees are: $2,890 + 1% x ($434,684 - $100,000) = $6,236.84.
Second,
plaintiff did not submit the original promissory note for cancellation or
provide a declaration explaining why the original note is unavailable.  Doing so is required for default judgment in
an action on a promissory note.  (Cal.
Rules of Court, rules 3.1800(a)(8), 3.1806; Local Rule 3.204.)
Plaintiff’s request for default
judgment is denied.  The court hereby
vacates the default of defendant Andre Wegner.
