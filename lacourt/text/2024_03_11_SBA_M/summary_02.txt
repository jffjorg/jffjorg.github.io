Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Defendant Bright A. Egwuatu's motion to quash service of summons and complaint, and sets aside the entry of default. The judge finds that the proof of service does not establish that Defendant was personally served on August 4, 2022, and that no substitute service was effectuated. The plaintiff's opposition to the motion was filed late and did not provide proof of service. The judge concludes that the plaintiff failed to meet her burden to establish that proper jurisdiction was obtained over the defendant. As a result, the judge grants the defendant's motion to quash service of summons and sets aside the entry of default.
