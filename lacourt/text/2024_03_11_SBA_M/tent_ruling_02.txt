            Vickie Ford v. Bright A. Egwuatu, et al. 
            23TRCV02257
1.      Bright
A. Egwuatu’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons and Complaint and to Set Aside
Entry of Default
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Bright A. Egwuatu’s Motion to Quash Service
of Summons and Complaint and to Set Aside Entry of Default is granted.      
 
            Background
 
            Plaintiff
filed the Complaint on July 13, 2023. Plaintiff alleges the following facts. Plaintiff
leased property at 400 East Manchester Boulevard, Suite B, Inglewood, CA 90301
for her bail bond business. The property began to have a foul odor and flood.
There was also a broken window that Defendant refused to repair. Plaintiff
repaired it herself. In retaliation for Plaintiff deducting the expenses of the
repairs from the monthly rental amount, Defendant filed a small claims court
case against Plaintiff and made defamatory statements to the handling Judge. Plaintiff
alleges the following causes of action: 1. Libel
Per Se; 2. Trade Libel; 3. Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage. 
 
            Motion
to Quash 
 
            Code
Civ. Proc., § 415.10 states: 
            “A
summons may be served by personal delivery of a copy of the summons and of the
complaint to the person to be served. Service of a summons in this manner is
deemed complete at the time of such delivery. The date upon which personal
delivery is made shall be entered on or affixed to the face of the copy of the
summons at the time of its delivery. However, service of a summons without such
date shall be valid and effective.”
 
            Code
Civ. Proc., § 416.10 states:
            “A
summons may be served on a corporation by delivering a copy of the summons and
the complaint by any of the following methods:
(a) To the person designated as agent for service of
process as provided by any provision in Section 202, 1502, 2105, or 2107 of the
Corporations Code (or Sections 3301 to 3303, inclusive, or Sections 6500 to
6504, inclusive, of the Corporations Code, as in effect on December 31, 1976,
with respect to corporations to which they remain applicable).
(b) To the president, chief executive officer, or
other head of the corporation, a vice president, a secretary or assistant
secretary, a treasurer or assistant treasurer, a controller or chief financial
officer, a general manager, or a person authorized by the corporation to
receive service of process.
(c) If the corporation is a bank, to a cashier or
assistant cashier or to a person specified in subdivision (a) or (b).
(d) If authorized by any provision in Section 1701,
1702, 2110, or 2111 of the Corporations Code (or Sections 3301 to 3303,
inclusive, or Sections 6500 to 6504, inclusive, of the Corporations Code, as in
effect on December 31, 1976, with respect to corporations to which they remain
applicable), as provided by that provision.”
 
            Code
Civ. Proc., § 415.20 states, in relevant part: 
            “(a)
In lieu of personal delivery of a copy of the summons and complaint to the
person to be served as specified in Section 416.10, 416.20, 416.30, 416.40, or
416.50, a summons may be served by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint
during usual office hours in his or her office or, if no physical address is
known, at his or her usual mailing address, other than a United States Postal
Service post office box, with the person who is apparently in charge thereof,
and by thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and complaint by first-class
mail, postage prepaid to the person to be served at the place where a copy of
the summons and complaint were left. When service is effected by leaving a copy
of the summons and complaint at a mailing address, it shall be left with a
person at least 18 years of age, who shall be informed of the contents thereof.
Service of a summons in this manner is deemed complete on the 10th day after
the mailing.”
 
            Code
Civ. Proc., § 418.10 states, in relevant part: “(a) A defendant, on or before
the last day of his or her time to plead or within any further time that the
court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a notice of motion for one
or more of the following purposes: (1) To quash service of summons on the
ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.”
 
            Substantial compliance requires a showing
of the following: there must be some degree of compliance, that the
circumstances show that it was highly probable that attempted service imparted
the same notice as full compliance, and that the attempted service provided
sufficient notice to Defendant to put on a defense. Carol Gilbert, Inc. v.
Haller (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 852, 865-66.
 
            Pursuant
to CCP § 418.10(a)(1), Defendant moves to quash service of the summons on the
grounds that he was not properly served with the summons and complaint under CCP
§ 415.10. Defendant contends that he was never personally served on August 4, 2022,
at 400 E. Manchester Blvd. Inglewood, CA 90301 as indicated on the proof of
service that was executed by a non-registered process server. Defendant also
contends that no substitute service was effectuated. The Court notes that the
proof of service does not attempt to state that substitute service was
effectuated only personal service.
 
            Plaintiff
filed a very late opposition on March 6, 2024, only three court days prior to
the hearing rather than the mandated nine court days pursuant to CCP § 1005(b).
In addition, no proof of service was attached to the opposition. Plaintiff
simply reiterates that proper personal service was effectuated and argues that
Defendant admitted to it. In fact, Defendant did not admit to it. Defendant
stated that he found an envelope outside of his office that contained the
summons and complaint.  Such facts
certainly do not constitute an admission of proper personal service.  Plaintiff also argues for a presumption of
proper service by a registered process server. Evid. Code § 647 states: “The
return of a process server registered pursuant to Chapter 16 (commencing with
Section 22350) of Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code upon process
or notice establishes a presumption, affecting the burden of producing
evidence, of the facts stated in the return.” However, the proof of service
filed on August 7, 2023, specifically indicates that the person serving process
was not a registered process server.  Plaintiff
has failed to meet her burden to establish that proper jurisdiction has been
obtained as to Defendant.
 
            Therefore,
Defendant’s motion to quash service of summons is granted.  Defendant’s request to set aside the default
is hereby granted. 
 
            Defendant
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
