And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Mary Hisako Morishita's motion for a trial preference without prejudice. Morishita, who is over 70 years old, alleges that she tripped and fell on two separate occasions while trying to board and exit a Gardena Transit bus, and seeks a trial preference due to her age and health condition. The Judge finds that Morishita has submitted competent evidence that she has a substantial interest in the action and that her health is such that a trial preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing her interest.

However, the Judge notes that Morishita failed to comply with California Code of Civil Procedure § 36(c)(1), which requires a declaration that all essential parties have been served with process or have appeared. The Judge also finds that Morishita's motion does not meet the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure § 36(e), which allows the court to grant a motion for preference in its discretion.

The Judge reminds the parties that timely and expeditious responses to discovery are essential, especially when an expedited trial date is sought, and warns that failure to comply with discovery obligations may lead to contested law and motion hearings and unnecessary delays in proceedings. The Judge's tentative ruling is subject to change after further consideration and argument.
