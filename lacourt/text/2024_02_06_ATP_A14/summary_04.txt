And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the Demurrer filed by the Defendants, Best Western International, Inc. and Bains Hospitality, LLC, to the Plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint. The Plaintiff, Isabelle Hill, alleges that she suffered personal injuries and monetary damages as a result of the Defendants' alleged negligence and intentional conduct in allowing bedbugs to infest the hotel room she rented.

The Court has found that the Plaintiff's allegations of intentional infliction of emotional distress are sufficient to survive the Demurrer, but has sustained the Demurrer as to the Plaintiff's claims for public nuisance and breach of contract. The Court has also declined to grant leave to amend.

The Court's reasoning is as follows: the Plaintiff has failed to allege facts demonstrating that the bedbug infestation affected the community at large, and has not properly pled the alleged contract at issue. The Plaintiff has also made no changes to the Fourth Cause of Action (Public Nuisance) since the FAC and has never attached the contract or recited the terms of the alleged contract. Finally, the Plaintiff has not opposed a filed demurrer since the Demurrer to the Complaint.
