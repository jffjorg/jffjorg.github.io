 Case Number:  23AVCV01156    Hearing Date:   February 6, 2024    Dept:  A14 Background
 
This is a mortgage foreclosure
action. Plaintiff Javier Ortiz (“Plaintiff”) alleges that he acquired real
property legally known as Lot 39, of Tract No. 46757, in the City of Palmdale,
state of California, recorded in Book 1301, pages 64-73, in the official
records of the County Recorder, County of Los Angeles, State of California, APN
3024-036-039 (the “Subject Property”) pursuant to a Deed of Trust in favor of
Defendants Qualityloan Service Corporation (“Qualityloan”); Select Portfolio
Servicing, Inc. (“Select Portfolio”); Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as
owner trustee of CMSC 2021-RPL11 (“Wilmington Savings”); and all persons claiming
legal, equitable, lien, and estate in the property  located at 38140 Archwood Way, Palmdale,
California 93552, APN 3024-036-039. Plaintiff further alleges that
Defendants failed to comply with provisions of federal and California law as
they have refused and continue to consider Plaintiff for a loan modification or
his request for approval of a short sale as they state he does not qualify. Plaintiff
presents that Defendants recorded a Notice of Default and election to sell
under Deed of Trust with a recorded sale date of October 24, 2023 at 10:00 am.
Plaintiff disputes the validity of Defendants’ declaration and any claims of
exemption from the time frame for giving notice of a sale under Cal. Civ. Code
§ 2923.52.
 
On October 12, 2023, Plaintiff
filed his Complaint alleging three causes of action for: (1) Injunction
Enjoining Defendants from Foreclosing on Plaintiff’s Property on October 24,
2023 at 10:00 am, Pending Exhaustion of Alternative Means of Retention
Including Loan Modification or a Short Sale; (2) Unfair Business Practice; and
(3) Declaratory Relief. 
 
On October 26, 2023, Defendants Select
Portfolio and Wilmington Savings filed a Demurrer to the Complaint,
subsequently sustained on January 02, 2024. Leave to amend was given as to the
Second Cause of Action (Unfair Business Practice).
 
On December 28, 2023, Select
Portfolio filed this Motion Deem the Truth of Matters and Genuineness of
Documents Admitted and Sanctions in the Amount of $1,587.00 (“Motion to Deem
RFAs Admitted). 
 
No Opposition has been filed. “All
papers opposing a motion so noticed shall be filed with the court and a copy
served on each party at least nine court days. . .before the hearing.” (Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. § 1005(b).) “Section 1013, which extends the time within which
a right may be exercised or an act may be done, does not apply to a notice of
motion, papers opposing a motion, or reply papers governed by this section.” (Ibid.)
The hearing on this matter is set for February 06, 2024. Accordingly, an
Opposition was due by January 24, 2024.
 
Should
an Opposition be filed, it is now untimely.

Legal Standard
 
Standard for Deeming Admissions Admitted
– Where there has been no timely response to a request for admission under Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. (Cal. Code
Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(b).) Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c) states, in
relevant part: “The court shall make this order, unless it finds that the party
to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the
hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that
is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
2033.280(c).)¿

Discussion
 
Application – Select
Portfolio moves to deem Requests for Admission (“RFAs”) admitted against
Plaintiff. 
 
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.250
provides: 
 
“Within 30 days after service of requests
for admission, the party to whom the requests are directed shall serve the
original of the response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the
response on all other parties who have appeared, unless on motion of the
requesting party the court has shortened the time for response, or unless on
motion of the responding party the court has extended the time for
response.” 
 
(Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.250(a).) 
 
Select Portfolio presents that
they served the Requests for Admission (“RFAs”) to Plaintiff on November 15,
2023. (Decl. James J. Ramos ¶ 3, Exh. 1.) Thus, responses were due December 15,
2023. Counsel for Select Portfolio, James J. Ramos (“Ramos”), declares that
Plaintiff neither served responses nor reached out to request an extension.
(Decl. James J. Ramos ¶¶ 5-6.) To date, Plaintiff has failed to serve
responses. 
 
Accordingly, the Motion to Deem
RFAs Admitted is GRANTED.

Sanctions
 
Select Portfolio requests sanctions
in the amount of $1,587.00 (1.6 hrs @ $345.00/hr) in connection with this
motion. 
 
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c)
provides, in relevant part:
 
It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.
 
Accordingly, the Court imposes a
sanction of $500.00 on Plaintiff.

Servicing, Inc.’s Motion to Deem the Truth of Matters and Genuineness of
