 Case Number:  21AVCV00425    Hearing Date:   February 6, 2024    Dept:  A14 Background
 
This is a personal injury action. Plaintiff
Western General Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) alleges that on or about July
05, 2019, Defendants Fabiola Sant Maria (“Fabiola”)1 and Marcela Santa Maria (“Marcela”)
negligently and carelessly drove, maintained, owned, managed, entrusted and
operated their vehicle so as to cause it to collide the vehicle driven by
Plaintiff’s insured individuals, Juan Ramos Preciado and Marisela S Preciado,
at or about the intersection E. Palmdale Avenue and 30th Street East in
Palmdale, California 93550. Plaintiff further alleges damages in the following
amounts: (1) $4,339.68 in property damage, and $30,000.00 in damages to Juan
Ramos Preciado and Marisela S Preciado’s persons.  
 
On May 25, 2021, Plaintiff filed its
Complaint for Property Damages and Uninsured Motorist Bodily
Injury.  
 
On July 21, 2021, Fabiola filed her Answer
to the Complaint. 
 
On January 04, 2022, Marcela was placed in
default.  
 
On June 09, 2022, the Court held a hearing
on Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admissions (“RFAs”) Admitted as to
Fabiola. The Court granted the motion.  
 
On January 18, 2023, Plaintiff amended the
fictitious name of Doe 1 to Michael Bacelis. 
 
On May 10, 2023, Plaintiff amended the
incorrect name of Michael Bacelis to Michael Angelo Bacelis, Jr. (“Bacelis,
Jr.”).  
 
On June 05, 2023, Bacelis, Jr. filed his
Answer to the Complaint. 
 
On November 07, 2023, the Court
held a hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem RFAs Admitted as to Bacelis, Jr.
The Court granted the motion. 
 
On December 27, 2023, Plaintiff
filed this Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (“MJOP”). 
 
No Opposition has been filed. “All
papers opposing a motion so noticed shall be filed with the court and a copy
served on each party at least nine court days. . .before the hearing.” (Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. § 1005(b).) “Section 1013, which extends the time within which
a right may be exercised or an act may be done, does not apply to a notice of
motion, papers opposing a motion, or reply papers governed by this section.” (Ibid.)
The hearing on this matter is set for February 06, 2024. Accordingly, an
Opposition was due by January 24, 2024. Should an Opposition be filed, it is
now untimely.

Legal Standard
 
Standard for Judgment on the Pleadings – A plaintiff may move for judgment on the
pleadings only when the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause
or causes of action against the defendant and the answer does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a defense to the complaint. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
438(c)(1)(A).)¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
A motion for judgment on the pleadings
challenges the legal sufficiency of a pleading’s allegations, not their
veracity. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) Thus, a motion for judgment on the pleadings is the functional equivalent
of a general demurrer. (Lance Camper Mfg. Corp. v. Republic Indemnity Co. of
Am. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 194, 198; see also Cloud
v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 995, 999 [“A motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same
function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the
face of the pleadings or by matters that can be judicially noticed.
Presentation of extrinsic evidence is therefore not proper on a motion for
judgment on the pleadings.”].)¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
The standard for ruling on a
motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as that applicable
to a general demurrer, that is, under the state of the pleadings, together with
matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. (Bezirdjian v. O'Reilly (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 316, 321-322 [citing Schabarum v. California Legislature
(1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216].)¿Any defects must either appear on the face of the pleading, or else be
taken by judicial notice. (Id. at 321-22.) The parties’ ability to prove
their respective claims is of no concern. (Cloud, supra, 67
Cal.App.4th 995 at 999.) ¿¿
 
A motion by a plaintiff for judgment on the
pleadings is in the nature of a general demurrer to the answer, and the motion
must be denied if the answer raises a material issue or sets up affirmative
matter constituting a defense. Such a motion does not operate as a special
demurrer. Uncertainty and ambiguities must be specifically raised by proper
procedure. (MacIsaac v. Pozzo (1945) 26 Cal.2d 809, 812-813; Fabbro
v. Dardi & Co. (1949) 93 Cal.App.2d 247, 252; Bergerow v. Parker
(1906) 4 Cal.App. 169, 172.) Where the answer, fairly construed, suggests that
the defendant may have a good defense, a motion for judgment on the pleadings
should not be granted. (Patterson v. Pacific Indem. Co. (1931) 119
Cal.App. 203, 206-207.) The moving party admits the untruth of his own
allegations insofar as they have been controverted, and all such averments must
be disregarded whether there is a direct and specific denial or an indirect
denial by virtue of affirmative allegations of a contrary state of facts. (MacIsaac,
supra, 26 Cal.2d 809, 813; Osborne v. Abels (1939) 30 Cal.App.2d
729, 730.) Every allegation affirmatively pleaded in the answer must be deemed
true. (Cuneo v. Lawson (1924) 203 Cal. 190, 193.)

Discussion
 
Requests for judicial Notice
– GRANTED.
 
Application – Plaintiff
emphasizes that “the court may take judicial notice of matters that cannot be
reasonably controverted, including; admissions and concessions’ ” and, the
Requests for Judicial Notice of the order granting the Motion to Deem
Admissions Admitted and the admissions, removes any issues raised by Bacelis,
Jr in his Answer. (MJOP 7:5-10 [citing Evans v. California Trailer Court,
Inc. (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 540, 549].) 
 
Bacelis, Jr.’s Answer states that
he denies each allegation of the following numbered paragraphs, no numbered
paragraphs specified; and that he has “no knowledge of this incident involving
Fabiola Santa Maria and Marcela Santa Maria.” (Request for Judicial Notice,
Exh. A.)
 
Plaintiff has included Request
for Judicial Notice Exhibit B, the Motion to Deem Admissions Admitted, and
Request for Judicial Notice Exhibit C, this Court’s Order granting the Motion
to Deem Admissions Admitted; however, it does not include the RFAs admitted by
Bacelis, Jr. The Court takes judicial notice of its records pursuant to Cal.
Evid. Code § 452(d). The Court has provided this tentative to afford each party
reasonable opportunity to meet such information before judicial notice of the
matter may be taken. (See Cal. Evid. Code § 455.)
 
The following has been deemed
admitted against Bacelis, Jr:
 
1.      Admit
that at the time of the INCIDENT, you were the driver of the VEHICLE. (For
purposes of these requests, the term INCIDENT refers to the accident upon which
this action was based; the term VEHICLE refers to the motor vehicle you were
driving at the time of the INCIDENT).
2.      Admit
that at the time of the INCIDENT, you failed to drive with reasonable care.
3.      Admit
that your driving was the sole cause of the COLLISION with plaintiffs INSURED
VEHICLE. (For purposes of these requests, the term COLLISION refers to the
motor vehicle accident which is the basis of the INCIDENT; the term INSURED
VEHICLE refers to the other vehicle involved in the INCIDENT for which
plaintiff is seeking to recover damages.)
4.      Admit
you were at least 1% at fault in causing the COLLISION.
5.      Admit
you were 100% at fault in causing the COLLISION.
6.      Admit
that as a result of the COLLISION, you caused the INSURED to incur damages.
(For purposes of these requests, the term INSURED refers to the owner of the
INSURED VEHICLE.)
7.      Admit
that as a result of the COLLISION, you caused the INSURED to incur damages of
at least $34,339.68.
8.      Admit
that plaintiff as the insurer for the INSURED has been damaged in the amount of
at least $34,339.68 as a result of the INCIDENT.
9.      Admit
that the affirmative defenses you have asserted in this matter lack merit and
evidentiary support.
 
(Motion to Deem RFAs Admitted,
Exh. A.)
 
Bacelis, Jr. has admitted that
his affirmative defenses lack merit, that he caused the incident, that he was
at fault for causing the incident, and that he caused damages amounting to at
least $34,339.68. Due to these admissions, the Answer does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a defense to the complaint.
 
Accordingly, the MJOP is GRANTED.

Leave to Amend
 
Plaintiff argues that leave to
amend should not be granted as there is no reasonable probability that Bacelis,
Jr. can amend his Answer due to the admissions that have been deemed admitted.
 
Leave to amend
must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy¿(1976), 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) While under
California law leave to amend is liberally granted, “leave to amend should not
be granted where, in all probability, amendment would be futile.” (Vaillette
v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. (1993), 18 Cal. App. 4th 680, 685).¿ “A trial
court does not abuse its discretion when it sustains a demurrer without¿leave
to amend¿if either (a) the facts and the nature of the claims are clear and no
liability exists, or (b) it is probable from the nature of the defects and
previous unsuccessful attempts to plead that the plaintiff cannot state a
claim.” (Cantu v. Resolution Trust Corp.¿(1992)¿4 Cal.App.4th 857,
889.)¿¿¿ 
 
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
2033.300(b) allows a court to permit the withdrawal or amendment of admissions
only if the court “determines that the admission was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and that the party who obtained the
admission will not be substantially prejudiced in maintaining that party’s
action or defense on the merits.” Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 437(b) allows a court
to, “upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal
representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken
against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.”
 
However, Bacelis, Jr. has not
requested any form of relief.
 
With that in mind, the Court
believes that, at this time and based on the facts in this case, there is no
reasonable possibility of a successful amendment.
 
Accordingly, the Court declines
to allow leave to amend.

for Judgment on the Pleadings is GRANTED.
