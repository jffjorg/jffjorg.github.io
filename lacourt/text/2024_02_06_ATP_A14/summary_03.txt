Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants Plaintiff Western General Insurance Company's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, which seeks judgment on the pleadings against defendants Fabiola Sant Maria, Marcela Santa Maria, and Michael Angelo Bacelis, Jr. The judge finds that the Answer does not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense to the complaint, as Bacelis, Jr. has admitted to causing the incident, being at fault, and causing damages. The judge also declines to allow leave to amend, finding that there is no reasonable possibility of a successful amendment.
