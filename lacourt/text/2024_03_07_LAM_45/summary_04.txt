And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the petition to approve the compromise of disputed claims for five minors: Pocahuntes Riley, Timothy Riley, Sincere Riley, Janelle Age, and one other minor whose name is not specified. The compromise is for a total of $4,000.00, with $1,000.00 going towards attorney's fees and the remaining $3,000.00 to be deposited into a blocked account. The court finds that the proposed settlement is fair and reasonable, and that the requested attorney's fees are also fair and reasonable. The court sets an OSC (Order to Show Cause) for proof of deposit and notes that if an acknowledgement of receipt by the financial institution is filed before the date set, no appearance will be required.
