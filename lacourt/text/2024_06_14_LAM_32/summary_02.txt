And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court rules on several motions filed by the defendants in this product liability action. The court overrules the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for fraudulent concealment and denies the demurrer to the fifth cause of action for punitive damages.

The court grants the motion to strike the phrase "and other silica-containing stone products to be identified during the course of discovery" from the plaintiff's complaint.

The court grants the defendant Guidoni USA Inc.'s motion to quash service of summons, finding that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over Guidoni.

The court notes that the plaintiff failed to show that Guidoni's shipment of 34 containers of artificial stone products to the Port of Long Beach constitutes continuous and systematic contacts necessary for general personal jurisdiction. The court also finds that the plaintiff failed to show that Guidoni purposefully availed itself of California's benefits.
