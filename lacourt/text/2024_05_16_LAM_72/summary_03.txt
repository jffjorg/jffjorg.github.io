And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint as to the claims for violation of meal and rest breaks and Business and Professions Code sections 17200. However, the motion is denied as to the claim for failure to pay wages. The judge notes that the proposed amended complaint does not contain a claim for failure to pay wages. The judge also finds that the delay in filing the motion was primarily due to the defendants' actions, and therefore, the defendants are not prejudiced by the delay. The judge further finds that the statute of limitations has expired for the wage claim, but the UCL claim is not time-barred. The judge grants leave to amend as to the UCL and break claims, but not the wage claim.
