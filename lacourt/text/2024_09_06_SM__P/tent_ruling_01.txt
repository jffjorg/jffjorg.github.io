Paul J. Cohen, et
al. v. Michael Kaplan, et al., Case No. 20SMCV01214 
Hearing Date: September
6, 2024 
Cross-Defendant
Bloch’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees 
 
Plaintiffs Cohen
sued for quiet title and trespass related to property in Malibu. Defendants Kaplan
cross-complained. The parties negotiated a settlement, which was not executed
by Elaine Cohen. The Kaplans thereafter sued Cohen’s counsel cross-defendant moving
party Bloch. His anti-SLAPP motion against the TACC was granted; he seeks prevailing
party fees and costs. 
 
Cross-defendant
Bloch’s objections nos. 1-4 are SUSTAINED as the disputed statements and
exhibits are not relevant to the reasonableness of the hours claimed.
 
Attorneys’ Fees and Costs
Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16(c)(1) states “a prevailing
defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover that
defendant’s attorney’s fees and costs.” The award of attorneys’ fees and costs
to a prevailing anti-SLAPP defendant is mandatory. Ketchum v. Moses
(2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1131. 
 
The
Court granted Bloch’s anti-SLAPP. Minute Order 5/2/24. As the prevailing party, Bloch’s motion is proper, and he is entitled to attorneys’
fees. 
 
Reasonable Fees
The
California Supreme Court has determined the lodestar method is the proper
mechanism to calculate attorneys’ fees under Code of Civil Procedure section
425.16(c). Ketchum, 24 Cal.4th at 1136. To calculate a lodestar amount,
the court must determine the reasonableness of the hourly rates sought. The
“reasonable hourly rate” applicable under the lodestar method is the rate
“prevailing in the community for similar work.” PLCM Group v. Drexler
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095. “The trial court makes its determination after
consideration of a number of factors, including the nature of the litigation,
its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in its handling, the
skill employed, the attention given, the success or failure, and other
circumstances in the case.” Id. at 1096.
 
Bloch
seeks fees for attorney Berman at an hourly rate of $725. Berman Decl. ¶27.
Berman argues that the rate is reasonable because he has been a civil litigator
for nearly 38 years, and the rate is conservative compared to similarly
situated attorneys. Id. ¶35. Kaplan’s opposition does not dispute the
hourly rate. The court finds the hourly rate reasonable. 
 
Billed
Hours
The
verified time entries of the attorneys are entitled to a presumption of
credibility, which extends to an attorney’s professional judgment as to whether
time spent was reasonably necessary to the litigation. Horsford v. Board of
Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396
[“We think the verified time statements of the attorney as officers of the
court are entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records
are erroneous.”].  “California courts do
not require detailed time records, and trial courts have discretion to award
fees based on declarations of counsel describing the work they have done and
the court’s own view of the number of hours reasonably spent.” Syers
Properties III, Inc. v. Rankin (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691, 698-699.
 
Bloch
requests 47.6 hours for the anti-SLAPP motion plus $615.50 in costs. Berman
Decl. ¶34. The anti-SLAPP motion was complicated, and the hours sought are
justified via declaration. 
 
Kaplan
argues the hours are excessive. However, Berman’s
time entries are stated in the declaration, and Kaplan does not identify any
particular entry the Court should strike. Kaplan’s dispute over the cost
associated with the anti-SLAPP is also unavailing as the costs are connected to
the anti-SLAPP motion. Bloch Decl. ¶13. Thus, the 47.6 hours and cost are
related to the instant and anti-SLAPP motions. GRANTED in the amount of 47.6
hours at $725/hr., for a total of $35,126.30.
