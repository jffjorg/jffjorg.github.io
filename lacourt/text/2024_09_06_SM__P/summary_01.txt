And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Bloch's motion for attorney's fees and costs, as the prevailing party in the anti-SLAPP motion. The judge finds that Bloch is entitled to recover attorney's fees and costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16(c)(1), as the anti-SLAPP motion was granted. The judge uses the lodestar method to calculate the reasonable fees, which is based on the hourly rate of $725 and the number of hours spent on the anti-SLAPP motion. The judge finds that the hourly rate is reasonable and awards Bloch 47.6 hours at $725 per hour, for a total of $35,126.30. The judge also denies Kaplan's objections to the hours and costs, as they are related to the anti-SLAPP motion and are not excessive.
