And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Noval Jr.'s motion to expunge the lis pendens filed by WVM Holdings, LLC. The lis pendens was recorded on real property located at 1029 Westholme Ave., Los Angeles, CA. Noval Jr. argues that WVM has not asserted a real property claim against the subject property, and therefore, the lis pendens should be expunged. The judge has overruled all objections to Noval Jr.'s motion except for one, which was based on an adequate foundation.

The judge has determined that WVM has failed to meet its burden of proof to demonstrate that the action affects title to or right of possession of the real property. The complaint does not plead facts that show a real property claim, but rather alleges a series of fraudulent transfers that resulted in the funds used to purchase the property. The judge has granted the motion to expunge the lis pendens, finding that WVM has not asserted a real property claim against the subject property.
