v. Noval, et al., Case No. 22SMCV02187 
Hearing Date: September
6, 2024 
Defendant Noval’s
Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens
 
WVM Holdings, LLC
sued defendants Secured Capital Partners, Victor Franco Noval (“Noval Jr.”) and
Jake Noval, alleging a series of fraudulent transfers. Noval Jr. moves for an
order expunging the lis pendens/notice of pendency of the action WVM recorded on
real property located at 1029 Westholme Ave., Los Angeles, CA. 
 
Noval Jr.’s
objections nos. 1-15 are OVERRULED as the declaration establishes an adequate
foundation. Objections nos. 16-46 are OVERRULED as the court did not rely on the
declaration in its analysis. Objection no. 47 is OVERRULED as the declaration
establishes an adequate foundation. 
 
Any party or
non-party having an interest in the property affected by a notice of lis
pendens may move for expungement. Code Civ. Proc. §405.30. A lis pendens must
be removed for being improper on account of (a) the pleading on which the
notice is based not containing a real property claim, or (b) the claimant not
being able to establish by a preponderance of the evidence the probable
validity of the real property claim. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 405.31, 405.32; Ziello
v. Superior Court (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 321, 331-32; Urez Corp. v.
Superior Court (1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 1141, 1149.
 
In a motion to
expunge a notice of lis pendens, the claimant who filed the lis pendens has the
burden of proof. Code Civ. Proc. §405.30. That claimant must demonstrate: (1)
the action affects title to or right of possession of the real property; (2) in
so far as the notice is concerned, the party recording the notice commenced the
action for a proper purpose and in good faith; and (3) the probable validity of
the claim. Hunting World, Inc. v. Superior Court (1994) 22 Cal.App.4th
67, 70; see also Code Civ. Proc. §405.30, et seq. Only admissible evidence may
be considered. Burger v. Superior Court (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 1013,
1019.
 
Noval Jr. moves
for an order expunging the lis pendens, arguing WVM has not asserted a real
property claim against the subject property. Citing Lewis v. Superior Court
(1994) 30
Cal.App.4th 1850, he argues the complaint does not support a lis pendens
because it alleges an alter ego theory and fraudulent transfer of funds from
TPP; this claim would only entitle plaintiff to monetary damages.
He also argues WVM cannot establish by a preponderance of the evidence the
probable validity of the real property claim because there is (1) no
creditor-debtor relationship between WVM and defendants, (2) no unity of
ownership and interest between Original Judgment Debtors and Noval nor any of defendant,
and (3) the original judgment is expired and cannot be enforced.  
In opposition, WVM argues the complaint asserts a real property claim
because it seeks a constructive trust over defendant’s property purchased using
the Mountain funds. However, this does not create a real property claim because
a constructive trust is an equitable remedy. Courts have consistently held that
merely requesting a constructive trust does not create a real property claim,
barring a showing that the claim has direct implications for the title to or
possession of the property. Campbell v. Superior Court (2005) 132
Cal.App.4th 904, 921-22. 
Here, the complaint does not plead such facts; instead, it alleges a series
of fraudulent transfers that resulted in the funds that were used to purchase
the property at issue. The complaint does not mention the subject property nor any
interest in it or possession of the property, but rather alleges a constructive
trust should be imposed. Simply because the funds were used to purchase
property (as opposed to being put to some other use) does not make this a real
property claim. WVM has the burden of proof, which is not met. The motion is GRANTED.
