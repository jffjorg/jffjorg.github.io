The Assignee, Labor Commissioner of the State of California, has attempted to enforce the judgment through conventional means, but the judgment has yet to be satisfied. The Judge finds that there are no other claims or taxes with priority over the Assignee, and the judgment debtor has attempted to avoid liability by incorporating new corporate entities. The Judge grants the motion and orders the Assignee to electronically submit a proposed form of order within 5-court days of this Court's ruling.
