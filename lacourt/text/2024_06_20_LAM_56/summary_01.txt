The court finds that CFI's proposed cross-complaint arises out of the same transaction and occurrence as the claims brought by Reich and the other Plaintiffs. The court also finds that CFI has not acted in bad faith in not bringing the cross-complaint against Reich sooner. The court orders CFI to file the cross-complaint within ten days."
