And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrers filed by the defendants and denying the motions to strike as moot. The defendants had demurred to the ninth cause of action for fraudulent inducement, alleging that it lacked specificity. The Judge found that the allegations lacked specific facts about how, when, where, to whom, and by what means each misrepresentation was made, and that the cause of action was therefore uncertain and lacking the required particularity. The Judge granted the defendants 30 days' leave to amend the complaint. The motions to strike were denied as moot, as they were duplicative of the demurrers.
