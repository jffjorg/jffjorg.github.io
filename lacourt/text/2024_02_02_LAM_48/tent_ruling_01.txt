[TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING DEMURRERS; DENYING

On
May 16, 2023, Plaintiff Jia Chen, Inc. filed a second amended complaint (“SAC”)
against Defendants Deyuan Decoration Inc., Jiang Lin, and Ying Xiong.
On
June 13, 2023, each Defendant filed nearly identical demurrers and motions to strike.

DEMURRER
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.)  When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context, accepting the alleged facts as true.  (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.)  A special demurrer
for uncertainty under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (f) is
disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that defendant
or plaintiff cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what issues
must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed against him or
her.  (Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)
All
Defendants demur to the ninth cause of action for fraudulent inducement for lack
of specificity.  This cause of action alleges
both negligent misrepresentation, intentional misrepresentation, and concealment.  (SAC ¶¶ 104-107, 109, 112-113.)
“The
essential elements of a count for intentional misrepresentation are (1) a misrepresentation,
(2) knowledge of falsity, (3) intent to induce reliance, (4) actual and justifiable
reliance, and (5) resulting damage.  [Citations.]  The essential elements of a count for negligent
misrepresentation are the same except that it does not require knowledge of falsity
but instead requires a misrepresentation of fact by a person who has no reasonable
grounds for believing it to be true.  [Citations.]”  (Chapman v. Skype Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th
217, 230-231.)  “Causes of action for intentional
and negligent misrepresentation sound in fraud and, therefore, each element must
be pleaded with specificity.”  (Daniels
v. Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1150, 1166.)  “‘This particularity requirement necessitates
pleading facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the
representations were tendered.’  [Citation.]”  (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th
631, 645 (Lazar).)
Fraud
based on concealment requires that “(1) the defendant must have concealed or suppressed
a material fact, (2) the defendant must have been under a duty to disclose the fact
to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed
the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been
unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed
or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the
fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage.”  (Bigler-Engler v. Breg, Inc. (2017) 7 Cal.App.5th
276, 310-311.)
Plaintiff
alleges that in a contract signed on November 21, 2021, Lin and Xiong (under Deyuan’s
business name) represented that the materials used for the construction project
would be imported from Europe and were of higher quality than what would be typically
purchased domestically.  (SAC ¶¶¶ 14-17.)  At an unspecified time and “on multiple occasions,”
Defendants orally negligently misrepresented that Deyuan and Lin were licensed contractors
and that Xiong had the expertise to design the tenant improvements.  (SAC ¶¶ 19, 104-105.)  Defendants concealed their lack of a contractor’s
license.  (SAC ¶ 113.)  Defendants orally negligently misrepresented that
they would perform the design and construction within the standard of care for the
industry professionals.  (SAC ¶ 107.)  Defendants also orally negligently misrepresented
the country of origin and manufacturer price for the various materials used for
the construction project.  (SAC ¶ 109.)  Defendants knew the representations were false
and intended for Plaintiff to rely on the false representations when entering into
the service contracts.  (SAC ¶¶ 111-112.)  Plaintiff alleges that Defendants “acted with
malice, oppression, and/or fraud with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights
and welfare of Plaintiff.”  (SAC ¶ 114.)
These
allegations lack specific facts about how, when, where, to whom, and by what means
each misrepresentation was made.  (See Lazar,
supra, 12 Cal.4th at p. 645.)  Plaintiff
alleges both misrepresentation and concealment regarding contractors’ licenses.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendants negligently
misrepresented certain facts, but they also intentionally deceived Plaintiff such
that they may be liable for punitive damages. 
Plaintiff still does not allege who made certain misrepresentations on behalf
of the entity, Deyuan.  This cause of action
is therefore uncertain and lacking the required particularity.
The
demurrers are SUSTAINED with 30 days’ leave to amend.
MOTIONS
TO STRIKE
The
court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion: (1) strike out any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any
part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of California,
a court rule, or an order of the court.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 436, subds. (a)-(b).)
Defendants
move to strike the SAC’s ninth cause of action “because Plaintiff in bad faith once
again failed to honor California standard for pleading a fraud case(We comprehensively
discussed it in Defendant’s demurrer to Second amended complaint).”  This is duplicative of the demurrers.
The
motions to strike are DENIED AS MOOT.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
