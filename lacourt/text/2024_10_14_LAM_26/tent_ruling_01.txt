  Case Number:  22STCV27553    Hearing Date:   October 14, 2024    Dept:  26 TENTATIVE RULING:
The motion of Defendant Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District
(“Defendant”) for leave to file a Cross-Complaint is granted.  The Court finds that granting leave is in the
interest of justice (Code Civ. Proc. § 428.50, subdivision (c)) and in
furtherance of justice (Id. § 473, subdivision (a)(1)).  There is no trial date, and including the
cross-defendants and cross-claims in the action will promote efficiency and
prompt allocation of responsibility for Plaintiffs’ alleged damages.  There will be no material prejudice to
Plaintiffs.  
Both parties mistakenly rely on case authority that relates
only to motions for leave to file compulsory cross-complaints.  Defendant relies exclusively on Silver
Organization Ltd. v. Frank (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 94.  The Silver court stated expressly: “We
emphasize that our opinion deals solely with the denial of a compulsory
cross-complaint, which, if not pleaded within the action initiated by the
complaint will result in a forfeiture of the related causes of action.  Amendments to add non-compulsory causes of
action are governed by section 473.”  Id.
at 101 n.2 (emphasis in original).  Both Gherman
v. Colburn (1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 544, and Foot’s Transfer & Storage
Co. v. Superior Court (1980) 114 Cal.App.3d 897, similarly address only
leave to plead a compulsory cross-complaint.
Defendant’s proposed cross-claims for equitable indemnity
and equitable contribution are non-compulsory, both because they are not
causes of action against the plaintiffs (Code Civ. Proc. § 426.30) and because neither
cause of action actually accrues until Defendant has suffered actual loss
through payment (People ex rel. Dept. of Transportation v. Superior Court
(1980) 26 Cal.3d 744, 751).
The Court has considered the parties’ respective arguments
with respect to “bad faith” as relevant to the determination whether granting
leave is in the interest of justice, and the Court concludes that it is.
