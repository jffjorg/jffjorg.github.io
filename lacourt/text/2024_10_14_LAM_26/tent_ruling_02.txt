 Case Number:  23STCV06189    Hearing Date:   October 14, 2024    Dept:  26 TENTATIVE RULING:
The proof of service for Cross-Defendants’ Notice of
Demurrer and Demurrer to John Estrella’s Amended Cross-Complaint shows that Mr.
Estrella was served by mail at two addresses: 
255 N. D Street, Ste. 401-E; and 505 N. Arrowhead Ave., Ste 107.  The proof of service also shows he was emailed
the documents at virginia.wins@yahoo.com,
but it does not appear that Mr. Estrella has consented to electronic
service.  It is also not clear to the
Court where the email address was found.
The addresses for Mr. Estrella on the proof of service appear
to be incorrect.  The address on his
original cross-complaint, filed October 24, 2023, is 505 N. Arrowhead Ave., Suite
105 (not 107); and the address on his amended cross-complaint, filed March
13, 2024, is 255 N. D Street, Suite 219 (not 401-E).  The declaration of Cross-Defendants’ counsel
shows that counsel sent the meet-and-confer documents to the correct suite
number on North D Street, but the Demurrer itself was not sent to that address.
It is possible that Mr. Estrella received the Demurrer
notwithstanding the incorrect addresses, but the Court cannot assume that to be
the case, especially given that he has not filed any response to the Demurrer.  Accordingly, the Court’s tentative is to continue
the hearing on the Demurrer and require that proper service on Mr. Estrella be
effected.
