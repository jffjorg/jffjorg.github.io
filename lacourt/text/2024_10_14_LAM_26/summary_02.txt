And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a hearing on a demurrer (a legal challenge) filed by Cross-Defendants. The demurrer was served on John Estrella, the plaintiff, by mail and email, but the addresses used may be incorrect. The court is concerned that Estrella may not have received the demurrer despite the attempts to serve him. As a result, the court is tentatively ruling to continue the hearing and require that proper service be made on Estrella before proceeding further.
