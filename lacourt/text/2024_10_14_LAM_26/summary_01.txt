And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District (Defendant) has filed a motion to file a Cross-Complaint. The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion is granted. The judge finds that granting leave is in the interest of justice and will promote efficiency and prompt allocation of responsibility for the alleged damages. The judge also notes that the parties mistakenly rely on case authority that only relates to compulsory cross-complaints. The judge concludes that the proposed cross-claims for equitable indemnity and equitable contribution are non-compulsory and will not cause material prejudice to the plaintiffs. The judge has considered the parties' arguments regarding "bad faith" and concludes that granting leave is in the interest of justice.
