And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to dismiss the action, which was filed on October 10, 2024. The defendant argued that the action should be dismissed because the summons and complaint were not served on them within three years of the action being filed. However, the judge found that the defendant was not named in the original complaint filed on December 2, 2019, and was only added to the action through a first amended complaint filed on December 20, 2021. The judge ruled that the action was commenced against the defendant at the time the amended complaint was filed, and that the service of the summons and complaint on June 21, 2023, was within the three-year time period. The judge also cited case law to support the conclusion that the defendant was brought into the action as a new defendant at the time the amended complaint was filed, and that the action was therefore not time-barred.
