  CASE NO.: 24STCV18631
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
November 26, 2024



 
Michael
A. Klitzke and Auto Law Firm PC, counsel of record for Plaintiff Deidra Palmore,
seek to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s
declaration states that there is a complete breakdown in communication such that
it is impossible to adequately represent Plaintiff.  A further conflict of interest has arisen between
attorney and client, which has resulted in the breakdown of the attorney-client
relationship.  Plaintiff’s interests would
be prejudiced if counsel was forced to continue litigating this matter.  No party opposed the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Trial has not yet been set, and there is no prejudice
to Plaintiff.
The
unopposed motion to be relieved is GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 order and this order on Deidra
Palmore and all parties who have appeared.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 26th day of November 2024
