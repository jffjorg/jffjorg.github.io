[TENTATIVE] ORDER CONTINUING MOTION TO COMPEL
  FURTHER RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
November 26, 2024



 
On
November 29, 2023, Plaintiff Eduardo Sotelo filed this action against Defendant
Nissan North America, Inc.
On
March 22, 2024, Plaintiff served Requests for Production, Set One on Defendant.  On May 16, 2024, Defendant provided responses.  The parties agreed to extend Plaintiff’s deadline
to file his motion to compel to October 30, 2024.
On
October 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel further responses to Requests
for Production, Set One.
A
party may move to compel a further response to a demand for production of documents
if the demanding party deems that the statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete; the representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete,
or evasive; or an objection in the response is without merit or too general.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)  The motion must set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).)
For
a motion to compel further, the moving party must meet and confer with the opposing
party and file a Separate Statement or follow the Court’s alternative method of
outlining the disputes.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (b); California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b).)  This Department requires the parties to follow
the procedures outlined in Exhibit A of Department 48’s Courtroom Information (available
on the Court’s website, www.lacourt.org) and file a joint statement.
Plaintiff’s
declaration and separate statement make clear that he did not attempt to follow
these procedures.  After Defendant stated
on September 27, 2024 that it would respond to meet-and-confer letters by October
11, 2024, Plaintiff made no further attempts to contact Defendant before filing
this motion.  (Gibson Decl. ¶¶ 20-22.)  The Court will continue the hearing on this motion
so the parties may meet and confer and follow the proper procedures.
The
Hearing on Motion to Compel Further Discovery Responses to Plaintiff's Request for
Production of Documents, Set One is CONTINUED to February 13, 2025 at 8:30 a.m.
The
parties are ordered to meet and confer in good faith.  For any unresolved issues, they are ordered to
prepare a Joint Statement (in accordance with the procedures outlined in Exhibit
A of Department 48’s Courtroom Information) no later than February 3, 2025.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
