And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a motion by Michael A. Klitzke, counsel for Deidra Palmore, to be relieved as counsel. This decision was made due to a complete breakdown in communication between Klitzke and Palmore, resulting in a conflict of interest between the two. As there is no opposition to the motion and no prejudice to Palmore, the judge has granted the motion and relieved Klitzke as counsel. The judge has ordered that a proof of service showing service of the order on Palmore and all parties who have appeared must be filed. The judge has also indicated that if all parties submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the court are required unless a companion hearing is also on calendar.
