The judge has granted the motions of the defendants' counsel, Dariush G. Adli and Vernon A. Nelson, to be relieved as counsel. The counsel's relationship with the defendants has ceased due to irreconcilable differences, and there is no opposition to the motions. The judge has scheduled an Order to Show Cause for February 3, 2025, requiring the defendants to retain new counsel by that date or risk having their answers struck and being placed in default. The judge has also granted the motions, effective upon filing a proof of service showing service of the orders on the defendants and all parties who have appeared.
