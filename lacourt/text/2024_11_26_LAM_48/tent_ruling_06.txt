  CASE NO.: 24STCV06843
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
November 26, 2024



 
The
Law Offices of Bob Khakshooy, counsel of record for Plaintiff Iridiam Menez Lozano,
seeks to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s
declaration states that they are unable to locate and communicate with the client
and therefore are unable to effectively represent Plaintiff’s interests.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Trial has not yet been set, and there is no prejudice
to Plaintiff.
The
unopposed motion to be relieved is GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 order and this order on Iridiam
Menez Lozano and all parties who have appeared.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
