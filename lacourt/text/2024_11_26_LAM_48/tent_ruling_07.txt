[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANTS’ MOTIONS
  TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO INTERROGATORIES
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
November 26, 2024



 
On March 25, 2024, Plaintiffs
Amran Noorzay and Ahmad Ibrahimi filed this action against Defendant Kia America
Inc.
On
September 20, 2024, Defendant served Special Interrogatories, Set Two.  Plaintiffs did not serve responses.  Plaintiffs later agreed to a two-week extension
on Defendant's motion to compel filing deadline, extending the deadline to November
7, 2024.
On
October 30, 2024, Defendant filed motions to compel Plaintiffs’ responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set Two.
Where
a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make
an order compelling responses.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)   A party that fails to serve timely responses
waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection
of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).)
Plaintiffs’
counsel served responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Two on November 8, 2024.  (Lee Decl. ¶ 7.)  However, the responses are not verified.  (Lee Decl., Ex. 1; Reply at p. 2.)  “Unsworn responses are tantamount to no responses
at all.”  (Appleton v. Superior Court
(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)
Accordingly,
the motions are GRANTED.
Plaintiffs
are each ordered to provide verified responses, without objections, to Interrogatories,
Set Two within 30 days.
The
request for sanctions is denied.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
