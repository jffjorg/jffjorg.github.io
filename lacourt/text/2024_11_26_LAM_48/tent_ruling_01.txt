[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTION TO DISMISS
  ACTION
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
November 26, 2024



 
On
December 2, 2019, Plaintiff Ashley S. Aarons (individually and as Trustee of the
Ashley S. Aarons 2015 Trust Dated May 15, 2015) filed this action.
On
December 20, 2021, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint (“FAC”) that included
Defendant Maria Cecilia S. Doratan for the first time.[1]
On
October 10, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the action for failure to
serve her within three years of the action being filed.
The
summons and complaint must be served on a defendant within three years after the
action is commenced against the defendant. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 583.210, subd. (a). 
An action is commenced at the time the complaint is filed.  (Ibid.)  If service is not made within the required time
period, the action shall not be further prosecuted and shall be dismissed by the
court on its own motion or on motion.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 583.250, subd. (a).)
Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant was deeded the subject property on January 28, 2020, and
Plaintiff was wrongfully deprived of possession sometime after.  (FAC ¶¶ 205, 303.)  Therefore, Defendant could not have been named
as a defendant in the original December 2, 2019 complaint because the underlying
events for the new cause of action for wrongful eviction had not yet occurred.  “[W]here the amended complaint is based on different
operative facts, the defendant does not become a party until the date of filing
the amendment.”  (Barrington v. A. H. Robins
Co. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 146, 154.)
Additionally,
for all causes of action, Defendant is alleged to be an alter ego of the other defendants.  “When a defendant is first named in an amended
complaint, and is alleged to be the alter ego of a defendant named in the original
complaint, he is brought into the action as a new defendant and the action is commenced
as to him at the time the amended complaint naming him is filed.”  (Hennessey’s Tavern, Inc. v. American Air Filter
Co. (1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 1351, 1359.)
Plaintiff
filed a proof of service reflecting substituted service of the summons and FAC on
Defendant on June 21, 2023.  This service
was within three years of Plaintiff’s December 20, 2021 FAC, when this action was
commenced against this Defendant.
Accordingly,
the motion to dismiss is DENIED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
