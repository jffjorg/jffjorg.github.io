The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to enforce a settlement agreement. The agreement was entered on August 9, 2024, and the judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiff for $23,250.00. The plaintiff claims that the defendants breached the settlement agreement by failing to satisfy the stipulated judgment within 15 days. The judge states that there is nothing additional for the court to enforce, as the judgment has already been entered, and the court cannot enter a second judgment for the same amount. The plaintiff's remedy lies with post-judgment enforcement proceedings, not a motion to enforce a settlement that has already been rendered to a final judgment.
