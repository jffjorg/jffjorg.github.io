And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the unopposed motion to be relieved as counsel filed by The Law Offices of Bob Khakshooy, representing Plaintiff Iridiam Menez Lozano. The reason for the request is that counsel is unable to locate and communicate with the client and therefore cannot effectively represent the plaintiff's interests. The judge finds that, absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney's request for withdrawal should be granted. The motion complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative ruling must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit. If all parties submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the court are required unless a companion hearing is also on calendar.
