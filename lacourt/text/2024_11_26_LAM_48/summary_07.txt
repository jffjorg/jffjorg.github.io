And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motions to compel responses to special interrogatories, set two. The plaintiffs, Amran Noorzay and Ahmad Ibrahimi, failed to serve timely responses to the interrogatories, despite agreeing to a two-week extension on the filing deadline. The defendant, Kia America, Inc., filed motions to compel responses, which the court has granted. The judge has ordered the plaintiffs to provide verified responses, without objections, to the interrogatories within 30 days. The request for sanctions is denied.
