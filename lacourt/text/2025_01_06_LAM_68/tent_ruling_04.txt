 Case Number:  24STCV10879    Hearing Date:   January 6, 2025    Dept:  68 Dept. 68Date: 1-6-25Case #: 24STCV10879Trial Date: 8-25-25PMQ DEPOSITIONMOVING PARTY: Plaintiff, Francisco DenizRESPONDING PARTY: Defendant, General Motors LLCRELIEF REQUESTEDMotion to Compel the PMQ DepositionSUMMARY OF ACTIONPlaintiff Francisco Deniz alleges a General Motors vehicle suffers from defects in the engine monitoring systems as well as the transmission, side mirrors and “erratic noises” from underneath the vehicle. On May 1, 2024, plaintiff filed a complaint against General Motors LLC (GM) for Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act – Breach of Implied and Express Warranty. GM answered on June 11, 2024.RULING: Granted.Plaintiff Francisco Deniz moves to compel the deposition of the person most qualified (PMQ), 15 categories, and 12 requests for production. Plaintiff served a notice of deposition for the PMQ, and attempted to meet and confer, but alleges Defendant General Motors LLC (GM) refuses to produce witness(es) and objects to the categories. GM in opposition states it already produced responsive documents; agreed to a deposition at a mutually agreed upon time and place; challenges the adequacy of the meet and confer before filing the instant motion; and, maintains the remaining objections are well founded. Plaintiff in reply emphasizes the sufficiency of the meet and confer effort and contends Defendant refused to cooperate, and good cause exists for production, in that the sought after information is relevant. Plaintiff challenges the sufficiency of the objections and also notes Defendant never sought a protective order.A party may file a motion to compel deposition upon a non-appearance of the noticed party. (Code Civ. Proc., §2025.450, subd. (a).) A party must present a qualified person for each deposition. (Maldonado v. Superior Court (2002) 94 Cal.App.4th 1390, 1398.) No attempted deposition occurred, due to the lack of a coordinated effort to agree upon a date. [Declaration of Elizabeth Quinn.]The court presents its policy on discovery involving Song-Beverly Act (SBA) litigation. Given the increasing volume of filed SBA “Lemon Law” cases and the subsequent increase of motions, presumably at least in part prompted by the lack of arbitration clause enforcement pending California Supreme Court review, the court established certain discovery standards based on the fundamental basis for SBA. Under the SBA, “[a] plaintiff pursuing an action under the Act has the burden to prove that (1) the vehicle had a nonconformity covered by the express warranty that substantially impaired the use, value or safety of the vehicle (the nonconformity element); (2) the vehicle was presented to an authorized representative of the manufacturer of the vehicle for repair (the presentation element); and (3) the manufacturer or his representative did not repair the nonconformity after a reasonable number of repair attempts (the failure to repair element).(Civ.Code, § 1793.2; Ibrahim v. Ford Motor Co. (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 878, 886–887, 263 Cal.Rptr. 64.)” (Oregel v. American Isuzu Motors, Inc. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)The court adheres to a discovery approach allowing inquiry into the relevant make and model year for all impacted systems or parts, without opening the door for a general inquiry into any and all lemon law claims filed against vehicle manufacturers for all makes and models, including varying individual and potential system defects. The goal strives for a goal of facilitating robust adjudication of the case on the subject vehicle, thereby allowing Plaintiff the opportunity to investigate, without imposing any burden on defendant to determine the cause of the purported defect(s).The court established this policy based on established practice standards common among counsel in this field based on standards established and reviewed by practice and reviewed at least in party by appellate courts. (Donlen v. Ford Motor Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 138, 153-154; Oregel v. American Isuzu Motors, Inc. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1104-1105.) The court in no way doctrinally adheres to this policy. No doubt other courts may take different approaches. The court in no way seeks to invite comparisons with other courtrooms. The court only notes its reasoning behind its policy to experienced counsel.Given the agreement to produce a witness, the court grants the motion in order to compel compliance as to the subject items. On category numbers 1, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, the court finds the objections on grounds of relevance, and overbroad and burdensome lacking support. (Cruz v. Superior Court (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 646, 653–654; West Pico Furniture Co. v. Sup. Ct. (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417-418.) The court finds the items are properly limited to the make, model, and year and the operating system(s). On category number 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, discovery is limited to technical service bulletins regarding the alleged defects, as opposed to each any and item on unrelated items, if applicable. (Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 224–225.) The motion is GRANTED as to these items subject to meet and confer on the latter identified set.On the requests for production, consistent with the categories, the court limits discovery to the relevant operating system(s), as applicable, on numbers 1, 3, 4, and grants production on numbers 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 11, and 12. The motion is GRANTED as to these items subject to meet and confer on the latter identified set.The motion is therefore granted in order to insure the PMQ deposition(s) occur(s), along with relevant documents production. The court orders the parties to meet and confer within 10 days of this order to agree upon a mutually convenient deposition date(s) of the PMQ(s) to occur within 15 days of the lapsed meet and confer deadline.Defendant may assert any privilege objections at the time of the deposition, as it deems required. An excessive amount of objections and/or termination of the deposition may allow Plaintiff to file a motion to compel further deposition testimony and/or production. Such a motion will require a trial continuance, with a potential additional setting of an OSC for referral to a discovery referee in order to conduct a supervised deposition and/or document review with authority to make privilege determinations, as well as the right to award sanctions in favor of the prevailing party.Plaintiff makes no request for sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., §2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)Trial remain set for August 25, 2024.Plaintiff to give notice.
