Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel compliance with a subpoena for the production of an unredacted police report investigation into defendant Howard Cheung. The report is protected under Penal Code section 11167.5, which prohibits the disclosure of reports of suspected child abuse or neglect except in limited circumstances. The court finds that the plaintiff has not demonstrated a sufficient basis for compelling the disclosure of the report, despite the alleged relevance of the report to the plaintiff's claims. The court also notes that the investigation into the alleged child abuse is ongoing, and that the disclosure of the report could jeopardize the investigation. The court declines to order an in camera review of the file to determine whether any information could be safely disclosed to the plaintiff.
