Failure To Engage In A Good Faith Interactive Process In Violation Of Govt. Code §12940(N); and 8. Defamation.On August 22, 2024, the court denied the special motion to strike the first amended complaint brought by City of Redondo Beach. On November 7, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed “Redondo Beach Police Department” without prejudice. On December 17, 2024, the court granted the motion to strike the claim for punitive damages against Defendant City of Redondo Beach with prejudice/without leave to amend.RULING: Sustained with Leave to Amend.Defendant Diane Strickfaden submits a demurrer to the fifth cause of action for Harassment (Government Code section 12940(j)) in the first amended complaint. Defendant challenges the cause of action on grounds of uncertainty. Plaintiff in opposition counters the subject cause of action is well pled. Defendant in reply reiterates the lack of facts supporting the claim for harassment, and requests a denial for leave to amend.A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law . . . .” ’ ” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the court liberally construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action has been stated. (Picton v. Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 726, 733.)“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616; Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139 [“[U]nder our liberal pleading rules, where the complaint contains substantive factual allegations sufficiently apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet, a demurrer for uncertainty should be overruled or plaintiff given leave to amend.]Plaintiff brings the subject claim under Government Code section 12940, subdivision (j) which provides in relevant part:For an employer, labor organization, employment agency, apprenticeship training program or any training program leading to employment, or any other person, because of race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual orientation, reproductive health decisionmaking or veteran or military status, to harass an employee, an applicant, an unpaid intern or volunteer, or a person providing services pursuant to a contract. Harassment of an employee, an applicant, an unpaid intern or volunteer, or a person providing services pursuant to a contract by an employee, other than an agent or supervisor, shall be unlawful if the entity, or its agents or supervisors, knows or should have known of this conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. An employer may also be responsible for the acts of nonemployees, with respect to harassment of employees, applicants, unpaid interns or volunteers, or persons providing services pursuant to a contract in the workplace, if the employer, or its agents or supervisors, knows or should have known of the conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. In reviewing cases involving the acts of nonemployees, the extent of the employer's control and any other legal responsibility that the employer may have with respect to the conduct of those nonemployees shall be considered. An entity shall take all reasonable steps to prevent harassment from occurring. Loss of tangible job benefits shall not be necessary in order to establish harassment.(2) The provisions of this subdivision are declaratory of existing law, except for the new duties imposed on employers with regard to harassment.(3) An employee of an entity subject to this subdivision is personally liable for any harassment prohibited by this section that is perpetrated by the employee, regardless of whether the employer or covered entity knows or should have known of the conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action.Gov. Code, § 12940Strickfaden cites to the sexual harassment standard, but the court addresses said case for purposes of determining a hostile work environment. “Whether the sexual conduct complained of is sufficiently pervasive to create a hostile or offensive work environment must be determined from the totality of the circumstances. (Citation.) The plaintiff must prove that the defendant's conduct would have interfered with a reasonable employee's7 work performance and would have seriously affected the psychological well-being of a reasonable employee and that she was actually offended.” [¶] “The factors that can be considered in evaluating the totality of the circumstances are: (1) the nature of the unwelcome sexual acts or works (generally, physical touching is more offensive than unwelcome verbal abuse); (2) the frequency of the offensive encounters; (3) the total number of days over which all of the offensive conduct occurs; and (4) the context in which the sexually harassing conduct occurred.” [¶] “In determining what constitutes “sufficiently pervasive” harassment, the courts have held that acts of harassment cannot be occasional, isolated, sporadic, or trivial, rather the plaintiff must show a concerted pattern of harassment of a repeated, routine or a generalized nature.” (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 590, 609–610.)More specifically, Strickfadden depends on a finding that the alleged conduct constituted conduct within supervisory duties, and therefore not harassment. “[H]arassment consists of a type of conduct not necessary for performance of a supervisory job. Instead, harassment consists of conduct outside the scope of necessary job performance, conduct presumably engaged in for personal gratification, because of meanness or bigotry, or for other personal motives. Harassment is not conduct of a type necessary for management of the employer's business or performance of the supervisory employee's job.” (Janken v. GM Hughes Electronics (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 55, 63.)The potential liability of Strickfadden as a supervisor not disputed. The operative complaint only cites to the elements. The factual allegations common to all causes of action provides the factual basis for the claim arising from the post-cancer recovery treatment regimen and request for accommodation as a member of a protected class of employee. Plaintiff specifically alleges denial of accommodation and being singled out as not taking an excessive amount of time away to the burden of fellow coworkers. [First Amend. Comp., ¶¶ 22-23.]The court agrees the sparse allegations regarding denial of accommodation in no way supports a finding of harassment, which leaves the single paragraph regarding the creation of an unpleasant work environment caused by the circumstances. It remains unclear as to the nexus between any individual supervisor directing such conduct and/or employees alternatively making their own conclusions. While the court normally favors discovery where a claim presents a threshold basis of support, the subject single allegation insufficiently articulates the claim for purposes of withstanding scrutiny under the standard. (Janken v. GM Hughes Electronics, supra, 46 Cal.App.4th at p. 63.) The court therefore sustains the demurrer to the harassment cause of action with leave to amend. The court otherwise declines to consider the redundancy discussion, but notes a party may plead in the alternative. (Third Eye Blind, Inc. v. Near North EntertainmentInsurance Services, LLC (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1311, 1323; Rader Co. v. Stone (1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 10, 29.)Plaintiff is given 60 days leave to amend in order to allow a single amended pleading following the final set of demurrers currently on calendar for January 27, 2025. Plaintiff may NOT add any new causes of action. (Harris v. Wachovia Mortgage, FSB (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1018, 1023.) Any such actions will be subject to a motion to strike. If Plaintiff elects to forego filing a second amended complaint, moving Defendant is ordered to answer the remaining cause of action within 10 days of the lapsed amendment deadline. Plaintiff may alternatively elect to file an amended complaint prior to any and all upcoming demurrers.Next demurrer scheduled for January 8, 2025, also only applies to the fifth cause of action, and is therefore MOOT. The court therefore takes the January 8, 2025, demurrer off-calendar. The demurrers for January 27, 2025, will remain on calendar, unless Plaintiff elects to file an amended complaint on or before the opposition due date. (Code Civ. Proc., 472, subd. (a).)Defendant to provide notice.
