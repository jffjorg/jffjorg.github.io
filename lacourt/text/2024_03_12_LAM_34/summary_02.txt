The tentative ruling grants the motion for an order to charge the judgment debtor's interests in three limited liability companies: 7851 Holdings, LLC; Comet Hyesung, LLC; and Chung Soonkyo, LLC. The motion was filed by Judgment Creditors United Escrow Co. and Tracy Ko, who intend to satisfy a judgment debt of $307,776.00. The judgment debtor, Caroline S. Lee, has not opposed the motion, and the Court has not been presented with evidence that the judgment has been satisfied. The Court finds that the judgment creditors have satisfied the legal requirements for a charging order, and therefore grants the motion.
