```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for determination of good faith settlement and dismissal of complaint filed by the defendants, Compass California, Inc. and Angelo Fierro. The motion was opposed by the non-settling defendant, Gelfand, Rennert, Feldman, LLP, who argued that the settlement was not made in good faith and prejudices all non-settling defendants.

The judge analyzed the evidence and filings submitted and found that the settlement was entered into in good faith. The judge considered the factors set forth in Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, including the rough approximation of the plaintiff's total recovery and the settlor's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and a recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than he would if he were found liable after a trial.

The judge also considered the evidence that the settlement was negotiated directly with the plaintiff's counsel, involved multiple back-and-forth communications, and was not meant to be collusive. The judge found that the settlement meets the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6 and was entered into in good faith.
