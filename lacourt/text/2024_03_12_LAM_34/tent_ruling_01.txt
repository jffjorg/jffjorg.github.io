II.       Legal
Standard
 
“Any party to an action in which it
is alleged that two or more parties are joint tortfeasors or co-obligors on a
contract debt shall be entitled to a hearing on the issue of the good faith of
a settlement entered into by the plaintiff or other claimant and one or more
alleged tortfeasors or co-obligors, upon giving notice in the manner provided
in subdivision (b) of Section 1005.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 877.6, subd. (a)(1).)
 
“In the alternative, a settling
party may give notice of settlement to all parties and to the court, together
with an application for determination of good faith settlement and a proposed
order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 877.6, subd.
(a)(2).)
 
“The issue of the good faith of a
settlement may be determined by the court on the basis of affidavits served
with the notice of hearing, and any counteraffidavits filed in response, or the
court may, in its discretion, receive other evidence at the hearing.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 877.6, subd. (b).)
 
III.     Discussion
 
A.      The
Parties’ Arguments
 
Settling Defendants move the Court to
determine that a settlement made between them and Plaintiff 23 Courtington
Trust was made in good faith pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6.
(Motion, pp. 5:9–10, 9:12–16.)
 
Non-Settling Defendant opposes the Motion,
arguing: (1) that the settlement is not in good faith and prejudices all
non-settling defendants, who have legitimate grievances with settling
defendants that will remain unaccounted for it the settlement is confirmed; (2)
that Settling Defendants have not adequately explained the settlement amount;
(3) that Settling Defendants’ liability far outweighs their proposed settlement
value; (4) that the settlement was not reached in an adversarial manner; (5)
that Settling Defendant’s liability and exposure is undisputed; (6) that the
financial conditions and insurance policy limits are unknown at this time as
discovery has not begun and the Motion provides no evidence on this factor; (7)
that there is evidence of collusion and/or tortious conduct aimed at all
non-setting defendants; and (8) that the Motion may be moot if an express
indemnity clause exists between Settling Defendants and Defendants Glenn Caron
and Zina Caron. (Opposition, pp. 14:21–22, 15:1–2, 15:17–18, 18:1, 18:24–25,
22:8–9, 23:14–15, 24:9–10.)
 
In their Reply, Settling Defendants argue:
(1) that Settling Defendants are entitled to a determination that their
settlement is in good faith; (2) that Settling Defendants meet the test set
forth in Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) 38
Cal.3d 488, with sub-arguments on each factor; (3) that the Motion is
sufficient; and (4) that Non-Settling Defendant has the burden to demonstrate
that the settlement was not made in good faith. 
 
B.      Discussion
 
The Parties both discuss the California
Supreme Court’s decision in Tech-Bilt, Inc., which states:
 
“[T]he intent and policies
underlying section 877.6 require that a number of factors be taken into
account including a rough approximation of plaintiffs' total recovery and the
settlor's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the
allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and a recognition that a
settlor should pay less in settlement than he would if he were found liable
after a trial. Other relevant considerations include the financial conditions
and insurance policy limits of settling defendants, as well as the existence of
collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of
nonsettling defendants. Finally, practical considerations obviously require
that the evaluation be made on the basis of information available at the time
of settlement. ‘[A] defendant's settlement figure must not be grossly
disproportionate to what a reasonable person, at the time of the settlement,
would estimate the settling defendant's liability to be.’ The party asserting
the lack of good faith, who has the burden of proof on that issue (§ 877.6,
subd. (d)), should be permitted to demonstrate, if he can, that the settlement
is so far ‘out of the ballpark’ in relation to these factors as to be
inconsistent with the equitable objectives of the statute. Such a
demonstration would establish that the proposed settlement was not a
‘settlement made in good faith’ within the terms of section 877.6.” (Tech-Bilt,
Inc., supra, 38 Cal.3d at pp. 499–500, citations omitted.)
 
        Here, the FAC states
liability against all defendants in the total amount of $112,153.81, plus late
charges that have been accruing at the annual rate of 5% since August 7, 2023,
as well as costs and attorney’s fees. (FAC, pp. 8:16–9:3.) The Settlement would
include a payment of $35,000.00 as a full and complete settlement for Settling
Defendants. (Motion, p. 5:3–8; Decl. Kraemer, Exh. 2, p. 1.) Even including the
amount of late charges that have already accrued at the annual rate stated,
this would cover approximately 30% of the damages claimed (not including fees
and costs). 
 
        Counsel for Settling
Defendants declares, among other things: (1) that Settling Defendants
negotiated a settlement directly with Plaintiff’s Counsel are being served with
the Complaint; (2) that the settlement involved multiple back-and-forth
communications, including offers and counteroffers; and (3) that none of the
terms of the settlement are meant to be collusive. (Decl. Kraemer, ¶¶ 6–8.)
 
        The Motion addresses the
other Tech-Bilt factors, arguing: (1) 
that the settlement approximates Settling Defendants’ pre-litigation
risk; (2) that their liability and damage exposure is disputed: (3) that all
the settlement proceeds are being allocated to Plaintiff; (4) that while they
do have insurance, their settlement meets the requirements of Code of Civil
Procedure section 877.6; and (5) that there was no collusion, fraud, or
tortious conduct aimed at injuring all the non-settling parties.
 
        After considering the
evidence and filings submitted, the Court agrees with Settling Parties’
arguments. The Court has not been provided with any evidence that would
indicate the settlement was not entered into in good faith. Nor has the Court
been presented with any evidence that would indicate collusive or tortious
conduct aimed at any of the non-settling parties. Rather, all of the evidence
indicates that the settlement was entered into in good faith. 
 
        In addition,
Non-Settling Defendant argues that Defendant Compass California, Inc. is “100%
liable for the situation in which [all non-settling defendants] find themselves
today.” (Opposition, p. 8:7–8.) The Court has found that it is not uncommon for
one defendant (whether or not they are settling) to disclaim all liability.  Of course, it will be up to the jury to
determine that question.  
 
        Finally,
Defendants Glenn Caron and Zina Caron have not opposed the Motion. Even if
there was an indemnity clause between them and Settling Defendants, that clause
would be waived by their non-opposition to the Motion. There is no evidence
that would indicate such a clause exists; as Non-Settling Defendant does not
know whether such a clause exists, it is doubtful that Non-Settling Defendant
is a third-party beneficiary of such a clause and has standing to invoke it.
 
The Court finds that the settlement was entered into good
faith. (Code Civ. Proc, § 877.6, subd. (b).) 
 
IV.      Conclusion
 
The Motion is GRANTED.
