And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the unopposed motion for leave to file a First Amended Answer (FAA) by CAA General Contractor, Inc. (CAA). The motion seeks to assert two additional affirmative defenses based on the doctrines of release and accord and satisfaction, which CAA believes were not available at the time it filed its original Answer. The judge has allowed the proposed amendment due to the lack of opposition and the liberality exercised in favor of amendments. The Court will allow CAA to file its proposed FAA within five days of the date of this Order.
