And here is the English-text summary:

Judge Michelle C. Kim has issued a tentative ruling denying without prejudice a motion by Defendant DMH Aesthetics, LLC's attorney, Farhad Novian, to be relieved as counsel. Counsel claims that a breakdown in attorney-client communications has occurred and that he has served DMH by mail at its last known address, which he confirmed as current within the last 30 days. However, the motion is denied because there is no accompanying proposed order on form MC-053 filed, nor any proof of service related to the proposed order. Counsel is ordered to give notice. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court. Unless all parties submit or appear at the hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.
