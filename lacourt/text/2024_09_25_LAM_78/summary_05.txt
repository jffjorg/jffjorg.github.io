And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to seal the settlement amount contained in the settlement agreement between the plaintiffs and the defendant. The plaintiffs seek to seal the settlement amount, while the defendant opposes the motion. The judge finds that the plaintiffs' request is overbroad and seeks to seal the entire motion, which goes beyond the purpose sought for its sealing. The judge orders the plaintiffs to submit a proposed redacted version of the motion that is narrowly tailored to serve the specific overriding interest. The defendant's application to seal its opposition to the motion to seal is denied because it is unnecessary, as the opposition already redacts the settlement amount. The judge continues the motion to seal the settlement amount to a future hearing date and orders the parties to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement.
