 Case Number:  23STCV08508    Hearing Date:   September 25, 2024    Dept:  78 DEPT:   78 OSC DATE:  09/25/2024 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  23STCV08508 ALVESTER WALKER vs WEST COAST SOUL, LLC, et al. REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  WEST COAST SOUL, LLC dba BLAQHAUS NOHO TENTATIVE RULING:  DISMISSAL of Plaintiff’s complaint.  TENTATIVE  Plaintiff Alvester Walker (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendants West Coast Soul, LLC dba Blaqhaus Noho (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 20 for damages arising from his employment with Defendant. The complaint sets forth nine causes of action for (1) retaliation (Lab. Code §98.6), (2) retaliation (Lab. Code §§102.5, 1102.6), (3)wrongful termination, (4) failure to pay wages, (5) failure to pay minimum wages, (6) failure to provide meal and rest periods, (7) waiting time penalties, (8) failure to permit inspection of personnel and payroll records, and (9) unfair competition.  On March 1, 2024, the Court denied Plaintiff’s application for default judgment filed on December 13, 2023, and advised Plaintiff’s counsel to file a revised default judgment.  On May 22, 2024, Plaintiff failed to submit a revised proposed default judgment form as requested in the March 1, 2024 Minute Order. The Court advised Plaintiff that if there was no appearance by Plaintiff on August 22, 2024 and no revised judgment had been submitted, that the Court intended to set aside the default and dismiss the case.  On August 22, 2024, the Court denied Plaintiff’s revised application for default judgment filed on June 24, 2024 for failure to fully cure the previously noted deficiencies. The Court placed Plaintiff on notice that if a corrected default judgment package was not submitted at least 5 court days in advance of the next court date, that the Court intended on dismissing the entire action. The Court then scheduled an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal For Failure To Submit And Obtain Default Judgment for September 25, 2024.  Pursuant to the Court’s August 22, 2024 Order, the corrected default package was therefore due no later than September 18, 2024. To date, no default package nor any other documents have been filed by Plaintiff since the date of that Order.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s action is hereby DISMISSED.
