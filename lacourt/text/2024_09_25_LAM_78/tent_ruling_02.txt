 Case Number:  22STCV33659    Hearing Date:   September 25, 2024    Dept:  78  Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78 ¿ GROVER HENRY COLIN NIX, IV, Plaintiff(s), vs. JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, et al., Defendant(s). Case No.: 22STCV33659 Hearing Date: September 25, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTION FOR ATTORNEY FEES  I.  BACKGROUND Plaintiffs Grover Henry Colin Nix IV, and Grover Henry Nix III, Trustee of Soames Lane Trust (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against defendants JPMorgan Chase Bank, Wilmington Trust, N.A., Structured Asset Mortgage Investment II Trust 2007-AR7, Inc., and Wells Fargo & Company for allegations arising from a wrongful foreclosure of residential real property commonly known as 2651 Aberdeen Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90027 (“the Property”). On July 5, 2024, Wilmington Trust, N.A. as Trustee for Structured Asset Mortgage Investments II Trust 2007-AR7 Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates 2007-AR7 (“Defendant”) filed the instant motion for attorney fees pursuant to the provisions of the Note and Deed of Trust at issue in this matter. At this juncture, all named parties to the action have been dismissed. On September 12, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their opposition. On September 18, 2024, Defendant filed its reply.  II.  REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE Defendant requests the Court take judicial notice of (1) The Deed of Trust recorded on June 28, 2007, in the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office, bearing instrument number 20071552455, (2) The Corporate Assignment of Deed of Trust recorded on October 15, 2012, in the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office, bearing instrument number 20121553807, (3) The Resignation, Successor Appointment and Acceptance Agreement effective December 3, 2012, (4) The Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale recorded on December 19, 2022, in the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office, bearing instrument number 20221181523, (5) Minute Order filed June 13, 2023 in the instant matter, (6) Minute Order filed August 2, 2023 in the instant matter, (7) Notice of Ruling filed April 29, 2024 in the instant matter, and (8) Notice of Entry of Judgment filed May 6, 2024 in the instant matter. Requests 1 to 4 are GRANTED. (Cal. Evid. Code § 452(d), (h).) The court “may take judicial notice of the fact of a document’s recordation, the date the document was recorded and executed, the parties to the transaction reflected in a recorded document, and the document’s legally operative language….¿ From this, the court may deduce and rely upon the legal effect of the recorded document, when that effect is clear from its face.” (Fontenot v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 256, 265, disapproved on other grounds by Yvanova v. New Century Mortg. Corp. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 919, 939.)¿ Requests 5 to 8 are GRANTED. (Cal. Evid. Code § 452(d).)  III.  LEGAL STANDARD “Except as attorney's fees are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the parties; but parties to actions or proceedings are entitled to their costs, as hereinafter provided.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1021.) “In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated to not suffice.” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488, quoting Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Ass’n (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) The Court has discretion to reduce fees that result from inefficient or duplicative use of time. (Horsford v. Bd. of Trustees of California State Univ. (2005) 132 Cal. App. 4th 359, 395.) In determining a reasonable attorney fee, the trial court begins with the lodestar, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24, 36.)  IV.  DISCUSSION This action filed by Plaintiffs against Defendant arises from the foreclosure of the Property following Plaintiffs’ default on a loan. Defendant moves for attorney fees on grounds that it is the prevailing party in this action and attorney fees are contractually authorized under the promissory note secured by a deed of trust recorded against the Property of this action. “Except as attorney's fees are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the parties; but parties to actions or proceedings are entitled to their costs, as hereinafter provided.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1021.)  Here, the Deed of Trust executed by Plaintiff Colin Nix and recorded against the Property includes the following provisions:  “Lender may charge Borrower fees for services performed in connection with Borrower’s default, for purposes of protecting Lender’s interest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument, including, but not limited to attorneys’ fees, property inspection and valuation fees.” (RJN 1 at ¶14.) “If the default is not cured on or before the date specified in the notice, Lender at its option may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument without further demand and may invoke the power of sale and any other remedies permitted by Applicable Law. Lender shall be entitled to collect all expenses incurred in pursuing the remedies provided in this Section 22, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of title evidence.” (RJN 1 at ¶22.) Further, the Note provides as follows: “If the Note Holder has required me to pay immediately in full as described above, the Note Holder will have the right to be paid back by me for all of its costs and expenses in enforcing this Note to the extent not prohibited by applicable law. Those expenses include, for example, reasonable attorneys' fees.” (SAC, Ex. A at ¶ 6(E).) 1 On May 1, 2024, judgment was entered in favor of defendants Wilmington Trust, N.A. as Trustee for Structured Asset Mortgage Investments II Trust 2007-AR7 Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates 2007-AR7 following the sustaining of the demurrer to Plaintiff’s SAC without leave to amend. There is no dispute that Defendant is the prevailing party. Plaintiffs’ only contention against the propriety of attorney fees is that Plaintiffs’ action arose in tort and not for breach of contract. Plaintiffs’ opposition, in sum, lacks substance and fails to make any specific arguments with supporting authority. As pointed out by Defendant in reply, the focus is not whether an action is “on the contract”, but on the basis of the cause of action. (Kachlon v. Markowitz (2008) 168 Cal. App. 4th 316, 347.) Here, Plaintiffs sought the reconveyance of the Property to Plaintiff Colin Nix based on allegations challenging the foreclosure sale of the Property pursuant to the Deed of Trust. Like in Kachlon, "[A]lthough the remedy sought in the relevant causes of action was equitable, the claims were still actions “on the contract,” i.e., the note and deed of trust."  Because Defendant is the prevailing party, and because the subject Deed of Trust and Note each include a provision awarding attorneys’ fees related to default of the loan and related to protection of the lender’s interest, the Defendant is entitled to recover their attorneys’ fees in this action. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1021.) The Court awards reasonable attorneys’ fees according to the lodestar.¿(See PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1096; see also Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) Here, Defendant’s counsel sets forth their firm’s billable rates in this matter, which range between $335.00 to $395.00 per hour. The Court finds the rates to be more than reasonable, especially compared to the rates billed in the local market which are in excess. Defendant’s counsel attests that they incurred attorney fees in the total amount of $68,130.50, calculated as follows: “Wilmington's counsel spent a total of 27.6 hours of attorney time at $335.00/hour (which was the Partner hourly rate in this matter until January 1, 2023, when it increased to $395.00/hour), .2 hours of attorney time at $345.00/hour, and 148.9 hours of attorney time at $395.00/hour. The work was primarily performed by me (167.1 hours as of May 31, 2024), though my Partners, Gwen Ribar (8 hours as of May 31, 2024), Robin Wright (.4 hours), and Nick Hood (.2 hours) also had some involvement.” (Fink Decl. ¶ 6; Exh. 9.) Mr. Fink further attests that although the June 2024 bill has not yet been finalized, he spent another 6.3 hours at $395.00/hour on this matter and spent 12.8 hours at $395.00/hour on this Motion. (Ibid.) Mr. Fink declares he anticipates an additional 10 hours at $395.00/hour to review any opposition, draft a reply, and appear at the hearing on this Motion. Thus, Defendant seeks $79,625.00 as attorney fees collectively. Plaintiffs fail to make any specific arguments contesting the reasonableness of the rates or expenditure of time. The Court has reviewed the copy of the billing records from October 18, 2022 through May 31, 2024 as provided in Exhibit 9 to Fink’s Declaration. Fink declares that the total amounts to $68,130.50. However, per the Court’s aggregation of the bills (calculating purely attorney time, and not including the separate entries for filing fee costs), the billing records demonstrate $67,775.00 in billed time. Thus, the Court will use $67,775.00 as a representation of the reasonable time and rate Defendant’s counsel spent working on the case. As to the additional amount Mr. Fink tacks onto the billing records for anticipated time pertaining to this Motion, although Plaintiffs did not provide any meaningful opposition to the Motion, the Court nonetheless finds the request for 22.8 hours (collectively) at $395.00/hour total to draft the Motion, review the opposition, draft a reply, and attend the hearing to be excessive on its face.  The Court will reduce the hours related to this Motion. The Court reduces the requested 12.8 hours to 6 hours at the rate of $395.00/hour to draft the instant Motion. Considering the brevity and lack of substance contained in Plaintiffs’ opposition, the anticipated 10 hours to review the opposition and to draft Defendant’s brief reply is also excessive. The Court will reduce this amount of time from 10 hours to 3 hours, which represents the reasonable time to review Plaintiffs’ opposition, draft the reply, and to appear at the hearing, at a $395.00/hour rate.  V. CONCLUSION Defendant Wilmington Trust, N.A. as Trustee for Structured Asset Mortgage Investments II Trust 2007-AR7 Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates 2007-AR7’s motion for attorney fees against Plaintiffs is GRANTED in the total reduced amount of $73,818.50.  Moving Party is ordered to give notice.  DATED: September 24, 2024 __________________________ Hon.
