And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's petition to confirm the contractual arbitration award with prejudice. Despite multiple attempts to correct the petition, the plaintiff continues to hold the individual defendant, Abraham Anthony Prattella, liable. The judge has previously ruled that Prattella is not a named party to the arbitration award and that the corporation, Built on Solid Rock Construction (BOSR), is the only responsible party. The arbitration award requires BOSR to pay $50,000, but the plaintiff's petition misstates the terms of the award and continues to hold Prattella liable. The judge has denied the petition with prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff will not be able to re-file the petition without significant changes.
