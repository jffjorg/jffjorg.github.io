  Case Number:  21PSCP00224    Hearing Date:   January 11, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative
Ruling
 
Plaintiff’s Petition to Confirm the Contractual
Arbitration Award is DENIED WITH prejudice, because despite four
attempts to provide a correct petition, Petitioner continues to hold the
individual defendant liable. 
 
Background
 
On May 7, 2021, Petitioner Martha I. Dube Rowley (“Petitioner”)
filed a “Petition to Confirm Contractual Arbitration Award” (“Petition”) as
against Respondent(s) Abraham Anthony Prattella (“Prattella”) and Built on
Solid Rock Construction (“BOSR”).
 
On June 24, 2021, the court denied the petition without
prejudice. 
 
On October 20, 2021, the court denied the amended petition
without prejudice. 
 
On August 31, 2021, Petitioner filed the instant third
petition to confirm the arbitration award. 
 
On October 31, 2023, Pratella filed a Response to the third
petition. 
 
On May 3, 2023, the court issued the followed minute
regarding the status conference: “Supplemental briefs are allowed but not
required. Briefs are to be filed on or before 06/30/2023.”
 
On September 6, 2023, the court adopted its tentative ruling
as final which denied the petition without prejudice “for the sole
purpose of filing a renewed petition that excludes Pratella.” (See 9/6/23
minute order.) 
 
On November 1, 2023, petitioner re-filed her petition.
 
On December 20, 2023, Pratella filed his response. 
 
 
 
Discussion
 
In the court’s three previous rulings, the court has noted
that Prattella is not a named party to the arbitration award. As summarized in
the court’s 9/6/23 ruling, “all the facts indicate that Prattella as an
individual does not have an arbitral award against him and thus is erroneously
named as a party.” Based on the court’s analysis, the court “only grant[ed]
leave to file a renewed fourth petition that is to exclude Prattella.” (See
9/6/23 ruling.) 
 
But Petitioner again fails to cure the defect. (See generally
Opposition.) While the petition correctly identifies the corporation as the
respondent (section 1 of petition) and correctly identifies that the arbitrator
determined that the respondent is required to pay petitioner $50,000 (section 8
of the petition), petitioner misstates the terms of the award by
indicating that the “managing officer is the responsible party.” (See Section
8(b)(4) of the petition.) The arbitration award does not make any such finding.
(See Petition, p. 19 of 33 of PDF [Arbitration Award].)
 
Thus, despite clear instructions that only the corporate
defendant is the responsible party and that as such only the corporate
defendant is to bear any liability, Petitioner has continued to defy both the
arbitrator’s decision and this court’s rulings. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the court DENIES the petition with
prejudice.
