Legal Standard
 
As relevant here, a demurrer may be asserted when the
pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer
must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable
matters.  CCP §430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan, (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318. 
 
The face of the pleading includes attachments and
incorporations by reference (Frantz v. Blackwell, (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d
91, 94); it does not include inadmissible hearsay.  Day v. Sharp,
(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 904, 914.   
 
Discussion
 
As this is a fraud cause of action which requires a
heightened pleading standard,[1]
the court’s tentative will focus on the issue of whether the FAC alleges
specific facts of fraud. 
 
The CLRA protects individuals
engaging in consumer transactions.  The CLRA prohibits “unfair methods of
competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices undertaken by any person
in a transaction intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of
goods or services to any consumer.”  (Civ. Code, § 1770, subd. (a).) 
The CLRA sets forth twenty-seven (27) different “unfair or deceptive acts or
practices” that may constitute a violation of the statute.  (Ibid.) 
In assessing whether the representations made in the course of the consumer
transaction violate the CLRA, courts use the reasonable consumer standard—i.e.,
whether a reasonable consumer would be misled by the representation.  (Consumer
Advocates v. Echostar Satellite Corp. (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 1351,
1360.)  To the extent an alleged violation is based on the defendant’s
omission of a material fact, “to be actionable the omission must be contrary to
a representation actually made by the defendant, or an omission of a fact the
defendant was obliged to disclose.”  (Daugherty v. American Honda Motor
Co., Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 824, 835.)  A cause of action under
the CLRA “must be stated with reasonable particularity, which is a more lenient
pleading standard than is applied to common law fraud claims.”  (Gutierrez
v. Carmax Auto Superstore California (2018) 19 Cal.App.5th 1234,
1261.) 
 
“[T]he elements of a cause of action for fraud based on
concealment are: ‘“(1) the defendant must have concealed or suppressed a
material fact, (2) the defendant must have been under a duty to disclose the
fact to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have intentionally concealed or
suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff
must have been unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had
known of the concealed or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the
concealment or suppression of the fact, the plaintiff must have sustained
damage.”’” (Jones v. ConocoPhillips Co. (2011) 198 Cal. App. 4th 1187,
1198, quoting Kaldenbach v. Mutual of Omaha Life Ins. Co. (2009) 178
Cal.App.4th 830, 850.)
 
The 4th COA alleges as follows:
 
GENERAL MOTORS LLC intentionally
concealed the design defect found in the 8L90 and 8L45 transmissions because
the of the common architecture of the transmission that causes “harsh shifts”
in lower gears, which can feel like jerking, lurching, and/or hesitations . . .
As a result of GM’s failure to disclose to Plaintiff the material fact that the
8L90 and 8L45 transmissions are defective, Plaintiff is required to spend
thousands of dollars to repair or replace the defective transmission or sell
their vehicles at a substantial loss . . . GENERAL MOTORS LLC intended to
deceive Plaintiff by concealing the known issues with the Transmission Defect
in an effort to sell the Subject Vehicle at a maximum price.
 
(Complaint pp. 25-26.) 
 
Here, as noted by Defendant in its demurrer, the allegations
are conclusory at best. Plaintiff fails to allege (i) the identity of the
individuals at GM who purportedly concealed material facts or made untrue
representations about his Silverado (ii) his authority to speak and act on
behalf of GM, (iii) GM’s knowledge about alleged defects in Plaintiff’s
Silverado at the time of purchase, (iv) any interactions with GM before or during
the purchase of his Silverado, or (v) GM’s intent to induce reliance by
Plaintiff to purchase the specific Silverado at issue.
 
In opposition, Plaintiff cites to Dhital v. Nissan North
America, Inc. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 828 to support its proposition that it
has pled enough as the “current case presents almost exactly the same fact
pattern as the one in Dhital.” (Opp. p. 13) However, the cases are
distinguishable. In Dhital, the plaintiffs alleged that the vehicle had
transmission problems “including stalling, jerking, and lack of power” such that the
“[u]ncertain and unpredictable performance of a vehicle's engine” caused
serious safety concerns. (Id. at p. 833.) Of import, the plaintiffs
alleged Nissan manufactured or distributed more than 500,000 vehicles that were
equipped with defective continuously variable transmissions (CVT's),
including plaintiffs’ model years 2013 through 2017. 
 
Here, however, Plaintiff does not predicate
Defendant’s knowledge of a supposed defect based upon the same engine.
Rather, Plaintiff alleges that GM knew, or should have known, about the
Transmission Defect because the 6L transmission on which the 8L transmission is
based suffered from similar defect. (FAC ¶44-47.) Simply put, Plaintiff is
imputing knowledge based upon a defect in a different engine. The mere
fact that the 8L transmissions succeeded the 6L transmission does not bear
significance for a fraud cause of action wherein a plaintiff is to plead that a
defendant made a specific misrepresentation as to a specific material
fact (i.e., specific misrepresentation as to 8L engine). 
 
Therefore, as Plaintiff has failed to plead sufficient facts
that GM concealed material information regarding the 8L transmission,
the court SUSTAINS the demurrer with leave to amend. The court need not address
the other two arguments nor the motion to strike as it is moot. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the demurrer is sustained with leave
to amend, and the motion to strike is moot.
