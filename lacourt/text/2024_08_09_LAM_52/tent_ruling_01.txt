  Case Number:  22STCV18057    Hearing Date:   August 9, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff Danielle Schlichter’s Motion to Set Aside
Judgment
            Plaintiff Danielle Schlichter moves to set aside the
judgment and enter an amended judgment including prejudgment interest. 
            Plaintiff shows good cause to correct the judgment.  Courts have inherent power to correct or
amend judgments.  (Curci Investments,
LLC v. Baldwin (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 214, 220; Ames v. Paley (2001)
89 Cal.App.4th 668, 672.)  After the
court trial, the court’s minute order dated January 10, 2024, states, “The
Court awards damages in the amount of $61,440.00 plus costs as provided by law
and prejudgment interest as provided by law.” 
The judgment entered on February 23, 2024, does not include any
prejudgment interest.  Plaintiff submitted
a proposed judgment including $22,826.43 in prejudgment interest, along with a
spreadsheet explaining how that amount was calculated.  (Stefan Decl., ¶ 9.)    
            Plaintiff did not complete section 5 of the proposed
judgment.  The court will modify the
judgment to complete that section.
Plaintiff
Danielle Schlichter’s motion to amend the judgment is granted.  The court will modify the proposed judgment
and enter judgment.
