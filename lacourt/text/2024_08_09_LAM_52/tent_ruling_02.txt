 Case Number:  23STCV06798    Hearing Date:   August 9, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendants Saul Diaz and Maria Adela Diaz’s Demurrer
to Complaint
Defendants Saul Diaz and Maria Adela Diaz demur to the
complaint by plaintiffs Anairel Diaz, Fredy Aguirre and minors Freddy Aguirre,
Axel Aguirre, and Asha Aguirre.
Defendants’ demurrer is untimely.  “A person against whom a complaint or
cross-complaint has been filed may, within 30 days after service of the
complaint or cross-complaint, demur to the complaint or cross-complaint.”  (CCP § 430.40(a).)  Plaintiffs filed proofs of service by
substituted service on defendants Saul Diaz and Maria Adela Diaz.  “Service of a summons” by substituted service
“is deemed complete on the 10th day after the mailing.”  (CCP § 415.20(b).)  The proofs of service attest to mailing the summons
and complaint to defendants on April 27, 2024. 
Service was therefore deemed complete on May 7.  Defendants had until June 6 to demur.  They served and filed the demurrer on July 1.
 The court exercises its discretion not
to consider defendants’ untimely demurrer.
Defendants Saul Diaz and Maria Adela Diaz’s demurrer is overruled.  Defendants Saul Diaz and Maria Adela Diaz are
ordered to answer within 15 days.
