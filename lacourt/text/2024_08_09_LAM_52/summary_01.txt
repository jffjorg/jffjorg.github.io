Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted plaintiff Danielle Schlichter's motion to set aside the judgment and enter an amended judgment. The original judgment did not include prejudgment interest, despite the court's minute order stating that it should. The plaintiff submitted a proposed judgment with prejudgment interest, and the court will modify the judgment to include this amount. The court has the inherent power to correct or amend judgments, and has done so in this case. The judgment will be modified to complete a missing section, and then entered.
