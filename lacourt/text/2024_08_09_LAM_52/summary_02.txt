And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by defendants Saul Diaz and Maria Adela Diaz to the complaint filed by plaintiffs Anairel Diaz, Fredy Aguirre, and the minors Freddy Aguirre, Axel Aguirre, and Asha Aguirre. The defendants' demurrer was filed late, as service of the summons and complaint was deemed complete on May 7, 2024, and defendants had until June 6, 2024, to demur. Despite this, the court exercises its discretion and will not consider the untimely demurrer. As a result, the defendants' demurrer is overruled and they are ordered to answer the complaint within 15 days.
