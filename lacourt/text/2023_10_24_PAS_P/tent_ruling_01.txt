          I.        INTRODUCTION
These related cases concern events that
transpired on April 16, 2014. For ease of reference, case no. BC616980 is
referred to as the Fitilchyan Action and case no. BC617479 as the Torosian
Action.  
The Fitilchyan Action alleges that Arutyun
Fitilchyan (Fitilchyan) was contacted by Akop Torosian (Akop) to perform some
locksmith services. Fitilchyan alleges he was on his way to deliver brochures
and schedule the service when he ran low on fuel. On telephoning Akop about his
tardiness, Akop began to verbally abuse Fitilchyan, which caused Fitilchyan to
decide he was no longer willing to provide the services. Fitilchyan alleges
that after this he went to visit his friend Hrachya Gasparyan (Gasparyan) at his
body shop. Fitilchyan alleges that while the two were having coffee at the body
shop, Akop showed up and proceeded to scream obscenities at him and the two of
them got into a scuffle which body shop employees broke up. Fitilchyan alleges
Akop left but then returned with his brother Robert Torosian (Robert), who
charged Fitilchyan and struck him with his fist. Fitilchyan alleges that Akop
then produced a gun and began shooting at them.   In response, Gasparyan retrieved a gun and
returned fire.  
The Torosian action alleges
the meeting at the body shop was a set up, and that Akop and Robert were
ambushed. This complaint further alleges that following the shooting, Fitilchyan,
Gasparyan, and a third person present attempted to extort Akop and Robert by
convincing them to pay $2 million. 
Moving party on these
motions, Defendant Armen Tashjian, is a named defendant in the Torosian Action.
He is not alleged to have participated in the assault and battery cause of
action. He is sued for loss of consortium, abuse of process, extortion, conspiracy
to commit extortion and intentional infliction of emotional distress.     
Before the Court are two motions
to compel responses to requests for production of documents. Tashjian served
Marina Fermanyan with a Request for Production of Documents and Robert Torosian
with a Demand for Inspection. Neither Plaintiff  responded to the discovery. Both motions are
unopposed.  Tashjian is therefore
entitled to the relief requested. The motions compelling a response to the
request for production and demand for inspection are granted.  
 
II.       LEGAL
STANDARD
 “Any party may obtain discovery by inspecting,
copying, testing, or sampling documents, tangible things, land or other
property, and electronically stored information in the possession, custody, or
control of any other party to the action.” (CCP § 2031.010.) If a
party to whom interrogatories or an inspection demand were directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses without objections. (CCP § 2031.300(b).) Moreover, failure to timely
serve responses waives objections to the requests. (CCP § 2031.300(a).) Failure
to verify a response is equivalent to no response at all. (Appleton v.
Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)   
“The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney
advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (CCP §
2023.030(a).) Misuse of the discovery process includes: “(d) failing to respond
or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.” (CCP § 2023.010(d).) Reasonable
expenses under CCP section 2023.030(a) include the time spent in researching
and preparing the motion, as well as court time and travel time spent in
connection with the motion. (Ghanooni
v. Super Shuttle (1993) 20
Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) 
 
 
 
 
          III.     ANALYSIS
A. Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for
Production As to Plaintiff Marina Fermanyan
          i. Motion 
Tashjian presents evidence
that on July 30, 2021, he served Marina Fermanyan (Fermanyan) by personal
service with Requests for Production, Set One. Responses were due September 2,
2021. Tashjian also presents evidence that he emailed all plaintiffs on August
1, 2023 and demanded a response. (Hirota Decl., Exh. B.) In his August 1 email,
counsel for Tashjian, Michael Hirota, requested responses to the discovery
requests no later than August 8, 2023. (Id.) On August 3, 2023, Robert Torosian
responded by email, on behalf of all three plaintiffs, and requested an
additional 30 days to respond. (Hirota Decl., Exh. C.) As of the time of posting
this tentative, Fermanyan has not responded.
Based
on the above evidence, Tashjian has established that Fermanyan was served with
a Set of Requests for Production and has not provided responses despite multiple
follow-ups and an extension of time in which to respond. Pursuant to CCP
section 2031.300(b), the Court grants the motion to compel responses to the
request for production.
ii. Sanctions
Tashjian alleges that Fermanyan’s failure to provide
responses to his discovery request constitutes a misuse of the discovery
process. (Motion, p.8: 1-10.) This argument is well-taken. (See CCP §
2023.010(d).) Tashjian requests sanctions in the amount of $1,000.00 against
Plaintiff Fermanyan. (Motion p.8: 11-13.) Tashjian’s counsel, Michael Hirota, avers
that he spent 4 hours preparing the motion as to Plaintiff Fermanyan and to Plaintiff
Robert Torosian. (Hirota Decl. ¶ 7.) He anticipates another 4 hours, 2 hours to
draft a reply memorandum and 2 hours attending the hearing on the motion. (Id.)
His hourly rate is $250.00. (Id.)
The Court finds that the hourly rate is reasonable. As
this motion is unopposed however, the Court declines to issue monetary
sanctions for time not spent on a reply memorandum. As such, the Court finds
that the total hours spent is 6 hours, for a total of $1,500.00. The Court
finds that 2 hours per motion for preparation and 1 hour per motion for
appearance is reasonable; e.g., 3 hours at $250/hour = $750.00. 
 
B. Motion to Compel Responses to Demand for Inspection
As to Plaintiff Robert Torosian
i. Motion
Tashjian presents evidence
that on July 30, 2021, he served Robert Torosian by personal service with three
sets of discovery, including the Demand for Inspection. Responses were due
September 2, 2021. Tashjian also presents evidence that he emailed all
plaintiffs on August 1, 2023 and demanded a response. (Hirota Decl., Exh. B.)
In his August 1 email, counsel for Tashjian, Michael Hirota, requested
responses to the discovery requests no later than August 8, 2023. (Id.)
On August 3, 2023, Robert responded by email, on behalf of all three
plaintiffs, and requested an additional 30 days to respond. (Hirota Decl., Exh.
C.) As of the time of this motion, Robert has not responded.
Based
on the above evidence, Tashjian has established that Robert was served with a Demand
for Inspection and has not provided responses. Pursuant to CCP section 2031.300(b),
the Court grants the motion to compel responses to the Demand for Inspection.
ii. Sanctions
Tashjian alleges that Torosian’s failure to provide
responses to his discovery request constitutes a misuse of the discovery
process. (Motion, p.8: 1-10.) This argument is well-taken. (See CCP §
2023.010(d).) As discussed above, the Court finds Tashjian’s counsel’s $250.00
hourly rate reasonable. The Court finds that 2 hours per motion in preparation
and 1 hour per motion for appearance is reasonable. As such, the Court issues
monetary sanctions against Plaintiff Robert Torosian in the amount of $750.00. 
The court hereby orders Plaintiff Robert Torosian to
pay Tashjian $750.00 in monetary sanctions. 
IV.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
          The motions filed by Defendant Tashjian for orders compelling
responses and for monetary sanctions are GRANTED. 
As to
Marina Fermanyan, she is ordered to provide full and complete responses within
10 days of this order. Marina Fermanyan is ordered to pay a monetary sanction
of $750.00 to Tashjian within 20 days. 
As
to Robert Torosian, he is ordered to provide full and complete responses within
10 days of this order. Robert Torosian is ordered to pay a monetary sanction of
$750.00 to Tashjian within 20 days. 
Tashjian
is ordered to provide notice of ruling.
