Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is related to a court hearing on October 24, 2023, in the case of Arutyun Fitilchyan et al. v. Akop Torosian et al. The case concerns events that occurred on April 16, 2014, where Fitilchyan alleges that he was contacted by Torosian to perform locksmith services, but was verbally abused and later involved in a scuffle and shooting at a body shop. The case also involves allegations of extortion and conspiracy to commit extortion.

The judge grants two motions to compel responses to requests for production of documents and demand for inspection, filed by Defendant Armen Tashjian. The motions are unopposed, and the judge finds that the plaintiffs, Marina Fermanyan and Robert Torosian, have failed to respond to the discovery requests despite multiple follow-ups and an extension of time to respond.

The judge orders the plaintiffs to provide full and complete responses within 10 days and to pay monetary sanctions of $750.00 each within 20 days. The judge also orders Defendant Tashjian to provide notice of the ruling.
