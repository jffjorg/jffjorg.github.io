This petition was filed on January 25,
2022, by Mortgage Lender Services, Inc. (“MLS”) because there were surplus
funds in the amount of $44,870.29 from a trustee’s sale of the property located
at 1550 Atchison Street, Pasadena, CA 91104 (“Property”). The entirety of these
surplus funds were claimed by Kenneth Gray (“Mr. Gray”) and the Los Angeles
County Treasurer and Tax Collector. Due to MLS’s inability to determine how to
distribute the funds, MLS filed a petition to deposit them with the Court. The
petition was granted and the funds were deposited on August 12, 2022. On
January 6, 2023, the Honorable Colin P. Leis discharged MLS from the case and
any further appearances; Judge Leis also set a non-appearance case review for
June 21, 2023. 
On January 6, 2023, this matter was
reassigned and the Court set a notice of case reassignment and an order to give
notice. On January 17, 2023, a proof of service was filed showing that MLS
served the notice of reassignment on KAG Consulting, Inc. c/o Mr. Gray at 1091
Northwestern Drive, Claremont, CA 91711 and 4 other addresses. 
On June 21, 2023, the Court issued a
minute order scheduling a hearing regarding all claims to the surplus funds on
October 5, 2023. All claims were to be filed at least 15 days before the
hearing date. A certificate of mailing shows that this order was mailed to MLS’s
counsel, Mr. Gray, and the Los Angeles County Treasurer and Tax Collector. 
On October 5, 2023, the Court noted
that there were no appearances and that no claims had been filed, therefore,
the hearing was placed off calendar. 
On August 5, 2024, the Court reiterated
that there were no claimants to the surplus funds and issued an order forwarding
the surplus funds to the State Controller’s Office pursuant to the Unclaimed
Property Law. A certificate of mailing shows that this notice of escheatment
was sent to MLS’s counsel, Kenneth Gray, and the Los Angeles County Treasurer
and Tax Collector. 
On August 26, 2024, Mr. Gray filed this
motion, styled as a motion for reconsideration and motion to release the excess
surplus funds from the trustee sale. Notice of this motion was given to MLS as
well as the Los Angeles County Treasurer and Tax Collector. 
Any motion for reconsideration must be
made within 10 days after service on the moving party of written notice of
entry of the order. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a). A judge does not have
jurisdiction to consider a motion for reconsideration that is untimely. (Marriage
of Furie (2017) 16 CA5th 816, 831.) Accordingly, the motion for
reconsideration is DENIED.
