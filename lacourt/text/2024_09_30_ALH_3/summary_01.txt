And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a motion for reconsideration filed by Kenneth Gray, which seeks to release the excess surplus funds from the trustee sale of the property at 1550 Atchison Street, Pasadena, CA 91104. The surplus funds, in the amount of $44,870.29, were deposited with the Court after MLS, the mortgage lender, was unable to determine how to distribute the funds. The Judge notes that the motion for reconsideration is untimely, as it was filed more than 10 days after the order was entered. Therefore, the motion is denied. The Judge also notes that the Court may, at its discretion, adopt the tentative ruling as the final order or place the motion off calendar if the parties do not submit on the tentative ruling or appear at the hearing.
