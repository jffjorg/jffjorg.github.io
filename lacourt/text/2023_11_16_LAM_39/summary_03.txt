And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for attorney's fees filed by Petitioners, Porch.com, Inc. and Matthew Ehrlichman, against Respondent Kandela, LLC. The Petitioners seek attorney's fees under the Asset Purchase Agreement (APA) in the amount of $93,875.50. The APA contains an arbitration clause, which states that the arbitrator will award attorney's fees and costs to the prevailing party. The Judge finds that the billing rates are imminently reasonable and that the Petitioner's counsel have provided sufficient evidence to support the requested hours. The Judge also notes that Respondent "created its own problem" by litigating a meritless opposition to Petitioner's motion, which forced Petitioner's counsel to engage in efforts to satisfy the judgment. Therefore, the Judge grants the Petitioner's motion and orders Respondent to pay Petitioner's attorney's fees and costs within 30 days.
