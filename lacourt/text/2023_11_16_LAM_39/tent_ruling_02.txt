 Case Number:  20STCV10698    Hearing Date:   November 16, 2023    Dept:  39 John Doe v. Los
Angeles Unified School District, et al.
Case No.
20STCV10698
Ex Parte
Application to File Under Seal
 
            The Los
Angeles Unified School District (the “LAUSD”) seeks to file the motion for
summary judgment and related material under seal.  Civil
court proceedings are presumptively open to the public.  (See Richmond
Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia (1980) 448 U.S. 555, 580, fn. 17.)  Before sealing records, “a trial court must
hold a hearing and expressly find that (i) there exists an overriding interest
supporting closure and/or sealing; (ii) there is a substantial probability that
the interest will be prejudiced absent closure and/or sealing; (iii) the
proposed closure and/or sealing is narrowly tailored to serve the overriding
interest; and (iv) there is no less restrictive means of achieving the
overriding interest.”  (NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior
Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1217-1218.) 
The Court must review the pleadings in order to determine
whether, and to what extent, they should be sealed in consideration of the
relevant factors.
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the Court orders as follows:
 
            1.         The Court continues the hearing on the ex
parte application to the same date/time as the hearing on the motion for
summary judgment: January 18, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  
 
            2.         The Court grants conditional
authorization for the LAUSD—as well as Plaintiff—to file any pleadings
associated with the motion for summary judgment under seal.  
 
            3.         The Court orders the parties to provide
courtesy copies of all pleadings to the Court forthwith.  
 
            4.         The Court shall review pleadings and
determine whether, and to what extent, they should be sealed.  If the Court determines that some of the pleadings
should be filed publicly, the Court will identify those portions and order the parties
to file unsealed versions.
 
            5.         The LAUSD shall provide notice and file
proof of such with the Court.
