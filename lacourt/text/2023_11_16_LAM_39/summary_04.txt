And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to bifurcate the trial in a case involving employment discrimination and sexual harassment. The defendants, Browning-Ferris Industries of California, Inc. and Peter Pouwels, have moved to bifurcate the trial to have separate trials for each of the ten plaintiffs. The judge has denied this motion, finding that judicial economy would not be served by having separate trials for the same issues. The judge has also ordered the case to be stayed pending preparation of long cause trial binders and assignment to a long cause courtroom, citing the large number of witnesses and hours of testimony involved in the case.
