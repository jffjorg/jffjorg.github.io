And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge 39 regarding a motion to enforce a settlement agreement in the case of Eduvina Martinez, et al. v. Lotfallah Shokrian, et al. (Case No. BC667432). The plaintiffs filed a habitability action in 2017, which was settled. The settlement agreement provides for the payment of $55,000 plus $11,000 in interest, for a total of $66,000. The defendants do not dispute their obligation to pay this amount, but raise several procedural arguments, including a lack of jurisdiction and unclear notice. However, the court finds that these arguments lack merit and grants the motion to enforce the settlement. The court also denies the plaintiffs' request for attorney's fees and costs without prejudice, allowing them to file a separate motion if there is a contractual or statutory basis for the request.
