And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike in this case. The plaintiff, Guninder Singh, alleges that he was retaliated against by the County of Los Angeles and individual defendants for reporting violations of state and federal law. The judge has overruled the demurrer by the County of Los Angeles, but sustained the demurrer by the individual defendants.

The judge has also sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, finding that the alleged conduct was within the normal scope of employment and therefore not actionable. The judge has denied leave to amend the complaint, finding that the plaintiff cannot remedy the defects.

The judge has denied the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages, finding that it is not necessary to strike the prayer for punitive damages because the plaintiff has already alleged damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress.

The judge has set a trial date of June 3, 2025, and has ordered the parties to comply with all pretrial procedures.
