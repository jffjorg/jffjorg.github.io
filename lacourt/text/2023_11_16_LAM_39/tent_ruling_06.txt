v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.
Case No.
22STCV19481
Ex Parte
Application
 
            Plaintiffs
filed an ex parte application for an order to advance their motion for
sanctions, as well as for an informal discovery conference (“IDC”).  The Court grants the ex parte application in
part and denies the ex parte application in part.  The Court orders as follows:
 
            1.         The Court advances the hearing on
Plaintiffs’ motion for sanctions to February 5, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
 
            2.         The Court advances and continues the
hearings on Defendants’ motions for summary judgment from January 19 and
February 2, 2024, to February 5, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
 
            3.         The Court denies the request for an
IDC.  The issues are not conducive to an
IDC, and the Court does not have ready availability in December and January
2024.
 
            4.         Plaintiff’s counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of such with the Court.
