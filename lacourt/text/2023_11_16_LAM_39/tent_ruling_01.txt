  Case Number:  19STCV25883    Hearing Date:   November 16, 2023    Dept:  39 Consumer Advocacy
Group v. Ross Stores, Inc., et al.
Case No.
19STCV25883
Motion to Approve
Settlement
 
            Plaintiff
filed this action against Ross Stores, Inc., doing business as “DD’s
Discounts,” on July 23, 2019.  The
parties have reached a settlement and stipulated to a consent judgment.  The settlement contemplates a civil penalty
and attorney’s fees in the amount of $72,000. 
The Court continued the hearing and requested further information in
support of this requested amount.  This
amount includes Plaintiff’s counsel’s costs, which are almost $20,000.  (See Declaration of Reuben Yeroushalmi, ¶¶ 5,
9.)  The remaining amount of fees is
reasonable, given the issues in the case, the length of time the case lasted,
the litigation involved in this case, and the litigation risk.  Therefore, the Court grants the motion to approve
the settlement and the stipulated consent judgment.
 
            This is the
final defendant in the case (except for Doe defendants).  On June 2, 2022, Plaintiff’s counsel
dismissed the only causes of action against Nicole Miller, Ltd. and Enchante
Accessories.  The Court entered a consent
judgment against Oliva Miller, Inc. 
Therefore, the Court sets no future dates and orders the Clerk to issue
the final judgment and close the case.
 
            Plaintiff’s
counsel shall provide notice and file proof of such with the Court.
