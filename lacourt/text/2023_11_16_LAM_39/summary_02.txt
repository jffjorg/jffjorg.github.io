And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) has applied to file its motion for summary judgment and related material under seal. The court must review the pleadings to determine whether they should be sealed, considering factors such as the existence of an overriding interest supporting closure, the likelihood of prejudice if the records are not sealed, and the narrowness of the proposed sealing. The judge continues the hearing on the ex parte application to the same date and time as the hearing on the motion for summary judgment. The judge grants conditional authorization for LAUSD and the plaintiff to file certain pleadings under seal, but requires the parties to provide courtesy copies of all pleadings to the court. The court will review the pleadings and determine whether they should be sealed, and will identify any public portions and order the parties to file unsealed versions.
