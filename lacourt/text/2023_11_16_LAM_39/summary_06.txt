And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling grants an ex parte application in part and denies it in part. The court advances the hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for sanctions to February 5, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. and advances and continues the hearings on the defendants' motions for summary judgment from January 19 and February 2, 2024, to February 5, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The court, however, denies the request for an informal discovery conference (IDC) due to the lack of availability in December and January 2024. The plaintiffs' counsel is required to provide notice and file proof of the same with the court.
