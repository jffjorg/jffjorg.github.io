BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from an alleged breach of contract.
 
On October 18, 2023, Plaintiff BMO Bank N.A. (“Plaintiff” or “BMO Bank”) initiated the action against
Defendants Medina Truck & Transport, Inc. (“MT&T”), Salvador Medina
(“Medina”) (collectively, “Defendants”) and Does 1-20. The Complaint alleges:
(1) Breach of Written Agreement (against MT&T); (2) Breach of Continuing
Guaranty (against Medina); (3) Claim and Delivery (against all Defendants); and
(4) Conversion (against all Defendants).
 
On May 30, 2024, the Court
overruled a demurrer with motion to strike, filed by Medina on December 2,
2023. Subsequently, Defendants filed their Answer to the Complaint on June 12,
2024.
 
On the same day, May 30, 2024,
the Court granted Plaintiff’s application for writ of possession against
Medina.
 
On June 17, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant Motion to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One, as admitted
(the “Motion”).
 
No Opposition or Reply papers
have been received by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by
a written request that any other party to the action admit the genuineness of
specified documents, or the truth of specified matters of fact, opinion
relating to fact, or application of law to fact. A request for admission may
relate to a matter that is in controversy between the parties.”¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.010.)¿ “Within 30 days after service of requests for admission,
the party to whom the requests are directed shall serve the original of the
response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the response on all
other parties who have appeared ....”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd.
(a).)¿
 
If a party to whom request for
admissions is served fails to provide a timely response, the party to whom the
request was directed waives any objections, including based on privilege or the
work product doctrine. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) The requesting
party can move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted, as well as for
monetary sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) The court shall
issue this order unless the party to whom the request was made serves a
response in substantial compliance prior to the hearing on the motion. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)¿
 
A.   
Motion to Deem
Requests for Admission, Set One, as Admitted
 
Defendants’ counsel, Michael
Brown (“Brown”), attests that on or about December 20, 2023, Defendant Medina was
served with the first set of Requests for Admission by both mail and email. (Brown
Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. “1.”) This service established that responses were due on January
24, 2024. On February 6, 2024, Brown’s send a meet and confer letter to
Medina’s counsel requesting responses. (Id. ¶ 5.)  However, as of the date of filing of the
Motion, Medina has not served any responses. (Id. ¶ 6.) 
 
Based on the above records,
the Court determines that Defendant Medina failed to serve a timely response,
thereby waiving any objection to the requests, including those based on
privilege or the protection for work product, pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (a).
 
Furthermore,
Defendant Medina did not file an Opposition to the Motion. Additionally, there
is no record indicating any responses have been subsequently served by Medina
prior to the hearing. 
 
Consequently,
the Court GRANTS the unopposed Motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2033.280, subdivision (c).
 
A.   
Monetary
Sanctions
 
“It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).))
 
Utilizing the lodestar approach, the
Court determines the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs
incurred for the work performed in connection with the Motion to be $547.50,
calculated based on a reasonable hourly rate of $325.00 for 1.5 hours
reasonably spent, plus a $60.00 filing fee.
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiff’s request for
monetary sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff BMO Bank N.A.’s unopposed Motion to Deem
Requests for Admission, Set One, served on Defendant Salvador Medina as
Admitted is GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff BMO Bank N.A.’s Request
for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART. 
 
Defendant Salvador
Medina and his
attorney of record are ordered to jointly and severally pay $547.50 to Plaintiff BMO Bank N.A.’s counsel within 20 days.
