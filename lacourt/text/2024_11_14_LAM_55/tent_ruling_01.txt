LEGAL STANDARD
When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. Wilson v. Transit Authority of City of Sacramento
(1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 716, 720-21. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must
be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994. “A demurrer tests the
pleading alone, and not on the evidence or facts alleged.” E-Fab, Inc. v.
Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315. As such, courts
assume the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual
allegations. Ibid. However, it does not accept as true deductions,
contentions, or conclusions of law or fact. Stonehouse Homes LLC v. City of
Sierra Madre (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 531, 538. 
Further, the court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading. Code Civ. Proc., § 436(a). The court
may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.
Id., § 436(b). The grounds for a motion to strike are that the pleading
has irrelevant, false, or improper matter, or has not been drawn or filed in
conformity with laws. Id. § 436. The grounds for moving to strike must
appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. Id. §
437. 
Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable
possibility of successful amendment. See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18
Cal.3d 335, 349 (court shall not “sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if
there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment”);
Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency (2002) 108
Cal.App.4th 1028, 1037 (“A demurrer should not be sustained without leave to
amend if the complaint, liberally construed, can state a cause of action under
any theory or if there is a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured by
amendment.”). The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a
pleading can be amended successfully. Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d
311, 318.
 
ANALYSIS
Demurrer
I. Battery
Defendants argue that Plaintiffs fail to allege facts
sufficient to support a claim of battery.
“The essential elements of a cause of action for battery
are: (1) defendant touched plaintiff, or caused plaintiff to be touched, with
the intent to harm or offend plaintiff; (2) plaintiff did not consent to the
touching; (3) plaintiff was harmed or offended by defendant’s conduct; and (4)
a reasonable person in plaintiff’s position would have been offended by the
touching.” So v. Shin (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 652, 668-669.
First, Defendants argue that a battery requires a physical
touching by one person with the person of another. While person-to-person
contact can constitute a battery, it is not required. Mount Vernon Fire Ins.
Co. v. Busby, 219 Cal. App. 4th 876, 881(“tort of battery generally is not
limited to direct body-to-body contact.”).
Next, Defendants argue that battery requires the defendant
accomplish the touching using physical force. Defendants cite Gunnel v.
Metrocolor Labs (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 710, 724-725 (Gunnel), which
rejected a plaintiff’s battery claim based on his employer’s removal of warning
labels from a cleaning solution and false assurance to the plaintiff that the
solution was safe to use. Gunnel, supra, 92 Cal.App.4th at p. 723. However,
Gunnel concerned criminal battery, which is defined as “‘any
willful and unlawful use of force or violence upon the person of another.’” Id.
at p. 725 (quoting Pen. Code § 242). There, the issue was “not whether a ‘touching
occurred … [but] whether the touching occurred through [the defendant’s] ‘use
of force or violence.’” Ibid.
Finally, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ allegations do
not support the inference that Defendants knew of the presence of the bedbugs
in Plaintiffs’ room and fail to allege facts showing that Defendants intended
for them to be bitten by bedbugs. The Court agrees. 
Plaintiffs fail to plead facts to support the element of
intent to harm or offend. Plaintiffs merely stated conclusions. Plaintiffs rely
upon conclusory statements such as allegations that Defendants acted
intentionally, willfully, and recklessly without facts to support these
conclusions. Plaintiffs rely upon conclusions that Defendants “deliberately and
recklessly chose not to inspect or otherwise ensure that Plaintiffs’ room was
free of Cimex lectularius (“bedbugs”) immediately before Plaintiffs’ stay at
the hotel.” Complaint ¶ 26. However, Plaintiffs allege no facts to demonstrate
that Defendants were aware of any bed bug infestation in Plaintiffs’ room
immediately before Plaintiffs’ stay at the hotel and that despite this
awareness, Defendants knowingly allowed Plaintiffs to stay in the bed bug-infested
room with the intent to harm or offend the Plaintiffs. 
Likewise, the Complaint alleges that “[t]he intent of
Defendants, and DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, is satisfied and evident from
Defendants, and DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, recklessly failing to warn
Plaintiffs of the dangerous bedbug infestation in their room, given Defendants’,
and DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, prior knowledge of an infestation. Plaintiffs
did not receive any kind of warning or statement from Defendants, and DOES 1
through 20, inclusive, that the Subject Hotel had an infestation of bedbugs and
did not regularly change the bedding, bed sheets, pillows, and skirts of the
beds or thoroughly check and inspect them for infestations.” Complaint ¶ 54. Plaintiffs
further allege that Defendants failed to inspect or clean their room
for bedbugs properly, failed to train staff, and chose to assign
Plaintiffs a room containing bedbugs. Id. ¶ 56. They also allege
that Defendants failed to follow Department of Health rules to ensure sanitary
conditions at the hotel. Id. ¶ 59-60. However, these facts support
negligence rather than battery.
The legal conclusion that Defendants “did the aforementioned
acts with the intent to cause a harmful or offensive contact” does not match
the facts alleged in the prior paragraph. See Complaint ¶ 57. Although
Plaintiffs are entitled to allege ultimate facts, here, Plaintiffs have alleged
specific facts that do not support the conclusion that Defendants acted with
intent to cause a harmful contact with Plaintiffs. Accordingly, the demurrer is
sustained with leave to amend. 
II. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
Next, Defendants demur to the third cause of action for
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED). To state an IIED claim, a
plaintiff must allege facts showing: “(1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the
defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the
probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff’s suffering
severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of
the emotional distress by the defendant’s outrageous conduct.” Christensen
v. Superior Court (1991) 54 Cal.3d 868, 903 (citations omitted) (internal
quotation marks omitted). “It is not enough that the conduct be intentional and
outrageous. It must be conduct directed at the plaintiff, or occur in the
presence of a plaintiff of whom the defendant is aware.” Ibid. “In order
to avoid a demurrer, the plaintiff must allege with great specificity the acts
which he or she believes are so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually
tolerated in a civilized community.” Vasquez v. Franklin Management Real
Estate Fund, Inc. (2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 819, 832 (cleaned up).
“Conduct to be outrageous must be so extreme as to exceed
all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.” Id. at
p. 903. “Behavior may be considered outrageous if a defendant (1) abuses a
relation or position which gives him power to damage the plaintiff’s interest;
(2) knows the plaintiff is susceptible to injuries through mental distress; or
(3) acts intentionally or unreasonably with the recognition that the acts are
likely to result in illness through mental distress.” Smith v. BP Lubricants
USA Inc. (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 138, 147 (citations omitted) (internal
quotation marks omitted). “[W]hether conduct is outrageous is ‘“usually” a
question of fact.’” Id. at p.148. (quoting Barker v. Fox &
Associates (2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 333, 356.)
Defendants’ demurrer argues that Plaintiffs have not alleged
any facts of an intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability
of causing emotional distress. In opposition, Plaintiffs argue that they have
alleged numerous actions and conduct by Defendants that were outrageous -
namely directing employees not to clean or inspect for bedbugs, needlessly
heightening Plaintiff’s anxiety and concern, as well as, the fact that “[a]lthough
Defendants, and DOES 1 through 20, had prior knowledge of bedbug infestations
in their hotel, Defendants, and DOES 1 through 20, failed to eradicate such
infestations, including an infestation in the room that Plaintiff was provided”
and that “Defendants, and DOES 1 through 20, knew that their hotel had a prior
bedbug infestation. Defendants, and DOES 1 through 20, deliberately and
recklessly chose to turn a blind eye to this infestation and previous guest
complaints” (Complaint, ¶¶ 28, 32.)
These allegations do not constitute extreme and/or
outrageous conduct on behalf of Defendants. Plaintiffs allege that the presence
of bed bugs is not determined by the cleanliness of the living conditions where
they are found. Complaint ¶ 13. Plaintiffs fail to allege the time periods of the
earlier bedbug infestation, which Defendants allegedly knew about. Given the heightened
pleading requirements for an IIED cause of action, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’
Complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to support an IIED claim.
Accordingly, the demurrer is sustained with leave to amend. 
III. Fraudulent Concealment
“The required elements for fraudulent concealment are (1)
concealment or suppression of a material fact; (2) by a defendant with a duty
to disclose the fact to the plaintiff; (3) the defendant intended to defraud
the plaintiff by intentionally concealing or suppressing the fact; (4) the
plaintiff was unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he or she did if
he or she had known of the concealed or suppressed fact; and (5) plaintiff
sustained damage as a result of the concealment or suppression of the fact.” Graham
v. Bank of America, N.A. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 594, 606. The facts
constituting the alleged fraud must be alleged factually and specifically as to
every element of fraud, as the policy of “liberal construction” of the
pleadings will not ordinarily be invoked. Lazar v. Superior Court (1996)
12 Cal.4th 631, 645. As concealment is a species of fraud, it must also be pled
with specificity. Blickman Turkus, LP v. MF Downtown Sunnyvale, LLC
(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 858, 878. However, less specificity is required where
the defendant necessarily possesses the information. Committee on Children’s
Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 216.)
Moreover, it is not practical to allege facts showing how, when and by what
means something did not happen. Alfaro v. Community Housing Improvement Sys.
Planning Assn. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1384, However, if the
concealment is based on providing false or incomplete statements, the pleading
must at least set forth the substance of the statements at issue. Ibid.
A complaint alleging fraudulent concealment must allege “(1)
the content of the omitted facts, (2) the defendant’s awareness of
the materiality of those facts, (3) the inaccessibility of the facts to
the plaintiff, (4) the general point at which the omitted facts
should or could have been revealed, and (5) justifiable and actual reliance,
either through action or forbearance, based on the defendant’s omission.” Rattagan
v. Uber Technologies, Inc., 17 Cal. 5th 1, 43-44
Here, Plaintiffs’ claim fails because, as noted above, no
facts support Defendant’s prior knowledge of a bedbug infestation. Plaintiffs
allege that there are websites where guests can leave reviews. However, they do
not include any specific reviews alleging earlier bedbug incidents or alleging
that Defendants had read those reviews. Complaint ¶ 30. Because the Compliant
only includes an allegation of an unspecified prior infestation, it does not
sufficiently meet the heightened pleading standard of a fraud claim. Accordingly,
the demurrer to the fraudulent concealment claim is sustained with leave to
amend. 
IV. Private Nuisance
Defendants argue that Plaintiffs private nuisance claim
fails because, as a guest at a hotel, he lacked any interest in land, which
would give him standing to bring a private nuisance claim.
Private “[n]uisance liability arises from violation of a
duty to another that interferes with the free use and enjoyment of his or her
property.” Chee v. Amanda Goldt Property Management (2006) 143
Cal.App.4th 1360, 1373.) The elements of a private nuisance are: (1) the
plaintiff must prove an interference with his use and enjoyment of his
property; (2) the invasion of the plaintiff’s interest in the use and enjoyment
of the land caused the plaintiff to suffer “substantial actual damage”; and (3)
the interference with the protected interest is unreasonable. Mendez v.
Rancho Valencia Resort Partners, LLC (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 248, 262-63. The
test for whether the conduct is unreasonable, is “whether reasonable persons
generally, looking at the whole situation impartially and objectively would
consider [the interference] to be unreasonable.” San Diego Gas & Elec.
Co. v. Sup. Ct (1996) 13 Cal.4th 893, 938. The degree of harm is also an
objective standard that asks, “what effect would the invasion have on persons of
normal health and sensibilities living in the same community?” Monks v. City
of Rancho Palos Verdes (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 263, 303.
“‘[A]ny interest sufficient to be dignified as a property
right’ will support an action based on a private nuisance…’” Orange County
Water Dist. v. Sabic Innovative Plastics US, LLC (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 343,
416 (quoting Venuto v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. (1971) 22
Cal.App.3d 116, 125) (internal citations omitted) However, “‘Guests in a hotel,
boarders in a boarding house, and roomers or lodgers, so called, are generally
mere licensees and not tenants. They have only a personal contract, and acquire
no interest in the realty.’” Sloan v. Court Hotel (1945) 72 Cal.App.2d
308, 314. A property right sufficient to bring a claim based on private
nuisance “does not inure in favor of a licensee, lodger or employee.” Venuto,
supra, 22 Cal.App.3d at p. 125. As such, Plaintiff, as a licensee has not
alleged a sufficient property interest to bring a claim for private nuisance. Plaintiffs
fail to offer any argument as to how they could correct this defect.
Accordingly, the Court sustains the demurrer to the fifth cause of action
without leave to amend. 
V. Public Nuisance
A public nuisance is a nuisance that simultaneously affects
some other larger group of individuals. Civ. Code, § 3480. The necessary
elements for public nuisance are: (1) defendant created or permitted a
condition to exist that was harmful to health, (2) that condition affected
a substantial number of people at the same time, (3) an ordinary person would
be reasonably annoyed or disturbed by the condition, (4) the seriousness of the
harm outweighs the social utility of defendant’s conduct, (5) that plaintiff
suffered harm that was different from the type of harm suffered by the general
public, (6) that defendant’s conduct was a substantial factor in causing
plaintiff’s harm. CACI 2020.
Here, Plaintiffs fail to allege that the conduction affected
a substantial number of people at the same time. Plaintiffs only allege a risk
of the bedbugs spreading, which could affect a substantial number of people.
Complaint ¶128. As pleaded in the complaint, only Plaintiffs encountered
bedbugs in the subject hotel. Accordingly, the demurrer to the sixth cause of
action is sustained with leave to amend. 
Motion to Strike
Defendants request that the court strike the prayer for
punitive damages and portions of paragraphs 26 (in its entirety), 22, 29, 32,
35, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 50, 51 (in its entirety), 53 (in its entirety),
55, 56, 57 (in its entirety), 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 65 (in its entirety), 70, 79,
82 (in its entirety), 84 (in its entirety), 85 (in its entirety), 88, 90, 93
(in its entirety), 98, 102, 104, 110 (in its entirety), 113 (in its entirety), 115,
118, 120, 124, 127. 
The motion to strike is moot as to the paragraphs included
in the causes of action (¶¶52-131) other than negligence (¶¶66-82).
Civil Code § 3294 authorizes the recovery of punitive
damages in non-contract cases where “the defendant has been guilty of
oppression, fraud, or malice ….” The court in Taylor v. Superior Court
(1979) 24 Cal.3d 890, 894-95 held, “Something more than the mere commission of
a tort is always required for punitive damages. There must be circumstances of
aggravation or outrage, such as spite or ‘malice,’ or a fraudulent or evil
motive on the part of the defendant, or such a conscious and deliberate
disregard of the interests of others that his conduct may be called willful or
wanton.”
“Malice” is defined in Civil Code § 3294 to mean “conduct
which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or
despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” Civil Code §
3294(c)(1). As the court noted in College Hospital v. Superior Court
(1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 713, Section 3294 was amended in 1987 to require that,
where malice is based on a defendant’s conscious disregard of a plaintiff’s
rights, the conduct must be both despicable and willful. The court further held
that “despicable conduct refers to circumstances that are base, vile, or
contemptible.” Id. at 725 (citation omitted). Such conduct has been
described as “having the character of outrage frequently associated with crime.”
Tomaselli v. Transamerica Ins. Co. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1269, 1287
(citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). Further, “[t]here
must be evidence that defendant acted with knowledge of the probable dangerous
consequences to plaintiff’s interests and deliberately failed to avoid these
consequences.” Flyer’s Body Shop Profit Sharing Plan v. Ticor Title Ins. Co.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 1149, 1155.
A claim for punitive damages may not be based on conclusory
allegations of oppression, fraud, or malice but instead must be based on
factual allegations that support such a conclusion. See Smith v. Superior
Court (1992) 10 Cal. App. 4th 1033, 1041-1042 (Court of Appeal issued
peremptory writ directing trial court to issue order striking plaintiff’s
prayer for punitive damages because “[t]he sole basis for seeking punitive
damages are … conclusory allegations” which were “devoid of any factual
assertions supporting a conclusion [defendants] acted with oppression, fraud or
malice”).
A negligence claim generally will not support a claim for
punitive damages, as negligence is an unintentional tort, and a negligent party
has no desire to cause the harm that results from its conduct, differing from a
party who has engaged in willful misconduct and intended to cause harm. Grieves
v. Superior Court (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 166-167. Allegations of
negligence where injuries might occur but are not probable do not support punitive
damages claims. McDonell v American Trust Co. (1955) 130 Cal.App.2d 296,
300; see also Woolstrum v. Mailloux (1983) 141 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 12
(evidence of negligence insufficient to show that defendant knew or must have
known of the danger). 
As pleaded, there are insufficient facts to conclude that
Defendants were aware of a likelihood of harm but chose to ignore that risk.
There are also no specific facts that would indicate Defendants fraudulently
concealed the issue, made misrepresentations to Plaintiffs, or knowingly
subjected Plaintiffs to a room with bedbugs. While knowledge of an ongoing
issue, prior complaints, and a failure to remedy the issue despite such
knowledge could constitute malicious or oppressive behavior, Plaintiffs have
provided only speculative and conclusory statements without specific facts to
support a finding on either basis. Based on the allegations in the Complaint, it
is unclear whether Defendants were aware of any complaints or online reviews
about bedbugs. Accordingly, Defendants’ motion to strike is granted, with leave to amend, as to the request for punitive
damages concerning Plaintiffs’ negligence claim and denied, as moot, as to all
other claims.
 
CONCLUSION
Defendants’ demurrer is
sustained with leave to amend as to counts one, three, four, and six, and
sustained without leave to amend as to count five. The motion to strike is
granted with leave to amend, as to the request for punitive damages with
respect to Plaintiffs’ negligence claim and denied, as moot, as to all other
claims. Plaintiff has twenty days to amend.
