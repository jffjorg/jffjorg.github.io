 Case Number:  24STCV10056    Hearing Date:   November 14, 2024    Dept:  55 The Court has reviewed the default judgment package. Plaintiff requests damages in excess of the $100,000 in damages alleged
in the Complaint. Therefore, the proposed judgment must be reduced to include only the amount of damages alleged in the Complaint.
The memorandum of costs includes  $9,800 for “fees paid to
defendant” and $156,400 for  “attorney’s fees due to others due to
defendant,” which are not recoverable as costs and are actually damages. Therefore, costs should be reduced to $535, which includes
the clerk's filing fees ($435) and process server fees ($100).Plaintiff shall file a new default judgment package and the Court will continue the OSC.
