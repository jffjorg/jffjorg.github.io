And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has reviewed the default judgment package and has made a tentative ruling regarding the proposed judgment and costs. The Plaintiff has requested damages in excess of $100,000, which is in excess of the amount alleged in the Complaint. Therefore, the proposed judgment must be reduced to include only the amount of damages alleged in the Complaint. Additionally, the Court has identified unrecoverable fees in the memorandum of costs, including $9,800 for "fees paid to defendant" and $156,400 for "attorney's fees due to others due to defendant." These fees are not recoverable as costs and are actually damages. As a result, the costs should be reduced to $535, which includes the clerk's filing fees ($435) and process server fees ($100). The Plaintiff will need to file a new default judgment package and the Court will continue the OSC (Order to Show Cause).
