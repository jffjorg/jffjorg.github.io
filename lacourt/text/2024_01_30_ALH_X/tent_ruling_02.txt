RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Duan demurrers to each cause of
action in Plaintiff’s complaint. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Xia Lu
(“Plaintiff”) claim that Defendants breached a lease agreement for property
located at 10950 Freer St. Temple City, California (“Subject Property”)
Plaintiff filed this complaint on October 23, 2023, alleging five causes of
action for (1) nonpayment of rent, (2) breach of lease agreement, (3) fraud,
(4) intentional misrepresentation, and (5) promissory estoppel. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Duan’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint is SUSTAINED with 20 days
leave to amend.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
            Demurrer 
 
A general
demurrer may be taken to a complaint where “[t]he pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.” (Code of Civ. Proc. § 430.10(e).) A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747.) In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or by proper judicial
notice.  (Code Civ. Proc. section
430.30(a).)  A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or
other extrinsic matters.  (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153
Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is
whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.  (Hahn v.
Mirda, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Additionally, a
special demurrer to a complaint may be brought on the ground the pleading is
uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible. Code Civ. Proc section 430.10(f); Beresford Neighborhood Assn. v. City of
San Mateo (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1180, 1191.) A demurrer based
on uncertainty is disfavored and will be strictly construed even when the
pleading is uncertain in some respects. (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) A demurrers based on uncertainty are “granted only if
the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably
respond.” (Lickiss v. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (2012) 208
Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Demurrer to Plaintiff’s First and
Second Causes of Action
 
            Duan
objects to Plaintiff’s first cause of action for nonpayment of rent and second
cause of action for breach of contract. Duan argues that Plaintiff failed to
allege facts sufficient to comply with the applicable statute and fails to
allege that he was a party to the contract.
 
            Duan
cites Civil Code section 1951.2, subdivision (a), which provides in part that
“if a lessee of real property breaches the lease and abandons the property
before the end of the term or if his right to possession is terminated by the
lessor because of a breach of the lease, the lease terminates.”
 
            Duan argues
that Plaintiff’s allegations fail because she has failed to established
abandonment pursuant to Civil Code section 1951.3. However, Duan’s arguments
are unavailing. “Material facts alleged in the complaint are
treated as true for the purpose ruling on the demurrer” (Kisesky v.
Carpenters’ Trust for So. California. (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 222, 228.)
Plaintiff alleges Defendants breached the agreement by failing to pay
(Complaint ¶ 22) and abandoned the property
(Complaint ¶ 16.) At the pleading stage, Plaintiff’s allegations are
sufficient.
 
            However, Plaintiff fails to allege that Duan is a party
to the agreement. Plaintiff alleges she entered into a lease with ATL USA,
Inc., and Defendant Anjuan Pan, the owner of ATL. (Complaint ¶ 11.) Plaintiff
does not allege that Duan is a party to the contract or alter ego status.
Plaintiff only alleges that Duan is the chief executive officer of ATL. (Id.
¶ 8.) “The legal fiction of the corporation as an independent entity is
partly intended to insulate corporate officers from personal liability for
corporate contracts.” (Michaelis v. Benavides (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 681,
688.)
 
            Plaintiff has failed to allege the existence of a
contract to which Duan is a party for the purpose of this present action.
Duan’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s first and second causes of action is sustained.
 
            Demurrer to Third and Fourth Causes of Action
 
            Duan demurrers to Plaintiff’s
third cause of action for fraud and fourth cause of action for intentional
misrepresentation.
 
“The elements of fraud, which give
rise to the tort action for deceit, are (a) misrepresentation (false
representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or
‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable
reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Beckwith v. Dahl (2012) 205
Cal.App.4th 1039, 1060, citations omitted.
 
            “The essential
elements of a count for intentional misrepresentation are (1) a
misrepresentation, (2) knowledge of falsity, (3) intent to induce
reliance, (4) actual and justifiable reliance, and (5) resulting damage.”
(Chapman v. Skype Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 217, 230-31.) 
 
            “Each element of a fraud claim must be pleaded with
specificity. [Citation.] ‘The specificity requirement means a plaintiff must
allege facts showing how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the
representations were made, and, in the case of a corporate defendant, the
plaintiff must allege the names of the persons who made the representations,
their authority to speak on behalf of the corporation, to whom they spoke, what
they said or wrote, and when the representation was made.’ ” (Orcilla v. Big
Sur, Inc. (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 982, 1008.) 
 
            Plaintiff’s
allegations in her third and fourth causes of action fail to state fraud claims
with any specificity. Plaintiff’s third cause of action for fraud does not
detail what misrepresentation is alleged. Plaintiff’s fourth cause of action
only alleges that Jinhang Wang made a representation. Other than generally
alleging that all “defendants” engaged in fraudulent conduct, Plaintiff fails
to plead what misrepresentations are alleged, who made the representations,
when the representations were made, or any other factual allegations supporting
her claims. Plaintiff has failed to adequately plead her claims for fraud and
negligent misrepresentation. 
 
            Duan’s
demurrer to Plaintiff’s third and fourth causes of action is sustained.
 
            Demurrer
to Plaintiff’s Fifth Cause of Action
 
            Duan
demurrers to Plaintiff’s fifth cause of action for promissory estoppel.
 
            “ ‘The
elements of a promissory estoppel claim are “(1) a promise clear and unambiguous
in its terms; (2) reliance by the party to whom the promise made; (3) [the]
reliance must be both reasonable and foreseeable; and (4) the party asserting
the estoppel must be injured by his reliance.” ’ ” (Jones v. Wachovia Bank (2014)
230 Cal.App.4th 934, 945.) 
 
            Plaintiff’s
fifth cause of action merely alleges that “Defendant made a promise to pay the
rent on the first day of each month.” (Complaint ¶ 54.) Plaintiff’s fifth cause
of action is a clear attempt to restate her first two causes of action.
Further, Plaintiff fails to allege who made this promise or that Duan is
implicated in this alleged promise. Plaintiff has failed to allege a claim for
promissory estoppel against Duan. 
 
            Duan’s
demurrer to Plaintiff’s fifth cause of action is sustained.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Duan’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint is SUSTAINED with 20 days
leave to amend.
 
            Moving
party to give notice.
