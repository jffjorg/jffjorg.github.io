Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge rules that the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses is granted as to RFP numbers 1 and 2. The defendant, Saven Corporation, is ordered to provide further responses within 20 days of the date of this order. The judge also denies Saven's motions to compel a response and to deem the truth of the matters asserted in its requests for admissions admitted. Furthermore, the judge grants the plaintiff's motion for relief from waiver of objections. The judge emphasizes the importance of reasonable and good faith efforts at informal resolution of discovery disputes and warns the parties against any future efforts to avoid engaging in the discovery process in good faith.
