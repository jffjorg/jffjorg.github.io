```

As for the summary, the judge is considering a motion to stay the action and proceed in Indiana instead of California. The motion is based on a forum selection clause in the contract that requires disputes to be resolved in Indiana. The judge is concerned about whether the clause is mandatory or permissive and whether it would be unfair to enforce it. The judge notes that the parties have stipulated to apply California law in an Indiana court, but that this may not be sufficient to address the concerns about the forum selection clause. The judge is inclined to deny the motion without prejudice due to the deficiencies in the parties' arguments.
