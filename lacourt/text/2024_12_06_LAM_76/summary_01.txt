And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Modernize Remodeling Inc. and Renovateworks Inc. against Roberts' Second Amended Complaint. The judge sustains the demurrer to the third cause of action (declaratory relief) without leave to amend, as declaratory relief is not available to address completed past wrongs. The judge sustains the demurrer to the fourth cause of action (violation of Business and Professions Code, § 17200) with leave to amend, as the complaint does not specify unlawful business practices. The judge grants the motion to strike certain language in the Prayer for Relief regarding punitive damages, attorney fees, and declaratory relief, but denies the motion to strike prejudgment interest. The judge gives the plaintiff 30 days' leave to amend where specified.
