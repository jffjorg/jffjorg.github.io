And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the defendants to clarify the court's ruling on April 3, 2024, or alternatively, to obtain a protective order against additional discovery. The defendants argue that the court's ruling implicitly made clear that only they were entitled to conduct limited discovery, but the judge finds that this claim is belied by the unqualified vacatur of the trial date, discovery cut-off date, and the date to designate expert witnesses and conduct expert witness discovery. The judge denies the defendants' motion for clarification.

The defendants also move for a protective order against additional discovery requests from the plaintiffs, arguing that these requests are unduly burdensome and overbroad. However, the judge finds that the defendants have failed to provide any admissible evidence demonstrating good cause for a protective order, and the motion is denied.

The judge concludes that the defendants' motion is denied in its entirety. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit, and the judge will consider the parties' submissions before making a final ruling.
