On April 15, 2024, Virigina Liu filed
this motion to be relieved as counsel for defendant Lotusan, LLC (“Defendant”)
on the grounds that there has been a total breakdown in communication. Trial is
scheduled for June 16, 2025, and no prejudice will result from the granting of
this motion. However, the proposed order submitted with the motion is
incomplete and does not identify the dates for the trial or final status
conference, nor does it provide the Court with Defendant’s address and
telephone number. 
Accordingly, the hearing on this motion
is continued to _________________ at 8:30 a.m. in Department 3 of the Alhambra
Courthouse. 
A revised proposed order checking Items
3b, 5a, 6, 7, 8, and 9 must be submitted no later than 5 court days before the
date of the next hearing. 
 
Dated
this 16th
day of July, 2024
