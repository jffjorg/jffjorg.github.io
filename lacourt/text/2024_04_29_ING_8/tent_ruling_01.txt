BACKGROUND   A.     Factual    On August 4, 2023,  Plaintiff, Larry Tran (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendants,  Tesla, Inc., Tesla Motors, Inc., and DOES 1 through 10. The Complaint alleges  causes of action for: (1) Breach of Warranty – Song-Beverly Act: Failure  to Repurchase or Replace Consumer Good After Reasonable Number of Repair  Opportunities (Civ. Code § 1793.2(d)); (2) Breach of Warranty – Song-Beverly  Act: Failure to Promptly Repurchase or Replace New Motor Vehicle (Civ. Code, §  1793.2(d)); (3) Breach of Warranty – Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act 15 USC §2301 et  seq.; (4) Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability; (5) Breach of Express  Warranty under the Cal UCC 2313; (6) Strict Liability - Product Liability  Failure to Warn; (7) Strict Liability - Design Defect; (8) Mfg. Defect - Duty  to Warn Negligence; (9) Negligent Misrepresentation; (10) Intentional  Misrepresentation; (11) Concealment; (12) Illegal Tying Arrangement Under the  Cartwright Act; (13) CLRA Civ Code §1770 et seq.; and (14) UCL § 17200. The  Complaint is based on Plaintiff’s June 27, 2020 purchase of a 2013 Tesla Model  S online from AutoNation. (Complaint, ¶ 10.) Plaintiff also alleges the vehicle  was covered under Tesla’s manufacturer’s warranty because it had 97,134 miles  on it. (Complaint, ¶ 13.)               On  March 12, 2024, Plaintiff propounded discovery requests seeking financial discovery  of Tesla. This motion was served on Tesla that same day, and on March 13, 2024  with this Court.           B. Procedural    On March 13, 2024, Plaintiff brought this Motion to Compel Financial  Discovery. On April 16, 2024, Defendant Tesla filed an opposition. On April 22,  2024, Plaintiff filed a reply brief in pro per, his former counsel having been  required to withdraw.   II. EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS    Tesla’s Evidentiary Objections to Declaration of Larry Tran Overrule: 1-12, 15, 18-21   Sustain: 13-14, 16-17   III. ANALYSIS    A.    Legal Standard   A party must respond to a request for production  of documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.  (a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents is directed does  not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order  compelling responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.  (b).) The party also waives the right to make any objections, including one  based on privilege or work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.  (a).) A motion to compel responses is not subject to a 45–day time limit, and the  propounding party does not have to demonstrate either good cause or that it  satisfied a ‘meet and confer’ requirement.”¿ (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,  Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.)¿  Also, “[a] separate statement is not required when no response has been  provided to the request for discovery.”¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b).)    Civil Code  section 3295, subdivision (c), seeks to safeguard the privacy of a defendant’s  financial condition (Kerner v. Superior Court (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 84,  120, 141 Cal.Rptr.3d 504) by prohibiting the plaintiff from seeking pretrial  discovery of a defendant's financial condition or profits “unless the court  enters an order permitting such discovery pursuant to this subdivision” (Civ.Code,  § 3295, subd. (c).)  Section 3295 was  enacted to protect against the premature disclosure of a defendant's financial  condition when punitive damages are sought. (Medo v. Superior Court  (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 64, 67.)  The statute  “has permitted courts to grant a protective order requiring a plaintiff to  produce evidence of a prima facie case of liability for damages under section  3294 before permitting the introduction of evidence of a defendant's profits  and financial condition.”  (Torres v.  Automobile Club of So. California (1997) 15 Cal.4th 771, 777.)  As amended thereafter, section 3295 has  established rules for bifurcating the punitive damages portion of a trial, and  has barred complaints from disclosing any specific dollar amount of punitive  damages being sought.  (Id.)  These restrictions safeguard defendants in  two ways: “[t]he pretrial discovery limits ensure that defendants are not  coerced into settling suits solely to avoid unwarranted intrusions into their  private financial affairs, while the evidentiary restrictions minimize  potential prejudice to the defense in front of a jury.” (College Hospital  Inc. v. Superior Court (1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 712.) Trial courts  have discretion to order a defendant to produce evidence of its financial  condition following a determination of the defendant's liability for  punitive damages, even though the plaintiff had not previously sought pre-trial  discovery, or a trial subpoena of a witness and documents bearing on financial  condition, or a motion to bifurcate punitive damages issues from other issues  at trial.  (Mike Davidov Co. v. Issod  (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 597, 609.)  Section  3295(d) requires a court, on motion by the defendant, to bifurcate a trial so  that the trier of fact is not presented with evidence of the defendant's wealth  and profits until after the issues of liability, compensatory damages, and  malice, oppression, or fraud have been decided in the plaintiff’s favor.  (Torres, supra, 15 Cal.4th at  p. 778.)     B.      Discussion    This Court agrees with Tesla’s opposition brief that this motion  is considerably premature.  The motion  for disclosure of financial records was served the same day as the document  demands seeking that information.  Tesla  had thirty days to provide its responses to Plaintiff’s propounded requests,  i.e., to object, to produce document, or to file a motion for a protective  order.  Compelling production before a  responding party has made a written response is not only premature but also  dubious. Further, there is currently no viable claim for the recovery of  punitive damages in this case, Plaintiff’s former assertion of entitlement to punitive  damages was dismissed on January 4, 2024 when this Court sustained Tesla’s  demurrer to any cause of action for which punitive damages could be  awarded.   While Plaintiff filed an amended pleading,  Tesla’s demurrer to the punitive damages claims in the first amended complaint  is set for hearing on May 16, 2024, so again the motion for financial  information discovery is premature.     On the merits, if the Court were to reach them, the minimalist  showing of a likelihood of success on a punitive damages clam in this matter is  insufficient.  Civil Code section 3295(c)  requires a party seeking pre-trial discovery of financial information bearing  on a punitive damages claim must supply affidavits and other evidence proving malice,  oppression or fraud by clear and convincing proof not only by the defendant,  but in the case of an entity defendant that the fraud (or malice or oppression)  were authorized, ratified, or committed by an officer, director or managing  agent of the entity defendant.  Plaintiff’s  own declaration as to a conversation he asserts to have had with a Tesla  service advisor fails to meet that statutory standard.  There is no showing that service advisor Ranin  Lal is an officer, director, or managing agent; indeed, Plaintiff’s declaration  only asserts that Mr. Lal is a Tesla employee.   Further, Plaintiff’s evidence -- the statement on Mr. Lal’s repair  invoice that having the correct wheels installed is needed for an accurate  calculation of range -- has not been shown at this point to constitute a  fraudulent misrepresentation, much less a showing by clear and convincing  evidence.  While Plaintiff’s declaration  asserts that Mr. Lal’s repair invoice language defrauded him into purchasing  new Tesla tires, the invoice mentions wheels, not tires.  Plaintiff’s declaration also asserts that his  8- year-old Tesla Model S died on the freeway twice while “still showing a  state of charge,” but his evidence fails to show that Mr. Lal lied or that the  alleged lie was a substantial factor in causing the Model S to die on the  freeway.   For the reasons stated above, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel  Financial Discovery is DENIED.  Assuming  that Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint survives Tesla’s pending demurrer to the  fraud cause of action, this ruling is without prejudice to a future motion pursuant  to Civil Code section 3295 either before trial or during trial after Plaintiff  has proven a prima facie case of fraud.     IV.  CONCLUSION    For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Financial  Discovery is DENIED.  Tesla is ordered to  give written notice of this ruling.
