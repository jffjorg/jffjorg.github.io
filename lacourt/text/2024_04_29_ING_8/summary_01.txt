And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel financial discovery. The judge has denied the motion, finding that it is premature and lacks merit.

The judge has stated that the motion is denied without prejudice to a future motion pursuant to Civil Code section 3295 either before trial or during trial after the plaintiff has proven a prima facie case of fraud.
