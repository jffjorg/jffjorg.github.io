litigation privilege to attach to statements in advance of litigation,
contemplated litigation must be imminent; unless and until parties are negotiating
under actual threat of impending litigation, original justification for
litigation privilege of encouraging access to courts can have no relevance in
their communications].)

The “common interest” privilege is a “qualified” one because it also only
applies if the
statement is made “without
malice.”  (Civ. Code, § 47(c).)  Malice can be found to exist if (i) the
statement was motivated by ill will
toward the plaintiff or (ii) the defendant lacked reasonable
grounds for belief the statement was
true, as where the defendant exhibited a willful disregard
or avoidance of accuracy.  (Hailstone v. Martinez (2008) 169
Cal.App.4th 728, 740.)  A series
of heated disagreements between the
parties that preceded the defamatory statement may be
prima facie evidence of ill
will.  (See Hawran v. Hixson (2012)
209 Cal.App.4th 256, 288.)
