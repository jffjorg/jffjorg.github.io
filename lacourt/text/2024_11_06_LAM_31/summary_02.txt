Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Plaintiff's motion to lift the stay of discovery, allowing the Plaintiff to obtain Defendants' responses to previously propounded discovery. The Plaintiff seeks to lift the stay to obtain information necessary to determine the truth of Defendants' anti-SLAPP motion, including the identity of and communications with an "estate attorney" referenced in the anti-SLAPP motion, whether Garrison was seriously considering filing a lawsuit against the Plaintiff, and whether Garrison intended to cause a disruption of the Plaintiff's business relationship with Brad Prescott. The Judge finds good cause exists to lift the stay and sets a status conference for January 10, 2024, to discuss discovery issues.
