* The special power of attorney empowers Irina Ioana Ciochiu to act on Ion Theodor Ciochiu's behalf and represent him before state authorities, control bodies, legal entities, and individuals, but it does not grant her authority to accept service on Ion's behalf.
* The court denied the motion for reconsideration, finding that the motion is based on evidence that could have been presented in connection with the original motion.
