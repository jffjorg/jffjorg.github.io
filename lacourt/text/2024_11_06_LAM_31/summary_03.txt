And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a case involving a defamatory statement made in advance of litigation. The judge is applying the litigation privilege, which attaches to statements made under the actual threat of impending litigation. However, the judge notes that this privilege is qualified, meaning it only applies if the statement was made without malice. Malice can be found to exist if the statement was motivated by ill will or lacked reasonable grounds for belief. The judge also notes that a series of heated disagreements between the parties may be prima facie evidence of ill will. The judge is considering the cases of Edwards v. Centex Real Est. Corp., Hailstone v. Martinez, and Hawran v. Hixson in making this determination.
