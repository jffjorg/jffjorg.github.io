And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the defendants' motions to set aside default judgments. The plaintiff, Kamson, sued the defendants, including Breathless Group LLC, Hagopian, Weinerman, Ho, and Dozer, for breach of contract and fraud arising out of a loan. Default judgments were entered against Dozier and Hagopian, and they have filed motions to set aside these judgments. The judge has granted the plaintiff's request for judicial notice of the defaults, which are court records. The judge notes that relief under California Code of Civil Procedure §473 should be liberally granted, as public policy favors resolution of disputes on the merits rather than through technical default. However, the judge finds that the defendants have failed to provide sufficient evidence or specific facts demonstrating excusable neglect, which is required to set aside a default judgment. The judge denies the defendants' motions to set aside the default judgments, as they were filed nine and five months past the deadline, respectively, and do not meet the requirements of the law.
