Kamson v. Breathless Group LLC,
Case no. 23SMCV01170
Hearing date November 7, 2024
Defendants’
Motions to Vacate Default Judgments
Plaintiff
Kamson sued defendants Breathless Group LLC, Hagopian, Weinerman, Ho and Dozer
for breach of contract and fraud arising out of a loan. Default was entered
against Dozier 7/13/23 and Hagopian on 10/3/23; they move to set aside the
defaults per Code Civ. Proc. §473. 
Plaintiff’s
request for judicial notice of the two defaults is GRANTED, as they are court
records.
Per
Code Civ. Proc. §473(b), the court may set aside a dismissal taken against a
party through “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” Relief
under §473 should be liberally granted because public policy favors resolution
of disputes on the merits, rather than through technical default. E.g., Fasuvi
v. Permatex, Inc. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 681, 685.
Motions
to set aside are to be filed 6 months of entry of default. Defendants Dozier
and Hagopian filed their motions 9/16/24, 9 and 5 months past the deadline,
respectively. Plaintiff argues defendants fail to provide and facts
demonstrating mistake, fraud or inadvertence, as required by Code Civ. Proc.
§473(b). 
Defendants
simply assert “defendant’s default was through excusable neglect in not
responding to plaintiff's complaint.” Hagopian Motion 7:4-5, Dozier Motion
7:4-5. This is insufficient to establish excusable neglect. Defendants fall
outside the time limits of Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §473(b) and fail to provide evidence
or specific facts demonstrating excusable neglect. DENIED.
