Ramos v. Wells Fargo, Case no. 23SMCV04217
Hearing date November 7, 2024
Defendant’s
Demurrer to the SAC
Plaintiff
Myrna Ramos, administrator of decedent Birgitta Sjostrand’s estate, sues
defendant Wells Fargo for fraud and elder abuse arising from an allegedly transfer
of $19,000 from decedent’s account in June 2019. Defendant’s demurrers to the
complaint and FAC were sustained, granting plaintiff leave to amend to allege
facts to show the claim was not barred by the statute of repose. Defendant now
demurs to the SAC. 
Defendant’s
requests for judicial notice of: (1) plaintiff’s 3/15/24 FAC, (2) 7/9/24 minute
order sustaining defendant's demurrer to FAC, (3) plaintiff’s 9/8/23 complaint
and (4) 3/7/24 minute order sustaining defendant's demurrer to the complaint
are granted as court records.
“The
function of a demurrer is to test the sufficiency of the complaint as a matter
of law.” Holiday Matinee, Inc. v. Rambus, Inc. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th
1413, 1420. A complaint “is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather than
evidentiary facts,” Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531,
550, but plaintiff must allege essential facts “with reasonable precision and
with particularity sufficient to acquaint [the] defendant with the nature,
source and extent” of the plaintiff’s claim. Doheny Park Terrace Homeowners
Ass’n., Inc. v. Truck Ins. Exchange (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 1076, 1099.
Defendant
argues the SAC still fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a COA for
fraud and remains uncertain pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §§430.10(e) & (f),
430.50(a), 430.70. Defendant asserts the allegations of fraud still fail the one-year
statute of repose per UCC §11505. Defendant argues the SAC is a sham pleading
that purposefully omits plaintiff’s 2022 discovery of the alleged fraud in an
attempt to plead around the statue of repose, even though the date of discovery
was previously alleged in the FAC. RJN ex. A, paras. 10, 13. 
Plaintiff
argues the UCC does not apply, as it does not cover embezzlement or fraud by
bank employees. This argument is unavailing. Article 4A of the UCC governs wire
transfers and makes no exception for allegations of employee wrongdoing.
Plaintiff cites no authorities to contradict Article 4A. 
Defendant
argues plaintiff still fails to allege sufficient facts to constitute a COA for
fraud against a corporation. Plaintiff must “allege the names of the persons
who made the allegedly fraudulent representations, their authority to speak, to
whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was said or written.” Tarmann
v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.
As
with the prior pleadings, plaintiff alleges she is the administrator of the
estate of Birgitta Sjostrand and alleges $19,000 was fraudulently transferred
from decedent’s account at Wells Fargo to a third party by defendant’s employee
Laila Hamid on 6/19/19. SAC paras. 1-6. The SAC does not allege the date the
alleged fraud was discovered. These allegations are insufficient to constitute
a COA for fraud against a corporation.
Defendant
argues plaintiff fails to allege facts sufficient to constitute a COA for elder
abuse. The court previously sustained defendant’s demurrer to the elder abuse COA
because plaintiff failed to allege facts establishing defendant knew decedent
was over 65 years old and caused her harm as a result. 
There
are three types of financial elder abuse, hinging on whether a person:
“(1)[t]akes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains real or personal
property of an elder or dependent adult for a wrongful use or with intent to
defraud, or both[;] (2)[a]ssists in taking, secreting, appropriating,
obtaining, or retaining real or personal property of an elder or dependent
adult for a wrongful use or with intent to defraud, or both[; and] (3)[t]akes,
secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains, or assists in taking, secreting,
appropriating, obtaining, or retaining, real or personal property of an elder
or dependent adult by undue influence, as defined in Welfare & Institutions
Code § 15610.70.” Welf. & Inst. Code §15610.30. California law “does not
impose liability on a defendant who provides ordinary services that effectuate
financial abuse by a third party.”  Barrett
v. Apple, Inc. (N.D. Cal. Mar. 4, 2021) 523 F.Supp.3d 1132, 1161.
Plaintiff
alleges defendant knew Sjostrand was over 65 years old. SAC para. 14. Plaintiff
alleges defendant transferred funds out of Sjostrand’s account without her
consent. SAC para. 6. Plaintiff alleges Sjostrand suffered harm. SAC paras.
16-17. However, plaintiff offers no allegations that defendant knew Sjostrand
was being defrauded by a third party nor allegations that defendant took and
retained Sjostrand’s property. 
These
allegations are insufficient to constitute a COA for elder abuse. Plaintiff has
been given leave to amend twice. The subsequent failures to sufficiently allege
facts sufficient to constitute COAs weighs against further leave to amend.
SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
