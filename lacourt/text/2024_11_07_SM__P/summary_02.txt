And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, but not for the reasons the defendant had hoped. The Judge found that there are triable issues of fact regarding the duty of care owed to the plaintiff, Barry Rub, and whether the defendant's employee breached that duty by failing to assist Barry out of the tow truck or instruct him on how to safely exit the vehicle. The Judge also found that there is a triable issue of fact regarding what duty of care was owed to Barry Rub, whether it was a regular duty based on a simple negligence standard or a heightened duty of care imposed on a common carrier. As a result, the Judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment.
