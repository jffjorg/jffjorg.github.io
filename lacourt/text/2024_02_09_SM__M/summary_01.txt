And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for attorneys' fees filed by Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs, who are the prevailing parties in the action, seek attorneys' fees in the amount of $1,024,930.00 for prosecuting their action and defending against the cross-complaint. The Defendant has challenged the attorneys' fees as excessive.

The Judge has determined that the Plaintiffs are entitled to attorneys' fees as the prevailing parties, and that the fee award should be based on the lodestar method. The Judge has conducted its own lodestar calculation and found that a reasonable lodestar in this matter is $693,550.00, not inclusive of costs. The Judge has granted the motion in the reduced amount of $693,550.00.

The Judge has also noted that the Plaintiffs' invoices and timesheets provided insufficient information to determine the specific actions of counsel during a time period, and that the Court will need to conduct an independent review of the records to ensure that the attorneys' fees are reasonable.
