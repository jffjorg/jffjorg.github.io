```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the demurrer to the Third Amended Complaint and finds that the demurrer is without merit. The allegations in the complaint state a cause of action under Penal Code section 502(c)(2), which prohibits unauthorized access and copying of data from a computer, computer system, or computer network. The Court finds that Beck's access and copying of data was not within the scope of his employment as an attorney at Strategic Legal Practices APC, but rather for the purpose of establishing a competing law firm. The Court also finds that the plaintiff has properly alleged damages under the statute.

The demurrer is therefore overruled, and the defendant is ordered to file an answer within 20 days.
