The Motion to be

I. BACKGROUND
 
On September
25, 2020, Plaintiff Alta Arcadia Investments, LLC (“Plaintiff” or “Alta”) filed
this action against Defendant Sylvia Wei-Ting Hu (“Sylvia”), Does 1 to 150, and
all persons claiming by, through or under such entities or persons, and all
persons unknown, claiming any legal or equitable right, title, estate, lien or
interest in the real property described in the complaint adverse to Plaintiff’s
title or constituting any cloud on Plaintiff’s title thereto. 
 
The operative
third-amended complaint (“TAC”) was filed on August 3, 2022, Plaintiff alleges
the following causes of action against Defendants Sylvia, Michael C. Yang
(“Yang”), Ricky Hu (“Ricky”), and CalCounties Title Nation Company
(“CalCounties”): 
 
C/A
1: Quiet Title 
C/A
2: Adverse Possession 
C/A
3: Intentional Misrepresentation 
C/A
4: Negligent Misrepresentation
C/A
5: Negligence 
C/A
6: Restitution – Unjust Enrichment 
C/A
7: Breach of Contract 
C/A
8: Negligence 
C/A
9: Indemnification 
 
Plaintiff
alleges that it is the owner of real property in Arcadia, California (the
“Property”). Sylvia
and Yang first acquired title to the Property as joint tenants by quitclaim
deed. After Sylvia and Yang acquired the Property, Sylvia
transferred the Property to Yang by quitclaim on July 7, 1997, as Yang’s sole
and separate property. Thereafter, Yang transferred the Property back to Sylvia
on June 12, 2000 by quitclaim, as her sole and separate property. When the
couple divorced in April 2008 and as part of the dissolution judgment, the
family law court awarded 58.5% of the Property to Sylvia and the remainder to
Yang. Sylvia represented that, around November 2008, she paid for Yang’s interest
in the Property and, subsequently, executed a grant deed dated November 14,
2008, transferring the Property to herself as an unmarried woman. Thereafter,
on April 7, 2009, Sylvia transferred the Property to her nephew Ricky as a
gift, and it was later transferred back to Sylvia on June 3, 2010. On June 11,
2010, Plaintiff received a grant deed to the Property from Sylvia in exchange
for a loan in the amount of $900,000, plus interest, which was duly recorded
due in 18 months. At the time, Plaintiff alleges Sylvia represented that she
was the sole owner of the Property. This representation was false because
Sylvia claims that she did not pay Yang for his share of the Property until
2013. Nevertheless, the loan transaction was arranged by Central Escrow and Sarah
Shun (which Sylvia selected), and, along with Sylvia, prepared and approved all
deeds, agreements, and loan documents related to this transaction and Property.
Sylvia defaulted on the loan. Plaintiff kept the Property as payment for the
outstanding loan balance. Recently, as Plaintiff decided to sell the Property,
it discovered that title was clouded. Sylvia has refused to execute the
statement of information that is required by the title company to clear title. 
 
On August 24,
2023, Sylvia filed a Second Amended cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants
Alta, James Mu, Chang Tsai Mu, Chang An Mu, and Mei Yun Yang, alleging the
following causes of action:
 
C/A
1: Quiet Title (Verified) 
C/A
2: Fraud (Concealment)
 
Sylvia
alleges that, following the dissolution of her marriage with Yang on May 14,
2008, the judgment awarded her with 58.5% of the Property. Thereafter, on June
1, 2010, Sylvia borrowed $900,000 from the Cross-Defendants, and she executed a
promissory note and grant deed against the Property as collateral for the loan.
Sylvia further alleges that, at the time of the execution of these documents,
she informed the Cross-Defendants that she only owned 58.8% of the Property. It
was only until several years later that Yang conveyed his interest to Sylvia.
Thus, when she defaulted on the loan, Sylvia alleges that Cross-Defendants
breached their obligations by improperly keeping the entire Property.
Furthermore, Sylvia alleges that the Cross-Defendants misrepresented that they
would accept 58.5% of the Property.
 
On
September 13, 2024, counsel filed a Motion to be Relieved as Counsel as to Sylvia
Wei-Ting Hu. 
 
No
opposition or other response has been filed. 
 
II. ANALYSIS 
 
A.      Legal
Standard
 
California
Rules¿of Court,¿rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1)
notice of motion and motion to be directed to the client (made on the Notice of
Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil¿form (MC-051)); (2) a
declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under
Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of
Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil¿form (MC-052)); (3) service
of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who
have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel
(prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil¿form (MC-053)).¿ 
 
The¿court has discretion
to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted¿provided
that¿there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly
process of justice.¿¿(See¿Ramirez v.¿Sturdevant¿(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th
904, 915.)¿ 
 
B.      Discussion
Here,
counsel for Defendant Sylvia Wei-Ting Hu seeks relief under Code of Civil
Procedure, Section 284(2). Counsel correctly completed and filed the notice
(Form MC-051) and declaration (MC-052). (Code Civ. Proc., § 284(2); Cal. Rules
Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a) & (c).) In the declaration, counsel
sufficiently explains that this motion is being brought under Section 284(2)
instead of 284(1) because grounds for withdrawal exist, stating that: “Irreconcilable
differences have arisen between myself and the client. This has caused the
relationship to deteriorate in such a manner that I cannot represent the
client. If the Court desire further information on this matter, I am amenable
to an in camera conference.” (Declaration, p. 1.) Counsel served the notice
(MC-051), the declaration (MC-052) and the proposed orders (MC-053) on
Defendant and Plaintiff.
The
Court finds all the requirements for relief have been completed. Additionally,
trial has been scheduled in this case for January 8, 2025. Defendant has a
reasonable amount of time to obtain new counsel, such that she should not be
prejudiced by the withdrawal.
III. DISPOSITION
 
The Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel as to Defendant Sylvia Wei-Ting Hu is GRANTED.
