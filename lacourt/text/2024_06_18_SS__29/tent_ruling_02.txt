LMS Reinforcing Steel USA, LP.
 
Tentative
 
The Court will call this matter and hear
argument.
 
The Court’s
tentative ruling is that the motion is granted based on Hansen
Mechanical, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 20 Cal.App.4th 722 and Nielsen
Construction Co. v. International Iron Products (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 863. This
includes the Court of Appeal’s discussion, in Hansen, of the earlier
decision in City of Oakland v. Delcon Associates (1985) 168 Cal.App.3d
1126, upon which cross-complainant relies.
