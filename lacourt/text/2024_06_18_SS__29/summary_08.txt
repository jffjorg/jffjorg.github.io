And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Jehan Zeb Mir's motion to continue the trial date to December 2024 and to reopen discovery. The court has considered all the evidence in the record and the arguments of counsel. The court has found that no good cause has been shown for a further trial continuance. The case has been ongoing for over three years, and the trial has already been continued five times. The plaintiff has had ample opportunity to conduct discovery and bring discovery motions to the court. The court has denied the motion, and the moving party is ordered to give notice.
