Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino (2005) 35 Cal.4th 180
(“Varian”) is distinguishable. 
(See Motion, pp. 5-6.)  Post-remand,
the defendants filed motions to strike under California’s anti-SLAPP
statute.  The state court denied
the motions.  The question was whether
“the perfecting of an appeal from the denial” of the motions “automatically
stay[ed] all further . . . proceedings on the merits” in the state court.  (Varian, supra, 35 Cal.4th
at 186.)  The California Supreme Court
held that the appeal did trigger an automatic stay.  (See ibid.)
