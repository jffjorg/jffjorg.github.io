Transportation Authority
23STCV08463
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s
Counsel Brian Jacobson, Esq. of Wilshire Law Firm
Tentative
The motion is
denied without prejudice on procedural grounds.
Background
On April 17,
2023, Charlette Ann Lawrence (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Los
Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through
50 for negligence arising out of bus accident on August 22, 2022.
 
On August 14,
2024, Defendant filed an answer and a cross-complaint against Tanesha Anderson
and Roes 1 through 100.
 
On September 25,
2024, Brian Jacobson, Esq. of Wilshire Law
Firm (“Counsel”) filed this motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. No opposition
has been filed. 
 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other. (Code
of Civ. Proc., § 284, subd. (b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw
where conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to
continue the representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct
3-700(C)(1).) “The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to
withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel seeks to
be relieved as Plaintiff’s attorney of record. There are numerous issues with
the filing and service, however.  
First, the proof
of service is not signed.
Second, service
on the client is untimely.  Because of an
intervening court holiday, sixteen court days before the hearing date of
October 17 was September 24.  The motion
was served by mail, which adds five calendar days to the service deadline,
meaning that the last day for service by mail was September 19, 2024.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).)  According to the proof, the client was served
by mail on September 20. 
Third, Counsel
failed to serve Defendant with the motion. That is required.
Fourth, the
motion was not timely filed.  It was
filed on September 25, but sixteen court days before the hearing date was
September 24.
Accordingly, the
motion is DENIED without prejudice.
Conclusion
 
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is DENIED without prejudice.  
 
Moving counsel
to give notice.
