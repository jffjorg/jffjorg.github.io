And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has released a tentative ruling before the hearing on October 17, 2024, in the case of Topete v. J.S. Multani Subway. The Judge intends to discuss several issues with the parties' counsel before the hearing, and may need to grant a brief continuance. The issues include the Court's lack of certain evidence, Plaintiff's inability to obtain essential facts, and Defendant's objections to some of Plaintiff's evidence. The Judge also notes that Plaintiff is representing herself in pro per and may need an opportunity to address and cure certain evidentiary objections. The Judge is seeking clarification on whether Plaintiff is requesting a continuance based on her inability to obtain essential facts, and whether she is seeking to use Defendant's discovery responses as evidence. The Judge intends to hear from the parties' counsel regarding these issues before making a final ruling.
