Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the action. The plaintiff failed to appear at three consecutive court hearings, and the motion was filed more than six months after the dismissal order was entered. The judge found that the motion was not filed within the time limit specified in the statute, and therefore did not have the power or discretion to grant the motion.
