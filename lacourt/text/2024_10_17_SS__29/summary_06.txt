And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the motion to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiff without prejudice due to procedural issues. The motion was not properly served on the client and the defendant, and it was not timely filed. Additionally, the proof of service is not signed. The court emphasizes that an attorney can be relieved as counsel under certain circumstances, such as conflicts between the attorney and client, but the motion must be properly filed and served. The court has given notice to the moving counsel to take further action.
