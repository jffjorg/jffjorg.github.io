The court has granted the petition for minor's compromise, which seeks approval for a settlement between the minor claimant, Divine Leggett, and the defendants, Michael Wilk, A&M Real Estate, Shelly A. McClellan, and Bradly Homan. The settlement terms are as follows: the minor claimant will receive $68,750.00 out of a total settlement of $137,500.00, with $17,187.50 deducted for attorneys' fees, resulting in a net settlement of $51,562.50. The settlement funds will be placed in a blocked account. The court finds the settlement fair in light of the alleged injuries sustained by the claimant and the attorney's fees and costs reasonable.
