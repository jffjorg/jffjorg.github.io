And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Karen Bobadilla vs. Nordstrom Card Services, Inc. The defendant has moved to compel further responses to requests for production of documents and to compel the plaintiff to sit for a second day of deposition. The plaintiff has opposed the motion, arguing that the requests are overbroad and would unnecessarily intrude on her privacy.

The judge has denied the defendant's motion. The judge finds that the defendant has not shown good cause for the requests and that the plaintiff's objections are justified. The judge also notes that the defendant failed to notice a second day of deposition and that the plaintiff has already testified regarding how often she used her phone and internet for work.

The judge concludes that the defendant's motion is denied and that the plaintiff will not be required to produce her entire internet and phone history or sit for a second day of deposition.
