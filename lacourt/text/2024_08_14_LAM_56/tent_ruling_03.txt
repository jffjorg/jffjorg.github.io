[1] The Court notes
that the circumstances of the claim in Rowland are significantly
different from those in the instant cases. 
Rowland involved a claim by a plaintiff invitee against the
defendant arising from an injury allegedly caused by a broken faucet handle in
defendant’s apartment. (Rowland at p. 110.)


[2]           The Court recognizes that in Lawndale
the Court found that the claim for failure to report was the appropriate
subject for a motion for summary adjudication because the plaintiff there had
not established that a mandatory reporter actually knew of the abuse. (Lawndale,
at pp. 138-143.) Here, however, because A.C. and A.Z. testified that they had
informed a mandatory reporter of the abuse before April 4, 2019, there is a
triable issue of material fact as to whether a mandatory reporter actually knew
of the abuse before the ripped-pants incident. 
Therefore, summary adjudication as to the Fifth Cause of Action of
Plaintiff A.C.’s First Amended Complaint for Breach of Mandatory Duty to Report
is unwarranted.
