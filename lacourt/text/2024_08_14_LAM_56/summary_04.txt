And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to file a third amended complaint. The plaintiff is seeking to add Catherine Durickas as a defendant and to add additional causes of action. The motion is unopposed and the judge finds that the plaintiff has complied with the necessary procedural requirements. The judge notes that the proposed amended pleading is entirely different from the original pleading and does not contain any allegations. The judge also finds that the defendant would not be prejudiced by allowing the amendment. The judge orders that the third amended complaint be filed and served within 15 days of the order. The judge also notes that if the new defendant seeks additional time for discovery, the trial will be continued.
