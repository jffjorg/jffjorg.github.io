```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the circumstances of the case and has determined that summary adjudication is not warranted for the Fifth Cause of Action of Plaintiff A.C.'s First Amended Complaint for Breach of Mandatory Duty to Report. The court recognized that the circumstances of the case are different from those in the Rowland and Lawndale cases. In Lawndale, the court found that the claim for failure to report was appropriate for summary adjudication because the plaintiff had not established that a mandatory reporter actually knew of the abuse. However, in this case, A.C. and A.Z. testified that they informed a mandatory reporter of the abuse before April 4, 2019, which creates a triable issue of material fact as to whether a mandatory reporter actually knew of the abuse before the ripped-pants incident. Therefore, summary adjudication is unwarranted.
