And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the plaintiff's complaint and the defendant's demurrer and motion to strike. The judge finds that the complaint fails to allege the elements of any recognized cause of action against the defendant. The judge has sustained the demurrer with 30 days' leave to amend. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff's opposition to the demurrer and motion to strike was late and did not address the issues in the demurrer and motion to strike. The judge suggests that the plaintiff may wish to consult with an attorney or a self-help center to assist with the pleading requirements.
