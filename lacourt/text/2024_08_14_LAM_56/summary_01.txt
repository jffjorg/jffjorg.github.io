And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer and motion to strike filed by defendant Contemporary Services Corp. and has determined that the case should be continued to allow plaintiff Timothy Settles to file a substantive opposition. The court notes that plaintiff is under the mistaken belief that defendant is in default, but in fact, plaintiff's request for default was rejected and no subsequent request for default was submitted or entered by the court. As a result, defendant is not in default and has appeared in the case by filing the demurrer and motion to strike. The court wishes to determine the merits of the case rather than by a party's erroneous failure to oppose, and has continued the hearing to August 14, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. to allow plaintiff to file a substantive opposition.
