Summary:

The Judge issued a tentative ruling in the case of Michael Treiman v. Hayman Holdings, LLC. The case involves a dispute over the use of Lehi funds, which were used to satisfy a judgment against the Defendant's owner, Robert Hayman. The Plaintiff, Michael Treiman, claims that the Lehi funds were wrongfully taken from him and seeks their return. The Defendant, Hayman Holdings, LLC, argues that the Plaintiff is judicially estopped from making this claim because he previously took the position that the Lehi funds were used to satisfy the judgment.

The Judge ruled that the Plaintiff's claim is frivolous and that he is judicially estopped from making this claim. The Judge sustained the Defendant's demurrer without leave to amend and granted the Defendant's motion for sanctions, ordering the Plaintiff to pay $15,000 in attorney's fees to the Defendant's counsel.
