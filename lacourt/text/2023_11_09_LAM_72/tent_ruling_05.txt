TENTATIVE RULING
 



BURLESQUE ENTERPRISES, INC.,
 
                                  Plaintiff,
  
         v.
 
 
THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES et al.,
 
                                  Defendants.
 


 Case No:  23STCV14032
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  November 9, 2023
 Calendar
  Number:  5



 
On August 31, 2023, defendant City of Los Angeles
(“Defendant”) demurred to the Complaint filed by plaintiff Burlesque
Enterprises, Inc. (“Plaintiff”).  On the
same day, Defendant filed a motion to strike.
 
          Plaintiff has
filed an opposition on both matters, and Defendant has filed replies.
 
          One of the
key issues raised by Defendant is the asserted res judicata and collateral
estoppel effects of a lawsuit entitled Burlesque v. City of Los Angeles,  LASC Case No. 21STCV40709 (“Prior
Action”).  Defendant has asked the Court
to take judicial notice of the Prior Action, and the Court does so.
 
          Judgment in
favor of Defendant in the Prior Action is currently on appeal.  It appears that the date set for argument
will take place before the end of this year, and then the Court of Appeal will
issue its decision within three months thereafter.  The outcome of the appeal in the Prior Action
may substantially affect the merits of the current action.
 
          Accordingly,
the Court issues the following orders:
 
1.    
Pending the next hearing, the Court
stays the current lawsuit.
2.    
The Court sets a status conference re
appeal for April 16, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.  
The parties are requested to promptly bring to the Court’s attention any
decision in the appeal of the Prior Action.
3.    
The Court continues the hearing on Defendant’s
demurrer and motion to strike to April 16, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
 
Defendant will give notice.
