Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the Landlord Parties' motion to compel further responses to discovery requests served on Tenant, but denies the motion with respect to Tavitian's requests to Tenant, Landlord's requests to Winsen, and Tavitian's request to Winsen. The court finds that summary judgment has been granted on the cross-claims, making some of the discovery requests moot.

The court orders Tenant to provide further written responses and responsive documents within 30 days, as well as a privilege log for all documents withheld on the basis of privilege. The court also orders Tenant to pay attorney's fees of $5,835 directly to Landlord's counsel within 30 days.

The court declines to impose sanctions on Winsen, finding that it would be unjust to sanction Winsen for failing to respond to discovery requests that were only relevant due to the cross-claims that have been resolved through summary judgment.
