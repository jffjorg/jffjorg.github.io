And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in a lawsuit between Burlesque Enterprises, Inc. (plaintiff) and the City of Los Angeles et al. (defendant). The defendant has demurred to the complaint and filed a motion to strike, which the plaintiff has opposed. The court has taken judicial notice of a prior lawsuit between the same parties, which is currently on appeal. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the appeal, the court has decided to stay the current lawsuit pending the next hearing. The court has also set a status conference for April 16, 2024, to discuss the appeal and will continue the hearing on the defendant's demurrer and motion to strike at the same time.
