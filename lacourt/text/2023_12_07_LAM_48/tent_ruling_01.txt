[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO COMPLY
  WITH RECORDS SUBPOENAS
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 7, 2023



 
On August 12, 2020, Plaintiffs
Jane Doe L.P. (a minor by and through her guardian ad litem Elizabeth P.) and Elizabeth
P. filed this action against Downey Unified School District.
In
response to Form Interrogatories about injuries and the treaters for injuries, Doe
L.P. alleged emotional distress, depression, and anxiety, which she sought mental
health treatment for.  (Motions at p. 3; Ovitz
Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. A.)
On
September 25, 2023, Defendant issued deposition subpoenas for production of business
records to non-parties South Central Los Angeles Regional Center and Kaiser Permanente.  (Motions at pp. 3-4; Ovitz Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. B.)  Doe L.P. objected to the subpoenas.
On
November 7, 2023, Defendant filed motions to compel South Central Los Angeles Regional
Center’s and Kaiser Permanente’s compliance with the subpoenas.  Plaintiffs did not file any oppositions.
A
party may move to compel compliance with a subpoena for business records served
on a non-party.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1987.1,
2020.410.)
The
subpoenas request production of (1) all medical records and reports that pertain
to care and treatment, (2) all billing and payment records, and (3) all psychological
and/or psychiatric reports that are limited to depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders.
These
records are relevant for Doe L.P.’s allegations of “severe emotional distress and
injury in mind and body including, but not limited to, physical injury, including
fearfulness, mental anguish, anxiety, [and] sleeplessness.”  (Complaint ¶ 26; see Complaint ¶¶ 32, 39, 49,
60.)  Plaintiff’s mental and emotional condition
is directly relevant to her claims, so she has waived her right to privacy as it
relates to the alleged harms.  (Vinson
v. Superior Court (1987) 43 Cal.3d 833, 842.)
The
motions to compel are GRANTED.  South Central
Los Angeles Regional Center and Kaiser Permanente are ordered to comply with the
records subpoenas within 14 days of this order.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
