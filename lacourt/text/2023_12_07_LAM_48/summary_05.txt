And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to deem the requests for admissions (RFAs) admitted as to Hunter Dodge, as they failed to serve responses in a timely manner. The judge denies the motion to deem RFAs admitted as to FCA, as they served responses after the motion was filed. The judge also grants the request for sanctions against FCA for their late service of responses. The sanctions are $1,316.75, which must be paid by each party's counsel within 30 days.
