And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel compliance with records subpoenas issued to non-parties South Central Los Angeles Regional Center and Kaiser Permanente. The subpoenas seek production of business records related to the plaintiff's injuries, including medical records, billing and payment records, and psychological and psychiatric reports. The court finds that the subpoenas are relevant to the plaintiff's claims of emotional distress, depression, and anxiety, and that the plaintiff has waived her right to privacy as it relates to the alleged harms. Therefore, the non-parties are ordered to comply with the subpoenas within 14 days of this order.
