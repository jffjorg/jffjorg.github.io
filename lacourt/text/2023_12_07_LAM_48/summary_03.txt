And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Thomas D. Long, has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Dylan Scott Perry's Motion to Strike. The Motion was filed on November 6, 2023, without opposition or reply brief. The Judge found that the Motion fails to identify what filing is the target of the Motion, fails to specify a passage, page, or paragraph the movant is intending to strike, and is unintelligible and fails to articulate a cognizable ground on which any of Defendant's filings should be struck. The Judge also notes that the Meet and Confer process was not followed, and that the Motion falls outside the timing constraints articulated in the California Code of Civil Procedure. As a result, the Motion is denied.
