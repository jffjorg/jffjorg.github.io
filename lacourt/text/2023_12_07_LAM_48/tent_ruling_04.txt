[1] In
addition to service of the summons and complaint being improper, it appears
that the Motion to Strike falls outside of the timing constraints articulated
in CRC 3.1322(b) and CCP § 435(b)(1). Additionally, the operative Motion to
Strike is Plaintiff’s fifth, there is no evidence that leave of court was
sought nor granted to file the instant Motion filed on 11/6/23.
