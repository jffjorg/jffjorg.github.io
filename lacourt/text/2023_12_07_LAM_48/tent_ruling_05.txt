On
August 29, 2023, Plaintiff Melissa Bontempt served Defendants FCA US LLC and Axis
Automotive Group LLC dba Hunter Dodge Chrysler Jeep Ram Fiat and HW Hunter Dodge
Ram (“Hunter Dodge”) with Requests for Admissions.  Defendants did not serve responses.
On
November 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed motions to deem the truth of all matters in Request
for Admissions admitted.
On
November 27, 2023, FCA served responses.
When
a party fails to timely respond to a request for admission, the propounding party
may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party who failed to respond waives any objections
to the demand, unless the court grants them relief from the waiver, upon a showing
that the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially compliant response, and
(2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence,
or excusable neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)  The court shall
grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the
party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the
hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is
in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
Hunter
Dodge filed no opposition to the motion and did not serve timely responses.  Therefore, it does not appear that Hunter Dodge
served substantially compliant responses prior to the hearing.  The motion to deem Requests for Admission admitted
bv Hunter Dodge is GRANTED.
Because
Defendant FCA has now served responses, that motion is DENIED.
The
Court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even where the requested discovery was provided to
the moving party after the motion was filed. 
(California Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).)  FCA’s late service of responses—only in response
to Plaintiff’s motion—warrants sanctions.
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions of $1,316.75 for each motion is granted.
Hunter
Dodge’s counsel is ordered to pay sanctions of $1,316.75 to Plaintiff within 30
days.
FCA’s
counsel is ordered to pay sanctions of $1,316.75 to Plaintiff within 30 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
