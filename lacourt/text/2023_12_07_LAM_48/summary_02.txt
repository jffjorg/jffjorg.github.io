And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, City of Los Angeles, has moved for summary judgment in this case, arguing that there is no evidence to support the plaintiff, Vincenzo Averaimo's, claims of discrimination and retaliation. The judge has granted the motion, finding that the defendant has met its burden of showing a legitimate and non-discriminatory reason for demoting and reassigning the plaintiff.

The plaintiff had alleged that he was discriminated against and retaliated against based on his sexual orientation, but the judge found that there is no evidence to support these claims. The judge also found that the defendant's reason for demoting and reassigning the plaintiff, based on his history of complaints and failure to report his detention by Pasadena PD, is legitimate and nondiscriminatory.

The judge also granted summary adjudication of the third cause of action, which alleged failure to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination and retaliation, finding that because there was no discrimination or retaliation, the defendant cannot be liable for failing to prevent it.

The judge's ruling is based on the evidence presented, including the plaintiff's own testimony and the defendant's evidence of the legitimate and non-discriminatory reason for demoting and reassigning the plaintiff. The judge's ruling is final unless one of the parties files a written objection within five days.
