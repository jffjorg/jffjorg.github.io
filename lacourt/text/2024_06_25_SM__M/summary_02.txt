And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion filed by Dirk O. Julander and M. Adam Tate, counsel for plaintiff La Verne Rambla LLC, to be relieved as counsel of record. The motion is based on an irreparable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship due to the client's refusal to pay incurred legal fees. The judge finds that the client will likely not be prejudiced by the withdrawal, as no trial is set and no dispositive motions are on calendar. Therefore, the judge is tentatively granting the motion.
