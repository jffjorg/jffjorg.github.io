Summary:

The Judge is considering a motion for terminating sanctions against Defendant John M. Perez, filed by Plaintiffs Daniel Zarabi, Shirin Nourollah, and Parvin Nourollah. The Plaintiffs argue that Defendant Perez failed to provide discovery responses and refused to cooperate with the Court's order compelling him to provide further discovery responses and appear for his deposition. The Court finds that Defendant Perez's conduct is willful and that lesser sanctions, such as monetary sanctions, have been ineffective in compelling him to answer discovery. The Court grants the motion for terminating sanctions in part, striking Defendant Perez's answer insofar as it denies the complaint's allegations of liability and causation.
