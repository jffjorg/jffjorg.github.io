And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The case is a breach of rental agreement action, and the plaintiffs, Gonzalo R. Vazquez and Leticia Vazquez, are seeking a default judgment against the defendants, Arcadio Toribio and Joanna Aranda, in the amount of $24,505.43. However, the judge finds that the evidence submitted by the plaintiffs does not adequately support the amount of damages requested, as it is unclear how the amount of $20,628.00 was determined. Additionally, the judge notes that the plaintiffs' prejudgment interest calculation and attorney fees calculation are incorrect, and that it is unclear if the plaintiffs are entitled to attorney fees. Therefore, the judge has denied the request for entry of default judgment without prejudice, allowing the parties to submit further evidence or arguments.
