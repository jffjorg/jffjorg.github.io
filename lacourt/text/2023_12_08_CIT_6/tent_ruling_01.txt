  Case Number:  22PSCV01016    Hearing Date:   December 8, 2023    Dept:  6 Plaintiffs Gonzalo R. Vazuez and Leticia Vazquez’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment Defendants:  Arcadio Toribio and Joanna Aranda TENTATIVE RULING            The Court DENIES the request for entry of default judgment without prejudice.           BACKGROUND            This is a breach of rental agreement action. On September 8, 2022, plaintiffs Gonzalo R. Vazquez and Leticia Vazquez (collectively, Plaintiffs) filed this action against defendants Arcadio Toribio, Joanna Aranda (collectively, Defendants), and Does 1 through 50, alleging causes of action for breach of contract and common counts. Default was entered against the Defendants on May 2, 2023. Plaintiffs filed the instant request for entry of default judgment on October 6, 2023.           LEGAL STANDARDCode of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) ANALYSISPlaintiffs seek default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $24,505.43, including $20,628.00 in damages, $2,198.43 in interest, $1,009.00 in attorney fees, and $670.00 in costs. The Court finds that the evidence Plaintiffs submitted does not adequately support the amount of damages requested. More specifically, it is unclear how the amount of $20,628.00 was determined. While the Court understands that the combined rent for both properties at issue was $3,240.00 a month for the period of February 1, 2022 to September 10, 2022, that still does not explain how the amount of $20,628.00 was determined. $3,240.00 a month for seven months, i.e., from February 2022 to August 2022, equals $22,680.00. Ten days into September, i.e., one-third of that month, would appear to equal $1,080.00. The combination of those two amounts would be $23,760.00. Plaintiffs have not provided any evidence indicating partial payments from Defendants, nor have they provided any proration calculations either. Furthermore, even assuming for the sake of argument that the principal damages amount of $20,628.00 was correct, Plaintiffs’ prejudgment interest calculation and attorney fees calculation are incorrect, albeit by nominal amounts. 389 days multiplied by $5.65 equals $2,197.85 rather than $2,198.43. $318.84, i.e., 3% of $10,628.00, plus $690.00 equals $1008.84 rather than $1009.00. (Local Rule 3.214.) It is also unclear if Plaintiffs are entitled to attorney fees, as paragraph 36, subdivision (A), of the subject lease agreement provides that the parties must first engage in mediation or at least attempt to engage in mediation to preserve their right to recover attorney fees thereunder. (Leticia Vazquez Decl., Ex. 1, ¶ 36, subd. (A).) Plaintiffs have not provided any evidence indicating they attempted mediation before filing this action. CONCLUSION               Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES the request for entry of default judgment without prejudice.
