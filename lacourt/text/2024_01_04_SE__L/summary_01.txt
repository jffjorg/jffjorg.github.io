The judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff's motion to strike the answer filed by the defendant, CLPM, INC., is dropped as moot. The motion was filed on October 5, 2023, and the notice of lodging the answer was filed on December 1, 2023. However, as of January 2, 2024, no answer has been filed by the defendant. The motion is therefore dropped as moot, and the moving party is instructed to give notice. The ruling is based on California Civil Procedure Code (CCP) §436, which outlines the grounds for a motion to strike.
