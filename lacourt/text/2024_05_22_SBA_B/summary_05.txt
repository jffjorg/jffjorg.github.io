```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion for trial preference brought by plaintiff Gloria Caldwell, who is 86 years old and has various health issues, including arthritis, dementia, and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. The plaintiff is under hospice care and claims that it is unlikely she will survive before the case is brought to trial if preference is not granted. The court finds that the plaintiff has satisfied the requirements for preference under Code of Civil Procedure section 36, which requires that the party be over 70 years old and have a substantial interest in the action, and that their health be such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing their interest in the litigation. The court finds that the plaintiff has met the burden of showing that she is at least 70 years old and has health problems that may prejudice her interests in the litigation. The court grants the motion and will set a trial date within 120 days of the hearing on this order.
