Motion
to Set Aside Default 
 
            The court considered the moving
papers. No oppositions papers were filed. 
RULING
            The motion is GRANTED. 
BACKGROUND
            On December 19, 2023, Michael Hecht
filed his complaint against Joseph Arnao and Mina Arnao asserting a single
cause of action for motor vehicle. On January 10, 2024, plaintiff filed an
amendment to complaint substituting Sophia Mei Arnao for Doe 1.
            Default was entered as to defendants
on April 10, 2024.
            On April 24, 2024, defendants filed
the instant motion to set aside default. 
            No opposition has been filed.  
LEGAL AUTHORITY
Per CCP § 473,
subdivision (b), a court may relieve a party or his counsel from a dismissal
against him because of his “mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” When
a party seeks relief “no more than six months after entry of judgment, is in
proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney's sworn affidavit attesting to
his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any (1)
resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her client, and which
will result in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting default judgment
or dismissal entered against his or her client, unless the court finds that the
default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney's mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” CCP § 473. And when such relief is
available, “there is a strong public policy in favor of granting relief and
allowing the requesting party his or her day in court.” Rappleyea v.
Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 981-982, internal quotations omitted.
 
DISCUSSION
            In
support of defendants’ motion to set aside, defendants provide the declaration
of their attorney, K. Robert Gonter, Jr. 
Counsel
declares, in relevant part, the following. On January 25, 2024, defendant
Joseph Arnao notified his insurance carrier that plaintiff served defendants
with the Summons and Complaint. Gonter Decl. ¶ 5. On April 17, 2024, the insurance
carrier forwarded the Complaint to defense counsel. Id. ¶ 7. On April
19, 2024, defense counsel called plaintiff’s counsel to see if he would grant
an extension to file a responsive pleading, which was rejected; at that time,
the court’s docket reflected plaintiff’s request for entry of default had been
rejected. Id. ¶ 9. On
April 22, 2024, defense counsel received a rejection for an answer filed on
April 19, 2024, because a request for entry of default had been filed on April
10, 2024. This was the first time the defense learned of the default entry. Id. ¶ 10. 
            Here,
the court is inclined to grant the motion based on the inadvertent mistake by
defendants’ insurer and counsel to timely file an answer. As provided above, on
January 25, 2024, defendant Joseph Arnao communicated with his insurer that
defendants were served with the Summons and Complaint, but the insurer did not
forward such to defense counsel until April 17, 2024. Defense counsel received
this file a week after plaintiff filed the requests for default, and counsel
only learned of the request for default being filed when the answer was
rejected on April 22, 2024. Consequently, defense counsel moved promptly to
file the instant motion, which is timely. Further, no opposition is presented. 
 
ORDER
            Accordingly,
the motion is GRANTED.
            Moving
party is ordered to give notice of ruling.
