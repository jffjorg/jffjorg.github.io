RULING
            Summary adjudication is GRANTED as to the first cause of action for

BACKGROUND
            On June 27, 2023, plaintiff filed
its complaint against defendant for (1) breach of contract; (2) open book
account; (3) account stated; (4) goods sold and delivered; and (5) money had
and received. Plaintiff alleges that it supplied defendant with computer goods
which defendant has refused to pay for. 
            On August 15, 2023, defendant filed
its answer. 
            On February 15, 2024, plaintiff
filed the instant motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. 
            No opposition has been filed. 
LEGAL AUTHORITY
“The purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts
with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine
whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their
dispute.” Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal. 4th 826, 843.
“A party may move for summary judgment in an action or proceeding if it is
contended that the action has no merit or that there is no defense to the
action or proceeding.” CCP § 473c subd. (a)(1).
“The motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted
show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving
party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” CCP § 473c subd. (c).
Where the plaintiff has also moved for summary judgment that party
has the burden of showing there is no defense to a cause of action. CCP § 437c,
subd. (a). That burden can be met if the plaintiff “has proved each element of
the cause of action entitling the party to judgment on that cause of action.” CCP
§ 437c, subd. (p)(1). If the plaintiff meets this burden,
it is up to the defendant “to show that a triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.” S.B.C.C.,
Inc. v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 383,
388.
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff
moves for summary judgment as to the action or for summary adjudication against
defendant on its first cause of action for breach of contract. 
            First
Cause of Action for Breach of Contract Against Defendant
“[T]he
elements of a cause of action for breach of contract are (1) the existence of
the contract, (2) plaintiff's performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” Oasis
West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821.
As to the first element—the existence of a contract—plaintiff sets
forth in the separate statement that plaintiff agreed to provide defendant with
computer products and defendant agreed to pay plaintiff $8,038.83, $1,087.52,
and $189,753.02 for the products, as evidenced by invoice numbers 542266-1, 542112-1, and 543071,
respectively. Separate Statement, p. 2, UMF Nos. 1-3. Furthermore, plaintiff’s
evidence provides that defendant does not deny that the three invoices
constitute or evidence enforceable contracts that are binding on defendant. Id.
p. 2, UMF No. 4. Based on the foregoing, the court finds that plaintiff has
established the existence of a valid contract between plaintiff and defendant. 
As to the second element—plaintiff's performance
or excuse for nonperformance—plaintiff sets forth in the separate statement
that it performed its obligations to defendant by delivering to defendant the
computer products described in the three invoices. Id. p. 4, UMF Nos. 13-15.
Plaintiff’s evidence also provides that defendant used the subject computer
products in the ordinary course of defendant’s business and that defendant
acknowledged that it has not paid plaintiff in connection with the three
invoices. Id. p. 5, UMF Nos. 19-20. The court finds plaintiff makes a
prima facie showing that it performed under the contract based on the evidence
presented. 
As to the third element—defendant's breach—plaintiff sets forth in
the separate statement that defendant breached the contract with plaintiff by
failing to pay plaintiff the $8,038.83, $1,087.52, and $189,753.02 owed to
plaintiff per the three invoices.
Id. pp. 5-6, UMF Nos. 21-23. As
set forth above, defendant acknowledged that it owes plaintiff these amounts. Id.
pp. 5-6, UMF Nos. 20, 24-26. Defendant does not dispute that it failed to pay
plaintiff for the subject computer products. Id. p. 6, UMF Nos. 27.
Based on the foregoing, the court finds that plaintiff makes a prima facie
showing that defendant breached the contract between plaintiff and defendant. 
Plaintiff has also demonstrated the fourth and
final element—the resulting damages to the plaintiff—given the evidence already
put forth by plaintiff. Specifically, plaintiff has been damaged in the total
amount of $198,879.37
due to defendant’s failure to pay plaintiff for the subject computer products. Id. p. 7, UMF Nos. 31.
            Accordingly,
the court finds that plaintiff has satisfied its initial burden of showing there is no defense to the first cause of action for
breach of contract by proving each element of the claim. 
            The burden shifts to defendant to present a triable issue
of material fact. Defendant offers no opposition
to the motion and, as such, has not presented evidence to raise a triable issue
of material fact.[1] Plaintiff is therefore entitled to judgment as a
matter of law as to the first cause of action for breach of contract against
defendant.
ORDER
            Summary
adjudication is GRANTED as to the first cause of action for breach of contract.

            Moving
party is ordered to give notice of ruling.
