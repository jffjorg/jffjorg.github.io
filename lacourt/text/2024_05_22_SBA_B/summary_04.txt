And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court finds that the defendant's attempt to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's Song Beverly Consumer Warranty Claims based on the Lease Agreement is not persuasive. The court agrees with the Ford Motor Warranty Cases that the doctrine of equitable estoppel does not apply in this situation. The court also disagrees with the reasoning of Felisilda v. FCA US LLC, which held that a nonsignatory manufacturer can rely on equitable estoppel. The court concludes that the plaintiff's Song Beverly Consumer Warranty Claims are not "inextricably intertwined" with the Lease Agreement and therefore cannot be compelled to arbitrate.
