Had Defendant’s request to arbitrate under the Warranty Booklet failed, its
attempt to compel arbitration pursuant to the Sale Contract would have been
denied.  The Court finds the reasoning of
the Ford Warranty Motor Cases persuasive. 
There is currently a split in authority regarding whether a nonsignatory
manufacturer may rely on equitable estoppel to compel arbitration of Song
Beverly Consumer Warranty Claims based on an arbitration provision contained in
the vehicle sale or lease contract.  The
issue is currently under review by the California Supreme Court.             
 
While Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th
486, 495 answered this question in the affirmative, a line of more recent cases
have disagreed with its reasoning.  
These cases include Davis v. Nissan North America, Inc. (2024) 100
Cal.App.5th 825, 319 Cal.Rptr.3d 517, 527-528 (noting Supreme Corut review of
issue and exercising discretion to follow Ford Motor Warranty Cases and
rejecting Felisilda); Yeh v. Supr. Ct. (2023) 95 Cal.App. 5th 264, Kielar v.
Supr. Ct. (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 614, 619-620 (review granted Oct. 25, 2023),
Montemayor v. Ford Motor Co. (2023) 92 Cal.Ap.5th 958, 968-971 (review granted
Sep. 20, 2023), Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, 1333-1336
(review granted July 19, 2023 S279969), Ngo v. BMW of North America, LLC (2022)
23 F.4th 942, 946 and Jurosky v. BMW North America, LLC (2020) 441 F.Supp.3d
963.    
 
As explained in Kielar, “[i]n affirming the superior
court's decision to order the entire case to arbitration based on the doctrine
of equitable estoppel, a panel of this court explained ‘the sales contract was
the source of the warranties at the heart of this case.’ (Citation
omitted)  We join Ford Motor and
Montemayor in disagreeing with this statement and concluding equitable estoppel
does not apply in this situation.”  (Kielar,
supra, 94 Cal.App.5th at 619.)  
 
The reasoning of the Ford Motor Warranty Cases line of
cases is persuasive.  Plaintiff’s Song
Beverly Consumer Warranty Claims are not “inextricably intertwined” with the
Lease Agreement.  The mere fact that
there would be no express or implied warranties to sue upon “but for” the Lease
Agreement is insufficient to equitably estop Plaintiff from refusing to
arbitrate its Song Beverly Consumer Warranty and negligent repair claims
against Defendant.
