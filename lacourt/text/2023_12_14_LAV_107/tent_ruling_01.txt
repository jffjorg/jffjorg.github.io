  Case Number:  23VECV03766    Hearing Date:   December 14, 2023    Dept:  107 [Tentative] Ruling
 
Defendant Anita Clark’s Demurrer to Unlawful Detainer Complaint is
OVERRULED.
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Marisa Brown, Trustee of the Brown Family Trust (“Plaintiff”)
entered into a one-year written lease agreement with Defendant Anita Clark
(“Defendant”) for monthly rent payments of $3,850.00. Defendant was served with
a three-day notice to rent or quit on August 15, 2023, with past-due rent in
the amount of $19,250.00 from April 1, 2023, through August 31, 2023. 
 
On August 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint for Unlawful Detainer
(“CUD”). Plaintiff requests past-due rent of $19,250.00, reasonable attorney’s
fees, forfeiture of the agreement, and the fair rental value of the premises at
$128.33 per day in damages. 
 
Defendant demurs to Plaintiff’s CUD on the grounds that (1) it is not
properly, lawfully verified; (2) the three-day notice fails to include the
proper notice requirements; (3) it fails to state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action; (4) it is vague and uncertain; and (5) fails to
state Plaintiff’s capacity and standing to sue. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent
on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not
the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab,
Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs.
(2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes the truth of the
complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Id.) The only issue a demurrer is
concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of
action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there
is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the
plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.; Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244
Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility that
the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman
v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245). 
 
MEET AND
CONFER
 
A meet and confer declaration is not required pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure § 430.41(d)(2).  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Improper
Verification
 
The Code of Civil Procedure § 1166(a)(1) states
in pertinent part, “[t]he complaint shall…be verified and include the typed or
printed name of the person verifying the complaint.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1166(a)(1).)
 
Defendant contends Plaintiff’s CUD is not
lawfully verified. In opposition, Plaintiff argues that the CUD is properly
verified. 
 
It is true that the form itself is not signed. However,
Plaintiff’s verification is on a separate page and is attached to the CUD after
Exhibit 3. The verification is signed by Plaintiff and dated August 24, 2023.
Plaintiff’s CUD is lawfully verified as required by the Code of Civil
Procedure. Therefore, the demurrer is overruled as to this point. 
 
Improper
Notice
 
The Code of Civil Procedure § 1161(2) states in
pertinent part, “[w]hen the tenant continues in possession, in person or by
subtenant, without the permission of the landlord, or the successor in estate
of the landlord, if applicable, after default in the payment of rent, pursuant
to the lease or agreement under which the property is held, and three days’
notice, excluding Saturdays and Sundays and other judicial holidays, in
writing, requiring its payment, stating the amount that is due, the name, telephone
number, and address of the person to whom the rent payment shall be made…shall
have been served upon the tenant and if there is a subtenant in actual
occupation of the premises, also upon the subtenant.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1162(2).)
 
Defendant contends Plaintiff’s CUD is improper
because the three-day notice fails to include the proper notice requirements.
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that the three-day notice is proper. 
 
Here, Plaintiff’s three-day notice attached to
the CUD has all of the following characteristics: it is in writing, requires
payment of the past-due rent, states the amount due, states the name, telephone
number, and address of Plaintiff to whom the rent payment shall be made, and
was served upon Defendant by posting a copy in a conspicuous place on the
property and by mailing a copy to Defendant after unsuccessful attempts at
personal service. Plaintiff’s three-day notice does comply with the
requirements set forth by the Code of Civil Procedure. Therefore, the demurrer
is overruled as to this point. 
 
Uncertainty
 
The Code of Civil Procedure § 430.10(f) states
in pertinent part, “[t]he party against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has
been filed may object, by demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430.30, to
the pleading on any one or more of the following grounds…[t]he pleading is
uncertain.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(f).)
 
Defendant contends Plaintiff’s CUD is vague and
uncertain. In opposition, Plaintiff argues that there is no confusion or
ambiguity in the summons and complaint and/or the notice. 
 
Here, Plaintiff’s CUD alleges on or about
November 13, 2022, Defendant entered into a one-year written lease agreement
with Plaintiff regarding the premises 5860 Belbert Circle, Calabasas, CA 91302
for monthly rental payment of $3,850.00. Plaintiff further alleges a three-day
notice to pay or quit by August 22, 2023 was served on Defendant and Defendant
failed to comply with the requirements of the notice by that date. Moreover,
Plaintiff alleges at the time the three-day notice to pay or quit was served, the
amount due was $19,250.000. Additionally, Plaintiff alleges the fair rental
value of the premises is $128.33 per day. Lastly, Plaintiff alleges the written
lease agreement provides for attorney’s fees. 
 
Plaintiff’s CUD is unambiguous and certain as it
is currently pled. Therefore, the demurrer is overruled as to this point. 
 
Standing to
Sue 
 
The Code of Civil Procedure § 430.10(b) states
in pertinent part, “[t]he party against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has
been filed may object, by demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430.30, to
the pleading on any one or more of the following grounds…[t]he person who filed
the pleading does not have the legal capacity to sue.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10(b).)
 
Defendant contend Plaintiff CUD must state
Plaintiff’s capacity and standing to sue.
 
Here, Plaintiff’s CUD alleges she has an
interest in the premises as the Landlord and Owner. Further, Plaintiff alleges
that Defendant entered into the written lease agreement with Plaintiff. 
 
Plaintiff’s interest in the premises as the
Landlord and Owner demonstrates capacity and standing to sue. Therefore, the
demurrer is overruled as to this point. 
 
First Cause
of Action – Unlawful Detainer
 
The Code of Civil Procedure § 1161(2) states in
pertinent part, “[w]hen the tenant continues in possession, in person or by
subtenant, without the permission of the landlord, or the successor in estate
of the landlord, if applicable, after default in the payment of rent, pursuant
to the lease or agreement under which the property is held, and three days’
notice, excluding Saturdays and Sundays and other judicial holidays, in
writing, requiring its payment, stating the amount that is due, the name, telephone
number, and address of the person to whom the rent payment shall be made.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1162(2).)
 
Defendant contend Plaintiff’s CUD fails to state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. In opposition, Plaintiff
argues that the CUD alleges that elements of a cause of action for unlawful
detainer. 
 
Here, Plaintiff’s CUD alleges Defendant owes
$19,250.00 in unpaid rent and is still in possession of the premises after
being served the three-day notice to pay or quit. 
 
Plaintiff CUD alleges sufficient to facts to
constitute a cause of action for unlawful detainer. Therefore, the demurrer is
overruled as to the sole cause of action for unlawful detainer. 
 
//
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant Anita Clark’s
Demurrer to Unlawful Detainer Complaint is OVERRULED. 
Defendant has 5 days to answer. Cal Code Civ Proc
