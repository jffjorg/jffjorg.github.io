The judge notes that the plaintiffs' counsel was out of the country and unable to complete the designation, and that the plaintiffs promptly corrected their mistake and re-served the designation. The judge also notes that the defendants declined to accept the late designation and that the plaintiffs have not shown that they will make their experts available for deposition.
