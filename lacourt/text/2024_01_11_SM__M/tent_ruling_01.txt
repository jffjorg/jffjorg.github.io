Analysis
 
Plaintiffs Springlife LLC and David
Javdan move for relief to designate experts. On August 21, 2023, the Court
continued the trial on this matter to February 5, 2023. All fact and expert
discovery deadlines were continued based on that date. On November 14, 2023,
Defendants made a demand for exchange of statutory expert
witness information, specifying
December 18, 2023, as the date of exchange. (Arquell Decl., Ex.
A.) On December 18, 2023, Defendants timely designated experts. (Id.) However, Plaintiffs
did not disclose any expert witnesses by the statutory deadline. On December
20, 2023, Plaintiffs' counsel served their expert designation. 
 
            Plaintiffs’ counsel declaration
provides sufficient evidence showing that their failure to designate was the
result of “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect” and was
promptly corrected. Plaintiffs’ counsel, Michael Green, explains that he was
out of the country in the Philippines from December 13, 2023, to December 18,
2023. (Green Decl., ¶¶4-6.) Although he had taken his laptop with him on his
trip, he could not log in to his document database, preventing him from
completing the designation while he was away. (Id. ¶ 4.) He further explains
that upon his return, he immediately finalized and timely served Plaintiff’s
Expert Designation. (Id. ¶5.) However, due to jetlag from the 15-hour time
difference, counsel inadvertently served the document at the wrong email
address. (Id. ¶ 6.) Plaintiffs promptly corrected the issue on December 20,
2023, when counsel realized his error and immediately re-served the designation
to the correct address. (Id.) Defendants declined to accept the late
designation. Plaintiffs promptly sought relief two days later via ex parte
motion on December 22, 2023.
 
            Defendants object to the late
designation. Defendants argue that it would be unfair to allow Plaintiffs to
present experts and expert testimony when they failed to properly designate experts
pursuant to the Code, and where have not offered their retained and/or
non-retained experts for deposition. Defendants do not show any prejudice to
their defense on the merits. Furthermore, there is no indication that Defendants
have relied on the absence of a list of expert witnesses. However, the Court
concurs that Plaintiffs must make their experts immediately available for
deposition. Indeed, this is a prerequisite to relief. (CCP § 2034.720(d).) Plaintiffs
do not show that they will immediately make their experts available for a
deposition. Plaintiffs must stipulate as such before the motion may be granted.

 
        If
Plaintiffs meet this additional requirement, the motion is GRANTED.
