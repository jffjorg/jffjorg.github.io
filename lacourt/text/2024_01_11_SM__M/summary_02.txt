Judge's Tentative Ruling: Davis v. Bacal et al.

The plaintiff, Ryan Davis, moves to tax the cost memorandum filed by the defendant, Sotheby's International Realty, on August 15, 2023. The memorandum of costs claims a total of $80,837.49 in costs, broken down into various categories. The plaintiff objects to each item, and the court will rule on the objections.

The court finds that the costs for court calls and filing fees are not reasonable and necessary, and therefore will tax them. The court also finds that the costs for court-ordered transcripts are not allowed, as there were no transcripts ordered. The court will determine attorney fees at a later hearing.

The motion to tax costs is granted, and the costs are allowed as follows: $596.00 for filing and motion fees, TBD for attorney fees, and $410.41 for other costs.
