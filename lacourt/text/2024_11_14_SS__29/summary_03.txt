And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to continue the trial date in the case of Maria Del Carman Guevara v. Douglas Emmett, Inc. The motion was filed on October 7, 2024, and the hearing was set for November 14, 2024. The defendants requested that the hearing on their motion for summary judgment be advanced, but the judge denied this request because no summary judgment hearing dates are available within the requested time frame. In the alternative, the defendants requested a trial continuance so that their summary judgment motion can be heard before trial. The judge granted this alternative request, stating that parties have a right to have their timely filed summary judgment motions heard before trial. The trial is now continued to a date in mid-July 2025, and all deadlines are reset based on the new trial date.
