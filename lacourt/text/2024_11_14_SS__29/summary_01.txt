The parties entered into a settlement agreement, which was filed and signed by the court on September 21, 2022. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the agreement. Although the defendant has made some payments, they still owe $8,147.76, including a filing fee. The court finds that the parties entered into a valid agreement, the court retains jurisdiction, and there is good cause to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment against the defendant.
