Emmett, Inc.
21STCV37122
Defendants’ Motion to Advance Hearing Date or Continue Trial 
Tentative
The motion to continue trial is granted.
Background
On
October 7, 2021, Maria Del Carman Guevara (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint
against Douglas Emmett, Inc., and Does 1 through 100, asserting causes of
action for premises liability and general negligence arising out of an incident
on October 11, 2019, in which Plaintiff alleges that she walked “near or around”
a “full height wall of clear transparent glass” installed in an office building
in Century City.  
 
On
filing, the case was assigned a trial date of April 6, 2023.
 
On
March 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) asserting the
same causes of action against the same defendants.
 
At
the Final Status Conference on March 23, 2023, the Court vacated the trial date
and set a Trial Setting Conference for October 9, 2023.
 
On
May 18, 2023, Plaintiff amended the complaint to name Dougles Emmett 1997, LLC as
Doe 1 and Douglas Emmett Management, LLC as Does 1 and 2.
 
On
May 26, 2023, Dougles Emmett 1997, LLC and Douglas Emmett Management, LLC (collectively
“Defendants”) filed their answer to the FAC.
 
On
May 30, 2023, the Court, at the request of Plaintiff, dismissed all causes of
action against Douglas Emmett, Inc.
 
On
October 9, 2023, the Court set trial for January 23, 2025.
 
On October 1, 2024, Defendants filed a motion for summary
judgment.  The hearing is set for June
12, 2025.
 
On October 7,
2024, Defendants filed this motion to advance the hearing date for the motion
for summary judgment, or in the alternative, to continue trial. Plaintiff filed
an opposition on October 22. 
The hearing on
this motion was initially set for November 4 and was continued, on the Court’s
own motion, to November 14.
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 128,
subdivision (a)(8), provides that the court has the power to amend and control
its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice. “The
power to determine when a continuance should be granted is within the
discretion of the trial court.” (Color-Vue, Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44
Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide latitude in the matter of
calendar control including the granting or denying of continuances.” (Park
Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.)  
“To ensure the prompt disposition of civil
cases, the dates assigned for trial are firm. 
All parties and their counsel must regard the date set for trial as
certain.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(a).)
“Although continuances of trials are
disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own
merits.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(c).)  “The court may grant a
continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the
continuance.”  (Ibid.)  Circumstances that may support a finding of
good cause include:  
“(1) The
unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness because of death, illness,
or other excusable circumstances;  
(2) The
unavailability of a party because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(3) The
unavailability of trial counsel because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(4) The
substitution of trial counsel, but only where there is an affirmative showing
that the substitution is required in the interests of justice;  
(5) The addition
of a new party if: (A) The new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to
conduct discovery and prepare for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had
a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard
to the new party's involvement in the case; 

(6) A party's
excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material
evidence despite diligent efforts; or  
(7) A
significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case as a result of
which the case is not ready for trial.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c).)  
“In ruling on a motion or application for
continuance, the court must consider all the facts and circumstances that are
relevant to the determination.”  (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).)  California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d) sets forth a non-exhaustive list of factors that
the court may consider:  
“(1) The
proximity of the trial date;  
(2) Whether
there was any previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to
any party;  
(3) The length
of the continuance requested;  
(4) The
availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the
motion or application for a continuance; 

(5) The
prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;

(6) If the case
is entitled to a preferential trial setting, the reasons for that status and
whether the need for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; 
(7) The court's
calendar and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending trials; 
(8) Whether
trial counsel is engaged in another trial; 

(9) Whether all
parties have stipulated to a continuance; 

(10) Whether the
interests of justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the
matter, or by imposing conditions on the continuance; and  
(11) Any other
fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or
application.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).) 
“A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment
motion filed within the time limits of section 437c.” (Sentry Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529; accord Cole v. Superior
Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.)
Discussion
Defendants first request that the hearing on
their motion for summary judgment be advanced so it can be heard before the
January 23, 2025 trial date.  That request
is denied.  The Court does not have any summary
judgment hearing dates available within the time frame requested.
In the alternative, Defendants request a trial continuance so that their
summary judgment motion may be heard before trial.  Parties have a right to have their timely
filed summary judgment motions heard before trial.  (Cole, supra, 87
Cal.App.5th at p. 88; Sentry Ins. Co., supra, 207 Cal.App.3d at p. 529.)  Accordingly, the alternative request to
continue the trial date is granted.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion to
continue trial. 
The Court ORDERS that the trial is CONTINUED
to a date in mid July 2025.  The Final
Status Conference and all deadlines are reset based on the new trial date.
Moving Party is ORDERED to give notice.
