20STCV40068
Motion to Set Aside Dismissal and Enter Judgment
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On October
19, 2020, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Ana Janet Guardado (“Defendant”) and Does I through V for
damages in the amount of $34,781.76 arising out of an automobile accident between
Plaintiff’s insured and Defendant on January 30, 2020.
 
On March 2, 2021, Defendant filed an answer.
 
The
parties entered into a settlement agreement. 
The Court dismissed the case on September 21, 2022 and retained
jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. 
 
On September 18,
2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment
on Defendant in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. No
opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6
provides that “[i]f parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the
court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may
enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.)  In ruling on a motion to enter judgment, the
court acts as a trier of fact.  The court
must determine whether the parties entered into a valid and binding
settlement.  (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby,
Inc. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533.)
 “If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a).)  
Discussion
On April 7,
2022, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a written stipulation for the entry
of judgment for $34,781.76, which would be discharged upon the payment of $32,000.
(Benson Decl., ¶ 4; see also Exh. A.) An initial payment of $25,000 was to be
made by Allstate Insurance, followed by monthly payments of $75 until the
remaining $7,000.00 was paid. (Exh. 1, ¶ 2.)
 
On September
21, 2022, the stipulation was filed and signed by the Court; the Court reserved
jurisdiction to enforce the stipulation. 
 
Defendant’s
insurance carrier made a onetime $25,000 payment, and Defendant paid $1,709 in
the monthly payments. (Benson Decl., ¶ 5.) Defendant still owes $8,147.76 (which
includes filing fee). (Id., ¶ 9.) 
 
The Court finds Plaintiff has established that
there was a valid agreement between the parties, that the Court retains
jurisdiction, and that there is good cause to set aside the dismissal and enter
judgment against Defendant Ana Janet Guardado pursuant to the written
settlement agreement of the parties.
Therefore, the Court GRANTS the motion to set
aside the dismissal and enter judgment against Defendant Ana Janet Guardado.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS the motion to set aside the
dismissal. Judgment is entered against Ana Janet Guardado for $8,147.76. 
Moving Party is
ORDERED to give notice.
