And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ordered that the hearing on Coolsys' motion to compel Albertsons to provide further responses to discovery be continued for approximately 45 days. This decision is based on the Eighth Amended Standing Order For Procedures In The Personal Injury Hub Courts, which requires that parties participate in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) before a hearing on a motion to compel. Since the parties have not yet participated in an IDC, the judge has ordered that the hearing be continued to allow for this conference to take place. The hearing will now be held on a future date in Department 29 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
