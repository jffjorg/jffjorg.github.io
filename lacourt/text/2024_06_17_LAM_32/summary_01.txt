Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a motion for terminating sanctions filed by Defendant CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES against Plaintiffs EVELEN MARTINEZ, et al. The Plaintiffs filed a medical malpractice action on behalf of their deceased son, alleging that the Defendant's negligence caused his death. The Defendant moved to exclude Plaintiffs' expert witnesses from testifying at trial due to their failure to produce them for deposition. The Court granted the motion and ordered the Plaintiffs to produce their experts for deposition within 20 days. The Plaintiffs failed to comply with the order and have not produced their experts for deposition. The Judge finds that the Plaintiffs' failure to comply with the Court's order is willful and that terminating sanctions are warranted. Therefore, the Defendant's motion for terminating sanctions is granted.
