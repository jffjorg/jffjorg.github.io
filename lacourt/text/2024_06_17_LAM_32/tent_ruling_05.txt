  Case No.:  24STCV11648
  Hearing Date:  June 17, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s petition for relief from
  government code section 945.4 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On May 8, 2024, Plaintiff Fady
Ashraf Youssef filed the instant petition for relief from Government Code
section 945.4. Plaintiff seeks to sue the City of Los Angeles for injuries he
sustained while exiting a parking structure owned by the City. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Under the Tort Claims Act, certain claims
must be presented to a public entity before a plaintiff may file a civil action
for damages. (Gov. Code, § 945.4.) A plaintiff must present his claim no later
than six months after the cause of action accrues. (Id., § 911.2, subd.
(a).) If a claim is rejected as untimely, a plaintiff may file with the
government entity an application for leave to file a late claim. (Id., §
911.4.) If this application is rejected, a plaintiff has six months to petition
the court for relief from the requirements of Section 945.4. (Id., §
946.6.) This six-month deadline begins running upon the actual denial of the
application, not when notice of the denial is given. (Rason v. Santa Barbara
City Housing Authority (1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 817, 824.)
A petition under Section 946.6 must show
each of the following: (1) that application was made to the board under Section
911.4 and was denied or deemed denied; (2) the reason for failure to present
the claim within the time limit specified in Section 911.2; and (3) the
information required by Section 910. (Gov. Code, § 946.6, subd. (b).) The court
shall grant the requested relief if it finds that “[t]he failure to present the
claim was through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect unless
the public entity establishes that it would be prejudiced in the defense of the
claim if the court relieves the petitioner from the requirements of Section
945.4.” (Id., subd. (c)(1).)  
DISCUSSION
            The petition is unaccompanied by a
proof of service demonstrating that Defendant was properly served. Therefore,
the petition is denied for lack of proper service. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s petition for relief is
DENIED.
