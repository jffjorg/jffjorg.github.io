And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment. The defendant, Bart & Judy's Bakery, Inc., filed the motion on May 9, 2024, citing the CEO's medical condition as the reason for the delay. However, the judge found that the defendant had been actively participating in the litigation and had been repeatedly reminded to obtain counsel. The judge also noted that the defendant had been given notice of the need to obtain counsel in November 2023 and that the CEO had an attorney in mind by January 10, 2024. The judge ruled that the defendant had not provided a sufficient excuse for the delay and had not demonstrated diligence in seeking relief. The judge also considered the policy in favor of the efficient resolution of disputes and concluded that setting aside the default judgment would not be in the best interest of the parties.
