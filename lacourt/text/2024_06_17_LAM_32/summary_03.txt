Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to strike certain allegations from the First Amended Complaint in a product liability action. The plaintiff, Fernando Barajas-Salomon, filed the complaint against various defendants, including Mohawk Industries, Inc. The defendant filed a motion to strike the phrase "and other silica-containing stone products to be identified during the course of discovery" and paragraphs 670 and 671, which describe criminal liability imposed against the defendant in the 1990s. The court granted the motion to strike the phrase as it allows the plaintiff to base liability on any number of unidentified products, contrary to the heightened standard for pleading toxic exposure. The court also granted the motion to strike paragraphs 670 and 671 as they are irrelevant to the present dispute. The court notes that the defendant has complied with the meet and confer requirement.
