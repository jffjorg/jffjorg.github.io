And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Lincoln Alline, filed a motion for trial preference on the grounds that he is 91 years old and suffers from multiple debilitating conditions, including Parkinson's disease. However, the court finds that the service of pleadings and documents was improper, as it was done by mail before any defendant had appeared. Therefore, the court denies the plaintiff's motion for trial preference.
