LINCOLN ALLINE,
                        Plaintiff,
            v.
 
WINDSOR GARDENS CONVALESCENT HOSPITAL,
  INC., et al., 
                        
                       Defendants. 


 
  Case No.:  24STCV09555
  Hearing Date:  June 17, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion for trial preference 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On April 16, 2024, Plaintiff Lincoln
Alline, through attorney-in-fact Kathryn Higgins, filed this action against
Defendants Windsor Gardens Convalescent Hospital, Inc., SNF Management, Inc.,
Antelope Holdings II, LLC, and Antelope Holdings III, LLC. The complaint
asserts causes of action for (1) negligence, (2) elder abuse, and (3) violation
of the Patient Bill of Rights. 
            On May 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant motion for trial preference on the grounds that he is 91 years old and
suffers from multiple debilitating conditions, including Parkinson’s disease. 
LEGAL STANDARD
“A party to a civil action who is over 70
years of age may petition the court for a preference, which the court shall
grant if the court makes both of the following findings: (1) The party has a
substantial interest in the action as a whole. (2) The health of the party is
such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing the party’s interest
in the litigation.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 36(a).) “Upon the granting of such a
motion for preference, the court shall set the matter for trial not more than
120 days from that date.” (Id., § 36(f).) 
DISCUSSION
            Initial service of pleadings and
documents must be effectuated by one of the methods prescribed in Code of Civil
Procedure section 415.10 et seq. Service by mail is permitted only for
subsequent papers after a party has appeared. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1013.)
The instant motion was served by mail before the appearance of any defendant.
Therefore, service was improper. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion for trial
preference is DENIED.
