  order RE:
defendant children’s hospital of los
  angeles’ motion for terminating sanctions 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On May 27, 2022, Plaintiffs filed
this medical malpractice action on behalf of their deceased son, who died after
several MRI scans. Plaintiffs allege that Decedent was improperly exposed to
the chemical gadolinium throughout the course of the MRIs, resulting in severe
burns, health complications, and eventually death. Plaintiffs allege that
Decedent had a history of hypersensitivity to gadolinium and that Defendants
were put on notice of Decedent’s condition and should have been aware of the
risks of gadolinium exposure in children. The complaint alleges causes of
action for (1) medical malpractice, (2) medical malpractice-lack of informed
consent, (3) medical battery, and (4) a survival action. 
            On April 17, 2024, Defendant
Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles (CHLA) filed a motion to deem matters
admitted in its Requests for Admission, Set Three. Plaintiffs did not file an
opposition. At the initial hearing on May 20, 2024, the Court informed the
parties that the motion would be granted if Plaintiffs did not file an
opposition or respond to the RFAs. Plaintiffs did not file an opposition or
respond to the RFAs, and the motion was granted on June 3, 2024.
            On April 2, 2024, CHLA filed a
motion to exclude Plaintiffs’ expert witnesses from testifying at trial based
on Plaintiffs’ failure to present the experts for deposition. In its order on
May 1, 2024, the Court granted the motion in part, ordering Plaintiffs to
produce their experts for deposition within 20 days but declining to impose the
requested evidentiary sanction. To date, Plaintiffs have not produced their
experts for deposition. 
            On May 17, 2024, CHLA filed the
instant motion for terminating sanctions based on Plaintiffs’ failure to comply
with the Court’s May 1, 2024 order. Plaintiffs have not filed an opposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
The Court may impose monetary or
nonmonetary sanctions against a party engaging in misuse of the discovery
process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) Misuse of the discovery process is
defined as, among other things, failing to respond to an authorized method of
discovery, making an evasive response to discovery, or disobeying a court order
for discovery. (Id., § 2023.010.) If a lesser sanction fails to curb
misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing misuses of the discovery
process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until the sanction is reached
that will curb the abuse. (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174
Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “The penalty should be appropriate to the dereliction,
and should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the
party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Wilson v. Jefferson (1985) 163
Cal.App.3d 952, 959.) Generally, two facts are prerequisite to the imposition
of nonmonetary sanctions: (1) there must be a failure to comply with a court
order; and (2) the failure must be willful. (Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp.
(2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.) 
DISCUSSION
On May 1, 2024, CHLA served a second
notice for the depositions of Plaintiffs’ experts, set for May 17, 2024. (Kjar
Decl. ¶ 10.) Plaintiffs failed to produce the experts on May 17, 2024, nor did
Plaintiffs request an alternative date. (Id., ¶¶ 11-12.) Therefore,
Plaintiffs have failed to comply with the Court’s order to produce their
experts for deposition. No justification is provided for this failure. Given
the history of discovery failures and court orders, it is apparent that lesser
sanctions will not suffice. Under these circumstances, terminating sanctions
are warranted. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant CHLA’s motion for
terminating sanctions is GRANTED.
