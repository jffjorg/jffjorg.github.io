  order RE:
defendant bart & Judy’s bakery,
  inc.’s motion to set aside default 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On June 29, 2022, Plaintiff A&N
Industrial Properties, LLC filed a complaint against Defendants Bart &
Judy’s Bakery, Inc. (B&J) and Bart Greenhut (Greenhut). The complaint
alleges the following causes of action: (1) breach of lease; (2) common counts;
and (3) breach of written guaranty.    
            At an Order to Show Cause (OSC) on
January 18, 2024, the Court struck B&J’s answer because B&J was a
corporation not represented by counsel. There was no appearance for or by
B&J at the hearing. On January 30, 2024, Greenhut was dismissed without
prejudice pursuant to Plaintiff’s request. The Court entered default judgment
against B&J on April 9, 2024. 
            On May 9, 2024, B&J filed the
instant motion to set aside the default. Plaintiff filed its opposition on June
3, 2024. B&J filed its reply on June 10, 2024.     
LEGAL STANDARD
“The court may, upon any terms as may be
just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or
her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
473(b).) “The party seeking relief . . . bears the burden of proof in
establishing a right to relief.” (Hopkins & Carley v. Gens (2011)
200 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1410.) “The burden is a double one: the moving party must
show a satisfactory excuse for his default, and he must show diligence in
making the motion after discovery of the default.” (Id., internal
citations omitted.) 
DISCUSSION
            B&J moves for relief on the
grounds that Greenhut, its CEO and authorized representative, could not attend
the OSC or promptly obtain counsel due to his medical condition. (Greenhut
Decl. ¶¶ 6, 8.) Plaintiff counters that Greenhut has been an active participant
in the action, including after relieving his counsel. (Patterson Decl. ¶¶ 6, 8,
13-15.) Greenhut has directly communicated with Plaintiff’s counsel on multiple
occasions and has been repeatedly reminded of the need to obtain counsel for
B&J. (Ibid.) 
            B&J was put on notice of the
requirement to obtain counsel through the Court’s November 29, 2023 order
relieving its then-counsel. In fact, Greenhut had an attorney in mind by
January 10, 2024. (Patterson Decl. ¶ 15.) At the latest, B&J was placed on
notice by January 18, 2024, when its answer was stricken for failure to obtain
counsel. Given that Greenhut has actively participated in the litigation, was
able to contact a new attorney by January 10, 2024, and was on repeated notice
of the need to retain counsel, B&J has not provided a sufficient excuse for
waiting until April 9, 2024 to substitute new counsel and then waiting one more
month after that to file this motion. This demonstrates neither a satisfactory
excuse for the default nor diligence in seeking relief. 
            The trial had already been continued
once to allow time for B&J to obtain counsel. If the default is set aside,
Plaintiff will have to expend resources to withdraw the recorded judgment and
unwind other post-judgment procedures that have taken place. In this particular
case, the policy in favor of the efficient resolution of disputes outweighs the
policy in favor of resolution on the merits. (See McClain v. Kissler
(2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 399, 405.)   
CONCLUSION
            Defendant B&J’s motion to set
aside default is DENIED.
