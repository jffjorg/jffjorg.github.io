And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied Cross-Complainant Caster Modelo's motion for sanctions in the amount of $13,640.49 against Cross-Defendant Vivoli Saccuzo. The motion was brought under Code of Civil Procedure sections 128.5 and 128.7, which allow the court to impose sanctions on a party or attorney who files papers in court frivolously or for an improper purpose. The Court found that Cross-Defendant Vivoli Saccuzo's anti-SLAPP motion was not frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay, and that the conduct was objectively reasonable. The Court also found that there was no evidence that the motion was brought for an improper purpose, and that each party is entitled to challenge the claims brought against it in order to preserve their appellate rights.
