Lancaster Eagle, LLC sued Defendants Payam Bahari, Freydoon “Fred” Bahari
Moghadam, Haim Bahari, Tal Bahari, 114 Grand Cypress, LLC, Cavalini, Inc., and
Caster Modelo, LLC, on December 16, 2022, and filed their operative second
amended complaint (“SAC”) on February 9, 2024. The SAC asserts causes of action
for breach of a joint venture agreement, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and
abetting the same, and fraudulent conveyances. Plaintiffs allege they entered a
joint real estate investment venture with Defendants, then Defendants exploited
the venture’s investment leads and directly invested for their own gain in
properties discovered by Plaintiffs for the venture. 
 
Defendant
Caster Modelo, LLC (“Caster Modelo”) cross-complained against Plaintiffs and
against Vivoli Saccuzo, LLP on April 19, 2024, and filed its operative first
amended cross-complaint (“FAXC”) on May 3, 2024. The FAXC asserts causes of
action for an accounting, breach of contract, conversion, declaratory relief,
and receipt of stolen property. Modelo alleges that it and
Plaintiff/Cross-defendant Lancaster Eagle entered a written tenancy-in-common
agreement (“TIC”) related to a property located in Lancaster (“Property”). The
parties expressly disclaimed any joint venture arrangement in the TIC. When the
parties sought to sell the Property, the cross-complaint avers, Lancaster Eagle
first threatened to scuttle the deal unless it received more than 50%
compensation from the sale, then it stole collectively-owned funds from the
TIC. 
 
On
June 5, 2024, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendants Morad Ben
Neman and Lancaster Eagle, LLC specially moved to strike Caster Modelo’s second
cause of action for breach of contract, third cause of action for conversion,
and fifth cause of action for receipt of stolen property, under Code of Civil
Procedure section 425.16, California’s “anti-SLAPP” law. On July 30, 2024,
the Court denied this special motion to strike.
 
            Then, on August 12, 2024, Cross-Defendant
Vivoli Saccuzzo, LLP (Vivoli Saccuzzo) specially moved to strike Cross-Complainant
Caster Modelo’s third cause of action for conversion and fifth cause of action
for violation of Penal Code section 496, under Code of Civil Procedure section
425.16. Cross-Complainant Caster Modelo opposed the anti-SLAPP motion. The
Court also denied this special motion to strike.
 
            Now, Cross-Complainant Caster Modelo
moves for sanctions in the amount of $13,640.49 because of Vivoli Saccuzo’s
anti-SLAPP motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
sections 128.5 and 128.7.[1] Cross-Defendant Vivoli Saccuzzo
opposes the motion. 
 
            The motion for sanctions pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure Sections 128.5 and 128.7 is denied.
 
Discussion
 
            Cross-Complaint moves for sanctions pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 128.5 and 128.7 on the grounds that Cross-Defendant Vivoli
Saccuzzo’s anti-SLAPP
motion was “frivolous” and/or “solely intended to cause unnecessary delay,” was
“presented for an improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary
delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation” and “[c]ontains legal
contentions that are not warranted by existing law.”
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
128.7 allows a court to impose sanctions against parties and attorneys who file
papers in court frivolously or for an improper purpose. (Civ. Code Proc., §
128.7, subd. (b).) However, there are strict procedural steps that must be met
before a court imposes section 128.7 sanctions. Code of Civil Procedure section
128.5 contains nearly identical procedural requirements when seeking sanctions.
(Code Civ. Pro., § 128.5, subd. (f).)
 
As
a preliminary matter, “a party seeking
sanctions under sections 128.5 and 128.7 must follow a two-step procedure.” (Transcon
Financial, Inc. v. Reid & Hellyer, APC (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 547, 550
[citing Martorana v. Marlin & Saltzman (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 685,
698].) First, the “ ‘moving party must serve on the offending party a motion
for sanctions.’ ” (Ibid.) Service of the sanctions motion triggers the
21-day safe harbor period during which the moving party may not file the
motion. (Ibid.) The offending party may avoid sanctions by withdrawing
the challenged pleading during the 21-day period. (Ibid.) Second, if the
offending party does not withdraw the challenged pleading during that period,
then the moving party may file the sanctions motion. (Ibid.)
 
Here, on September 20, 2024, Cross-Complainant
Caster Modelo e-mailed to Cross-Defendant a copy of this Motion. (Zohar Decl., ¶
9.) Cross-Defendant Vivoli Saccuzzo did not withdraw the motion within the
time required by Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5, subdivision (f)(1)(D),
and 128.7, subdivision (c)(1). As a result, the “safe harbor” period for
withdrawing the motion had expired. Accordingly, Cross-Complainant Caster
Modelo properly filed and served this motion for sanctions on October 14, 2024.

 
Based on the foregoing, the motion
for sanctions complies with the procedural requirements of both Code of Civil Procedure sections 128.5 and 128.7. Moreover, in the
absence of any opposition on this ground, Cross-Defendant has forfeited
any challenge to the notice provided in the sanctions motion. (In re
Marriage of Falcone & Fyke (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 814, 826; Arambula v. Union Carbide Corp. (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 333, 342-343.)

            The Court
now turns to the substantive merits of the motion.
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5, the
“trial court may order a party, the party's attorney, or both, to pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by another party as a
result of actions or tactics, made in bad faith, that are frivolous or solely
intended to cause unnecessary delay.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.5, subd. (a).) An
action is “frivolous” if it is “totally and completely without merit or for the
sole purpose of harassing an opposing party,” judged by an objective standard.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 128.5, subd. (b)(2); Chitsazzadeh v. Kramer & Kaslow
(2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 676, 683–684.) “ ‘Frivolous in this context means
that any reasonable attorney would agree the motion was totally devoid of merit.’
” (Alfaro v. Waterhouse Management Corp. (2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 26, 36–37.)
 
The action must also be taken in bad faith, judged by
a subjective standard. (In re Marriage of Sahafzadeh-Taeb & Taeb
(2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 124, 134–135.)
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7,
“there are basically three types of submitted papers that warrant sanctions:
factually frivolous (not well grounded in fact); legally frivolous (not
warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension,
modification, or reversal of existing law); and papers interposed for an
improper purpose. [Citations.]” (Guillemin v. Stein (2002) 104
Cal.App.4th 156, 167.) 
 
However – unlike
sanctions under section 128.5 that requires a finding of subjective bad faith –
“section 128.7 imposes a lower threshold for sanctions ... that the conduct
[merely] be ‘objectively unreasonable.’ ” (Guillemin v. Stein (2002) 104
Cal.App.4th 156, 167.) That is, courts apply “an objective standard in making
its inquiry concerning the attorney's or party’s allegedly sanctionable
behavior in connection with a motion for sanctions brought under section 128.7.
[Citations.]” (Optimal Markets, Inc. v. Salant (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th
912, 921.)
 
As the Court’s analysis on the ruling on
Cross-Defendant Vivoli
Saccuzzo’s anti-SLAPP showed, litigation funding is generally
considered protected activity under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16.
Only after reviewing the legal elements of the cross-claims and the specific
allegations themselves was the Court able to determine that the wrong
complained of was not litigation funding. Here, the analysis of Cross-Defendant
Vivoli Saccuzzo’s anti-SLAPP motion was legally complex and required a
nuanced understanding how the law defines protected activity. Nothing about Cross-Defendant
Vivoli Saccuzzo’s anti-SLAPP motion
could be described as “totally devoid of merit.” 
 
Further, there is no evidence that the motion was
brought for an improper purpose. Cross-Complainant notes that the Court had recently
denied an anti-SLAPP motion brought by Cross-Defendant Neman Parties; Cross-Complainant
suggests that this earlier denied motion was “nearly identical” to Cross-Defendant Vivoli Saccuzzo’s anti-SLAPP motion
such that Cross-Defendant Vivoli Saccuzzo knew that their
anti-SLAPP motion would be denied and would only cause unnecessary delay to the
litigation. 
 
However, each party is entitled to challenge the
claims brought against it in order to preserve their appellate rights. Thus, on
this basis alone, the Court declines to find any improper motive by
Cross-Defendant Vivoli
Saccuzzo in filing its anti-SLAPP
motion. Further, even a cursory review of the Court’s two anti-SLAPP rulings
shows a very different legal analysis under Code of Civil Procedure section
425.16. This difference reflects the different legal issues under consideration
for the differently situated parties. Thus, contrary to
Cross-Complainant’s argument, the Court’s ruling on the Cross-Defendant Vivoli
Saccuzzo’s anti-SLAPP motion – although
involving some similar issues – was not a forgone conclusion. 
 
Conclusion
 
The motion for sanctions
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Sections 128.5 and 128.7 is denied.
