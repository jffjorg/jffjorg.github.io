And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

This is an action for violations of the Labor Code, wrongful termination, and unfair competition. The plaintiff alleges that while working as a server, the defendants failed to pay him an hourly wage, only paid him a stipend, and failed to permit statutory breaks. When the plaintiff complained, the defendants retaliated by constructively terminating the plaintiff's employment.

The court grants the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment. The court awards damages in the amount of $162,601.50, consisting of $135,232 in unpaid wages, $12,159.50 in unpaid meal breaks, and $15,210 in penalties. The court also awards interest in the amount of $14,274.79 and attorney's fees in the amount of $3,506.02. The court awards costs in the amount of $726.91.

The court concludes that the defendants failed to pay the plaintiff minimum wage, failed to provide meal and rest breaks, and failed to provide personnel and payroll records. The court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to damages for these violations and awards the plaintiff the requested relief.
