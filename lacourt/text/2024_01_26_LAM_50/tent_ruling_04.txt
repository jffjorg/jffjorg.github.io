  ORDER RE:
 
DEFENDANT EVAN
  RACHEL WOOD’S MOTION FOR AWARD OF MANDATORY ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS



 
Background
On
March 2, 2022, Plaintiff Brian Warner p/k/a Marilyn Manson (“Plaintiff”) filed
this action against Defendants Evan Rachel Wood (“Wood”) and Ashley Gore a/k/a
Illma Gore (“Gore”) (jointly, “Defendants”). The Complaint asserts causes of
action for (1) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (2) defamation per
se, (3) violation of the Comprehensive Computer Data and Access Fraud Act (Penal Code Section 502(c), (e)(1)), and (4)
Impersonation over the Internet (Penal Code Section
528.5(a), (e)).  
Wood moved
to strike portions of Plaintiff’s Complaint pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, and on May
9, 2023, the Court issued an order granting the motion in part. The Court’s May
9, 2023 Order provides, inter alia, that “Defendants are the prevailing
parties on their respective motions, so they may file noticed motions pursuant
to statutory requirements.” (May 9, 2023 Order at p. 33:14-16.)[1]
Wood now
moves for an order compelling Plaintiff “to reimburse [Wood] for
$346,470 in attorneys’ fees and $9,193.67 in costs incurred in connection with
[Wood’s] successful Special Motion to Strike, for $22,050 in attorneys’ fees
incurred in connection with preparing this Motion and the supporting evidence,
and for $10,100 in attorneys’ fees that [Wood] anticipates will be incurred in
connection with the Reply brief and hearing on this Motion.” Plaintiff opposes. 
Discussion
The anti-SLAPP statute
provides that “a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike
shall be entitled to recover that defendant’s attorney’s fees and costs” (Code Civ. Proc.,     § 425.16, subd. (c)(1).) “[A]ny SLAPP defendant who brings a successful motion to strike is
entitled to mandatory attorney fees.” (Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1131.) An award of fees may also include
“the fees incurred in enforcing the right to mandatory fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16.” (Id. at
p. 1141.) “It is well established that the amount of an attorney fee
award under the anti-SLAPP statute is computed by the trial court in accordance
with the familiar lodestar method.”
(569 East County Boulevard LLC v.
Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016)
6 Cal.App.5th 426, 432 [internal quotations and brackets omitted].) Under the lodestar method, the court tabulates the attorney fee
lodestar by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended by the
reasonable hourly rate prevailing in the community for similar work.” (Ibid.)
With regard to the
number of hours reasonably expended, “the verified time statements of the
attorneys, as officers of the court, are entitled to credence in the absence of
a clear indication the records are erroneous.” (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State
University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th
359, 396.) In determining the reasonable hourly
rate, the “burden is on the successful party to prove the appropriate market
rate to be used in calculating the lodestar.” (MBNA
America Bank, N.A. v. Gorman (2006)
147 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1, 13.) The trial court may reduce the award
where the fee request appears unreasonably inflated, such as where the
attorneys’ efforts are unorganized or duplicative. (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635, fn. 21.)
In his supporting
declaration, Wood’s counsel states that Wood “seeks an award of $346,470
in attorney’s fees and $9,193.67 in costs incurred in connection with her successful
Special Motion to Strike…” (Kump Decl., ¶ 5.) Wood seeks an additional $22,050.00
in connection with preparing the instant motion. (Kump Decl., ¶¶ 21-22.) Wood
also anticipates incurring $10,100.00 in attorneys’ fees in connection with the
reply brief and hearing on the instant motion. (Kump Decl., ¶¶ 23-24.) 
Wood’s counsel states that Wood was billed by Kinsella Holley Iser
Kump Steinsapir LLP (“KHIKS”) on an hourly basis, and that “[i]n 2022, the
standard hourly rates for [Michael J. Kump] (Partner), Shawn Holley (Partner),
Katherine Kleindienst (Partner), Allen Secretov (Senior Associate), and Linda
Mason (Paralegal) were $850 per hour, $800 per hour, $625 per hour, $525 per
hour, and $275 per hour, respectively.” (Kump Decl., ¶ 9.) Mr. Kump, Wood’s
counsel, further states in his supporting declaration that “Ms. Kleindienst,
Ms. Mason, and I also performed work on this matter in 2023, when my standard
hourly rate had increased to $900 per hour, Ms. Kleindienst’s rate had
increased to $650 per hour, and Ms. Mason’s hourly rate had increased to $295
per hour.” (Kump Decl., ¶ 9.)
            Mr. Kump asserts that “[t]he
standard hourly rates charged by myself and my colleagues are extremely
reasonable given our education, experience (in the law and in representing
clients in high-stakes cases in the entertainment industry), and the rates charged
by other lawyers in the market.” (Kump Decl., ¶ 9.) Wood’s counsel also sets
forth each attorney’s background and experience. (Kump Decl., ¶¶ 14-17.) The
Court notes that Plaintiff does not appear to dispute Wood’s counsels’
requested hourly rates. 
            Next, Wood asserts that the time
spent prosecuting Wood’s motion was reasonable. Wood’s counsel states that
Wood’s anti-SLAPP motion was litigated for more than a year. (Kump Decl., ¶ 7.)
Wood states that she seeks fees for work performed in connection with: (1)
researching, drafting, and revising Wood’s anti-SLAPP motion, request for
judicial notice, and other supporting papers, including declarations and
evidence; (2) responding to Plaintiff’s two separate ex parte
applications to continue the anti-SLAPP hearing, drafting Wood’s opposition,
and attending the hearings on the ex parte applications; (3)
researching, drafting, and revising Wood’s opposition to Plaintiff’s motion for
anti-SLAPP discovery and supporting papers, including declarations and
evidence; (4) preparing for and attending the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion for
anti-SLAPP discovery; (5) attending a deposition taken by Plaintiff to oppose
Defendants’ anti-SLAPP motions; (6) researching, drafting, and revising Wood’s
Reply brief in support of the anti-SLAPP motion, drafting evidentiary
objections to the 9 declarations and 49 exhibits submitted by Plaintiff, and
responding to Plaintiff’s evidentiary objections; (7) meeting and conferring
with Plaintiff and Gore to consolidate and reduce the evidentiary objections
and drafting a 54-page Joint Statement regarding the remaining evidentiary
objections; (8) analyzing motions to seal filed by Plaintiff and Gore and
preparing for and attending hearings on December 1, 2022 and February 7, 2023
regarding the anti-SLAPP motion, evidentiary objections, and motions to seal;
(9) researching, drafting, and revising an opposition to Plaintiff’s ex
parte application to supplement the record on the anti-SLAPP motion,
drafting and revising supporting declarations, and attending the hearing on
Plaintiff’s ex parte application; and (10) preparing for and appearing
at the hearing on the anti-SLAPP motion. (Kump Decl., ¶ 12.) 
            Wood asserts that “[g]iven the
circumstances—including the number of hearing dates and the volume of papers
filed in connection with the anti-SLAPP motions over the span of more than a
year—having four attorneys collectively spend approximately 500 hours working
on anti-SLAPP motion-related tasks is reasonable.” (Mot. at p. 13:21-24,
emphasis omitted.) The “Hours Expended” that are listed in paragraph 12 of
Wood’s counsel’s declaration appear to add up to over 500 hours. (Kump Decl., ¶
12.)
            In the opposition, Plaintiff asserts
that “Wood seeks reimbursement for excessive, duplicative, inefficient, and
block-billed work that is vaguely described and obscured by copious
redactions.” (Opp’n at p. 4:21-22.) 
            In his supporting declaration,
Wood’s counsel states that “[t]rue and correct copies of the invoices
reflecting the amounts billed for our services are attached hereto as Exhibit
D.” (Kump Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. D.) Wood’s counsel states that “[t]he invoices
attached as Exhibit D have been redacted where necessary so as not to reveal
the specific subject matter of attorney-client privileged communications and
the privileged, strategy decisions, mental impressions, or opinions of counsel.
All entries related to work that did not concern the anti-SLAPP motion are
redacted as Ms. Wood is not seeking to recover fees unrelated to the anti-SLAPP
motion.” (Kump Decl., ¶ 11.) In the opposition, Plaintiff asserts that
“thirteen entries, reflecting 14.2 hours…contain partial redactions that make
it impossible to determine what portion of the total billed time, if any,
should be allocated to the anti-SLAPP motion, and whether that amount is
reasonable.” (Opp’n at pp. 4:26-5:1, citing Trugman Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A.) 
            Plaintiff notes that for instance, a
billing entry from April 4, 2022 for 2.5 hours states “[r]esearch and
strategize regarding anti-SLAPP motion...” (Kump Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. D.) The
remainder of the billing entry is redacted. (Ibid.)
 Plaintiff asserts that there is “no way
to determine how much of the 2.5 hours was for the anti-SLAPP task versus the
redacted task.” (Opp’n at p. 5:9-10.)
            In
the reply, Wood counters that “Plaintiff complains that he cannot determine
which portion of certain partially-redacted entries (totaling 14.2 hours)
pertain to the anti-SLAPP motion…Plaintiff’s complaint is disingenuous.” (Reply
at p. 6:4-6.) As set forth above, Wood’s counsel notes that “[a]ll entries
related to work that did not concern the anti-SLAPP motion are redacted as Ms.
Wood is not seeking to recover fees unrelated to the anti-SLAPP motion.” (Kump
Decl., ¶ 11.) Wood also states that “[a]s Plaintiff acknowledges, Wood’s
counsel have already reduced the three time entries that included both
compensable and not compensable tasks. This is clear from the invoices.” (See
Reply at p. 6:7-13, citing Trugman Ex. A.) 
            Wood
also asserts that “[t]he other partially-redacted entries identified by
Plaintiff include only compensable time related to the anti-SLAPP motion and
are redacted to protect privilege and attorney work product.” (Reply at p.
6:14-15, emphasis omitted.) Wood asserts that “[s]uch redactions in no way
impair the Court’s ability to analyze the fees incurred in connection with the
anti-SLAPP proceedings and still provide far more detail than an attorney
declaration listing the time spent on various categories of tasks.” (Reply at
p. 6:21-23.) Wood cites to Sweetwater Union High School Dist. v. Julian
Union Elementary School Dist. (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th 970, 995-996, where the Court of Appeal noted that “[a]ppellants also complain
that Sweetwater did not present billing
timesheets to support their request, but presented declarations with general
summaries of blocked-billing statements. The law is clear, however,
that an award of attorney fees may be based on counsel’s declarations,
without production of detailed time records. Here, the three attorneys
primarily involved in the litigation provided declarations under penalty of
perjury supporting the hours sought, which were broken down by hours expended
in each category of services rendered. The same trial judge presided
over the entire matter, was familiar with the record and issues, and was thus
well equipped to evaluate the reasonableness of the time expended by Sweetwater’s counsel. The lack of
detailed billing statements perhaps is relevant to the credibility of [the
attorney’s declaration]; however, the lack of billing statements does not
automatically establish that there was insufficient evidence for the trial
court to render a decision.” (Internal quotations and citations omitted.) Similarly
here, Wood’s counsel’s declaration under penalty of perjury provides a summary of “[t]he
services provided in connection with the anti-SLAPP Motion, and the amount of
time spent by each attorney on these tasks…” (Kump Decl., ¶ 12.) 
            Plaintiff also asserts that “[a]
reduction of at least 20% is appropriate for the 73 time entries…that contain
improper block-billing.” (Opp’n at p. 5:20-21.) In
his declaration in support of the opposition, Plaintiff’s counsel states that “[a]ttached
hereto as Exhibit B is a set of annotated excerpts from Kump Decl. Ex. D in
which I have identified time entries that contain block-billing, i.e., multiple
tasks grouped into the same time entry.” (Trugman
Decl., ¶ 4.) But Plaintiff does not appear to point to any tasks in such time
entries that he asserts are not compensable. In Heritage
Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1010, cited by Plaintiff, the Court of Appeal noted
that “[t]rial courts retain discretion to
penalize block billing when the practice prevents them from discerning which
tasks are compensable and which are not.” Wood
also asserts that “the entries are sufficiently detailed to allow
the Court to evaluate the reasonableness of the time spent, particularly since
the grouped tasks are closely-related (e.g., ‘research and draft,’ ‘draft and
revise,’ ‘prepare for and attend,’ etc.).” (Reply at p. 7:21-23.) The Court
agrees. (See Trugman Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. B.)  
            Based
on the foregoing, the Court declines to reduce from the total amount of fees
requested the fees for the partially redacted time entries and purported
block-billed time entries. 
            In his
declaration in support of the opposition, Plaintiff’s counsel also states that
“[a]ttached hereto as Exhibit C is a set of annotated excerpts from Kump
Decl. Ex. D in which I have identified vague and non-descriptive billing
entries...” (Trugman Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. C.) 
Plaintiff points to, inter alia, certain billing entries from
November 28, 2022, 
November
29, 2022, March 1, 2023, March 8, 2023, March 9, 2023, March 14, 2023, March
16, 2023, March 17, 2023, March 20, 2023, March 22, 2023, and March 29, 2023
for services described as “Issues regarding anti-SLAPP motion” and “Anti-SLAPP
issues.” (Trugman Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. C.) Plaintiff also points to time entries for
“Analysis and research regarding anti-SLAPP issues” from November 11, 2022 and
November 14, 2022, as well as a time entry for “Analysis and research regarding
anti-SLAPP issues” from March 3, 2023.” (Trugman Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. C.) The Court
agrees with Plaintiff that the foregoing entries are vague, such that it is
difficult to determine whether the time spent on such tasks was reasonable. Thus,
the Court deducts $9,070.00 from the total amount of fees requested. (See
Trugman Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. C; above-referenced time entries.)
            Plaintiff also asserts that “some
entries are…too vague [even] to attribute to preparation of the anti-SLAPP
motion.” (Opp’n at p. 6:21-22.) Plaintiff notes that Wood seeks reimbursement
for the following services: “[t]elephone conference with client re motion,” and
“[p]repare oppositions.” (Trugman Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. C; see April 13, 2022
and July 29, 2022 entries.) These entries do not describe which specific motion
or opposition the entries pertain to. The Court thus deducts $1,020.00 from the
total amount of fees requested. (See Trugman Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. C;
above-referenced time entries.)           
Plaintiff also highlights time entries from August 1, 2022 and August
2, 2022 to “[p]repare motion to allow discovery.” (Trugman Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. C.)
Plaintiff asserts that “only [Plaintiff] filed such a motion, which Wood
opposed.” (Opp’n at p. 6:28.) In addition, Plaintiff notes that that “Kump also
billed 0.7 hours to ‘Discovery issues regarding SLAPP motion’—four months after
the Court’s discovery ruling when no discovery or discovery ‘issues’ were
pending here.” (Opp’n at p. 6:28-7:2; see Trugman Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. C,
January 12, 2023 entry.)[2] Wood
does not appear to address these points in the reply. Thus, the Court deducts
$2,295.00 from the total amount of fees requested. (See Trugman Decl., ¶
5, Ex. C; above-referenced time entries.)
            Plaintiff further asserts that
“Wood’s fee request also is inflated because partners were used exclusively for
tasks typically done by more cost-effective attorneys.” (Opp’n at p. 7:8-9.)
Plaintiff asserts that “[t]he most junior attorney who did any legal research,
initial drafting, or proof-reading was Ms. Kleindienst, a partner, who charged
$625-650 per hour. An associate-level attorney was used just once, late in the
proceeding, ‘to help with the objections to Plaintiff’s evidence.’ Mot. at
14:3-9. The Motion offers no explanation for why more cost-effective attorneys
were not used to offset the hundreds of partner-hours expended for research,
drafting, and proofing.” (Opp’n at p. 7:13-18.) 
            In the reply, Wood counters that
“[t]he attorney with the lowest billing rate performed the vast majority of the
work…When additional help was needed to prepare the reply papers, a senior
associate was brought in to draft evidentiary objections…There was nothing
improper about these staffing decisions.” (Reply at p. 9:13-16.) Wood also
asserts that “[t]his lean staffing results in more efficiency, not less.
Instead of having multiple levels of review and duplicated work, virtually all
of the work on this matter was performed by just two attorneys with intimate
knowledge of the case.” (Reply at p. 9:21-23, citing Kump Decl. ¶ 12, emphasis
omitted.) 
            Plaintiff also asserts that “Ms.
Kleindienst alone spent approximately 77.4 hours researching, drafting, and
revising the anti-SLAPP motion” and that “[t]ogether with Mr. Kump, these two
partners spent a staggering 90.6 hours on Wood’s submission.” (Opp’n at p.
7:24-25, citing Trugman Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. D and Mot. at p. 11:19-22.) In
addition, Plaintiff asserts that “Ms. Kleindienst spent a similarly excessive
amount of time—approximately 65 hours—researching, drafting, revising, and
proof-reading an opposition to [Plaintiff’s] motion for limited discovery.”
(Opp’n at pp. 7:27-8:1, citing Trugman Decl., ¶ 7, Ex. E.) In addition,
Plaintiff asserts that “Ms. Kleindienst also spent an unreasonable 45.8 hours
researching, drafting, and revising Wood’s reply in support of the anti-SLAPP
motion.” (Opp’n at p. 8:4-5, citing Trugman Decl., ¶ 8, Ex. F.) Plaintiff
argues that “if Wood was going to rely exclusively on experienced,
partner-level attorneys for research and writing, the time billed should have
been far more efficient.” (Opp’n at p. 8:7-8.) 
            In the reply, Wood argues that “[a]part
from the false comparison to Gore’s billing records, Plaintiff has not even
attempted to explain why the 90.6 hours spent analyzing, researching, and
preparing the anti-SLAPP motion and supporting papers was unreasonable.
Accordingly, Wood must be reimbursed for the fees incurred.” (Mot. at p. 10:23-26.)
Wood cites to Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th
459, 488, where the
Court of Appeal noted that “Plaintiff
contends that the amount awarded to defendants for attorney fees—$104,293.75 to
Nunez and Newport, and $57,765.63 to Wasserman—was excessive…In challenging
attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, it
is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific items
challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence. General
arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not
suffice…” (Internal quotations omitted.) 
            But here,
Plaintiff argues that “the partners’ time entries reflect excessive and
inefficient hours spent on tasks like research and writing, which is
inconsistent with the claimed experience and expertise justifying their high
rates.” (Opp’n at p. 7:20-22.) The Court agrees that the 83.3 hours expended by
Ms. Kleindienst for “[r]esearching, drafting, and revising Wood’s anti-SLAPP
motion, request for judicial notice, and other supporting papers, including
declarations and evidence” (Kump Decl., ¶ 12(a)) is excessive. The Court also
agrees that the 69.6 hours expended by Ms. Kleindienst for “[r]esearching,
drafting, and revising Wood’s Opposition to Plaintiff’s motion for anti-SLAPP
discovery and supporting papers” (Kump Decl., ¶ 12(c)) is excessive. Thus, the
Court deducts these amounts by 20%, or a total of 30.58 hours. At 
Ms.
Kleindienst’s rate of $625 per hour (Kump Decl., ¶ 9), the Court deducts
$19,112.50 from the total amount of fees requested (30.58 x $625/hour).
            Plaintiff also states in the
opposition that “counsel appears to have spent at least 26.1 hours…preparing 97
objections to [Plaintiff’s] anti-SLAPP opposition evidence…” (Opp’n at p.
10:2-3, citing Trugman Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. L, emphasis omitted.) Plaintiff notes
that on December 1, 2022, the Court issued an Order, inter alia,
continuing the hearing on Wood’s motion due to the voluminous number of
evidentiary objections. In his supporting declaration, Mr. Kump indicates that
he and Ms. Kleindienst spent a total of 61.2 hours “[m]eeting and conferring
with Plaintiff and Defendant Gore to consolidate and reduce the evidentiary
objections and drafting a 54-page Joint Statement regarding the remaining
evidentiary objections.” (Kump Decl., ¶ 12(g).) 
Plaintiff argues that “[i]t is unclear why objections took so much
time (87.3 hours) given that (i) most of the evidence had already been
thoroughly considered four months earlier, in connection with the discovery
motion, (ii) the December 1 mandate was to ‘eliminate,’ and (iii) Wood’s and
Gore’s counsel supposedly worked together on a joint list of objections and
arguments.” (Opp’n at p. 10:9-13.) Plaintiff asserts that “[g]iven the Court’s
simple instruction, and dozens of hours already spent by Wood and Gore, the
more than 34 hours of yet additional time Wood’s team spent after December 30
further addressing Defendants’ objections should be reduced.” (Opp’n at p. 11:1-3,
citing Trugman Decl., ¶ 14, Ex. O, emphasis omitted.) Wood does not appear to
respond to or dispute this point in the reply. The Court thus finds that it is
appropriate to deduct $20,625.00 from the total amount of fees requested. (See
Trugman Decl., ¶ 14, Ex. O.) 
Plaintiff further asserts that “[i]t also appears that straightforward
matters were regularly over-litigated.” (Opp’n at p. 9:24.) Plaintiff asserts
that for example, “[t]wo partners spent at least 17.1 hours drafting an
opposition to a routine ex parte request to shorten time or in the alternative
continue a hearing,” and that “[t]wo partners spent 53.8 hours responding to a
four-page ex parte request to supplement the record with a three-page
declaration.” (Opp’n at p. 9:25-28, citing Trugman Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. K; Mot. at
p. 13:8-13.) Wood counters that she filed a “10-page response explaining that
Plaintiff had not only failed to show good cause for the relief sought, but
that the new Smithline declaration included demonstrable falsehoods and had
been obtained under unreliable circumstances. Wood’s opposition included three
supporting declarations, from Mr. Kump, Wood, and a third-party witness.”
(Reply at p. 11:13-17.) The Court does not find that Plaintiff has shown that
the time spent on the foregoing matters was unreasonable. 
            Plaintiff also asserts that “Wood’s
team further inflated the fee request with extensive internal duplication,
including by having two partner-level attorneys both prepare for and attend
court hearings and a deposition.” (Opp’n at p. 11:4-5.) In addition, Plaintiff
asserts that “Wood’s team duplicated efforts when, it appears, Mr. Kump
performed the same or similar work—often times on the same days.” (Opp’n at p.
12:10-11.)[3]
In his declaration, Plaintiff’s counsel states that “[a]ttached hereto
as Exhibit P is a set of annotated excerpts from Kump Decl. Ex. D in which I
have identified time entries related to preparing and attending hearings for
which both Mr. Kump and Ms. Kleindienst billed time.” (Trugman Decl., ¶ 15, Ex.
P.) A summary of such entries is set forth in paragraph 15 of Plaintiff’s
counsel’s declaration. (Trugman Decl., ¶ 15.) Wood asserts that “it is not
unreasonable (or uncommon) for two attorneys to attend hearings, particularly
in a high-stakes, high-profile case like this one.” (Reply at p. 12:16-17.) The
Court does not find that the time identified in paragraph 15 of Mr. Trugman’s
declaration is unreasonable. 
            Plaintiff asserts
that “[f]urther compounding the duplication issue, both Ms. Kleindienst
and Mr. Kump spent dozens of hours re-preparing for hearings that were
continued by the Court, after spending dozens of hours preparing originally.”
(Opp’n at p. 11:24-26.) In his supporting declaration,
Wood’s counsel states that “counsel prepared for the discovery motion
hearing on two separate occasions because it was originally set for hearing on
August 18, 2022, but was continued by the Court the night before the hearing,
and heard more than a month later, on September 27, 2022.” (Kump Decl., ¶
12(d).) With regard to “[p]reparing for and appearing at the hearing on the
anti-SLAPP motion,” Wood’s counsel states that “[c]ounsel prepared for the
hearing in both April and May of 2023 because the hearing was originally set
for April 11, 2023, but then was continued to May 9, 2023 due to the breadth
and complexity of the issues…” (Kump Decl., ¶ 12(j).) Wood asserts that there
is not “anything unreasonable about spending additional time to prepare for an
important hearing after it has been continued for a month or more.” (Reply at
p. 12:21-22.) The Court agrees. 
Plaintiff also asserts that “[b]etween April 20 and April 28, 2022,
Mr. Kump billed 7.1 hours as ‘Prepare anti- [SLAPP] motion to strike’; Ms.
Kleindienst spent 73.2 hours doing the same.” (Opp’n at p. 12:22-23, citing
Kump Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. D.) The Court notes that the billing entries between
April 20, 2022 and April 28, 2022 listed in Wood’s Exhibit D do not appear to
add up to the foregoing amounts. (Kump Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. D.) 
Plaintiff also states that “[o]n July 15, 2022, Mr. Kump billed 1.0
hour as ‘Analysis and research re lifting of discovery stay’; Ms. Kleindienst
spent 1.5 hours doing the same on July 14 and 17.” (Opp’n at p. 12:24-25, see
Kump Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. D.) The Court does not find that these entries are unreasonable
or duplicative.  
Plaintiff also asserts that “[o]n July 21, 2022, Mr. Kump billed 2.7
hours as ‘Prepar[ing] [Wood’s] opposition’ to an ex parte application; Ms.
Kleindienst spent 11.4 hours doing the same.” (Opp’n at p. 12:25-26.) The Court
notes that it is unable to find such billing entries from Ms. Kleindienst that
total 11.4 hours. Plaintiff does not identify the dates of Ms. Kleindienst’s
billing entries he is referring to. 
Plaintiff also states that “[o]n July 25, 2022, Mr. Kump billed 1.0
hours to ‘Research re opposition to discovery motion’; Ms. Kleindienst spent
5.1 hours on the same task the same day (plus more on other days).” (Opp’n at
p. 12:27-28, see Kump Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. D.) The Court does not find that
these entries are unreasonable or duplicative. 
Plaintiff asserts that “[b]etween July 28 and August 5, 2022, Mr. Kump
billed 4.2 hours as ‘Prepare opposition to discovery motion’; Ms. Kleindienst
spent 65 hours doing the same.” (Opp’n at p. 13:1-2.) The Court notes that the
billing entries for Ms. Kleindienst between July 28 and August 5, 2022 do not
appear to add up to 65 hours, and Plaintiff does not identify the dates of the
specific entries for Ms. Kleindienst that he is referring to. 
In addition, Plaintiff asserts that “[b]etween November 15 and 22, Mr.
Kump billed 12.3 hours as ‘Preparation of reply to SLAPP motion’ (and the
like); Ms. Kleindienst spent 45.8 hours on the same.” (Opp’n at p. 13:3-4, Kump
Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. D.) The Court does not find that these entries are unreasonable
or duplicative. 
Plaintiff also asserts that “[b]etween February 26 and 27, Mr. Kump
billed 7.0 hours as “Prepare opposition to ex parte application”; Ms.
Kleindienst spent 34.7 hours doing the same.” (Opp’n at p. 13:5-6.) The Court
notes that the billing entries for Ms. Kleindienst from February 26, 2023 and
February 27, 2023 do not appear to add up to 34.7 hours. (See Kump
Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. D.)
In addition, Plaintiff asserts that “Ms. Mason, who charges $295 per
hour for paralegal work, also appears to have spent excessive and inexplicable
amounts of time on clerical tasks, including an 11.0 hour block preparing
courtesy copy binders, 5.0 hours ‘review[ing] and combin[ing] Wood and Gore’s
Evidentiary Objections,’ and 3.0 hours ‘review[ing] and redlin[ing] Gore and
Woods evidentiary objections.’” (Opp’n at p. 13:7-11, citing Trugman Decl., ¶
16, Ex. Q.) Plaintiff asserts that “[t]here is no explanation for ‘redlin[ing]’
objections weeks after they had already been ‘combined.’” (Opp’n at p.
13:13-14.) The Court notes that Wood does not appear to respond to this point
in the reply. Thus, the Court deducts the three hours to “Review and redline
Gore and Woods evidentiary objections,” which totals $825.00.  
(Trugman
Decl., ¶ 16, Ex. Q.)[4] 
As set forth above, Wood also seeks an additional $22,050.00 in
connection with preparing the present instant motion. (Kump Decl., ¶¶ 21-22.)
Wood anticipates incurring $10,100.00 in attorneys’ fees in connection with the
reply brief and hearing on the instant motion. (Kump Decl., ¶¶ 23-24.) 
Plaintiff asserts that Wood’s request for fees incurred making the
instant motion is unreasonable. Plaintiff notes that Mr. Kump states in his
supporting declaration that “Ms. Kleindienst spent 26.2 hours researching,
drafting, and preparing this Fee Motion and the supporting declaration, which
at a rate of $650 per hour, equates to $17,030 in attorneys’ fees. I spent 2.3
hours reviewing and revising the Fees Motion and my declaration, which at a
rate of $900 per hour equates to $2,070 in attorneys’ fees.” (Kump Decl., ¶
21.) Mr. Kump further states that “I anticipate that I will spend 4 hours
revising the Reply brief and preparing for and attending the hearing on this
motion.” (Kump Decl., ¶ 24.) Plaintiff asserts that “[b]ecause Wood ‘present[s]
nothing more, such as timesheets or other evidence setting forth the breakdown
of time in relation to services provided,’ the request is ‘unsupported by the
requisite evidence necessary’ to award the amount sought.” (Opp’n at p.
15:20-22.)[5] Wood
counters that “[t]he law is clear…that an award
of attorney fees may be based on counsel’s declarations, without production of
detailed time records.” (Sweetwater Union High School
Dist. v. Julian Union Elementary School Dist., supra, 36 Cal.App.5th at p. 995.) 
Plaintiff also asserts that “[r]egardless, 26.2 hours to prepare a
straightforward motion is excessive—e.g., Wood did not need to cite over a
dozen cases in which courts awarded ‘six-figure fee awards,’ Mot. at 8:20-9:18,
when there is no dispute that each fee request ‘must be assessed on its own
merits,’…” (Opp’n at p. 15:23-25.) In the motion, Wood cites to Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. California Ins.
Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 561, where the Court of Appeal noted that “each fee application under section
425.16, subdivision (c) must be assessed on its own merits according to the
principles discussed in Ketchum,
taking into account what is reasonable under the circumstances.” The
Court agrees and deducts 5 hours from the total hours requested, which totals $3,250
(5 x $650/hr). (See Kump Decl., ¶ 21.)  
            Lastly, as to Wood’s requested
$9,193.67 in costs, Wood’s counsel states that “[t]hese charges include filing
fees, online research fees, messenger services, and court reporting services
and are reflected in the invoices attached as Exhibit D.” (Kump Decl., ¶ 20.) 
In the opposition, Plaintiff asserts that Wood seeks reimbursement for
non-compensable costs. Plaintiff states that Wood seeks reimbursement for
$3,096.57 in Westlaw research charges (Trugman Decl., ¶ 17, Ex. R), and notes
that such charges are not listed as a reimbursable cost category in Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5. Plaintiff also
notes that “[c]ounsel does not explain the charges at all, and their (not
Westlaw’s) invoices make it impossible to determine that the research even
related to the anti-SLAPP motion.” (Opp’n at p. 14:28-15:2.) In the reply, Wood
does not appear to cite any binding legal authority supporting her request for
research costs. Thus, the Court deducts $3,096.57 from the total amount of
costs requested.  
            Plaintiff also asserts that “Wood
seeks reimbursement for $1,249.30 in unauthorized transcript charges…She
ordered a transcript from Gore’s deposition [sic] $935.10, even though
deposition transcripts are not listed under Section
1033.5, and the transcript was an exhibit to Warner’s anti-SLAPP opposition
and Gore’s reply.” (Opp’n at p. 15:5-8, citing Trugman Decl., ¶ 17, Ex. R) Wood
does not appear to cite to legal authority supporting this request for costs.
Thus, the Court deducts $1,249.30 from the total amount of costs
requested.  
Plaintiff also notes that Wood “seeks $314.20 for transcripts from the
September 27, 2022, December 1, 2022, and February 7, 2023 hearings.” (Opp’n at
p. 15:8-9, Trugman Decl., ¶ 17, Ex. R) Plaintiff asserts that such transcripts
are excluded because there were not “ordered” by the Court. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (b)(5), “[t]he following items are not allowable as costs, except
when expressly authorized by law:…(5) Transcripts of court proceedings not ordered
by the court.” In addition, Plaintiff asserts that such
transcripts were not “reasonably necessary” because the motions they concerned
had already been ruled on and/or fully briefed. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (c)(2), “[a]llowable costs shall be reasonably necessary to the
conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its
preparation.” Wood does not appear to respond to these points in the reply. Thus,
the Court deducts $314.20 from the total amount of costs requested.  
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Wood’s motion for
attorneys’ fees and costs is granted in part. 
The Court awards Wood $293,522.50 in
attorneys’ fees and $4,533.60 in costs incurred in connection with Wood’s
special motion to strike. The Court awards Wood $18,800.00 in attorneys’ fees
incurred in connection with preparing the instant motion, and $10,100.00 in
attorneys’ fees incurred by Wood in connection with the reply brief and hearing
on the instant motion.
