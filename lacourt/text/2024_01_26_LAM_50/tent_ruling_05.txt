[1]Gore also moved to
strike Plaintiff’s Complaint pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 425.16. As set forth in the Court’s May 9, 2023
Order, Gore’s special motion to strike was also granted in part. 


[2]The Court notes
that on September 27, 2022, the Court issued an Order on “Plaintiff’s Motion to
Conduct Limited Discovery Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 425.16(g) and Request for a Continuance of Defendants’
Motions to Strike to Permit Such Limited Discovery.” 


[3]Plaintiff cites to
Ketchum v. Moses, supra,
24 Cal.4th at pages 1131-1132, where the California Supreme Court noted that “[u]nder Serrano III, a court assessing attorney fees
begins with a touchstone or lodestar figure, based on the ‘careful compilation
of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney . . .
involved in the presentation of the case.’…In referring to ‘reasonable’
compensation, we indicated that trial courts must carefully review attorney
documentation of hours expended; ‘padding’ in the form of inefficient or
duplicative efforts is not subject to compensation.” (Emphasis in original.)


[4]Plaintiff also asserts that “[t]he work to assemble
courtesy copies also appears duplicative of $613.18 in vendor charges for the
same project,” (Opp’n at p. 13:11-12), but it is unclear what charges Plaintiff
is referring to. 
 


[5]Plaintiff cites
to Maughan v.
Google Technology, Inc. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1253, where the Court of Appeal noted that “a
review of the record establishes that Google’s request for fees and costs
incurred in making the fees and costs motion was unsupported by the requisite
evidence necessary for the court to exercise its discretion.”
