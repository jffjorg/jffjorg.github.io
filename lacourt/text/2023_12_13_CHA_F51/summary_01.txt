And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel further responses to the requests for production of documents, filed by the plaintiff, Arman Petrosyan, against the defendant, General Motors, LLC. The plaintiff seeks to compel the defendant to provide further responses to its requests for production of documents, which were initially served on October 5, 2023. The defendant objected to the requests, arguing that they were overbroad and unduly burdensome.

The judge found that the defendant's objections were meritless and that the plaintiff had provided sufficient cause for production of the subject documents. The judge also noted that the defendant had failed to provide evidence of any undue burden or oppression in responding to the requests.

The judge ordered the defendant to provide further code-compliant responses to the requests for production of documents within 30 days. The judge also imposed sanctions against the defendant in the amount of $790.00, which is intended to compensate the plaintiff for the time and effort spent on the motion.

The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure, the California Civil Code, and the Evidence Code, and is guided by the principles of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.
