And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to requests for production and special interrogatories. The plaintiff, Roland Esparza, filed the motion against the defendants, Conagra Brands, Inc., The Vons Companies, Inc., and Full-Fill Industries, LLC, alleging that the defendants' responses to the discovery requests were incomplete or inadequate. The defendants argued that their responses were timely and that the plaintiff did not request an extension to compel further responses. The judge has denied the motion to compel, finding that it was not timely filed. The plaintiff did not request an extension and did not move to compel further responses until five months after the deadline. As a result, the judge has denied the motion to compel and ordered the moving party to give notice.
