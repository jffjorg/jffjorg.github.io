[1]           In the moving papers, REV inadvertently
provided an FSA between BaronHR LLC and REV, not BaronHR West Inc. and REV.
(Shifrin Decl. ¶ 21 & Ex. B; Shifrin Reply Decl. ¶ 4.) REV provided the FSA
between it and BaronHR West Inc. with the reply. (Shifrin Reply Decl. ¶ 6 &
Ex. F.) Normally, new evidence on reply is prohibited. (See Jay v. Mahaffey
(2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1537 [“The general rule of motion practice, which
applies here, is that new evidence is not permitted with reply papers”].)
However, it appears that, except for the seller of the Accounts, i.e.,
BaronHR LLC instead of BaronHR West Inc., the terms are identical. (Shifrin
Reply Decl. ¶¶ 5, 6.)  During the hearing
on June 24, 2024, defendants, if they so wish, will be provided a full
opportunity to argue whether or not the FSA submitted with the reply granted
REV a security interest in BaronHR West Inc.’s Accounts.
