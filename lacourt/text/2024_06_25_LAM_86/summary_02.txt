And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the moving papers and has noticed an error in the Financial Services Agreement (FSA) submitted by REV. The FSA submitted with the initial papers is between BaronHR LLC and REV, not between BaronHR West Inc. and REV. However, REV did provide the correct FSA between it and BaronHR West Inc. with its reply papers. Although new evidence is normally not permitted with reply papers, the judge has made an exception in this case because the terms of the two FSAs are identical, except for the seller of the Accounts. The judge will provide defendants with a full opportunity to argue during the hearing on June 24, 2024, about whether the FSA submitted with the reply granted REV a security interest in BaronHR West Inc.'s Accounts.
