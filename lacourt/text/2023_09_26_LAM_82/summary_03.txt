## English Summary:

The judge in this case is recommending to **grant** the Receiver's motion to disburse the $100,000 escrow deposit held by Fidelity Title.  

The background of the case is a failed sale of a property in Inglewood, California. The original buyer, Victoria Green, entered into a Residential Purchase Agreement with the Receiver. Green later assigned her rights under the agreement to Anonymity Assets, LLC. 

Anonymity failed to transfer the full purchase price by a deadline set in the Holding Escrow Agreement, leading to the Receiver's motion to keep the deposit. 

Anonymity argued against the motion on several grounds, including lack of notice, lack of jurisdiction over Fidelity Title and itself, and claiming the Receiver hindered the closing. 

The judge found these arguments unpersuasive.  Anonymity was able to participate in the proceedings despite not being formally served with the motion.  The judge also found that both Fidelity Title and Anonymity were subject to California jurisdiction because of their involvement in the transaction. Anonymity failed to provide specific evidence that the Receiver withheld necessary documents.

Therefore, the judge recommends granting the Receiver's motion to keep the $100,000 deposit.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of the receiver, Pacific Crest Realty Advisors, LLC, to disburse the escrow agreement funds related to the failed sale of a property located at 3500 W Manchester Blvd, Unit 421, Inglewood, CA 90305. The buyer, Victoria Green, had assigned her rights under the Residential Purchase Agreement to Anonymity Assets, LLC, which had deposited $100,000 into escrow. However, the sale did not close by the deadline of August 7, 2023, and the receiver is now entitled to retain the deposit as liquidated damages. Anonymity opposed the motion, arguing that the receiver had not served the motion on them, that the court lacked jurisdiction over Fidelity Title, and that the receiver had caused the sale not to close by failing to provide necessary documents. However, the judge found that Anonymity's opposition was sufficient to waive any defects in service, that the court had jurisdiction over Fidelity Title, and that Anonymity had failed to specify what documents were needed to close the sale. The judge therefore granted the motion, ordering the receiver to serve and lodge a proposed order for the court's signature.
