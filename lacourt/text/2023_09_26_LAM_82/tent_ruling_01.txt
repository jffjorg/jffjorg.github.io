[TENTATIVE] RULING ON VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT
  OF MANDAMUS
 
Dept. 82 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)
 
 




 


 


 


 



            Petitioner Ray Alvin Renneker, dba
California Construction Services, in propria persona, petitions for a writ of
administrative mandate directing respondents Contractors State License Board (“CSLB”),
Department of Consumer Affairs for the State of California, and David R. Fogt,
Registrar of Contracts to set aside a finding of culpability and the imposition
of certain monetary penalties in CSLB’s decision revoking petitioner’s contractor’s
license, staying the revocation, and placing petitioner on probation for three
years.
 
I.       Factual Background
 
            Petitioner Ray Alvin Renneker had
his contractor’s license suspended based on respondent Contractors State
License Board’s finding that he hired Jason Schlessinger, who previously had
his licensed revoked, to manage two construction projects – the 12th
Avenue Project and the Acapulco Street Project, in violation of Business and
Professions Code § 7121. 
 
On
August 16, 1999, respondent Contractors State License Board (“CSLB”) issued a contractor’s
license to petitioner Ray Alvin Renneker, owner of California Construction
Services (“CCS”). (AR 34-35.) The license is classified as type B (General
Building Contractor) and type C-35 (Lathing and Plastering). (Id.)
 
Petitioner
employed Jason Schlessinger, his father-in-law. (AR 1939.) Schlessinger had a contractor’s
license in the name of California Stucco. (AR 180-81.) That license was revoked
on March 31, 1998, after Schlessinger received 12 consumer complaints. (AR 102,
181-82.)
A.          
12th
Avenue Project
            
In
June 2017, homeowner S.B.’s property on 12th Avenue in Inglewood
experienced water damage from a leaking pipe in the wall of the only bathroom.
(AR 244, 802.) S.B. hired Leland Coontz, a public adjuster, to represent him in
his homeowner’s insurance claim. (AR 244.) Because the project involved
construction in the only bathroom, S.B. and his family stayed in a hotel during
the project. (AR 244-45.) S.B.’s homeowner’s insurance policy allocated a
limited amount of funds to cover temporary living expenses. (AR 245.)
 
Due
to inadequate work by a prior contractor for S.B.’s property, Coontz hired CCS
to finish the repairs. (AR 245.) Schlessinger was the first person S.B. met
from CCS. (AR 1130.) Schlessinger initially represented to S.B. that he was the
owner/contractor of CCS. (AR 1129.) Schlessinger later told S.B. that he gave
CCS to his son-in-law. (AR 1129.)
 
On
September 9, 2017, S.B. and Schlessinger discussed the remaining repairs. (AR
95.) Schlessinger looked at the bathroom and said he could make the repairs.
(AR 1130.) Schlessinger provided an estimate. (AR 1130.) Schlessinger told S.B.
that the project would be completed before S.B.’s temporary living expense allowance
ran out. (AR 99, 245, 1130-31.) 
 
Schlessinger
presented S.B. with a contract to sign. (AR 98, 804.) The price of the project
was indicated as “Insurance Proceeds Only.” (AR 245, 278.) The contract was signed
on behalf of CCS with a rubber stamp of petitioner Renneker’s signature. (AR
109, 278.) Petitioner did not personally negotiate the contract. (AR 1990
[petitioner testified that he negotiated contract with S.B. through
Schlessinger and Coontz].) On September 9, 2017, S.B. paid Schlessinger $5,000 as
a retainer to begin the project. (AR 97, 128, 1134.)
 
Schlessinger
obtained permits for the project. (AR 814.) Schlessinger assembled a crew to appear
at S.B.’s home and work on the project. (AR 99.) As the project progressed,
S.B. noticed that the workers Schlessinger brought to the project changed daily.
(AR 245.) S.B. went with Schlessinger twice to Home Depot to pick up materials and
pick up workers. (AR 1138.)
 
S.B.
regularly visited the project and tried to record video of the work being done.
(AR 96, 99.) S.B. also noticed that the building department issued numerous
inspection notices on September 29, 2017. (AR 96, 245.) S.B. alerted
Schlessinger to his findings and his concern that the project would not be
finished before his temporary living expenses were exhausted. (AR 96, 99.) To
continue the project, on October 10, 2017, Schlessinger requested a second
payment of $5,000, which S.B. paid. (AR 99, 129, 245.)
 
Due
to the issuance of the additional inspection notices, S.B. asked Schlessinger
to accelerate the project so that S.B. would not have to pay temporary living
expenses out of pocket. (AR 245-46.) Schlessinger required an additional
payment to continue the project. (AR 246.) Based on the lack of progress on the
project, S.B. refused to make any additional payments. (AR 246.)
 
On
September 20, 2017, S.B. filed a complaint with CSLB. (AR 106-07, 246.) Soon
after S.B. submitted the complaint, the workers removed their tools and
abandoned the project. (AR 0246.) Schlessinger demanded the withdrawal of the
complaint or else he would not restart the project. (AR 99, 246.)
 
As
admitted by petitioner, S.B. never saw or met petitioner during the project.
(AR 246, 1941-42.) 
 
B.          
Acapulco
Street Project
 
In
March 2017, CCS entered into a contract with homeowner A.G. to replace the stucco
on the exterior of his Laguna Beach home located on Acapulco Street. (AR 222.)
When A.G. brought cracks in the stucco to the attention of David Silverstein,
the project manager, Silverstein referred A.G. to Schlessinger. (AR 216.) Schlessinger
told A.G. he was the company manager of CCS. (AR 216, 223.)
 
On
November 10, 2017, A.G. filed a complaint against CCS with CSLB. (AR 223.) CCS
sent preliminary lien notices against A.G.’s property to A.G. (AR 223.) 
 
A.G.
filed a small claims action against CCS. (AR 223.) The action was resolved at
mediation through a stipulated judgment, which Schlessinger negotiated and
signed on behalf of CCS. (AR 210, 223.) A.G. was required under the stipulated
judgment to withdraw his CSLB complaint against CCS. (AR 210, 223.)
 
Petitioner
admitted to the CSLB investigator that Schlessinger was a manager of CCS. (AR
1269.) Petitioner also testified during the hearing that Schlessinger managed
the project administratively. (AR 1972.) According to the investigator, petitioner
could not recall key details, including the owner’s name, with respect to the
Acapulco Street Project. (AR 216, 1269.)
 
C.          
Disciplinary
Proceedings
 
The
administrative hearing took place before Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”)
Joseph D. Montoya on November 9, 10, and 12, 2020, and on January 25, 26, and
28, 2021. (AR 891.) While several claims pertained to defective workmanship on
the 12th Avenue Project and the Acapulco Street Project, the only
claim at issue in the instant proceeding before this Court is petitioner’s
hiring of Schlessinger in a managerial capacity in violation of Business and
Professions Code § 7121. (Pet. ¶ 7.)  
 
            The ALJ found that CLSB did not
prove by clear and convincing evidence that petitioner employed Schlessinger in
a managerial or supervisor capacity on the 12th Avenue Project. (AR 820,
826.) Based on other violations (including requiring excessive down payments
and construction below accepted trade standards), the
ALJ
ordered the revocation of petitioner’s license, a stay of the revocation, and
probation for three years. (AR 826, 829.) The ALJ also ordered petitioner to
pay $12,000 in costs. (AR 830.) 
 
            On March 16, 2021, CSLB rejected the
decision of the ALJ. (See AR 892.) On July 1, 2021, CSLB issued a new
decision, wherein CSLB found that petitioner employed Schlessinger in a
managerial or supervisory capacity in violation of section 7121. (AR 919.) CSLB
made the following factual findings (with “Respondent” referring to petitioner
Ray Alvin Renneker):
 
41.
Schlessinger is Respondent's father-in-law, and works for Respondent. Respondent
testified to this fact under direct examination- when asked “[i]s Mr. Schlessinger
currently an employee of [CCS]?” Respondent answered “yes, he, is.” 
 
42.
S.B. credibly testified that he only dealt with Schlessinger, and that he never
dealt with Respondent Renneker. This is buttressed by Renneker's testimony-admitting
at the hearing under direct examination to having no contact with S.B. during
the 12th Avenue project. In addition, S.B. testified Schlessinger initially
represented to him that he was the “owner contractor” of CCS, although
Schlessinger later acknowledged he gave the company to his son-in-law. Further,
it was Schlessinger who brought the home improvement contract to S.B. for
signature, and Schlessinger pulled the permits for the job on behalf of CCS. 
 
43.
S.B. further testified that Schlessinger (a) examined the property, (b) provided
the estimate for the project, (c) stated CCS could do the repairs, and (d) received
two $5,000 payments from S.B. on September 9, 2017 and October 10, 2017, respectively,
to commence work on the project. 
 
44.
In addition, evidence introduced and admitted at the hearing establishes Schlessinger
prepared the Xactimate report for the estimate on the 12th Avenue project.
Respondent testified he “was not familiar with Xactimate.”
 
45.
The record indicates that the workmen generally communicated to Respondent
through the office secretary, Daisy, or through Schlessinger. 
 
46.
Respondent testified that Schlessinger did not provide management for CCS, and
was simply an “administrative person.” However, Respondent admitted that Schlessinger
would also perform tasks such as scheduling, hiring personnel, assist with oral
interviews, and obtain materials for the workers. Respondent also sought
Schlessinger's professional opinion because of his vast knowledge, and
according to Respondent “knows what he's doing.” 
 
47.
Respondent further testified he negotiated the contract for the 12th
avenue project “though Jason [Schlessinger],” and it was Schlessinger who
delivered the contract to S.B. 
 
.
. .
 
65.
Moreover. Respondent Renneker told CSLB Special Investigator Huy Vo that
Schlessinger is "employed as a manager," to act on behalf of CCS. 

(AR 906-07, 911, 919, citations omitted.)
 
            CSLB ordered the revocation of
petitioner’s license, a stay of the revocation, and probation for three years.
(AR 921.) CSLB also ordered petitioner to pay $14,516 in costs and to post a
disciplinary bond in the amount of $15,000 for the period of probation. (AR 922.)

 
II.      Procedural History
 
             On August 31, 2021, petitioner filed a
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandamus. On September 16, 2021, respondent filed
an Answer. 
 
            After
the withdrawal of petitioner’s counsel and several continuances of the trial
setting conference, on
June 20, 2023, petitioner in pro per filed an opening brief. On July 14,
2023, respondent CSLB filed an opposition. On September 11, 2023, petitioner
filed a reply. The Court has received an electronic copy of the administrative
record and a hard copy of the joint appendix.
 
III.     Standard of Review
 
            Under CCP § 1094.5(b), the pertinent
issues are whether the respondent has proceeded without jurisdiction, whether
there was a fair trial, and whether there was a prejudicial abuse of
discretion. An abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not
proceeded in the manner required by law, the decision is not supported by the
findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence. (CCP § 1094.5(b).)
 
Because
petitioner’s contractor’s license concerns a fundamental vested right, the Court
exercises its independent judgment on the record. (See Hughes v. Board of Architectural
Examiners (1998) 17 Cal.4th 763, 789 [citing cases where individual who
obtained license to engage in profession or vocation has fundamental vested
right].) Under the independent judgment test, “the
trial court not only examines the administrative record for errors of law, but
also exercises its independent judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a
limited trial de novo.” (Bixby, 4 Cal.3d at 143.) The court must
draw its own reasonable inferences from the evidence and make its own
credibility determinations. (Morrison v.
Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles Board of Commissioners (2003)
107 Cal. App. 4th 860, 868.) 
 
 “In exercising its independent judgment, a
trial court must afford a strong presumption of correctness concerning the
administrative findings, and the party challenging the administrative decision
bears the burden of convincing the court that the administrative findings are
contrary to the weight of the evidence.” 
(Fukuda v. City of Angels
(1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 817, internal quotations omitted.) A reviewing court
“will not act as counsel for either party to an appeal and will not assume the
task of initiating and prosecuting a search of the record for any purpose of
discovering errors not pointed out in the briefs.” (Fox v. Erickson (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d 740, 742.) When an appellant
challenges “‘the sufficiency of the evidence, all material evidence on the
point must be set forth and not merely their own evidence.” (Toigo v. Town
of Ross (1998) 70 Cal.App.4th 309, 317.) 

 
At
the agency level, the clear and convincing standard of proof applies to revoke
a contractor’s license. (Bus. & Prof. Code § 7090.) “For almost 45 years,
California trial courts have followed the rule laid down by Chamberlain
[69 Cal.App.3d 362] that a trial court exercising its independent judgment
under…section 1094.5 must determine whether the administrative agency’s
findings are supported by the preponderance of the evidence, notwithstanding
the clear and convincing evidence standard of proof applied in the underlying
administrative proceeding.” (Li v. Superior Court (2021) 69 Cal.App.5th
836, 843; see also Yazdi v. Dental Board of California (2020) 57
Cal.App.5th 25, 33; Ettinger v. Board of Medical Quality Assurance
(1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 853, 856 [“[T]he weight of the evidence standard…is
considered to be synonymous with the preponderance of the evidence
standard.”].)
 
Recently,
however, the Court of Appeal for the Third District held that “a trial court
reviewing an administrative agency’s findings under the independent judgment
standard of review in section 1094.5 must … account for the standard of proof
required and applied in the underlying proceeding.” (Li, 69 Cal.App.5th at
844.) Because the California Supreme Court has not addressed this issue, there
appears to be a conflict between Li and prior cases, including Ettinger
and Yazdi, regarding the standard of review in this writ action. As
between the two lines of cases, the Court finds the reasoning in Li to
be more persuasive. Accordingly, in the Court’s analysis below, the Court uses
the phrase “weight of the evidence” to refer to sufficient evidence to support
a finding taking into account the clear and convincing evidence standard of
proof applicable at the agency level with respect to the discipline imposed on
petitioner’s license.[1]
 
“[T]he propriety of a
penalty imposed by an administrative agency is a matter vested in the
discretion of the agency and its decision may not be disturbed unless there has
been a manifest abuse of discretion. [Citations.]” (Cadilla v. Board of
Medical Examiners (1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 961, 966; see also Williamson v. Board of Medical
Quality Assurance
(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1343, 1347.) If reasonable minds can differ about the
propriety of the disciplinary action, there is no abuse of discretion. (County
of Los Angeles v. Civil Service Commission (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 620, 634.)
 
IV.     Analysis
 
A.          
Matters
Before this Court 
 
Petitioner
argues that CSLB did not give an opportunity to petitioner to dispute the 12th
Avenue homeowner’s complaint. (AR 4:19-5:2.) Petitioner also appears to argue
that the revoked status of Schlessinger’s license exceeds the time purportedly
allowed for revocation under Business and Professions Code § 7102. (Reply at
14:3-16.)  In addition, petitioner seems
to take exception to the CSLB’s “dispositive legal conclusions” regarding petitioner’s
departure from trade standards, inclusion of prohibited language in the
settlement agreement, no contract price, and excessive down payment. (OB at 10-13;
cf. AR 918-19 [Legal Conclusion paragraphs 11, 14-16]) 
 
Notwithstanding
newly asserted grounds in the briefing, the instant proceeding is framed by the
allegations of the operative petition. (California Standardbred Sires Stakes
Com., Inc. v. California Horse Racing Bd. (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 751, 763
[verified petition under CCP § 1085 is like a complaint in a civil action]; Committee
On Children's Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197,
211-12 [complaint in a civil action serves to frame and limit the issues].)
Petitioner’s petition was based on the allegation that there was no evidence
that Schlessinger acted in a managerial or supervisory capacity. (Pet. ¶¶
11(a), 11(c)(i), 12.) Petitioner did not raise any due process or excessive
punishment concerns or disputes regarding CSLB’s legal conclusions set forth in
paragraph 11 and 14-16 of its decision. The Court accordingly does not address
extraneous issues raised in petitioner’s opening brief and reply. 
 
The
Court also notes that petitioner has attached various exhibits to his opening
brief—some of which do not bear a Bates stamp indicating they are part of the
administrative record. In general, “a hearing on a writ of administrative
mandamus is conducted solely on the record of the proceedings before the
administrative agency.” (Toyota of Visalia, Inc. v. New Motor Vehicle Bd.
(1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 872, 881.) Extra-record evidence may be admitted only if,
in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the relevant evidence could not have
been produced or was improperly excluded at the hearing. (CCP § 1094.5(e).) The
requirements to submit extra-record evidence are “stringent.” (Pomona Valley
Hosp. Med. Ctr. v. Superior Court (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 93, 102.) “If the
moving party fails to make the required showing, it is an abuse of the court's
discretion to … [augment the record].” (Ibid.)
 
Petitioner has not moved
to augment the record pursuant to CCP § 1094.5(e). Accordingly, the Court will
not consider any evidence that is not part of the certified administrative
record in this case.
 
B.          
Business
and Professions Code § 7121
 
Business
and Professions Code § 7121 states, in relevant part:
 
A
person…who has had his or her license revoked…or who has been a partner…of any partnership…whose
license has been revoked…and while acting as a partner, officer, director,
manager, or associate had knowledge of or participated in any of the prohibited
acts for which the license was denied, suspended, or revoked, shall be
prohibited from serving as an officer, director, associate, partner, manager,
qualifying individual, or member of the personnel of record of a licensee, and
the employment, election, or association of this type of person by a licensee
in any capacity other than as a nonsupervising bona fide employee shall
constitute grounds for disciplinary action.
 
(§
7121, emphasis added.)[2]

 
The
following facts are undisputed. Petitioner had a contractor’s license. (AR
34-35.)  Schlessinger had his
contractor’s license, as partner of California Stucco, revoked. (AR 181-82.) Petitioner
employed Schlessinger. (AR 1939.)
 
            Thus, the only question is whether petitioner
employed Schlessinger was “a nonsupervising bona fide employee” or not.  The evidence is clear (and convincing) that
Schlessinger played a managerial and supervisorial role in petitioner’s business.  The weight of the evidence demonstrates that
Schlessinger acted as a supervisor on both the 12th Avenue Project
and the Acapulco Street Project. With respect to the 12th Avenue
Project, Schlessinger was the first point of contact on behalf of CCS with the
homeowner. (AR 1130.) Schlessinger represented that he was the owner/contractor
of CCS. (AR 1129.) Schlessinger negotiated the contract with the homeowner,
provided an estimate for the work, represented that CCS could repair the
homeowner’s bathroom, collected a down payment, and assured the homeowner that
the project would be completed before the homeowner exhausted the
insurance-allocated temporary living expenses. (AR 99, 245, 1130-31.) 
 
            Schlessinger assembled the workers
who worked on the project. (AR 99.) Schlessinger pulled permits for the
project. (AR 814.) When the homeowner discovered that the building department
had issued inspection notices, the homeowner brought such concerns to
Schlessinger. (AR 96.) In response to such concerns, Schlessinger requested
additional progress payments from the homeowner. (AR 99, 246.) Schlessinger
also stopped the project after the homeowner filed a complaint against CCS with
CSLB. (AR 246.)
 
            With respect to the Acapulco Street
Project, Schlessinger represented to the homeowner that he was the company
manager of CCS. (AR 216, 223.) During the small claims action against CCS,
Schlessinger participated in the mediation on behalf of CCS and requested that
the judicial officer include a term in the stipulated judgment that the
homeowner withdraw the CSLB complaint against CCS. (AR 223.) Schlessinger
signed the stipulated judgment on behalf of CCS. (AR 210.) Petitioner himself
admitted to the CSLB investigator and during the administrative hearing that
Schlessinger managed CCS. (AR 1269, 1972.) 

 
            The foregoing evidence demonstrates
that Schlessinger supervised the projects by determining their progression,
including arranging for workers, determining necessary progress payments, and,
in the case of the 12th Avenue Project, stopping the project. Notably,
with respect to the Acapulco Street Project, Schlessinger resolved the small
claims action on behalf of CCS and had authority to enter into and bind CCS to
a Stipulated Judgment.  Such evidence
shows that Schlessinger was more than a “nonsupervising bona fide employee” of
CCS. (Bus. & Prof. Code § 7121.)
 
            Petitioner does not point to any
meaningful evidence to the contrary. 
Rather, petitioner highlights evidence in the record that indicates
petitioner himself was a manager or supervisor. For example, petitioner testified
that he approved the contract over the telephone and had his office use the
rubber stamp of his signature. (AR 1991-92.) Petitioner also testified that worker
Josh Byer sent him photographs of the progress of the work at the 12th
Avenue property and discussed with him changes to the estimate that the
homeowner wanted.[3]
(AR 1942-45.) However, the fact that petitioner was a manager or supervisor at
CCS is not inconsistent with Schlessinger also being a manager or supervisor,
and petitioner otherwise fails to persuade this Court how the record does not
demonstrate Schlessinger was a supervisory employee.  Indeed, it is hard to ignore that, even if
petitioner was a CCS manager or supervisor, as petitioner admitted, the
homeowner for the 12th Avenue Project never dealt with or saw
petitioner (AR 246, 1941-42), which is hardly surprising given the evidence of
Schlessinger’s role as manager and supervisor on that project.  
 
            Petitioner also makes much of the
fact that the ALJ found the work on the 12th Avenue Project “was
performed by employees who were not closely supervised.” (AR 826.) From this,
petitioner jumps to the conclusion that Schlessinger therefore could not have
been a supervisor on the project.  (Reply
at 11-12.)  It does not logically follow
that poor or minimal supervision of the workers means Schlessinger was not a
manager or supervisor.  For the reasons
discussed above, the evidence in the record demonstrates that he was.  Moreover, courts interpreting the applicable
contractor regulations have held that “[p]ersonal presence is not necessary” at
the worksite to demonstrate supervision and control.[4]
(Buzgheia v. Leasco Sierra Grove (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 374, 381, citing G.
E. Hetrick & Associates, Inc. v. Summit Construction & Maintenance Co.
(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 318, 329.)  Thus, to
the extent Schlessinger failed to closely supervise the workers because he was
not often found at the 12th Avenue project does not undermine the
significant countervailing evidence of Schessinger’s role as a manager and
supervisor.
 
            In addition to challenging the evidentiary
basis for the Board’s decision,[5]
petitioner challenges the process employed by the Board, arguing that CSLB was
not empowered to discipline petitioner because the Board’s members were not
present during the hearing before the ALJ and thus were ineligible to vote on
any discipline. (OB at 4.) However, Government Code § 11517(c)(2)(E) clearly
and unambiguously permits the CSLB to reject the decision of the ALJ, stating:
“Within 100 days of receipt by the agency of the administrative law judge’s
proposed decision, . . . [t]he agency may do any of the following: . . . Reject
the proposed decision, and decide the case upon the record.”  (Govt. Code. § 11517(c)(2)(E); see
also Gore v. Board of Medical Quality Assurance (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 184,
190 [“There is no merit in petitioner’s claim that the administrative procedure
prescribed by section 11517(c) of the Government Code is unconstitutional
because it authorizes respondent board to decide the case for itself if the
proposed decision by the administrative judge is not adopted. [¶] The
requirements of due process of law are fully met where, as here, the licensee
was accorded judicial review of the administrative decision in which the court
weighed the evidence and rendered its independent judgment on the merits”].)  That is precisely what happened here,
pursuant to CSLB’s explicit statutory authority to do so.
 
            For the foregoing reasons, with
respect to section 7121, petitioner fails to meet his burden to demonstrate
that the “the administrative findings are contrary to
the weight of the evidence.”  (Fukuda, 20 Cal.4th at 817.)
 
C.          
Increase
in Cost Recovery Order
 
Petitioner
also seeks a review of CSLB’s increase in costs from $12,000 to $14,516. (Pet.
¶ 7; Prayer ¶ 1; cf. AR 828, 920 [difference in costs awarded by ALJ and
CSLB].) Section 125.3 allows the ALJ to “direct a licensee found to have
committed a violation or violations of the licensing act to pay a sum not to
exceed the reasonable costs of the investigation and enforcement of the case.”
(§ 125.3(a).) However, the version of section 125.3 effective at the time of
the CSLB decision stated: “The finding of the administrative law judge with
regard to costs shall not be reviewable by the board to increase the cost
award.” (§ 125.3(d), effective January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021; AR 922
[CSLB decision effective 8/2/21].) 
 
Respondent
CSLB cites Government Code § 11517 and Zuckerman v. State Board of Chiropractic
Examiners (2002) 29 Cal.4th 32 for the proposition that it is authorized to
increase costs to reflect the additional disciplinary finding that petitioner
violated section 7121. (Opp. at 12.) 
 
While
Government Code § 11517 allows CSLB to reject the ALJ’s decision, the statute
does not directly address CSLB’s ability to alter the ALJ’s cost award, unlike
section 125.3, which makes clear and explicit the Board cannot increase the ALJ’s
cost award. “It is a general rule of statutory interpretation that, in the
event of statutory conflict, a specific provision will control over a general
provision.” (Arbuckle-College City Fire Protection Dist. v. County of Colusa
(2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 1155, 1166.) 
 
As
for Zuckerman, that case pertains to 16 C.C.R. § 317.5, concerning the
Board of Chiropractic Examiners, which is silent as whether the Board can increase
an ALJ’s cost award. (Zuckerman, 29 Cal.4th at 36.)  16 C.C.R. § 317.5(c) explicitly allows
the board to “reduce or eliminate the cost award, or remand to the
administrative law judge where the proposed the decision fails to make a
finding on costs,” but it has no provision that expressly permits an increase
to the ALJ’s award of costs.  (16 C.C.R.
§ 317.5(c).)
 
Accordingly,
in light of section 125.3’s express prohibition against increasing a cost award
and respondent’s failure to provide any direct authority to the contrary, the Court
will direct CSLB to amend its adjudicatory decision so that the cost award is
$12,000 as awarded originally by the ALJ. 
 
D.          
Disciplinary
Bond
 
The
ALJ did not impose a disciplinary bond for petitioner to continue to use his
contractor’s license. (Cf. AR 829-30 [ALJ order]; AR 922 [CSLB order
imposing bond].) However, the version of section 7071.8 effective at the time
of its decision allowed CSLB to require a bond as a condition precedent “to the
continued valid use of a license which has been suspended or revoked, but which
suspension or revocation has been stayed.” (§ 7071.8, effective January 1, 2011
to December 31, 2021.) 
 
Petitioner
presents no argument as to why the bond ordered by CSLB constitutes a
prejudicial abuse of discretion under CCP § 1094.5. Moreover, although
petitioner highlighted the difference between the ALJ’s proposed decision and
the CSLB decision with respect to the bond, petitioner did not pray for any
change to the bond. (See Pet. ¶ 7; Prayer ¶ 1.) Accordingly, the Court
does not order any change to the bond. 
 
V.      Conclusion
 
            The
petition for writ of mandate is GRANTED IN PART.  The Court will direct respondent Contractors
State License Board to amend its order so that the cost award will be $12,000
as the Administrative Law Judge ordered. The petition is otherwise DENIED. 
 
Pursuant to Local Rule 3.231(n), petitioner shall
prepare, serve, and ultimately file a proposed judgment and proposed writ of
mandate.
