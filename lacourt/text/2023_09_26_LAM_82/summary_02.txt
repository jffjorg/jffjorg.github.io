## English Summary

This tentative ruling addresses a case involving RENNEKER, who is accused of failing to meet certain supervisory requirements as a licensed contractor.  

The Court finds that the evidence presented to the administrative board is strong enough to support the accusation against RENNEKER, even under the highest standard of proof required in these cases. The Court also clarifies that it is applying the regulations that were in effect at the time the projects in question were undertaken. 


RENNEKER claims to have provided supervisory services, but hasn't provided any evidence to support this claim. The homeowner, who was involved in the projects, testified that he personally saw Schlessinger (another individual involved) bringing workers to the project site and accompanying him to Home Depot to purchase supplies.


The Court finds the homeowner's testimony credible and rejects RENNEKER's argument that the homeowner's statements are inadmissible hearsay.
