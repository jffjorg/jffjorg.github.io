And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the evidence presented and found that the Board's decision was sufficient to meet the higher burden of clear and convincing evidence. The judge notes that the standard of review is inconsequential in this case. The judge also dismisses Petitioner's claim that certain assertions are impermissible hearsay, as they are not out-of-court statements and are based on the homeowner's personal observations.
