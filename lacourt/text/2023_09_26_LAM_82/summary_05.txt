And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on an unopposed application for a writ of possession by Ally Bank, the plaintiff. However, the application has been denied. This is because the plaintiff failed to provide proof of service of the required documents to the defendant, Kichon D. Williams, before the hearing. According to California Code of Civil Procedure section 512.030, the defendant must be served with specific documents, including the summons and complaint, notice of application and hearing, and a copy of the application and any supporting affidavits. Because the plaintiff did not file these proofs of service with the court or attach them to the application, the judge cannot grant the application.

### English Text Summary
The judge has made a tentative ruling in the case of Ally Bank v. Kichon D. Williams, denying the plaintiff's application for a Writ of Possession.

The plaintiff has neither filed any proofs of service with the court nor attached them to the filed document, and therefore the application cannot be granted. The hearing is scheduled for September 26, 2023, at 9:30 AM.
