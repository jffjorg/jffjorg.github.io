And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively denied the unopposed application for a writ of possession filed by Ally Bank, the plaintiff. The reason for this denial is that the plaintiff failed to provide proof of service of the necessary documents to the defendant, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 512.030. Specifically, the plaintiff did not file proof of service with the court or attach it to the filed document. As a result, the application for a writ of possession cannot be granted.
