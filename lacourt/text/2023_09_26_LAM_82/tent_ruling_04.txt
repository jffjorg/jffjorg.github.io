[TENTATIVE] RULING ON VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY
  WRIT OF MANDATE
 
Dept. 82 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)
 
 




 


 


 


 



Petitioner
Nathaniel Helton petitions for writ of mandate directing respondents City of
Los Angeles (“City”) and Kristin M. Crowley, in her official capacity as Fire
Chief, to set aside the termination of petitioner and restore him to his prior
position of Firefighter with back pay.  
 
I.       Factual Background
 
            Petitioner Nathaniel Helton was
employed by the Los Angeles Fire Department (“LAFD”) as a Firefighter. (Helton
Decl. ¶ 1.) 
 
            On August 18, 2021, the Los Angeles
City Council adopted Ordinance No. 187134 (“Ordinance”). (Girard Decl. ¶ 5;
Kepner Decl. ¶ 7.) The Ordinance required City employees to be fully vaccinated
for COVID-19, or to have requested an exemption, and to have reported their
vaccination status no later than October 19, 2021. (Girard Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex.
K; Kepner Decl. ¶ 8; see also Los Angeles Administrative Code [“LAAC”]
4.701(a).) As of October 20, 2021, compliance with the COVID-19 vaccination and
reporting requirements were conditions of employment. (Girard Decl. ¶ 5 &
Ex. K; LAAC § 4.701(b).) 
 
             On October 14, 2021, during negotiations
between the City Administrative Officer and City employee unions, the City
issued its Last, Best, and Final Offer regarding the consequences of failing to
comply with the vaccine mandate (“LBFO”). (Girard Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. L.) Under
the LBFO, employees who had not submitted proof of full vaccination status or a
request for exemption by October 20, 2021 would be issued a Notice of Mandatory
COVID-19 Vaccination Policy Requirements (“Notice”). (Girard Decl. Ex. L at 1.)
Employees who received the Notice were required to sign it and comply with the
terms therein as a condition of employment. (Girard Decl. Ex. L at 2.)
The terms included testing for COVID-19 twice a week with the City or a vendor
chosen by the City, i.e., Bluestone, and deduction of the cost of the testing
from the employee’s paycheck. (Girard Decl. Ex. L at 2; Kepner Decl. ¶
12.) Employees who did not show proof of full compliance by December 18, 2021
would be subject to corrective action. (Girard Decl. Ex. L at 2.)
 
            On October 26, 2021, the City
Council adopted “Resolution Implementing Consequences for Non-Compliance with
the Requirements of Ordinance No. 187134” (“Resolution”). (Girard Decl. ¶ 11
& Ex. A to Ex. N.) Having reached an impasse with City labor organizations
but having found a need to address the threat to public and workplace safety
posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the City Council ordered the Mayor, through
appointing authorities, to implement the LBFO. (Girard Decl. ¶ 11 & Ex. A
to Ex. N.) 
 
            On October 28, 2021, the Mayor
issued a memorandum ordering all department heads to immediately implement the
LBFO and to issue the Notice to each employee who is unvaccinated and has not
requested an exemption. (Gerard Decl. ¶ 11 & Ex. N.) Employees who failed
to report their vaccination status by October 19, 2021 would be treated as
unvaccinated. (Gerard Decl. ¶ 11 & Ex. A to Ex. N.) Upon receiving the
Notice, the employee would have 24-48 hours to review and sign the Notice. (Gerard
Decl. Ex. N at 2-3.) If an employee who had not filed an exemption form refused
to sign the Notice, the employee would be placed off duty without pay pending
service of a Skelly package. (Gerard Decl. Ex. N at 2.) The Mayor’s
memorandum also provided that sworn employees would be subject to applicable
“Board of Rights proceedings.” (Gerard Decl. Ex. N at 2.) 
 
            On December 1, 2021, petitioner
received the Notice. (Helton Decl. ¶ 2 & Ex. C.) On the same date,
petitioner received a “Notice and Order to All Affected Members” dated November
9, 2021 (“Notice and Order”). (Helton Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex. D.) The Notice and
Order indicated that petitioner was not fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and/or
had not reported his vaccination status. (Helton Decl. Ex. D.) The
Notice and Order gave petitioner 48 hours to activate his Bluestone account and
sign the Notice. (Helton Decl. Ex. D at 1.) If petitioner did not
complete the requirements of the Notice and Order within 48 hours of service,
petitioner would be “placed off-duty without pay pending disciplinary review
for failure to meet a condition of employment.” (Helton Decl. Ex. D. at
1.) 
 
            Petitioner
did not sign the Notice. (Helton Decl. ¶ 5.) In refusing to sign the Notice,
petitioner was advised and believed that having to pay for employer-required
testing would violate the California Labor Code. (Helton Decl. ¶ 5.) 
 
            On December 6, 2021, petitioner
received a phone call from his captain stating that he was being placed on
leave without pay. (Helton Decl. ¶ 6; see also Kepner Decl. ¶ 15
[“[B]ecause Petitioner did not comply with the requirement that he been [sic]
vaccinated for COVID-19 and did not indicate that he had begun compliance or
planned to comply, he was placed off-duty without pay effective December 7,
2021 for failure to meet the condition of employment that he be vaccinated for
COVID-19 pending a Board of Rights hearing”].) Petitioner had not requested a
medical or religious exemption. (Kepner Decl. ¶ 15.) Petitioner advised the
Fire Chief by email that he was exercising his right to have the matter
adjudicated by a Board of Rights. (Helton
Decl. ¶ 6.) Petitioner also complained about being placed on unpaid leave
without procedural pre-discipline procedures. (Helton Decl. ¶ 6.)
 
            Petitioner filed an informal
grievance on December 9, 2021 and a formal grievance on December 17, 2021. (Helton
Decl. ¶¶ 7, 9; Kepner Decl. ¶ 18 & Ex. P [formal grievance].) Both
grievances were denied. (Helton Decl. ¶¶ 8, 12.) 
 
            On December 14, 2021, LAFD issued an
“Investigation Notification” to petitioner, which notified petitioner that he
was the subject of an investigation into whether he complied with the
vaccination requirement. (Kepner Decl. ¶ 17 & Ex. O.) Petitioner received
the Investigation Notification on December 30, 2021. (Helton Decl. ¶ 11.)
Petitioner was not interviewed during the investigation. (Helton Decl.
¶ 11.)  
 
            On February 22, 2022, LAFD issued to petitioner a
“Proposed Board of Rights” indicating that the Skelly hearing was
scheduled for March 10, 2022. (Kepner Decl. ¶ 20.) Petitioner’s counsel objected,
indicating that petitioner would not participate in the hearing. (Kepner Decl.
¶ 20 & Ex. Q.) According to petitioner, the objection was based on
respondents’ failure to provide due process under Skelly v. State Personnel
Board (1975) 15 Cal.3d 194. (Helton Decl. ¶ 14.) 
 
            On March 10, 2022, LAFD issued to petitioner a
“Rescheduled Proposed Board of Rights” along with documents upon which the proposed
action was based. (Kepner Decl. ¶ 21 & Ex. R.) The hearing was rescheduled
for April 1, 2022. (Kepner Decl. ¶ 21 & Ex. R.) Petitioner’s counsel
objected based on respondents’ failure to comply with due process. (Helton
Decl. ¶ 15.) Petitioner failed to appear on April 1, 2022. (Kepner Decl. ¶ 22.)

 
            On April 4, 2022, LAFD issued a notice to petitioner
regarding his failure to comply with the vaccine mandate. (Kepner Decl. ¶ 23
& Ex. S.) The documents were served on petitioner’s counsel and the Board
of Fire Commissioners. (Kepner Decl. ¶ 23.) LAFD attempted to serve petitioner
personally with the documents on April 6, 9, 13, 20, 24, and 27, 2022. (Kepner
Decl. ¶ 23.) On May 4, 2022, due to the inability to personally serve
petitioner, LAFD served petitioner by certified mail, in accordance with City
Charter § 1060(d), and regular mail. (Kepner Decl. ¶ 23.) Petitioner
received the notice on May 9, 2022. (Helton Decl. ¶ 16.) 
 
            On May 10, 2022, LAFD issued to petitioner a “Board of
Rights Selection Drawing,” which sought a mutually agreeable date on which the
Chief Officers who would constitute the Board of Rights would be selected. (Kepner
Decl. ¶ 24 & Ex. T.) On May 11, 2022, petitioner’s counsel objected to
convening a Board of Rights and indicated that petitioner would not participate
in the hearing. (Kepner Decl. ¶ 25.) According to petitioner, the objection was
based on respondents’ failure to comply with due process. (Helton Decl. ¶ 17.) 
 
            On May 31, 2022, LAFD issued to petitioner a “Notification
of Board of Rights Hearing,” which specified that the hearing would take place
on June 9, 2022. (Kepner Decl. ¶ 26 & Ex. U.) Petitioner was charged “[f]or
failure to meet a condition of employment as set forth in City of Los Angeles
Ordinance 187134 (effective August 25, 2021), by failing to comply with the
City’s COVID-19 Vaccination Requirement, set forth in the Ordinance and
codified as Section 4.701(a) and (b) of the Los Angeles Administrative Code.” (Kepner
Decl. ¶ 26 & Ex. U.) Petitioner was also advised that he was relieved from
duty as of May 31, 2022. (Kepner Decl. ¶ 26 & Ex. U.) LAFD attempted to
personally serve petitioner with the documents on May 31, 2022 and June 1,
2022. (Kepner Decl. ¶ 26.) On June 1, 2022, when the server encountered
petitioner, petitioner refused to sign and accept the papers. (Kepner Decl. ¶
26 & Ex. U.) On June 1, 2022, LAFD served petitioner and his counsel by
certified mail and regular mail. (Kepner Decl. ¶ 26 & Ex. U.) On June 7,
2022, petitioner’s counsel indicated that petitioner would not appear at the
Board of Rights hearing. (Kepner Decl. ¶ 27.)
 
            On June 9, 2022, petitioner failed to appear at the Board
of Rights. (Kepner Decl. ¶ 28; AR 5:13-14, 6:23-25, 8:19-21, 9:16-18, 10:2-4.) Pursuant
to City Charter § 1060(h), the Fire Chief elected to dissolve the Board of
Rights and remove petitioner from his position. (Kepner Decl. ¶ 31.) The Fire
Chief issued a Notice of Renewal indicating that petitioner was discharged as
of May 31, 2022. (Kepner Decl. ¶¶ 33, 34 & Ex. W.) On June 16, 2022,
petitioner received the notice of his discharge. (Helton Decl. ¶ 19.) 
 
II.      Procedural History
 
             On September 6, 2022, petitioner filed a
Verified Petition for Peremptory Writ of Mandate.       On July 27, 2023, petitioner filed an opening brief. On August
28, 2023, respondents filed an opposition. On September 11, 2023, petitioner
filed a reply. 
 
 
III.     Analysis
 
A.          
Evidentiary
Matters
 
Petitioner’s
request to take judicial notice of Exhibit A, the Statement of Decision in Los
Angeles Police Protective League v. City of Los Angeles et al., LASC Case
No. 21STCV39987 is GRANTED, pursuant to Evidence Code § 452(d).  The Court notes that the rulings of other
trial courts are not binding on this Court. 
 
Petitioner’s
request to take judicial notice of Exhibit B, the Resolution Discontinuing
COVID-19 Surveillance Testing Requirements Implemented Pursuant to Ordinance
No. 187134 is GRANTED, pursuant to Evidence Code § 452(b).
 
Respondents’
requests for judicial notice are DENIED as “unnecessary to the resolution” of
the issues before the Court. (Martinez v. San Diego County Credit Union
(2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 1048, 1075.) The rulings of other trial courts are not
binding on this Court. 
 
B.          
Standard
of Review
 
As
a preliminary matter, in the petition and the opening brief, petitioner invoked
CCP § 1094.5 in seeking administrative mandamus. (Pet. ¶¶ 5-27; OB at 15:5-13.)
However, because petitioner did not appear at the Board of Rights hearing, the
Fire Chief dissolved the Board of Rights. (Kepner Decl. ¶¶ 32, 33.)
Accordingly, there is no adjudicatory decision that is subject to review under
CCP § 1094.5. Accordingly, the Court reviews the petition under CCP § 1085. 
 
CCP
§ 1085(a) provides: “A writ of mandate may be issued by any court to any
inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person, to compel the performance of
an act which the law specially enjoins, as a duty resulting from an office,
trust, or station, or to compel the admission of a party to the use and
enjoyment of a right or office to which the party is entitled, and from which
the party is unlawfully precluded by that inferior tribunal, corporation,
board, or person.”
 
“There
are two essential requirements to the issuance of a traditional writ of
mandate: (1) a clear, present and usually ministerial duty on the part of the
respondent, and (2) a clear, present and beneficial right on the part of the
petitioner to the performance of that duty.” (California Assn. for Health
Services at Home v. State Dept. of Health Services (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
696, 704.) “An action in ordinary mandamus is proper where…the claim is that an
agency has failed to act as required by law.” (Id. at 705.)
 
“When
a party seeks review of an administrative decision pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1085, judicial review is limited to examining the agency
proceedings to ascertain whether the agency's action has been arbitrary,
capricious or lacking entirely in evidentiary support, or whether the agency
failed to follow the proper procedure and give notices required by law. And,
where the case involves the interpretation of a statute or ordinance, our
review of the trial court's decision is de novo.” (Ideal Boat & Camper
Storage v. County of Alameda (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 301, 311, citing Pomona
Police Officers' Assn. v. City of Pomona (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 578, 584.)
In independently reviewing legal questions, “An administrative agency's
interpretation does not bind judicial review but it is entitled to
consideration and respect.” (Housing Partners I, Inc. v. Duncan (2012)
206 Cal.App.4th 1335, 1343.) 
 
An
agency is presumed to have regularly performed its official duties. (Evid. Code
§ 664.) In a CCP § 1085 writ petition, the petitioner generally bears the
burden of proof. (California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. v. State
Personnel Bd. (1995) 10 Cal.4th 1133, 1154.)         
 
C.          
Pre-Discipline
Due Process
 
Petitioner
contends that, instead of being provided with the pre-discipline removal
procedures mandated by Skelly, he was terminated through a phone call. (Reply
at 8:5-13; Helton Decl. ¶ 6.) Respondents respond that petitioner had 48
hours from service on December 1, 2021 of the Notice and Order to All Affected
Members to sign the Notice of Mandatory COVID-19 Vaccination Policy
Requirements. (See Helton Decl. Ex. D.) According to respondents, petitioner
had the opportunity to respond to the Notice by indicating that he was
vaccinated. (Opp. at 14:8-12.) Respondents also argue that petitioner was
notified of the Board of Rights hearing and refused to participate. (Opp. at
14:15-22.)
 
The
Los Angeles City Charter states, in relevant part: 
 
The
right of a member of the Fire Department, except the Fire Chief and any other
member in a position exempt from civil service, to hold his or her office or
position and to receive compensation attached to the office or position is
hereby declared to be a substantial property right of which the holder shall
not be deprived arbitrarily or summarily, nor other than as provided in this
section. No member of the Fire Department shall be suspended, removed, or
otherwise separated from the service of the Fire Department (other than by
resignation), except for good and sufficient cause shown upon a finding of
guilty of the specific charge or charges assigned as cause or causes after a
full, fair and impartial hearing before a Board of Rights except as
provided in subsection (b) and (h) of this section.
 
(City
Charter § 1060(a), emphasis added.) Section 1060(b) of the City Charter allows
the Fire Chief to “temporarily relieve from duty any member pending a hearing
before and decision by a Board of Rights on any charge or charges pending
against the member” “[a]fter following predisciplinary procedures otherwise
required by law.” (Id. § 1060(b).) Section 1060(h) allows the Fire Chief
to suspend or remove the member without a Board of Rights hearing if “the
accused, without reasonable excuse, fails, or refuses to appear before the
Board of Rights at the time and place designated.” (Id. § 1060(h).)
 
Mandatory
pre-removal safeguards for a permanent civil service employee include “notice
of the proposed action, the reasons therefor, a copy of the charges and
materials upon which the action is based, and the right to respond, either
orally or in writing, to the authority initially imposing discipline.” (Skelly
v. State Personnel Bd. (1975) 15 Cal.3d 194, 215.)
 
The
Court finds that petitioner’s right to pre-discipline due process was violated
here. It is true the Notice and Order to All Affected Members, dated November
9, 2021 provides notice of the proposed action, i.e., placement off-duty
without pay pending disciplinary review. (Helton Decl. Ex. D.) It is also true
the Notice and Order also provides the reasons for the action – failure to comply
with the requirement under Ordinance No. 187134 to get vaccinated against
COVID-19 and to report vaccination status. (Helton Decl. Ex. D.) However, no copy
of the charges or materials upon which off-duty placement was based were provided.
(See Helton Decl. Ex. D.) 
 
Perhaps
most importantly, the Notice and Order did not give petitioner the right to
respond to the charges, as required by Skelly. (See also Parker v.
City of Fountain Valley (1981) 127 Cal.App.3d 99, 107 [appellant “given
notice of the charges, a copy of the materials upon which the action was based,
and a right to respond to the charges” but after hearing, Chief of Police “considered
new material, which had not previously been provided to appellant and as to
which appellant had been given no opportunity to respond”].) Instead, the
Notice and Order referred to a previously sent email and provided an email
address if petitioner had questions about submission of documents or activation
of the Bluestone account. (Helton Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex. D.) The Notice and Order
also referred petitioner to the Help Desk if he had been off-duty for an
extended period of time and needed assistance accessing his City email account.
(Helton Decl. Ex. D.) Simply put, the Notice and Order did not provide
petitioner any opportunity to respond to the charges against him.
 
            After work on December 6, 2021,
petitioner received a phone call from his captain placing him on leave without
pay. (Helton Decl. ¶ 6; Kepner Decl. ¶ 7 [petitioner placed off-duty without
pay effective 12/7/21].) At this point, petitioner’s position and compensation
were deprived arbitrarily and summarily, in violation of City Charter §
1060(a). Although section 1060(b) of the City Charter allowed the Fire Chief to
suspend petitioner pending the hearing and decision by the Board of Rights, the
option to suspend is only available “[a]fter following predisciplinary
procedures otherwise required by law.” (City Charter § 1060(b).) Pursuant to Skelly,
such procedures included having a copy of the charges and the materials
upon which the action is based, as well as the right to respond to the charges.
For the reasons stated above, petitioner was not provided these safeguards. 
 
            Respondents argue that petitioner evaded
service and refused to participate in the Skelly proceedings afterward.
(Opp. at 15:17-21.) Even if true, “post-removal safeguards do nothing to
protect the employee who is wrongfully disciplined against the temporary
deprivation of property to which he is subjected pending a hearing.” (Skelly,
15 Cal.3d at 215.) Pre-removal procedural protections “minimize the risk of
error in the initial removal decision.” (Ibid., quoting Arnett v.
Kennedy (1974), 416 U.S. 134, 170.) 
 
Respondents
also point out that the charging documents had to be assembled for 367
firefighters (Opp. at 15:14-17) and that petitioner’s placement off-duty
without pay occurred during an emergency, i.e., the COVID-19 pandemic.
(Opp. at 14:4-7 [“The City’s Skelly process in this emergency situation
satisfied the City’s Skelly obligations pending a more detailed Skelly”].)
Nonetheless, the City Charter did not allow respondents to deprive petitioner of
his position and compensation without the pre-removal safeguards mandated in Skelly.
Furthermore, even if the existence of a pandemic emergency might have justified
immediate placement of petitioner at home off-duty, respondents still had the option
to assign petitioner to home without loss of position and pay until the
pre-removal procedures and the Board of Rights hearing were completed. (Reply
at 9:24-26.)  Respondents did not do so.
 
The
remedy for a Skelly violation is the award of back pay while petitioner
was wrongfully placed off-duty without pay. (Barber v. State Personnel Bd.
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 395, 402.) “[D]amages consist only of back pay for the period
discipline was improperly imposed, i.e., from the date of actual
discipline to the time discipline was validated by the hearing.” (Ibid.)
Accordingly, petitioner is entitled to back pay from December 7, 2021 (the day
his placement off-duty was effective) to June 9, 2021 (the day the Fire Chief
elected to discharge petitioner after he failed to appear at the Board of
Rights). 
 
D.          
Decision
to Terminate Petitioner’s Employment
 
            Petitioner also seeks reinstatement
of his position.  The Court finds he is
not entitled to such relief.
 
Despite
proper notice under City Charter § 1060(d), petitioner failed to appear at the
Board of Rights hearing. (Kepner Decl. ¶¶ 26, 28.) “In general, a party must
exhaust administrative remedies before resorting to the courts.” (Coachella
Valley Mosquito & Vector Control Dist. v. California Public Employment
Relations Bd. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1072, 1080.) The exhaustion doctrine “requires
that a party must not only initially raise the issue in the administrative
forum, but he must proceed through the entire proceeding to a final decision on
the merits of the entire controversy.” (McHugh v. County of Santa Cruz
(1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 533, 539.) “[E]xhaustion of the administrative remedy is a
jurisdictional prerequisite to resort to the courts.” (Abelleira v. District
Court of Appeal, Third Dist. (1941) 17 Cal.2d 280, 293.) “The exhaustion doctrine is
principally grounded on concerns favoring administrative autonomy (i.e.,
courts should not interfere with an agency determination until the agency has
reached a final decision) and judicial efficiency (i.e., overworked courts
should decline to intervene in an administrative dispute unless absolutely
necessary).” (Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th
377, 391.)  Here, by having failed to appear
before the Board of Rights and challenge the disciplinary action against him
and reasons therefor, petitioner failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.
 
             With respect to petitioner’s argument that no
evidence of his guilt was presented at the Board of Rights (OB at 13:1-5), this
was because, under City Charter § 1060(h), the Fire Chief was entitled to
discharge petitioner without the Board of Rights Hearing due to petitioner’s
failure to appear. By failing to appear at the hearing, petitioner may not now
assert that respondents failed to prove that he failed to comply with the
Ordinance at the hearing.  The Fire Chief
was well within her rights to discharge petitioner once he failed to show after
having received proper notice of the Board of Rights hearing.
 
 
IV.     Conclusion
 
For the foregoing reasons, the Petition for Writ of
Mandate is GRANTED IN PART.  Due to the
violation of petitioner’s pre-discipline due process rights, he is entitled to back pay from
December 7, 2021, to June 9, 2021.  The
Petition is otherwise DENIED. 
 
Pursuant to Local Rule 3.231(n), petitioner shall
prepare, serve, and ultimately file a proposed judgment and proposed writ of
mandate.
