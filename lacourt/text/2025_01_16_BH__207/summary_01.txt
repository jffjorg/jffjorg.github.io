```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to dissolve the stay of action in the case, which was put in place pending the outcome of a related quiet title case. The plaintiff argued that lifting the stay was warranted due to changed circumstances, specifically the filing of a cross-complaint in the quiet title action that alleged the foreclosure sale was wrongful and invalid. However, the judge did not read a specific admission into the defendant's general denial of the cross-complaint, and further noted that the quiet title action is still not yet resolved. As the stay is still in place pending the outcome of the quiet title case, the judge has denied the motion to dissolve the stay.
