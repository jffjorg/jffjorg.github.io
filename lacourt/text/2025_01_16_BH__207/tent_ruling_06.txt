[1] “Although [a court] may not rely on unpublished
California cases, the California Rules of Court do not prohibit citation to
unpublished federal cases, which may properly be cited as persuasive, although
not binding, authority.”  (Landmark
Screens, LLC v. Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, LLP (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th
238, 251, fn. 6, citing in part Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.1115.)  Here, the Court does not find the federal
cases to be persuasive.   


[2] Ultimate facts are those “constituting the cause of
action” or those upon which liability depends, e.g., duty of care, breach of
the duty and causation (damages).  (See
Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.)  “[T]he term ultimate fact generally refers to
a core fact, such as an essential element of a claim. Ultimate facts are
distinguished from evidentiary facts and from legal conclusions.”  (Central Valley General Hosp. v. Smith
(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 501, 513 [cleaned up]; see also Rodriguez v. Parivar,
Inc. (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 739, 750–751 [“The elements of a cause of action
constitute the essential or ultimate facts in a civil case”].)
