MATTER


Request for Default Judgment



 
This case arises from allegations
of a commercial lease dispute.  Plaintiff
Westwood Village Properties, LLC (“Plaintiff”) requests for default judgment
against Defendants Primo’s Donuts, LLC; Ralph Primo; Ralph Primo Jr.; and Celia
Primo (“Defendants”) in the amount of $465,616.95, which is
composed of special damages as demanded in the Complaint in the amount of $450,616.95;
costs in the amount of $435; and attorneys’ fees in the amount of $14,565.
 
A.   
Damages
 
            Plaintiff’s Complaint alleges two causes of action for
(1) breach of contract and (2) enforcement of guaranty.  Celia Primo was personally served with a copy
of the summons and complaint on July 5, 2024. 
Ralph Primo; Ralph Primo Jr.; and Primo’s Donuts were served by
substitute service on July 11, 2024. 
Default was entered against Defendants on August 27, 2024.  There are no Doe defendants.  
 
            Plaintiff’s Complaint seeks $450,616.95
in past due rent, operating expenses, late fees, interest, legal fees, and
indemnification under the lease. (See Compl.)  Therefore, Plaintiff does not seek damages
that are in excess of what is pled in the Complaint. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
580, subd. (a) [“The relief granted to the plaintiff, if there is no answer,
cannot exceed that demanded in the complaint”]; Levine v. Smith (2006)
145 Cal.App.4th 1131, 1136-1137 [“when recovering damages in a default
judgment, the plaintiff is limited to the damages specified in the complaint”].)  
 
            In support
of the request, Plaintiff has provided the Declaration of Seth Bell, which
authenticates the lease and lease addendum attached as Exhibits 1 and 2 to the
Complaint, which is signed by Ralph Primo, Jr. on behalf of Primo’s Donuts,
LLC.  Incorporated in the lease is a
guaranty signed by Ralph Primo and Celia Primo.
 
            The lease
addendum provides for minimum monthly rent as follows:
 
10948 Weyburn Ave
Period                                                 Minimum Rent                       Monthly Minimum Rent
1/1/2021-12/31/2021                          $127,200.00                            $10,600.00
1/1/2022-12/31/2022                          $131,016.00                            $10,918.00
1/1/2023-12/31/2023                          $134,946.48                            $11,245.54
1/1/2024-12/31/2024                          $138,994.87                            $11,582.91
1/1/2025-12/31/2025                          $143,164.72                            $11,930.39
 
1006 Broxton Ave (the “Expanded Premises”)
Period                                                 Minimum
Rent                       Monthly
Minimum Rent
Months 1-12                                       $55,200.00                              $4,600.00
Months 13-24                                     $56,856.00                              $4,738.00
Months 25-36                                     $58,561.68                              $4,880.14
Months 37-48                                     $60,318.53                              $5,026.54
 
            Plaintiff
was also obligated to pay Operating Costs for the Expanded Premises.
 
            The Bell
declaration also authenticates the ledger of outstanding payments owed,
attached to the Complaint as Exhibit 3. 
The ledger outlines $196,127.75 in outstanding rent, late fees, and
interest, as of March 31, 2024.
 
            In
addition, the Bell declaration indicates that a December 2023 lawsuit was filed
against Primo’s, requiring Plaintiff to pay $5,500 to resolve the claim arising
out of Primo’s alleged violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act, for which
Plaintiff is entitled reimbursement, pursuant to Section 8.1 of the lease.
 
            Plaintiff
seeks $465,616.95, yet Plaintiff has only substantiated $196,127.75 + $5,500 =
$201,627.75.  
 
            Therefore,
Plaintiff has not demonstrated entitlement to the entire amount in requested
damages.  
 
B.   
Attorneys’ Fees and
Costs
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, which outlines recoverable costs
to a prevailing party under Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, permits the
recovery of attorneys’ fees when authorized by contract, statute, or law.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.
(a)(10).)  Code of Civil Procedure
section 1021 provides “[e]xcept as attorney’s fees are specifically provided
for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and
counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the parties
[….]”  Similarly, Civil Code section 1717
provides “[i]n any action on a contract, where the contract specifically
provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that
contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing
party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the
contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not,
shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees in addition to other
costs.”  (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a).)
 
The Code of Civil Procedure defines
the “prevailing party” as follows: 
 
[T]he party with a net monetary
recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where
neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against
those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant. If any
party recovers other than monetary relief and in situations other than as
specified, the “prevailing party” shall be as determined by the court, and
under those circumstances, the court, in its discretion, may allow costs or not
and, if allowed, may apportion costs between the parties on the same or adverse
sides pursuant to rules adopted under Section 1034.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)   Section 14.1 of the Lease provides:
 
Except as otherwise set forth 1n the
Lease, in litigation or other legal proceeding between Landlord and Tenant, the
cause for which arises out of or in relation to this Lease, the prevailing
party shall be entitled to receive its actual costs, expenses and reasonable
attorneys’ fees from the non-prevailing party as the same may be awarded by the
court, including costs of appeal, which costs, expenses, and attorney’s fees
shall not exceed fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00) in the aggregate,
excepting that if either party files for bankruptcy protection, then there
shall be no cap.
 
            Plaintiff
requests exactly $15,000 in attorneys’ fees and costs combined.  Although Plaintiff is generally entitled to
its reasonable attorneys’ fees, Plaintiff has not provided any evidentiary
support indicating that it incurred $14,565 in attorneys’ fees.  
            
            As for costs, Plaintiff also
requests its $435 filing fee.  (CIV-100.) Plaintiff’s request
for costs may be granted if Plaintiff is to be considered the prevailing party
in this action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is denied
because Plaintiff has not sufficiently substantiated its request for damages or
attorneys’ fees.  
 
            Accordingly, the Court continues the Order to Show Cause
re Entry of Default Judgment to March 27, 2025 at 8:30 A.M. in Department
207.  The Court also orders Plaintiff to
file an amended Request for Entry of Default Judgment in conformity with the
Court’s ruling on or before March 7, 2025.
