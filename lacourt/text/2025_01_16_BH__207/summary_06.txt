And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is issuing a tentative ruling based on the information presented before today. The court notes that while unpublished California cases may not be relied upon, unpublished federal cases may be cited as persuasive authority, although not binding. However, the court does not find these federal cases to be persuasive. The court defines "ultimate facts" as those that constitute the cause of action or upon which liability depends, such as duty of care, breach of duty, and causation. The court will consider these ultimate facts in its decision.
