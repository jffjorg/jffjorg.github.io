MOTION
 
This case arises over a dispute concerning the foreclosure of Plaintiff
Maya Grushansky’s (“Plaintiff”) real property. 
On September 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed suit against Defendants FCI Lender
Services, Inc. (“FCI”) and Coastal Capital Group, LLC (“Coastal”) (together,
“Defendants”) alleging five causes of action for (1) Violation of Civil Code
section 2923.5; (2) Violation of Civil Code section 2924.9; (3) Wrongful
Foreclosure: (4) Unfair Business Practices; and (5) Cancellation of Written
Instruments.  
 
Defendants now demur to all five causes of action on the grounds that
they fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action under Code
of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (e).
 
Plaintiff opposes the demurrer and Defendants reply.

Courts can take judicial
notice of the existence and recordation of real property records, including
deeds, if authenticity is not reasonably disputed.  (Fontenot v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
(2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 256, 264-265.) 
“The official act of recordation and the common use of a notary public
in the execution of such documents assure their reliability, and the
maintenance of the documents in the recorder’s office makes their existence and
text capable of ready confirmation, thereby placing such documents beyond
reasonable dispute.”  (Ibid.)  Moreover, courts can take judicial notice not
only of the existence and recordation of recorded documents but also matters
that can be deduced from the documents, including the parties, dates, and legal
consequences of recorded documents relating to real estate transactions.  (Ibid.)  
 
Therefore, the Court takes
judicial notice of the requested exhibits.
 
ANALYSIS
 
1.     DEMURRER
 
“It is black letter law that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of
the allegations in a complaint.”  (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015)
235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  In testing the sufficiency of a cause of
action, a court accepts “[a]s true all material facts properly pled and matters
which may be judicially noticed but disregard contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.  [A court
also gives] the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole
and its parts in their context.”  (290
Division (EAT), LLC v. City & County of San Francisco (2022) 86
Cal.App.5th 439, 450 [cleaned up]; Hacker v. Homeward Residential, Inc. (2018)
26 Cal.App.5th 270, 280 [“in considering the merits of a demurrer, however,
“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable
they may be”].)
 
Further, in ruling on a demurrer, a court must “liberally construe”
the allegations of the complaint “with a view to substantial justice between
the parties.”  (See Code Civ. Proc., §
452.)  “This rule of liberal construction
means that the reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not
the defendant.”  (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.)   
 
In summary, “[d]etermining whether the complaint is sufficient as
against the demurrer on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action, the rule is that if on consideration of all the
facts stated it appears the plaintiff is entitled to any relief at the hands of
the court against the defendants the complaint will be held good although the
facts may not be clearly stated, or may be intermingled with a statement of
other facts irrelevant to the cause of action shown, or although the plaintiff
may demand relief to which he is not entitled under the facts alleged.”  (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193
Cal.App.2d 636, 639.)
 
A.   
FAILURE TO STATE A CAUSE OF ACTION
 
                                                        
i.         
First and
Second Causes of Action – based on the Homeowner’s Bill of Rights (“HBOR”)
 
Plaintiff’s first two causes of action allege violations of Civil Code
sections 2923.5 and 2924.9, both of which are part of the “Homeowner’s Bill of
Rights” or “HBOR” which is “a complex set of enactments focused specifically on
residential mortgages and passed as a legislative response to the ongoing
mortgage foreclosure crisis in 2012.”  (Morris
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2022) 78 Cal.App.5th 279, 295.)  The HBOR encompasses Civil Code sections
2920.5, 2923.4–2923.7, 2924, 2924.9–2924.12, 2924.15, and 2924.17–2924.20.  (Ibid.)
 
Section 2923.5 requires:
 
(a) (1) A mortgage servicer, mortgagee, trustee,
beneficiary, or authorized agent shall not record a notice of default pursuant
to Section 2924 until both of the following:
 
(A) Either 30 days after initial contact is made
as required by paragraph (2) or 30 days after satisfying the due diligence
requirements as described in subdivision (e).
 
(B) The mortgage servicer complies with paragraph
(1) of subdivision (a) of Section 2924.18, if the borrower has provided a
complete application as defined in subdivision (d) of Section 2924.18.
 
(2) A mortgage servicer shall contact the
borrower in person or by telephone in order to assess the borrower’s financial
situation and explore options for the borrower to avoid foreclosure. During the
initial contact, the mortgage servicer shall advise the borrower that he or she
has the right to request a subsequent meeting and, if requested, the mortgage
servicer shall schedule the meeting to occur within 14 days. The assessment of
the borrower’s financial situation and discussion of options may occur during
the first contact, or at the subsequent meeting scheduled for that purpose. In
either case, the borrower shall be provided the toll-free telephone number made
available by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) to find a HUD-certified housing counseling agency. Any meeting may occur
telephonically.
 
[…]
 
(f) This section shall apply only to mortgages or
deeds of trust described in Section 2924.15.
 
(g) This section shall apply only to entities
described in subdivision (b) of Section 2924.18
 
Section 2924.9 provides:
 
(a) Unless a borrower has previously exhausted
the first lien loan modification process offered by, or through, his or her
mortgage servicer described in Section 2923.6, within five business days after
recording a notice of default pursuant to Section 2924, a mortgage servicer that
offers one or more foreclosure prevention alternatives shall send a written
communication to the borrower that includes all of the following information:
 
(1) That the borrower may be evaluated for a
foreclosure prevention alternative or, if applicable, foreclosure prevention
alternatives.
 
(2) Whether an application is required to be
submitted by the borrower in order to be considered for a foreclosure
prevention alternative.
 
(3) The means and process by which a borrower may
obtain an application for a foreclosure prevention alternative.
 
(b) This section shall not apply to entities
described in subdivision (b) of Section 2924.18.
 
(c) This section shall apply only to mortgages or
deeds of trust described in Section 2924.15.
 
Section 2924.15 provides that these subdivisions “shall apply only to
a first lien mortgage or deed of trust that is secured by owner-occupied
residential real property containing no more than four dwelling units.”  (Civ. Code, § 2924.15, subd. (a).)  The statute defines “owner-occupied” as
meaning “that the property is the principal residence of the borrower and is
security for a loan made for personal, family, or household purposes.”  (Civ. Code., § 2924.15, subd. (b).)
 
Defendants first argue that Plaintiff fails to allege facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action for violations of the HBOR, because the loan
secured by the deed of trust upon which the lender foreclosed on was a
commercial loan for an investment property. 
In support, Defendants point to paragraph 17 of the Complaint, which
indicates, “You can only this type of loan for business purposes, and not
personal purposes.”  (Complaint ¶ 17
[sic].)
 
Because the grammar of this sentence does not make sense, there
appears to be at least one typographical error contained in paragraph 17.  In context, the Complaint alleges as follows:
 
15. On February 22, 2024, CCG DEFENDANT recorded
the new loan, and it is in first position. This loan must follow the HBOR
rules. The money was not used for any business purposes as PLAINTIFF is a care
provider to her mother. She gets a W-2 from the State of California. 
 
16. The Notice of Default as stated was recorded
on March 6, 2024. This loan became due in full on March 1, 2024. The Notice of
Default declaration was signed was February 23, 2024 before the loan became
fully due. It states the homeowner bill of rights statutes do not apply to this
loan. However, this is a first deed of trust and owner occupied. 
 
17. This loan was not applied for business
purposes. You can only this type of loan for business purposes, and not
personal purposes. 
 
18. The Notice of Default declaration is faulty.
If the note became due March 1, 2024, PLAINTIFF would have to be delinquent 120
days before the Notice of Default and wait 90 days before they can record a
Notice of Trustee Sale. There was no acceleration clause in the Notice of
Default, and it would need to be. 
 
19. Since this loan is defined under HBOR, this
is a first lien mortgage and must comply with the alternatives to foreclosure.
The client stated that they did not offer any assistance or modification as
they stated it was a business loan. This is her primary residence.
 
(Complaint
¶¶ 15-19.)  Thus, notwithstanding the
typographical errors in paragraph 17, Plaintiff has adequately alleged that the
loan in question was not a commercial or business loan, and the real property
in question was Plaintiff’s primary residence. 
Whether the loan was in fact a commercial or business loan, and
whether the property was in fact Plaintiff’s primary residence are
factual questions to be determined at later stages of the litigation.
 
            Defendants also argue that the first
two causes of action fail because (1) the foreclosure has already occurred and
(2) Plaintiff has not alleged that she was prejudiced.  
 
As for Defendants’ first argument, Civil Code section 2924.12
provides:
 
(a) (1) If a trustee’s deed upon sale has not
been recorded, a borrower may bring an action for injunctive relief to enjoin a
material violation […]
 
(b)  After
a trustee’s deed upon sale has been recorded, a mortgage servicer, mortgagee,
trustee, beneficiary, or authorized agent shall be liable to a  borrower for actual economic damages […]
 
            The Complaint alleges:
 
24. PLAINTIFF requests an injunction and damages.
 
[…]
 
29. PLAINTIFF is entitled to an injunction prior
to foreclosure, or civil and statutory penalties post-foreclosure against FCI
DEFENDANT and CCG DEFENDANT in an amount to be proven at trial.
 
(Complaint
¶¶ 24, 29.)  Thus, that the foreclosure
sale has already occurred is not grounds to sustain Defendant’s demurrer to the
first or second causes of action.
 
As for Defendants’ second argument, the only case law Defendants cite
in support of the argument that Plaintiff must allege prejudice are non-binding
unpublished federal district court cases.[1] 
 
Therefore, the Court overrules Defendants’ demurrer to the first and
second causes of action.
 
                                                      
ii.         
Third Cause
of Action – Wrongful Foreclosure
 
“The basic elements of a tort
cause of action for wrongful foreclosure […] are: (1) the trustee or mortgagee
caused an illegal, fraudulent, or willfully oppressive sale of real property
pursuant to a power of sale in a mortgage or deed of trust; (2) the party
attacking the sale (usually but not always the trustor or mortgagor) was
prejudiced or harmed; and (3) in cases where the trustor or mortgagor
challenges the sale, the trustor or mortgagor tendered the amount of the
secured indebtedness or was excused from tendering.”  (Miles v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co.
(2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 394, 408.)
 
Defendants reiterate their
arguments above that violations of the HOBR cannot form the basis of a wrongful
foreclosure action because the HOBR does not apply as this was a business
purpose loan recorded on property that was not owner-occupied or Plaintiff’s
principal residence.  As discussed above,
because these are adequately pleaded and ultimately factual issues to be
determined at later stages of the litigation, the Court similarly rejects these
arguments as a basis to sustain a demurrer to the third cause of action.
 
Defendants also argue that the
third cause of action fails because Plaintiff did not allege tender.  However, the Complaint alleges, “34.
PLAINTIFF is excused from the tender requirement because of FCI DEFENDANT and
CCG DEFENDANT’s violations of Civ. Code §§2923.5 and 2924.9.”  (Complaint ¶ 34.)  At the pleadings stage, this satisfies the
third “tender” element of a wrongful foreclosure cause of action. 
 
Finally, Defendants argue that
Plaintiff failed to allege prejudice. 
The Complaint alleges:
 
31. On July 9, 2024, FCI DEFENDANT and CCG
DEFENDANT wrongfully foreclosed on the Subject Property based upon violations
of Civ. Code §§2923.5 and 2924.9. 
 
32. FCI DEFENDANT and CCG DEFENDANT caused an
illegal, fraudulent, or willfully oppressive sale of the Subject Property
pursuant to a power of sale in a mortgage or deed of trust. 
 
33. PLAINTIFF suffered prejudice or harm as a
result of the wrongful foreclosure trustee sale.
 
[…]
 
35. PLAINTIFF is entitled to monetary damages for
the loss of the Subject Property and her investment in it. 
 
36. PLAINTIFF is entitled to have the wrongful
foreclosure vacated, and have the Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale, Notice of Default
and Notice of Trustee’s Sale cancelled.
 
(Complaint
­­¶¶ 31-33; 35-36.)  This is sufficient
to allege prejudice at the pleadings stage. 
Whether Plaintiff was actually prejudiced by the foreclosure sale is a
factual question to be determined at later stages of the litigation.
 
            Therefore, the Court overrules
Defendants’ demurrer to the third cause of action for wrongful foreclosure.
 
                                                    
iii.         
Fourth Cause
of Action – Unfair Business Practices
 
Business and Professions Code section 17200, known as the Unfair
Competition Law, or “UCL,” bars unfair competition, defined as “any unlawful,
unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or
misleading advertising and any act prohibited by Chapter 1 (commencing with
Section 17500) of Part 3 of Division 7 of the Business and Professions
Code.  “An ‘unlawful’ business practice
or act within the meaning of the UCL is an act or practice, committed pursuant
to business activity, that is at the same time forbidden by law.”  (Bernardo v. Planned Parenthood Federation
of Am. (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 322, 351.) 
“By proscribing ‘any unlawful’ business practice, section 17200 borrows
violations of other laws and treats them as unlawful practices that the unfair
competition law makes independently actionable.”  (Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los
Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 180.)  Moreover, “a practice may be deemed unfair
even if not specifically proscribed by some other law.”  (Ibid.)
 
In order to have standing to
bring a UCL claim, a plaintiff must “(1) establish a loss or deprivation of
money or property sufficient to qualify as injury in fact, i.e., economic
injury, and (2) show that that economic injury was the result of, i.e., caused
by, the unfair business practice or false advertising that is the gravamen of
the claim.”  (Kwikset Corp. v.
Superior Court (2011) 51 Cal.4th 310, 322.)
 
Defendants argue that the UCL
claim fails because Plaintiff does not allege any unfair, unlawful, or
fraudulent business practices and Plaintiff does not allege an injury-in-fact
for purposes of standing.
 
Because the Court overrules
Defendants’ demurrer to the first two causes of action, Plaintiff adequately
alleges unlawful conduct upon which to base the UCL cause of action.
 
As for standing, Plaintiff alleges:
 
41. PLAINTIFF alleges that FCI DEFENDANT and CCG
DEFENDANT violated the “unfair,” “unlawful,” and “fraudulent” prongs of the UCL
resulting in injury and economic loss to PLAINTIFF […]
 
45. PLAINTIFF has suffered an actual, pecuniary
injury of the loss of the equity in the value of the Subject Property, and the
costs of seeking a remedy for FCI DEFENDANT and CCG DEFENDANT’s wrongful
actions.
 
[…]
 
47. PLAINTIFF demand restitution, and that FCI
DEFENDANT and CCG DEFENDANT disgorge their illicit profits and that PLAINTIFF
receive all monetary awards statutorily due to them.
 
(Complaint
¶¶ 41, 45, 47.)  Thus, Plaintiff has
adequately alleged pecuniary harm sufficient to establish standing to bring a
UCL claim.
 
            Therefore, the Court overrules
Defendants’ demurrer to the fourth cause of action.  
 
                                                    
iv.         
Fifth Cause
of Action – Cancellation of Written Instruments
 
Under
Civil Code section 3412, a written instrument, in respect to which there is a
reasonable apprehension that if left outstanding it may cause serious injury to
a person against whom it is void or voidable, may, upon his application, be so
adjudged, and ordered to be delivered up or canceled.
 
To
prevail on a claim to cancel an instrument, a plaintiff must prove (1) the
instrument is void or voidable due to, for example, fraud; and (2) there is a
reasonable apprehension of serious injury including pecuniary loss or the
prejudicial alteration of one's position.
 
(Thompson v. Ioane (2017) 11
Cal.App.5th 1180, 1193–1194 [cleaned up].)
 
            Defendants
argue that Plaintiff’s allegations are too conclusory.  Here, in addition to the above allegations,
Plaintiff alleges:
 
49. The Notice of Default declaration is faulty.
If the note became due March 1, 2024, PLAINTIFF would have to be delinquent 120
days before the Notice of Default and wait 90 days before they can record a
Notice of Trustee Sale. There was no acceleration clause in the Notice of
Default, and it would need to be. This renders the Notice of Default and Notice
of Trustee’s Sale as void instruments pursuant to Civ. Code §2924(a)(6). 
 
50. PLAINTIFF has a reasonable belief that the
Notice of Default, instrument no. 2024- 0081088 and Notice of Trustee’s Sale,
instrument no. 20240381884 and Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale are voidable or void ab
initio. (Exhibits “C” and “D”) 
 
51. PLAINTIFF has a reasonable apprehension that
if these voidable or void ab initio recorded written instruments is/are left
outstanding, it/they may cause serious injury to PLAINTIFF because of their
violations of Civ. Code §§2923.5 and 2924.9. 
 
52. PLAINTIFF seeks to cancel the hereinabove
written instruments pursuant to Civ. Code §3412 due to them being voidable or
void, clouds on title and wrongfully recorded.
 
(Complaint
¶¶ 49-52.)
 
            Thus, Plaintiff has sufficiently
alleged “ultimate facts” to state a cause of action for cancellation of written
instruments.[2]
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
For the reasons stated, the Court overrules Defendants’ demurrer to
Plaintiff’s Complaint in its entirety.  
 
Further, the Court orders Defendants to file an Answer to the Complaint
on or before February 7, 2025.  
 
Defendants shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file the
notice with a proof of service forthwith.
