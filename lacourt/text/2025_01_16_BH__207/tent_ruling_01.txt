MOTION
 
            On July 13, 2022, Plaintiff Sam
Ostayan (“Plaintiff”) filed the unlawful detainer complaint in this
action.  On December 14, 2022, the Court
stayed this action pending the outcome of the related quiet title case, Siregar
v. Ostayan, case number 22SMCV02460. 
(See Minute Order, Dec. 14, 2022.) 

 
            Plaintiff now moves to dissolve the
stay.  Defendant Joan Rebecca Siregar
(“Defendant”) opposes the motion and Plaintiff replies.
 
ANALYSIS
 
            Plaintiff moves to dissolve the stay
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 128, subdivision (a)(8), which
provides courts with the power to “amend and control its process and orders so
as to make them conform to law and justice[.]”    
 
            Specifically, Plaintiff argues that
lifting the stay is warranted on the basis of changed circumstances because
Plaintiff filed a cross-complaint in the quiet title action, alleging that the
foreclosure sale was wrongful and the sale was invalid, to which Defendant
answered by way of a general denial, effectively conceding her contrary
position in that case, upon which the stay in this case is premised.
 
            The Court does not read such a
specific admission into Defendant’s general denial.  Further, even if Defendant had so conceded,
the quiet title action is still not yet resolved.  This case is stayed “pending the outcome of
22SMCV02460.”  (Minute Order, Dec. 14,
2022.)  Because that case has not yet
reached an outcome, lifting the stay in this case is not yet warranted.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, the Court denies
Plaintiff’s motion to dissolve the stay. 

 
Plaintiff shall provide notice
of the Court’s ruling and file the notice with a proof of service.
