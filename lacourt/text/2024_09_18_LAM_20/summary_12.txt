And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where Plaintiffs are seeking damages. The Judge notes that the Plaintiffs' complaint only references $448,554.27 in damages, but the Plaintiffs are also seeking additional damages of $323,927.27 and $647,927.54. The Judge rules that the relief granted to the Plaintiffs cannot exceed what was demanded in the complaint, as per Code of Civil Procedure § 580. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiffs failed to serve a statement of damages and that phrases such as "in an amount not less than" do not provide sufficient notice for the purposes of Code of Civil Procedure § 580. As a result, the Judge denies the Default Judgment Application without prejudice and orders the Plaintiffs to either accept the damages of $448,554.27 or amend their allegations as to damages, which would be a material change opening the door for the Defendants to respond.
