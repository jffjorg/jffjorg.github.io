And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the business record subpoenas issued by the defendants to the plaintiff's physicians and has found that they infringe on the plaintiff's privacy rights. The subpoenas seek a wide range of documents, including medical records, test results, and other writings, and the court has concluded that they are not sufficiently relevant to the wage and hour dispute at issue. The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to quash the subpoenas and has declined to award sanctions. The defendants are ordered to provide notice of the court's decision.
