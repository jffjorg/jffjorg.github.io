While Plaintiffs request $323,927.27 and $647,927.54 in damages, the FAC only references $448,554.27.  This is problematic as “[t]he relief granted to the plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot exceed that demanded in the complaint . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 580.)  Further, phrases such as “in an amount not less than” do not give notice for the purposes of Code Civ. Proc. § 580.  (Electronic Funds Solutions, LLC v. Murphy (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173-1174.)  Code Civ. Proc. § 580 applies even when a defendant has defaulted after having filed an answer and having participated in discovery.  (See Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 828; Elec. Funds Sols., LLC v. Murphy (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1175.)  Further, a statement of damages was not served. Thus, Plaintiffs can either accept $448,554.27 in damages or else amend the FAC’s allegations as to damages, which would be a material change opening Defendants’ default.  (Cole v. Roebling Const. Co. (1909) 156 Cal. 443; Leo v. Dunlap (1968) 260 Cal.App.2d 24, 27-28.) Accordingly, the Default Judgment Application is denied without prejudice. Plaintiffs to give notice.
