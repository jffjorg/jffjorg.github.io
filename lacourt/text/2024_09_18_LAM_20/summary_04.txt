And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in an employment action brought by Victoria White against Service All-Stars Energy, Inc. and Faisal Lodhi. The Court granted motions by Ms. White to compel initial responses to her discovery requests on December 8, 2024, and February 14, 2024. However, the Defendants failed to provide responses, prompting Ms. White to seek sanctions for misuse of the discovery process. The Judge has granted the motion and awarded issue sanctions as requested, but declined to award monetary sanctions. The Court finds that the Defendants' failure to participate in the discovery process constitutes a misuse of the discovery process, and notes that the trial court should consider both the conduct being sanctioned and its effect on the party seeking discovery when selecting an appropriate sanction.
