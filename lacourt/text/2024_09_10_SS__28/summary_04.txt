And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is sustaining the demurrers filed by H&D Gateway LLC and Golden Lyon Investment Co. dba W.Y. International, Inc. to the second cause of action in the third amended complaint filed by Plaintiff Jorge Luis Mata Hernandez. The second cause of action alleges ratification of assault under Labor Code section 3602, subdivision (b)(1).

The judge finds that the complaint does not allege facts showing that H&D or Golden Lyon ratified Cortes Leon's alleged positive misconduct. The complaint alleges that Cortes Leon was the supervisor of his own workers, but does not allege facts showing that Cortes Leon was acting on behalf of H&D or Golden Lyon when he allegedly harbored Rivera Garcia. The judge concludes that H&D and Golden Lyon cannot be liable as joint participants with Cortes Leon.

The judge sustains the demurrers without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff will not be allowed to refile the complaint with additional allegations.
