C.   The Court relates and consolidates the cases 
On

are related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a).  22STCV25064 became the lead case.  The cases were assigned to Department 31 at the
Spring Street Courthouse for all purposes. 
On
December 4, 2023, the Court ordered cases numbers 22CHCV01241 and 22STCV25064
consolidated and assigned to Department 31 in the Spring Street Courthouse for
all purposes based on the parties’ stipulation.  The Court designated case number 22STCV25064
as the lead case. 
D.   These motions 
On
March 6, 2024, Lemus filed motions (1) to compel Magali Manzanares’s further
responses to request for production of documents, set one, and for sanctions,

responses to request for production of documents, set one, and for sanctions, and
(4) to compel Richard Manzanares’s further responses to requests for admission,
set one, and for sanctions.  The motions initially
were set for hearing on May 16 and 17, 2024. 
On April 30, 2024, Magali Manzanares and Richard Manzanares filed
oppositions.  Lemus did not file replies.
In
June 2024, the Court transferred the consolidated cases to Department 28.  The Court continued the hearings on the
motions to compel further responses to September 10, 2024. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for November 4, 2024. 
DISCUSSION
  On
July 17, 2023, Lemus filed four motions to compel further responses in case number 22CHCV01241, before that case was related
and consolidated with case number 22STCV25064. 
The July 17, 2023 motions appear to be the same as the motions to compel
further responses (currently at issue) which Lemus filed on March 6, 2024 in
the consolidated cases.  The motions
filed on July 17, 2023 in case number 22CHCV01241 were set for hearing in Department
F47 in the Chatsworth Courthouse in November 2023. 
On
October 25, 2023, when the Court related case numbers 22CHCV01241 and
22STCV25064, the Court stated: “Any presently calendared motions in cases other
than the lead case [i.e., in case number 22CHCV01241] will need to be
re-noticed and re-scheduled through the Court’s online reservation system to
the next available date in Department 31, by the moving party.” 
On
November 13, 2023, Department F47 in the Chatsworth Courthouse issued an order stating in part: 
“On the Court's own motion, the Hearing on Motion to
Compel Further Discovery Responses to Requests for Production, Set No. One as
to Defendant Magali Manzanares scheduled for 11/14/2023, . . . Hearing on
Motion to Compel Further Discovery Responses to Requests for Admission, Set No.
One as to Defendant Richard Manzanares scheduled for 11/14/2023, Hearing on
Motion to Compel Further Discovery Responses to Requests for Production, Set
No. One as to Defendant Richard Manzanares scheduled for 11/14/2023, and Hearing
on Motion to Compel Further Discovery Responses to Requests for Admission, Set
No. One as to Defendant Magali Manzanares scheduled for 11/14/2023 are vacated.” 
          Accordingly, the Court informed Lemus on October 25, 2023
that if he wished to proceed on the July 17, 2023 motions to compel further responses, he
would have to re-notice and re-schedule the hearings in Department 31.  The Court reiterated this information on
November 13, 2023. 
Nonetheless,
Lemus did not re-notice and re-schedule hearings on his motions to compel further discovery responses in
Department 31 until March 6, 2024, more than four months after the October 25, 2023 order.  Lemus
has provided no explanation for his delay. 
The
Court finds that Lemus has waived or abandoned his right to proceed with these
motions.  The Court therefore denies the motions. 
CONCLUSION 
          The Court DENIES Plaintiff
Rolando Lemus’s motion to compel Defendant Magali Manzanares’s further
responses to request for production of documents, set one, and for sanctions. 
          The Court DENIES Plaintiff Rolando
Lemus’s motion to compel Defendant Magali Manzanares’s further responses to
requests for admission, set one, and for sanctions.

Defendant Richard Manzanares’s further responses to request for production of
