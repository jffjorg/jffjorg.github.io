And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motions filed by Plaintiff Rolando Lemus to compel further responses from Defendants Magali Manzara and Richard Manzara. The Court has denied these motions because Lemus failed to re-notice and re-schedule the hearings after the cases were consolidated and reassigned to a different department. Lemus has also failed to provide a sufficient explanation for his delay in re-noticing and re-scheduling the hearings. As a result, the Court finds that Lemus has waived or abandoned his right to proceed with these motions. The motions are hereby denied.
