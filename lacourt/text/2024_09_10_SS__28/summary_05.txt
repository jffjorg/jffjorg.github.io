And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court rules that the case against Defendant Ricardo Mendiola Garcia and Activ Enterprises, LLC will be dismissed due to Alston's failure to comply with Court orders. The Court has previously ordered Alston to serve verified code-compliant responses and produce documents and electronically stored information, but Alston has not complied. The Court finds that sanctions less severe than dismissal will not produce compliance with the discovery rules, and therefore grants the motion for terminating sanctions and dismisses the case. The Court also denies the request for $1,000.00 in monetary sanctions.
