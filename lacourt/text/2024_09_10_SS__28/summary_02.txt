And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. The plaintiff, Ellen Castillo, filed this action against various defendants, including Glenoaks Partners, LLC and others, for general negligence and premises liability. The plaintiff inadvertently waived her right to a jury trial by posting jury fees after the deadline. The court finds that granting the plaintiff relief from the waiver of a jury trial will not prejudice the other parties. Therefore, the court exercises its discretion to grant the motion and allows the plaintiff to retain her right to a jury trial.
