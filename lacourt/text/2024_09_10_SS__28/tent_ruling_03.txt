LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
        “If a party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely
response to it, the following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling
a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent
exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or
any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored
information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of
the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides:         
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.)  
DISCUSSION 
A.   Moving Defendants’ demand for production of documents 
          On May 3, 2024, Moving Defendants served demand for
production of documents, set one, on Plaintiff. 
Plaintiff did not provide timely responses and had not provided
responses by the time Moving Defendants filed this motion. 
          The Court grants Moving Defendants’ motion to compel Plaintiff’s
responses to the demand for production of documents, set one.  The Court orders
Plaintiff to provide verified, code-compliant responses to the requests for
production of documents without objections and to produce the documents,
electronically stored information, and/or other things requested without
objections by September 30, 2024. 
B.   Moving Defendants’ special interrogatories   
On
May 3, 2024, Moving Defendants served special interrogatories, set one, on
Plaintiff.  Plaintiff did not provide
timely responses and had not provided responses by the time Moving Defendants
filed this motion. 
          The Court grants Moving Defendants’ motion to compel
Plaintiff’s responses to special interrogatories, set one.  The Court orders Plaintiff to provide
verified, code-compliant responses to the special interrogatories without
objections by September 30, 2024. 
C.   Moving Defendants’ form interrogatories      
On
May 3, 2024, Camran and Burton each served form interrogatories, set one, on
Plaintiff.  Plaintiff did not provide
timely responses and had not provided responses by the time Moving Defendants
filed this motion. 
          The Court grants Moving Defendants’ motion to compel
Plaintiff’s responses to the separate form interrogatories served by Camran and
Burton.  The Court orders Plaintiff to
provide verified, code-compliant responses to the form interrogatories without
objections by September 30, 2024. 
D.   Moving Defendants’ request for sanctions 
Moving
Defendants request $3,048.80 in sanctions.  Under Code of
Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300, the Court shall impose a
monetary sanction against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories or a demand
for inspection unless the Court finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.  (See
Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c)
[demand for inspection].) 
Plaintiff
did not make or oppose a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or a
demand for inspection. Therefore, sanctions are not available under Code of
Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300. 
Other
statutes addressing misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves,
authorize a sanctions award for these motions. 
In City of Los Angeles v. Pricewaterhousecoopers, LLP (Aug. 23,
2024) __ Cal.5th __ [2024 WL 3894042, 2024 DJDAR 8056, slip opn. pp. 1-42] (PwC),
the Supreme Court held: “It is already well-established that a court may not
rely on [Code of Civil Procedure] section 2023.030 to override the limitations
prescribed by any other applicable sanctions provision in the Act.  A court may
invoke its independent authority to impose sanctions under sections 2023.010
and 2023.030 only when confronted with an unusual form of discovery abuse, or a
pattern of abuse, not already addressed by a relevant sanctions provision.  And
where it invokes that authority, it is constrained by the long-settled rules
generally governing the imposition of discovery sanctions under the Act.”  (PwC, supra, __ Cal.5th __
[2024 WL 3894042 at *18, 2024 DJDAR at p. 8066, slip opn. at p. 40].) 
Code
of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290, subdivision (c), and 2031.300,
subdivision (c), limit the Court’s authority to impose sanctions when (as here)
the non-moving party does not oppose a successful motion to compel responses to
interrogatories or inspection demands. 
Because these statutes address the issue, the Court may not invoke its
independent authority to impose sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure
sections 2023.010 and 2023.030.  (See PwC,
supra, __ Cal.5th __ [2024 WL 3894042 at *18, 2024 DJDAR at p. 8066,
slip opn. at p. 40].) 
The
Court denies Moving Defendants’ sanctions requests.
