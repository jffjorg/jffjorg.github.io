And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has made several key findings in this tentative ruling. First, the plaintiff's objection to the entirety of Vasshegi's declaration is overruled. Second, the defendant's characterization of the plaintiff's actions is unsupported, as the defendant's claw-back letter was sent after the deposition that the defendant points to as evidence of the plaintiff's misuse of the information. Third, the plaintiff filed its own motion in response to the defendant's characterization. The judge also notes that Nick Johnson, a representative of the defendant, acted in a supervisory capacity, not as a legal advisor. Finally, the judge cites a previous case, Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Sup. Ct. (1984), in which the court held that a document was work product because it reflected the lawyer's thought process and was based on the lawyer's opinion.
