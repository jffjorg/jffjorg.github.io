[1] Plaintiff’s
evidentiary objection to the entirety of Vasshegi’s declaration is
overruled. 
 


[2] Defendant appears to
argue that Plaintiff has used this purported privileged information after being
notified of the claimed privilege. However, the deposition that Defendant
points to happened on 2/1/24 (Vasseghi Decl.) which is before the 2/2/24
claw-back letter sent from Defendant to Plaintiff. Accordingly, Defendant’s
characterization that Plaintiff is continuing to misuse the information
is unsupported. (Reply p. 13:25-28.) 
 


[3] For this reason,
Plaintiff filed their own motion. (Opp. p. 17.) 


[4] According to
Plaintiff’s Counsel, it is his understanding that Nick Johnson acts in a supervisory
capacity with Defendant’s consumer resolution group, not in a capacity
of providing legal advice. (See Opp. p. 14:7-11 [“Defendant has failed to
provide sufficient information to determine that Mr. Johnson was working in a
legal and not supervisory capacity or consultant nor has Defendant provided any
evidence that the purpose of the communications in dispute was not to provide
legal advice but rather to approve a document to be sent directly to Plaintiff
in response to their complaints regarding the warranty repair history of the
Subject Vehicle.”].) 
 


[5] Johnson primarily handles
repurchase or replacement evaluation for California Audi brand (car at issue).

Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Sup. Ct. . (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 467 [law firm's prelitigation investigation supports prima
facie claim of privilege].)
 


[7] More specifically,
the trial court’s determination (which the state supreme court upheld) that the
document was work product was based upon the following reasoning: “[A]though it doesn't contain overt statements setting
forth the lawyer's conclusions, its very existence is owed to the lawyer's
thought process. The document reflects not only the strategy, but also the
attorney's opinion as to the important issues in the case. Directions were
provided by [counsel] as to the key pieces of information to be recorded, and
[counsel] also added his own input as to the important details, by inserting
other words in the notes. The attorney's impressions of the case were the
filter through which all the discussions at the conference were passed through
on the way to the page.” (Id. at p. 815.)

not receive a physical, unredacted copy.
