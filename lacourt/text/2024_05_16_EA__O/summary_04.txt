And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the pleadings in this matter and has made a tentative ruling. The plaintiff has alleged that he was harmed due to a misrepresentation by the defendant, Temco. The judge finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently pled causation, although the causal relationship is unclear. The judge also finds that the individuals involved, including Ray, had the authority to speak on behalf of Temco. The judge notes that the plaintiff has not shown that these individuals possessed the authority to speak on behalf of Temco, but finds that they did have the authority for purposes of a demurrer. The judge also references California law and case law, including Pearson v. Norton and Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change and will be finalized after considering further arguments and evidence.
