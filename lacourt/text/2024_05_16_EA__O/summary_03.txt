Significant Statements:
  - "Fraud, however, is never presumed." (Mason v. Drug Inc. (1939) 31 Cal.App.2d 697, 703)
  - "The elements of fraud, which give rise to the tort action for deceit, are (a) misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or 'scienter'); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage." (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631)
  - "A plaintiff has a greater burden in asserting a fraud claim against a corporate employer in that he must 'allege the names of the persons who made the allegedly fraudulent representations, their authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was said or written.'" (Opp. 4, quoting Tarmann v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157)
  - "Though denial of leave to amend on the first demurrer would likely be an abuse of discretion here, the court has already awarded leave to amend on a near identical issue (pleading fraud). And as the FAC does not allege new or sufficient facts, suggesting that leave to amend would be futile."
