Background
Pleadings
Plaintiff Jayla Taylor brings this
habitability action against Defendants 600 Tower, LLC, SB DTLA 1 LLC, SB DTLA 2 LLC, SB DTLA 3 LLC, SB DTLA 4, LLC, Greystar
California, Inc., Lea Kim, Barry Shy, Eric Shy, Rommy Shy, and Does 1-100
pursuant to a verified March 24, 2023 Complaint alleging claims of (1)
Violation of California Civil Code § 1942.4, (2) Tortious Breach of the
Warranty of Habitability, (3) Private Nuisance, (4) Business and Professions
Code § 17200, et seq., (5) Negligence, (6) Breach of the Covenant of Quiet
Enjoyment, and (7) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED).
The claims arise from allegations that, among other things, during her
tenancy of Unit 417 (Subject Premises) at 600 S. Spring Street, Los Angeles,
California 90014 (Subject Property)—a unit alleged to fall under the Rent
Stabilization Ordinance (RSO) of the Los Angeles Municipal Code
(LAMC)—Plaintiff experienced various substandard conditions, such as
inconsistent hot water supply, defective fire alarms, dysfunctional plumbing,
leaking pipes and sewage, low water pressure, dysfunctional electrical systems,
rodents, missing balcony doorknob, inoperable elevator, inadequate security,
and inoperable smoke alarms. Plaintiff further alleges that she reported these
conditions to Defendants numerous times, only for Defendants to ignore these
complaints or promise to fix the issues but ultimately failing to do so.
Defendants are alleged to have been managers, owners, or agents of the
Subject Property, with Defendants acting as one another’s employees, agents,
associates, joint venturers, managers, directors, board members, partners,
trustees, or beneficiaries of Defendants and/or Defendants’ companies or
organizations.
Motion Before the Court
On June 5, 2023, Defendant 600 Tower,
LLC (600 Tower) filed and served an unverified Answer to Complaint.
On June 29, 2023, Plaintiff Taylor
moved to strike 600 Tower’s unverified Answer for failure to comply with the
verification requirement imposed by Code of Civil Procedure section 446,
subdivision (a).
On August 10, 2023, Defendant 600
Tower filed a verified Amended Answer to Complaint.
Plaintiff Taylor has not filed a
reply or other paper in relation to this motion, which is now before the Court.
 
Motion to Strike
Legal
Standard
The
court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion and upon terms it
deems proper: (a) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted
in any pleading; or (b) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of
the court. (Code Civ. Proc. § 436, subds. (a), (b); Stafford v. Shultz
(1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the
claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or
disregarded”].)
For
the purposes of a motion to strike pursuant to Sections 435 to 437 of the Code
of Civil Procedure, the term “pleading” generally means a demurrer, answer,
complaint, or cross-complaint, (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (a)), and an
immaterial allegation or irrelevant matter in a pleading entails (1) an
allegation that is not essential to the statement of a claim or defense, (2) an
allegation that is neither pertinent to nor supported by an otherwise
sufficient claim or defense, or (3) a demand for judgment requesting relief not
supported by the allegations of the complaint or cross-complaint (Code Civ.
Proc., § 431.10, subds. (b)(1)-(3), (c)).
Order
Striking Answer: MOOT.
Plaintiff’s
motion seeks to strike the now-superseded June 5, 2023 Answer to Complaint by
Defendant 600 Tower on the ground that Code of Civil Procedure section 446,
subdivision (a), requires that an answer to a verified complaint also be
verified, which the June 5, 2023 Answer is not. (Mot., pp. 3-5.)
While
the Court recognizes the merit of this position, Defendant 600 Tower has since
filed an Amended Answer that is verified. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 446, subd.
(a) [“When the complaint is verified, the answer shall be verified”]; 8/10/23
Amended Answer, Verification [Amended Answer verified by 600 Tower’s General
Manager].)
Plaintiff’s
motion is therefore MOOT because the pleading against which it is directed has
been superseded. 

Conclusion
Plaintiff Jayla Taylor’s Motion to
Strike the Answer in its Entirety, or Alternatively, Portions of Answer to
Complaint is MOOT.
