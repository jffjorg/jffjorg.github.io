 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff Javier
  Alarcon Munoz’s Motion to Deem as Admitted the Genuineness of Documents and
  the Truth of Matters Specified in the Requests for Admission (Set 1) Against Defendants
  Schoolsfirst Insurance Services, LLC and Ivonne Maria Guerrero, and Request
  for Sanctions.



 
Background
Plaintiff Javier Alarcon Munoz sues
Defendants Juvenal Alejandro Farias (Farias), Bargain Rent-a-Car dba Lexus of
Cerritos (Cerritos Lexus), Schoolsfirst Insurance Services, LLC (Schoolsfirst), Ivonne Maria Guerrero
(Guerrero), Mercury Insurance Company (Mercury Ins. Co.), Mercury General
Corporation (dismissed with prejudice on May 26, 2023), and Does 5-50 pursuant
to an October 12, 2022 Fourth Amended Complaint alleging claims of (1)
Revocation of Acceptance of Goods, (2) Rescission, (3) Breach of Oral Contract,
(4) Breach of Implied-in-Fact Contract, (5) Breach of Written Contract, (6) Fraud,
(7) Violations of Consumer Legal Remedies Act, (8) Violation of Unfair Business
Practices Act/Unfair Competition, (9) Violation of Penal Code Section 496, (10)
Common Counts (Money Had and Received), (11) Breach of Fiduciary Duty, (12)
Negligence, (13) Negligent Misrepresentation, and (14) Reformation / Revision.
The claims arise from allegations
that, among other things, these Defendants provided Plaintiff with an
automobile insurance policy that did not provide full / comprehensive coverage
for a vehicle that Plaintiff purchased from Lexus of Cerritos through Juvenal
Farias, which Farias represented to be a 2015 Lexus model number “RC F” with
“[n]o issues, no problems,” only for Plaintiff to later discover that the
vehicle was salvage-titled, carried an invalid VIN number, was not marketable,
and may have had other problems.
On September 16, 2022, Plaintiff’s
counsel served discovery on counsel for Defendants Schoolsfirst and Guerrero,
including Request for Admission (Set 1) (RFAs, Set One).
Counsel for Schoolsfirst and
Guerrero did not request an extension to provide responses to this discovery.
By February 8, 2023, Plaintiff had
not received responses to RFAs, Set One from Schoolsfirst or Guerrero.
That same day, Plaintiff filed a
motion to deem RFAs, Set One, deemed admitted against Schoolsfirst and
Guerrero. The motion also seeks monetary sanctions. (See CRS# 5318 and 3002.)
On September 11, 2023, Schoolsfirst
and Guerrero opposed Plaintiff’s motion. A declaration by counsel attached to
the motion represents that these Defendants failed to respond due to a failure
to calendar the response date for the discovery. Counsel also represents that
production of the RFA responses will be made prior to this hearing, thus
indicating that as of September 11, 2023, Schoolsfirst and Guerrero had not
served responses to RFAs, Set One.
On September 14, 2023, Plaintiff
replied to Schoolsfirst and Guerrero’s opposition. The opposition represents
that as of the time of filing of the reply, Schoolsfirst and Guerrero had not
served responses to RFAs, Set One.
Plaintiff’s motion to deem RFAs
admitted is now before the Court.
 
Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted
Legal
Standard
The
discovering party can make a motion to deem as admitted any unanswered requests
for admission or any requests answered in a late or unverified response. (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.240, subd. (a)
[RFA responses must be signed by responding party under oath]; see Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636 [unsworn response to RFAs
is treated like no response].) These requests are not automatically deemed
admitted; the discovery party must make the motion. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (b).)
To
establish this ground, a movant must show:
(1)
Proper service (see Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.070);
(2)
Expiration of the deadline for the initial response 30 days after service or on
date agreed to by parties (see Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subds. (a), (b));
and
(3)
That (a) the responding party served no response (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (b)), (b) the propounding party served a late response (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (b)); or (3) the responding party served an unsworn response
(see Appleton v. Superior Court, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at p. 636
[unsworn response to RFAs is treated like no response]).
A
court must deny a motion to compel initial discovery where the discovery sought
is outside the scope of discovery. (See CBS, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12, 19; see also Code. Civ. Proc., § 2017.010 [scope of
discovery].) 
Order
Deeming RFAs Admitted: GRANTED.
Plaintiff
provides evidence showing his service of Schoolsfirst’s and Guerrero’s RFAs,
Set One. (Mot., Ex. 1, Proof of Service [two separate RFAs, Set One, shown in
Exhibit 1, one directed at Schoolsfirst and another directed at Guerrero].)
Plaintiff
provides evidence showing that Schoolsfirst’s and Guerrero’s deadline to
respond to RFAs, Set One—per Plaintiff, October 18, 2022—has expired. (Mot.,
Vardapour Decl., ¶ 4.)
Plaintiff
provides evidence showing that as of September 14, 2023, no responses to RFAs,
Set One, have been served by Schoolsfirst and Guerrero. (Reply, Vardapour
Decl., ¶ 3.)
The
Court’s review of RFAs, Set One, shows that they are within the scope of
discovery because the six requested admissions involve matters that will result
in admissible evidence or are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence, e.g., admissions relating to the issuance of insurance
policies, comprehensive coverage, premium costs, and email communications
between the parties. (See Mot., Vardapour Decl., Ex. 1.)
The
only defense against granting of this motion raised by Schoolsfirst and
Guerrero’s opposition is that responses to RFAs, Set One, would be provided by
the date of this hearing. (Opp’n, p. 3.) However, it does not appear that such
responses have been provided by Schoolsfirst and Guerrero.
Plaintiff’s
motion is therefore GRANTED.
Sanctions:
GRANTED.
The
Court must award sanctions when a party’s response is untimely, and the
discovering party makes a motion to deem the requests admitted. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see Stover v. Bruntz (2017) 12 Cal.App.5th
19, 31-32; Appleton v. Superior Court, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at
pp. 635-636 [sanctions are mandatory].)
The
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
Here,
the Court determines that sanctions are mandatory against Schoolsfirst and
Guerrero. These Defendants have made no response to RFAs, Set One, and Plaintiff
has made a motion to deem the RFAs admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (c); see Stover v. Bruntz (2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 19, 31-32; Appleton
v. Superior Court, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at pp. 635-636.) The Court
also notes that the opposition argument that more meet-and-confer efforts
should have been made by Plaintiff is unavailing. (Opp’n, p. 4.) Schoolsfirst
and Guerrero’s conduct in failing to respond to RFAs, Set One, as of September
14, 2023 partly informs this determination. Moreover, as noted by the
opposition, the Code does not require meet-and-confer efforts for this type of
motion. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)
Sanctions
are GRANTED in the amount of $1,867.34, comprised of 1.9 hours expended by
counsel drafting this motion at a reasonable and supported rate of $350 per
hour, three hours expended by counsel and to be expended by counsel replying to
the opposition and appearing at this hearing at the same rate, and $152.34 in
costs relating to hearing and e-filing fees. (Mot., p. 5; Mot., Vardapour
Decl., ¶¶ 5-5(b).)
