## Case Summary:

**Case Number:** 23STCV06541
**Hearing Date:** September 25, 2023
**Department:** 40, Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles

**Plaintiff:** Jayla Taylor
**Defendants:** 600 Tower, LLC; SB DTLA I LLC; SB DTLA 2 LLC; SB DTLA 3 LLC; SB DTLA 4 LLC; Greystar California Inc.; Lea Kim; Barry Shy; Eric Shy; Rommy Shy; and Does 1-100

**Background:**

* Plaintiff Jayla Taylor filed a complaint alleging habitability issues at her rental unit (Unit 417) at 600 S. Spring Street, Los Angeles, California 90014. 
* The complaint invokes various legal claims including Violation of California Civil Code § 1942.4, Tortious Breach of the Warranty of Habitability, Private Nuisance, Business and Professions Code § 17200, et seq., Negligence, Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment, and Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED).
* Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants, who are alleged to be managers, owners, or agents of the property, were negligent in addressing her repeated complaints about various issues such as water supply, plumbing, electrical systems, pest infestation, security, etc.

**Motion Before the Court:**

* On June 5, 2023, Defendant 600 Tower, LLC filed an unverified Answer to the Complaint.
* Plaintiff moved to strike the unverified Answer because Code of Civil Procedure section 446, subdivision (a) requires an answer to a verified complaint to be verified.
* On August 10, 2023, Defendant 600 Tower, LLC filed a verified Amended Answer to the Complaint.

**Ruling:**

* The Court finds Plaintiff's motion to strike the original Answer **MOOT** because it has been superseded by the verified Amended Answer.


**English Summary:**

The judge ruled that the Plaintiff's motion to strike the initial Answer from Defendant 600 Tower, LLC is no longer relevant ("MOOT"). This is because the Defendant had already filed a new, verified Answer that complies with the legal requirement for an answer to a verified complaint.
