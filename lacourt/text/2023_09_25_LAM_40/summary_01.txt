English text:
The Judge grants Plaintiff Javier Alarcon Munoz's motion to deem the genuineness of documents and the truth of matters specified in the Request for Admission (Set 1) against Defendants Schoolsfirst Insurance Services, LLC and Ivonne Maria Guerrero. The corresponding Request for Sanctions is also granted in the amount of $1,867.34, which Defendants Schoolsfirst Insurance Services, LLC and Ivonne Maria Guerrero are ordered to remit to Plaintiff Javier Alarcon Munoz within 14 days of this ruling.
