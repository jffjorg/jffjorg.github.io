## Case Summary: Alarcon Munoz v. Farias et al. 

**Case Number:** 21STCV13617
**Hearing Date:** September 25, 2023
**Court:** Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, Department 40

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Javier Alarcon Munoz
* **Defendants:** 
    * Juvenal Alejandro Farias
    * Bargain Rent-A-Car dba Lexus of Cerritos
    * Schoolsfirst Insurance Services, LLC
    * Ivonne Maria Guerrero
    * Mercury Insurance Company
    * Mercury General Corporation (dismissed with prejudice on May 26, 2023)
    * Does 5-50

**Summary:**

This case stems from an alleged misrepresentation of an automobile insurance policy's coverage by Defendants. 

Plaintiff Alarcon Munoz purchased a vehicle from Defendant Farias, represented as a 2015 Lexus RC F with no issues. However, the vehicle was later discovered to be salvage-titled, have an invalid VIN number, and potentially have other undisclosed problems. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants Schoolsfirst Insurance Services, LLC and Ivonne Maria Guerrero provided an insufficient insurance policy that did not cover these issues. 

Plaintiff moved to deem certain requests for admission (RFAs) against Schoolsfirst and Guerrero as admitted because they failed to respond within the deadline. 

**Judge's Ruling:**

The Judge **granted** Plaintiff's motion to deem the RFAs admitted. The Judge found that Schoolsfirst and Guerrero failed to respond to the RFAs within the required timeframe, and their late production of responses did not excuse this failure.

The Judge also **awarded** Plaintiff sanctions in the amount of $1,867.34 for the time and costs incurred in preparing the motion.

**Significant Statements:**

* The Court emphasized that although meet-and-confer efforts are encouraged in discovery disputes, they are not required for a motion to deem RFAs admitted.

**Legal Basis:** 

The ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2033.280 and 2033.240, which govern requests for admissions and sanctions for noncompliance.
