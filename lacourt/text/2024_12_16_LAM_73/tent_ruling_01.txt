As
an initial matter, Plaintiff’s request for civil penalties under PAGA does not
appear to be proper. 
 
A “ ‘[PAGA]
action to recover civil penalties “is fundamentally a law enforcement action
designed to protect the public and not to benefit private parties.” ’ ”  (Iskanian
v. CLS Transportation Los Angeles (2014) 59 Cal.4th 348, 381.) 
Labor Code section 2699, subdivision (i) requires that 75 percent of the civil
penalties be distributed to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency and 25
percent to the aggrieved employees.  
 
The PAGA
plaintiff does not receive the full 25 percent share of the civil penalties;
rather, it must be shared by all aggrieved employees. (Moorer v. Noble L.A.
Events, Inc. (2019) 32 Cal.App.5th 736, 738 [affirming trial court’s denial
of default judgment because PAGA plaintiff refused to comply with order to
distribute 25 percent of the civil penalties to 23 other aggrieved employees on
a pro rata basis].)  
 
Here, Plaintiff is seeking penalties
pursuant to PAGA only on behalf of himself. Plaintiff states that penalties
for this claim total one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) with seventy-five percent
(75%) of that penalty, or seven hundred and fifty dollars ($750), to be paid to
the Labor & Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) and Plaintiff will receive
the remaining twenty-five percent (25%) or two hundred and fifty dollars
($250). (Puig Decl., ¶ 27.)
 
However, a plaintiff
seeking individual penalties and not on behalf of other employees, is not
allowed.  “[T]he PAGA statute provides that plaintiffs can recover
penalties through a civil action brought ‘on behalf of himself or herself and
other current or former employees.’”  (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (a),
italics added.)  “[A] PAGA claim may not be brought solely on the
employee’s behalf, but must be brought in a representative capacity.”  (Williams
v. Superior Court (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 642, 649; see also (Kansupda v.
Baptista Delivery Services., LLC¿(N.D.Cal. Mar. 31, 2022, No.
4:18-cv-02133-KAW) 2022 U.S.Dist.Lexis 111673, *23-24.) Therefore, Plaintiff’s
request for PAGA penalties is improper.
 
In addition, the Court notes that
Plaintiff does not appear to provide sufficient information as to his claimed
damages. For example, Plaintiff seeks reimbursement for expenditures. In the
brief filed in support of Plaintiff’s request for default judgment, Plaintiff
states:
 
“Defendants
forced Plaintiff to pay for expenses without receiving reimbursement for such expenditures,
including but not limited to, costs associated with use of Plaintiffs personal
cellphone and maintenance of his work uniform provided to him by Defendants. (See
Declaration of Eric Puig, ¶ 18.) The business expenses incurred by Plaintiff
during his employment with Defendants totals one hundred and fifty dollars
($150.00). To date, Plaintiff has not been reimbursed by Defendants for the
expenditures incurred during his employment.”
 
In Plaintiff’s declaration he vaguely states: “Defendants required
me to use my own personal cell phone for work-related purposes. I was also
required to maintain my own uniform. I was never reimbursed by Defendants for
these expenses that I personally incurred.” (Puig Decl., ¶ 18.) 
 
However, Plaintiff does not specify how he calculated the $150
business expenses he incurred or provide any receipts of these expenses. 
 
“Plaintiffs
in a default judgment proceeding must prove they are entitled to the damages
claimed.” (Barragan v. Banco BCH (1986) 188 Cal.App.3d 283, 302, citing
Code Civ. Proc., § 585 & Taliaferro v. Hoogs (1963) 219 Cal.App.2d
559, 560.)  If evidence is presented by declaration, the facts must be
shown to be “within the personal knowledge of the affiant and shall be set
forth with particularity, and each affidavit shall show affirmatively that the
affiant, if sworn as a witness, can testify competently thereto.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 585, subd. (d).) Here, Plaintiff has not provided sufficient information.
 
The Court
also notes that Plaintiff seeks entry of default judgment against Defendants
Goodpeople Roasting LLC, GP Group LLC and Carlos Herrera. Plaintiff added
Defendant, Carlos Herrera, as Doe 1. However, on October 8, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed Does 1
through 50 without prejudice. Therefore, it appears Plaintiff dismissed Defendant,
Carlos Herrera, as Doe 1.
 
Plaintiff’s request for entry of
default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
 
III. DISPOSITION

 
For the foregoing
reasons, Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment against Defendants
Goodpeople Roasting LLC, GP Group LLC and Carlos Herrera is DENIED without
prejudice.
