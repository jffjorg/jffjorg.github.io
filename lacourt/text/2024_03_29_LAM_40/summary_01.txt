And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants Plaintiff Calima Electric, Inc.'s motion for leave to amend its complaint. The proposed amendment eliminates the fourth cause of action and adds new claims against The Hatch Group, Inc. and its owner, Ronald L. Hatch. The Judge rejects The Hatch Group, Inc.'s opposition to the motion, citing the opposition's failure to discuss the exception to the rule stated in subdivision (e) of Civil Code section 7031. The Judge notes that any dispute as to licensure or exceptions thereto would best be addressed in an evidentiary motion, which is premature at this juncture. The proposed amendment must be filed with the Court in the same form as now attached to the Gharakhani declaration as Exhibit A within 5 days of this ruling.
