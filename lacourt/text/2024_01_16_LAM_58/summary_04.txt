And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling by the judge addresses the issue of whether the plaintiff was qualified to perform the essential functions of their job at the time of their termination. The defendant relies on after-acquired evidence that shows the plaintiff lacked a required degree for the position, but the court is considering this evidence to determine whether the plaintiff was qualified at the time of their termination. The court notes that the McKennon rule, which prohibits after-acquired evidence as a defense to discriminatory motive, does not apply to the "qualified individual" element of an ADA claim. The court further holds that the qualification determination is not limited to "facts known to the employer at the time of the challenged employment action," but rather is determined based on the employee's actual qualifications at the time of the adverse employment action.
