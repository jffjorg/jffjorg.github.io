[1] Defendants originally filed the
motion for protective order on February 15, 2024.


[2] During his medical leave, Chavez’s
abled-bodied colleague, Castellanos, temporarily assumed Chavez’s duties.  After Chavez returned to medical leave, he
alleges Castellanos continued working in Chavez’s former role.  With the second PMQ deposition, Chavez seeks
to show Defendants’ efforts to protect Castellanos.  As Chavez alleges, transferring Castellanos
to a different department ensured that Castellanos would not be compared to
Chavez in the selection for inclusion in a reduction in force even though Castellanos
possessed far less experience than Chavez.


[3] In Reply, Defendants raise new
arguments about Plaintiff’s counsel’s conduct. 
As the argument is raised for the first time in Reply, the court does
address or consider the argument any further.
