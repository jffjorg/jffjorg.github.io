MOTION
FOR ORDER FOR PHYSICAL EXAMINATION



 
MOVING PARTY:              Defendants Charmane mark and Matthew Mark, as trustees for
USRE trust
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Sannette Gite
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
This is a quiet title action concerning the real property at
8940 Kramerwood Place, Los Angeles, California 90034 (the “Property”).  On December 6, 2021, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
U.S. Bank National Association (“US Bank”), as trustee for Velocity Commercial
Capital Loan Trust  2019-3, filed a
Complaint against Defendant/Cross-Complainant Sannette Gite (“Gite”). .
 
On January 13, 2023, Gite filed her operative First Amended
Cross-Complaint, naming as Cross-Defendants Charmane Mark and Matthew Mark, as
trustees for USRE trust (the “Mark Defendants”).
 
On February 20, 2024, the Mark Defendants filed this Motion
for Order for Physical Examination of Defendant Sannette Gite Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure Section 2032.310.  
 
Gite filed an opposition and requests sanctions against the
Mark Defendants. 
 
The Mark Defendants replied.
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD
 
“Except for defense physicals in personal injury cases (¶
8:1516) and exams arranged by stipulation (¶ 8:1512), a court order is required
for a § 2032.010 et seq. physical or mental examination. Such order may be made
only after notice and hearing, and for “good cause shown.” [CCP § 2032.320(a);
see Conservatorship of G.H. (2014) 227 CA4th 1435, 1441, 174 CR3d 536,
540].” (Weil & Brown, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial (The Rutter
Group 2023) ¶ 8:1546.)

7.     
Amended Judgment filed on April 9,

The requests
are GRANTED.  (Evid. Code, § 452, subds.
(d), (h).)
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
            The Mark Defendants seek an order to compel Gite to sit for
a physical examination for her fingerprints to be taken.  They argue good cause exists order the
examination because Gite’s fingerprints are in controversy.  As explained by Mark Defendants, the source
of a break in the chain of title to the Property may be traced to a grant deed
that Gite conveyed to Lions Proof LLC on September 19, 2011 (the “Deed”).  The Deed was notarized.  Gite claims the Deed is a forgery.  US Bank contends otherwise.   Mark
Defendants wish to compare Gite’s fingerprints to the fingerprint which appears
in the notary’s log entry to determine whether the Deed is a forgery.  
 
            Based on
the foregoing, the court finds good cause exists to compel Gite’s physical
examination.  Gite claims the Deed is a
forgery.  The Deed was notarized.  Gite’s fingerprints are  relevant. 
 
            In
opposition, Gite argues the motion should be denied because a court has already
determined in  prior cases (Los Angeles
County Superior Court, Case Nos. BC588697 and BC692757) that Defendant/Cross-Defendant
Yong Hwa Chung—the party who claimed the competing title to the Property—lacks
title to the Property.  Not so.  The Judgment in that case awarded possession
of the premises at the Property to Gite. 
It did not award title to the Property. 
(See RJN 3, 5.)  For this reason,
Gite’s argument that her right to immediate possession of the Property operates
as collateral estoppel in this action fails. 
Gite’s collateral estoppel arguments rests on the flawed notion that
title to the Property has already been determined.  Moreover, even if Gite’s title to the
Property was adjudged in her favor in Case Nos. BC588697 and BC692757 (they
were not), those judgments are not binding on US Bank.  US Bank was neither a party to nor in privity
with any party in that action.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            Accordingly,
the motion is GRANTED. 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Sannette Gite, as trustee of the
Vaughn Family Trust, is ordered to appear for physical at Early Sullivan Wright
Gizer & McRae LLP, at 6420 Wilshire Boulevard 17th Floor Los Angeles,
California 90048, on April 22, 2024 at 10:30 a.m. for fingerprint samples to be
obtained from each finger on each hand of Gite. 
The examination is to be conducted by certified latent print examiner Ms.
Diane Do.
 
            Gite’s
request for sanctions is DENIED.
 
Moving party to give notice, unless waived.
