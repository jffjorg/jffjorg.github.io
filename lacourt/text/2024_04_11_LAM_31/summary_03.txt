And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Court has granted the motion for order for physical examination of Defendant Sannette Gite. The Mark Defendants seek to compare Gite's fingerprints to the fingerprint in the notary's log entry to determine whether the grant deed is a forgery. Gite claims the deed is a forgery, while US Bank contends otherwise. The Court finds good cause exists to compel Gite's physical examination. The motion is granted, and Gite is ordered to appear for a physical examination on April 22, 2024, at 10:30 a.m.
