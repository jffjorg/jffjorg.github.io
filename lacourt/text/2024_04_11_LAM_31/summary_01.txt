And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants in part and denies in part the motion for protective order filed by the defendants, Schlumberger Technology Corporation and Timothy Ramey, to prevent a second deposition of Schlumberger's person most qualified (PMQ). The judge finds that the defendants do not demonstrate good cause to prevent the deposition and that the burdens of the deposition do not clearly outweigh the benefits sought. The judge orders the second deposition of Schlumberger's PMQ to take place within 60 days of the order. The judge also denies the defendants' request for sanctions.
