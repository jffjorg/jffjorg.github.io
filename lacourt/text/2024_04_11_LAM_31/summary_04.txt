And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling grants the Motion for Summary Judgment filed by National General Insurance Company and Integon National Insurance Company. The ruling is based on the undisputed facts that Martin Ambriz, the policyholder, failed to disclose his son Adam Gomez, who was an undisclosed household member and over 14 years old, on the insurance application. The Judge finds that the Defendants have met their initial burden and the burden shifts to the Plaintiffs to show a triable issue of material facts. Since the Plaintiffs have not filed an opposition, the Judge grants the Motion for Summary Judgment. The Defendants are ordered to file a proposed judgment within 10 days.
