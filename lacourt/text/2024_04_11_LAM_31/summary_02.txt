And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion for protective order filed by the Defendants on February 15, 2024. The Plaintiff, Chavez, alleges that his colleague, Castellanos, was temporarily assigned to work in his former role during his medical leave. Chavez claims that after his return, Castellanos continued to work in his former role, and that the Defendants transferred Castellanos to a different department to ensure he would not be compared to Chavez in the selection process for a reduction in force. The court notes that Castellanos had less experience than Chavez. In their reply, the Defendants raised new arguments about the Plaintiff's counsel's conduct, which the court will not address further as it is raised for the first time in reply.
