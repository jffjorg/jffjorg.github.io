Significant Statements:
  - The Court is aware that law firms handling high-volume litigation like Song-Beverly Act cases creates pressures especially on junior lawyers.
  - At the same time, even junior lawyers must accept responsibility for tracking deadlines, managing dockets, and complying with orders especially once a prior mistake or neglect has been the subject of law and motion activity in a pending litigated case.
  - Missing deadlines is big deal, but can often be fixed. Missing deadlines imposed by a judge is a bigger deal.

Summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is issued by a Judge regarding a Motion for Additional Sanctions brought by Plaintiffs Giuseppe Sanzone and Caroline Petersen against Defendant FCA US LLC. The Plaintiffs contend that Defendant failed to comply with a Court order to pay $2,500 in monetary sanctions, which was due by April 19, 2024. The Defendant's counsel provided an unacceptable excuse for the delay, claiming that the law firm's accounting department was backlogged. The Court notes that while Defendant's failure to comply with the Court order is not willful, it is still a serious violation. The Court intends to allow Defendant's counsel to argue the appropriate judicial response to this situation.
