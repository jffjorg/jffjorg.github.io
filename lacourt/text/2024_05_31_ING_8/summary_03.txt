And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court is granting the plaintiff's motion to deem the requests for admission as admitted. The plaintiff, Citibank N.A., filed a complaint against the defendant, Karen S. Okihara, alleging a cause of action for common counts. The plaintiff alleges that it lent money to the defendant in the amount of $25,036.04, which the defendant still owes despite the plaintiff's demand. The plaintiff served the defendant with requests for admission, but the defendant failed to respond. The plaintiff then brought a motion to deem the requests for admission as admitted. The court finds that the defendant failed to respond to the discovery requests and failed to oppose the motion. The court grants the motion and deems the requests for admission as admitted.
