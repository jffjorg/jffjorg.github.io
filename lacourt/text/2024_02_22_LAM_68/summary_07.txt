The plaintiff, M.N.A., a non-verbal minor diagnosed with cerebral palsy and autism, alleges abusive conduct and verbal abuse occurred at Keith Family Child Care, operated by defendant Yolanda Jenkins Keith. The plaintiff has filed multiple amended complaints, and a default judgment was entered against Keith. The court finds that the motion is sufficiently supported and that the delay in filing the motion is not prejudicial. The court orders the plaintiff to file a separate copy of the fourth amended complaint within 10 days of the order and sets an OSC re: Default and Default Judgment at the time of the hearing.
