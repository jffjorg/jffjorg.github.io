Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to vacate and enter a different judgment filed by the plaintiffs, West Coast Add It Up Agency and Wi Miller, against the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Authority and others. The plaintiffs contend that the court's decision sustaining the demurrer of the defendant without leave to amend was improper and that the court relied on false information. The judge is transferring the hearing of the motion to Judge Douglas Stern, who is now assigned to the Torrance court, and instructing the clerk to forward the subject order to Judge Stern. The judge is also instructing the plaintiffs to arrange for the hearing of the motion in the courtroom.
