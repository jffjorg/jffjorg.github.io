And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a fourth amended complaint. The plaintiff, a non-verbal minor with cerebral palsy and autism, seeks to add monetary damages as an element of the operative action. The current operative complaint only states damages as "according to proof," which would render any judgment voidable. The motion is unopposed, and the plaintiff has filed a separate declaration supporting the motion. The court finds that the motion is sufficiently supported and that the delay in filing the motion was not caused by any showing of real prejudice. The trial date remains vacated, but the court will set an OSC re: Default and Default Judgment at the time of the hearing.
