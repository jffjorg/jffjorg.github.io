REQUESTED
Motion
for Leave to Amend to File a Fourth Amended Complaint
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff
M.N.A., a non-verbal minor diagnosed with cerebral palsy and autism, received
care from a licensed facility operated by defendant Yolanda Jenkins Keith,
individually and dba Keith Family Child Care (Keith). Plaintiff alleges abusive
conduct, including bare handed strikes on the head, back, neck and shoulders,
and verbal abuse, occurred on the premises. Plaintiff further contends the
government entity licensing entities were aware of prior complaints involving
the facility, yet continued to allow the facility to operate. 
 
On
May 19, 2020, plaintiff M.N.A. through guardian ad litem Ashely Holmes filed a
complaint for Violation of Unruh Civil Rights Act, Negligence; General
Liability, Negligent Issuance and Renewal Of License, Violation of Mandatory
Duties Imposed Bylaw, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, Battery,
and, Assault. On December 1, 2021, defendant Child Care Resources Center, Inc.
answered the complaint and filed a cross-complaint for Express Indemnity,
Equitable Indemnity, Comparative Indemnity, Contribution, and Declaratory
Relief against Keith. 
 
On
March 30, 2022, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint for Negligence
General Liability, Negligent Issuance and Renewal of License, Violation of
Mandatory Duties Imposed Bylaw, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress,
Battery, and Assault. On June 21, 2022, the court sustained the demurrer of
California Department of Social Services to the first amended complaint with 20
days leave to amend. On July 6, 2022, Plaintiff filed a second amended
complaint for Negligence - General Liability, Violation of Mandatory Duties
Imposed by Law, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, Battery, and
Assault. On August 29, 2022, the court sustained the demurrer of California
Department of Social Services to the second amended complaint with 30 days leave
to amend.
 
On
September 26, 2022, Plaintiff filed a third amended complaint for Negligence -
General Liability, Violation of Mandatory Duties Imposed by Law, Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress, Battery, and Assault. On November 29, 2022,
court sustained the demurrer of California Department of Social Services and
California Department of General Services to the third amended complaint
without leave to amend. The court also granted the motion to strike of the
respective defendants without leave to amend. 
 
On
January 11, 2023, the clerk entered a default against Keith. On December 20,
2023, the court granted the motion for summary judgment brought by defendant
Child Care Resources Center, Inc. 
 
The
court entered judgment in favor of the State of California on December 20,
2023, and judgment in favor of Child Care Resources Center, Inc. on January 30,
2024. 
 
RULING: Granted
Plaintiff
M.N.A., a minor by and through guardian ad litem, Ashley Holmes, moves for
leave to file a fourth amended complaint. Plaintiff moves for leave in order to
add monetary damages as an element of the operative action—a necessary
precursor to obtaining a default judgment against sole remaining defendant Yolanda
Jenkins Keith, individually and dba Keith Family Child Care (Keith). The current operative complaint only states
damages as “according to proof,” which would render any judgment voidable. The motion is
unopposed; Keith may not file an opposition to the motion. (Devlin
v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc. (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 381, 385–386.)
 
A
motion for leave to amend must comply with the requirements set forth in
California Rules of Court Rule 3.1324, which states as follows:
 
“(a)      Contents of motion
A
motion to amend a pleading before trial must:
(1)              
Include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended
pleading, which must be serially numbered to differentiate it from previous
pleadings or amendments;
(2)              
State what allegations in the previous pleading are
proposed to be deleted, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number,
the deleted allegations are located; and 
(3)              
State what allegations are proposed to be added to the
previous pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the
additional allegations are located.
 
(b)        Supporting declaration
A
separate declaration must accompany the motion and must specify:
(1)        The effect of the amendment;
(2)        Why the amendment is necessary and
proper;
(3)        When the facts giving
rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and 
(4)              
The reasons why the request for amendment was not made 
earlier…” (emphasis added).
 
Leave to amend is generally liberally granted. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 473(a); Mesler v. Bragg
Management Co. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 290, 296.) The court will not generally
consider the validity of the proposed amended pleading in ruling on a motion
for leave, instead deferring such determinations for a demurrer or motion to
strike, unless the proposed amendment fails to state a valid claim as a matter
of law. (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Marker, U.S.A.) (1989) 213
Cal. App.3d 1045, 1048; California
Casualty Gen. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 274, 280–281
disapproved of on other grounds by
Kransco v. American Empire Surplus Lines Ins. Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 390.) 
 
Dilatory delays and prejudice to the opposing parties is a
valid ground for denial. (Hirsa v.
Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490.)  Prejudice exists where the amendment would
require delaying the trial, resulting in loss of critical evidence, or added
costs of preparation such as an increased burden of discovery. (Magpali v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48
Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488.) 
 
The motion was filed more than three years after the initial
complaint. Counsel admits the delay was a result of oversight in the prior
drafts of the complaint. [Declaration of George Pacheco.] The court finds the motion is sufficiently supported, and
the delay lacking any showing of real prejudice given the default.
 
The motion is therefore granted. Moving
party to file a separate copy of the fourth amended complaint within 10 days of
the order. Nothing in the instant motion in any way relieves Plaintiff of the
obligation to serve Keith with the amended pleading, and any statement of
damages, as applicable, before seeking any default judgment.
 
The trial date remains vacated,
but the court will set an OSC re: Default and Default Judgment at the time of
the hearing.
 
Plaintiff
to give notice.
