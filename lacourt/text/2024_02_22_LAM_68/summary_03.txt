And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiffs, West Coast Add It Up Agency and Wi Miller, are seeking to vacate and enter a different judgment. They argue that the order sustaining the demurrer of Los Angeles County Metropolitan Authority without leave to amend was improper because they were not required to present a government claim. They also challenge the court's ruling on the statute of limitations, alleging that the court misinterpreted the law and relied on false information.

The court has instructed the clerk to forward the subject order to Judge Douglas Stern in Torrance, and for the plaintiffs to arrange for the hearing of the instant motion in this courtroom. The court has also ordered the clerk to give notice to all parties.
