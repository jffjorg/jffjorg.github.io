And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (Plaintiff) versus Carla Beatris Brown (Defendant). The Plaintiff filed a complaint on August 18, 2019, arising from a property damage subrogation claim resulting from an automobile accident on October 20, 2018. A settlement agreement was reached on January 6, 2021, for $2,626.41. On July 1, 2024, the Plaintiff filed a motion to enforce the settlement agreement and seek judgment against the Defendant in the amount of $9,377.44.

However, the Judge has ruled that the Plaintiff's Notice of Motion does not comply with California Rule of Court 3.110(b) and therefore, the Motion to Enforce Settlement is continued to September 19, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse, to allow the Plaintiff to provide proper notice to the Defendant. The Judge has ordered the Plaintiff to give notice of the ruling.
