 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff and his wife are the
owners of 12799 Norris Avenue, Sylmar, CA. Plaintiff and Defendant Nowzar
Mohebbi entered into an agreement for purchase of real estate. Plaintiff
alleges Defendant Mohebbi breached the agreement by failing to close the
transaction by the date certain and refusing to stipulate to the release of the
Earnest Money and by failing to provide any factual/legal basis for deviating
from the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement.
 
The operative complaint is the
First Amended Complaint filed on July 28, 2023. The FAC alleges (1) breach of
contract; (2) intentional misrepresentation; (3) negligent misrepresentation;
(4) declaratory relief; and (5) accounting. The only remaining cause of action
is the breach of contract action. The Court sustained demurrer without leave to
amend as to all other causes of action on October 26, 2023.
 
On November 13, 2023, Defendant
Mohebbi filed an answer to the FAC and a cross-complaint. Mohebbi's
cross-complaint alleges (1) breach of contract; (2) intentional
misrepresentation; (3) negligent misrepresentation; and (4) declaratory relief.
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Nowzar Mohebbi’s Motion to Compel responses to discovery was granted on May 15,
2024. The Court ordered Plaintiff and his counsel to pay to the Law Offices of
Sasoon Sardarian sanctions in the amount of $1635.00 no later than June 15,
2024. To date, Plaintiff and his counsel have not paid the sanctions. 
 
On July 8, 2024, Defendant/Cross-Complainant filed the
instant motion. 
 
As of August 13, 2024, no opposition has been filed.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Motion
for OSC re Contempt (CCP 1209)
A.                                       
Notice 
California
Rule of Court, Rule 3.1300(a) provides: [… all moving and supporting papers
must be served and filed in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure section
1005 and, when applicable, the statutes and rules providing electronic filing
and service.].  Rule 3.1300 (d) provides:
“proof of service of the moving papers must be filed no later than five court
days before the time appointed for the hearing.”  
            
Based on the lack of Proof of Service before the Court, it
is unclear whether Plaintiff is aware of this hearing.  The Court refers the moving party to review Newland
v. Superior Court, 40 Cal. App.608.  
 
II.        Conclusion 
 
Accordingly, the Motion for request to set an OSC re
Contempt (CCP 1209) is DENIED.  Moving
party is ordered to give notice of ruling.
