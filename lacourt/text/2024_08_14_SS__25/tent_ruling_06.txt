Merits
            
            On
September 11, 2023, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company
(“Plaintiff”) and Defendant Vanessa Marquez 
(“Defendant”) entered into a Settlement Agreement and Stipulation for
Dismissal ("Agreement") in which Defendant agreed to make monthly
payments to settle this matter. (Reese Decl. ¶ 2; Ex. A.) 
 
            The
Agreement includes the following language: “Defendant shall pay plaintiff $6,061.18
(the settlement amount) in full settlement of this action by as follows:
An initial payment of $2,761.18 shall be made by March 22, 2023, by defendant’s
insurance carrier, then, beginning March 15, 2023, monthly payments of $100.00
shall be made with all subsequent payments being due on the same day of each month
thereafter until the settlement amount is paid in full. . . If defendant fails
to make a timely payment, said failure is a material breach . . .” (Reese Decl.
¶ 2; Ex. A at ¶¶ 2-3.) The Agreement further includes, “The parties stipulate
that the court shall retain jurisdiction pursuant to CCP 664.6 to enforce this
agreement.” (Reese Decl. ¶ 2; Ex. A at ¶ 3.)
 
            Defendant
made monthly payments pursuant to the stipulation totaling $200.00; however,
Defendant has since defaulted on payments. (Reese Decl. ¶ 4.) Pursuant to the
terms of the Agreement, on or about February 20, 2024, Plaintiff mailed
Defendant a default letter regarding the missed payments. (Reese Decl. ¶ 5; Ex.
C.) Pursuant to the terms set forth in the Agreement, since payment was not
made within fourteen (14) days, Plaintiff is entitled to have any dismissal in
this action set aside and judgment entered, minus credit for payments received.
(Reese Decl. ¶ 6; Ex. C.) As of August 13, 2024, no opposition has been filed. 
 
            Thus, the
Court grants the Motion. 
 
III.       Conclusion 
 
            The Court
grants the Motion. 
 
            The
dismissal entered on September 12, 2023, is vacated and judgment is entered in
the amount of $3,465.00 ($6,061.18- $2,961.18+ $365[filing fees, service
process fee]) against Defendant Vanessa Marquez. 
 
            Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of ruling.
