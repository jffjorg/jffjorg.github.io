ANALYSIS
 
I.          Motion to Confirm Arbitration Award
A.                                       
Legal Standard 
            “Any party
to an arbitration in which an award has been made may petition the court to
confirm, correct or vacate the award.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.) Such a
petition must set forth the substance, or attach copies of: the arbitration
agreement, award, and any written opinion. (Id., § 1285.4.) It must be
served between 10 days and 4 years from the date the award was served on the
petitioner. (Id., §§ 1288 & 1288.4.) The other party may respond to
the petition. (Id., § 1285.2.) 
 
            “If a
petition or response under this chapter is duly served and filed, the court
shall confirm the award as made, whether rendered in this state or another
state, unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and
confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1286.) 
 
            The court
may not vacate or correct an award unless a petition or response requesting
that the award be vacated or corrected has been duly served and filed. (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 1286.4 & 1286.8.) 
 
            “If an
award is confirmed, judgment shall be entered in conformity therewith.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1287.4.) 
 
B.                                        
Discussion
            Here, the
Petition correctly attached copies of the written agreement with the provision
to arbitrate and the award. (Petition; Attachment 4(b) at p.9.) The award was
made and served on Petitioner on September 28, 2023. (Id.; Attachment
8(c) at p.2.) This Petition, which was filed on April 10, 2024, was therefore
timely filed. 
 
            No
response has been filed to this Petition. Therefore, the Court confirms the
award.

to Confirm the Contractual Arbitration Award is GRANTED.
