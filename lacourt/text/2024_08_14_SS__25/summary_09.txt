Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the Defendant, Nowzar Mohebbi, to set a hearing and order the Plaintiff, Gregory Todd, and his counsel to show cause why they should not be held in contempt of Court for failing to pay sanctions. The Defendant is also seeking additional monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,362.50. The motion was unopposed and the Judge denied it due to the lack of proof of service, which raises concerns about whether the Plaintiff is aware of the hearing. The Judge refers the moving party to a previous case, Newland v. Superior Court, for guidance on the proper procedure for serving and filing moving papers.
