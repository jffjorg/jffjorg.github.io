And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in response to Plaintiff John Oursland's unopposed motion to compel Defendant Joe Sherman's compliance with discovery requests. The Plaintiff had propounded document requests and form interrogatories on October 5, 2023, and the responses were due on November 9, 2023. However, the Defendant failed to respond, and the Plaintiff filed a motion to compel compliance. The Court finds that the Defendant has not provided any substantial justification for his failure to respond and therefore grants the Plaintiff's motion. The Defendant is ordered to serve initial responses to the discovery requests by February 26, 2024, and to pay discovery sanctions in the amount of $6,120.00 to the Plaintiff.
