And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the Special Motion to Strike the Cross-Complaint filed by Cross-Defendants Mendy Ezagui and Mayta Malamud. The motion was filed under California Anti-SLAPP Statute (C.C.P. §425.16) and alleged that the seventh cause of action in the Cross-Complaint, which is a claim for violation of the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (RFDCPA), is a strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP) and should be stricken.

The court found that the seventh cause of action is not based on protected conduct, as it is not related to the filing of the Complaint, but rather is a compulsory cross-complaint related to Cross-Defendants' alleged improper conduct with respect to the Property.

The court also found that Cross-Complainants have established a probability of prevailing on their seventh cause of action, as they have sufficiently alleged that Cross-Defendants are debt collectors and engaged in conduct that violates the RFDCPA. The court noted that the litigation privilege does not apply to the RFDCPA claims and that several decisions have opined that the litigation privilege does not apply to debt collection claims under the RFDCPA.

Therefore, the court has denied the Special Motion to Strike the Cross-Complaint and allowed the seventh cause of action to proceed.
