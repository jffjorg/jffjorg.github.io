And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has decided to strike the parties' memoranda and declarations due to their failure to follow California Rules of Court. The court has determined that the parties did not properly file their sealed documents, and instead attempted to seal the documents unilaterally. The court has also rejected the attempt to hold a non-public remote hearing. The court has ordered the parties to follow the proper procedure for filing sealed documents, and has reminded them that the court must provide notice to the public of contemplated closure and must hold a hearing and make findings before sealing records. The court has also emphasized the importance of public access to court proceedings and has cited relevant laws, including the California Rules of Court and the California Code of Civil Procedure.
