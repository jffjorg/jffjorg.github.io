And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is about a case between Bank Otkritie Financial Corp. (the Bank) and Aleksandr Blyumkin. The Bank is seeking a right to attach order, temporary protective order, and writ of attachment to prevent Blyumkin from dissipating assets pending a final decision on the Bank's request. The Bank is seeking to recognize and enforce a foreign judgment from a Moscow court for over US$2.7 million, which Blyumkin allegedly owes due to a loan default. The Bank has provided evidence supporting the four elements required to obtain a right to attach order under California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) sec. 483.010. Blyumkin failed to file opposition to the application, and the Court grants the application.
