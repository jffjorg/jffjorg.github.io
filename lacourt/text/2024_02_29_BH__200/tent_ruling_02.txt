TENTATIVE RULING
ON APPLICATION OF PLAINTIFF FOR RIGHT TO ATTACH ORDER, TEMPORARY PROTECTIVE
ORDER AND WRIT OF ATTACHMENT 
Bank Otkritie
Financial Corp. v. Aleksandr Blyumkin, Case No. 21STCP03455
Hearing Date:
February 29, 2024, 8:30 a.m. 
 
          On
February 5, 2024, Bank filed this application. Bank provides the necessary evidence
under Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) sec. 484.090 supporting the four elements
that must be proven to obtain a right to attach order under CCP sec. 483.010: 
 
1. Bank’s claim is contractual in nature. 
2. The claim is for a readily ascertainable sum greater
than $500. 
3. Bank’s claim is unsecured by real property. 
4. Bank’s claim arises out of conduct by Blyumkin of a
business, as opposed to “personal, family or household purposes.” 
 
          In
summary, this matter arises out of the alleged default on a loan by Bank’s
predecessor to a business, which Blyumkin agreed to as Chairman of the Board, for
business purposes, and that he personally guaranteed. 
          The
amount outstanding is contended to be over US$2.7 million based on current
exchange rates with the Russian ruble. By this action, Bank requests this Court
recognize and enforce the judgment of a Moscow court that this amount is owed
by Blyumkin. 
          Bank
argues that its claim has “probable validity” (as defined by CCP sec. 481.190) for
purposes of CCP sec. 484.030 in that it meets the requirements under CCP secs.
1715 and 1718 for recognition of a foreign judgment. The burden is shifted to
Blyumkin to assert any applicable defenses under CCP sec. 1716. 
          Bank
seeks a right to attach order to prevent Blyumkin dissipating assets pending
this Court making a final decision on Bank’s request, contending it faces
serious consequences without provisional relief. Specifically, as required by CCP
sec. 484.020, Bank seeks to attach the following assets of Blyumkin: certain
residential real property, bank accounts, as well as his shares in Petroteq
Energy, Inc. 
          Blyumkin
had until five court days before the hearing to file opposition, under CCP sec.
484.060(a) and failed to do so. Blyumkin has not filed any opposition.           
 
          For these
reasons, the Court grants the application.
