And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions: one to extend the time for trial and one to bifurcate the trial. The five-year deadline for the petition to be tried is May 9, 2024, and both parties have indicated they are ready for trial before that date. The judge has scheduled the trial to begin on March 18, 2024, and has ordered the parties to file joint witness and exhibit lists and trial briefs by March 11, 2024.

As for the motion to bifurcate the trial, the judge has denied it. The judge believes that bifurcation would not promote efficiency in handling the trial and that the issues of liability and damages are intertwined. The judge also notes that bifurcation would not avoid the need for forensic accountants to testify, but rather would require them to testify twice. The judge is open to hearing proposals on the order of proof at trial, however, to minimize the need for expert testimony.
