BACKGROUND
 
On March 15, 2023, Plaintiff
Rebecca Martens (“Plaintiff”) filed the original Complaint in this action (“the
1136 action”) against Defendants David M. Alessi, M.D. (“Alessi M.D.”); David
M. Alessi, M.D., P.C. (“Alessi, M.D., P.C.”) ; and Alessi Institute for Facial
Plastic Surgery, for injuries arising from Defendants’ alleged medical
malpractice.
 
On July 5, 2023, Defendants David
M. Alessi, M.D., PC dba Alessi Institute for Facial Plastic Surgery and David
M. Alessi, M.D. answered the Complaint.
 
The original Complaint sought the
following:
 
1. General damages according to
proof; 
 
2. Loss of earnings according to
proof; 
 
3. All medical and incidental
expenses according to proof; 
 
4. Such other and further relief
as the court deems proper.
 
(See Complaint at prayer.)
 
            On
September 25, 2023, at Plaintiff’s request, the Court dismissed Defendant
Alessi Institute for Facial Plastic Surgery. 

 
            On October
26, 2023, Plaintiff filed another “Complaint” that is not labeled “First
Amended Complaint” nor is it filed pursuant to Court Order or by stipulation of
the parties.  In addition to removing all
references to the now-dismissed Defendant Alessi Institute for Facial Plastic
Surgery, the October 26th Complaint inserts a new paragraph 11 and
16, alters the other substantive allegations of paragraphs 12-15, and changes
the Prayer to now request “Punitive damages in the sum of $1,500,000.00.”  (See Complaint, Oct. 26, 2023.)
 
            Also on
October 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed an identical Complaint in a separate action,
23SMCV05054 (“the 5054 action”).
 
            On January
17, 2024, the parties filed a stipulation to strike the 16th paragraph and the
4th paragraph of the prayer seeking punitive damages, which the Court rejected,
on the basis that the stipulation was erroneously filed in the 1136 action
instead of the 5054 action.
 
            On January
19, 2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of related case, which the Court granted and
related the cases on February 8, 2024.
 
            On April
15, 2024, at Plaintiff’s request, the clerk entered default against Defendants
Alessi, M.D. and Alessi, M.D., P.C. in the related 5054 action.  
 
            On June 27,
2024, the parties stipulated to set aside the defaults entered in the 5054
action, to deem the answer filed in the 1136 action also an answer in the 5054
action, to strike the 16th paragraph of the Complaint and the
request for punitive damages in the prayer of the complaint in the 5054 action,
and to consolidate the two related actions for all purposes, which the Court
granted on August 2, 2024.
 
            On July 17,
2024, Plaintiff’s counsel moved to be relieved as counsel, which the Court
granted on August 8, 2024.  (Minute
Order, Aug. 8, 2024.)  Per the Order,
counsel was to remain counsel of record until service of the order was
effectuated on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the action
and proof of such service was filed with the Court.
 
            Plaintiff
subsequently moved to vacate the parties’ June 27 stipulation, either in total
or in part, which the Court denied on October 29, 2024.  (See Minute Order, Oct. 29, 2024.)
 
            Plaintiff
now moves to for additional time to prepare for the final status conference
scheduled for October 11 and for additional time to prepare responses to the
motions in limine.  The motion is
unopposed.
 
ANALYSIS
 
                         
I.         
SERVICE OF PLAINTIFF’S MOTION
 
As a threshold matter, Code of Civil Procedure section 1005 requires
that a notice of motion and supporting papers be served at least 16 court days
before the hearing.  (Code Civ. Proc.,§
1005, subd. (b).)
 
Here, the Court finds Plaintiff did not provide adequate notice.  To begin, the hearing date listed on the face
of the notice is October 9, 2024, yet the hearing was actually scheduled for
November 20, 2024.
 
 Further, Plaintiff’s proof of
service is faulty.  The proof of service
provides that on September 24, 2024, Merik Migliore electronically served the
motion, which itself is dated and signed on October 6, 2024, on Plaintiff
Rebecca Martens and on Defendant David M. Alessi, M.D. “on behalf of Adam R
James, Rodney G Tomlinson, Rebecca Martens.” 

 
The Court suspects what Plaintiff intends to convey by the proof of
service is that Merik Migliore served attorneys Adam R. James and Rodney G
Tomlinson on behalf of Defendant David M. Alessi, M.D.  
 
However, the proof of service does not indicate any service was made
on Defendant Alessi, M.D., P.C. at all, nor does it accurately reflect that
service was made on defense counsel on behalf of either Defendant.  
 
Therefore, Plaintiff has not demonstrated compliance with the notice
requirements of Section 1005.
 
                       
II.         
REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL TIME TO PREPARE FOR THE
FINAL STATUS CONFERENCE AND PREPARE RESPONSES TO THE MOTIONS IN LIMINE
 
Substantively, Plaintiff requests a 60-day extension from the
then-final status conference date of October 11, 2024 in order to prepare documents
in advance of the final status conference, draft responses to the 11 motions in
limine, and coordinate with experts to finalize testimony.
 
At the October 11th  Final Status Conference, the Court continued
the Final Status Conference to March 7, 2025 and continued the trial to March
24, 2025.
 
Therefore, the Court finds the motion to be moot.
 
CONCLUSION
 
            For the foregoing reasons, the Court
denies Plaintiff’s motion in its entirety for improper notice and mootness.  
 
            The Clerk of the Court shall provide
notice of the Court’s ruling.
