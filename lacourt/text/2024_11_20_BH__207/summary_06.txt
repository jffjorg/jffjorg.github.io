And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a motion filed by Justin J. Eballar, counsel for plaintiff Antoinette Holmes, seeking to be relieved as counsel due to continued difficulties in communication. The motion is unopposed. The court finds that the motion is substantively proper as it is based on a valid reason for withdrawal under Rule 1.16(b)(4) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. However, the court finds the motion to be procedurally defective because the required forms were not properly served on the client and other parties who have appeared in the action. The court continues the hearing to January 14, 2025, to enable counsel to properly serve the required forms and orders the counsel to provide notice of the court's ruling and the continued hearing date.
