And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for additional time to prepare for the final status conference and responses to motions in limine. The motion was unopposed, but the judge found that the plaintiff did not provide adequate notice of the motion, violating Code of Civil Procedure section 1005. Additionally, the judge ruled that the motion was moot because the final status conference had already been continued to March 7, 2025, and the trial to March 24, 2025. The judge granted the motion to be relieved as counsel on August 8, 2024, and denied the motion to vacate the stipulation on October 29, 2024.
