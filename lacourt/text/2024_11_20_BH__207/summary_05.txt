And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to enforce a settlement agreement between Precise General Contractor, Inc. and JRM Construction West, LLC. The settlement agreement was executed on August 29, 2023, and provides for the payment of $102,500 to Precise General Contractor, Inc. in exchange for dismissing the action against JRM Construction West, LLC. Chapter 4 Corp., a non-party to the settlement agreement, is seeking to enforce the agreement and have the action against it dismissed. The court finds that Chapter 4 Corp. is not a party to the settlement agreement and does not have standing to enforce it. The court also finds that the language in the settlement agreement does not evidence an intent to benefit Chapter 4 Corp. or release claims against it. Therefore, the court denies Chapter 4 Corp.'s motion to enforce the settlement agreement.
