The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Randy Chang of The Chang Firm, counsel for Plaintiff Nadia Heshmati. The motion was filed due to a "fatal breakdown in communication" between Counsel and Plaintiff. The court finds that there has been an irreparable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship and that the motion is substantively proper. However, the court also finds that the motion is procedurally defective due to the failure to serve required forms on all parties. The court has continued the hearing to January 15, 2025, at which time Counsel must properly serve the required forms. The court has also continued the Case Management Conference from January 7, 2025, to January 15, 2025, and ordered all parties to comply with California Rules of Court regarding Initial and Further Case Management Conferences.
