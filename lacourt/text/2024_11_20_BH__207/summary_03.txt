And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge is considering a motion filed by Defendant Miguel Anaya for leave to file a cross-complaint against a new party, Jonati Yedidsion, who is alleged to have caused a multi-vehicle motor collision. The collision occurred on April 28, 2023, and was the subject of a lawsuit filed by Plaintiff Sophia Kraft against Anaya. Later, Plaintiff Ashlee Zamora filed a separate lawsuit against Anaya. Anaya claims that he only recently learned of Yedidsion's involvement in the collision through depositions taken in August 2024, and is seeking to file the cross-complaint against Yedidsion. The opposing parties, Salcido and Zamora, argue that Anaya is trying to delay the trial and that he should have filed the cross-complaint earlier. The Judge grants Anaya's motion, finding that he did not act in bad faith and that the liberal policy of granting leave to avoid forfeiture of claims applies in this case. The Judge also vacates the current trial date and schedules a new trial readiness conference for March 2025.
