[1] Defendant requests that Plaintiff’s opposition be
stricken on this basis.  The Court
declines to strike Plaintiff’s entire opposition, especially in light of
Plaintiff’s pro per status, and the Court will consider Plaintiff’s
legal arguments, but the Court does note that Plaintiff has neither provided
his own evidence nor disputed any of Defendant’s evidence.
