Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion for summary judgment in favor of the defendants, Alliance Property Management, Inc. and Great for Six, LLC, on the grounds that the plaintiff, David Schlosberg, is collaterally estopped from re-litigating the issue of the validity of the three-day notice that was previously litigated in the unlawful detainer action. The court finds that the defendants have met their burden of showing that the issue was previously decided in the unlawful detainer action and that the plaintiff has not raised any triable issue of material fact that would prevent summary judgment.
