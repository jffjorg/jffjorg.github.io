Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Perlman's motion to appoint a receiver to manage the Malibu Road Homeowners Association (HOA). Perlman had argued that the HOA was mismanaged and that there was a risk that the second floor landing would be lost or damaged. However, the judge found that the evidence presented by Perlman did not support the drastic remedy of appointing a receiver.

The judge noted that the HOA has a majority interest in the association and that the Valeros have comixed HOA funds with their own. The judge also found that the HOA has failed to make timely mortgage payments or maintain flood insurance. However, the judge did not find sufficient evidence to support Perlman's allegations of financial misconduct.

The judge cited several legal precedents, including Maggiora v. Palo Alto Inn, Inc. and Southern California Sunbelt Developers, Inc. v. Banyan Limited Partnership, in support of its decision. The judge also noted that the official act of recordation and the common use of a notary public in the execution of documents assure their reliability.

The judge ordered that Perlman provide notice of the ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
