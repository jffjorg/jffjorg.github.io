And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for leave to amend the cross-complaint to include new cross-defendants, Henry Ramirez and J&S Air Conditioning. The proposed amendment is based on new information discovered during discovery, which reveals that these parties may be liable for some or all of the water damage to the property. The judge finds that granting the amendment will not prejudice the opposing party and will promote judicial economy. The motion is granted, and the trial date is set for April 15, 2024.
