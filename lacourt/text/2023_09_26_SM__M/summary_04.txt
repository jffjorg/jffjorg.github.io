## Case Summary: D'Ecoto West Inc. v. Portnoy, et al. (20SMCV01842)

**Case Number:** 20SMCV01842
**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023
**Dept:** M

**Parties:**
* **Plaintiff:** D'Ecoto West Inc.
* **Defendants/Cross-Complainants:** Caryl Portnoy and Portnoy-Worth Community Property Trust
* **Newly Proposed Cross-Defendants:** Henry Ramirez and J&S Air Conditioning

**Facts:**

* D'Ecoto West Inc. is suing the Portnoy entities.
* The Portnoy entities filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint (FAC) against various parties.
* Henry Ramirez and J&S Air Conditioning were initially dismissed without prejudice as cross-defendants.
* During Ramirez's deposition, new information emerged suggesting DWI might attribute some liability for water damage to Ramirez and/or J&S Air Conditioning.

**Motion:**

* The Portnoy entities filed a Motion for Leave to Amend to add Ramirez and J&S Air Conditioning as cross-defendants in a Second Amended Cross-Complaint (SACC).

**Legal Standard:**

*  Motions for leave to amend pleadings are granted at the court's discretion.
*  Courts generally favor granting leave to amend to resolve all disputes between parties unless there's prejudice to the opposing party.
*  Factors considered include:
    *  Dilatory tactics by the moving party.
    *  Prejudice to the opposing party (e.g., trial delay, loss of evidence, increased expense).

**Analysis:**

* The court found the proposed amendment is supported by newly discovered information and promoting judicial economy.
* There is ample time for discovery regarding the newly added cross-defendants before the April 15, 2024 trial date.
* No opposition to the motion was filed.

**Ruling:**

* The court GRANTED the motion for leave to amend.



**English Summary:**

The judge granted the Portnoy entities' request to amend their cross-complaint. They want to add Henry Ramirez and J&S Air Conditioning as cross-defendants because they learned during discovery that D'Ecoto West Inc. might hold those parties partially responsible for the water damage to the property.  The judge found that this amendment is justified because it is based on new information, and it will not unfairly delay the trial or harm the other parties involved.
