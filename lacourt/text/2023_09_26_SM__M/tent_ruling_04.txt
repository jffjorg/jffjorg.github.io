Inc. v. Portnoy, et al.
CASE NO.:                20SMCV01842
MOTION:                  Motion
for Leave to Amend
HEARING DATE:   9/26/2023

 
Legal
Standard
 
If a party
wishes to amend a pleading after an answer has been filed, or after a demurrer
has been filed and after the hearing on the demurrer, or if he or she has
already amended the pleading as a matter of course, the party must obtain permission
from the court before amendment. (CCP §§ 473(a)(1), 576.) 
 
Motions
for leave to amend the pleadings are directed to the sound discretion of the
court. “The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be
proper, allow a party to amend any pleading . . . .” (CCP § 473(a)(1); see CCP
§ 576.) Policy favors liberally granting leave to amend so that all disputed
matters between the parties may be resolved. (See Howard v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422,
1428.) Absent prejudice to the adverse party, the court may permit amendments
to the complaint “at any stage of the proceedings, up to and including trial.”
(Atkinson v. Elk Corp.
(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761 [internal quotes omitted].) Where leave is
sought to add entirely new claims, the court may grant leave to amend if the
new claims are based on the same general set of facts, and the amendment will
not prejudice the opposing party. (Austin
v. Massachusetts Bonding & Ins. Co. (1961) 56 Cal.2d 596, 600-602; Glaser v. Meyers (1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 770, 777 [holding
trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting amendment of complaint,
which originally alleged constructive eviction, to allege retaliatory eviction
where the new claim was based on the same general set of facts].)
 
Although
denial is rarely justified, a judge has discretion to deny leave to amend if
the party seeking the amendment has been dilatory, and the delay has prejudiced
the opposing party. (Morgan v. Superior
Court (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530; Hirsa v. Superior Court
(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490). An opposing party is prejudiced where the
amendment would necessitate a trial delay along with a loss of critical
evidence, added preparation expense, increased burden of discovery, etc. (Magpali
v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488 [leave properly
denied where plaintiff sought leave on the eve of trial, nearly two years after
the complaint was originally filed and gave no explanation for the delay which
prejudiced defendant who did not discover or depose many of the witnesses who would
support the new allegations and had not marshaled evidence in opposition of the
new allegations].)
 
Procedurally,
a motion for leave to amend must state with particularity what allegations are
to be amended. Namely, it must state what allegations in the previous pleading
are proposed to be deleted and/or added, if any, and where, by page, paragraph,
and line number. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(a)(2)-(3).) The motion must be accompanied
by a declaration specifying: (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the
amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the
amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the reasons why the request for
amendment was not made earlier. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(b).) The motion must also be
accompanied by the proposed amended pleading, numbered to differentiate it from
the prior pleadings or amendments. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(a)(1).) It is within the
court’s discretion to require compliance with Rule 3.1324 before granting leave
to amend. (Hataishi v. First American Home Buyers Protection Corp. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 1454, 1469.)
 
Analysis
 
Defendants/Cross-Complainants
Caryl Portnoy and Portnoy-Worth Community Property Trust move for leave to file
a Second Amended Cross-Complaint. A copy of the proposed Second Amended
Cross-Complaint (SACC) is provided.
 
Counsel
provides a declaration showing the effect of the proposed amendments and their
recent discovery. The general effect of the proposed SACC is to rename Henry
Ramirez as a cross defendant, and to name J&S Air Conditioning as a
cross-defendant. Between July 20, 2022, and now, certain cross-defendants in
the First Amended Cross-Complaint were dismissed without prejudice, including
Henry Ramirez. These cross-defendants were dismissed due to Cross Complainants’
belief, based on the discovery that had been conducted thus far, that those
persons and entities were not liable for the damage sustained to the Property. Based
on the questions asked of Ramirez at deposition, as well as discussions with
counsel for the parties following the deposition, counsel became aware that DWI
would attribute some or all of its liability for water damage to the Property
to Henry Ramirez and/or J&S Air Conditioning. As such, the interests of
justice support amendment to promote judicial economy.
 
Further,
amendment to include these parties as cross-defendants will not prejudice DWI
or other named cross-defendants. Trial is set for April 15, 2024. Ramirez’s
deposition has already been taken and there remains ample time in discovery to
conduct a deposition of a representative of J&S Air Conditioning. Further,
no opposition is submitted.
 
Accordingly,
the motion is GRANTED.
