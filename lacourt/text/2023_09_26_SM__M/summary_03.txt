Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for attorneys' fees incurred in this action. The defendant, National Mortgage Resources (NMR), argued that it was the prevailing party in the consolidated action, but the judge found that NMR failed to demonstrate that it was the prevailing party despite section 1717(b)(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that there shall be no prevailing party where an action has been voluntarily dismissed. The judge noted that NMR pointed to no authority that the Court may determine whether a voluntary dismissal was "truly voluntary" and that the case of Calvo Fisher & Jacob LLP v. Lujan (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 608, 626 was inapposite. The judge also found that the motion was denied due to the Court's lack of discretion to ignore section 1717(b)(2)'s command that there is "no prevailing party" in this matter.
