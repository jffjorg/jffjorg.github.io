Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for attorneys' fees incurred in this action. The defendant, National Mortgage Resources (NMR), argued that it was the prevailing party in the consolidated action, but the judge found that NMR failed to demonstrate that it was the prevailing party despite section 1717(b)(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that there shall be no prevailing party where an action has been voluntarily dismissed. The judge noted that NMR pointed to no authority that the Court may determine whether a voluntary dismissal was "truly voluntary" and that the case of Calvo Fisher & Jacob LLP v. Lujan (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 608, 626 was inapposite. The judge also found that the motion was denied due to the Court's lack of discretion to ignore section 1717(b)(2)'s command that there is "no prevailing party" in this matter.

## English Summary

The judge has ruled that National Mortgage Resources (NMR) is not the prevailing party in this case, and therefore is not entitled to attorney's fees.

 NMR argued that the plaintiffs' voluntary dismissal of the case should not prevent them from receiving fees.  However, the judge cited a statute (CCP § 1717(b)(2)) that states there is no prevailing party when an action is voluntarily dismissed. The judge rejected NMR's attempts to argue that the dismissal wasn't truly voluntary and found that NMR's arguments were not supported by relevant legal precedent.  As a result, NMR's motion for attorney's fees was denied.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion for attorneys' fees. The defendant, National Mortgage Resources, had sought an award of $266,506.50 in attorneys' fees, arguing that it was the prevailing party in the consolidated action. However, the judge found that the plaintiffs had voluntarily dismissed the action without prejudice, which meant that there was no prevailing party under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1717(b)(2). The judge noted that the defendant had cited no authority to support its claim that the dismissal was not truly voluntary, and that the court may not ignore the statutory provision regarding voluntary dismissal. The judge concluded that the motion was denied because there was no prevailing party in the matter.
