```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has considered the motion for leave to amend the complaint and has granted the motion. The proposed Fourth Amended Complaint (4AC) deletes two subparagraphs in the Breach of Contract Claim and replaces them with two new subparagraphs alleging an additional factual basis for the breach of written lease claim. The new claims relate to the failure of the defendants to make the premises compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The Court finds that while there was a substantial delay in bringing this issue to the Court's attention, the delay is not significantly prejudicial and does not justify denial of leave to amend. The motion for leave to amend is granted, and the 4AC shall be filed within three court days.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the plaintiff, Cienega Ventures LLC, to amend its complaint to add claims related to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant, 730 N. La Cienega LLC, et al., breached the lease by failing to make the premises ADA compliant, and that the plaintiff did not know about this issue until recently.

The court has found that the defendant has demonstrated that the plaintiff likely knew about the ADA compliance issue by June or July 2022, but the plaintiff did not bring this issue to the court's attention until August 2023. The court has also found that the delay in bringing this issue has caused some prejudice to the defendant, including increased discovery costs.

However, the court has concluded that the prejudice is not substantial and has granted the motion for leave to amend. The court has ordered the plaintiff to file the amended complaint within three court days.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to amend their complaint to include additional breach of contract claims related to the defendant's alleged failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The plaintiff owns a commercial building and leased it to the defendants, who allegedly breached the lease by failing to pay rent, maintain the premises, and comply with ADA requirements. The defendants opposed the amendment, arguing that the plaintiff had delayed in filing the amendment and that it would be prejudicial. However, the judge found that any delay did not appear to be significantly prejudicial, as the defendants had already been questioned about the ADA-compliant bathrooms during prior depositions. The judge also found that the defendants' arguments about the amendment being deficient as a matter of law were not relevant to the motion for leave to amend. Therefore, the judge granted the motion, allowing the plaintiff to file a Fourth Amended Complaint within three court days.

English text:
The case is Cienega Ventures LLC v. 730 N. La Cienega LLC et al., with a hearing date of September 26, 2023. The plaintiff, Cienega Ventures LLC, is seeking leave to file a Fourth Amended Complaint (4AC) against the defendants, 730 N. La Cienega LLC, Koi LP, and Haque. The plaintiff's principal, Perry, and the defendants' counsel, Derby, are mentioned in the document. The case concerns a commercial building located at 730 North La Cienega Boulevard in Los Angeles, California.

In 2002, Haque assumed a lease with the plaintiff's predecessor to operate Koi restaurant on the premises. The lease was later assigned to Koi LP and was set to expire in 2012. In 2012, 730 North and the plaintiff entered into a new lease, which the defendants allegedly breached by failing to pay rent, maintain the premises, provide insurance details, and give notice before subleasing.

The plaintiff discovered potential Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) non-compliance in April/May 2023 and is now seeking to add this issue to the complaint. The plaintiff argues that they were not previously aware of the issue and that the defendants were obligated to make the premises compliant with the ADA under the lease. The defendants argue that the plaintiff unreasonably delayed in bringing this issue to the court's attention and that the ADA-related claim is deficient as a matter of law.

The court finds that there is insufficient substantial prejudice to justify denial of leave to amend, despite any delay on the plaintiff's part. Accordingly, the motion for leave to amend is granted, and the 4AC must be filed within three court days.
