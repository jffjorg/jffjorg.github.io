And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has considered the motion for leave to amend the complaint and has granted the motion. The proposed Fourth Amended Complaint (4AC) deletes two subparagraphs in the Breach of Contract Claim and replaces them with two new subparagraphs alleging an additional factual basis for the breach of written lease claim. The new claims relate to the failure of the defendants to make the premises compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The Court finds that while there was a substantial delay in bringing this issue to the Court's attention, the delay is not significantly prejudicial and does not justify denial of leave to amend. The motion for leave to amend is granted, and the 4AC shall be filed within three court days.
