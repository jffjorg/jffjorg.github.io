And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for reconsideration filed by Plaintiff Michael Sanchez. The motion seeks to reconsider the court's orders granting Sanchez's counsel's Motion to Withdraw and the Lawyer Defendants' Motion for Attorneys' Fees. The judge finds that the motion fails for several reasons.

First, the judge notes that Sanchez cites Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 59(e), which is inapplicable to these proceedings. The judge directs Sanchez to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1008, which provides that a motion for reconsideration must be made within 10 days after service of the notice of entry of the order. The judge finds that Sanchez's motion was filed more than 10 days after the order relieving Waddington as counsel, and therefore cannot be granted.

The judge also finds that Sanchez's declaration, which is the basis for his motion, is "awash with facts that are not relevant to the attorneys' fees motion." The judge notes that Sanchez fails to address any facts pertaining to the issues raised in the motion, and instead focuses on a long list of alleged malpractice and misconduct by Waddington.

The judge concludes that Sanchez has not shown any "new or different" facts, circumstances, or law that were unavailable to him when he opposed the attorneys' fees motion. Therefore, the motion for reconsideration is denied.

## English Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Michael Sanchez's motion for reconsideration of two previous orders: the granting of his former attorney's Motion to Withdraw and the granting of Defendants' Motion for Attorneys' Fees. 

The judge explains that motions for reconsideration in California are only granted under specific circumstances, such as when new evidence comes to light or when there was a mistake in the original ruling. The judge finds that Plaintiff's motion does not meet these criteria because it relies on allegations of past malpractice by his former attorney and disputes the underlying Anti-SLAPP motion ruling. These arguments, the judge states, were not relevant to the attorneys' fees motion and do not present any new information. 


Therefore, the judge denies the motion for reconsideration.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Michael Sanchez, has moved for reconsideration of the court's orders granting his counsel's motion to withdraw and the lawyer defendants' motion for attorneys' fees. The court has denied the motion for reconsideration for several reasons.

Firstly, the court notes that the plaintiff's citation to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (FRCP) Rule 59(e) is inapplicable to these proceedings. Instead, the court must consider California Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, which provides that a motion for reconsideration must be made within 10 days after service of the notice of entry of the order. The plaintiff's motion was filed and served more than 10 days after the order relieving Mr. Waddington as counsel, and therefore cannot be granted.

Secondly, the court finds that the plaintiff's declaration proffered new or different facts, circumstances, or law to justify reconsideration. However, the declaration is awash with facts that are not relevant to the attorneys' fees motion, and the plaintiff does not address any facts pertaining to issues raised in the motion. The court concludes that the motion for reconsideration cannot be granted because the plaintiff has not demonstrated that newly discovered evidence could not, with reasonable diligence, have previously discovered and produced.

Finally, the court notes that even if the court assumes the truth of the plaintiff's allegations of malpractice against Mr. Waddington and error in the underlying Anti-SLAPP motions, the plaintiff has not cited any "new or different" facts, circumstances, or law that were unavailable to him when he opposed the attorneys' fees motion. Therefore, the motion for reconsideration cannot be granted.

The Judge found that Plaintiff's motion was untimely and lacked sufficient grounds for reconsideration. While Plaintiff alleged malpractice by Mr. Waddington and errors in the Anti-SLAPP motions, the Judge determined that these claims did not present new or different facts that were unavailable to Plaintiff when he initially opposed the orders. 

Therefore, the Judge denied Plaintiff's request to overturn the previous rulings.

The Plaintiff's allegations of malpractice by his former counsel and errors in the underlying Anti-SLAPP motions were deemed irrelevant to the motion for reconsideration. Therefore, the motion for reconsideration is denied.
