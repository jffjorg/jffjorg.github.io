And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for reconsideration filed by Plaintiff Michael Sanchez. The motion seeks to reconsider the court's orders granting Sanchez's counsel's Motion to Withdraw and the Lawyer Defendants' Motion for Attorneys' Fees. The judge finds that the motion fails for several reasons.

First, the judge notes that Sanchez cites Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 59(e), which is inapplicable to these proceedings. The judge directs Sanchez to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1008, which provides that a motion for reconsideration must be made within 10 days after service of the notice of entry of the order. The judge finds that Sanchez's motion was filed more than 10 days after the order relieving Waddington as counsel, and therefore cannot be granted.

The judge also finds that Sanchez's declaration, which is the basis for his motion, is "awash with facts that are not relevant to the attorneys' fees motion." The judge notes that Sanchez fails to address any facts pertaining to the issues raised in the motion, and instead focuses on a long list of alleged malpractice and misconduct by Waddington.

The judge concludes that Sanchez has not shown any "new or different" facts, circumstances, or law that were unavailable to him when he opposed the attorneys' fees motion. Therefore, the motion for reconsideration is denied.
