to Consolidate
HEARING DATE:   9/14/2023

 
Legal
Standard
 
The trial
court is authorized to consolidate pending “actions involving a common question
of law or fact…,” so as to “avoid unnecessary costs or delay.” (CCP § 1048(a).)
The decision to consolidate pending actions is a matter wholly committed to the
trial court’s discretion. (Nat’l Elec. Supply Co. v. Mt. Diablo Unified Sch.
Dist.¿(1960) 187 Cal. App. 2d 418, 421.) LASC Local Rule 3.3(g)(1) further
directs that consolidation cannot occur until “[a] motion to consolidate two or
more cases [is] noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in different
departments, have been related into a single department, or if the cases were
already assigned to that department.”¿¿ 
¿ 
Under
California Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a)(1), a notice of motion to consolidate
must: (A) List all named parties in each case, the names of those who have
appeared, and the names of their respective attorneys of record; (B) Contain
the captions of all the cases sought to be consolidated, with the lowest
numbered case shown first; and (C) Be filed in each case sought to be
consolidated. (2) The motion to consolidate: (A) Is deemed a single motion for
the purpose of determining the appropriate filing fee, but memorandums,
declarations, and other supporting papers must be filed only in the lowest
numbered case; (B) Must be served on all attorneys of record and all
non-represented parties in all of the cases sought to be consolidated; and (C)
Must have a proof of service filed as part of the motion. Under rule 3.350(b),
“[u]nless¿otherwise provided in the order granting the motion to consolidate,
the lowest numbered case in the consolidated case in the lead case.”¿ 
 
Analysis
 
Defendants
GS Redwood Property, LLC, and Greystar California, Inc. move to consolidate
case numbers 23STLC00997 and 20SMCV01023, both pending in the Los Angeles
Superior Court, with case number 20SMCV01023 as the lead case. (CCP §§ 402,
403, 1048; RC Rule 3.350.) Defendants request consolidation for the purposes of
both discovery and trial. Defendant argues that there is good cause for the
consolidation, as both plaintiffs are represented by the same law firm, allege
they were tenants in the same apartment building, owned by the same defendants,
have identified the same liability witnesses from Defendants, utilized the same
experts and sustained the same injuries from the same conditions.
 
LASC Local
Rule 3.3(g) requires both cases to be related into a single department or
assigned to a single department prior to consolidation. Defendants filed
Notices of Related Case in both actions, but the Court deemed the matters not
related. As such, case 23STLC00997 is not currently assigned to this
department. Therefore, consolidation cannot occur. 
 
Accordingly,
the motion is DENIED.
