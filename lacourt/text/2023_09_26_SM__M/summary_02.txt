And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion to consolidate the cases 20SMCV01023 and 23STLC00997, pending in the Los Angeles Superior Court. The defendants, GS Redwood Property, LLC, and Greystar California, Inc., had requested consolidation for the purposes of both discovery and trial, arguing that there was good cause for the consolidation due to the common questions of law and fact between the two cases. However, the judge noted that the cases were not currently assigned to the same department, as required by LASC Local Rule 3.3(g)(1), and therefore consolidation cannot occur.

## English Summary

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying a motion to consolidate two cases: 20SMCV01023 and 23STLC00997. Both cases involve claims against the same defendants by tenants in the same apartment building, represented by the same law firm.  

Although the defendants argued consolidation was necessary for efficiency, the judge found that, according to local court rules, the cases must be assigned to the same department before consolidation can occur.  The judge determined that this requirement had not been met. Therefore, the motion to consolidate is denied.

## Tentative Ruling Summary: Klenk v. Behringer Harvard Redwood LLC, et al.

**Case Number:** 20SMCV01023
**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023
**Dept:** M

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Klenk 
* **Defendants:** GS Redwood Property, LLC, Greystar California, Inc., Behringer Harvard Redwood LLC, et al. 

**Summary:**

This case involves two separate lawsuits, 23STLC00997 and 20SMCV01023, filed by tenants who allege they suffered injuries due to similar conditions in the same apartment building owned by the defendants.  GS Redwood Property, LLC, and Greystar California, Inc. (Defendants) requested the court consolidate both cases for discovery and trial.

**Judge's Reasoning:**

The judge acknowledged the legal standard for consolidation, citing CCP § 1048(a) and LASC Local Rule 3.3(g)(1).  However, the judge denied the motion due to procedural requirements.  

Even though the Defendants filed Notices of Related Case, the court did not deem the matters related.  As a result, case 23STLC00997 is not currently assigned to the same department as 20SMCV01023.

**Key Points:**

* Consolidation is allowed for cases with common questions of law or fact to avoid unnecessary costs and delays.
*  LASC Local Rule 3.3(g)(1) requires related cases to be in the same department before consolidation.
* The court denied the motion to consolidate because the cases were not deemed related.
