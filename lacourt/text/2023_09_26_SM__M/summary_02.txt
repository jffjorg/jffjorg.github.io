And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion to consolidate the cases 20SMCV01023 and 23STLC00997, pending in the Los Angeles Superior Court. The defendants, GS Redwood Property, LLC, and Greystar California, Inc., had requested consolidation for the purposes of both discovery and trial, arguing that there was good cause for the consolidation due to the common questions of law and fact between the two cases. However, the judge noted that the cases were not currently assigned to the same department, as required by LASC Local Rule 3.3(g)(1), and therefore consolidation cannot occur.
