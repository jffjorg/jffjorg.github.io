to the Second Amended Complaint 
HEARING DATE:   9/26/2023

 
Legal
Standard
 
            A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not
the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (CCP §§
430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate
facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the claim
against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie
(1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading,
or the construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore Land Co. v. Petersen
(1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations omitted.)
 
            “Liberality in permitting amendment
is the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to
show in what manner plaintiff can amend the complaint,
and how that amendment will change the legal effect of the
pleading. (Id.)
 
Analysis
 
Defendants demur to the fraud-based causes of action in the second amended
complaint (SAC) on the grounds that they are time-barred and not pled
with the requisite particularity required of fraud.
 
Fraud Pleading Standard
 
The elements of fraud are: “(a) misrepresentation
(false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity
(or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d)
justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Charnay v. Cobert
(2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 184.) “Fraud in the inducement . . . occurs when
‘the promisor knows what he is signing but his consent is induced by fraud,
mutual assent is present and a contract is formed, which, by reason of the
fraud is voidable.” (Rosenthal v. Great Western Financial Securities Corp.
(1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 415.) Negligent misrepresentation differs in that the
defendant makes false statements, honestly believing that they are true, but
without reasonable ground for such belief. (Buy v. Arthur Young & Co.
(1992) 3 Cal.4th 370, 407.) In California, fraud, including negligent
misrepresentation, must be pled with specificity. (Small v. Fritz Companies,
Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 184.) “The particularity demands that a
plaintiff plead facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means
the representations were tendered.” (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014)
224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469.)  
 
Defendants argue that the SAC does
not meet the heightened pleading standards regarding the alleged
misrepresentations.  The Court disagrees.  The SAC’s allegations provide the
who-what-when-where-why-how of the alleged misrepresentations. The SAC alleges
that Levine, on behalf of himself, VBP, Motorsports I and Motorsports II, made
the following representations to Yang concerning VBP’s financial status and the
monies lent. (SAC ¶ 48a-f.)
 
a. VBP, for several years, was, and
will continue to be, a valid and ongoing business concern; 
b. The use of the loan by VBP was
for the purpose of increasing VBP’s automobile sales business by purchasing
automobiles for resale (including but not limited to the G-Wagen), and that VBP
already had purchasers lined up who were committed to the purchase of those
automobiles (including but not limited to the G-Wagen), such that those sales
would generate an income sufficient to satisfy fully the debt owed pursuant to
the Promissory Note; 
c. Levine already had a buyer lined
up who was willing to pay $1,800,000.00 for the G-Wagen; 
d. VBP would purchase the G-Wagen
under its name and hold title until the G-Wagen was sold to a third party for a
substantial profit;
e. Levine and VBP were financially
sound and had sufficient assets and capital to justify the loan from Yang; and
f. VBP could and would comply with
and perform each material term of the Promissory Note, including repayment of
the entire debt owed under the Promissory Note.
 
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants
made these representations between October 29, 2018, and October 31, 2018,
during two phone conversations and in various emails. (SAC ¶ 49.) 
 
Plaintiff provides for some
specific facts regarding the truth of some of the misrepresentations, specifically
misrepresentations c-f. For instance, at the time that the representations were
made, VBP did not have any purchasers lined up who were committed to the
purchase of the automobiles obtained by VBP (including but not limited to the
G-Wagen) with the $1,200,000.00 lent by Yang. (SAC ¶ 52a.) Levine intended that
Motorsports I would purchase the G-Wagen and then transfer ownership to Motorsports
II. MI purchased the G-Wagen and the ownership of the G-Wagen was then
registered in MII’s name. (SAC ¶ 52e-f.) Further, VBP was not financially sound
because it did not have sufficient assets and capital to justify the loan and was
unable to comply with and perform each material term of the Promissory Note.
(SAC ¶ 52b-d, g.) From October 29, 2018, to October 31, 2018, Levine had no
intention to cause VBP to honor its contractual promises set forth in the
Promissory Note. (SAC ¶32, 72.) 
 
There are no facts showing the
falsity of the first two alleged misrepresentations (a and b). Plaintiff does
not allege that VBP was not a valid and ongoing business concern, or that the
use of the loan by VBP was for the purpose of increasing VBP’s automobile sales
business by purchasing automobiles for resale. Thus, the Court will focus on
the four misrepresentations that have factual support. 
 
The SAC further alleges that while Levine
may have initially believed or intended that the representations were true, he
had no reasonable grounds for believing that the representations were true when
he made them. (SAC ¶ 53.) Levine intended that Yang rely on the representations
to provide the funds. (SAC ¶¶ 54, 66.) Yang was ignorant of the falsity of the
misrepresentations and believed them to be true. (SAC ¶ 55.) Yang justifiably
relied upon said misrepresentations when he lent the sums to Defendants because
of Defendants’ superior knowledge concerning their own financial condition and
of the automobile resale business in general, as well as the decade long
personal friendship and business relationship between Yang and Levine. (SAC ¶
55.) Had Yang known the actual facts, he would not have made any loan. (SAC ¶
56.) Thus, the SAC alleges sufficient facts under the heightened pleading
standard as to the four misrepresentations identified as c-f.
 
Statute of Limitations
 
Defendants further argue that the limitations
period expired and there are no facts to support the delayed discovery rule.  The statute of limitations for fraud-based
causes of action is three years. (CCP § 338(d).) The cause of action begins to
accrue when the aggrieved party discovers the facts constituting the fraud. (See
San Francisco Unified School Dist. v. W.R. Grace & Co. (1995) 37
Cal.App.4th 1318, 1327 [“A cause of action does not accrue until the plaintiff
either discovers the injury and its negligent cause or could have discovered
the injury and cause through the exercise of reasonable diligence.”].)
 
A plaintiff whose complaint shows
on its face that his claim would be barred without the benefit of the discovery
rule must specifically plead facts to show (1) the time and manner of discovery
and (2) the inability to have made earlier discovery despite reasonable
diligence. (CAMSI IV v. Hunter Technology Corp. (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d
1525, 1536-37.) “Mere conclusory assertions that delay in discovery was
reasonable are insufficient and will not enable the complaint to withstand
general demurrer.” (Id.) 
 
Plaintiff filed his negligent
misrepresentation cause of action in the initial complaint on June 17, 2020,
against VBP only. The representations were made in October 2018. Three years
from the date of the misrepresentations was October 2021. Therefore, the
negligent misrepresentation cause was timely brought against VBP without
reference to delayed discovery. Accordingly, the demurrer to the negligent
misrepresentation cause of action is OVERRULED as to VBP.
 
Plaintiff brought the negligent
misrepresentation cause of action against the remaining defendants, and the intentional
misrepresentation cause of action against all defendants, for the first time when
requesting leave to file the first amended complaint on December 1, 2022.  Thus, Plaintiff must plead facts demonstrating
that he discovered the cause of action after December 1, 2019, and could not
have reasonably discovered the cause of action prior to that date.
 
As to the misrepresentations
regarding the existing buyer, VBP’s finances, and Levine’s intent to perform, Plaintiff
would have been aware of the breach of the contract. The numerous exhibits
attached to the SAC confirm that he was aware that Defendants did not have a
buyer lined up, and that Defendants would not comply with and perform each
material term of the Note. A reasonable person would be put on inquiry notice
regarding these facts after VBP failed to have a buyer for the G-Wagen and
failed to comply with the material terms of the Note. 
 
Plaintiff pleads facts showing
that, despite the breaches, he did not reasonably suspect fraud until March
2020. The SAC alleges that Yang and Levine were neighbors and had significant
business dealings stretching back a decade. (SAC ¶¶ 23-24.) Levine pacified
Yang from January 1, 2019, through May 28, 2020, by frequently making excuses
and promises of repayment. (SAC ¶ 30.) The SAC attaches several examples of
Levine’s text messages showing Levine’s placation. (SAC Exs. I, GG, JJ, KK.)
Levine also paid back some of the debt owed during the time period of July 17,
2019. to November 20, 2019. (SAC ¶ 31.) Plaintiff continued to trust Levine
until May 28, 2020. (SAC ¶¶ 16, 30.) Critically, Plaintiff discovered, during
the deposition of Levine on September 18, 2020, the identities of Motorsports I
and Motorsports II and their connection to this action. (SAC ¶ 33.) The SAC
claims that, until taking Levin’s deposition, as well as the receipt of VBP’s
responses to written discovery on September 29, 2022, Plaintiff did not
believe, and had no reason to believe, that LEVINE had committed fraud. (SAC ¶
34.) Thus, Plaintiff alleges facts which suggest that Defendants’ fraudulent
conduct was not apparent until, at the earliest, March 2020, or Levine’s
September 2022 deposition. It is therefore a question of fact as to when
Plaintiff had sufficient information that would lead a reasonable person to
believe that they had a fraud cause of action against Defendants or whether
Plaintiff’s discovery efforts were reasonable. 
 
Accordingly, the demurrer is
OVERRULED.
