And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to the demurrer filed by the defendants, Venice Business Partners Inc. The demurrer was filed to challenge the sufficiency of the plaintiff's second amended complaint (SAC) and to argue that the fraud-based causes of action are time-barred and not pled with the requisite particularity required of fraud.

The judge disagrees with the defendants' argument that the SAC does not meet the heightened pleading standards regarding the alleged misrepresentations. The judge finds that the SAC provides sufficient facts to support the four misrepresentations alleged by the plaintiff, which include misrepresentations regarding the financial status of Venice Business Partners Inc., the existence of a buyer for the G-Wagen, and Levine's intent to perform.

The judge also rules that the plaintiff's negligent misrepresentation cause of action is timely and that the plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to support the delayed discovery rule. The judge notes that the plaintiff did not reasonably suspect fraud until March 2020, and that the plaintiff's discovery efforts were reasonable.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is a summary of the judge's thinking based on the information presented before the hearing, and it sets forth the judge's tentative rulings on the issues presented in the demurrer.

```
And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by the defendants, Venice Business Partners Inc., to the second amended complaint filed by the plaintiff, Yang. The demurrer argues that the fraud-based causes of action in the complaint are time-barred and not pled with sufficient particularity.

The judge disagrees with the demurrer's argument, finding that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to support the fraud-based causes of action. Specifically, the complaint alleges that the defendants made misrepresentations to Yang regarding VBP's financial status and the use of the loan, and that Yang justifiably relied on these misrepresentations when lending the funds.

The judge also addresses the statute of limitations, finding that the plaintiff has pled facts sufficient to support the delayed discovery rule. According to the complaint, Yang did not discover the fraud until March 2020, and therefore the statute of limitations has not yet expired.

The judge overrules the demurrer, allowing the case to proceed. The defendants are ordered to file an answer within 10 days.

summary:
  Case Number: 20SMCV00819
  Hearing Date: September 26, 2023
  Case Name: Yang, v. Venice Business Partners Inc.
  Legal Standard: A demurrer tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. Courts read the allegations liberally and in context. Defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.
  Analysis:
    - Defendants demur to the fraud-based causes of action in the second amended complaint (SAC) on the grounds that they are time-barred and not pled with the requisite particularity required of fraud.
    - The SAC's allegations provide the who-what-when-where-why-how of the alleged misrepresentations.
    - Plaintiff alleges that Defendants made misrepresentations regarding VBP's financial status and the monies lent.
    - Plaintiff provides specific facts regarding the truth of some of the misrepresentations, specifically misrepresentations c-f.
    - The SAC further alleges that while Levine may have initially believed or intended that the representations were true, he had no reasonable grounds for believing that the representations were true when he made them.
    - The statute of limitations for fraud-based causes of action is three years. A plaintiff whose complaint shows on its face that his claim would be barred without the benefit of the discovery rule must specifically plead facts to show (1) the time and manner of discovery and (2) the inability to have made earlier discovery despite reasonable diligence.
    - Plaintiff brought the negligent misrepresentation cause of action against the remaining defendants, and the intentional misrepresentation cause of action against all defendants, for the first time when requesting leave to file the first amended complaint on December 1, 2022.
    - Plaintiff must plead facts demonstrating that he discovered the cause of action after December 1, 2019, and could not have reasonably discovered the cause of action prior to that date.
    - Plaintiff pleads facts showing that, despite the breaches, he did not reasonably suspect fraud until March 2020.

## Case Summary: Yang v. Venice Business Partners Inc.

**Case Number:** 20SMCV00819
**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023

**Parties:**
* **Plaintiff:** Yang
* **Defendant:** Venice Business Partners Inc. (VBP), Levine (representing himself, VBP, Motorsports I, and Motorsports II)

**Issues:**
* Demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) based on statute of limitations and failure to plead fraud with particularity.

**Facts:**

* Yang loaned $1,200,000 to VBP based on representations made by Levine between October 29, 2018, and October 31, 2018, regarding VBP's financial stability, the intended use of the loan (purchasing a G-Wagen for resale), and their ability to repay the loan.
*  Yang alleges that these representations were false and that VBP did not have a buyer lined up for the G-Wagen, lacked sufficient funds to justify the loan, and intended to breach the loan agreement.

**Legal Analysis:**

* **Fraud Pleading Standard:** The Court found that the SAC sufficiently alleges fraud with particularity, providing details about who made the representations, when, where, and how, along with evidence contradicting the representations.
* **Statute of Limitations:**
    * The statute of limitations for fraud is three years.
    * The Court found the negligent misrepresentation claim against VBP timely filed.
    * For the remaining defendants, the Court found that Plaintiff's discovery of the alleged fraud may have occurred after December 1, 2019, based on VBP's breaches and Levine's continued assurances.

**Ruling:** 

* The demurrer is OVERRULED.
* Defendant must file an answer within 10 days.


**Significant Statements:**

* The Court recognized that while Plaintiff had knowledge of breaches of contract, he did not have sufficient information to suggest fraud until later, based on the ongoing assurances from Levine and the discovery of Motorsports I and II's involvement.
* The Court found that the question of whether Plaintiff's discovery efforts were reasonable and when he had sufficient information to suspect fraud is a factual one.

**Analysis**
Defendants demur to the fraud-based causes of action in the second amended complaint, arguing that they are time-barred and not pled with the requisite particularity required of fraud.
