```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to the demurrer filed by the defendants, Venice Business Partners Inc. The demurrer was filed to challenge the sufficiency of the plaintiff's second amended complaint (SAC) and to argue that the fraud-based causes of action are time-barred and not pled with the requisite particularity required of fraud.

The judge disagrees with the defendants' argument that the SAC does not meet the heightened pleading standards regarding the alleged misrepresentations. The judge finds that the SAC provides sufficient facts to support the four misrepresentations alleged by the plaintiff, which include misrepresentations regarding the financial status of Venice Business Partners Inc., the existence of a buyer for the G-Wagen, and Levine's intent to perform.

The judge also rules that the plaintiff's negligent misrepresentation cause of action is timely and that the plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to support the delayed discovery rule. The judge notes that the plaintiff did not reasonably suspect fraud until March 2020, and that the plaintiff's discovery efforts were reasonable.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is a summary of the judge's thinking based on the information presented before the hearing, and it sets forth the judge's tentative rulings on the issues presented in the demurrer.
