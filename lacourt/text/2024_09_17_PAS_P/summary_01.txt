And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiff's Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement. The Plaintiff, MIP, LLC, is seeking to enforce a settlement agreement with defendants Monitor Polishing & Plating, Inc., Miguel Mercado, and Cristina Mercado. The settlement agreement was signed by the parties in January 2024, and it provides for the payment of $50,000 to the Plaintiff in installments over 45 months. The Plaintiff alleges that the defendants have breached the settlement agreement and failed to make the required payments.

The Court finds that the settlement agreement is valid and that the Plaintiff is entitled to enforce it. However, the Court is unclear on the amounts requested by the Plaintiff and has ordered the Plaintiff to clarify its calculation of the total amount of judgment sought.

The Court has also ordered the Plaintiff to file supplemental papers addressing the deficiencies discussed at the hearing and to correct the Proposed Judgment to reflect the calculations. The hearing on the Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement has been continued to a later date.
