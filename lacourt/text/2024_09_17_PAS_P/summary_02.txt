And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for sanctions against the defendant. The plaintiff had argued that the defendant had engaged in bad-faith actions or tactics by filing a motion to have requests for admission deemed admitted despite receiving responses. However, the judge found that the plaintiff had not properly served the discovery responses and that the defendant's motion was not frivolous or filed in bad faith. The judge also found that the plaintiff had not presented sufficient evidence to show that the defendant's motion was made in bad faith or with the intention to cause unnecessary delay. The judge denied the plaintiff's motion for sanctions and rejected the defendant's request for additional sanctions against the plaintiff.
