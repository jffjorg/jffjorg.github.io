And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by the parties. The plaintiff, Philip Rowley, has moved for summary judgment on the fourth amended cross-complaint, arguing that the defendant, Jordan James, has admitted that there is no factual basis for his claims. The judge agrees with Rowley and grants the motion for summary judgment.

James has also moved to enforce a settlement agreement under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, but the judge denies the motion. According to the judge, James is not a party to the settlement agreement and therefore cannot enforce it under the statute. The judge also notes that there is no evidence that James is a third-party beneficiary of the agreement.

The judge's ruling is based on the admissions made by James in response to Rowley's request for admissions, which were deemed admitted on April 25, 2024. The judge finds that James's opposition to the motion for summary judgment fails to meet the burden of demonstrating the presence of triable issues.
