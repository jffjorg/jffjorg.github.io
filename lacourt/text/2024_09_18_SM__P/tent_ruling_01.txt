Philip Rowley v. Jordan
James, et al. Case No. 21SMCV00336
Hearing Date:
September 18, 2024
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
Rowley’s Motion for Summary Judgment
 
Cross-complainant
James alleges cross-defendant Rowley failed to guarantee rent payments under
their lease agreement and defamed him by accusing him of domestic violence. Rowley
moves for summary judgment on the fourth amended cross-complaint, arguing James’
admissions indicate no genuine issue of material fact exists. 
 
Rowley’s request
for admissions request information about the factual basis for James’s claims.
Pl.’s Exh. 1. The Court deemed the request admitted on April 25, 2024. Rowley
Decl. ¶2. The admissions contradict the allegations in the cross-complaint
because they indicate no factual basis for James’s claims. Pl.’s Exh. 1. Based
on this, Rowley has met his initial burden on summary judgment. 
 
James's opposition
fails to meet the burden because his declaration does not refute the admissions
to demonstrate the presence of triable issues. James argues the court should
not consider the admissions because he is currently seeking to set them aside
due to his inadvertence. However, James is currently bound to the RFA
admissions. Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.410. If the admissions resulted from mistake
or inadvertence, a motion to withdraw the admissions should have been filed and
heard concurrently or before the motion for summary judgment. Code Civ. Proc.
§2033.300. 
 
James argues,
without authority, that Rowley's various pleadings contain conflicting facts.
However, this does not change the court’s analysis. GRANTED. 
 
Defendant James’s
Motion to Enforce Settlement and for order to Enter Judgment Pursuant to CCP
664.6
 
James moves to enforce a settlement agreement under Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6. 
The court may interpret the terms and conditions of a
settlement, Fiore v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561, 566, but may not
create material terms of a settlement, as opposed to deciding what terms the
parties themselves have previously agreed upon. Weddington Productions, Inc.
v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 810.
James contends the
settlement agreement contains a general release of all claims against him under
Civil Code §1542 and that he can enforce the agreement as a third-party
beneficiary. Rowley argues James was not a party to the agreement nor a
signatory. 
 
Code of Civil
Procedure §664.6 provides parties to the litigation must sign the settlement
agreement for the court to be able to enforce it under the statute. As James is
not a party to the agreement, he cannot enforce it under §664.6. Johnson v.
Department of Corrections (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1700, 1708. Further, there
is no evidence that he is a third-party beneficiary. DENIED.
