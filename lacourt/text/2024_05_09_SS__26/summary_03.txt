And here is the summary in English text:

The Court's tentative ruling denies the Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The Defendant, Vera Roca, LLC and Pablo Vera, filed the motion on February 27, 2024, seeking judgment on the pleadings as to the first, second, and third causes of action in the Complaint. However, the Court finds that the motion is not timely under the moving statute, as it was filed more than 30 days after the action was initially set for trial. Additionally, the Court finds that the motion fails to provide any citation and analysis of the allegations in the Complaint, making it impossible to determine whether the Complaint fails to allege the breach of an independent duty in support of the fraud causes of action.
