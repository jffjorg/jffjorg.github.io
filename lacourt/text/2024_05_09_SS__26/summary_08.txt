And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants defendant Sebastian Ortega's motion to quash service of the summons and complaint. The plaintiff, Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club, filed the complaint on January 29, 2024, and served the defendant on March 1, 2024. However, the defendant challenges the service, stating he was not at home on that day and does not know anyone by the name of Felix, who was listed as the person who served the papers. The court finds that the defendant has overcome the presumption of truth in the proof of service and places the burden on the plaintiff to demonstrate that service occurred as stated. Since no opposition has been filed, the court grants the defendant's motion to quash service.
