And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge rules that the Defendant's demurrer to the Complaint is sustained with 20 days' leave to amend. The Plaintiff, William Sandford, filed a complaint alleging that the Defendant, Experian Information Services, Inc., violated the California Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies Act (CCRAA) by failing to investigate and correct inaccuracies on his credit report. The Defendant demurred to the Complaint, arguing that it fails to plead sufficient facts to state a cause of action. The Judge agrees with the Defendant, finding that the Complaint does not specify which debts or information are inaccurate or how they are inaccurate, which is necessary to allege an inaccuracy. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff has alleged that the necessary facts to make such an allegation are in his possession, so leave to amend will be allowed.
