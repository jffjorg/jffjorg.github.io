Discussion
 
Motion for Leave to File First
Amended Complaint
 
“A court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as
may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (a)(1).) Such amendment may occur “at any time before or after
commencement of trial.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 576.) The court’s discretion will
usually be exercised liberally to permit amendments of the pleadings. (Nestle
v. City of Santa Monica (1972) 6 Cal.3d 920, 939.)¿ “A motion to
amend a pleading before trial must . . . [s]tate what allegations in the
previous pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any, and where, by page,
paragraph, and line number, the deleted allegations are located; and [s]tate
what allegations are proposed to be added to the previous pleading, if any, and
where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the additional allegations are
located.”¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(a).)¿ The declaration must also
specify the amendment’s effect, why it is necessary and proper, when the facts
supporting the amended allegations were discovered, and why the request was not
made earlier.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(b).)¿
            
If the party seeking the amendment has needlessly delayed,
and the delay has prejudiced the opposing party, the court has the discretion
to deny leave to amend.¿ (Hirsa v. Superior Court (1981) 118
Cal.App.3d 486, 490.)¿ Prejudice exists where the amendment would require
delaying the trial, resulting in loss of critical evidence, or added costs of
preparation.¿ (Solit v. Tokai Bank, Ltd. New York Branch (1999) 68
Cal.App.4th 1435, 1448.)¿¿ ¿
 
Plaintiff contends good cause exists for the Court to permit
her to amend the Complaint because “the facts alleged in the new amended
complaint arise out of the original facts that form the basis of this lawsuit.”
(Sybirski Decl. ¶ 7.) Specifically, the original complaint alleged that
Defendant was liable for their conduct in treating her dental issues while the
amendments merely reflect the fact that Defendant and putative defendants were
negligent in their conduct and further liable for malpractice and the physical
and emotional damages caused.” (Id.)
Moreover, Plaintiff states that the amendments are necessary and proper because
they set forth more fully and accurately all claims against Defendant and
Putative Defendant. (Mot. p.13.) Plaintiff’s amendments also include an
increase in the amount of damages. 
 
Plaintiff explains the timing of the discovery of the new
facts because that she recently discovered the “pleading requirements and
claimable damages in the State of California . . .” (Sybirski Decl. ¶ 6.) Given
that the amendments arise out of the original facts and the Motion is brought
long before the February 2025 trial date, there is no indication of needless
delay that would prejudice Defendant.
 
However, the motion is procedurally defective. For instance,
Plaintiff provides the following “1. Detailing of the parties, and adding Nikou
Zarabian DDS, Inc., a California corporation, and Does as a defendant Para. 1:4
(Pg. 1:2). 2. Clarity to facts, claims, and allegations at Para. 1:40 (Pg.
1:10). 3. Adding Prayer for Relief (Pg. 9:10). 4. Adding Causes of Action for
(i) Dental Malpractice– Para. 25:34 (Pg. 6:8); and (ii) Intentional Infliction
of Emotional Distress– Cover Page, Para. 35:40 (Pg. 8:9).” (Mot. pp.10-11.)
This fails to comply with Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(a) because “[a]
motion to amend a pleading before trial must . . . [s]tate what
allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted, if
any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the deleted allegations
are located; and [s]tate what allegations are proposed to be
added to the previous pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line
number, the additional allegations are located.”¿(emphasis added.)  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(a).)¿ 
 
Therefore, the request for leave to amend is continued to
allow Plaintiff to file an amended declaration with the necessary itemization
of the allegations to be added and deleted.
 
Motion to Reclassify Under Unlimited Jurisdiction Court
            
Code of Civil Procedure
section 403.040 allows a plaintiff to file a motion for reclassification of an
action within the time allowed for that party to amend the initial pleading.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (a).) “A party may amend its pleading once
without leave of court at any time before an answer, demurrer, or motion to
strike is filed, or after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed if the
amended pleading is filed and served no later than the date for filing an
opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., § 472, subd.
(a).) If the motion is made after the time for the plaintiff to amend the
pleading, the motion may only be granted if (1) the case is incorrectly
classified; and (2) the plaintiff shows good cause for not seeking
reclassification earlier. (Code Civ. Proc.,  § 403.040, subd. (b).)  
 
In Walker v. Superior
Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 257, 262, the California Supreme Court held that a
matter may be reclassified from unlimited to limited only if it appears to a
legal certainty that the plaintiff's damages will necessarily be less than
$25,000. (Walker v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 257.) If there is a
possibility that the damages will exceed $25,000.00, the case cannot be
transferred to limited. (Ibid.) This high standard is appropriate
in light of “the circumscribed procedures and recovery available in the limited
civil courts.” (Ytuarte v. Superior Court (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th
266, 278.)  In Ytuarte, the Court
of Appeals examined the principles it set forth in Walker and
held that “the court should reject the plaintiff's effort to reclassify the
action as unlimited only when the lack of jurisdiction as an “unlimited”
case is certain and clear.” (Id. at 279 [emphasis added].) 
Nevertheless, the plaintiff must present evidence to demonstrate a possibility
that the damages will exceed $25,000.00 and the trial court must review the
record to determine “whether a judgment in excess of $25,000.00 is obtainable.”
(Id. [emphasis added].) 
 
Here, Plaintiff’s Proposed First Amended Complaint states
her damages demand exceed the jurisdictional limits of the court. (Proposed
First Amended Complaint p. 7.) Specifically, Plaintiff states that her damages
are $25,250.00. (Sybirski Decl. ¶¶ 2.) However, effective january 1, 2024, the
jurisdictional maximum of the limited court is $35,000.00. (Code Civ. Proc., §
85, subdivision (a).) Therefore, the request to reclassify the action is
denied.

Amended Complaint and to Reclassify Case Under Unlimited Jurisdiction is
CONTINUED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART. THE HEARING IS CONTINUED TO JUNE 20, 2024
