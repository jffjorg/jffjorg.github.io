ANALYSIS:
 
On July 6, 2021, an arbitrator issued an Arbitration Award
in favor of Wasserman Media Group, LLC (“Petitioner”) and against Paul Lo Duca
(“Respondent”). On August 3, 2021, Petitioner filed the instant Petition to
Confirm Arbitration Award (the “Petition”). The Court set the Petition for
hearing on December 7, 2021 and ordered Petitioner to give notice. (Notice of
Hearing, 08/03/21.) On November 2, 2021, the Court continued the hearing to
March 17, 2022. (Notice of Continuance, 11/02/21.) On March 4, 2022, Petitioner
filed an Application for Publication, based on multiple failed attempts to
serve Respondent. (See Fieldsted Decl. ¶¶ 4-8.) On March 8, 2022, the court
rejected Petitioner’s Application for Publication because Petitioner had not
demonstrated diligence in its service attempts. (See Notice of Rejection,
3/8/22.) 
 
The Petition came for hearing on March 17, 2022 and was
continued again to September 13, 2022. Only Petitioner appeared and the minute
order reflects that the Petition was granted. (Minute Order, 09/13/22.)
However, as demonstrated by Petitioner’s Motion to Correct Order and Place
Petition Back on Calendar filed on November 28, 2023, the minute order dated
September 13, 2022 was incorrect. At that hearing, Petitioner represented that
the wrong person may have been served and sought a continuance of the hearing
date, which was granted. (Minute Order, 02/08/24.) In granting Petitioner’s
Motion to Correct Order and Place Petition Back on Calendar, the Court reset
the hearing on the Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award for May 9, 2024. (Ibid.)

 
Petitioner filed a proof of service of the Petition on
February 29, 2024. No response to the Petition has been filed to date. 
 
Legal Standard
 
“Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made
may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.  The petition shall name as respondent all
parties to the arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound
by the arbitration award.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1285.) “If a petition or response under this chapter is duly
served and filed, the court shall confirm the award as made, whether rendered
in this state or another state, unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects
the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the
proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1286.)
 
A response to a
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award that seeks to vacate or correct the award
must be served and filed no later than 100 days after the date of the service
of a signed copy of the award on the respondent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288.2.)
 
Discussion
 
Service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing
 
Code of Civil
Procedure, section 1290.4 requires that the Petition and Notice of Hearing be
served on Respondent “in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for
the service of such petition and notice” or “[i]f the arbitration agreement
does not provide the manner in which such service shall be made . . . [s]ervice
within this State shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service
of summons in an action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4, subds. (a), (b).) 
 
The arbitration agreement provides that notice to the parties
can be sent by electronic mail, express courier, overnight mail, or U.S.
Certified Mail. (Pet., Attachment 4(b), ¶13.) The latest Notice of Hearing and Petition were served on Respondent by electronic
and overnight mail on February 29, 2024. (Proof of Service by Mail, filed
02/29/24, ¶¶5-7.) Therefore, the Court finds that the requirements of Code of
Civil Procedure section 1290.4 are satisfied. 
 
Service of the Arbitration Award and Timing of Service
of Petition (CCP §§ 1283.6, 1288, 1288.4)
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 1283.6 requires that “[t]he neutral arbitrator shall serve a
signed copy of the award on each party to the arbitration personally or by
registered or certified mail or as provided in the agreement.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1283.6.) This requirement may be satisfied by service by the
arbitration, or upon proper service of the Award with the Petition. (See Murry v. Civil Service Employees Ins. Co. (1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 796, 799-800.) As the
Award was served with the Petition on February 29, 2024, the requirements of
Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6 are met. 
 
Also, a party seeking a court judgment confirming an
arbitration award must file and serve the petition no more than four years, but
not less than 10 days, after the award is served.
(CCP §§ 1288, 1288.4.) The
Petition was timely served two-and-a-half years after the Award was issued. 
 
Confirmation of the Arbitration Award
 
An arbitration award
is not directly enforceable until it is confirmed by a court and judgment is
entered.  (CCP § 1287.6; Jones v.
Kvistad (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 836, 840.) The court must confirm the award as
made, unless it corrects or vacates the award, or dismisses the
proceeding.  (CCP § 1286; Valsan
Partners Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25
Cal.App.4th 809, 818.) Code of Civil Procedure, section 1285.4 states a
petition under this chapter shall:
 
a)     
Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of
the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of such
an agreement.
 
b)     
Set forth the names of the arbitrators.
 
c)     
Set forth or have attached a copy of the award and the
written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.) The Petition includes a copy of
the agreement to arbitrate. (Pet., ¶4 and Attachment 4(b).) The parties entered
into a written contract on May 15, 2019, containing an arbitration provision. (Ibid.)
The Petition sets forth the name of the Arbitrator (Hon. Franz E. Miller) and
attaches a copy of the written opinion and award. (Id. at Attachment
8(c).) Petitioner demonstrates that on July 6, 2021, the arbitrator issued an
award requiring Respondent to pay Petitioner $6,000.00 in damages, $10,022.50
in attorneys’ fees, and arbitration costs of $1,633.27, for a total award of
$17,655.77. (Ibid.) The Court finds that the substantive portion of the
Petition has been satisfied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award is
GRANTED. JUDGMENT TO BE ENTERED IN FAVOR OF PETITIONER WASSERMAN MEDIA GROUP,
LLC IN THE AMOUNT OF $6,000.00 IN DAMAGES, $10,022.50 IN ATTORNEYS’
FEES, AND ARBITRATION COSTS OF $1,633.27, FOR A TOTAL AWARD OF $17,655.77. A PROPOSED
