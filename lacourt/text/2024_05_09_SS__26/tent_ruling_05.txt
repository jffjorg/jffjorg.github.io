ANALYSIS:  
 
On May 23, 2023, Plaintiff Hartford
Insurance Company of the Midwest (“Plaintiff”) initiated
this indemnity and interpleader action against Defendants Robert Castaneda dba
My Town Building and Remodeling (“Defendant Castaneda”), Josefina Orozco
(“Defendant Orozco”), Sally Gonzalez (“Defendant Gonzalez”), Larisa Owen
(“Defendant Owen”), Sareh Nabipour Kasma (“Defendant Kasma”), Chris Fikert
(“Defendant Chris”), and Lisa Fikert (“Defendant Lisa”). Defendant Orozco
answered on June 30, 2023; Defendant Owen answered on August 15, 2023.
Defendants Castaneda, Kasma, and the Fikerts defaulted on December 7, 2023.
Defendant Gonzalez was dismissed on the same date. 
 
The Complaint alleges that this action arises
from a dispute over Construction Bond No. 57BSBIN1134 (the “Bond”) in the penal
sum of $15,000.00. (Compl., ¶13.) Defendant Castaneda
allegedly agreed to indemnify Plaintiff in exchange for the issuance of
the Bond pursuant to an Application and
Indemnity Agreement (“the Indemnity Agreement”). (Id. at ¶¶13-14.) After
the Bond was issued, the remaining Defendants alleged that Defendant Castaneda committed some act that gave rise to
liability under the Bond and now have made claims against the Bond. (Id.
at ¶¶14-15.) Defendant Castaneda is liable to
Plaintiff for its expenses, costs and attorney’s fees arising out of issuance
of the Bond. (Id. at ¶¶15-16.) 
 
On March 7, 2024, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s Motion to Deposit by Stakeholder, for Discharge of Stakeholder, for
Attorney’s Fees and Costs, and for Temporary Restraining Order. (Minute Order,
03/07/24.) The Court also set the
instant Hearing on Disbursement of Funds for May 9, 2024. (Ibid.) Plaintiff
deposited the interpleader funds of $10,369.00 on April 15, 2024. 

 
Only Defendants Orozco
and Owen have filed a response to this action, but no claims to the
funds have been filed to date. Accordingly, the ruling on the disbursement of
funds will depend
upon evidence presented at the hearing. If no parties appear, the Hearing on
Disbursement of Funds will be placed off calendar and any unclaimed surplus
funds will be ordered to escheat according to law.
