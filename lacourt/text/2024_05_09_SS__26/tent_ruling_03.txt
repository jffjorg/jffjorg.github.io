Pafundi Law Firm v. Vera Roca, LLC, et al.JUDGMENT
ON THE PLEADINGS(CCP §§ 438, et seq.)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant Vera
Roca, LLC and Pablo Vera’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff
Pafundi Law Firm (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for breach of contract,
fraud, promissory estoppel, and conversion against Defendants Vera Roca, LLC
and Pablo Vera (“Defendants”) on August 23, 2022. Defendants filed a
Cross-Complaint for breach of contract and fraud against Plaintiff on January
20, 2023. On February 3, 2023, Defendants filed a First Amended
Cross-Complaint. On July 13, 2023, the Court sustained Plaintiff’s demurrer to
the fraud cause of action in the First Amended Cross-Complaint with leave to
amend. (Minute Order, 07/13/23.) On October 19, 2023, the Court sustained
Plaintiff’s demurrer to the Second Amended Cross-Complaint without leave to
amend. (Minute Order, 10/19/23.)
 
Defendants filed
the instant Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings with respect to the Complaint
on February 27, 2024. Plaintiff filed an opposition on April 26, 2024.
 
Discussion
 
Defendants move for judgment on
the pleadings pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 438, pursuant to
which the parties are required to meet and confer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 438,
439.) The Motion is accompanied by a meet and confer declaration, as required.
(Motion, Overland Decl., ¶¶1-5 and Exh. 1.) 
 
First, the Motion is not timely
under the moving statute. Code of Civil Procedure section 438 states: “No
motion may be made pursuant to this section if a pretrial conference order has
been entered pursuant to Section 575, or within 30 days of the date the action
is initially set for trial, whichever is later, unless the court otherwise
permits.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (e).) This action was initially set
for trial on February 20, 2024 but the Motion was not filed until February 27,
2024. 
 
Even if the Court were to permit
the Motion to be heard, Defendants have not shown the judgment on the pleadings
is warranted as to the Complaint. Defendants move for judgment on pleadings as
to the first, second, and third causes of action in the Complaint, which are
for (1) Fraud – Promise without Intent to Perform; (2) Fraud – Intentional or
Negligent Misrepresentation; and (3) Fraud – Cal. Civ. Code § 1572. Defendants point
to the Court order sustaining Cross-Defendant’s demurrer to the fraud cause of
action asserted in the First Amended Cross-Complaint and argue the Court should
apply its reasoning to the fraud causes of action in the Complaint, as well.
(Motion, p. 4:1-20.) The Motion, however, fails to provide any citation and
analysis of the allegations in the Complaint. The Court cannot determine
whether the Complaint fails to allege the breach of an independent duty in
support of the fraud causes of action without such citation and analysis. 
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Defendants Vera Roca,
LLC and Pablo Vera’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
