RULING
 



WEST CASITAS, LLC, 
 
                                  Plaintiff,
  
         v.
 
 
SWING HOUSE STAGES, INC.,
 
                                  Defendant.
 


 Case No: 
  21STCV37974
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  June 11, 2024
 Calendar Number:  2



 
 
 
Plaintiff West Casitas, LLC (“Plaintiff”) moves for an award
of attorney’s fees against Defendant Swing House Stages, Inc. (“Defendant”) in
the amount of $337,858.20.
 
The Court is tentatively inclined to GRANT Plaintiff’s
motion.
 
            The
Court has concerns, however, that some of the time entries provided may have
been double-counted with the time entries in the Kanon Parties’ previous fee
motion. Both Plaintiff and the Kanon Parties are represented by the same
attorneys. For example, on March 31, 2022, Odson billed both Plaintiff and the
Kanon Parties for $1,485.00 for 2 hours spent on reviewing the cross-complaint,
analyzing defenses against the cross-complaint, and a teleconference. The Court
requests that Plaintiff’s counsel clarify whether this amount was billed to
both parties, and, if it was, how many such entries there are.  The Court will need a rigorous accounting to
ensure that Plaintiff is not double-counting any item of attorney’s fees.  If that accounting cannot be provided at the
hearing, the Court will continue this motion.
 
Background
 
Plaintiff is the owner of the property located at 3229
Casitas Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90039 (the “Property”). (Stauffer Decl.
¶ 2.) Elite Property Management, LLC (“Elite”) has managed the property on
Plaintiff’s behalf since September 2019. (Stauffer Decl. ¶ 1.)
 
On February 18, 2014, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a
written lease (the “Lease”) under which Defendant would rent the Property from
Plaintiff. (Stauffer Decl. ¶ 3; Compendium of Exhibits (“Compendium”), Exh. 1
(the “Lease”).) The Lease provides for a term of 10 years, beginning February
18, 2014, and ending February 17, 2024. 
(Lease at p. 8 [page numbers in the Compendium refer to the overall page
number in the PDF file].) Starting on February 18, 2020, the monthly base rent under
the lease was $28,500. (Lease at 8.)
 
Beginning in April 2020, Defendant began to fail to make its
full monthly base rent payments. (Stauffer Decl. ¶ 4.) The final payment that
Defendant made on the lease was a partial payment of one half of the monthly
rent in July 2021. (Stauffer Decl. ¶ 4.) Failure to pay rent when due
constitutes a default on the Lease. (Lease at p. 21.)
 
From around October 2020 to October 2021, Plaintiff, Elite,
and Defendant attempted to come to an agreement under which Plaintiff would pay
the missing rent, but they reached no agreement. (Stauffer Decl. ¶¶ 9-30.)
 
Plaintiff filed this action against Defendant on October 14,
2021, alleging one cause of action for breach of lease.
 
On March 28, 2022, Swing House and Genoveva Winsen
(collectively, the “Cross-Complainants”) filed a cross-complaint against Kanon
Ventures, LLC; Mark Beskind; Jeff Stauffer; Ara Tavitian; and Avedis Tavitian
(“Avo”) (collectively, the “Kanon Parties”), and West Casitas (collectively
with the Kanon Parties, “Cross-Defendants”), stating claims for (1) breach of
contract; (2) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (3)
intentional misrepresentation; (4) negligent misrepresentation; (5) concealment;
(6) discrimination in violation of Civil Code section 51; (7) sexual harassment
in violation of Civil Code section 51.9; (8) violation of Business &
Professions Code section 17200; (9) declaratory relief; (10) violation of Civil
Code section 3273.10; and (11) intentional violation of the Los Angeles County
eviction moratorium.
 
On February 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed a separate action for
unlawful detainer in the Los Angeles County Superior Court. (Stauffer Decl. ¶
32.) The eviction action was resolved in part by a settlement dated March 23,
2023, which resolved the issue of possession but provided that it did not
encompass any claims for damages. (Stauffer Decl. ¶ 33.)
 
The Kanon Parties, except for Avo, filed a motion for
summary judgment as to the cross-claims. West Casitas and Avo filed their own
summary judgment motion as to the cross-claims. 
The Court granted both summary judgment motions on June 7, 2023.  The Court entered judgment in favor of the
Kanon Parties (including Avo) on the Cross-Complaint in its entirety on August
9, 2023.
 
On December 5, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion
for summary judgment on the Complaint. Judgment was entered in Plaintiff’s
favor on February 28, 2024.
 
On December 14, 2023, the Court granted the Kanon Parties’
motion for attorney’s fees related to the Cross-Complaint in the amount of
$326,469.76.
 
Plaintiff filed this motion on April 29, 2024. Defendant has
not filed an opposition.
 
Legal Standard
 
 
 
Discussion
 
Entitlement to Fees
 
Section 12.3 of the Lease provides that the prevailing party
in an action arising from the Lease will be entitled to attorney’s fees.
 
Plaintiff obtained a judgment in its favor on its only cause
of action for breach of the lease. Plaintiff is therefore a prevailing party
and is thus entitled to attorney’s fees.
 
Hourly Rate and Hours
 
The trial court has broad authority to determine the amount
of a reasonable fee. (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095.)  
 
The moving party bears the burden of proof as to
“reasonableness” of any fee claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(5).)
The party seeking fees has the burden of documenting the appropriate hours
expended and hourly rates. (City of Colton v. Singletary (2012) 206
Cal.App.4th 751, 784.) This burden requires competent evidence as to the nature
and value of the services rendered. (Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182
Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) A plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima
facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were necessarily
incurred. (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) 
 
“In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many
hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point
to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to
the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative,
or unrelated do not suffice.” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 488, quoting Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. California
Ins. Guarantee Ass’n (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) When items are
properly objected to, the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as
costs. (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623-624.)
 
For Daniel French, Plaintiff requests an hourly rate of
$337.50 for 2021, $382.50 for 2022 and $450 for 2023, along with a $300 special
rate for time spent preparing for appellate argument in 2023. For Robert Odson,
Plaintiff requests an hourly rate of $711 for 2021, $742.50 for 2022, $787.50
for 2023, and $805.50 for 2024. The qualifications of these attorneys is set
forth in the declarations supporting the motion.  (Odson Decl. ¶¶ 10, 13.) The Court finds
these hourly rates to be reasonable.
 
Plaintiff provides a compendium of the billing entries for
this case. (Odson Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. 2.) This case was hard fought, including
multiple dispositive motions, discovery motion practice, and appellate practice.
The Court has reviewed the records and finds that the time expenditures were,
on their face, reasonable. 
 
            The
Court has concerns, however, that some of the time entries provided may have
been double-counted with the time entries in the Kanon Parties’ previous fee
motion. Both Plaintiff and the Kanon Parties are represented by the same
attorneys. For example, on March 31, 2022, Odson billed both Plaintiff and the
Kanon Parties for $1,485.00 for 2 hours spent on reviewing the cross-complaint,
analyzing defenses against the cross-complaint, and a teleconference. The Court
requests that Plaintiff’s counsel clarify whether this amount was billed to
both parties, and, if it was, how many such entries there are.
