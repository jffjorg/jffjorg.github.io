The judge has reviewed the demurrer filed by the defendants and has made a tentative ruling on the case. The court has sustained the demurrer to the third and 11th claims, with leave to amend. The court has overruled the demurrer to the remaining claims.

* The plaintiff has adequately alleged a breach of contract claim based on the settlement agreement.
* The plaintiff has adequately alleged a breach of implied contract claim based on the employment contract.
* The court has sustained the demurrer to the third claim, with leave to amend, as the plaintiff's allegations do not go beyond a mere breach of contract.
* The court has overruled the demurrer to the eighth claim, alleging labor code violations.
* The court has sustained the demurrer to the eleventh claim, with leave to amend, as the plaintiff has not alleged a lack of intent to perform the contract.
* The court has overruled the demurrer to the 14th claim, alleging violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act and Bane Act.

The court has ordered the parties to file a joint statement of issues and a proposed order within 10 days.
