MAURICE VAN THROWER, 
 
                                  Plaintiff,
  
         v.
 
 
MCMURRAY HENRIKS, LLP, et al.,
 
                                  Defendants.
 


 Case No: 
  23STCV16942
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  June 11, 2024
 Calendar Number:  4



 
 
 
Defendants McMurray Henriks, LLP (“MH”), Randy H. McMurray,
Yana G. Henriks, and Lauren L. Friedenberg (collectively, “Moving Defendants”) move
for an award of attorney’s fees and costs under Code of Civil Procedure,
section 425.15, subd. (c)(1).
 
Moving Defendants request an award of $51,318.00, consisting
of:
 
(1) $39,636.00 relating to their anti-SLAPP motion,
including:
            
            (a) $37,188.00
in attorney’s fees; and 
            
            (b) $2,448.00
in costs; and
 
(2) $11,682 in attorney’s fees relating to this fees motion.
 
The Court CONTINUES Moving Defendants’ motion. It appears
that Plaintiff has served, but not filed, an opposition. The Court ORDERS
Plaintiff to file any such opposition within 15 days of this order. The Court also
requests that Moving Defendants provide the hourly rate that was actually
charged to them by Counsel.
 
Background
 
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants conspired to deprive him
of any recovery in the wrongful death action for his brother, Christopher Nash
(“Christopher”).
 
On March 20, 2019, Christopher was booked into Los Angeles
County Sheriff’s Department – Century Regional Detention Facility (“CRDF”).
Later that day, 17 hours after being booked, Christopher was found unresponsive
in his solitary confinement cell and was pronounced dead at the scene.
 
Defendant Anthony Nash (“Nash”), Christopher’s biological
brother, contacted MH to pursue a claim arising from Christopher’s death. At
the time, a proceeding was neither filed nor pending for the administration of
Christopher’s estate. (Henriks Decl. at ¶ 3; Exh. 2 at p. 46.) Christopher was
neither married nor had any children at the time of his death. (Henriks Decl.
at ¶ 3; Exh. 2 at p. 46.) As Christopher’s biological brother, Nash was a
successor in interest to Christopher pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
sections 377.10-377.11 and Probate Code, section 6402. (Henriks Decl. at ¶ 3;
Exh. 2 at p. 46.) Plaintiff was never a client of MH, nor does the Complaint
allege that he was.  
 
On March 20, 2020, MH filed a wrongful death action on
behalf of the Estate of Christopher Nash, by and through Anthony Nash, Los
Angeles County Superior Court Case No. 20STCV11744 (the Wrongful Death Action).
Plaintiff and four other siblings of Nash were joined as Nominal Defendants in
the complaint in the Wrongful Death Action. (Henriks Decl. ¶ 4; Exh. 3 at pp.
55-56.)
 
MH received a signed Notice of Acknowledgement of Receipt,
dated May 14, 2020, indicating that Plaintiff was served with the Summons and
Complaint in the Wrongful Death Action. (Henriks Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. 3 at p. 84.)
On June 4, 2020, MH filed a Declaration of Plaintiff Anthony Nash Re:
Successorship. (Henriks Decl. ¶ 3, Exh. 2 at pp. 45-51.) On June 5, 2020, MH
filed a Proof of Service reflecting service of the declaration on Plaintiff.
(Henriks Decl. ¶ 5, Exh. 4 at pp. 82-84.)
 
Plaintiff alleges in this action that between 2020 and 2021,
he received a copy of the Complaint in the wrongful death action and contacted
Nash. Plaintiff alleges that Nash informed Plaintiff that there was no reason
for Plaintiff to contact MH, as Nash would handle everything for the family.
Plaintiff alleges that, in reliance on Nash’s statement, he took no action.
 
On October 21, 2020, the Wrongful Death Action was removed
to the United States District Court for the Central District of California. On
August 3, 2021, a settlement was reached and notice was provided to the
District Court.
 
Plaintiff filed this action against the Moving Defendants
and Nash (collectively, “Defendants”) on July 18, 2023, raising claims for (1)
fraud by intentional misrepresentation; (2) breach of fiduciary duty; (3)
negligence/malpractice; (4) restitution/unjust enrichment; (5) conversion; (6)
actual fraud; (7) breach of trust; and (8) failure to protect the trust of
other beneficiaries.
 
Plaintiff alleges that MH failed in its duties to the Estate
of Christopher Nash or failed to protect the legal beneficiaries of the Estate,
Plaintiff and Christopher’s other siblings, through acts which included failing
to conduct minimum due diligence to ascertain if the information provided by
Nash was true and to locate Plaintiff.
 
On February 22, 2024, the Court granted Moving Defendants’
special motion to strike the claims against them under Code of Civil Procedure,
section 425.16 (the “Anti-SLAPP Motion”) and struck the Complaint as against
Moving Defendants. The Court found, among other things, that Plaintiff’s claims
against Moving Defendants were barred by litigation privilege.
 
Moving Defendants filed this motion
on April 12, 2024. Moving Defendants filed a reply on June 3, 2024. Based on
the contents of the reply, Plaintiff appears to have served an opposition on
Moving Defendants. However, Plaintiff did not file a reply with the Court.
 
Legal Standard
 
A defendant who prevails on an anti-SLAPP motion is
generally entitled to recover attorney fees and costs. (Code Civ. Proc., §
425.16, subd. (c)(1).)
 
Attorney’s fees in anti-SLAPP motions are determined using
the lodestar method. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) “Under
the lodestar method, the trial court must first determine the lodestar
figure—the reasonable hours spent multiplied by the reasonable hourly
rate—based on a careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly
compensation of each attorney involved in the presentation of the case.” (Glaviano
v. Sacramento City Unified School Dist. (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 744,
751.) 
 
The trial court has broad authority to determine the amount
of a reasonable fee. (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095.)  
 
The moving party bears the burden of proof as to
“reasonableness” of any fee claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(5).)
The party seeking fees has the burden of documenting the appropriate hours
expended and hourly rates. (City of Colton v. Singletary (2012) 206
Cal.App.4th 751, 784.) This burden requires competent evidence as to the nature
and value of the services rendered. (Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182
Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) A plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima
facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were necessarily
incurred. (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) 
 
“In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many
hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point
to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to
the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative,
or unrelated do not suffice.” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 488, quoting Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. California
Ins. Guarantee Ass’n (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) When items are
properly objected to, the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as
costs. (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623-624.)
 
Discussion
 
Entitlement to Fees and Costs
 
Moving Defendants prevailed on their anti-SLAPP motion as to
the entire Complaint. They are therefore entitled to recover their attorney
fees and costs under Code of Civil Procedure, section 425.16, subd. (c)(1).
 
Amount of Attorney’s Fees
 
Moving Defendants request an hourly rate of $649.00 for
attorney Howard Jason Smith. Counsel bases this calculation on the Laffey
Matrix. (Smith Decl. ¶¶ 17-18.) It is unclear whether this is the rate actually
charged by counsel. The billing records provided indicate time expended, but
not the rate charged for that time. (Smith Decl., Ex. 3.) The Court requests
that Moving Defendants clarify what rate was actually charged by counsel.
 
Moving Defendants request 57.3 hours for Smith relating to
the anti-SLAPP motion and 18 hours for Smith relating to this fee motion.
(Smith Decl. ¶¶ 11-13, 20, Ex. 3 at pp. 68-81.)
 
The anti-SLAPP motion was not especially complicated,
because it involved straightforward issues of litigation privilege. The Court
therefore reduces the hours on the anti-SLAPP motion to 35.0. Because this fee
motion is similarly straightforward, the Court reduces the hours awarded for
this motion to 6.0.
 
Amount of Costs
 
Moving Defendants incurred costs of $2,448.00 for the
Anti-SLAPP Motion, which included four first appearance fees. (Smith Decl. ¶
13.)
