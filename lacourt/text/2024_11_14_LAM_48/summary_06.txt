And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively granted the motion of Ilana M. Kaufman, counsel for the defendants Elias Shokrian, Calitex LLC, and Montrose LP, to be relieved as counsel. The motion is unopposed and is granted absent a showing of resulting prejudice. However, the court has scheduled an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to Retain New Counsel for Calitex LLC and Montrose LP, as a corporation cannot represent itself in court without a lawyer. The defendants must retain new counsel by the scheduled date or risk having their answer struck and being placed in default.
