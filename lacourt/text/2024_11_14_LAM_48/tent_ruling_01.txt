[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO TAX
  COSTS
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
November 14, 2024



 
On
June 7, 2024, the Court entered judgment in favor of Defendants Jamison Services
Inc. and Central Plaza LLC, and against Plaintiff Hyung Koo.
On
June 25, 2024, Jamison Services Inc. and Central Plaza LLC filed a Memorandum of
Costs for $57,376.83 in costs.  On July 1
and 2, 2024, Jamison Services Inc., Central Plaza LLC, and Jamison Realty Advisors
LLC filed their Memorandum of Costs for $32,726.79 in costs.
On
July 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to tax costs.
On
August 13, 2024, the Court continued the hearing on the motion and ordered Defendants
to file separate memoranda of costs for their own allocations of costs.
On
September 13, 2024, Defendants filed an Amended Memorandum of Costs reflecting total
costs of $56,801.45.
On
October 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to tax costs.  No oppositions were filed.
DISCUSSION
“A
‘verified memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence of the propriety’ of the items
listed on it, and the burden is on the party challenging these costs to demonstrate
that they were not reasonable or necessary.” 
(Adams v. Ford Motor Co. (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 1475, 1486.)  “[I]f the correctness of the memorandum is challenged
either in whole or in part by the affidavit or other evidence of the contesting
party, the burden is then on the party claiming the costs and disbursements to show
that the items charged were for matters necessarily relevant and material to
the issues involved in the action.”  (Oak
Grove School Dist. of Santa Clara County v. City Title Ins. Co. (1963) 217 Cal.App.2d
678, 699 (Oak Grove).)
Plaintiff
moves to strike $45,445.08 in deposition costs, $1,832.25 in fees for electronic
filing or service, and $5,395.74 in “other” costs.  (See Motion at pp. 1, 8.)
Plaintiff
notes that Jamison Realty Advisors Inc’s amended memorandum of costs was reduced
by only $2,666.67 (the cost of mediation). 
(Motion at p. 3.)  Defendants’ memorandum
of costs was reduced by only $575.38.  (Ibid.)
Plaintiff
argues that the deposition costs are uncertain because many of the charges have
been changed from the original memorandum without any explanation.  (Motion at pp. 4-5; McCormick Decl., Ex. 3.)  Typically, a party claiming costs does not need
to provide documentation of each cost, but Plaintiff’s challenge is valid here because
of the discrepancies between the original and amended memoranda.
Plaintiff
argues that some of the fees for electronic filing and service are instead for unnecessary
personal service of a motion for summary judgment.  (Motion at p. 6; McCormick Decl., Ex. 3.)  The electronic filing and service costs are proper
and recoverable without evidence of the expenses.  However, the Court will strike the unnecessary
costs for personal service of a motion for summary judgment.
Plaintiff
argues that some of the “other” costs are not statutorily allowable.  (Motion at pp. 6-8.)  Plaintiff identifies non-deposition mileage ($432.96),
meals ($229.67), lodging ($2,066.44), and mediation ($2,666.67).  (Ibid; McCormick Decl., Ex. 3.)  These categories are not recoverable.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a).)
Plaintiff
has provided sufficient evidence and support to challenge these claimed costs.  Defendants did not file any oppositions, so they
did not show that the items charged were for matters necessarily relevant and material
to the issues involved in the action.  (See
Oak Grove, supra, 217 Cal.App.2d at p. 699.)  Accordingly, the motion to tax costs is granted.
CONCLUSION
The
unopposed motion to tax costs is GRANTED.
The
Court strikes $45,445.08 in deposition costs, $1,832.25 in fees for electronic filing
or service, and $5,395.74 in “other” costs (total of $52,673.17).
Defendants
Jamison Services Inc. and Central Plaza LLC shall recover $4,128.28 pursuant to
their Amended Memorandum of Costs.
Moving
party to give notice.
