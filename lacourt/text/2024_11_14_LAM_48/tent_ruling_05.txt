[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT’S MOTION
  TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
November 14, 2024



 
On May 23, 2024, Plaintiff Esteban Penaloza filed this
action against Defendant Level One Protection Inc.  On August 26, 2024, the Court entered default
against Defendant.
On October 10, 2024, Defendant filed a
motion to set aside the entry of default.

The Court may relieve a party or counsel from a judgment
resulting from mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)  The application for relief must be made within
a reasonable time, not to exceed six months, after the judgment.  (Ibid.)  “Section 473 is often applied liberally where
the party in default moves promptly to seek relief, and the party opposing the motion
will not suffer prejudice if relief is granted. 
[Citations.]  In such situations ‘very
slight evidence will be required to justify a court in setting aside the default.’  [Citation.]” 
(Elston v. City of Turlock (1985) 38 Cal.3d 227, 233.)
Defendant’s owner declares that he suffered a heart attack
in April 2024 and was unable to return to work until July 2024.  (G. Aristizabal Decl. ¶ 2; J. Aristizabal Decl.
¶ 2.)  During this period, his wife attempted
to temporarily manage the business.  (G. Aristizabal
Decl. ¶ 3; J. Aristizabal ¶ 3.)  Neither he
nor his wife have any record of the agent for service of process emailing the summons
and complaint to them.  (G. Aristizabal Decl.
¶¶ 4-5; J. Aristizabal Decl. ¶¶ 3-4.)  He
did not become aware of this action until the agent for service of process sent
an email notification about the Request for Entry of Default in September 2024,
and then he immediately retained counsel. 
(G. Aristizabal Decl. ¶ 6)
Plaintiff
did not file any opposition.  Additionally,
Plaintiff’s October 31, 2024 Case Management Statement indicates that Plaintiff
requests a jury trial and is willing to participate in mediation or a settlement
conference, which further suggests that Plaintiff does not oppose moving forward
with Defendant’s participation in this case.
Based
on these facts—and in the absence of any opposition—the Court finds that the default
is the result of mistake, inadvertence,
or excusable neglect, and Defendant is entitled to relief under Code of Civil
Procedure section 473.
The
unopposed motion to set aside the default is GRANTED.  The default entered on August 26, 2024 is VACATED.
Defendant
is ordered to file a responsive pleading within 14 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
