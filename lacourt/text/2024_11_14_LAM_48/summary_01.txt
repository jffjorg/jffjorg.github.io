The court found that the plaintiff had provided sufficient evidence to challenge these costs and that the defendants had not shown that the items charged were for matters necessarily relevant and material to the issues involved in the action. The court struck $52,673.17 in costs and ordered the defendants to recover $4,128.28 in costs.
