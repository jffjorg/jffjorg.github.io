  CASE NO.: 24STCV15340
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
November 14, 2024



 
Ilana
M. Kaufman of Miller Law Partners PC, counsel of record for Defendants Elias Shokrian,
Calitex LLC, and Montrose LP, seeks to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration states that there has been
a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship, and irreconcilable differences
make it unreasonably difficult to effectively continue with the relationship.  No party opposed the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motions
comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Trial has not yet been set, and there is no prejudice
to Defendants.
The
proposed orders no longer reflect the correct future hearing dates.  Before signing the orders, the Court will correct
this information.
The
unopposed motions to be relieved are GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 orders and this order on Defendants
and all parties who have appeared.
However,
“a corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona
or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  Therefore, an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure
to Retain New Counsel for Calitex LLC and Montrose LP is scheduled for _______________
at 8:30 a.m. in Department 48 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
Calitex
LLC and Montrose LP must retain new counsel by that date or the Court may strike
their answer and place them in default.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 14th day of November 2024
