  CASE NO.: 23STCV25490
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
November 14, 2024



 
On
October 18, 2023, Plaintiff Digital Brands Group Inc. (a Delaware corporation) filed
this action against Defendants Baxter Ross and Tautology Ltd.
On
August 22, 2024, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss because Plaintiff is not qualified
to do business in California.
A
foreign corporation that conducts business in California but does not hold a valid
certificate from the Secretary of State may not maintain any action or proceeding
in California.  (Corp. Code, § 2203, subd.
(c).)  “The failure of a foreign corporation
to qualify to transact business prior to commencing an action is a matter of abatement
of the action.”  (United Medical Management
Ltd. v. Gatto (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1732, 1740.)
Defendants
made a Public Records Request of the Secretary of State of California for any evidence
of registration by Plaintiff as a foreign corporation to do business in California.  (Gallo Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. 3.)  On May 10, 2024, Defendants received a Certificate
of No Record by the Secretary of State of California, dated May 10, 2024, stating
that there was no record found for Plaintiff. 
(Gallo Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. 4.)  On
June 24, 2024, Defendants received another Certificate of No Record, dated April
11, 2024.  (Gallo Decl. ¶ 7 & Ex. 5.)
The
Certificates of No Record “certify that a diligent search has been made in the corporate
files of this office [Secretary of State] and that there is no record of a California
or foreign corporation, active or inactive,” in Plaintiff’s name.  (Gallo Decl., Exs. 4-5.)  This evidence shows that Plaintiff was not qualified
to do business in California, and it may not maintain this action.  (See Corp. Code, § 2203, subd. (c).)
Additionally,
“a corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona
or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  The Court warned Plaintiff of this when relieving
their counsel on September 10, 2024 and set an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal
for Plaintiff's Failure to Retain New Legal Representation.  Plaintiff still has not obtained new counsel.
The
motion is GRANTED.
The
Court orders this action DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
