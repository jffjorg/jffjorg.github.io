And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for a protective order, which means they do not have to answer the plaintiffs' requests for admission (RFAs) and the corresponding form interrogatory no. 17.1. The judge found that the 482 RFAs were burdensome, harassing, and overbroad, and that the plaintiffs had not met their burden of justifying the number of RFAs. The judge ordered the defendants to pay an additional filing fee within 10 days. The judge also warned the defendants that they should file separate motions for each discovery request and party, or the court may strike or deny the motions. The judge's ruling does not prejudice the plaintiffs' ability to serve new and more tailored sets of RFAs.
