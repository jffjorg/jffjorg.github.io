And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

On November 14, 2024, Judge Thomas D. Long of the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to set aside the default entered on August 26, 2024. The defendant, Level One Protection, Inc., had filed the motion on October 10, 2024, claiming that the default was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. Specifically, the defendant's owner had suffered a heart attack in April 2024 and was unable to return to work until July 2024, during which time his wife attempted to manage the business. The defendant claims that neither he nor his wife received the summons and complaint and only became aware of the action in September 2024.

The judge found that the default was indeed the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect and granted the defendant's motion to set aside the default. The judge also ordered the defendant to file a responsive pleading within 14 days and directed the parties who intend to submit on the tentative ruling to send an email to the court.
