interrupting the Court and telling the Court to not “talk over” you, saying “watch
how you address me,” “don’t interrupt [you] when [you’re] making [your]
argument,” and “watch how you talk to me”, and (iii) stating that you would
disregard the Court’s order for you to appear for any sanctions and/or contempt
hearing, including stating that you “could care less about [my] orders” and “could
care less about a contempt hearing.”

Case No. 22STCV11119
 
AFFIDAVIT
  OF JUDGE JON TAKASUGI IN RE CONTEMPT OF RESHMA KAMATH 
 
 
 
 



 
 
            I,
Jon Takasugi, declare as follows: 
1.         I am a judge of the Superior Court, Los Angeles County,
California and I have been assigned to preside over the above-entitled action.  
2.         On September 11, 2024, at approximately 8:45 a.m., I called the
instant matter.  Counsel for plaintiff
Hasmik Yaghobyan (Plaintiff), Reshma Kamath announced her appearance on LA
Court Connect (LACC).  Michael Atkins was
present in person for defendant Los Angeles County and Rebecca Chmura for
defendant Fernando Lemus on LACC.
            3.         The matter was set for an OSC re:
dismissal (settlement).  There was no
court reporter.
            4.         Ms. Kamath spoke first, stating it has
been seven (7) months since a settlement was reached and defendant Los Angeles
County has not sent a check.  She said
she was contemplating filing a motion to vacate the settlement and to move
forward with a trial.
            5.         I addressed Mr. Atkins with regard to
the delay.  He indicated there were two
issues potentially causing delay: First, he described the bureaucracy involved
with getting the County to cut a check and that it requires Board of Supervisor
approval.  Secondly, he indicated the
settlement agreement signed by Plaintiff indicates the payment is to be made
directly to Plaintiff’s former attorney, Michael Justice, who was substituted
out on April 11, 2024, after the settlement was reached.  In addition, Mr. Atkins advised the Court
that Mr. Justice had filed a Notice of Lien for Attorney Services so the County
was unclear as to whom the check should be directed.
            6.         In response, Ms. Kamath made a personal
and disparaging remark about Mr. Atkins. 
I asked Ms. Kamath to refrain from personal attacks as they are
unprofessional and unnecessary. 
Understanding there can be a delay when utilizing LACC, I repeated
several times to stop attacking Mr. Atkins. Ms. Kamath and I were talking at
the same time, when I heard Ms. Kamath say “Shut Up!”
            7.         I advised Ms. Kamath that Mr. Atkins
was not talking, and that the Court was trying to maintain civility.  I asked Ms. Kamath if her comments
(specifically “Shut Up”) were directed at the Court and she told me not to
“talk over” her, “watch how you address me,” “don’t interrupt me when I’m
making my argument,” and “watch how you talk to me.” 
            8.         I indicated that I would set an OSC re:
monetary sanctions, and I proceeded to set a future continuance date and
address the check recipient issue.  Ms.
Kamath interrupted me several times, and I ordered her not to do so.  She repeated, “Don’t interrupt me,” and said
she was not attending any sanctions hearing. 
She indicated three to four times that she did not intend on attending
any sanctions hearing set by this Court. 
Ms. Kamath made a comment about, “All you male judges …,” the conclusion
of which I was not able to hear.
9.         After Mr. Kamath stated her intention to disobey a court
order to appear on the sanctions OSC, I stated that I intended to set a
contempt hearing.  Ms. Kamath said, “I
could care less about your orders.”  During this exchange, she also said, “I could
care less about your contempt.”  Ms.
Kamath indicated she would not be attending any contempt hearing, repeating it
a half dozen times.  I advised her she
should probably appear with counsel.
10.       Thereafter, I indicated I was putting this matter on second call.
Ms. Kamath said she was not waiting around another hour for the Court and she
had “better things to do.”  I ordered her
to remain in the courtroom and to remain on LACC.  I took a recess, went into chambers, and
allowed Ms. Kamath to calm down.  I reviewed
the Benchguide on Contempt of Court and returned within five to ten minutes and
discovered that Ms. Kamath had disconnected in my absence.  I inquired with my court staff, judicial
assistant Marisa Ventura and courtroom attendant Jaime Shuton, regarding any
technical issues on LACC which would have resulted in her involuntary
disconnection and they informed me there were none.  She did not make any attempts to reconnect.
11.       Because this incident escalated so quickly and without a court
reporter, the Court asked Mr. Atkins and Ms. Chmura to provide declarations as
to what they heard.  
12.       The incident was also heard by several parties and/or
attorneys who had been waiting for their matter to be called on LACC, including
Mr. Michael Klitzke, an attorney in an unrelated case (Case No. 22STCV29256) who
offered to act as a witness to what occurred. Many attorneys were also present,
either on LACC or in person, during this exchange, including the
following:  Richard Kim and Matthew
Learner in Case No. 23STCV03525, Scott Carr in Case No. 21STCV20431, Kenrick
Shoemaker and Christopher Urner in Case No. 23STCV21267, Chad Chapman and
Michael Klitzke in Case No. 23STCV29256, Brian Tan and D. Tucker Dowling in Case
No. 24STCV13259.  
13.       Also present on LACC was Certified Shorthand Reporter Vienna
Nguyen (#13137) who logged in during Ms. Kamath’s outbursts for an unrelated
later matter.  After I had returned to
the bench, Ms. Nguyen informed me she did not have a recording but that she
heard me order Ms. Kamath to remain, that Ms. Kamath said she was not going to
do so, and then she heard Ms. Kamath disconnect.
 
I declare under penalty of
perjury pursuant to the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is
true and correct.  
            
                        Executed
this 18th day of September 2024.
