And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the plaintiff's motions to compel further responses from the defendant are no longer needed and are therefore "moot". The plaintiff had filed suit against the defendant, alleging various claims, including violation of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act and fraud and deceit. The plaintiff had also moved to compel the defendant's further responses to special interrogatories and requests for production. After an informal discovery conference, the parties resolved their discovery dispute and the judge instructed them to file updated briefing if they still wanted the motions to be heard. However, no updated briefing was filed, leading the judge to conclude that all outstanding issues related to the motions have been resolved. As a result, the plaintiff's motions to compel further are moot and the judge has ordered them to be dismissed.
