And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' demurrer and motion to strike in a lawsuit filed by Valentina and Vahagn Asatryan against Sourik Gasparian and Manushak Sldryan. The defendants had demurred to the second and sixth causes of action, alleging that the plaintiffs had not sufficiently pleaded claims for concealment and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The judge overruled the demurrer, finding that the plaintiffs' allegations of concealment and intentional infliction of emotional distress were sufficient at the pleading stage. The judge also denied the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiffs' prayer for punitive damages, finding that the fraud cause of action was sufficiently pleaded.
