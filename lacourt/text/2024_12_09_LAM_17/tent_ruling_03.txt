 Hearing
  Date:  December 9, 2024




 
 
Plaintiff’s
motions to compel further are MOOT.
 
On
11/30/2023, Plaintiff Vincent Pantoja (Plaintiff) filed suit against Bargain
Rent-a-Car dba Lexus of Cerritos, alleging: (1) violation of the
Consumers Legal Remedies Act (CLRA); (2) fraud and deceit; (3) negligent
misrepresentation; (4) breach of implied warranty of merchantability; and (5)
violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200. 
 
            On
7/1/2024, Plaintiff moved to compel Defendant’s further responses to Special
Interrogatories (Set One) and to his Requests for Production (Set One). 
 
            On
9/11/2024, the Court conducted an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) for these
motions and the discovery dispute was resolved. The Court instructed the
parties that if counsel still wanted the motions to be heard, the parties were
to file updated briefing advising the Court as to what issues remained
unresolved.
 
            No
updated briefing was filed, and thus the Court concludes that all outstanding
issues related to these motions have been resolved. 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motions to compel further are moot. 
 
It is so ordered.
