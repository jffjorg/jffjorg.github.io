And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Cross-Defendants. The Court has overruled the demurrer to the fraud and elder abuse causes of action, finding that Cross-Complainants have alleged sufficient facts to support their claims. Specifically, the Court has found that Cross-Defendants' alleged misrepresentations on the rental application and failure to pay rent for over a year, as well as their failure to refund advances and refunds, constitute fraud and elder abuse. The Court has also denied Cross-Defendants' motion to strike, finding that Cross-Complainants have alleged sufficient facts to support their punitive damages prayer. The Court's tentative ruling is subject to change based on any submissions from the parties and will be adopted as the final order if all parties submit on the tentative.
