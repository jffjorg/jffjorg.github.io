And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The plaintiff, Dershay Woods-Boler, filed a lawsuit against the defendant, West Gardena Care Center, LLC dba West Gardena Post Acute, alleging various forms of discrimination and retaliation. The defendant moved to compel arbitration, arguing that the plaintiff agreed to arbitration in her employment application and signed an arbitration agreement in May 2021. The judge finds that the defendant has established by a preponderance of the evidence that an arbitration agreement exists and that the plaintiff's claims are covered by that agreement. The burden now shifts to the plaintiff to establish that the arbitration clause should not be enforced. Since the plaintiff has not filed a opposition to the motion, the judge grants the motion and compels arbitration.
