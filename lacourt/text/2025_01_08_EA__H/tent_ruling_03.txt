   [FN1] The Court has  reviewed and considered Plaintiffs’ opposition but notes that the  opposition does not address the substantive issues raised by Defendants’  demurrer.[FN2] Exhibit 28 purportedly references Cheng “admit[ting  to] monitoring Plaintiffs for a long time with some cleaning lady. The  wheelchair was needed in the wheelchair lift because Plaintiff Alice Lu had  some bone fractures. The wheelchair LIFT was inside of the two-unit Exclusive  Area, not in a public common area.” (SAC, ¶ 44(a).) However, Exhibit 28  specifically states that HOA did not enter the premise. (Id., Exhibit  28.) [FN3] The Court notes that  while this paragraph is numbered 48(VII), it should be numbered “(VIII),” as  the previous paragraph is also labeled “(VII).”
