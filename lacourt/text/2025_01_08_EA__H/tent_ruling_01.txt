ORDER ON MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE AMENDED ANSWER
Defendants Roberto Cuevas and FBD
Vanguard’s unopposed Motion for Leave to File Amended Answer is GRANTED.

 
Background 
Plaintiff
Andrew Morales (“Plaintiff”) alleges that he sustained injuries and damages in
a December 16, 2021 motor vehicle collision on the 60 freeway. 
On November 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint,
asserting causes of action against Roberto Cuevas (“Cuevas”), FBD Vanguard
Construction, Inc. (“FBD”), and Does 1-25 for (1) motor vehicle and (2) general
negligence. 
Pending before the Court is Defendants’ motion for
leave to file an amended answer.
 
Legal Standard
“The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms
as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading…” (Code Civ. Proc., §
473, subd. (a)(1); and see § 576 [“Any judge, at any time before or after
commencement of trial, in the furtherance of justice, and upon such terms as
may be proper, may allow the amendment of any pleading or pretrial conference
order”].)
“[T]he trial court has wide discretion in allowing the
amendment of any pleading.” (Bedolla v.
Logan & Frazer (1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 118, 135.) “[I]t is irrelevant that
new legal theories are introduced as long as the proposed amendments relate to
the same general set of facts.” (Kittredge
Sports Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048 [quotation
marks and citation omitted].) “[E]ven if the proposed legal theory is a novel
one, the preferable practice would be to permit the amendment and allow the
parties to test its legal
sufficiency by demurrer, motion for judgment on the pleadings or other
appropriate proceedings.” (Id. [quotation marks and citation omitted].) With
that said, “the failure of a proposed amendment to state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action or defense may support an order denying a motion
to amend.” (California Casualty Gen. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985)
173 Cal.App.3d 274, 280, disapproved of on other grounds in Kransco v.
American Empire Surplus Lines Ins. Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 390.)
Courts
must apply a policy of great liberality in permitting amendments to pleadings
at any stage of the proceedings, up to and including trial, when no prejudice
is shown to the adverse party. (Atkinson
v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761.) However, “even if a good
amendment is proposed in proper form, unwarranted delay in presenting it may—of
itself—be a valid reason for denial. . . denial may rest upon the element of
lack of diligence in offering the amendment after knowledge of the facts, or the
effect of the delay on the adverse party.” (Roemer
v. Retail Credit Co. (1975) 44 Cal.App.3d 926, 940.)
Also,
“[a] motion to amend a pleading before trial must: (1) Include a copy of the
proposed amendment or amended pleading, which must be serially numbered to
differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments; (2) State what
allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any, and
where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the deleted allegations are
located; and (3) State what allegations are proposed to be added to the
previous pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the
additional allegations are located.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(a).)
Additionally,
“[a] separate declaration must accompany the motion and must specify: (1) The
effect of the amendment; (2) Why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3)
When the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4)
The reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324(b).)
 
Discussion
Cuevas
and FBD move the Court for leave to file an amended answer to include
Proposition 213.
Elizabeth
McKinney (“McKinney”), counsel for Cuevas and FBD, represents as follows:
          Plaintiff’s complaint filed November
29, 2023 seeks past and future general and special damages. (McKinney Decl., ¶
4.) Cuevas and FBD filed their answer on May 24, 2024. (Id., ¶ 5, Exh.
2.) On November 4, 2024, Cuevas and FBD became aware, through Plaintiff’s
discovery responses, that Plaintiff did not have car insurance at the time of
the accident. (Id., ¶ 6, Exh. 3.) On November 7, 2024, counsel met and
conferred about Cuevas and FBD amending their answer to include Proposition 213
as an affirmative defense. (Id., ¶ 7, Exh. 4.) Plaintiff’s counsel, Vick
Petrosian, agreed to stipulate to an amended answer. (Id.)
Based
on the aforementioned showing and the Court’s determination that the motion
complies with California Rules of Court rule 3.1324, the motion is granted.
