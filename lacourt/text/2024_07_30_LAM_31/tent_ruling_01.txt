MOTION
FOR APPROVAL OF REPRESENTATIVE ACTION SETTLEMENT



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Sabrina Carrion, as an aggrieved employee, and on behalf of all other aggrieved
employees
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            On March 27,
2023, Plaintiff Sabrina Carrion filed this action against Defendants Clutter,
Inc. and Charles Robertson for penalties under the Private Attorney General Act
(“PAGA”). 
 
            The parties
have agreed on the terms of a settlement. 
Under the proposed settlement, Defendants will pay a Gross Settlement
Amount of $570,000.  Of that amount, up to $199,500 will be paid as
attorney fees, $20,350.85 will be paid for reimbursement of litigation
expenses, up to $7,500 will be paid to Plaintiff as a PAGA Representative
Service Payment, and up to $7,950.00 will be paid to a settlement administrator,
leaving a PAGA Settlement Amount of $334,699.15.  (Chang Decl., Ex. 1, ¶
3.1.)  From the PAGA Settlement Amount, 75 percent (or $251,024.36) will
be paid to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (“LWDA”) and 25 percent (approximately
$64.17 [$83,674.79/1,304 aggrieved employees) will be paid to the aggrieved
employees on a pro rata basis.   
 
II.        DISCUSSION
 
A court must review and approve any penalties sought as part
of a proposed settlement agreement pursuant to Labor Code section 2699. 
(Lab. Code § 2699, subd. (l).)  “[C]ivil penalties recovered by
aggrieved employees shall be distributed as follows: 75 percent to the Labor
and Workforce Development Agency for enforcement of labor laws and education of
employers and employees about their rights and responsibilities under this
code, to be continuously appropriated to supplement and not supplant the
funding to the agency for those purposes; and 25 percent to the aggrieved
employees.”  (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (i).)  
 
A.        Plaintiff
Has Provided Notice of the Settlement to LWDA. 
 
A proposed PAGA settlement must be submitted to LWDA at the
same time that it is submitted to the court for review and approval. 
(Lab. Code § 2699, subd. (l)(2).)  Plaintiff’s counsel attaches proof that
the settlement was submitted to the LWDA on May 31, 2024—before the motion was
filed.  (Chang Decl., Ex. 6.) 
 
Accordingly, the Court finds that this requirement is not
satisfied. 
 
B.        The
Settlement is Entitled to a Presumption of Fairness. 
 
A presumption of fairness¿for a settlement agreement exists
where: (1) the settlement is reached through arm’s-length bargaining; (2)
investigation and discovery are sufficient to allow counsel and the court to
act intelligently; (3) counsel is experienced in similar litigation; and (4)
the percentage of objectors is small.  (Dunk v. Ford Motor Co.¿(1996)
48 Cal.App.4th 1794, 1802.)  The final factor does not apply to
PAGA.  (See Arias v. Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th 969, 984
[representative actions under PAGA do not violate the due process rights of
“nonparty aggrieved employees who are not given notice of, and an opportunity
to be heard”].) 
 
On February 7, 2024, the parties attended a full day
mediation session with mediator Jeffrey A. Ross, esq., where they reached a
settlement.  (Chang Decl. ¶¶ 15, 20.)  The settlement was therefore
reached through arm’s-length bargaining. 
            
The parties engaged in discovery regarding Defendants’
policies, practices, time and payroll information of approximately 1,304
aggrieved employees, Plaintiff’s personnel file (including time and payroll
data for Plaintiff).  (Chang Decl. ¶ 18.)  Accordingly, there was
sufficient investigation to allow counsel and the Court to act
intelligently. 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel “are experienced litigators who
specialize in employment law, with a substantial PAGA and wage and hour class
action practice.”  (Chang Decl., ¶ 62.)
 
The Court finds that the settlement is entitled to a
presumption of fairness. 
 
C.        The
Release is Permissible. 
 
If the Court approves the PAGA settlement, the aggrieved
employees will release “all claims, rights, demands, liabilities and causes of
action that arose during the PAGA Period for civil penalties under PAGA that
were alleged, or reasonably could have been alleged, based on the facts stated
in the Operative Complaint and the PAGA Notice for PAGA civil penalties.” 
On only her own behalf, Plaintiff also waives the protections of Civil Code
section 1542.  This release is limited to claims for civil penalties that
arise from or relate to allegations in Plaintiff’s Complaint in this action,
and it is permissible. 
 
D.        The Attorney
Fees and Costs Are Reasonable. 
 
A prevailing employee is entitled to an award of reasonable
attorney fees and costs incurred in the action.  (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd.
(g)(1).)  Plaintiff’s counsel will receive up to 35% of the PAGA Settlement
Amount for attorney fees (estimated at $199,500.00) and up to $5,000.00 in
costs and expenses from the PAGA Settlement Amount.  (Chang Decl., Ex. 1,
¶ 3.2.2.) 
 
The Court finds that the attorney fees and costs are
reasonable. 
 
III.       CONCLUSION 
 
The motion for approval of PAGA settlement is GRANTED. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
