The settlement was reached between Plaintiff Sabrina Carrion and Defendants Clutter Inc. and Charles Robertson. The settlement provides for a gross settlement amount of $570,000, with up to $199,500 to be paid as attorney fees, $20,350.85 for reimbursement of litigation expenses, and up to $7,500 for a PAGA Representative Service Payment. The remaining amount will be paid to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (75%) and the aggrieved employees (25%) on a pro rata basis. The Court found that the settlement is entitled to a presumption of fairness and that the release of claims is permissible. The Court also found that the attorney fees and costs are reasonable. The motion for approval of the PAGA settlement is therefore granted."
