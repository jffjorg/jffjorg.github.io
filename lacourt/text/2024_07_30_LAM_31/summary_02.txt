English-text summary:

The Judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Ford Motor Company to the complaint filed by Concepcion Morales Ledesma. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the complaint and argues that the Song-Beverly Act's express warranty provisions apply only to new vehicles, not used vehicles. The Judge is inclined to stay the case for 180 days pending the resolution of the case Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC, which is currently before the California Supreme Court. The Judge also sustains Ford's demurrer to the plaintiff's fraudulent concealment claim, finding that Ford did not have a duty to disclose material facts to the plaintiff.
