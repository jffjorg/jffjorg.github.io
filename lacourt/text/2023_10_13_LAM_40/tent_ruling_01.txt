 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant Los
  Angeles Unified School District’s Demurrer to Second Amended Complaint.



 
 
Background
Plaintiff LL Jane Doe BC sues Defendants Los Angeles Unified School
District (LAUSD) and Does 2 through 100 pursuant to an August 8, 2023 Complaint
alleging claims of (1) Negligence and (2) Negligent Hiring, Supervision, and
Retention.
The claims arise from allegations that, in the mid-1970s, Plaintiff Doe
suffered childhood sexual abuse and exploitation at the hands of Defendants’
teacher, coach, and employee, Webster Johnson. The Complaint alleges that Defendants
knew or should have known Mr. Johnson posed a danger to Plaintiff and other
children—e.g., through complaints received by LAUSD regarding inappropriate
conduct and other molestations by Mr. Johnson (alleged based on information and
belief). The Complaint also alleges that, despite this knowledge, Defendants failed
to take reasonable steps to protect Plaintiff from the danger of being sexually
abused by Mr. Johnson, thus allowing Mr. Johnson to use his position as a
teacher, coach, and employee with Defendants to repeatedly sexually abuse
Plaintiff.
On August 14, 2023, LAUSD filed a meet and confer declaration.
On August 15, 2023 LAUSD filed its demurrer.
On September 21, 2023, LAUSD amended its demurrer.
 
On October 2, 2023, Plaintiff Doe opposed the demurrer.
On October 4, 2023, LAUSD filed a stipulation and proposed protective
order executed by the parties.
On October 5, 2023, the Court granted the stipulation and signed the
protective order.
On October 6, 2023, LAUSD replied to the opposition. 
 
Requests
for Judicial Notice
The Court takes judicial notice of
Exhibit 2 attached to the demurrer and Exhibits 1 to 5 attached to the
opposition, which are legislative documents subject to judicial notice. (RJN
Evid. Code, §§ 452, subd. (c), 453; see Amended Demurrer, RJN, pp. 1-2; Amended
Demurrer, Ex. 2; see also Opp’n, RJN, p. 1, Exs. 1-5.)

Sufficiency Standard
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (e).) This device can be used only to challenge defects that
appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the
pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a [general] demurrer, the complaint need only
allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that
might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A.
v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) In
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth
of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) A demurrer, however, “does not admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab
Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept.
of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other
grounds, Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th
1158, 1162.) The face of the complaint includes exhibits attached to the
complaint. (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.) If facts
appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits
take precedence. (Holland v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86
Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in White
v. Cridlebaugh (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 506, 521.)
First
and Second Causes of Action, Unconstitutional Gift of Public Money: OVERRULED.
LAUSD’s
demurrer boils down to a question of whether the causes of action stated in the
Complaint are insufficiently stated because the claims are based on an
unconstitutional law that violates a specific provision of the California
Constitution related to gift of public funds and because the claims do not fit
the applicable exception to that constitutional provision.
In
its demurrer, LAUSD argues that, as a matter of law, to permit this case to go
forward based on the legislature’s passage of AB 218 would constitute an
unconstitutional gift of public funds pursuant to Article XVI, section 6 of the
California Constitution (the gift clause). LAUSD cites various cases to argue that
the legislature does not have the power to create a liability against the state
for any past act of negligence given that the liability created would be a gift
of public funds. LAUSD argues that AB 218 violates the gift clause because it retroactively
strips statutory government immunity from public entities such as LAUSD by
eliminating the claims presentation requirement (Gov. Code, § 905, subd. (m))
for childhood sexual assault claims brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 340.1. LAUSD argues that because the claims presentation requirement
is, per case law, a substantive element of the Plaintiffs’ claim, the revival in
AB 218 is prohibited as a gift of public funds. (Amended Demurrer, pp. 5-6,
7-15.)
LAUSD
also argues that the public purpose exception to the gift of public funds
provision in the California constitution does not apply here because when the
legislature created a liability for LAUSD and other public entities where one
did not previously exist, the legislature created a private rather than public
purpose for the purposes of gifts of public funds. (Amended Demurrer, pp. 5-6, 15-17.)
In
opposition, Plaintiff argues that AB 218’s revival provision relating to Code
of Civil Procedure section 340.1 and Government Code section 905 is
constitutional based on the legislature’s power to determine how lawsuits can
be brought against the State and based on the claims presentation requirement
being a condition precedent to suit rather than an essential element of
liability against LAUSD. (Opp’n, pp. 2-5.)
Plaintiff
also argues that AB 218 is not a gift under the California constitution
pursuant to Coats v. New Haven Unified School Dist. (2020) 46
Cal.App.5th 415, 429 [“In Assembly Bill 218, the Legislature has again attempted
to balance the competing concerns of protecting public entities from stale
claims and allowing victims of childhood sexual abuse to seek compensation.
This time, the Legislature came to a different conclusion, with an express revival
provision for claims against public entities as well as those against private
defendants”].) In the alternative, Plaintiff argues that even if AB 218 is a
gift, it constitutes a public purpose, and that following LAUSD’s arguments
would lead to absurd results. (Opp’n, pp. 5-10.)
In
reply, LAUSD argues that Plaintiff must allege compliance with the claims-presentation
requirement or an excuse for presentation. LAUSD distinguishes the opposition
arguments. LAUSD also argues that a legislative appropriation for payment to an
individual in a claim for damages for which the State is not responsible by law
or by statute is a gift within the meaning of the California constitution, an
argument made in the moving papers. LAUSD also distinguishes Plaintiff’s law as
to this issue. Last, LAUSD rebuts the arguments that AB 218 fits within the
public purpose exception to the California constitution’s gift clause. (Reply,
pp. 3-11.)
After
review, the Court finds in favor of Plaintiff Doe.
The
Court relies on the documents submitted by Plaintiff for judicial notice and
makes the determination that even if AB 218 functions as an appropriation gifting
public funds—a determination the Court need not reach here—the public purpose
exception applies.
The
test for “whether or not a proposed application of public funds is to be deemed
a gift within the meaning [of the gift clause], … is … whether the money is to
be used for a public or a private purpose.” (City of Oakland v. Garrison
(1924) 194 Cal. 298, 302.) “The determination of what constitutes a public
purpose is primarily a matter for the Legislature to determine, and its
discretion will not be disturbed by the courts so long as that determination
has a reasonable basis. [Citations.]” (County of Alameda v. Carleson
(1971) 5 Cal.3d 730, 746.) Legislative findings are to be “given great weight
and will be upheld unless they are found to be unreasonable and arbitrary.
[Citations.]” (California Hous. Fin. Agency v. Elliot (1976) 17 Cal.3d
575, 583.)
Here,
the challenged portions of AB 218 (passed in 2020) appear to be two. First, the
legislature removed a portion of a 2008 amendment to Government Code section
905 (the claims requirement statute) that eliminated the claims presentation
requirement for childhood sexual abuse cases for conduct arising on or after
January 1, 2009. Second, the legislature added a new subsection to Government
Code section 905 making the changes to the statute retroactive. (Demurrer, pp.
10-11, citing Gov. Code, § 905, subds. (m), (p) as unconstitutional
modifications enacted by AB 218.)
Plaintiff
points to various expressly stated public purposes in passing these laws, such
as legislative comments that the law was passed, in part, to help prevent
future assaults by raising the cost for sexual assault of minors. Those same
comments provide that another purpose of the law is for the law to protect
victims of sexual assault rather than the perpetrators, who benefit from
statutes of limitations. The comments also provide that another purpose of AB
218 is to “confront the pervasive problem of cover ups of sexual abuse in
institutions, from schools to sports leagues, which result in continuing
victimization and the sexual assault of additional children.” (Opp’n, RJN, Ex.
2, AB 218 Concur in Senate Amendments
dated August 30, 2019, Comments.) Moreover, the comments provide that the
law will create “an effective deterrent against individuals and entities who
have chosen to protect the perpetrators of sexual assault over the victims.” (Id.)
The Court finds that these sufficiently state public
purposes for the passage of AB 218 by the Legislature.
In
reply, LAUSD argues that creating liability that did not previously exist and
thus involves an invalid claim serves no public purpose. LAUSD argues that AB
218 creates invalid claims by eliminating the substantive element of claim
presentation for suits involving personal injury against a local public entity.
However, the case law supported for this proposition is distinguishable. Conlin
v. Board of Supervisors of City and County and San Francisco (1893) 99 Cal.
17, 19-20, 23, for example, involved circumstances where the plaintiff was
attempting to collect payment from the city and county of San Francisco for
contractual work performed pursuant to a California law permitting that
collection. The Supreme Court of California found the law unconstitutional as
violative of the gift clause because the law created liability under
circumstances where the plaintiff’s contract clearly provided that the
plaintiff proceeded with the contract with the “express condition that in no
case would the city and county of San Francisco be liable for any portion of
the expense of the said work or improvement, or for any delinquency of persons
or property assessed.” Thus, the plaintiff in Conlin had no basis for
expecting compensation from the city or County of San Francisco from before the
time of injury, and the legislature simply created a liability that
contradicted the terms of the plaintiff’s contract. Here, by contrast, any
cause of action against Mr. Johnson accrued at the time the cause of action was
complete with all of its elements. (Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc.
(2005) 35 Cal.4th 797, 806-807.) Those elements, viewed in the light most
favorable to the pleadings, accrued at the time of the alleged abuse in the
1970s. The exposure to LAUSD would have been created at the same time under a
negligence or negligent supervision theory, such as here, subject to the claims
presentation requirements at the time. Moreover, in Shirk v. Vista Unified
School Dist. (2007) 42 Cal.4th 201, 213—a case cited by both parties—the
court noted that if the legislature “intended to … revive … the claim
representation requirement under the government claims statute, it could have
easily said so,” implying the legislature’s ability to make the changes it did
in AB 218 relating to subdivisions (m) and (p) in Government Code section 905.
LAUSD’s
demurrer is thus OVERRULED.

Conclusion
Defendant Los Angeles Unified
School District’s Demurrer to Second Amended Complaint is OVERRULED.
