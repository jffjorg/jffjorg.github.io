Summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on LAUSD's demurrer to Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint. The Plaintiff, LL Jane Doe BC, alleges childhood sexual abuse and exploitation by Webster Johnson, a teacher, coach, and employee of LAUSD, in the 1970s. LAUSD argues that the claims are based on an unconstitutional law, AB 218, which retroactively strips statutory government immunity from public entities like LAUSD by eliminating the claims presentation requirement for childhood sexual assault claims brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1. The Court finds that even if AB 218 functions as an appropriation gifting public funds, the public purpose exception applies. The Court relies on the documents submitted by Plaintiff for judicial notice and makes the determination that the challenged portions of AB 218 appear to be two: the removal of a portion of a 2008 amendment to Government Code section 905 that eliminated the claims presentation requirement for childhood sexual abuse cases for conduct arising on or after January 1, 2009, and the addition of a new subsection to Government Code section 905 making the changes to the statute retroactive. The Court finds that these sufficiently state public purposes for the passage of AB 218 by the Legislature. LAUSD's demurrer is thus overruled.
