And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to disqualify counsel brought by Costco Wholesale Corporation. The motion was filed on July 3, 2024, and the hearing was set for August 14, 2024. The judge has reviewed the arguments presented by both parties and has taken judicial notice of certain documents, including a conformed copy of the Elizabeth Grimes v. Costco Wholesale Corporation complaint.

The judge has found that while there is a potential conflict of interest, it is not sufficient to warrant disqualification. The judge has also taken into account the fact that the administrative employee responsible for finalizing and filing summons and complaints at Downtown L.A. Law Group made an error that led to the mistaken inclusion of Werbin on the complaint. The judge has determined that this error does not rise to the level of a conflict of interest and has denied the motion to disqualify counsel.

The judge has also refused to take judicial notice of the conformed copy of the Michael Schuman v. Sedigheh Ghaiemy-Mahdavy, et al. complaint, which was filed on August 12, 2024, as it was untimely and exceeded the deadline set by the court.
