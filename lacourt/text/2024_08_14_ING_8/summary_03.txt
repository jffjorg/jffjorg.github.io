And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a premises liability dispute between the plaintiff, Shela Carter, and the defendants, Marie Watson, Stephen Francis Watson, and Gregory James Wholey. The defendants have moved to compel the plaintiff's responses to discovery requests, including interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The plaintiff has failed to respond to these requests, which is a violation of the California Code of Civil Procedure.

The judge grants the defendants' motions to compel and orders the plaintiff to provide code-compliant, verified responses to the discovery requests by September 6, 2024. The judge also notes that the defendants have requested monetary sanctions in the amount of $561.65 per motion, but will need further proof from the defense counsel before awarding these sanctions.
