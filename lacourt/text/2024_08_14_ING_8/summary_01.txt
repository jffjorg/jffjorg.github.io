As for the summary, the Judge's tentative ruling is to grant summary adjudication to the Plaintiffs on their fourth cause of action for disgorgement of all sums paid to unlicensed contractors. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs have carried their initial burden in showing that the Defendants held themselves out as contractors for the purpose of doing business on the subject property, and that they did so after January of 2017 without a license. The Court also seeks argument from the Defendants as to whether it is a material fact requiring a trial as to whether the individuals paid for the work on the property were or were not employees of the Defendants. The Court's decision is dependent on the Defendants' answers to the questions raised by the Court.
