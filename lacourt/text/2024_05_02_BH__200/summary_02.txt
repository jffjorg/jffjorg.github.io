And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering the level of compliance required for a notice, specifically whether it must be strictly compliant or substantially compliant with the statute. The court notes that while the notice in Yeroushalmi was found deficient, the notice in Kintetsu was allowed to proceed despite some defects. The court also notes that agents' acts are considered acts of the principal, and attorneys are agents of the entity. The court finds that the statute is not clear and unambiguous, and therefore refers to other evidence to determine what the Legislature intended.
