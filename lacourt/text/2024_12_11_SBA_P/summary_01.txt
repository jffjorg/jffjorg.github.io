Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel binding arbitration and stay proceedings in this case. The plaintiff, Bret Lieberman, brought a complaint against the defendant, Tesla Motors, Inc., alleging five causes of action for violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The defendant argued that the parties had agreed to arbitration in the Motor Vehicle Order Agreement (MVOA) and that the court should compel binding arbitration and stay the proceedings.

The judge found that the MVOA is a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement and that the defendant had met its burden of proving the existence of the agreement. The judge also found that the arbitration agreement in the MVOA supersedes any other arbitration agreements that may have been entered into.

The judge noted that while the arbitration agreement may have some procedural unconscionability, it is not so one-sided that it would be substantively unconscionable to enforce it. The judge granted the motion to compel binding arbitration and stay proceedings, ordering the parties to arbitrate the dispute according to the terms of the MVOA.
