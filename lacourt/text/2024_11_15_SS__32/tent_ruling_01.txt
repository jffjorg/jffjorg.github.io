RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


November
  15, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


21STCV17364




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  for Terminating Sanctions   




MOVING PARTY:


Defendants Angie Enterprises, Inc. and
  First Bargain, Inc.




OPPOSING PARTY:


None
  



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Defendants Angie Enterprises, Inc. and First Bargain, Inc. (“Defendants”)
move for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff Olga Ochoa (“Plaintiff”) for
failure to comply with the Court’s July 17, 2024 discovery order. No opposition
has been filed.  
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“To
the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method
or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected
party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may
impose…sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the
discovery process.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 2023.030.) The court may impose a
terminating sanction for misuse of the discovery process by any of the
following: “(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings
of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process; (2) An order
staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed; (3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that
party; (4) An order rendering a judgment by default against that party.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(d).)  Failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery, or
disobeying
a court order to provide discovery, constitutes a
misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d), (g).)

 
“The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse
‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the
party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the
propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the
discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th
377, 390, quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 1225,
1246.)   
 
“Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be
made lightly.  But where a violation is
willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’” (Los
Defensores, supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390 [citation
omitted].)    
 
“Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating
sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders.”
(Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 citing Lang,
supra, 77 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244-1246 [discussing cases]; see, e.g., Collisson
& Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622
[terminating sanctions imposed (by striking the defendant’s Answer and
subsequently granting default judgment) after defendants failed to comply with
one court order to produce discovery]; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins.
Exchange (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 481, 491, disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen (1997) 16 Cal.4th
469, 478, n. 4 [terminating sanctions imposed against the plaintiff for failing
to comply with a discovery order and for violating various discovery
statutes].)  
 
“If a party then fails to obey an order compelling answers [to
interrogatories], the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (c).) 
 
“If a party then fails to obey the order compelling a response [to a
demand for production], the court may make those orders that are just,
including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
lieu of or in addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
On July 17,
2024, the Court granted Defendants’ unopposed motions to compel Demand for Production,
Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Form Interrogatories, Set One.
Plaintiff was ordered to provide verified responses without objection within 15
days. The Court also imposed $922.50 in monetary sanctions against Plaintiff
and her counsel, jointly and severally. (Min. Order, 7/17/24.) On the same day,
the Court granted Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be relieved. 
 
On
July 30, 2024, the Court signed the order granting Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion
to be relieved, effective upon filing proof of service of the order on
Plaintiff. The proof of service was filed on August 8, 2024. Plaintiff is
currently self-represented. 
 
On
August 26, 2024, Defendants served notice of the July 17, 2024 order via mail and
electronically, to Plaintiff’s address and email indicated on the Order
Relieving Counsel. 
 
Defendants
now move for terminating sanctions, arguing that Plaintiff has not complied
with the Court’s order by not serving responses. Defendants also indicate that
their counsel sent a letter to Plaintiff on August 1, 2024, informing her of
the Order and asking if she intended to get new counsel. (Garibyan Decl. ¶ 8,
Exh. G.) Plaintiff did not respond. On August 27, 2024, Defendants’ counsel
also had a telephone conversation with Plaintiff “wherein she advised that she
had no idea regarding any lawyer or any lawsuit.” (Id. ¶ 9.)
 
The proof
of service for this motion shows that Plaintiff was served via mail and
electronically, to Plaintiff’s address and email indicated on the Order
Relieving Counsel. 
 
Therefore,
based on Plaintiff’s failure to abide by the Court’s order, despite receiving
notice, the Court finds that Defendants are prevented from defending this case,
and that lesser sanctions have not induced compliance. Accordingly, the motion
for terminating sanctions is granted. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, Defendants Angie Enterprises, Inc. and First Bargain,
Inc.’s motion for terminating sanctions is GRANTED. The complaint as to Defendants Angie
Enterprises, Inc. and First Bargain, Inc. is dismissed without prejudice. As the only remaining
defendants are unnamed Doe defendants, the Court dismisses the entirety of the
complaint. All dates are advanced and vacated.¿
 
Moving party shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a
proof of service of such.
