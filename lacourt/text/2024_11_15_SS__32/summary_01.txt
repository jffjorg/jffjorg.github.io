And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants' motion for terminating sanctions against the plaintiff, Olga Ochoa. The defendants, Angie Enterprises, Inc. and First Bargain, Inc., had previously moved for terminating sanctions against the plaintiff for failing to comply with a discovery order. The plaintiff had been ordered to provide verified responses to discovery requests, but had failed to do so despite receiving notice.

The judge found that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the discovery order was willful and that lesser sanctions had not induced compliance. Therefore, the judge granted the defendants' motion and dismissed the complaint without prejudice as to the defendants, Angie Enterprises, Inc. and First Bargain, Inc. The judge also dismissed the entirety of the complaint since the only remaining defendants were unnamed Doe defendants. All dates were advanced and vacated. The moving party is required to provide notice of the ruling and file a proof of service.
