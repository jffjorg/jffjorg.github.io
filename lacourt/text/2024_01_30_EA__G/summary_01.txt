```

Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants L.R.'s motion for summary adjudication on the issue of duty, holding that WVUSD and Arzola owed a duty to protect L.R. from sexual assault in school restrooms due to L.R.'s vulnerable status as a special needs student. However, the court denies L.R.'s motion for summary adjudication on the issues of breach and causation, finding that these issues are better suited for jury determination. The court concludes that the duty of care owed by WVUSD and Arzola to L.R. arises from their special relationship with L.R. and the foreseeability of harm to L.R. while alone in school restrooms.
