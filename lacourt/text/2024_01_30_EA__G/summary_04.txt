```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Donald Turner against Plaintiff Hector Serna's complaint. The court finds that the parties did not adequately meet and confer before the demurrer was filed, as the defendant's counsel only sent a letter to the plaintiff's counsel instead of attempting to meet and confer in person or by telephone. As a result, the court has ordered the demurrer to be continued to a date to be determined at a hearing in Department G (Pomona). The defendant's counsel is also ordered to meet and confer with the plaintiff regarding the demurrer and to file a supplemental declaration describing such meet and confer efforts at least nine court days before the next scheduled hearing on the demurrer.
