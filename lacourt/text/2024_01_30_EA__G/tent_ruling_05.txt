TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiffs Donald G. McWhirter, Jr. and Carolynn T.
McWhirter’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
BACKGROUND
On
January 9, 2024, Plaintiffs Donald G. McWhirter, Jr. and Carolynn T. McWhirter
filed a complaint against Defendant Anthony J. Venti, Jr., individually and as
trustee of the Venti, Jr. Family Trust, dated May 31, 1990 (Venti Trust), and
Does 1-10, alleging the following causes of action: (1) quiet title, (2)
declaratory relief, and (3) accounting.
On January
11, 2024, the McWhirters filed the present motion. A hearing on their motion is
set for January 30 with a case management conference and OSC Re: Failure to
File Proof of Service set for June 3.
ANALYSIS
The
McWhirters seek a preliminary injunction to halt the pending foreclosure of
their personal residence. For the following reasons, the court DENIES
WITHOUT PREJUDICE their motion.
Legal
Standard
California
Rules of Court 3.1150(a) provides in relevant part: “An OSC must be
used . . . if the party against whom the preliminary injunction is sought has
not appeared in the action.  If the
responding party has not appeared, the OSC must by served in the same manner as
a summons and complaint.”
Service on Defendants
Here, the McWhirters failed
to file a proof of service with the court demonstrating that they served the
OSC as required by California Rules of Court 3.1150(a).  Since Defendants have not yet appeared in the case, Plaintiffs were required to comply with California Rules of Court 3.1150(a).   
Accordingly, the McWhirters’
motion is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
Additionally, the court notes
that Plaintiffs did not file a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) along with an
OSC re: Preliminary Injunction so that the court could act to maintain the
status quo while Plaintiffs’ served Defendants as required by California
Rules of Court 3.1150(a).
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the McWhirters’
motion for a preliminary injunction is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
