And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling from the judge grants the defendant's motion to set aside the entry of default and permit the filing of an answer to the first amended complaint. The plaintiff, Ernesto Galvez, had filed a first amended complaint against the defendant, A Caring Touch Board And Care III LLC, alleging constructive termination due to lack of meal and rest breaks, unpaid overtime, and harassment based on sexual orientation. The court had entered default against the defendant, but the defendant had been in settlement negotiations with the plaintiff, which led to a delay in filing an answer. The court finds that the settlement negotiations are a satisfactory excuse for the delay in filing the answer and grants the defendant's motion. However, the court also notes that it is prepared to dismiss the case entirely due to the plaintiff's failure to seek default judgment.
