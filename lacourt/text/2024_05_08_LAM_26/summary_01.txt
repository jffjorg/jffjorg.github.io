And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has denied Defendant Daimler Trucks North America, LLC's Motion to Strike the allegations of punitive damages and prejudgment interest in the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The Court found that the Complaint pleads sufficient facts to support the claims for punitive damages and prejudgment interest. Specifically, the Court found that the Complaint alleges that Daimler Trucks North America, LLC knew that the sleeper compartment of their truck was not safe and causes occupants to suffer catastrophic injury in side impacts and rollover incidents, and that the company continued to produce, market, and sell the subject vehicle despite this knowledge. The Court concluded that a jury could reasonably find that Daimler Trucks North America, LLC acted with conscious disregard for the safety of others in continuing to produce, market, and design the subject vehicle with the purported defect.
