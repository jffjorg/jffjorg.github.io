[TENTATIVE] order RE:
MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
 



 
Background
            On
October 10, 2022, Plaintiff Howard Lee (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against
Defendants JJMG Management, a dissolved California corporation; Joseph Tang aka
Chungjeng Tang, an individual; Jojo Jing Zhong, an individual; and DOES 1
through 20, inclusive for: (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Fraud; and (3) Money Had
and Received. 
            On January 6, 2023, Defendant Joseph
Tang filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff and ROES 1 through 100,
inclusive for Declaratory Relief. 
            On January 26, 2023, default was
entered against Defendant JJMG Management, a dissolved California corporation. 
            On March 27, 2024, Defendant Jojo
Jing Zhong’s counsel of record, Christophe D. Lee, Esq. filed the instant
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel. 
 
Legal Standard
The
court may order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before
or after judgment or final determination upon request by either client or
attorney and after notice from one to the other. (Code Civ. Proc., § 284(2).)
“The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel
lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine
v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
An
application to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form
MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362(a)),
MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362(c)), and MC-053
(Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362(e)). The proposed order must
specify all hearing dates scheduled in the action or proceeding, including the
date of trial, if known. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362(e).)   
Further,
the requisite forms must be served on the client and all other parties who have
appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362(d).) The court may
delay the effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service
of a copy of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court.
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362(e).) A motion to withdraw will not be granted
where withdrawal would prejudice the client. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant
(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.) 
 
Discussion
Counsel has filed the MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053 forms pursuant to
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362. 
Counsel served Defendant Zhong by mail at his last known address, which
Counsel states was confirmed within the past 30 days as current through
Defendant Tang. 
Counsel declares that representation cannot continue because the
attorney-client relationship has been breached as Counsel is unable to contact
or communicate with Defendant Zhong since late January 2024. Counsel further
states he has tried to reach Defendant Zhong via email and telephone, but to no
avail. 
Counsel also filed proof of service indicating that the requisite forms
were served on Defendant Zhong and all other parties who have appeared in this
case. Furthermore, it appears from the court record that Defendant Zhong has
filed a substitution of attorney. 
Finally, the proposed order on form MC053 includes all the hearings
scheduled in this matter as follows:
 
1.     
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel set for 5/8/24;
2.     
OSC Re: Dismissal & Hearing on Motion for Summary Judgment set for
5/22/24;
3.     
Final Status Conference set for 9/11/24; and
4.     
Jury Trial set for 9/23/24
Therefore, Counsel has complied with the requirements of California
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362.
 
Conclusion and ORDER
            Counsel Christopher D. Lee, Esq.’s
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED. 
            Moving Party to give notice within
seven (7) days.
