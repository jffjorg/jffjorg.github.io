And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion filed by counsel for the plaintiffs to allow T. Patton Youngblood, Jr. to appear as counsel pro hac vice in the case. The motion was filed on January 8, 2024, and no opposition was filed. The judge reviewed the moving papers and found that Youngblood is admitted to practice in good standing before at least one U.S. court, is associated with an attorney of record who is a member of the California Bar, and has paid the required $50 State Bar fee. The judge granted the motion because counsel for the plaintiffs have met the requirements under California Rules of Court, Rule 9.40. The judge ordered the moving party to give notice of the ruling.
