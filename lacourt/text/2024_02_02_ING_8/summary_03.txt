And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Court sustains Defendant Maruchan's demurrer and moots the Motion to Strike. The demurrer argues that Plaintiff Calsafe Research Center, Inc.'s First Amended Complaint (FAC) fails to state a cause of action against Maruchan because it failed to serve a legally compliant pre-suit 60-day notice of violation and did not comply with California Code of Regulations, title 27, § 25903(b)(2)(C). The FAC also fails to provide information regarding Stater Bros. Market's allegations of liability, making the notice uncertain.

The Court notes that the notice requirements are not in compliance, and the FAC's failure to provide a 60-day notice of violation is a mandatory prerequisite to confer authority on a private plaintiff to file a private action to enforce Proposition 65. The Court will consider oral argument as to whether leave to amend will be granted.

The Court orders Defendant Maruchan to give notice of the sustained demurrer and mooted Motion to Strike.
