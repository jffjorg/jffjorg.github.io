Nickell, et al.MOVING PARTY: Cross-Defendant, Charles Toby Andrews dba Andrews General ConstructionRESPONDING PARTY: Defendant/Cross-Complainant, Robert P. NickellTRIAL DATE: June 24, 2024MOTION: (1) Demurrer to FAXCTentative Rulings: (1) SUSTAINED with 20 days leave to amendI. BACKGROUNDA. FactualPlaintiff Luann Fabian (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant Robert Nickell (“Defendant”) on October 15, 2020, alleging causes of action for breach of contract and common count. Plaintiff alleges that on March 8, 2018, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a promissory note for $311,276.81 with interest of 9% per annum. Defendant is alleged to have breached the note by failing to pay the principal and accrued interest. Predating this agreement, the parties entered into a Development Contract on August 1, 2013 for a construction project at Defendant’s home.At the same time he answered the Complaint, Defendant filed a Cross-Complaint alleging causes of action stemming from the 2013 development contract. On November 27, 2023, Cross-Complainant filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint (“FAXC”) alleging causes of action for (1) breach of contract, (2) violation of Bus. & Prof. Code § 7107, (3) violation of Bus. & Prof. Code § 7113, (4) violation of Bus. & Prof. Code § 7028, (5) violation of Bus. & Prof. Code § 7109, (6) fraudulent inducement, (7) unjust enrichment, and (8) declaratory relief.Cross-Defendant, Charles Toby Andrews dba Andrews General Construction (“Andrews”) now brings a Demurrer to the FAXC.B. ProceduralOn December 29, 2023, Andrews filed this demurrer to Cross-Complainant’s FAXC. On January 22, 2024, Cross-Complainant filed an opposition which in substance is not an opposition (it concedes there were deficiencies in the FAXC that counsel agreed to rectify) but instead is a Request for Leave to File a Second-Amended Cross-Complaint. On January 26, 2023, Andrews filed a reply brief.II. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICEAlong with Andrews’ reply brief, he included a request for this Court to take Judicial Notice of the following documents:1. Declaration of Luann Fabian in Support of Cross-Defendant’s Opposition to CrossComplainant Robert P. Nickell’s Motion for Summary Adjudication, filed on July 13, 2023;2. Cross-Complainant Robert P. Nickell’s First Amended Cross-Complaint, filed on November 27, 20233. Andrews’ Demurrer to Cross-Complainant Robert P. Nickell’s First Amended Cross-Complaint, filed on December 29, 2023; The Court may take judicial notice of the records of any court of this state. Evid. Code § 452(c), (d); see also Mead v. Sanwa Bank Cal., 61 Cal. App. 4th 561, 567 (1998); Nulaid Farmers Ass’n v. La Torre, 252 Cal. App. 2d 788, 791 (1967).The Court GRANTS Cross-Defendant Andrews’ request and takes judicial notice of the above documents.III. ANALYSISA. DemurrerLegal StandardA demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿A pleading is uncertain if it is ambiguous or unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f).) A demurrer for uncertainty may lie if the failure to label the parties and claims renders the complaint so confusing defendant cannot tell what he or she is supposed to respond to.¿ (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.) However, “[a] demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, becauseambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)DiscussionHere, Cross-Complainant asserts in his opposition that the parties met and conferred and counsel for Cross-Complainant, Nickell agreed that the FAXC needed to be revised, and that he agreed to amend the pleading. However, Nickell asserts that the demurrer was nonetheless filed less than an hour later. Nickell concedes in the “opposition” that the FAXC requires amending and that he conceded as such during the meet-and-confer process.Andrews, in his reply brief, argues that Nickell should not be granted leave to amend as Nickell cannot proffer any additional facts to state any valid claim against Andrews. Andrews further argues that the proposed Second Amended Cross-Complaint does not cure the demurrable deficiencies but instead seeks to present two new causes of action as to which Andrews contends are efforts to re-characterize and re-label defective allegations in the FAXC. The Court declines the invitation to treat this demurrer to the FAXC as a hearing on a motion for leave to file a second amended Cross-Complaint, a motion which is not properly before the Court. Instead, the Court will sustain the Demurrer and grant 20 days leave to amend. Any claimed defects in the second amended cross-complaint will be addressed at a future hearing.
