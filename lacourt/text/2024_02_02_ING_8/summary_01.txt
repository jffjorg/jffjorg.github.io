And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is in regards to a demurrer filed by Cross-Defendant Charles Toby Andrews dba Andrews General Construction to the First Amended Cross-Complaint filed by Defendant/Cross-Complainant Robert P. Nickell. The Court grants the demurrer and sustains it with 20 days leave to amend. The demurrer was filed despite the parties having agreed to rectify deficiencies in the First Amended Cross-Complaint during a meet-and-confer process. The Court declines to treat the demurrer as a hearing on a motion for leave to file a second amended Cross-Complaint, and instead allows the Defendant/Cross-Complainant to file a second amended pleading to address any remaining defects.
