I.          INTRODUCTION 
 
This is a breach of contract case concerning real
property.  On September 28, 2021,
Plaintiff, The Redeemed Christian Church of God-Jesus Embassy Los Angeles,
filed a complaint against Defendants, Swift Petrochemicals, Inc. and Mutiu
Olatunji Durosinmi-Etti.  
 
On
October 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed the Third Amended Complaint alleging causes of
action for (1)¿Breach of Contract, (2)¿Promissory Estoppel, (3)¿Breach of the
Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (4)¿Declaratory Relief, (5)¿Constructive
Trust, and (6)¿Fraud.   
 
On March 4, 2024, the court sustained Defendants’ demurrer
to the promissory estoppel cause of action without leave to amend and sustained
the demurrer to all other causes of action with leave to amend.  
 
On April 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative Fourth
Amended Complaint (FAC) for (1)¿Breach of Contract, (2)¿Breach of the Implied
Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (3)¿Declaratory Relief,
(4)¿Constructive Trust, and (5)¿Fraud.   
  
On July 24, 2024, the court overruled the demurrer to the
FAC.  Defendants were ordered to serve
and file their answer to the FAC within 15 days of the date of the order. 
¿ 
On
August 13, 2024, the court granted Defendants’ ex parte application to extend
time to answer the FAC.  Defendants were
given until September 12, 2024 to file their answer.
 
On
September 9, 2024, Defendants retained Raymond Obiamalu to serve as co-counsel
for Defendants with current defense counsel Alaba Ajetunmobi.  The next day, Mr. Obiamalu and Mr. Ajetunmobi
appeared for a Case Management Conference.
 
On
September 13, 2024, after Defendants did not file their answer, Plaintiff
requested entry of default against Defendants.  Default was entered against Defendants on the
same day.
 
On
September 23, 2024, Defendants filed a Notice of Association of Counsel to
formally inform the court that Mr. Obiamalu had associated as co-defense
counsel.
 
On
October 1, 2024, Defendants filed a Substitution of Attorney relieving Mr.
Ajetunmobi as co-counsel for Defendants in this lawsuit.
 
On
October 11, 2024, Defendants filed this Motion to Set Aside Default and Default
Judgment, If Entered: CCP § 473(b).
 
On December 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition.
 
On December 31, 2024, Defendants replied.
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b)
provides that a court may “relieve a party or his or her legal representative
from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.”¿ In
addition, a court must vacate a default or dismissal when a motion for relief
under Section 473, subdivision (b) is filed timely and accompanied by an
attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect “unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was
not in fact caused by the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or
neglect.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)¿¿¿ 
 
The party or the legal representative must seek such relief
“within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd.
(b); see Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 980 [“because more
than six months had elapsed from the entry of default, and hence relief under
section 473 was unavailable”]; People v. The North River Ins. Co. (2011)
200 Cal.App.4th 712, 721 [motion for relief under section 473 must be brought
“within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months”].)¿ 
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
Defendants seek relief to vacate the default on the grounds
that Defendants’ counsel Mr. Obiamalu operated under the mistaken
assumption that Defendants’ (now former) counsel Mr. Ajetunmobi would be filing
the answer to the FAC.  (Obiamalu Decl., ¶ 4.)  For this reason, Defendants argue their failure
to timely answer the FAC was the result of his counsel’s mistake, inadvertence,
surprise and excusable neglect.   
Plaintiff contends that Defendants grounds for relief does not
constitute mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  The court disagrees.  “Within the context of section 473(b) neglect
is excusable if a reasonably prudent person under similar circumstances might
have made the same error.”  (Austin v.
Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 918, 929.)  Here, Mr. Obiamalu has represented Defendants
in this matter since June 26, 2023.  (See
Substitution of Attorney, 6/26/23.)  Later,
Defendants retained Mr. Obiamalu on September 10,
2024, just two days before Defendants’ answer was due.  Under these circumstances, a reasonably
prudent person would have assumed Mr. Ajetunmobi would prepare and file the
answer.  The court finds the failure to
timely serve and file an answer to the FAC was due to excusable neglect.
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            Based on the foregoing, the motion to set aside default is GRANTED.
 The default entered against Defendants
on September 13, 2024 is VACATED. 
Defendants’ proposed answer is deemed filed as of this date.  The
court further directs Defendants to separately file their answer with the court
within the next five court days. 
 
Moving party to give notice, unless waived.
