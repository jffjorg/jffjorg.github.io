And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a demurrer filed by Ford Motor Company to the complaint of Concepcion Morales Ledesma, alleging fraudulent concealment. Ford argues that the claim is not sufficiently pled and is barred by the economic loss rule. The court finds that Ford's argument regarding the duty to disclose is dispositive and that there is no direct transactional relationship between Ford and the plaintiff. The court is inclined to sustain Ford's demurrer to the fifth cause of action, but will first hear from the parties regarding the impact of the California Supreme Court's opinion in Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC. The court will also consider the parties' arguments regarding the status of the plaintiff's Song-Beverly claims.
