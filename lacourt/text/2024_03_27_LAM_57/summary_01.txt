And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting two motions brought by the Plaintiff: one to compel further responses to a request for production of documents, and another to compel further responses to form interrogatories. The Judge found that the Defendant, A&J Global Investment (Pomona) LP, failed to file a proper opposition to both motions, submitting only a declaration from its counsel that did not aid its case. The Judge also found that the Defendant's answers to the interrogatories were incomplete and evasive, and that its counsel failed to label documents as required by the Code of Civil Procedure. As a result, the Judge is imposing sanctions against the Defendant and its counsel in the amount of $3980, reflecting the amount of attorney's fees and costs incurred by the Plaintiff. The Judge is also granting the Plaintiff's motions to compel further responses, and reducing the amount of sanctions for the motion related to interrogatories by half due to the substantial overlap between the preparation of the two motions.
