And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint. The demurrer is overruled in part, as the plaintiff, Nibble This, LLC, has standing to assert the first, second, third, and fifth causes of action. However, the demurrer is sustained in part, as the plaintiff lacks standing to assert the fifth cause of action for tortious interference with contracts. The demurrer is also sustained with leave to amend on the second cause of action for breach of the fiduciary duty of care, as the plaintiff failed to allege actual damages resulting from the breach. Additionally, the demurrer is sustained with leave to amend on the sixth cause of action for fraud, as the statute of limitations has barred the claim. The motion to strike is denied as moot and on its substance, as the allegations targeted by the motion are not relevant to the remaining causes of action.
