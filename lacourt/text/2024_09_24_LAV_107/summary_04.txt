And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the Petition and Declaration Regarding Unresolved Claims and Deposit of Undistributed Surplus Proceeds of Trustee's Sale is granted. The amount of $64,534.29, which is the remaining surplus proceeds from the sale of the property, will be deposited with the court. The judge has determined that there is a conflict between potential claimants to the surplus proceeds and that the trustee has exercised due diligence in attempting to resolve the issue. The judge has also found that the trustee has complied with all necessary procedures and has provided all required notices to potential claimants. Therefore, the judge has granted the petition and ordered the deposit of the surplus proceeds with the court.
