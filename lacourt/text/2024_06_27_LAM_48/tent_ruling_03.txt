[TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING DEMURRER
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
June 27, 2024



 
On
December 19, 2022, Plaintiff W.B. filed this action against Doe Defendants, arising
from childhood sexual assault.  The Complaint
alleges (1) negligent hiring, retention, and supervision; (2) negligent supervision
of a minor; (3) negligence; and (4) and failure to report suspected child abuse
in violation of Penal Code section 11164 based on vicarious liability.
On
October 12, 2023, Defendant Doe 2 filed a demurrer.
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.)  When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context, accepting the alleged facts as true.  (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.)
A.        The Complaint Is Not Time-Barred.
Defendant
first argues that this action is time-barred. 
However, as explained in the Opposition, the action is timely under California’s
2020 childhood sexual assault revival statute, codified at Code of Civil Procedure
section 340.1, subdivision (q).  Defendant
abandoned this argument in its Reply.
The
demurrer is overruled on this ground
B.        Plaintiff Does Not Allege Sufficient Facts
About Defendant’s Knowledge of the Abuse.
Defendant
also argues that the first, second, and third causes of action (based in negligence)
do not contain facts showing that Perpetrator’s conduct was foreseeable to Defendant.  (The third cause of action is actually not brought
against Defendant Doe 2.)
A
cause of action for negligence requires (1) a legal duty owed to the plaintiff to
use due care, (2) breach of that duty, (3) causation, and (4) damage to the plaintiff.  (County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield
Co. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 292, 318.) 
An employer may be liable to a third person for negligent hiring or retention
when the employer hired an employee who was incompetent or unfit, the employer had
reason to believe an undue risk of harm would exist because of the employment, and
harm occurred.  (Federico v. Superior Court
(1997) 59 Cal. App. 4th 1207, 1213-1214.) 
A claim for negligent supervision requires a showing of foreseeability of
a particular risk of harm.  (D.Z. v. Los
Angeles Unified School Dist. (2019) 35 Cal.App.5th 210, 235.)
The
Complaint alleges that Plaintiff was sexually assaulted by Perpetrator (an employee,
agent, servant, member, and/or volunteer of Defendants) for about seven years.  (Complaint ¶¶ 15, 27.)  The abuse occurred at Perpetrator’s trailer home
when Perpetrator used the position conferred upon him by Defendants as a mentor
to garner Plaintiff’s trust.  (Complaint ¶¶
27-28.)
Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant was “aware of the risk of sexual assault because, among other
things, Defendants had a prior history of abuse perpetrated by their Big Brothers.  For example, in August of 1977, Big Brother Donald
Rimbey [a member of Doe 2] was charged with six counts of molesting two nine-year-old
boys.”  (Complaint ¶ 32.)  This abuse was done by a different individual,
and it occurred several years before Perpetrator’s abuse of Plaintiff beginning
in 1983.  (See Complaint ¶ 27.)
Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant knew or was on notice about “Perpetrator’s dangerous and
sexual propensities towards minors in part because Perpetrator was openly physical
and affectionate with other male minors.” 
(Complaint ¶ 33.)  This does not specifically
state that Defendant was aware of actual abuse and does not show a foreseeability
of a particular risk of that harm.  Additionally,
“Defendants received reports and complaints of Perpetrator’s inappropriate behavior
and inappropriate meetings with minors prior to Perpetrator’s sexual assault of
Plaintiff.”  (Complaint ¶ 33.)  This too is conclusory and does not state specific
facts about Defendant’s knowledge.  (See also
Complaint ¶¶ 42-46, 60, 62, 70.)
In
opposition, Plaintiff relies on Defendant’s representations on its website that
Defendant is accountable for each child in its program and prioritizes safety.  (Opposition at pp. 6-7; see Complaint ¶¶ 9-12.)  This is not a substitute for Defendant’s knowledge
of and foreseeability of the risk of specific harm.
The
demurrer to the first and second causes of action is sustained.  (The third cause of action is not brought against
Defendant.)
Similarly,
the fourth cause of action for failure to report suspected child abuse alleges that
Defendant “had knowledge of or reasonably suspected that Plaintiff was a victim
of child abuse because it was objectively reasonable to suspect, based on Perpetrator’s
improper conduct, that Perpetrator was sexually abusing, sexually assaulting, and
exploiting Plaintiff.”  (Complaint ¶ 86.)  As with the first three causes of action, The
Complain lacks sufficient facts to show Defendant’s knowledge.
The
demurrer to the fourth cause of action is sustained.
C.        Conclusion
The
demurrer is SUSTAINED with 30 days’ leave to amend.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
