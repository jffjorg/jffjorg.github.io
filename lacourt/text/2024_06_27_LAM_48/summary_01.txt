And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling denying the motions to continue the trial and hearing on the motion for summary judgment (MSJ) filed by Cross-Defendants, which include Weber and Shane Josef Weber. The motions were denied because Cross-Defendants failed to show good cause for the continuances. The Court found that Cross-Defendants have not acted diligently and have not shown good cause for the continuances. The Court also found that Cross-Defendants' inability to obtain essential testimony is not excusable, and the reason that the testimony cannot be presented is due to Cross-Defendants' lack of diligence. The Court noted that the motions to continue were filed after almost three years of litigation, and that Cross-Defendants knew about some of the witnesses they are now seeking to depose for months or years before the PMK deposition. The Court also found that Cross-Defendants have not explained why certain depositions are essential or even necessary.
