Defendant’s
request for judicial notice is granted.
DISCUSSION
A
motion for judgment on the pleadings is the functional equivalent to a general demurrer.  (Lance Camper Mfg. Corp. v. Republic Indemnity
Co. of Am. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 194, 198.) 
Like demurrers, motions for judgment on the pleadings challenge the legal
sufficiency of the allegations, not their veracity.  (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  The Court “must
accept as true all material facts properly pleaded, but does not consider conclusions
of law or fact, opinions, speculation, or allegations contrary to law or facts that
are judicially noticed.”  (Stevenson Real
Estate Services, Inc. v. CB Richard Ellis Real Estate Services, Inc. (2006)
138 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1219-1220.)
A.        Plaintiffs Do Not Properly Allege Breach
of Contract.
The
standard elements of a claim for breach of contract are (1) the contract, (2) plaintiff’s
performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) damage
to plaintiff therefrom.  (Wall Street Network,
Ltd. v. New York Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178.)  “A written contract may be pleaded by its terms—set
out verbatim in the complaint or a copy of the contract attached to the complaint
and incorporated therein by reference—or by its legal effect.”  (McKell v. Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006)
142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1489.)  To plead a contract
by its legal effect, a plaintiff must “allege the substance of its relevant terms.  This is more difficult, for it requires a careful
analysis of the instrument, comprehensiveness in statement, and avoidance of legal
conclusions.”  (Ibid.)
The
FAC does not attach any contract.  Plaintiffs’
separately filed declaration and exhibits also do not include a contract
between Plaintiffs and Defendant.  Plaintiffs
allege that Defendant “caused damaging harm toward Plaintiff’s mental, physical,
and financial stability.  Plaintiff seeks
monetary award and return of title and possession of residence 8901 La Salle Ave,
Los Angeles, CA 90047 in this matter by rescinding Defendant’s Instrument No. 20190031645,
20190031646, 20190350161, 2021 1228470,20211714355, 20220614291, 20220885007.”  (FAC at p. 3.)  There are no factual allegations about any contract
between Plaintiffs and Defendant, nor any terms.
Additionally,
Defendant argues that any claim would be barred by the statute of limitations.  “‘In order for the bar of the statute of limitations
to be raised by demurrer, the defect must clearly and affirmatively appear on the
face of the complaint; it is not enough that the complaint shows that the action
may be barred.’”  (Geneva Towers Ltd. Partnership
v. City of San Francisco (2003) 29 Cal.4th 769, 781.)  An action based on a written contract must be
brought within four years.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 337.)  An action based on an oral contract
must be brought within two years.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 339.)  The FAC alleges that Defendant
breached the agreement on January 11, 2019—more than four years before Plaintiffs
filed this action on June 27, 2023.  (See
FAC at p. 3.)
To
the extent that Plaintiffs also allege breach of the implied covenant of good faith
and fair dealing (see FAC at p. 2), they cannot state a claim without an underlying
contract.  (See Guz v. Bechtel National,
Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 317, 349-350 [“The covenant of good faith and fair dealing,
implied by law in every contract, exists merely to prevent one contracting party
from unfairly frustrating the other party’s right to receive the benefits of the
agreement actually made.  . . . It cannot
impose substantive duties or limits on the contracting parties beyond those incorporated
in the specific terms of their agreement.”].)
Judgment
on the pleadings is granted for this cause of action.
B.        Plaintiffs Do Not Properly Allege Fraud.
Page
2, Item 9 of Plaintiff’s form complaint includes additional allegations:
“Pursuant to Penal Code 115, DFPI confirms Defendant’s Accounting Records
submitted on 10/11/23 of Creating A False Appearance of Default and
Foreclosure.”  There is no private right
of action under Penal Code section 115.  The
Court therefore construes this as a claim for fraud.
“The
essential elements of a count for intentional misrepresentation are (1) a misrepresentation,
(2) knowledge of falsity, (3) intent to induce reliance, (4) actual and justifiable
reliance, and (5) resulting damage.  [Citations.]  The essential elements of a count for negligent
misrepresentation are the same except that it does not require knowledge of falsity
but instead requires a misrepresentation of fact by a person who has no reasonable
grounds for believing it to be true.  [Citations.]”  (Chapman v. Skype Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th
217, 230-231.)  “Causes of action for intentional
and negligent misrepresentation sound in fraud and, therefore, each element must
be pleaded with specificity.”  (Daniels
v. Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1150, 1166.)  “‘This particularity requirement necessitates
pleading facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the
representations were tendered.’  [Citation.]”  (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th
631, 645.)
Fraud
based on concealment requires that “(1) the defendant must have concealed or suppressed
a material fact, (2) the defendant must have been under a duty to disclose the fact
to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed
the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been
unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed
or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the
fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage.”  (Bigler-Engler v. Breg, Inc. (2017) 7 Cal.App.5th
276, 310-311.)  Less specificity is required
to plead fraud by concealment.  (Ibid.)  “Even under the strict rules of common law pleading,
one of the canons was that less particularity is required when the facts lie more
in the knowledge of the opposite party.” 
(Alfaro v. Community Housing Improvement System & Planning Assn.,
Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1384.)
The
FAC alleges that Plaintiffs’ mortgage payments were not applied to Loan No. 0596808564,
“causing a fraudulent Notice of Default of foreclosure on 01-11-2019.”  (FAC at p. 3, ¶ BC-2.)  This allegation is uncertain, lacks any specificity,
and does not meet the particularity requirement for pleading a fraud claim.
Judgment
on the pleadings is granted for this cause of action.
CONCLUSION
The
motion for judgment on the pleadings is GRANTED.  Plaintiffs did not meaningfully amend the
original complaint and have not shown any way they can plausibly remedy the FAC’s
deficiencies, so no leave to amend is granted.
Defendant
is ordered to submit a proposed form of judgment within five days.
A
Non-Appearance Case Review re: Submission of Proposed Judgment is scheduled for
July 10, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
