[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTION TO CONTINUE
  HEARING ON MSJ; DENYING MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
June 27, 2024



 
On
May 13, 2021, Weber Enterprise Trucking Corporation (“Weber”) filed this action
against Forest Lawn Memorial-Park Association (“Forest Lawn”) and others.
On
October 21, 2022, Forest Lawn filed a first amended cross-complaint (“FACC”) against
Weber and Shane Josef Weber (collectively, “Cross-Defendants”).
On October 26, 2022, Weber filed
a first amended complaint (“FAC”).
On
April 26, 2024, Forest Lawn filed a second motion for summary judgment/adjudication.
On
May 21, 2024, Cross-Defendants filed a motion to continue trial and all related
dates.  On June 3, 2024, Cross-Defendants
filed a motion to continue the hearing on Forest Lawn’s MSJ.  In both motions, Cross-Defendants argue that they
need to conduct more discovery in order to oppose Forest Lawn’s MSJ.
A
court may grant a continuance of trial upon a showing of good cause.  (California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c).)  Good cause includes a party’s excused inability
to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent
efforts.  (California Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(c)(3), (c)(6).)  The court
must consider all the facts and circumstances that are relevant to the determination.  (California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).)
If
affidavits submitted in opposition to a motion for summary judgment show that facts
essential to justify opposition may exist but cannot be presented, the Court shall
deny the motion or order a continuance to permit additional discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (h).)
Cross-Defendants
first served a notice of deposition of Forest Lawn’s person most knowledgeable (“PMK”)
on February 26, 2024.  (Laes Trial Opp. Decl.
¶ 6; Laes MSJ Opp. Decl. ¶ 6.)  The first
volume of the PMK deposition occurred on April 12, 2024.  (Tabrizi Trial Decl. ¶ 5; Tabrizi MSJ Decl. ¶
6.)  The parties did not agree on a date for
the second volume.  (Tabrizi Trial Decl. ¶¶
7-8; Tabrizi MSJ Decl. ¶¶ 7-8.)  Cross-Defendants
later noticed the second volume for June 24, 2024, when the PMK was unavailable.  (Laes Trial Opp. Decl. ¶ 7; Laes MSJ Opp. Decl.
¶ 7.)
During
the first volume, Forest Lawn’s PMK provided information regarding additional third-party
and employee witnesses that will need to be deposed, including Visser Grading, Fernandez
Trucking LLC, Partner Engineering and Science Inc., Hahn & Associates Inc. (“Hahn”),
Gail Materials, First Stop Recycling, Anthony Rubio, William Hahn, Brian Emerson,
and Suzanne Davidson.  (Tabrizi Trial Decl.
¶ 9; Tabrizi MSJ Decl. ¶ 9.)
Cross-Defendants
have not acted diligently and have not shown good cause for a continuance of the
MSJ or trial.  Cross-Defendants did not notice
a deposition of Forest Lawn’s until almost three years after they filed this action.  Even then, the additional third-party and employee
witnesses were not newly discovered.  Forest
Lawn has shown that Cross-Defendants knew about these witnesses for months, if not
years, before the PMK deposition.
Visser
Grading and Anthony Rubio were identified and included in Forest Lawn’s May 2022
responses to Cross-Defendants’ first set of special interrogatories.  (Laes Trial Opp. Decl., Ex. 1 [Responses to Special
Interrogatories Nos. 77, 78, 79, 80, 115, 116].)  Shane Weber also repeatedly testified about Visser
Grading and its involvement in the events at issue during his deposition on July
29, 2022.  (Laes Trial Opp. Decl., Ex. 14.)  Cross-Defendants served special interrogatories
and document requests specifically related to Visser Grading in August 2023.  (Laes Trial Opp. Decl., Exs. 3-4.)  Cross-Defendants served a document subpoena directed
to Visser Grading in February 2024 and March 2024, and they served a deposition
subpoena on May 21, 2024, for a June 19, 2024 deposition.  (Laes Trial Opp. Decl., Exs. 5-7.)
Forest
Lawn identified Anthony Rubio as a witness in its responses to Cross-Defendants’
Special Interrogatories, Set One.  (Laes Trial
Opp. Decl. ¶ 9.)  Cross-Defendants served
a notice of deposition of “Anthony Robles” on January 23, 2023, and Forest Lawn
objected in part due to the misidentification. 
(Laes Trial Opp. Decl. ¶ 9.)  Since
Forest Lawn’s objection, Cross-Defendants have never again sought to depose Anthony
Rubio.  (Laes Trial Opp. Decl. ¶ 9.)
Cross-Defendants
themselves identified Fernandez Trucking as a potential witness in January 2022
in its responses to Forest Lawn’s first set of interrogatories, and Forest Lawn
also identified it in responses to Cross-Defendants’ second set of special interrogatories
in October 2023.  (Laes Trial Opp. Decl.,
Ex. 8 [Response to Form Interrogatory No. 17.1], Ex. 9 [Responses to Special Interrogatories
Nos. 131, 132, 134, 137, 138, 148, 149, 159, 177].)  Cross-Defendants served a document subpoena directed
to Fernandez Trucking in February 2024 and noticed Fernandez Trucking’s deposition
for June 20, 2024, before the discovery cutoff. 
(Laes Trial Opp. Decl., Exs. 15-16.)
Partner
Engineering and Science Inc. is Forest Lawn’s retained consultant and expert, and
expert disclosures are not yet due.  (Trial
Opposition at p. 6; MSJ Opposition at p. 11.)
Hahn
was identified and its survey was one of the main issues in Forest Lawn’s first
motion for summary judgment, which was initially filed in November 2022 and heard
in July 2023.  (Trial Opposition at p. 6;
MSJ Opposition at p. 11; Laes Trial Opp. Decl. ¶ 25.)  Hahn was also identified as having knowledge of
relevant facts in Forest Lawn’s first set of discovery responses in May 2022.  (Laes Trial Opp. Decl., Ex. 1 [Responses to Special
Interrogatories Nos. 2, 5, 8].)
Gail
Materials was the subject of document requests served by Cross-Defendants themselves
in February 2023, and Forest Lawn produced documents related to Gail Materials.  (Trial Opposition at p. 6; MSJ Opposition at p.
11; Laes Trial Opp. Decl., Ex. 12.)
First
Stop Recycling was identified in Forest Lawn’s responses to Cross-Defendants’ second
set of special interrogatories in October 2023. 
(Laes Trial Opp. Decl., Ex. 9 [Responses to Special Interrogatories Nos.
168, 172].)  Cross-Defendants also served
business records subpoenas to First Stop Recycling in February 2024 and March 2024.  (Laes Trial Opp. Decl., Exs. 10-11.)
William
Hahn, Brian Emerson, and Suzanne Davidson are employees of Forest Lawn, but Cross-Defendants
do not explain why these depositions are essential or even necessary.  (See Trial Opposition at p. 7; MSJ Opposition
at pp. 12-13.)
Cross-Defendants
argue that “[i]t was not until Forest Lawn’s PMK deposition was taken that the true
extent of the witnesses’ involvement in the Soil Agreement became known,” and “identifying
witnesses does not reveal information as to how relevant the witnesses are to Weber’s
defense or Weber’s claims.”  (Trial Reply
at p. 2; MSJ Reply at p. 4.)  In their Replies,
Cross-Defendants attempt to explain the necessity of the additional depositions,
but this information was not included in the initial motions.
Cross-Defendants’
inability to obtain essential testimony is not excusable, and the reason that the
testimony cannot be presented is due to Cross-Defendants’ lack of diligence.  (See California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c);
Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (h).)  Cross-Defendants
have not shown good cause for any continuances.
The
motions are DENIED without prejudice to the request for a continuance being renewed
in opposition to the MSJ under Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision
(h).
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
