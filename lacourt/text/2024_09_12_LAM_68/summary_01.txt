Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted a motion to be relieved as counsel of record filed by counsel for Defendant Hispania Petroleum, S.A. The motion was filed due to "irreconcilable differences" and "unreasonable difficulty" in representing the client. The court finds that the motion complies with all procedural requirements and is therefore granted. The order will not be effective until served on the client, and the corporate entities cannot appear in the action without representation from an admitted attorney. The court notes that four additional motions to be relieved as counsel for additional defendants are scheduled from September 11 to September 30, 2024.
