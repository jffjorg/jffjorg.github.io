And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel binding arbitration. The defendant moves to compel arbitration under the Retail Installment Sale Contract (RISC) between the parties. The plaintiff does not oppose the motion. The judge finds that the FAA applies to the RISC and that the defendant has established the existence of a valid agreement to arbitrate. The judge grants the motion and compels arbitration under the RISC, staying the action pending the completion of arbitration.
