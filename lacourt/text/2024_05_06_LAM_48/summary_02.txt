And here is the English-text summary:

The Court's tentative ruling is that the demurrer to the entire First Amended Complaint is sustained without leave to amend. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's allegations are uncertain and do not state a cause of action. The Plaintiff's allegations are unclear and do not provide a legal basis to support his claims of civil rights violations. The Court also grants the Motion to Strike the incorrectly filed Amended Civil Case Cover Sheet Addendum for the related Case 23STCP01900.
