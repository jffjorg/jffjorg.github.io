And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's request for a default judgment. Instead, the court has set a hearing to determine why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or the plaintiff's counsel should be sanctioned $250 for failing to enter the default judgment. The reason for this decision is that the request for court judgment does not properly seek an amount that is equal to or less than the amount sought in the complaint or the C.C.P. §425.11 statement of damages. The complaint does not specify the amount demanded, and the C.C.P. §425.11 statement of damages was not properly prepared. The court will hear this matter on March 12, 2025, at 8:30 AM in Department 71 at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
