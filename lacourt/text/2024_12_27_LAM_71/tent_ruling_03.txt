         vs.
 
EMMANUEL
  J. DELACRUZ.


 Case No.: 
  23STCV10214
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 27, 2024



 
The Court
denies Plaintiff’s default judgment packet. 

The Court sets a hearing on an order to show cause why the complaint
should not be dismissed and/or Plaintiff’s counsel sanctioned $250 for failing
to enter default judgment (California Rule of Court, rule 3.110(h)) on March 12,
2025, at 8:30 AM in Department 71 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse for the following
reasons:

The
     request for court judgment does not properly seek an amount that is equal
     to or less than the amount sought in the complaint or C.C.P. §425.11
     statement of damages.  (See, e.g.,
     Falahati v. Kondo (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 823, 830-831
     [stating court acts in excess of its jurisdiction and the resulting
     default judgment is void if the court awards default judgment in an amount
     greater than that demanded in the complaint, including if the complaint
     does not specify the amount demanded].)  The Prayer of the complaint
     does not specify the amount demanded.
