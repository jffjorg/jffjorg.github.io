Plaintiff
PSG California, LLC’s motion for an order discharging it from all liability to
Defendants and Cross-Complainant Eric Mintz; Euro Spec Motoring, Inc.; and the Law
Offices of David R. Denis, P.C., and dismissing Plaintiff from the above action
is

Plaintiff PSG California, LLC (“PSG”) (“Plaintiff”)
moves for an order discharging it from all liability to Defendants and
Cross-Complainant Eric Mintz (“Mintz”); Euro Spec Motoring, Inc. (“Euro Spec”);
and the Law Offices of David R. Denis, P.C. (“LODD”) (collectively,
“Defendants”), and dismissing Plaintiff from the above action.  (Notice Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P. §386.5.)  Plaintiff has deposited with the clerk the
sum of $ 21,243.54 which consists of the settlement amount to which each of the
Defendants have made claims.  (Notice
Motion, pg. 2.)  Plaintiff further moves
under C.C.P. §386.6 for an award of costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees
incurred in bringing this interpleader action and this Motion in the sum of
$7,102.00.  (Notice Motion, pg. 2.)
 
Request for Judicial Notice
Euro Spec’s 12/13/24 request for judicial
notice of Plaintiff’s Complaint in Interpleader is denied because this Court
does not need to take judicial notice of filings on the instant docket.
Euro Spec’s 12/13/24 request for judicial
notice of (1) the docket for Angel Lujan v. Dover Pump Solutions Group et
al., LASC Case No. 20STCV09522 (E-RJN, Exh. 2); (2) Notice of the May 17,
2023, Order Granting Motion for Assignment and Restraining Order in Eric
Mintz v. Law Offices of David R. Denis, P.C. et al., LASC Case No. BC704715
(E-RJN, Exh. 3); and (3) Excerpts of the October 30, 2024, appellate decision
reversing the restraining order portion of this Court’s May 17, 2023, Order in Mintz
v. Law Offices of David R. Denis, P.C. et al. (E-RJN, Exh. 4), is granted.
 
Background
Plaintiff filed its complaint in interpleader
on November 8, 2023, against Defendants. 
Mintz filed his cross-complaint against Plaintiff on December 14, 2023.  On or about December 14, 2023, Plaintiff
deposited the sum of $21,243.54 (“Funds”), being the entire amount in dispute,
with the clerk of this Court on the filing of this Complaint.  (Decl. of Poei ¶12, Exh. 7.)
Plaintiff filed the instant motion on October
8, 2024.  Mintz, Euro Spec, and LODD all
filed their separate oppositions on December 13, 2024.  As of the date of this hearing no reply has
been filed.
 
Legal Standard
Interpleader is proper whenever “double or
multiple claims are made . . . by two or more persons . . . such that they may
[expose the person against whom the claims are asserted] to double or multiple
liability.”  (C.C.P. §386(b).)
Interpleader
is proper even though the conflicting claims are not identical or mutually
exclusive. A partial conflict is sufficient (e.g., Bank holding $10,000, of
which A claims the entire amount, and B claims only $2,000).  (C.C.P. §386(b); City of Morgan Hill v.
Brown (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1114, 1123.)
A
two-step procedure is generally followed: (1) the court must first determine
whether plaintiff may bring the suit and force the claimants to interplead; and
(2) if it is so determined, the court will discharge plaintiff from liability
and then determine the rights of the various claimants to the property that has
been deposited with the court.  (City
of Morgan Hill, 71 Cal.App.4th at pgs. 1126-1127.)
Any
amount which the plaintiff-stakeholder admits owing may be deposited with the
court clerk. Such deposit has the effect of terminating any obligation for
interest, or for damages for detention of property, after the date of the
deposit.  (C.C.P. §386(c).)  Upon application of a party to the action,
funds so deposited will be ordered invested in an insured, interest-bearing
account.  (C.C.P. §386.1.)
If the
defendant-stakeholder claims no interest in the funds or property held, he or
she need not file an interpleader cross-complaint. He or she may simply apply
to the court for permission to deposit the money or property with the court
clerk, and for an order discharging him or her from further liability to the
adverse claimants. Such order will also substitute the adverse claimants as
parties to the action; or, if only money is involved, simply dismiss the
stakeholder.  (C.C.P. §§386(a), 386.5.)  The motion must be supported by an affidavit
by the stakeholder establishing the ground for interpleader.  (C.C.P. §§ 386(a), 386.5.)
The
adverse claimants cannot prevent the stakeholder from being discharged by
claiming the funds should have been paid to them. To pursue such claims, they
must file an independent action against the stakeholder.  (Pacific Loan Management Corp. v. Superior
Court (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1485, 1489.)
 
Discussion
Plaintiff’s action for interpleader is proper
because multiple claims are asserted with respect to the same policy
proceedings.
Here, Mintz, Euro Spec, and LODD all assert
entitlement to the Funds. Because these conflicting demands for the same monies
to be paid pursuant to the Lujan Settlement, Plaintiff has the right to
interplead the disputed funds, and it did interplead the disputed funds on or
about November 8, 2023, when it filed its Complaint.  On or about December 14, 2023, Plaintiff
deposited the sum in dispute ($21,243.64) with the Court. Because the amount
due and owing was properly interpleaded, Plaintiff is entitled to an order
dismissing it from the action and discharging it from all liability with
respect to that amount and to each of the Defendants and Cross-Complainant.  (City
of Morgan Hill, 71 Cal.App.4th at pgs. 1126-1127.)
Accordingly, Plaintiff is dismissed from this
action and discharged from all liability with respect to the $21,243.64
deposited with this Court and to each of the Defendants and Cross-Complainant.
 
Attorneys’ Fees and Costs
C.C.P. §386.6(a), which allows a discharged
party to recover its costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in an
interpleader action.  (C.C.P. §386.6(a).)  “In ordering the discharge of such party, the
court may, in its discretion, award such party his costs and reasonable
attorney fees from the amount in dispute which has been deposited with the
court. At the time of final judgment in the action the court may make such
further provision for assumption of such costs and attorney fees by one or more
of the adverse claimants as may appear proper.” 
(Id.)
Plaintiff requests costs and fees in this
action be reimbursed in the amount of $7,102.00.  (Motion, pg. 6; Decl. of Poei ¶13.)  Plaintiff requests the following hours billed
by its counsel: (1) Yvonne Arvanitis Fossati: 12.9 hours x $275/hour =
$3,547.50; (2) James Carter: 1.6 hours x $275/hour = $440.00; (3) Hazel U.
Poei: 5.0 hours x $275/hour = $1,375.00; and (4) Rochelle Miller: 7.1 hours x
$245/hour = $1,739.50.  (Decl. of Poei
¶13.)
Plaintiff’s request for costs and fees is
granted in the total amount of $7,102.00.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion for an order discharging it
from all liability to Defendants and Cross-Complainant, and dismissing
Plaintiff from the above action is granted.
Plaintiff’s request for fees and costs is
granted in the total amount of $7,102.00. 
The fees shall be paid from the interpleaded funds.    
Moving Party to give notice.
