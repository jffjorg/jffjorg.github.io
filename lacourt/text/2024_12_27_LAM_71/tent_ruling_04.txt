Background
On October 3, 2023, Fourteenth
Street (“Plaintiff”) filed its operative Complaint against Defendants Yesenia
Estrada, Cuahtemoe Paz, Lending Choices Investments, and Netco Title Company
for cancellation of instrument and declaratory relief.  On November 8, 2024, Plaintiff stipulated to
dismiss Cuahtemoe Paz.  On March 8, 2024,
Plaintiff stipulated to dismiss Yesenia Estrada.  On November 13, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed
Netco Title Company.
On November 16, 2023, the
clerk entered default against Lending Choices Investments.  On December 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
Request for Court Judgment to be heard on December 27, 2024.
 
Party’s Request
Plaintiff requests the Court to enter a
default judgment against Defendant and award Plaintiff the following judgment:
(1) cancelling and voiding the Deed of Trust by Defendant Lending Choices
Investments encumbering the Property that was recorded on April 30, 2021, as
Document No. 20210692228 (“Lending Choices Deed of Trust”) in the Official
Records of the Los Angeles Recorders Office, rendering it of no further force
of effect; (2) cancelling and expunging the Lending Choices Deed of Trust from
the Official Records of the Los Angeles Recorder’s Office; (3) entitling Plaintiff
to record this Judgment in the Official Records of the Los Angeles County
Recorder’s Office as reconveyances of the Lending Choices Deed of Trust; and
(4) upon presentation of a certified electronic copy of this Judgment and
payment of any fees required by law, ordering the Recorder of Los Angeles
County to accept the Judgment for recording and to record it within the
Official Records of the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office.
 
Discussion

completed default judgment packet, with all applicable attachments. The Court
finds sufficient evidence to justify the requested award and grants Plaintiff Fourteenth
Street LLC’s request in full.

judgment filed on December 10, 2024, is granted.  Judgment is entered against Defendant Lending
Choices.
