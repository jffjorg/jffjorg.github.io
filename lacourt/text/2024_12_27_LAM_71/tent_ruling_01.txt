ALEJANDRA
  PADILLA,  
  
         vs.
 
FEAST
  FOODS, LLC.


 Case No.: 
  23STCV03705
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 27, 2024



 
Defendant
Feast Foods, LLC’s unopposed motion for relief
from waiver for failure to serve timely responses to Plaintiff Alejandra
Padilla’s Requests for Interrogatories (Set One), Request for Admissions (Set
One), and Request for Production of Documents (Set One) is granted.
 
Defendant Feast Foods, LLC (“Feast Foods”)
(“Defendant”) moves unopposed for relief from waiver for failure to
serve timely responses to Plaintiff Alejandra Padilla’s (“Padilla”)
(“Plaintiff”) Request for Interrogatories (Set One) (“ROG”), Request for
Admissions (Set One) (“RFA”), and Request for Production of Documents (Set One)
(“RFP”).  (Notice Motion, pgs. 1-2;
C.C.P. §§2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a).)  Defendant moves on the grounds that it failed
to serve timely responses due to inadvertence and excusable neglect and has
subsequently served compliant responses. 
(Notice Motion, pg. 2.)
 
Background
On August 9, 2024, Plaintiff, through her
counsel, served Defendant with Form ROG, Employment ROG, Special ROG, RFA, and RFP.  (Decl. of Ramirez ¶4.)  Responses were due Wednesday, September 11,
2024, with a two-court day addition for electronic service of the requests.  (Decl. of Ramirez ¶4.)  On September 10, 2024, Defendant’s counsel
sent a meet and confer letter regarding a Motion for Protective Order under
C.C.P. §§2030.090, 2031.060, 2022.080, and 2016.040.  (Decl. of Ramirez ¶5, Exh. A.)
Plaintiff’s counsel responded that day, denying
that a protective order was warranted and offering to extend the deadline for
responses.  (Decl. of Ramirez ¶6, Exh.
B.)  Defendant accepted an extension to
Friday, September 13, 2024. (Decl. of Ramirez ¶7, Exh. C.)
On September 13, 2024, at 4:47 p.m.,
Defendant’s counsel reached out to Plaintiff’s counsel via email to request a
brief extension to Tuesday September 17, 2024. 
(Decl. of Ramirez ¶9, Exh. D.) 
Counsel for Plaintiff did not respond until September 17, 2024,
demanding discovery responses without objections by the same date.  (Decl. of Ramirez ¶10, Exh. E.)  Defendant served responses on Tuesday,
September 17, 2024, at 10:11 a.m.  (Decl.
of Ramirez ¶11, Exh. F.)
Defendant filed the instant motion on September
30, 2024.  As of the date of this hearing
no opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
C.C.P §§2030.290 (Interrogatories); §2031.300
(Inspection demands); and §2033.280 (Requests for admission) all contain the
legal standard for relief from belated discovery responses.  Each section provides, in part:
[T]he
court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination
that both the following conditions are satisfied:
 
(1)   The
party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with
[the applicable discovery code sections]
(2)   The
party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
 
(See C.C.P §§2030.290(a), 2031.300(a),
2033.280(a).)
In determining what constitutes “mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect” under the Discovery Act, courts apply the
same or similar standards as for relief from default under C.C.P. § 473(b).  (City of Fresno v. Superior Court
(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1459, 1467.)  Generally,
the standard of what constitutes “mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect,”
is fact dependent.  (See City of
Fresno, 205 Cal.App.3d at pgs. 1466-1467.)
“The ‘excusable neglect’ referred to in the
section is that neglect which might have been the act of a reasonably prudent
person under the same circumstances. [Citation.]”  (Baratti v. Baratti (1952) 109
Cal.App.2d 917, 921.)  In deciding
whether counsel’s error is excusable, courts look to “(1) the nature of the
mistake or neglect[] and (2) whether counsel was otherwise diligent in
investigating and pursuing the claim.” (Tackett v. City of Huntington Beach
(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 60, 65, citing Bettencourt v. Los Rios Community
College District (1986) 42 Cal.3d 270, 276.)  In determining whether the attorney’s mistake
or inadvertence was excusable, “the court inquires whether ‘a reasonably
prudent person under the same or similar circumstances’ might have made the
same error.” (Bettencourt, 42 Cal.3d at pg. 276.)
 
Discussion
Defendant’s motion is granted.  Defendant served Plaintiff with complete and
verified responses as required by the code, on September 17, 2024.  (Decl. of Ramirez ¶11, Exh. F.)  Further, Defendant’s failure to serve a
timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect.  Here, on September 13, 2024,
Defendant’s counsel received last minute feedback from several internal
employees, which resulted in the production of more documents and information,
which needed to be added to the responses. 
(Decl. of Ramirez ¶8.) 
Defendant’s counsel’s failure to timely circulate the responses among
several of Defendant’s employees far enough in advance of the deadline to get
approval of the revised final responses constitutes excusable neglect because a
reasonably prudent person under the same or similar circumstances might have
made the same error.  (See Bettencourt,
42 Cal.3d at pg. 276.)
          Accordingly, Defendant’s motion is
granted.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s unopposed motion for relief
from waiver for failure to serve timely responses to Plaintiff’s Form ROG,
Employment ROG, Special ROG, RFA, and RFP is granted.
Moving Party to give notice.
