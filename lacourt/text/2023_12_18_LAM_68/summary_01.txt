And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to tax costs filed by the Plaintiffs, Sandra D. Smith-Martin and Sterling K. Martin. The motion was based on the Defendant, State Farm General Insurance Company's, failure to include supporting documentation with its Memorandum of Costs. The Defendant claimed $20,504.77 in costs, but did not provide a worksheet or any other documentation to support its claim. The Plaintiffs argued that the Defendant must provide supporting documentation to justify its claimed costs, citing cases such as Jones v. Dumrichob and Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp. The Defendant later provided the required documentation, making the Plaintiffs' motion to tax costs moot. The Judge has denied the motion to tax costs without prejudice, giving the Plaintiffs 15 days to refile their motion based on the new information.
