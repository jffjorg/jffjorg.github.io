  Case Number:  21STCV11434    Hearing Date:   December 18, 2023    Dept:  68 Sandra D. Smith-Martin, et al. vs. State Farm General
Insurance Company, 21STCV11434
Motion to Tax Costs
Moving Parties: Plaintiffs Sandra D. Smith-Martin and
Sterling K. Martin

Responding Party: Defendant
State Farm General Insurance Company

Motion
            This Court
granted Defendant State Farm General Insurance Company’s (Defendant) motion for
summary judgment on August 31, 2023, with judgment entered on October 18, 2023.
On November 2, 2023, Defendant filed its Memorandum of Costs, seeking
$20,504.77 in costs. Defendant did not include a memorandum of costs worksheet
with this filing, or any other documentation for its claimed costs. 
“Although there is no requirement
that copies of bills, invoices, statements be attached to the memorandum, once
the memorandum of costs has been challenged put at issue, the party seeking the
costs must submit supporting documentation. Jones v. Dumrichob 63 Cal.App.4th
1258, 1267 (1998).”  (Motion P&A pg.
4:23-26.)
Plaintiffs Sandra D. Smith-Martin
and Sterling K. Martin (Plaintiffs) have filed a motion to tax costs based on
Defendant’s failure to include the worksheet and challenging Defendant’s
claimed costs due to the lack of documentation supporting the claimed costs. Plaintiffs
filed this motion pursuant to Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp.
(2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 44 (allowing for reasonable costs) and Jones v.
Dumrichob 63 Cal.App.4th 1258 (requiring a party to submit supporting
documentation when the memorandum of costs has been challenged). 
            Defendant’s
opposition included a declaration from Defendant’s attorney, Marlene K. Flores.
Attached to the declaration are the memorandum of costs worksheet and documentation
supporting the claimed costs.
            Because
Plaintiffs’ motion to tax costs was based on the lack of supporting documents
for Defendant’s claimed costs, Plaintiffs’ motion is now moot. The Court denies
Plaintiffs’ motion.
Order
1.      Plaintiffs’
motion to tax costs is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
2.      Plaintiffs
are given 15 days to refile a motion to tax costs based on the documents
provided by Defendant.
