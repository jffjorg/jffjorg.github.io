POST-JUDGMENT LITIGATION EXPENSES & INTEREST
 
Motion filed on 2/27/24.
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Canyon View Limited
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Nationstar Mortgage, LLC
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order requiring Defendant
Nationstar Mortgage, LLC to pay Plaintiff Canyon View Limited the attorneys’
fees and costs incurred on appeal and interest on the Judgment entered by this
Court on 2/21/19.
 
RULING: The hearing on this motion will be continued.  
 
On 2/21/19, this Court entered Judgment in favor of
Plaintiff Canyon View Limited (Plaintiff) and against Defendant Nationstar
Mortgage, LLC (Nationstar) and other defendants to quiet title under the
Mobilehome Park Residency Law (MRL).
 
On 3/24/21, this Court awarded Plaintiff $494,548.09 in
prejudgment litigation expenses as the prevailing party under the MRL.  On 10/26/23, the Court of Appeal affirmed
this Court’s 3/24/24 order.
 
On 2/27/24, Plaintiff filed and served the instant motion
seeking an order requiring Nationstar to pay Plaintiff the attorneys’ fees and
costs incurred on appeal in the amount of $158,624.63 and interest on the
Judgment from 2/21/19 to the date the Judgment is paid at the daily rate of
$135.49.
 
On 9/13/24, Nationstar filed and served a late opposition
to the motion wherein it claims that it has settled this case and a “companion
case” (PC057199) with Plaintiff. 
Nationstar contends that on 9/9/24, Plaintiff sent its final changes to
the draft settlement agreement which Nationstar accepted and began making
efforts to obtain signatures.  Nationstar
contends that on 9/13/24, Plaintiff requested minor additional changes which
Nationstar is reviewing.  Based on the
foregoing, Nationstar requests a continuance of the hearing on this motion for
at least 30 days to allow for finalization of the settlement and the
implementation of its terms.
 
On 9/13/24, Plaintiff filed and served a reply to the
opposition which notes the untimeliness of the opposition and objects to a
continuance of the hearing on this motion.
 
Plaintiff does not dispute that the parties are in the
midst of finalizing a settlement or the timeline regarding same presented by
Nationstar in the opposition.  Based on
such and the fact that such settlement negotiations likely account for the lack
of an opposition on the merits being timely filed by Nationstar, the Court
finds that it is in the interests of justice and judicial economy to continue
the hearing on the motion.  If the matter
does not ultimately settle, a supplemental opposition on the merits will be due
at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date and any reply to the
supplemental opposition will be due at least 5 court days before the continued
hearing  date.  
 
At least 3 court days before the continued hearing date,
the parties are ordered to notify the Court whether the settlement has been
formalized and whether or not the hearing on the motion will proceed on the
merits.
