And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the plaintiff's motion for default judgment against the defendant, Christan Blaha. The plaintiff, Marjan Svetko, alleges that Blaha breached a promissory note executed on August 27, 2019, in the amount of $50,000 with an interest rate of 8%. The complaint was filed on July 6, 2022, and the defendant filed an answer on October 19, 2022. Following a hearing on a motion for terminating sanctions, the court struck the defendant's answer and entered default. The plaintiff now seeks default judgment in the amount of $86,866.23, including $4,340.14 in interest, $1,766.09 in costs, and $30,760.00 in attorney fees. The court finds that the plaintiff has submitted sufficient evidence to support the breach of the promissory note and the resulting damages. However, the court reduces the requested attorney fees from $30,760.00 to $3,270.00, deeming them unreasonable. The court grants entry of default judgment in the amount of $59,376.23, subject to the plaintiff's compliance with California Rule of Court, rule 3.1806.
