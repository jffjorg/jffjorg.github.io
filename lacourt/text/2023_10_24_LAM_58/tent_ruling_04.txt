            This
action arises from a breach of a promissory note. Plaintiff Marjan Svetko (Plaintiff)
sued Defendant Christan Blaha asserting a single cause of action for breach of
promissory note. Plaintiff alleges Defendant executed a promissory note on
August 27, 2019 in the amount of $50,000 at an interest rate of 8%.[1]
            
            The
Complaint was filed on July 6, 2022. On October 19, 2022, Defendant filed an
answer. On August 3, 2023, following a hearing on a motion for terminating
sanctions, the Court struck Defendant’s answer and entered default. 
 
            Plaintiff
now moves for default judgment against Defendant. Does 1-5 have been dismissed.
The request for entry of default judgment is granted conditionally. 
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff
seeks default judgment in the amount of $86,866.23, which includes $4,340.14 in
interest, $1,766.09 in costs, and $30,760.00 in attorney fees. 
 
             Plaintiff submits sufficient evidence to
support the breach of the $50,000 promissory note and the resulting damages.
(Svetko Decl., ¶¶ 2-4.) Further, Plaintiff properly calculates pre-judgment
interest in the amount of $4,340.14, accruing at 8% from the date of May 31,
2022 – the date Plaintiff’s attorney made a written demand to Defendant – until
June 30, 2023, the date of the Request for Entry of Default Judgment against Defendant
Blaha. Lastly, Plaintiff substantiates the request for reasonable costs in the
amount of $1,766.09, which includes $516.45 in clerk's filing fees, $249.64 for
process server's fees and $1,000.00 in unpaid sanctions. (Pierce Decl., ¶ 7.)[2]
 
Previously, the
Court found Plaintiff’s request for default judgment was deficient because Plaintiff
requested $30,760 in attorney’s fees but did not provide adequate justification
for these fees. On this second attempt, Plaintiff’s counsel now submits his billing
records to justify his request for fees. 
 
However, in
reviewing the billing records, the Court finds the requested fees here are
unreasonable. As a preliminary matter, the Los Angeles County court rules
provide – in contested cases – that $3,270 is a reasonable amount given the
damages at issue. (LA County Court Rules, rule 3.214.) There is no reason to
deviate from this amount under the circumstances here. The contested issues in
this litigation consisted only of standard motions to compel initial responses and
a motion for terminating sanctions. Based on the limited adversarial litigation
and the extremely simple claim raised (a breach of a promissory note), the
request for approximately $30,000 is exorbitant.  Further, there was an excessive amount of client
communications billed, seemingly unnecessary legal research on the issues
raised in this case, and extensive billing for administrative tasks (billed at
attorney rates). 
 
Thus, entry of
default judgment is granted in the amount of $59,376.23.

The Court conditions
entry of judgment on Plaintiff’s compliance with California Rule of Court, rule
3.1806, which states: “In all cases in which judgment is rendered upon a written obligation to

ordered, note over the clerk's official signature and across the face of the
