And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendants Western Fertility Institute LLC and Ashim Kumar. The court has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the first and second causes of action as to Defendant Kumar only. The court has overruled the demurrer as to the third and fourth causes of action. The court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend as to the fifth cause of action.

The court has also granted the motion to strike the request for punitive damages. The court has ordered the amended complaint to be served and filed on or before November 27, 2023.

The case involves a dispute between Plaintiffs Olga Shnayder and Mehmet Dogru and Defendants Western Fertility Institute LLC and Ashim Kumar over a contract for in vitro fertilization and surrogacy services. The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants breached the contract and caused them to incur additional medical costs. The Defendants demurred to the complaint, arguing that the allegations were insufficient to state a claim.

The court has reviewed the allegations and has found that the Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for breach of contract and money had and received. However, the court has found that the Plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for breach of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing or intentional infliction of emotional distress. The court has also found that the request for punitive damages is not supported by the allegations and has granted the motion to strike.
