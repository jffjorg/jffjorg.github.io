[1]           The Complaint purports to attach this
promissory note as Exhibit A. But Exhibit A is a promissory note in the amount
of $14,000, dated November 3, 2007 and not in Defendant’s name.
 


[2]           This evidence was
submitted in the prior default judgment package but not submitted again in the
new default judgment package. As a note to counsel, all evidence that a party
intends the Court to rely on should be submitted in full each time for the Court’s
review so that the Court is not required to search through past default
judgment packages to locate the necessary documents. The Court will overlook this
oversight on this occasion.
