 Case Number:  21STCV19527    Hearing Date:   May 22, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
May 24, 2021, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Gerardo Prado,
Reliable Environmental Services, Inc. (“Reliable”), and Does 1-10 for
subrogation. The complaint demanded damages
of $43,296.79, interest at the rate of 10% per annum from June 10, 2020, and
costs of suit. 
On
July 29, 2021, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement. 
On
November 29, 2021, based on a stipulation between Plaintiff and Reliable, the
Court dismissed the case without prejudice and retained jurisdiction under Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6 to enforce the terms of the settlement. The
stipulation stated that if Reliable defaulted on the terms of the settlement, “judgment
may be entered forthwith in favor of [Plaintiff] and against [Reliable] for
damages in the principal sum of $43,296.79 plus interest at the rate of ten
percent (10%) from June 10, 2020 and court costs,” less credit for Reliable’s
payments to Plaintiff before the default. 
On
March 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to vacate the dismissal, enforce the settlement,
and enter judgment against Reliable, to be heard on May 22, 2024.  Reliable did not file an opposition. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to vacate the dismissal, enforce the settlement, and enter
judgment against Reliable. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides in part: 
“(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement. 
“(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed
by a party if it is signed by any of the following: 
“(1) The party. 
“(2) An attorney who represents the party. 
“(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is
authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer’s behalf.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6,
subds. (a), (b).) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
and Reliable stipulated that the Court would dismiss the action without
prejudice.  In return, Reliable agreed to
make installment payments to Plaintiff totaling $43,296.96.  If Reliable failed to make payments,
Plaintiff could request the entry of judgment against Reliable for the amount
still owed. 
Reliable
made $7,608.08 in payments to Plaintiff but then defaulted.  Plaintiff asks the Court to enter judgment
against Reliable and award $42,930.01.  Plaintiff’s counsel has submitted a
declaration stating that the amount of the requested
judgment “is calculated pursuant to paragraphs, 1, 4, and 5 of the Stipulation
as follows: as follows: $35,
688.71 unpaid principal; $6,717.30 interest at the rate of 5% per annum on the
unpaid principal; $524.00 costs for filing and service of process.” 
Under
the stipulation, the declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel “shall be conclusive
proof of the fact of default of [Reliable] and of the amount then owing by
[Reliable] to [Plaintiff].”  (Stipulation
¶ 8.) 
The
Court grants the motion, vacates the November 29, 2021
dismissal, and awards Plaintiff $42,930.01 against Reliable.
