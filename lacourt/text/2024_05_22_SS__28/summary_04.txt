And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Court's Tentative Ruling addresses the parties' disputes regarding costs of suit and expert witness expenses. After reviewing the parties' filings, including the Plaintiff's Notice of Appeal and the Defendant's Motion to Tax Costs, the Court concludes that the Defendant's Motion to Tax Costs is moot due to the parties' recent stipulation, which waives costs of suit against the Plaintiff and dismisses the notice of appeal. As a result, the Court takes the hearing on the motion to tax costs off calendar as moot.
