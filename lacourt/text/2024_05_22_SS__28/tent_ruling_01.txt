LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling
a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent
exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or
any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored
information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of
the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides: 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) 
DISCUSSION 
On
February 14, 2024, Moving Defendants served supplemental interrogatories and
supplemental requests for production on Plaintiff.  On February 15, 2024, Moving Defendants
served special interrogatories, set two, and requests for production, set two,
on Plaintiff.  On February 23, 2024,
Moving Defendants served special interrogatories, set three, and requests for
production, set four, on Plaintiff.  On
February 26, 2024, Moving Defendants served special interrogatories, set four,
on Plaintiff. 
Plaintiff
did not provide timely responses and had not provided responses by the time Moving
Defendants filed these motions on April 26, 2024. 
In supplemental
oppositions to the motions filed on May 20, 2024, Plaintiff contends that the motions are moot
because she served verified responses to the discovery. 
In supplemental replies, Moving Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s belated responses
are in bad faith and do not comply with the relevant provisions of the Code of
Civil Procedure. 
In Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390 (Sinaiko), the Court of Appeal rejected the argument
that, because the defendants served untimely responses to the plaintiff’s
interrogatories, the plaintiff’s sole remedy was to move to compel further
responses to the interrogatories.  The
Court of Appeal held: “[T]he service of an untimely interrogatory response,
which may or may not reflect a good faith effort to comply with the party’s
discovery obligations, does not divest the trial court of authority to hear and
grant a motion to compel responses under [Code of Civil Procedure] section
2030.290, subdivision (b). Whether the trial court should proceed with a motion
to compel responses under section 2030.290 when there has been an untimely
interrogatory response is within the sound discretion of the trial court.”  (Id. at p. 396.) 
In Sinaiko,
“[t]he trial court . . . knew that defendants had served [untimely] interrogatory
responses, but also had a reasonable basis to conclude that defendants had not,
in effect, responded to form interrogatories 50.1 through 50.6 [due to defendants’
failure to provide substantive responses]. Defendants had the opportunity to
put their interrogatory responses before the trial court and to make whatever
arguments they deemed appropriate to oppose the motion. They did not. The trial
court was not required to speculate about what defendants’ interrogatory
responses might have contained. For this reason, the trial court had authority
to grant Sinaiko’s motion and did not abuse its discretion in doing so.”  (Sinaiko, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th
at p. 406.) 
Here,
Moving Defendants argue that the “bad faith” of Plaintiff’s untimely discovery responses is
illustrated by Plaintiff’s assertion, in her untimely responses, that she had no additional responses to
the supplemental interrogatories and supplemental requests for production,
despite the disclosure of Plaintiff’s traumatic brain injury after Plaintiff’s
previous responses.  Plaintiff did not
dispute this point in her “further oppositions” filed on May 21, 2024.
Based
on the reasoning of Sinaiko, the Court concludes that Moving Defendants’
motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses to supplemental requests for production
and supplemental interrogatories are not moot. 
The Court grants these portions of Moving Defendants’ motions.  The Court orders Plaintiff to provide verified,
code-compliant responses to Plaintiff’s supplemental requests for production of documents without
objections and to produce the documents, electronically stored information,
and/or other things requested without objections by June 21, 2024.  The Court orders Plaintiff to provide
verified, code-compliant responses to Plaintiff’s supplemental interrogatories
without objections by June 21, 2024. 
Moving
Defendants request $7,700.00 in sanctions on the motion to compel responses to
the interrogatories based on 22 hours of attorney time at a rate of $350.00 per
hour.  The Court grants sanctions of
$500.00 based on two hours of attorney time at a reasonable rate of $250.00 per
hour. 
Moving
Defendants request $3,500.00 in sanctions on the motion to compel responses to
the requests for production based on 10 hours of attorney time at a rate of
$350.00 per hour.  The Court grants
sanctions of $500.00 based on two hours of attorney time at a reasonable rate
of $250.00 per hour. 
In
addition, the Court orders Moving Defendants to pay the Court six additional
filing fees totaling $360.00.           
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS in part the motion to compel responses to requests for production
filed by Defendants Harout Broutian as an
individual and Albro, LLC, and orders Plaintiff Larysa Kotandzhyan to provide
verified, code-compliant responses to the supplemental requests for production
of documents without objections and to produce the documents, electronically
stored information, and/or other things requested without objections by June
21, 2024. 
The
Court GRANTS in part the motion to compel responses to interrogatories filed by
Defendants Harout Broutian as an individual and Albro, LLC, and orders
Plaintiff Larysa Kotandzhyan to provide verified, code-compliant responses to
the supplemental interrogatories without objections by June 21, 2024. 
The
Court GRANTS in part the requests for sanctions of Defendants
Harout Broutian as an individual and Albro, LLC, and orders Plaintiff
Larysa Kotandzhyan and her counsel to pay Defendants Harout Broutian as an

Court ORDERS Defendants Harout Broutian as an individual and Albro, LLC, to pay
