And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion filed by Plaintiffs Martha Silva Anguiano and Eduardo Silva (a minor) to vacate the dismissal of their action against Defendant Alexandra Vanessa Peres. The Plaintiffs claim that their failure to appear at the hearing on November 1, 2023, was due to a mistake by their counsel's paralegal. The court has found that the dismissal was the result of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Therefore, the court grants the motion to vacate the dismissal and sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to File Proof of Service of Summons and Complaint for June 21, 2024.
