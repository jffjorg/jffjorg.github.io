The judge has granted the motion of James R. Felton, counsel for Defendants Pelv-Ice, LLC and Jill Bigelow, to be relieved as counsel. The motion is granted for individual Defendant Jill Bigelow without condition, while it is granted for Defendant Pelv-Ice, LLC conditionally. The condition is that counsel must submit a new order indicating that the next hearing will be an OSC re; Striking of Answer on March 3, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. If the entity defendant does not have a new attorney of record by that date, its answer may be struck. The judge has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted if there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.
