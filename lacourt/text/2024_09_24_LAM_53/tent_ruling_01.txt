  Case Number:  21STCV27393    Hearing Date:   September 24, 2024    Dept:  53 Samples v. Northern California
Mortgage Fund XIV, LLC  21STCV27393 
Ex
Parte Application  9/24/24
Plaintiff
filed two ex parte applications on September 23, 2024, which are presented to
the court on September 24, 2024.
First,
the court grants in part, and denies in part, plaintiff’s ex parte application for
order shortening notice and advancing hearing dates or, in the alternative,
advance hearing dates as follows.
The
court orders that the hearing on plaintiff’s motion to continue trial is
advanced from June 25, 2025, to October 31, 2024, at 10:00 a.m.
The
court denies all other relief requested by plaintiff in that ex parte
application.  
The
court finds that plaintiff has not satisfied the requirement of California Rules
of Court, rule 3.1202, subdivision (c), that an applicant for an ex parte order
must make an affirmative factual showing in a declaration containing competent
testimony based on personal knowledge of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or
other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte. 
The
court does not find good cause to grant plaintiff’s request for an order
shortening time on the hearings on the other motions listed in plaintiff’s ex
parte application or to prescribe shorter times for the filing and service of
papers than the times specified in Code of Civil Procedure section 1005,
subdivision (b).  (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1300, subd. (b).)
Second,
the court denies plaintiff’s ex parte application for order to file longer
memorandum.  The court finds that
plaintiff has not shown good cause for the requested relief.  
The court
orders plaintiff to give notice of this order.
