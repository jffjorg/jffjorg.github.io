DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs Oscar George, Robert Margolis, Tiros George Jr., and Tiros
George (“Plaintiffs”) move the court for an order awarding attorney’s fees and costs
in their favor, to be paid from the settlement fund created by the “Settlement
Agreement and Mutual General Release” executed by Plaintiffs, on the one hand,
and defendants Morton Forshpan and Forshpan Capital, LLC (“Defendants”), on the
other hand (the “Settlement”), in the total amount of $90,184.84, consisting of
$51,009.70 in attorney’s fees and $39,175.14 in costs, pursuant to the common
fund doctrine.  (Mot. for Prelim. Approval
of Settlement filed June 11, 2024, Brown Decl., Ex. 1, Settlement, p. 1.) 
First, the court finds that Plaintiffs have shown that they may
recover, from the common fund created by the Settlement, attorney’s fees and
costs pursuant to the common fund doctrine.   
“The common fund doctrine is based on the principle that ‘where a
common fund exists to which a number of persons are entitled and in their
interest successful litigation is maintained for its preservation and
protection, an allowance of counsel fees may properly be made from such
fund.’  [Citation.]  The purpose of the doctrine is to allow a
party, who has paid for counsel to prosecute a lawsuit that creates a fund from
which others will benefit, to require those other beneficiaries to bear their
fair share of the litigation costs. 
[Citation.]  In other words, the
common fund doctrine permits plaintiffs’ attorneys to recoup their fees from
the fund.”  (Northwest Energetic
Services, LLC v. California Franchise Tax Bd. (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 841,
878 [internal citations omitted].)  “The
common-fund doctrine has been held to apply in favor of a plaintiff who has
successfully maintained a stockholder’s derivative action on behalf of a
corporation in this state.”  (Fletcher
v. A.J. Industries, Inc. (1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 313, 320.) 
Here, Plaintiffs have obtained a benefit for the members of nominal
defendant Victorville-Oasis, LLC, by recovering, pursuant to the Settlement, a
gross settlement amount of $193,750, of which (1) $25,000 is to be allocated to
Plaintiffs for their efforts, and (2) the remainder, after accounting for
attorney’s fees and costs, is to be paid, proportional to their interests in
the company, to the members of Victorville-Oasis, LLC.  (Mot. for Prelim. Approval of Settlement
filed June 11, 2024, Brown Decl., Ex. 1, Settlement, ¶ 3.)  Thus, Plaintiffs have secured a benefit on
behalf of the other members of Victorville-Oasis, LLC. 
The court notes that Plaintiffs also appear to have obtained an
individual benefit, separate and apart from the common fund created for the
members of Victorville-Oasis, LLC. Specifically, pursuant to the Settlement, $25,000
of the $193,750 settlement amount will be paid to Plaintiffs “for their
efforts, labor, and time involved[.]” 
(Mot. for Prelim. Approval of Settlement filed June 11, 2024, Brown
Decl., Ex. 1, Settlement, ¶ 3.)  “[W]hen
a shareholder brings a derivative suit for the true purpose of advancing his or
her ‘personal adverse interests,’ neither equitable doctrine [i.e., neither the
common fund nor substantial benefit doctrines] allows an award of attorney
fees.”  (Cziraki v. Thunder Cats, Inc.
(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 552, 558.)  However,
the award to Plaintiffs for bringing this action does not appear to show that
they filed this suit for the “true purpose” of advancing their own personal
adverse interests against Victorville-Oasis, LLC.  Moreover, Defendants have not filed an
opposition to this motion contending that this exception to the common fund
doctrine applies. 
The court therefore finds that Plaintiffs have shown that they may
recover, from the common fund created by the Settlement, attorney’s fees and
costs.  (Northwest Energetic Services,
LLC, supra, 159 Cal.App.4th at p. 878.) 
Second, the court finds that Plaintiffs have supported their request
for attorney’s fees in the amount of $51,009.70. 
“[T]he fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the
‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate. . . . .¿ The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing
in the community for similar work.¿ The lodestar figure may then be adjusted,
based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee
at the fair market value for the legal services provided.”¿ (PLCM Group v.
Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 (internal citations omitted); Reck
v. FCA US LLC (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 682, 691 [“To determine a reasonable
attorney fee award, the trial court applies the lodestar method”].) 
“[T]he verified time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are
entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are
erroneous.”¿ (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State Univ.
(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396.)¿¿¿ 
Plaintiffs have submitted the declaration of attorney Ethan Brown, in
which he attests to the qualifications, skill, and experience of himself and attorney
Barnes.  (Brown Decl., ¶¶ 7-9.)  The court finds that the hourly rates
requested for attorneys Brown ($795) and Barnes ($495) are reasonable in light
of counsel’s qualifications and experience. 
(Ibid.)  The court further
finds, upon reviewing the time entries attached to the declaration of Brown,
that Plaintiffs have shown that their attorneys reasonably expended approximately
299 hours in prosecuting and litigating this action.[1]  (Brown Decl., Ex. A, Time Entries.)  Defendants did not file an opposition to this
motion contending that any of the hours claimed were unreasonable or
unnecessary, and the court has found that the hours expended were reasonable.  (Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp. (2009)
178 Cal.App.4th 44, 101 [“The party opposing the fee award can be expected to
identify the particular charges it considers objectionable”].) 
The court therefore finds that Plaintiffs have established a lodestar
amount of $151,453.50 ((11 hours x Brown’s $795 hourly rate) + (288.3 hours x
Barnes’ $495 hourly rate)).  However, Plaintiffs
have requested $51,009.70 on the ground that their fee agreement entitles
counsel to 33 percent of their recovery.[2]  (Brown Decl., ¶ 3.)  Thus, the court grants Plaintiffs’ request
for an award of attorney’s fees in the amount of $51,009.70.
Third, the court finds that Plaintiffs have supported their request
for costs in the amount of $38,440.83, and therefore grants their request to
award costs from the common fund in that amount.  (Northwest Energetic Services, LLC, supra,
159 Cal.App.4th at p. 878 [purpose of common fund doctrine is to allow a party
to require beneficiaries to bear their fair share of litigation costs]; Brown
Decl., Ex. B, Expense Report.)  
The court denies Plaintiffs’ request to recover copying and postage
costs in the amount of $734.28 because “postage . . . and photocopying charges,
except for exhibits[,]” are not allowable as costs unless “expressly authorized
by law[,]” and Plaintiffs did not (1) identify a law expressly authorizing
these costs, or (2) present evidence showing that the copying charges were
related to exhibits.  (Brown Decl., Ex.
B, Expense Report, PDF pp. 33 [$150.30 for printing and copying], 34 [$46.20
for printing and copying, $9.90 for printing and copying, $1.75 for postage],
35 [$1.80 for printing and copying, $12.45 for printing and copying, $64.80 for
printing and copying, $0.89 for postage, $3.30 for printing and copying, $48
for printing and copying, $0.67 for postage, $29.40 for printing and copying,
$1.05 for printing and copying, $64.85 for printing and copying], 36 [$1.34 for
postage, $0.22 for postage, $13.04 for postage, $0.67 for postage, $2.03 for
postage, $6.83 for postage, $65.85 for printing and copying, $144.75 for
printing and copying, $5.42 for postage, $55.50 for printing and copying, $0.67
for postage, $0.46 for postage], 37 [$1.20 for printing and copying, $0.47 for
postage, $0.47 for postage]; Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (b)(3).)
