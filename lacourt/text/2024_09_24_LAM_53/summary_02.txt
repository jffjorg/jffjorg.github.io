And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has made a tentative ruling regarding a petition for approval of a compromise of claim on behalf of a minor claimant, Ethan Gill, and a motion to seal filed by defendants Ford Motor Company and South Bay Ford. The court has noted two defects with the petition: first, the proposed order does not complete all required sections and attaches a redacted copy of Attachment 8b(2); and second, the redacted version of the proposed order is not identified as "Public-Redacts materials from conditionally sealed record." Therefore, the court has exercised its discretion to continue the hearing on the petition and motion to seal to allow the petitioner to correct these defects. The court has ordered the petitioner to lodge a complete unredacted version of the proposed order and file a redacted version of the proposed order that identifies it as "Public-Redacts materials from conditionally sealed record." The hearing on both the petition and motion to seal is continued to September 26, 2024, at 10:00 a.m.
