The court finds that the common fund doctrine allows the plaintiffs to recover attorney's fees and costs from the fund, and that the plaintiffs have shown that they reasonably expended 299 hours in prosecuting and litigating this action. The court also finds that the hourly rates requested by the attorneys are reasonable and that the plaintiffs have established a lodestar amount of $151,453.50. However, the court grants the plaintiffs' request for an award of attorney's fees in the amount of $51,009.70, which is 33% of their recovery. The court also grants the plaintiffs' request for costs in the amount of $38,440.83.
