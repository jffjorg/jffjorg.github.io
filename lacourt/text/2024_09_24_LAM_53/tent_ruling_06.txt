The court notes that Brown has stated, in his declaration, that he incurred a
total of 11 hours and attorney Barnes incurred a total of 288.3 hours in
connection with bringing this action, although (1) the time entries state that
Plaintiffs’ legal staff incurred a total of 304 hours, 21 minutes, and (2) the
second timesheet entry appears to set forth an additional 40.60 hours expended
by counsel in this action.  (Brown Decl.,
¶¶ 8-9; Brown Decl., Ex. A, Time Entries, PDF pp. 28, 31.)  Because it appears that Plaintiffs have argued
that the lodestar should be calculated based on 299 hours expended by counsel,
the court has used that number in calculating the lodestar amount.  (See, e.g., Mot., pp. 4:13-15, 5:26-27.)

The court notes that counsel has described the parties’ fee agreement to award to
counsel “33% of the first $600,00[0] recovered[.]”  (Brown Decl., ¶ 3.)  This appears to indicate that counsel would
be entitled to recover 33 percent of the $193,750 settlement amount, which
would amount to approximately $63,937.50. 
However, Plaintiffs have requested only $51,009.70.  The court has therefore awarded that amount.
