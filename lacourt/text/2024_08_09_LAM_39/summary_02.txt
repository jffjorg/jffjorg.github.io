```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling grants Defendant Maki Gruninger's motion to set aside the default and default judgment entered against her. The court finds that Plaintiff Mami Martinez did not properly serve Defendant, as evidenced by the declarations of Defendant and Stephen B. Kass, which show that Defendant was not present at the address where service was purportedly made on August 24, 2023. The court also finds that Plaintiff's attempts to authenticate the photograph of Defendant, which was used to support service, are inadmissible and rely on hearsay statements. As a result, the default and default judgment are deemed void, and the court grants Defendant's motion for relief from default and default judgment.
