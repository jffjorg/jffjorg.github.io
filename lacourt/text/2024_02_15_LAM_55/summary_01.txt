And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling grants the City of Burbank's motion for summary judgment and denies Plaintiff Sami Ammari's request for a continuance. The case involves a dispute over the City's enforcement of Burbank Municipal Code § 6-1-1010, which impounds motor vehicles owned by Plaintiff. The Plaintiff did not file an opposition to the summary judgment motion and instead sought a continuance to amend the complaint. The Judge denied the continuance, citing lack of justifiable explanation for the delay and failure to include the proposed pleading as required. The Judge also found that the Plaintiff's claims already cover the proposed allegations and therefore the Plaintiff has no merit. The Judge granted the City's motion for summary judgment, finding that the Plaintiff cannot establish that the code violates their due process or equal protection rights.
