And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendant, Inglot USA, LLC. The demurrer, which challenges the sufficiency of the plaintiff's claims, is overruled, and the motion to strike, which seeks to strike certain allegations from the plaintiff's complaint, is denied.

The judge finds that the plaintiff, Aderiike Lawal, has adequately pleaded facts to state a claim for intentional discrimination under the Unruh Civil Rights Act (UCRA) and a claim for violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The judge also finds that the plaintiff's allegations of a policy of denying visually impaired individuals like herself full access to the defendant's website are sufficient to state a claim for intentional discrimination.

The judge denies the motion to strike the allegations regarding the statutory penalties of $4,000 for "each offense" or "per violation" of the UCRA, finding that these allegations are not prejudicial to the defendant.

The defendant has 20 days to answer the complaint.
