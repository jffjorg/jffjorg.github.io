Roles:
  - Judge

  - Defendant
Significant Statements:
  - "A demurrer should be sustained only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed."
  - "A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters."
  - "A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures."
  - "This court previously sustained Defendant’s demurrer to this cause of action in an order dated November 21, 2023..."
  - "This is insufficient. One has engaged in protected activity when they have ‘opposed any practices forbidden under this part or . . . filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this part.’"
  - "Standing alone, an employee's unarticulated belief that an employer is engaging in discrimination will not suffice to establish protected conduct for the purposes of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation, where there is no evidence the employer knew that the employee's opposition was based upon a reasonable belief that the employer was engaging in discrimination."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has sustained the demurrer filed by DCH Torrance Imports, Inc. (Defendant) to the Plaintiff's Fifth Cause of Action for FEHA retaliation, without leave to amend. The judge concludes that the Plaintiff's allegations of protected activity, namely "praying in accordance with his religious creed", are insufficient to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under FEHA. The judge notes that the Plaintiff's protected activity must be opposition to any practices forbidden under FEHA, such as filing a complaint, testifying, or assisting in a proceeding. The judge finds that praying in accordance with one's religious creed is not opposition to any practice forbidden by FEHA, and therefore does not constitute protected activity for the purposes of FEHA retaliation.
