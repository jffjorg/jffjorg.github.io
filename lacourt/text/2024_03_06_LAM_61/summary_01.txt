And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiffs' motion for sanctions against the Defendant, County of Los Angeles. The motion was filed due to the Defendant's failure to comply with a court order to provide a further response to Special Interrogatory No. 5, which asked for dates of sewage overflows from manhole 1634-239. The Defendant provided a further response, stating that it is unclear whether two other overflows occurred from manhole 1654-239. The Judge ruled that no sanctions are warranted because the Plaintiffs' evidence does not foreclose the possibility that the overflows originated from manhole 238, located on adjacent property. The Defendant had requested $7,785.00 in sanctions, but the Judge denied the motion.
