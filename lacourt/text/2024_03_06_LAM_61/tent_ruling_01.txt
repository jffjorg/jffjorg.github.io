I.                  
MOTION
FOR SANCTIONS
“If a party then
fails to obey an order compelling further response to interrogatories, the
court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue
sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of, or in addition to, that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300, subd. (e).)
 
Plaintiffs Sina and
Azadeh Mardani (Plaintiffs) move for issue and monetary sanctions against
Defendant County of Los Angeles (Defendant) based on Defendant’s failure to
comply with this court’s order of September 12, 2023, directing Defendant to
provide a further response to Special Interrogatory No. 5.
 
The relevant history
is as follows. Special Interrogatory No. 5 asked Defendant to list all dates on
which a sewage overflow occurred from manhole 1634-239 in a period dating from
the inception of Defendant’s assumption of control over the sewer until 2008.
Defendant’s response at the time of the September 12, 2023 hearing was that it
had provided documents to Plaintiffs from which the answer could be derived,
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.230. But this court ordered a
further response, because Defendant subsequently challenged the dates that
Plaintiffs derived from the materials presented, and argued that the attempt to
derive dates from the documents were speculative. Defendant has since provided
a further response, stating as follows:
 
From the period of April 18, 1995, to April
2008, this responding party identifies the following: January 13, 2001, work order
1012563, appears to relate to manhole 1654-239, but because the specific number
for the manhole is not identified in the County's records, it is unclear if
this overflow was in fact from manhole 1654-239; September 29, 2004, work order
2014987; and October 19, 2006, work order 2579964, but because the manhole is
not identified in the County's records, it is unclear if this overflow was from
manhole 1654-239 or 1654-238. 
 
(Motion Exh. L.) Defendant’s
new responses thus affirmatively acknowledge one pre-2008 date of overflow from
manhole 239, that occurring in September 2004. But for those occurring in
January 2001 and October 2006, Defendant states that it is unclear whether the
overflows originated from manhole 239.
 
Plaintiffs argue
that these responses are insufficient, because available evidence indicates
that the 2001 and 2006 overflows took place on Plaintiffs’ property, and the
only other manhole from which the overflows could have originated (based on
subsequent maintenance records) is manhole 238, located on adjacent property
that does not belong to Plaintiffs. (Motion at p. 5.)
 
No sanction is
warranted, because Plaintiffs’ evidence does not foreclose that the 2001 and
2006 overflows originated from manhole 238. Plaintiffs merely note that the
overflows were reported from Plaintiffs’ address and that subsequent
maintenance focused on the segment between manholes 239 (on their property) and
manhole 238 (on adjacent property). (Motion Exh. D.) But because flowing sewage
pays little respect to property lines, the evidence that the prior property
owner on Plaintiffs’ property reported the overflow does not foreclose the inference
that the overflow originated from a manhole on adjacent property, when that
manhole was serviced following the overflow. Defendant is not obliged to
embrace all inferences from the evidence favorable to Plaintiffs when other
inferences are available.
 
The motion is
therefore DENIED. Defendant’s request for $7,785.00 in sanctions, representing
17.30 hours of attorney work at $450 per hour, under Code of Civil Procedure §
2023.010, subd. (h), which describes “[m]aking or opposing,
unsuccessfully and without substantial justification, a motion to compel or to
limit discovery” as a misuse of discovery. (Thomas Decl. at p. 6.) No sanctions are awarded.
