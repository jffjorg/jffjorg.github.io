Defendant to give notice.
 
I.                  
DEMURRER
A demurrer should be sustained only where the defects appear
on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Code Civ. Pro., §§
430.30, et seq.) In particular, as is
relevant here, a court should sustain a demurrer if a complaint does not allege
facts that are legally sufficient to constitute a cause of action. (See
id. § 430.10, subd. (e).) As the Supreme Court held in Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311:
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but
not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. . . . Further, we
give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its
parts in their context.” (Id. at
p. 318; see also Hahn. v. Mirda
(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747 [“A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not
the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.
[Citation.]”) 
 
“In determining whether the complaint is sufficient as
against the demurrer … if on consideration of all the facts stated it appears
the plaintiff is entitled to any relief at the hands of the court against the
defendants the complaint will be held good although the facts may not be
clearly stated.”  (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 639.)
 
“A demurrer
for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some
respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of Cal., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612,
616.) Such demurrers “are disfavored,
and are granted only if the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant
cannot reasonably respond.” (Mahan v.
Charles W. Chan Insurance Agency, Inc. (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 841, 848.)
 
A demurrer should not be sustained without leave to amend if
the complaint, liberally construed, can state a cause of action under any
theory or if there is a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured by
amendment. (Schifando v. City of Los Angeles, supra, 31 Cal.4th at p.
1081.) The demurrer also may be sustained without leave to amend where the
nature of the defects and previous unsuccessful attempts to plead render it
probable plaintiff cannot state a cause of action. (Krawitz v. Rusch
(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 957, 967.)
 
Defendant DCH Torrance Imports, Inc. (Defendant) once again
demurrers to the fifth cause of action for FEHA retaliation, now amended in the
First Amended Complaint (FAC), on the grounds that Plaintiff Mohamed Taqieldin (Plaintiff) fails to allege
that he engaged in protected activity. (Demurrer at pp. 4–5.) 
 
“To establish a prima facie case
of retaliation under FEHA, “a plaintiff must show ‘(1) he or she engaged in a
“protected activity,” (2) the employer subjected the employee to an adverse
employment action, and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity
and the employer's action.” (Nealy v. City of Santa Monica (2015) 234
Cal.App.4th 359, 380.) 
This court previously sustained Defendant’s demurrer to
this cause of action in an order dated November 21, 2023, on the grounds that
Plaintiff had not alleged that he had complained of or opposed conduct
forbidden by the FEHA, but had merely alleged that he had complained about “the
actions of his supervisors” and “the actions of [Defendant’s] employees.
(Complaint ¶¶ 63–64.) Leave to amend was granted to flesh out this allegation.
The FAC contains no mention of the above complaints. It
instead alleges that the protected conduct for which Plaintiff suffered
retaliation was “praying in accordance with his religious creed.” (FAC ¶ 66.) This
is insufficient. One has engaged in protected activity when they have “opposed
any practices forbidden under this part or . . . filed a complaint, testified,
or assisted in any proceeding under this part.” (Gov. Code, § 12940, subd.
(h).) While relevant to Plaintiff’s discrimination and harassment claims,
engaging in religious prayers does not constitute opposition to any practice
forbidden by the FEHA. “Standing alone, an employee's unarticulated belief that
an employer is engaging in discrimination will not suffice to establish
protected conduct for the purposes of establishing a prima facie case of
retaliation, where there is no evidence the employer knew that the employee's
opposition was based upon a reasonable belief that the employer was engaging in
discrimination.” (Castro-Ramirez v. Dependable Highway Express, Inc.
(2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 1028, 1046.) 
This is not protected activity for the purposes of FEHA
retaliation.
