The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff is seeking a total of $496,666.54, including damages, interest, and costs, but the judge has found that the calculations in the supporting declaration do not add up to this amount. Additionally, the principal damages shown in the declaration do not match the principal damages requested in the complaint. As a result, the judge has denied the request for default judgment without prejudice, allowing the plaintiff to re-file or proceed with the case.
