  Case Number:  22TRCV00312    Hearing Date:   November 1, 2024    Dept:  P The request for default is denied without prejudice. 
Plaintiff seeks default judgment against Defendants in the
total amount of $496,666.54, including $487,097.77 in damages, $8,968.77 in
interest, and $600.00 in costs. Plaintiff submits the Declaration of Robin
Merrel in support of damages sought. However, Merrel asserts that the total
amount of loss was $485,191.77.  Therefore, the calculations in the
declaration do not add up to the requested amount. Further, the principal
damages shown by the exhibits in the declaration do not add up to the principal
damages requested in the complaint, JUD-100, or CIV-100.
As a consequence of the above, the request for entry of
default judgment is denied without prejudice.
