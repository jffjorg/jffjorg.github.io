And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has denied the defendant's motion to continue the trial without prejudice. The defendant had requested to continue the trial from February 13, 2024 to a new date, citing the need to complete outstanding discovery and prepare for trial. However, the Judge found that the defendant had not shown good cause to continue the trial. The defendant's argument was that they needed more time to complete discovery, but they did not provide specific reasons why this was necessary. The Judge also noted that the defendant had not filed a summary judgment motion, only reserved a hearing date for one. As a result, the Judge denied the motion to continue the trial, but allowed the defendants to renew the motion if they file a summary judgment motion or if other circumstances warrant a renewed motion.
