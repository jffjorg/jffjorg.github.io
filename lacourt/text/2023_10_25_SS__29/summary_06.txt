And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting summary judgment in favor of the Defendants, Richard Roe, M.D., and Retina Vitreous Associates Medical Group. The Plaintiff, Fredy Alvarez, alleged medical negligence against Defendant Roe, alleging that he failed to properly treat a retinal detachment in his right eye.

The judge found that the Defendants had presented sufficient evidence to show that they complied with the standard of care in treating the Plaintiff's condition. The judge relied on the expert testimony of Dr. Mark Smith, who testified that Defendant Roe's care and treatment were consistent with the standard of care for a reasonably careful medical professional.

The judge noted that the Plaintiff had not filed an opposition to the motion for summary judgment, nor had they presented any evidence to contradict the expert testimony of Dr. Smith. As a result, the judge found that the Plaintiff had failed to show that there was a triable issue of material fact regarding the cause of action for medical negligence.

Accordingly, the judge granted the Defendants' motion for summary judgment, dismissing the Plaintiff's claims with prejudice.
