And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to continue the hearing on the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Peter Bronstein, counsel for the plaintiff Rogelio Magana Castillo. The motion was filed on September 28, 2023, and the hearing is set for October 25, 2023. The judge has determined that the motion has shown a sufficient basis to be relieved and has satisfied all substantive and procedural requirements for the requested order. However, the proposed order must be revised to reflect subsequent developments, including a newly filed motion and a trial continuance. The judge will hear the motion briefly and allow counsel to submit a revised proposed order or will delay the effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court.
