And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to set aside or vacate the dismissal of Defendant Courtney. The Plaintiff had filed a complaint alleging motor vehicle negligence, and later voluntarily dismissed Defendant Courtney. However, the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal was filed more than one month after the deadline, which is jurisdictional. The Judge found that the Plaintiff's motion was untimely and did not meet the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). Therefore, the motion was denied.
