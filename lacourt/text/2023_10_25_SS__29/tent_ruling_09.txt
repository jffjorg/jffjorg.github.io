 Case Number:  22STCV05210    Hearing Date:   October 25, 2023    Dept:  29   TENTATIVE   The motion to  compel is granted.   Background    On February 10,  2022, Plaintiff Albert Knowles (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against  Defendants Daniel Lu, M.D., The Regents of the University of California (“UC”)  and Does 1 through 20, asserting a cause of action for general negligence.    On June 9 and  August 21, 2023, Defendants UC and Lu filed answers to the complaint.   On June 21, 2023,  UC served discovery on Plaintiff, including Requests for Production (Set  One).  (Wysocky Decl., ¶ 3 & Exh.  A.)  As of the date of filing of this  motion, Plaintiff had not served a response to the discovery request.  (Id., ¶ 4.)   On August 31,  2023, UC filed this motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to the discovery  request.  No opposition has been filed.    The Court is aware  that other discovery motions are pending in this matter.   Legal Standard    A party must respond to requests for production of documents  within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a  party to whom requests for production of documents are directed does not  provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order compelling  response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time  limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts  are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,  Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)  Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who  fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)  Discussion   On June 21, 2023,  UC served Plaintiff with Requests for Production (Set One).  (Wysocky Decl., ¶ 3 & Exh. A.)  Plaintiff has not served a response.  (Id., ¶ 4.)s  UC need show  nothing more.  Its motion to compel is GRANTED. Conclusion The Court GRANTS UC’s motion  to compel. Plaintiff is ORDERED to  provide verified, code-compliant, written responses, without objections, to UC’s  Requests for Production of Documents (Set  One) within 30 days of the notice of this order. Moving party is ordered to give notice.
