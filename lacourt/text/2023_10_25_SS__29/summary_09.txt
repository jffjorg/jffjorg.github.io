And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the University of California's (UC) motion to compel Albert Knowles, the plaintiff, to respond to discovery requests. The plaintiff had not responded to the discovery requests, which were served on June 21, 2023. The judge noted that there is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. The judge also stated that a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections. The judge ordered the plaintiff to provide verified, code-compliant, written responses, without objections, to UC's Requests for Production of Documents (Set One) within 30 days of the notice of this order.
