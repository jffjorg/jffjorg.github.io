 Case Number:  21STCV15566    Hearing Date:   October 25, 2023    Dept:  29 Tentative
 
The motion is continued.
 
Background
 
On April 26, 2021, Plaintiff Rogelio Magana
Castillo filed a complaint against Defendant Kimberly Brooks for (1) intentional
infliction of emotional distress, (2) assault, and (3) battery.  
 
On September 28, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel,
Peter Bronstein, filed this motion to be relieved as counsel.  
 
Legal
Standard
 
The court may order that an attorney
be changed or substituted at any time before or after judgment or final
determination upon request by either client or attorney and after notice from
one to the other. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted
to withdraw where conflicts between the attorney and client make it
unreasonable to continue the representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof.
Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The determination whether to grant or deny a motion
to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as
counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and
Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be
served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the
case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay
effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy
of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has shown a sufficient basis to be relieved and has satisfied all
of the substantive and procedural requirements for the requested order.  
 
The proposed order must list all upcoming dates, and although it was
accurate when filed, there have been subsequent developments (including a newly
filed motion and a trial continuance) that have rendered the proposed order
inaccurate at this time.  Accordingly, the
Court will continue the hearing briefly to allow counsel to submit a revised
proposed order (unless counsel is able to submit an updated proposed order in
advance of the hearing,)
 
Conclusion
 
The motion to
be relieved as counsel is CONTINUED.   
 
Moving
counsel to give notice.
