The motion
is granted. 
 
Background¿ 
 
On June 7, 2018, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed
a Complaint against Defendant Erin Lisen (“Defendant”).  
 
On September 9, 2022, this action was ordered dismissed pursuant to
the stipulation for dismissal with reservation to vacate and enter judgment
upon breach.  The court retained
jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. 
 
On August 10, 2023, Defendant filed the instant motion to vacate
dismissal and enter judgment.  No
opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard 
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides a summary procedure that enables
judges to enforce a settlement agreement by entering a judgment pursuant to the
terms of the parties’ settlement.  In particular, the statute provides: 
 
(a) If parties to pending
litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside of the
presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case,
or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the
terms of the settlement.  If requested by the parties, the court may
retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement. 
 
(b) For purposes of this
section, a writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any of the
following: 
 
(1) The party. 
(2) An attorney who represents
the party. 
(3) If the party is an insurer,
an agent who is authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer's
behalf. 
 
Code of Civ. Pro., § 664.6 subd. (a)-(b). 
 
Discussion 
 
The Court finds that it has retained jurisdiction to enter
judgment pursuant to the parties’ Stipulation in this action.  
 
The Stipulation provides that Defendant agreed to make
monthly payments to settle this matter. 
(Declaration of Harlan M. Reese, ¶ 2;
Ex. “A.”) Defendant’s
insurance carrier made a one-time payment in the amount of $9,181.94.  (Reese Decl., ¶ 4.)  Defendant
made monthly payments pursuant to the stipulation totaling $700.00; however,
Defendant has since defaulted on payments. 
(Reese Decl., ¶ 5.)  Plaintiff mailed Defendant a
default letter regarding the missed payments as required.  (Reese Decl., ¶ 6; Ex. “C.”)  Defendant
failed to bring payments current.  (Reese
Decl., ¶ 7.)    
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff has provided evidence that
Defendant stopped making payments and did not respond to Plaintiff’s written
notice of default.  Thus, a valid and signed stipulation
agreement was breached and the Court retained jurisdiction to enter judgment
upon breach.  
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter
Judgment is GRANTED. 
 
The dismissal entered on September 9, 2022, is VACATED.
 
Judgment is ordered to be entered for Plaintiff in the amount
of $2,874.50, calculated as follows: judgment in amount of $12,181.94, less the later payments of
$9,881.94, plus court costs Plaintiff has incurred of $574.50 consisting of:
$435.00 filing fee, $79.50 service fee, $60.00 motion fee, for a total judgment
in the amount of $2,874.50.
 
Conclusion 
 
Plaintiff State Farm
Mutual Automobile Insurance Company’s Motion is GRANTED.
 
The dismissal entered on September 9, 2022, is VACATED.
 
Judgment is ordered to be entered for Plaintiff in the amount
of $2,874.50.
