And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by Marvin V. Adviento and MBA|LEGAL, P.C. to withdraw as counsel for plaintiff/cross-defendant American Royal Crown, Inc. and cross-defendant Houman Bellafard. The judge finds that the counsel has a valid reason for withdrawal, as they are closing their practice to work for a government employer and have provided the required forms and served the client and opposing parties. However, the judge denies the motion because the counsel did not seek to advance the hearing to avoid prejudice to their clients, did not identify a start date for their new employment, and failed to describe any communication efforts with their clients to determine whether they are able to obtain new counsel in a timely fashion.
