  Case Number:  21SMCP00432    Hearing Date:   November 7, 2024    Dept:  N TENTATIVE RULING
 
Currently
pending before the Court are Marvin V. Adviento and MBA|LEGAL, P.C.’s Motions to Withdraw as Counsel for Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
American Royal Crown, Inc. and Cross-Defendant Houman Bellafard.
 
Counsel
has asserted a valid reason for withdrawal, i.e., counsel is closing his
practice to work for a government employer, and counsel has provided the
required forms under rule 3.1362 of the California Rules of Court and served
the client and opposing parties with the same. However, the trial is set for a
week from the date of hearing on this motion, counsel did not seek to advance
the hearing on this motion to avoid prejudice to his clients, he does not
identify a start date for his new employment, and he fails to describe any
communication efforts with the clients to determine whether they are able to
obtain new counsel in a timely fashion. Accordingly, Marvin V. Adviento and
MBA|LEGAL, P.C.’s Motions to
Withdraw as Counsel for Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant American Royal Crown, Inc.
and Cross-Defendant Houman Bellafard are DENIED.
