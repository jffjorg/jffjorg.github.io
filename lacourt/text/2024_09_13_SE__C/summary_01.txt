And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively granted a motion filed by the defendant, Maggie's Pub, to advance the deposition of prisoner defendants in a case related to a bar fight. The original deposition was scheduled for May 1, 2025, but the defendant argued that this was not soon enough. The judge agreed, citing a California rule that allows for ex parte relief in cases where there is irreparable harm or immediate danger. As a result, the deposition is being advanced to September 19, 2024, and the plaintiff is required to submit a proposed order. Notice of the change is being given to the moving party.
