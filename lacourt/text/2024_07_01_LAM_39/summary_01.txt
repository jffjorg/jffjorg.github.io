And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The defendants, Huge USA, Inc. and Jin Ser Park, moved for summary judgment or summary adjudication on the plaintiff's claims for wage and hour violations, intentional infliction of emotional distress, battery, and unfair business practices. The plaintiff, Nam Suk Park, alleged that the defendants failed to pay him overtime compensation, failed to reimburse his expenses, and physically harassed him.

The judge finds that the plaintiff raises triable issues of material fact as to whether he can prevail on his wage and hour claims, including whether he was exempt under the managerial or executive exemption and whether he was entitled to overtime compensation. The judge also finds that the plaintiff raises triable issues of material fact as to whether he can prevail on his claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, including whether Park's physical harassment was intentional and caused the plaintiff emotional distress.

The judge further finds that the plaintiff raises triable issues of material fact as to whether he can prevail on his claim for battery, including whether Park's physical contact with the plaintiff was intentional and caused harm. Finally, the judge finds that the plaintiff raises triable issues of material fact as to whether he can prevail on his claim for unfair business practices, including whether the defendants engaged in unfair business practices by failing to pay overtime compensation and reimburse expenses.

Overall, the judge denies the defendants' motion for summary judgment and finds that the plaintiff raises triable issues of material fact as to all of his claims.
