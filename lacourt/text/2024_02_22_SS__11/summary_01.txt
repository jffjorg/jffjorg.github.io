* Hearing Date: February 22, 2024
* Department: 11 Stern

**Parties**

* Plaintiff: Andrew Stern
* Defendants: Hyundai Motor America, Hyundai Capital America, Inc., and Hyundai Lease Titling Trust (HLTT)

**Facts**

* Plaintiff leased a 2020 Hyundai Tucson from KEYES, an authorized dealership, for a 3-year term.
* The Vehicle was stolen and deemed a total loss by the insurance company, Farmers Insurance.
* The pay-off figure obtained from HYUNDAI was $24,905.00, exceeding the Residual Value owed by Plaintiff.
* Plaintiff challenges the validity of Section 25 of the Lease Agreement, which allows HYUNDAI to calculate the pay-off figure based on the "reasonable market value" of the Vehicle.

**Disputes**

* Plaintiff alleges that HYUNDAI's actions and omissions caused him to suffer financial loss, decreased credit rating, and emotional distress.
* HYUNDAI claims that the arbitration provision in the Lease Agreement allows them to compel arbitration with Plaintiff.

**Acts**

* HYUNDAI received $24,905.00 from Farmers Insurance, exceeding the Residual Value owed by Plaintiff.
* HYUNDAI billed Plaintiff an additional $510.30 for the pay-off amount.
* Plaintiff was informed that the $510.30 was the discrepancy between the $1,000 deductible and credits owed to Plaintiff by HYUNDAI.

**Agreements**

* Lease Agreement
* Arbitration Provision (separate document)

**Laws**

* California Motor Vehicle Lease Agreement
* Arbitration Agreement (applicable to employees, agents, successors, or assigns)

**Statutes**

* None mentioned

**Roles**

* Plaintiff: Andrew Stern
* Defendants: Hyundai Motor America, Hyundai Capital America, Inc., and Hyundai Lease Titling Trust (HLTT)
* Judge: David S. Cunningham III

**Significant Statements**

* "Defendants' motion to compel arbitration is denied without prejudice."
* "The incorporation issue is undisputed. The parties agree that Exhibit A is not the arbitration provision and that the lease does not incorporate the arbitration provision by reference."
* "Defendants cannot enforce the arbitration provision – and their motion must be denied – because assigning the lease, alone, was inadequate to assign the arbitration provision; Defendants do not qualify as assigns under the arbitration provision; and Plaintiff's claims against Defendants, which concern the lease, are not founded on or intertwined with the arbitration provision."
