Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
1.                 
Plaintiff has failed to comply with California Rules of
Court rule 3.1110, subdivision (g) (i.e., “[e]xhibits written in a foreign
language must be accompanied by an English translation, certified under oath by
a qualified interpreter”) with respect to Exhibit 3. Plaintiff has not provided
any evidence that Pulido is a “qualified interpreter.”
2.         Plaintiff’s Accounting Manager Sarah
Chaparro (“Chaparro”) attests that Plaintiff’s Wells Fargo bank statement
reflected a deposit on October 24, 2022 of only $5,000.00 and a deposit on
October 26, 2022 of only $750.00. Chaparro is requested to provide the court
with a copy of the referenced Wells Fargo bank statement.
