  - "The lodestar is the basic fee for comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award…." (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc.)
  - "The burden is on the party seeking attorney fees to prove reasonableness of the fees." (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino)
  - "The court need not explain its calculation of the amount of a reasonable attorney's fee award which will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi v. County of Monterey)

English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the County's motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $42,000.00. The County is the prevailing party on the special motion to strike the Plaintiff's defamation cause of action. The judge awards the County attorney's fees based on the lodestar approach, using a blended hourly rate of $700 per hour and 60 hours of reasonably expended time. The judge finds that the County's initial request for attorney's fees was excessive and reduces the amount to $42,000.00. The judge also notes that the County's initial request for attorney's fees was "shocking the conscience of the court."
