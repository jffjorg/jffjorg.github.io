And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

**Tentative Ruling**

The court has reviewed the motion for summary adjudication of punitive damages filed by the defendant, Single Room Occupancy Housing Corporation. The court has considered the evidence presented by both parties and has determined that the defendant's motion is DENIED.

The court has found that the defendant has failed to meet its burden of showing that the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages is without merit. The court has concluded that the plaintiff has established a triable issue of fact by which a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the defendant or a managing agent acted with malice, oppression, or fraud.

The court has also considered the applicable "clear and convincing evidence" standard and has found that the plaintiff has established a triable issue of fact by which a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the defendant or a managing agent acted with malice, oppression, or fraud.

Accordingly, the court has denied the defendant's motion for summary adjudication of punitive damages.
