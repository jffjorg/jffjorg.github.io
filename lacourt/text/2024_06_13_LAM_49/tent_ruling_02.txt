 Case Number:  23STCV12356    Hearing Date:   June 13, 2024    Dept:  49 Melani Cargle M.D., M.B.A. v. The County of Los Angeles, et al.DEFENDANT COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES’ MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS MOVING PARTY: Defendant County of Los AngelesRESPONDING PARTY(S): Plaintiff Melani Cargle, M.D.STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: Plaintiff Melani Cargle, M.D., obtained her medical degree from UCLA. Plaintiff alleges she is “African American, female, and queer,” and suffers from ADHD. While attending medical school, Plaintiff alleges a supervising physician, Dr. Louis Kwong, M.D., carried a concealed firearm in the hospital and frequently made racist, sexist, and homophobic remarks. Plaintiff complained to medical school leadership, but the issues were never resolved. Plaintiff alleges that in November or December of 2019, she published a detailed complaint of Dr. Kwong in the Orthopedic-Match Document, which resulted in an investigation of Dr. Kwong. Plaintiff alleges she was later passed for a residency at UCLA based on her complaints. In March 2020, Plaintiff started her residency at USC/Keck. As part of her residency, Plaintiff was required to obtain employment with the County. Plaintiff alleges she faced abuse and racism at the hands of supervising physicians, and that the program failed to offer her accommodations for her ADHD. On May 19, 2022, the County provided Plaintiff with a Notice of Intent to Discharge. The County cited alleged “discourteous, unprofessional, and unethical conduct towards co-workers and patients” and “failure to perform duties as required” as reasons for Plaintiff’s intended discharge.After her discharge, Plaintiff made posts on Twitter about the program and started a GoFundMe. In or about June of 2022, Plaintiff alleges the County sent out a county-wide email, also posted on twitter, personally attacking Plaintiff by name.Plaintiff now brings causes of action for (1) discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or sexual orientation, (2) harassment on the basis of race, sex, or sexual orientation, (3) discrimination on the basis of disability, (4) retaliation, (5) Violation of Health and Safety Code section 1278.5, (6) wrongful termination, (7) failure to reasonably accommodate, (8) failure to engage in the interactive process, (9) aiding and abetting, and (10) defamation.On December 12, 2023, this court granted the County’s special motion to strike the tenth cause of action for defamation. The County now moves to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees. Plaintiff opposed.TENTATIVE RULING:Defendant’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED in the total amount of $42,000.00.If desired, Defendant may file and serve a proposed interim judgment consistent with this and the prior rulings of this court.Moving party is ordered to give notice, unless waived.DISCUSSION:Motion for Attorney’s FeesI. Legal StandardA prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike “shall” be entitled to recover its attorney’s fees and costs.  (CCP 425.16(c)(1).) A party may file a noticed motion for attorney's fees after receiving a successful ruling on the anti-SLAPP motion. (Martin v. Inland Empire Utilities Agency (2011) 198 Cal. App. 4th 611, 631.)The determination of reasonable amount of attorney fees is within the sound discretion of trial courts.  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095; Akins v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. (2000) 79 Cal. App. 4th 1127, 1134.)  “The determination of what constitutes a reasonable fee generally ‘begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate….’”  “[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award….”  (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)  In setting the hourly rate for an attorney fees award, courts are entitled to consider the rate of “‘fees customarily charged by that attorney and others in the community for similar work.’”  (Bihun v. AT&T Information Systems, Inc. (1993) 13 Cal. App. 4th 976, 997 overruled on other grounds by Lakin v. Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 644, 664.)  The burden is on the party seeking attorney fees to prove reasonableness of the fees.  (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal. App. 4th 603, 615.) The Court has broad discretion in determining the amount of a reasonable attorney's fee award which will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal. App. 4th 1379, 1393-94.  The Court need not explain its calculation of the amount of attorney’s fees awarded in detail; identifying the factors considered in arriving at the amount will suffice. (Ventura v. ABM Industries Inc. (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-75.) II. AnalysisOn December 12, 2023, this court granted the County’s special motion to strike Plaintiff’s defamation cause of action. (See 12/12/23 Ruling.) There is no dispute that the County is the prevailing Defendant and is therefore entitled to recover attorney’s fees in connection with the successful special motion to strike. In total, the County seeks $79,959.15 as its reasonable attorney’s fees. A. Reasonable Hourly RateThe County seeks compensation for the work of attorneys Bernadette Bolan and Caitlin Jolley, who were “primarily responsible for preparing and filing the anti-SLAPP motion.” (Bernadette Decl. ¶ 11.) Attorney Bolan has “nearly 10 years of legal experience including extensive experience with anti-SLAPP motions and legal disputes involving government entities” and bills at a rate of $825 per hour. (Id. ¶ 12.) Attorney Jolley has “over four years of legal experience” and bills at a rate of $695 per hour. (Id. ¶ 13.) The County also notes that the firm has charged the County a discounted rate that is less than the firm’s standard rates because of the volume of business that the County provides the firm.  Notwithstanding, counsel argues it should recover based on its standard hourly rates. (See, e.g., Nemecek & Cole v. Horn, 208 Cal. App. 4th 641, 651–52 (2012) (prevailing party is entitled to fees based on reasonable hourly rates, even if the client was charged a lower discounted rate).Here, this court will award a blended rate for all services in this case at $700 per hour.  This is a reasonable rate based on the prevailing rates in the Los Angeles area, the complexity of the case, the quality of services provided, and the attorneys’ experience. See, e.g., Mikhaeilpoor v.BMW of North America (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 240 [Trial court has broad discretion to utilize a “blended hourly rate” for its lodestar analysis]B. Hours Reasonably IncurredThe County states it has “conservatively limited its request” to a total of 113.1 hours. (Bolan Decl. ¶¶ 15, 16.) This reflects the time incurred in connection with both the anti-SLAPP motion and the instant fee motion, all of which is recoverable.Plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing the fees sought are speculative and excessive based on the “straightforward” issues presented in the motion. The fee award “should ordinarily include compensation for all the hours reasonably spent, including those relating solely to the fee.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal. 4th 1122, 1133 [emphasis in the original].) A prevailing defendant on an anti-SLAPP motion is entitled to seek fees and costs incurred in connection with the anti-SLAPP motion itself, but is not entitled to an award of attorney's fees and costs incurred for the entire action. (Wanland v. Law Offices of Mastagni, Holstedt & Chiurazzi (2006) 141 Cal. App. 4th 15, 21.)This court agrees that the fee request—and corresponding billing records for nearly every task—appear unreasonable to a degree.  Indeed, the special motion to strike was directed toward only a single cause of action and a single defamatory statement. It did not involve any inherently complex or novel issues. For experienced attorneys billing at premium rates, “[s]uch a motion should not have been such a monumental undertaking.”  (Maughan v. Google Tech., Inc. (2006) 143 Cal. App. 4th 1242, 1251.)  [FN 1]Considering the totality of the circumstances—including the complexity of the motion, the quality of the work, and the motion’s success—the court finds that a total of 60 hours were reasonably expended relating to the anti-SLAPP motion and subsequent fee motion.  Accordingly, utilizing a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, this court finds and awards a total amount of $42,000.00 in attorney’s fees, calculated by multiplying $700/h x 60 hours.IT IS SO ORDERED.Dated:   June 13, 2024 ___________________________________ Randolph M. Hammock Judge of the Superior CourtFN 1-  Going forward, counsel should be mindful that a trial court has the discretion to deny a request for attorney’s fees altogether, even though it may be required by law, whenever the request for attorney’s fees is grossly excessive and/or shocks the conscience of the court.  “A fee request that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance permitting the trial court to reduce the award or deny one altogether.” (Chavez v. City of Los Angeles (2010) 47 Cal.4th 970, 990-991 [citing Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635; accord, Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1137].)  Requesting almost $80,000.00 in attorney’s fees in this particular situation appears to be coming closer to “shocking the conscience of the court,’ than it shouldn’t. Any party may submit on the tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept49@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day before the hearing.  All interested parties must be copied on the email.  It should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
