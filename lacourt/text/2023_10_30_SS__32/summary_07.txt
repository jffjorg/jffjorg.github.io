And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling in a civil case, case number 21STCV22144, regarding a demurrer to the answer filed by Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc. (Defendant). Plaintiff Eloy Alfaro (Plaintiff) seeks to test the legal sufficiency of Defendant's answer, arguing that each of Defendant's forty affirmative defenses fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a defense and is uncertain. The Court notes that the parties did not meet and confer before filing the demurrer, but this is not grounds to overrule or sustain the demurrer. The Court also declines to exercise its discretion to hear the untimely demurrer, as no explanation was provided for the delay and no court order extending the deadline was issued. Therefore, the demurrer to Defendant's answer is overruled.
