CASE NUMBER:


19STCV42599




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Compel Plaintiff’s Deposition




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant City of West Covina 




OPPOSING PARTY:


Unopposed 



 
BACKGROUND
 
On January 3, 2023, Defendant City
of West Covina (“Defendant”) moved to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Layla
Tafoya, by and through her guardian ad litem Ashley Esquivel (“Plaintiff”). On
September 26, 2023, the Court denied the motion because there was no proof of
service on Plaintiff of the rescheduling of the hearing date. Defendant
requested a continuance of the hearing so that Defendant could serve Plaintiff
with notice. The Court granted the request. On October 2, 2023, Defendant filed
a proof of service of notice that the motion was continued to October 30 so
that Plaintiff could oppose the motion, and attached the original moving
papers.
 
DISCUSSION
Code of Civil Procedure §
2025.450(a) provides, “If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the
action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a
person designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230,
without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear
for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent's attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  Code of Civil
Procedure § 2025.450 requires the Court to compel the deposition unless it
finds a valid objection was served under §2025.410. The objecting party has the
burden to justify objections asserted. (See Denari v. Superior Court
(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1488, 1494-95.) Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480,
subdivision (a) permits parties to bring a motion to compel the appearance of a
deponent that failed to answer any question or produce documents. Code of Civil
Procedure section 2025.610, subdivision (b) also permits a party to take a
further deposition of a person upon the order of the Court for “good cause
shown.” (McCoy v. Gustafson (2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 56, 97.)
 
 
Defendant served a deposition
notice to Plaintiff’s counsel on February 28, 2022. (Buchanan Dec.¶ 2.) On July
26, 2022, Defendant again noticed the deposition. (Id. ¶ 11.) Defendant
proceeded with the deposition on August 16, 2022 and obtained a certificate of
non-appearance. (Id. ¶ 15.) Accordingly, the Court grants the motion to compel
Plaintiff’s deposition.
 
Defendant also seeks monetary
sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel of record. However, counsel was
relieved prior to the hearing on the motion. It is unclear whether Plaintiff
has retained new counsel. The Court finds that the imposition of sanctions
would be unjust.
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
The Court therefore grants the motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition.
Plaintiff is ordered to appear for deposition within 30 days.
 
Defendant shall give notice of the Court’s order and file a proof of
service of such.
