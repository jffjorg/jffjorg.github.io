```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The Court found that it has fundamental jurisdiction over the subject matter and parties, and that the judgment is the result of the Court's failure to follow proper procedure, rather than a clerical mistake. The Court also noted that the error at issue does not appear to have been a clerical mistake in the judgment, but a ruling by the Court in the exercise of judgment. Therefore, the Court did not find that Section 473(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure applies. The Court ordered the plaintiffs to provide notice of this Order and file proof of service of such.
