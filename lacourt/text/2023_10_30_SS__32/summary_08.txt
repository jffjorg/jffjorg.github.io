Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Smarte Carte Corporation's demurrer to Plaintiff Artur Karapetyan's complaint. The judge found that the complaint is not uncertain and states a cause of action for negligence. The complaint alleges that Defendant's employee or agent collided a luggage cart into Plaintiff, causing him injury, while he was using the escalator at Tom Bradley International Terminal. The judge rejected Defendant's argument that the complaint fails to state a cause of action and is uncertain. Therefore, the judge overruled the demurrer and ordered Defendant to file a responsive pleading within 30 days.
