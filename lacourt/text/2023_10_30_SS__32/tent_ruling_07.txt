MOTION
 
On June 15, 2021, Plaintiffs Eloy Alfaro and Chris Northcross (Plaintiffs)
filed a complaint against Rasier LLC, Uber Technologies Inc., and Does 1 to 50
for negligence surrounding a motor vehicle accident. Plaintiffs did not serve
Defendant until June 23, 2023.
 
On August 18, 2023, Uber Technologies, Inc. (Defendant) filed an
answer where it issued a general denial of Plaintiffs’ allegations and asserted
forty affirmative defenses. 
 
Plaintiff Eloy Alfaro (Plaintiff) now demurs to Defendant’s answer arguing
that every affirmative defense: (1) fails to state facts sufficient to constitute
a defense and (2) is uncertain. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
A demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency
of other pleadings.  It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form
or content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or
cross-complaint).  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 422.10, 589; see Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  “A demurrer tests
the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.”  (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  It is sustained
only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially
noticeable.  (Code Civ. Pro., § 430.30.)  No extrinsic evidence may
be considered.  (See Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110
Cal.App.3d 868, 881.) 
 
A demurrer to an answer is
limited to three grounds:¿¿ 
¿ 
(a) The answer does not state
facts sufficient to constitute a defense;¿¿ 
(b) The answer is uncertain; or¿¿ 
(c) Where the answer pleads a
contract, it cannot be ascertained from the answer whether the contract is
written or oral.¿¿ 
¿ 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20.)¿  
 
The same pleading of “ultimate facts” rather than
evidentiary matter or legal conclusions is required as in pleading the
complaint. The effect of a general denial in an answer is to put in issue
the material allegations of the complaint. (Advantec Group, Inc. v. Edwin’s
Plumbing Co., Inc. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 621, 627.)   
 
In addition to denials, the answer should contain whatever
affirmative defenses or objections to the complaint that defendant may have,
and that would otherwise not be in issue under a simple denial.  Such affirmative
defenses or objections are “new matter” and must be specially pleaded. (Walsh v. West Valley Mission Community College Dist. (1998) 66
Cal.App.4th 1532, 1546; Code Civ. Proc. § 431.30(b).) Also, the answer must aver facts as carefully and with as
much detail as the facts which constitute the cause of action
and which are alleged in the complaint.  (FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashimi (1991)
231 Cal.App.3d 367, 384.)  The various affirmative defenses must be
separately stated and must refer to the causes of action to which they relate
“in a manner by which they may be intelligently distinguished.”  (Code
Civ. Proc. §431.30(g).)  In sum, California is a fact pleading
jurisdiction, not a notice pleading jurisdiction like the federal courts, such
that merely putting an opposing party on notice is not sufficient.  (Bach
v. County of Butte (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 554, 561; see Diodes, Inc. v.
Franzen (1968) 260 Cal.App.2d 244, 250.)   
 
The critical inquiry when a plaintiff demurs to an answer
is whether the answer raises a defense to plaintiff’s stated cause of action. 
(Timberidge Enterprises, Inc. v. City of Santa Rosa (1978) 86
Cal.App.3d 873, 879-880.) Demurrers to a complaint or an answer generally follow the
same rules; however, there are some important differences.  (South
Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 733.)   
 
First, for a demurrer to an answer, the defect in question
need not appear on the face of the answer.  (Id.)  “The
determination of the sufficiency of the answer requires an examination of the
complaint because its adequacy is with reference to the complaint it purports
to answer. [Citations.] This requirement, however, does not mean that the
allegations of the complaint, if denied, are to be taken as true, the rule
being that the demurrer to the answer admits all issuable facts pleaded therein
and eliminates all allegations of the complaint denied by the answer.
[Citations.]” (Id.)  Second, for purposes of a demurrer to an
answer, each defense in the answer must be considered separately without regard
to any other defense.  (Id. at 733-34.)  Thus, a separately
stated defense that is sufficient in form and substance when viewed in
isolation does not become insufficient when, on looking at the answer as a whole, that defense appears inconsistent with other parts of the
answer. (Id.)  Third, because a defendant is entitled to plead
inconsistent defenses, where one separate answer denies all of the
allegations of the plaintiff's complaint, the plaintiff is not excused from
making proof of the material facts because of admissions of some or all of them
found in other and separate answers of the defendant. (Id. at
734.)   
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this
chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.
(a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the
responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).)
Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a declaration detailing
their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(3).)
 
            Based
on the declaration by Plaintiff’s counsel, no meet and confer took place either
in person or by telephone. However, a failure to meet and confer is not grounds
to overrule or sustain a demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41 (a)(4).)
 
ANALYSIS
 
The Court notes that Defendant
filed and served its answer on August 18, 2023. Plaintiff filed the
demurrer on October 9, 2023. Under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.40(b), “[a]
party who has filed a complaint or cross-complaint may, within 10 days after service
of the answer to his pleading, demur to the answer.” Nevertheless, the trial
court has discretion to hear an untimely demurrer. “There is no absolute right
to have a pleading stricken for lack of timeliness in filing where no question
of jurisdiction is involved, and where, as here, the late filing was a mere
irregularity [citation]; the granting or denial of the motion is a matter which
lies within the discretion of the court.” (McAllister
v. County of Monterey (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 253, 281–282.) 
 
Plaintiff offered no explanation for the untimeliness of this
demurrer, or evidence that the deadline to respond was extended by stipulation.
There is also no Court order extending the deadline. The complaint was filed in
June 2021 but not served until more than two years later. Defendant also asserts
that the instant motion was not served on Defendants. (Braus Dec. ¶ 13.) Defendants
further assert that they intend to move for an order compelling arbitration.
 
The Court declines to exercise its discretion to hear the untimely
demurrer.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the demurrer to Defendant’s answer is overruled. 
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
