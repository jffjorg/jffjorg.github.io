MOTION
 
On September 19, 2022, Plaintiff Artur Karapetyan (Plaintiff) filed a
complaint against Defendants Command Security, City of Los Angeles, and Does 1
to 100 for general negligence. 
 
On August 24, 2023, Plaintiff added Defendant Smarte Carte Corporation
(Defendant) as Doe 1. Defendant now demurs to the complaint on the basis that it
fails to state facts that constitute a cause of action and is uncertain.
Plaintiff opposes and Defendant replies. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
The primary function of a pleading is to give the other party notice
so that it may prepare its case [citation], and a defect in a pleading that
otherwise properly notifies a party cannot be said to affect substantial
rights.” (Harris v. City of Santa Monica (2013) 56 Cal.4th 203, 240.) “A demurrer tests the
legal sufficiency of the factual allegations in a complaint.” (Ivanoff v.
Bank of America, N.A. (2017)
9 Cal.App.5th 719, 725.) It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form
or content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or
cross-complaint).  (Code Civ. Proc. §§
422.10, 589; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th
968, 994.)  It is not the function of the
demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of
the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to
be true.  (Donabedian, 116
Cal.App.4th at 994.)
 
A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the
face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that
are judicially noticeable.  (Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th
at 994.)  No other extrinsic evidence can
be considered.  (Ion Equip. Corp. v.
Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court to consider facts
asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States
Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other
grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d
287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court record].)
 
A demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is
incomplete or discloses some defense that would bar recovery.  (Guardian North Bay, Inc. v. Superior
Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-72.) 
A general demurrer may be brought where the dates alleged in the
complaint show the cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations.
(See Saliter v. Pierce Bros. Mortuaries (1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 292, 300.) 
 
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this
chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.
(a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the
responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).)
Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a declaration detailing
their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(3).)
 
Defendant’s declaration states the parties met and conferred by email.
(Sawyer Decl. ¶ 4.)  Therefore, the
requirement is not met because they did not confer by telephone or in-person.
However, “[a] determination by the court that the meet and confer process was
insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 430.41 (a)(4).) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
The
elements of a cause of action for negligence are: (1) a duty on the part of
defendant toward plaintiff; (2) defendant’s breach of that duty; and (3) harm
to the plaintiff caused by that breach. (Kesner v. Superior Court (2016)
1 Cal.5th 1132, 1142.) 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10(f) provides that a
pleading is uncertain if it is ambiguous and unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 430.10(f).) “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a
complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified
under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) “A demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained
only where the complaint is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably
respond—i.e., he or she cannot reasonably determine what issues must be
admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed against him or her.”
(Weil & Brown, Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group) § 7:85
(emphasis in original).) “The objection of uncertainty does not go to the
failure to allege sufficient facts.” (Brea v. McGlashan (1934) 3
Cal.App.2d 454, 459.)  “It goes to the doubt as to what the pleader means
by the facts alleged.” (Id.) “Such a demurrer should not be sustained
where the allegations of the complaint are sufficiently clear to apprise the
defendant of the issues which he is to meet.” (People v. Lim (1941) 18
Cal.2d 872, 882.)        
 
Here,
the Complaint is not uncertain because it states sufficient facts to apprise
the Defendant on the issues and basic facts of the action. The Complaint
alleges: 
 
“On
or about August 04, 2021, Plaintiff was at the Tom Bradley International
Terminal which is owned, operated, and controlled by Defendant, City of Los
Angeles. At that time and place, Plaintiff was using said Defendant's
escalator, as Plaintiff neared the bottom of the escalator that leads down to
the TSA checkpoint, Defendants, and each of their, employee and/or agent, while
in the course and scope of his employment and/or agency for said Defendants,
negligently, carelessly, wrongfully, and recklessly collided a luggage cart
that he was operating into Plaintiff. As a result of said employee's actions, Plaintiff
was knocked over said cart, causing him to fall and sustain physical injury.” 
(Complaint,
5.)
 
The
word “Defendants” can be reasonably attributed to Smarte Carte Corporation since
it has been added as a Defendant. Therefore, based on the allegations,
Plaintiff has alleged that Defendant’s employee or agent, in the scope of
employment, negligently collided a luggage cart into Plaintiff, causing him
injury. As a result, enough facts are pled to constitute a cause of action for negligence.
Additionally, the allegations are not so ambiguous and unclear to warrant
sustaining on the basis of uncertainty. 
 
Therefore,
Defendant’s demurrer on the basis of uncertainty and failure to state a cause
of action is overruled. 
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court overrules Defendant Smarte Carte Corporation’s demurrer
to Plaintiff’s complaint. Defendant shall file a responsive pleading within 30
days.
 
Defendant Smarte Carte Corporation shall provide notice of the Court’s
ruling and file a proof of service of such.
