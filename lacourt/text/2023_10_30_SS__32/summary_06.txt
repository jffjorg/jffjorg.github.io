Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion filed by Defendant Courtney Tight to file a cross-complaint against Plaintiff Grigor Karakhanyan. The cross-complaint seeks indemnity, apportionment of fault/contribution, and declaratory relief. The judge notes that the cross-complaint is compulsory, as it arises out of the same transaction as the cause of action in Plaintiff's cross-complaint. The judge also finds that Defendant's delay in seeking leave to file the cross-complaint, which is over 21 months, is not sufficient to deny the motion, as there is no evidence of bad faith. The judge grants the motion and orders Defendant to file and serve the proposed cross-complaint within 10 days.
