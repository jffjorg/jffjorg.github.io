And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is on a motion filed by the Plaintiff's counsel, Nina Sargsyan, of Downtown LA Law Group, to be relieved as counsel for the Plaintiff, Miriam Carolina Lopez Monroy. The motion states that the Plaintiff no longer responds to counsel's attempts at communication, does not follow advice or suggestions, and the level of trust necessary to continue representation no longer exists. The Court finds that there is a valid reason for the withdrawal, but notes that the proposed order contains errors regarding the manner of service. The Court orders Counsel to file an amended form MC-053 and serve it within 10 days of the date of the order. The motion is conditionally granted pending Counsel's filing and service of the updated form, and Counsel will remain the attorney of record for Plaintiff until the updated proposed order is filed and served.
