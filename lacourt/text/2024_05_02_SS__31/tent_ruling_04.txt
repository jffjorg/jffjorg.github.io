BACKGROUND Plaintiff Jade Carrasco, by and through her Guardian Ad Litem Jesse Ronald Carrasco, (“Plaintiff Carrasco”) moves to compel defendant Ariana Arambula (“Arambula”) to appear for her deposition.  Arambula is in pro per. As of April 19, 2024, no opposition has been filed.  II. MOTION TO COMPEL DEPOSITION The Court is unable to proceed on the merits of this motion due to a procedural deficiency. Plaintiff Carrasco’s counsel declares that he made telephonic attempts regarding Arambula’s availability to schedule the deposition, and after no dates were provided, Plaintiff Carrasco unilaterally set the deposition for January 12, 2024. After no appearance by or for Arambula, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a “fourth attempt” letter on January 16, 2024 requesting that the deposition be conducted within the next 35 days.  A motion to compel deposition “shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.” (CCP § 2025.450(b)(2).) Here, Plaintiff’s counsel’s letter to Arambula, and to the other pro per defendants at the same address, does not make any reference to the January 12, 2024 nonappearance. (Mot. Exh. 4.) Instead, the letter is identical to the prior letters Plaintiff’s counsel mailed, which requests generally that all the pro per defendants contact Plaintiff’s counsel to provide availability dates. The Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to submit a meet and confer declaration to inquire about the nonappearance within the express meaning of CCP § 2025.450(b)(2).   III. CONCLUSION The motion is therefore denied. The denial is without prejudice as to Plaintiff Carrasco re-filing the motion with the required meet and confer declaration.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 1st day of May 2024      Hon.
