BACKGROUND  On July 30, 2020, plaintiffs Jacob McGee (“McGee”) and Zhontile Reddick (“Reddick”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action against defendant Julien Brunet (“Defendant”) and Does 1-15 for damages arising from a motor vehicle accident.  Defendant now moves for terminating sanctions against Plaintiffs for failing to serve verified discovery responses in compliance with the Court’s February 7, 2024 Order pertaining to Defendant’s motions to compel discovery responses.  Plaintiffs are in pro per. Defendant filed a corrected proof of service evincing service upon Plaintiffs at the addresses provided by their former counsel. (Proof of Service, March 22, 2024.) As of April 19, 2024, no opposition has been filed.   II. MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS Legal Standard Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030 gives the court the discretion to impose sanctions against anyone engaging in a misuse of the discovery process.  A court may impose terminating sanctions by striking pleadings of the party engaged in misuse of discovery or entering default judgment.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030(d).)  “[T]the trial court has broad discretion in selecting the appropriate sanction, and we must uphold the trial court's determination absent an abuse of discretion.”  (Dept. of Forestry & Fire Protection v. Howell (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 154, 191, overturned on other grounds in Presbyterian Camp & Conference Centers, Inc. v. Superior Court (2021) 12 Cal.5th 493, 516 n. 17.)   A violation of a discovery order is sufficient for the imposition of terminating sanctions.  (Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620.)  Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in disobeying the court's orders.  (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 795-796.)   A terminating sanction is a "drastic measure which should be employed with caution."  (Deyo, 84 Cal.App.3d at 793.)  "A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction."  (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.)  While the court has discretion to impose terminating sanctions, these sanctions "should be appropriate to the dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery."  (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at 793.)  "[A] court is empowered to apply the ultimate sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with his discovery obligations."  (Ibid.)  Discovery sanctions are not to be imposed for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure of discovery to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of information.  (See Midwife v. Bernal (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 57, 64 [superseded on other grounds as stated in Kohan v. Cohan (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 967, 971].)  Discussion & Conclusion Defendant asserts he served set one of form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents on Plaintiffs on November 28, 2022. Plaintiffs have been in propria since the Court granted Plaintiffs’ counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel on February 2, 2023. (Min. Order, Feb. 2, 2023.) On February 7, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s unopposed motions to compel, and ordered Plaintiffs to serve verified responses to the form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and RPDs, without objections, within thirty days. (Min. Order, Feb. 7, 2024.) The Court also imposed monetary sanctions against Plaintiffs. (Ibid.) Defendant argues that, to date, Plaintiffs have failed to comply with the Court’s order by failing to serve responses and by failing to pay sanctions.  Here, there is no evidence that Plaintiffs served responses to the outstanding discovery in compliance with this Court’s February 7, 2024 Order, or responded in any other manner as a result of the ruling. Ever since Plaintiffs’ counsel had been relieved, Plaintiffs have made no appearances at any of the subsequent hearings. Further, Plaintiffs do not oppose this motion and appear to have abandoned the case. Therefore, the Court concludes Plaintiffs knew of their discovery obligations, knew of the Court Order compelling their compliance, and failed to demonstrate their non-compliance was not willful. Given Plaintiffs’ failure to comply with discovery obligations, failure to participate in litigation, and apparent disinterest in prosecuting this action, the Court finds lesser sanctions would not curb the abuse.    Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions is therefore GRANTED. Plaintiffs’ action against Defendant is hereby dismissed.   Moving party is ordered to give notice.   PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 1st day of May 2024      Hon. Michelle C. Kim Judge of the Superior Court
