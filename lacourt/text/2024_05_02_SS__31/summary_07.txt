And here is the English text to summarize the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying without prejudice the motion to relieve Counsel as attorney of record. The motion was filed by Counsel, Raymond Ghennezian, Esq., who contends that a complete breakdown in the attorney-client relationship necessitates relief. Counsel claims that a dispute has arisen regarding Counsel's ability to proceed as attorney of record, and that the issues in question are fundamental and crucial to the outcome of the case. However, the proof of service contains errors, including the failure to provide an electronic address for Plaintiff. The Court finds that the proof of service is defective and denies the motion without prejudice. The moving party is ordered to give notice. Parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and those who intend to submit on this tentative ruling must send an email to the court.
