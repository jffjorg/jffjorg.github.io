The Tentative Ruling grants the Defendants' motions to compel discovery responses from the Plaintiff, Martha Melgar. The Plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests, despite being properly served. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's objections to the service of the discovery requests are without merit. The Plaintiff's counsel does not deny that service upon Mr. Kasler was proper and does not provide any legal authority to support their contentions. The Court orders the Plaintiff to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 20 days. The Court also imposes sanctions on the Plaintiff in the amount of $652, which includes $572 in sanctions and $80 in costs.
