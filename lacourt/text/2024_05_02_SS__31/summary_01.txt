Here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively granted the defendant's unopposed motion for terminating sanctions against the plaintiffs, Jacob McGee and Zhontile Reddick, for their failure to comply with discovery orders. The plaintiffs have been in pro per since their former counsel was relieved on February 2, 2023. The defendant served discovery requests on November 28, 2022, and the court ordered the plaintiffs to serve verified responses by February 7, 2024. The plaintiffs failed to comply with the order, and the court has found that lesser sanctions would not curb the abuse. The court has granted the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions and dismissed the plaintiffs' action against the defendant.
