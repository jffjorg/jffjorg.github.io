```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the Defendant's motion to compel the Plaintiff's deposition. The Plaintiff failed to appear for his deposition, and his counsel failed to communicate with him. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's counsel's inability to reach the Plaintiff does not constitute a valid objection to a properly served deposition notice. The Plaintiff's failure to communicate with his counsel does not justify sanctions. The Court awards the Defendant's counsel $250 for the motion, and the Court Reporter's certificate of nonappearance for $426.80. The Court also imposes sanctions on the Plaintiff in the amount of $736.80. The Plaintiff is ordered to pay the sanctions within 20 days.
