And here is the English text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the City of Los Angeles' motion for summary judgment in a case involving a slip and fall accident. The plaintiff, Lisa Steinmetz, alleges that the City of Los Angeles allowed a continuous stream of water to flow into the street, causing the water to pool and creating a slippery surface, which led to her accident. The City of Los Angeles argues that it does not own, maintain, or control the property where the accident occurred and therefore had no duty to prevent the accident from occurring. The judge has denied the City of Los Angeles' motion for summary judgment, finding that the City has failed to meet its initial burden of production and that the case should proceed to trial. The judge has also ordered the parties to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement on the issues in the case.
