  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees and
  costs (code civ. proc., § 1281.99(a))
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Tennia Taylor
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant CitiGuard Inc.
Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.99)
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Tennia Taylor (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order
awarding attorney’s fees and costs in her favor and against defendant
CitiGuard, Inc. (“Defendant”) in the total amount of $59,258, consisting of
attorney’s fees in the amount of $59,138 and costs in the amount of $120.[1]

First, the court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to recover attorney’s
fees from Defendant that she incurred as a result of Defendant’s breach of the
parties’ arbitration agreement. 
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction against a drafting party
that materially breaches an arbitration agreement pursuant to subdivision (a)
of Section 1281.97 or subdivision (a) of Section 1281.98, by ordering the
drafting party to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees and
costs, incurred by the employee or consumer as a result of the material
breach.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.99,
subd. (a).) 
On November 17, 2023, the court issued an order (1) finding that
Plaintiff met her burden to establish that Defendant materially breached the
parties’ arbitration agreement by failing to pay the fees required to commence
arbitration, such that Defendant was in default of the arbitration agreement
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.97, and (2) granting
Plaintiff’s motion to vacate the order compelling the parties to submit to
binding arbitration pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.97.  (Nov. 17, 2023 Order, pp. 3:6-9, 4:19-24.)  Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff is
entitled to recover from Defendant attorney’s fees and costs that she incurred
as a result of Defendant’s breach.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1281.99, subd. (a).) 
Second, the court finds that Plaintiff may recover only the attorney’s
fees and costs that she has established that she incurred as a result of
Defendant’s breach, and therefore may not recover all attorney’s fees and costs
that she incurred to commence and prosecute this action. 
As set forth above, the court shall impose a monetary sanction against
a drafting party that has materially breached the arbitration agreement by
ordering the drafting party to pay “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees and costs, incurred by the employee or consumer as a result
of the material breach.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1281.99, subd. (a) [emphasis added].) 
The court has reviewed the billing statements submitted by Plaintiff’s
attorneys, and finds that Plaintiff has not established, based on adequate
argument, analysis, and evidence, that Plaintiff’s incurring attorney’s fees
and costs to oppose the motion to compel arbitration were incurred as a result
of Defendant’s breach of the arbitration agreement.  (Appendix, Ex. 1, Roven Timesheet, p. 1;
Appendix, Ex. 2, Crippen Timesheet, p. 1; Appendix, Ex. 3, Gomez Timesheet, p.
1.) 
Third, the court finds that Plaintiff has established a lodestar
figure, as to the attorney’s fees that she incurred as a result of Defendant’s
breach of the arbitration agreement, of $8,685.
“[T]he fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the
‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate. . . . .¿ The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing
in the community for similar work.¿ The lodestar figure may then be adjusted,
based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee
at the fair market value for the legal services provided.”¿ (PLCM Group v.
Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 (internal citations omitted).)¿ “[T]he
verified time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are
entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are
erroneous.”¿ (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State Univ.
(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396.)¿¿ 
Plaintiff has submitted the declarations of attorneys Jonathan Roven,
Britanie Crippen, and Annelyse Gomez, in which they have attested to their
qualifications, education, and experience. 
(Roven Decl., ¶¶ 2-20; Crippen Decl., ¶¶ 2-9; Gomez Decl., ¶¶ 2-8.)  The court finds that (1) a reasonable hourly
rate for attorney Roven is $600, (2) a reasonable hourly rate for attorney
Crippen is $350, and (3) a reasonable hourly rate for attorney Gomez is
$325.  (Ibid.)  
The court further finds that (1) attorney Roven has reasonably expended
10.5 hours as a result of Defendant’s breach of the arbitration agreement,
consisting of the time expended (i) to draft the motion to vacate the order
compelling arbitration and supporting documents (4.5 hours), (ii) to discuss
the arbitration payment with counsel (0.5 hours), and (iii) to prepare the
pending fee motion (5.5 hours); (2) attorney Crippen has reasonably expended 5.7
hours as a result of Defendant’s breach of the arbitration agreement,
consisting of the time expended (i) to review correspondence regarding the
arbitration payment (0.2 hours), (ii) to review documents filed in connection
with the motion to vacate the order compelling arbitration (3 hours), and (iii)
to prepare the pending fee motion (2 hours); and (3) attorney Gomez has
reasonably expended 1.20 hours as a result of Defendant’s breach of the
arbitration agreement, consisting of the time expended (i) to draft the motion
to vacate the order compelling arbitration (1 hour), and (ii) to review the
email discussion with opposing counsel regarding the payment of arbitration
fees (0.2 hours).  (Appendix, Ex. 1,
Roven Timesheet, pp. 1-2; Appendix, Ex. 2, Crippen Timesheet, pp. 1-2; Appendix,
Ex. 3, Gomez Timesheet, p. 1.) 
The court therefore finds that Plaintiff has established a lodestar
figure of $8,685 ((10.5 hours x Roven’s $600 hourly rate) + (5.7 hours x
attorney Crippen’s $350 hourly rate) + (1.20 hours x attorney Gomez’s $325
hourly rate)).  The court finds that
Plaintiff has not shown that the court should award a 1.5 multiplier.  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1132 [setting forth factors that justify a multiplier].) 
The court finds that Plaintiff has not supported her request for costs
in the amount of $120 (e.g., by stating that costs were incurred in that amount
in the declaration of counsel) and therefore denies Plaintiff’s request for
costs. 
ORDER
            The court grants in part plaintiff
Tennia Taylor’s motion for attorney’s fees and costs as follows. 
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1281.99, the court orders that plaintiff Tennia Taylor shall recover
from defendant CitiGuard, Inc. attorney’s fees in the amount of $8,685.
            The court orders plaintiff Tennia
Taylor to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
