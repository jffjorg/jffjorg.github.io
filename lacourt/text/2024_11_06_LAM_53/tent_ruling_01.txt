  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion to compel further
  responses to requests for production of documents
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant City of Beverly Hills
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of
Documents
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.[1]
 No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Defendant City of Beverly Hills (“Defendant”) moves the court for an
order (1) compelling plaintiff Aria Sonora Silva-Espinosa (“Plaintiff”) to
serve further responses to Defendants’ Requests for Production of Documents,
Set One, numbers 1-30, and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of
Defendant and against Plaintiff in the amount of $4,635.90.
 
The court denies Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s further
response to Requests for Production of Documents, number 1 because that demand does
not adequately designate the documents, tangible things, and electronically
stored information to be copied by specifically describing each individual item
or reasonably particularizing each category of item as required.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.030, subd. (c)(1).)  
The court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 2-13, 15-27, and 30 because
the objections in the responses to those demands are without merit.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(3).) 
The court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to
Request for Production of Documents, numbers 14 and 28 because Plaintiff did
not serve responses to those demands. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) 
The court denies Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s further
response to Requests for Production of Documents, number 29 because that demand
is unintelligible and does not identify where in the operative complaint that Plaintiff
makes the alleged contention. 
            The court grants Defendant’s request
for monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).)  The court
finds that $3,537 ((10 hours x $297 hourly rate) + (1.4 hours x $405 hourly
rate)) is a reasonable amount of sanctions to impose against Plaintiff in
connection with this motion.  (Smith
Decl., ¶ 13.) 
ORDER
            The court grants in part defendant
City of Beverly Hills’s motion to compel further responses as follows. 
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.310, the court orders plaintiff Aria Sonora Silva-Espinosa (1) to
serve on defendant City of Beverly Hills further written responses that comply
with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2031.210-2031.250 to defendant City of
Beverly Hills’s Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 2-13, 15-27, and
30, and (2) to produce to defendant City of Beverly Hills all documents and
things in plaintiff Aria Sonora Silva-Espinosa’s possession, custody, or
control, which are responsive to those requests, within 20 days of the date of
service of this order. 
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.300, the court orders plaintiff Aria Sonora Silva-Espinosa (1) to
serve on defendant City of Beverly Hills full and compete verified responses,
without objections, and which comply with Code of Civil Procedure sections
2031.210-2031.250, to defendant City of Beverly Hills’s Requests for Production
of Documents, numbers 14 and 28, and (2) to produce to defendant City of
Beverly Hills all documents and things in plaintiff Aria Sonora
Silva-Espinosa’s possession, custody, or control, which are responsive to those
requests, within 20 days of the date of service of this order. 
The court orders plaintiff Aria Sonora Silva-Espinosa to pay monetary
sanctions to defendant City of Beverly Hills in the amount of $3,537 within 30
days of the date of service of this order. 
            The court orders defendant City of
Beverly Hills to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
