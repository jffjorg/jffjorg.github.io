And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents. The defendant, City of Beverly Hills, had requested that the court compel the plaintiff, Aria Sonora Silva-Espinosa, to serve further responses to certain requests for production of documents, as well as awarding monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,635.90.

The court denied the defendant's motion to compel further responses to request number 1, as the demand did not adequately designate the documents to be copied. The court granted the defendant's motion to compel further responses to requests numbers 2-13, 15-27, and 30, as the objections in the responses to those demands were without merit. The court also granted the defendant's motion to compel plaintiff's responses to requests numbers 14 and 28, as plaintiff did not serve responses to those demands.

The court granted the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,537, which is a reasonable amount considering the time and effort spent by the defendant's attorney on this motion.

The court orders the plaintiff to serve further written responses to the defendant's requests for production of documents, numbers 2-13, 15-27, and 30, and to produce all responsive documents and things within 20 days of the date of service of this order. The court also orders the plaintiff to serve full and complete verified responses to requests numbers 14 and 28, and to produce all responsive documents and things within 20 days of the date of service of this order.

The court orders the plaintiff to pay monetary sanctions to the defendant in the amount of $3,537 within 30 days of the date of service of this order.
