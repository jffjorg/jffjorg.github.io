And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding the upcoming hearing on the motion to deem requests for admission admitted and the motion to compel responses to requests for production of documents. The court notes that the proof of service for the discovery served on the defendant states that it was served by mail, but an attached email shows that it was actually served by email. The court also notes that the proof of service states that the discovery was served on April 23, 2024, but the email shows that it was served on April 22, 2024. The court is considering these discrepancies as it prepares for the hearing.
