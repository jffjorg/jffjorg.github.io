[1] On
July 29, 2024, the court issued an order (1) advancing the hearing on the
motion to deem requests for admission admitted from February 18, 2025 to
November 6, 2024, and (2) advancing the hearing on the motion to compel
responses to requests for production of documents, set two, from April 15, 2025
to November 6, 2024.  (July 29, 2024 Order,
¶¶ 4-5.)  Plaintiff Kristin Davidkhanian
gave notice of the court’s order to counsel for the defendants on July 31,
2024.  (Aug. 23, 2024 Notice of Hearing
and Order, pp. 2, 4 [proof of service].) 


[2]
The court notes that, although counsel for Plaintiff has stated, in his
declaration, that service of this discovery was by email, the proof of service
states that the discovery was served by mail. 
(Banayan Decl., ¶ 6; Banayan Decl., Ex. F, p. 6:16-19 [stating service
was effected by mail].) 


[3]
The court notes that the proof of service states that the discovery was served
on April 23, 2024.  (Banayan Decl., Ex.
1, p. 6:6-7.)  However, Plaintiff has
attached a copy of the email, which appears to show that Plaintiff served this discovery
on Defendant on April 22, 2024.  (Banayan
Decl., Ex. 2, p. 2.)
