  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to compel further
  responses to requests for production of documents and for sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Blanca Salgado         
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Kia America, Inc. 
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of
Documents and for Sanctions
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Blanca Salgado (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order
(1) compelling defendant Kia America, Inc. (“Defendant”) to serve further
responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 1-16,
18, 19-32, 33-36, 37-41, 44, and 45-46, and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in
favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $2,310.
            As a threshold matter, the court
notes that, in its opposition papers, Defendant asserts that it served Plaintiff
with supplemental responses to demand numbers 1-16, 19-34, and 44 on May 14,
2024.  (Cleveland Decl., ¶ 13; Cleveland
Decl., Ex. C [Supp. Responses to Requests for Production Nos. 1-16, 19-34, and
44].)  In reply, Plaintiff appears to
have withdrawn the motion as to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers
1-16, 19-32, and 44 because (1) Plaintiff did not request that the court
exercise its discretion to rule on the motion as to Defendant’s supplemental
responses to those demands, and (2) Plaintiff’s reply papers do not request an
order compelling Defendant’s further responses to those document demands.  (Reply, pp. 1:6-7 [arguing that demand
numbers 18, 33-36, 37-41 and 45-46 seek relevant and discoverable information],
5:8-11 [“Plaintiff respectfully requests that Plaintiff’s Motion be granted in
full and Defendant be ordered to serve verified supplemental responses to RFPs
18, 33-36, 37-41 and 45-46 without objections and to produce all responsive
documents, and to pay sanctions as requested above”].)  
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff’s motion is moot as to Requests
for Production of Documents numbers 1-16, 19-32, and 44, and therefore rules on
the merits of Plaintiff’s motion as to numbers 18, 33-41 and 45-46.  The court exercises its discretion to
consider Defendant’s supplemental responses to Requests for Production of
Documents numbers 33 and 34.  (Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 409 [“Whether a particular response does resolve
satisfactorily the issues raised by a motion is a matter best determined by the
trial court in the exercise of its discretion, based on the circumstances of
the case”].) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 18 and 33-41 because
the objections in the responses to those demands are without merit.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(3).) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
response to Requests for Production of Documents, number 45, limited to any
customer complaints regarding the defects alleged in the Complaint for vehicles
purchased in California that are the same year, make, and model as the subject
vehicle. 
The court denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
response to Requests for Production of Documents, number 46 because that demand
(1) is overbroad since it calls for the production of documents that are
neither relevant to the subject matter in the pending action nor reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, and (2) is unduly
burdensome.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2017.010.) 
In light of the circumstances presented, including Defendant’s service
of supplemental responses to Plaintiff and the mixed result of the court’s
ruling on this motion, the court finds that the imposition of sanctions would
be unjust and therefore denies all requests for monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).) 
ORDER
            The court grants in part plaintiff
Blanca Salgado’s motion to compel further responses and for sanctions as
follows. 
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.310, the court orders defendant Kia America, Inc. (1) to serve on
plaintiff Blanca Salgado further written responses that comply with Code of
Civil Procedure sections 2031.210-2031.250 to plaintiff Blanca Salgado’s
Requests for Production of Documents (i) numbers 18 and 33-41 and (ii) number
45, limited to any customer complaints regarding the defects alleged in the
Complaint for vehicles purchased in California that are the same year, make,
and model as the subject vehicle, and (2) to produce to plaintiff Blanca
Salgado all documents and things in defendant Kia America, Inc.’s possession,
custody, or control which are responsive to those requests (and limited as set
forth above) within 20 days of the date of this order. 
            The court denies all requests for
sanctions.
            The court orders plaintiff Blanca
Salgado to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
