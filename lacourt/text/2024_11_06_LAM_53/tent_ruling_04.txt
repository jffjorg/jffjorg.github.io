The court notes that, in reply, Plaintiff requests an award of attorney’s fees in
the total amount of $108,255.  (Reply, p.
10:17-20.)  However, that is not the
relief that Plaintiff requested in her notice of motion.  (First Amended Notice of Mot., p. 2:6-7
[requesting $59,138 in attorney’s fees and $120 in costs].)  The court does not consider the request for
additional attorney’s fees made in reply.
