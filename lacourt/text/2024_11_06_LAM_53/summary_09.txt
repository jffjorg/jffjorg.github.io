And here is a summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Plaintiff Blanca Salgado, seeking to compel Defendant Kia Motors America to provide further responses to certain requests for production of documents and awarding sanctions. The Court has granted the motion in part, compelling Defendant to provide further responses to certain requests and producing all responsive documents. The Court has also denied Plaintiff's request for sanctions. The ruling was based on the Court's review of the parties' filings and the laws governing discovery in California. The Court noted that Defendant had provided supplemental responses to some of the requests, but that the objections to certain requests were without merit. The Court also found that one of the requests was overbroad and unduly burdensome.
