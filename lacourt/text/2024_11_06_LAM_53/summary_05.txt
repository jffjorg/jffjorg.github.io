```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by defendant Houman Vosoghi, M.D. ("Defendant") and has denied the motion as to both the first cause of action for negligence and the fifth cause of action for elder abuse.

As to the first cause of action, the court finds that Defendant has not met his burden to show that the claim fails, in its entirety, since he did not address both theories on which Plaintiff bases this claim. Specifically, Defendant did not address the allegations that he failed to obtain informed consent for surgery and did not provide proper follow-up treatment.

As to the fifth cause of action, the court finds that Defendant has not met his burden to show that the claim has no merit. Defendant argued that his conduct was not reckless, oppressive, malicious, or fraudulent, but failed to present authority establishing that these elements are required to recover damages for physical elder abuse under the Elder Abuse Act. Additionally, Defendant did not address the allegations that he engaged in physical elder abuse and failed to provide goods or services necessary to avoid harm or mental suffering.

The court therefore denies Defendant's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication as to both causes of action and orders Plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
