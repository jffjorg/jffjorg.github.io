[1] Respondents
request the court to take judicial notice of (1) Senate Bill 98, California
2020 Legislative Service Chapter 24 (RJN Ex.1); (2) Senate Bill 820, California
2020 Legislative Service Chapter 110 (RJN Ex.2); and (3) Assembly Bill 181, California
2022 Legislative Service Chapter 52 (RJN Ex.3).  All three exhibits are judicially noticed.  Evid. Code §452(b).

For ease of reference, the court will refer to CDE and not the Superintendent.

CDE adds
that New Village relies on the School Directory Details available on the CDE
website despite the website’s disclaimer that the information “is voluntarily
self-reported by local educational agencies (LEAs) to the CDE as a public
convenience” and “should not be relied upon for any purpose and should be used
only to contact the LEA.”  Ex. B, p.
22.  The Charter Schools in California
Counties lists also do not dictate whether a charter school is
nonclassroom-based for funding purposes. 
Park Decl., ¶4; Heredia Decl., ¶7; Ex. B, p. 22.  The county directory is based on a charter
school’s self-reported information.  The
“pink” designation is only for those schools that are fully or predominantly
nonclassroom-based, and those schools not shaded pink may still be offering
independent study instruction which exceeds 20% in some years, making the
school nonclassroom based for those fiscal years under section 47612.5.  Park Decl., ¶4.  Opp. at 6.


[4] CDE suggests that
New Village has admitted that it was properly classified as a
nonclassroom-based charter school because it sought and received a nonclassroom
based funding determination from the SBE for fiscal years 2021-22 through
2022-23.  Park Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. 1.  In making this funding request, New Village recognized
that it needed a funding determination as a nonclassroom based charter school
to receive funding if it provided less than 80% of instruction offered at the
schoolsite pursuant to sections 47612.5(d)(3) and 47634.2, and Title 5
California Code of Regulations sections 11963 through 11963.6.   Opp. at 7.
New
Village rebuts this argument.  It filed a
request for funding determination in February 2022 at the behest of CDE, which
urged all charter schools to file at the beginning of the school year due to
the uncertainty of how the COVID-10 pandemic would affect student
attendance.  Quiñones Decl., ¶¶ 2-7, Ex. A; JSF ¶¶ 17-24, Exs. D, E, G-I.   New Village made this request solely as a precaution
against loss of funding if it had significant nonclassroom instruction as the
campus reopened, and it was based entirely on estimates since actual attendance
figures for P-2 were not reported until four months later.  Quiñones Decl., ¶5.  After New Village certified its 2021-22 P-2
ADA numbers in late June 2022, it made clear to CDE that it was a
classroom-based charter school entitled to Supplemental Funding.  Ibid.

Likewise,
LAUSD may have “notified” New Village regarding nonclassroom-based instruction
(JSF 16, Ex. G), but LAUSD does not make classifications or computations for
funding determination requests or pursuant to the relevant statutes; CDE
does.  In fact, LAUSD requires
classroom-based charter schools later classified as nonclassroom-based to make
a material revision to their charter, which has never been required of New
Village.  Quiñones Decl., ¶¶ 8-11.  Reply at 5.


[5] The parties do
not address section 46303(b), which provides: “Whenever a reference is made to
a specific whole number of units of average daily attendance said number shall
include any fraction above said number which is less than one-half a unit, and
any fraction of one-half or more above a unit above the next lowest whole
number.”  §46303(b).  It is unclear what this provision means or
when it applies.


[6] New
Village argues that it is immaterial
when the necessary rounding should occur. 
Whether the reported ADAs are
rounded before or after division, or both, New Village’s percent of instruction
time offered at the school site was at least 80%.  Pet. Op. Br. at 12, n.2.


[7]  CDE’s
calculation highlights how it is disproportionately influenced by New Village’s
nonclassroom-based ADA, which rounds up because (at 11.51) it is just barely
above 11.49.  In short, CDE’s proposed
method compounds the rounding differential.
