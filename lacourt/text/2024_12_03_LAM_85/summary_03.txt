As for the English text summary, the judge's tentative ruling is as follows:

The court has read and considered the moving papers and renders the following tentative decision. The plaintiff, Junius J. Joyner, seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent the defendants from conducting a lien sale or otherwise disposing of his vehicle. The plaintiff alleges that his vehicle was improperly towed by Nathans, a towing company, without proper notice or authorization. The plaintiff also alleges that Nathans failed to comply with statutory requirements of Vehicle Code section 22658.

The court finds that the plaintiff has not properly served Nathans, the defendant, and therefore cannot address the merits of the claim. The application for a preliminary injunction will be denied or continued for the plaintiff to make proper service on Nathans.
