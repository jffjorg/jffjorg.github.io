Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in YAML format:

```
Case Number: 23STCP04590
Hearing Date: December 3, 2024
Dept: 85

Plaintiff: New Village Charter School
Defendant: California Department of Education and Tony Thurmond, Superintendent of Public Instruction

Disputes:
  - Classification of New Village Charter School as a nonclassroom-based charter school
  - Eligibility for Supplemental Funding
  - Calculation of Average Daily Attendance (ADA)

Facts:
  - New Village Charter School is a non-profit high school chartered by LAUSD since 2006
  - New Village provides a full-day, classroom-based curriculum at its campus in the Rampart neighborhood of Los Angeles
  - New Village has always certified as a "Classroom-based" school in the PADC system
  - New Village's ADA for the 2021-22 fiscal year was 45.68 (classroom-based) and 11.51 (nonclassroom-based)

Intentions:
  - New Village seeks a declaration that its classification as a nonclassroom-based charter school is erroneous
  - New Village seeks a writ of mandate commanding Respondents to lawfully determine its eligibility to receive Supplemental Funding

Laws:
  - Education Code section 42238.023(b)(3)
  - Education Code section 47612.5
  - Education Code section 46301
  - Education Code section 46303(a)
  - AB 181, section 123(a)(2)

Significant Statements:
  - Respondents have calculated that New Village's classroom-based ADA for the 2021-22 fiscal year was 79.87% (45.68/57.19)
  - New Village argues that this calculation is incorrect because it should be rounded to the nearest whole number
  - Respondents contend that they do not compute ADA and that the reported ADA is used as reported
```

The judge's tentative ruling grants the petition for mandamus and orders Respondents to lawfully determine New Village's eligibility to receive Supplemental Funding. The ruling finds that Respondents' calculation of New Village's classroom-based ADA is incorrect and that the school's actual ADA was at least 80%, making it eligible for Supplemental Funding. The ruling also finds that Respondents failed to comply with the Education Code by not rounding the ADA figures to the nearest whole number.
