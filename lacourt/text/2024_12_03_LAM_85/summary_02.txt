And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a request by the California Department of Education (CDE) to take judicial notice of three California legislative bills: Senate Bill 98, Senate Bill 820, and Assembly Bill 181. The CDE is seeking to classify a charter school, New Village, as a nonclassroom-based charter school and is disputing New Village's claim that it is a classroom-based charter school entitled to supplemental funding.

The judge notes that CDE's calculation of New Village's Average Daily Attendance (ADA) is influenced by New Village's nonclassroom-based ADA, which rounds up because it is just barely above 11.49. The CDE's calculation compounds the rounding differential, which could disproportionately affect New Village's funding.

New Village argues that it is immaterial when the necessary rounding should occur, and that whether the reported ADAs are rounded before or after division, or both, its percent of instruction time offered at the school site was at least 80%.

The judge also notes that CDE's notification of New Village regarding nonclassroom-based instruction is not relevant, as LAUSD (Los Angeles Unified School District) does not make classifications or computations for funding determination requests or pursuant to the relevant statutes; CDE does.

The judge concludes that the parties do not address section 46303(b), which provides that whenever a reference is made to a specific whole number of units of average daily attendance, it shall include any fraction above said number which is less than one-half a unit, and any fraction of one-half or more above a unit above the next lowest whole number. The judge is unclear what this provision means or when it applies.
