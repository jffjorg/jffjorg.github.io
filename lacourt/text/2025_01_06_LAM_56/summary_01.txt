And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion to quash a deposition subpoena filed by the plaintiff, Erika Pinheiro, and has denied the motion. The plaintiff is seeking to quash a deposition subpoena issued to Magnit Global, her current employer, which seeks a wide range of documents and information related to her employment records. The defendants argue that the records are discoverable, relevant, and admissible because they would speak to the plaintiff's performance and ability to work. The judge finds that the records are relevant to the litigation and that the defendants have a compelling need for them. The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendants and their attorneys. The motion to quash is denied, and the parties are ordered to give notice of the ruling.
