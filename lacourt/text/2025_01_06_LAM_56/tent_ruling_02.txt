RESPONDING PARTY: None.

 
            The Court has considered the moving papers.
No opposition has been filed. 
 
BACKGROUND
             On July 20, 2023, Plaintiff Timothy Settles (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint (the “Complaint”) against Defendant and Does 1 through 5. On September
16, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative first amended complaint (“FAC”)
alleging causes of action for: (1) general negligence; (2) intentional tort;
(3) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (4) undue mental anguish; and
(5) defamation of character.
 
            On October 17, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, demurrer, to Plaintiff’s
FAC (the “Demurrer”) and concurrently filed a motion to strike (“the Motion to
Strike”) as well. The Demurrer and Motion to Strike are unopposed. 
 
MEET AND CONFER 
            Defendant
has satisfied the meet and confer requirement. 
 
DEMURRER
A demurrer for
sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”)
§ 430.10, subd. (e).) 
 
To sufficiently
allege a cause of action, a complaint must allege all the ultimate facts—that
is, the facts needed to establish each element of the cause of action pleaded.
(Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983)
35 Cal.3d 197, 212, superseded by statute as stated in Branick v. Downey
Savings & Loan Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) “[E]ach evidentiary
fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be
alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53
Cal.4th 861, 872.) 
 
In testing the
sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all
material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) Courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other grounds, Jones v. Lodge at
Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) A demurrer,
however, “does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or
law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.)  
 
            Defendant
first moves to dismiss the FAC on the grounds that it was not timely filed and
was never served on Defendant. (Demurrer, pp. 4:23-5:6) Defendant also demurs to
the entire FAC on the grounds that it is uncertain and does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action. (Demurrer, pp. 6:3-7:28) Upon
review of the FAC, the Court finds that while Plaintiff states the facts underlying
his claim, he fails to allege the essential elements required to establish any
of his asserted causes of action against Defendant. In addition, there is no
proof of service indicating that the FAC was properly served upon Defendant. 
 
Thus, because Plaintiff
has failed to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, the Demurrer
is SUSTAINED in its entirety, with leave to amend.
 
MOTION TO STRIKE
            The court may, upon a motion or at
any time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (a) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (b) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP § 436, subds.
(a), (b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a
pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are
surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)
 
            Because the Court has sustained the
Demurrer in its entirety, the Motion to Strike is moot. 
 
            Defendant’s Demurrer to the FAC is
SUSTAINED, with thirty days leave to amend. The Motion to Strike is MOOT.  
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
