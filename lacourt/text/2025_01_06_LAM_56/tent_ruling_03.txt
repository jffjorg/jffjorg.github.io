 Case Number:  24STCV14063    Hearing Date:   January 6, 2025    Dept:  56 .            
 
TIMELINESS
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP)
section 1005 subdivision (b), “all moving and supporting papers shall be served
and filed at least 16 court days before the hearing” plus two calendar days for
service electronic service. Accordingly, Plaintiff was required to serve the
instant Motion by December 9, 2024. Instead, Plaintiff served the Motion on
Defendant on December 12, 2024, which is untimely. The Court therefore DENIES
the Motion without prejudice. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
Dated this 6th day of January 2025
