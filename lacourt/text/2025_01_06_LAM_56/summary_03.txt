And here is the English-text summary:

The judge, Hon. Holly J. Fujie, has issued a tentative ruling denying a motion filed by the plaintiff. The motion was filed late, as it was served on December 12, 2024, instead of the required date of December 9, 2024. The judge is relying on California Code of Civil Procedure section 1005 subdivision (b), which requires motions to be served and filed at least 16 court days before the hearing, plus two calendar days for electronic service. The motion is denied without prejudice, meaning the plaintiff can re-file the motion at a later date. The parties are required to notify the court of any disagreement with the tentative ruling and may submit written comments via email. If no comments are received and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be removed from the calendar.
