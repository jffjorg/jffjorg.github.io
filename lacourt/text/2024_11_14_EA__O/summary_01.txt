And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motions of Elvis Tran and Bin Li to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiff, Wendy Lin, in both cases 22PSCV00580 and 22STCV31621. The court finds that the attorney-client relationship has broken down and that there is little to no prejudice in granting the motion. The parties' next appearance is a case management conference in May 2025, which is not a substantive motion requiring immediate representation. The court's ruling is effective upon service of the motions and the court's orders upon the plaintiff, defendant, and all other parties who have appeared.
