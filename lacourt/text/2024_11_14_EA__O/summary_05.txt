And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled that the Defendant's demurrer (a request to dismiss the complaint) is sustained, meaning that the complaint is dismissed, but with leave to amend. This means that the Plaintiff can re-file the complaint, addressing the issues raised by the Defendant. The Judge's ruling is based on the fact that the Plaintiff has not addressed the cases of Bryant v. Glastetter and Dyer v. Sup. Ct., which are relevant to the issue of whether the Defendant owes a duty of care to tow truck operators. The Judge has determined that the Plaintiff's claims fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and that the Plaintiff has not provided an analysis of the Rowland factors, which are used to determine whether a duty of care exists.
