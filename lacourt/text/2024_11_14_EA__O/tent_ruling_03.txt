Background
 
This is a contracts case. Plaintiff Wendy Lin (“Wendy” or
“Plaintiff”) alleges that she and Defendant Bo Sun (“Bo” or “Defendant”) formed
TOPTREE INVESTMENT LLC (“Toptree”) with the purpose of jointly purchasing a
property in Chino Hills (the “property”). Plaintiff paid the entire purchase
price, but Bo has failed to pay his $50,000 capital contribution such that by
the terms of the Operating Agreement, Bo has lost his entire membership
interest in the company. (See generally First Amended Complaint (FAC).)[1]

 
On June 14,
2023, Plaintiff filed her verified third amended complaint (TAC).
 
On January
19, 2024, Defendant Bo Sun filed his first amended cross-complaint (1ACC).
 
On June 13,
2024, Plaintiff Wendy Lin filed her answer to the 1ACC.
 
On October 3,
2024, the court issued the following ruling regarding the motion: The motion to
quash filed by Wendy Lin on 06/03/2024 is granted in part/denied in part: the
motion is quashed as to Wendy's personal finances, but Wendy is to produce
documents as to the financial records of all corporations by 11/04/2024.
 
On October
23, 2024, a motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Wendy Lin was filed
by Bin Li, which was rejected by the court clerk for the failure to provide the
attorney’s information.
 
On October
24, 2024, another motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff was filed,
this time by Elvis Tran.
 
Discussion
 
Counsels
Elvis Tran and Bin Li seek to be relieved as Plaintiff’s attorney in BOTH
actions (the lead case and the related case) due to a break down in the
attorney-client relationship. According to the MC-052 form, Plaintiff has not
responded to text messages or calls. As for prejudice, there are no substantive
motions on calendar that require immediate representation and the parties’ next
appearance (aside from this hearing) is a CMC and post-mediation status
conference set for May 2025. Thus, as Plaintiff has not filed an opposition
despite being served with the motion, the court finds little to no prejudice by
granting the motion. (Defendant Bo Sun has been served with notice of the
motions.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, the four motions are granted, effective upon service of motions and the court’s orders upon
Plaintiff, Defendant, and all other parties who have appeared.
