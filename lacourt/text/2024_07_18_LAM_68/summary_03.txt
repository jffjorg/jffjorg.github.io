And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Topa Insurance Company and Hippo Analytics, Inc., have moved to strike certain allegations in the complaint as arising from protected activity. The plaintiffs, Faramarz and Mojgan Massachi, have opposed the motion, arguing that the allegations are not integral to the claim and that the defendants lack a probability of prevailing on the claim.

After reviewing the evidence, the court finds that the defendants have failed to shift the burden to demonstrate that the allegations in the complaint arise from protected activity. The court also finds that the defendants' conduct was not privileged and that the allegations in the complaint are not integral to the claim.

Therefore, the court denies the defendants' motion to strike the complaint in its entirety. The court also finds that the litigation privilege is inapplicable to the case and that the defendants' conduct was not protected by the litigation privilege.

Finally, the court orders that any counter motion for attorney fees by the plaintiffs must be filed in a separate noticed motion. The court also schedules a demurrer to the complaint for July 23, 2024.
