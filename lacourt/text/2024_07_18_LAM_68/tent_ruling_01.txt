Motion
to Reopen Discovery
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
January 2, 2019, plaintiff Sascha Lynch was involved in an automobile collision
with defendant Gerson Jacton Moreno (Defendant) on the northbound 110 Freeway
in Los Angeles. On December 15, 2020, Plaintiff filed a complaint against for
motor vehicle negligence. 
 
On
January 18, 2024, the court vacated the March 25, 2024, trial date. On February
21, 2024, the court dismissed the case at the request of Plaintiff Sascha Lynch
without prejudice. The court also retained jurisdiction to make orders to
enforce any and all terms of settlement pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 664.6.
 
RULING: Moot/Off-Calendar.
Request
for Judicial Notice: Denied.
Plaintiff Sascha Lynch moves for the court to reopen
discovery in order for Plaintiff to verify the accuracy of the responses to
discovery from respondent, defendant Gerson Jacton Moreno aka Gerson Jacton
Moreno Garcia.
 
The
entire action was dismissed on February 21, 2024. While the motion was filed
after the dismissal, the court finds nothing in the motion supporting a basis
for relief given the dismissal of the entire action, or even a threshold
argument for an arguable enforcement of the settlement agreement. The court
declines to address the extensive arguments in the motion, opposition, and
reply given the lack of address of the dismissal itself under Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6
 
The
motion is therefore moot and taken off-calendar.
 
Plaintiff
to provide notice.
