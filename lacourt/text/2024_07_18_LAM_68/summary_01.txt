And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling by the judge states that the motion to reopen discovery filed by the plaintiff, Sascha Lynch, is moot and taken off-calendar. The judge declines to address the extensive arguments in the motion, opposition, and reply because the plaintiff failed to address the dismissal of the entire case on February 21, 2024, under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The court finds that the dismissal of the case renders the motion to reopen discovery unnecessary and without merit.
