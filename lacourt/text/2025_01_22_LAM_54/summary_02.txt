And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court, presided over by Judge Maurice A. Leiter, has issued a tentative ruling on the petitions for minor's compromise filed by the minor claimants, Lataysha Cosie, et al. The petitioners seek court approval for a settlement agreement with defendants 861 42nd, LLC and Behzad Beroukhai, under which the minor claimants would receive $10,000.00 each out of a total settlement of $1,350,000.00. The settlement funds will be delivered to the minor's parents.

The Court finds that the individual settlements are fair in light of the alleged injuries sustained by the claimants. The Court notes that section 372 of the California Code of Civil Procedure and California Rules of Court Rules 7.950 and 7.952 govern compromises of disputed claims brought by minors, and that a petition for court approval of a compromise must be verified by the petitioner and contain a full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise or covenant.

The Court grants the petitions for minor's compromise and approves the settlement agreement. The parties have until 8:00 am on the day of the hearing to submit any objections to the tentative ruling.
