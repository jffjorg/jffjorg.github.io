And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motion for reconsideration filed by Plaintiff Marbely Villalobos regarding the earlier order compelling arbitration. The Court initially granted the motion to compel arbitration based on the controlling authority of Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486. However, the Second District later decided In re Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, which contradicts Felisilda. Plaintiff's counsel filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that the Court has jurisdiction to reconsider the order compelling arbitration. The Court agrees that it has jurisdiction, but denies the motion as untimely, as it was not filed within the 10-day period required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. The Court orders Plaintiff's counsel to provide notice and file proof of such with the Court.

Therefore, the motion for reconsideration is denied, and the plaintiff's counsel must provide notice and file proof of such with the court.

English text:
Judge Marbely Villalobos issued a tentative ruling on September 20, 2023, regarding Plaintiff Marbely Villalobos' motion for reconsideration of the Court's order compelling arbitration against Defendant Nissan North America, Inc. The case was originally filed under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.

The Court has jurisdiction to reconsider an order compelling arbitration, but the motion for reconsideration is denied as untimely. Per Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, the motion must be filed ten (10) days after entry of the Court's order compelling arbitration. Plaintiff's counsel did not file the motion ten (10) days after the Second District's decision in Ochoa v. Ford Motor Company.

The decision in Felisilda v. FCA US LLC was controlling authority at the time the motion to compel arbitration was granted, but it has since been contradicted by the decision in In re Ford Motor Warranty Cases.

Plaintiff's counsel is required to provide notice and file proof of such with the Court.
