And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of an order compelling arbitration. The plaintiff, Marbely Villalobos, filed the motion against Nissan North America, Inc., after the Second District's decision in In re Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, which contradicts the previous decision in Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486. The judge notes that the Court has jurisdiction to reconsider an order compelling arbitration, but denies the motion as untimely, citing Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, which requires the motion to be filed within 10 days of the order compelling arbitration. The judge orders the plaintiff's counsel to provide notice and file proof of the denial with the Court.
