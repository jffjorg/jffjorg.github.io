 Case Number:  22STCV26056    Hearing Date:   September 20, 2023    Dept:  39 Marbely Villalobos
v. Nissan North America, Inc.
Case No.
22STCV26056
Motion for
Reconsideration
 
            Plaintiff
Marbely Villalobos (“Plaintiff”) filed this case under the Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act against Defendant Nissan North America, Inc. (“Defendant”).  Defendant filed a motion to compel
arbitration, which the Court granted on February 2, 2023, per Felisilda v. FCA
US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486.  At the
time, Felisilda was controlling authority, and this Court was required to
follow its holding.  Then, on April 4,
2023, the Second District decided In re Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89
Cal.App.5th 1324, which contradicts Felisilda. 
Plaintiff’s counsel filed a motion for reconsideration on May 25,
2023.    
 
            Contrary to
Defendant’s argument, the Court has jurisdiction to reconsider an order
compelling arbitration.  (See Malek v.
Blue Cross of California (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 44, 59-60.)  Nevertheless, the Court denies the motion as
untimely.  Per Code of Civil Procedure
section 1008, the motion for reconsideration must be filed ten (10) days after
entry of the Court’s order compelling arbitration.  Plaintiff’s counsel did not even file this
motion ten (10) days after the Second District’s decision in Ochoa v. Ford
Motor Company. 
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration is denied.  Plaintiff’s counsel shall provide notice and
file proof of such with the Court.
