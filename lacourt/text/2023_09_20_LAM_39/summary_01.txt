English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to quash service of summons and complaint as it relates to ZCTT and continues the motion as it relates to CTT. The court also orders jurisdictional discovery on the sole and narrow issue of whether CTT maintained an office in Long Beach, California during the operative time period. The ruling states that the court lacks general jurisdiction over CTT because it is a Chinese company with no connections to California, and that specific jurisdiction is also lacking because the alleged defamatory statements were made in China, not California. The court notes that mere injury to a forum resident is not a sufficient connection to the forum, and that a single communication, such as an email, from defendants in China to a forum resident is not sufficient to confer jurisdiction.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge has ruled that the motion to quash service of summons and complaint filed by the defendants (CTT and ZCTT) will be granted as it relates to ZCTT. The motion will be continued as it relates to CTT.

The judge has also granted jurisdictional discovery on the narrow issue of whether CTT maintained an office in Long Beach, California, as purported on its website.

The judge has determined that there is no general jurisdiction within the State of California, as CTT does not have sufficient contacts with the state. The judge has also determined that there is no specific jurisdiction within the State of California, as the alleged defamatory publications by CTT to Torrid did not occur in California.

The judge has ordered that the motion will be continued to a later date, and that defendants' counsel shall provide notice and file proof of service with the court.

Case Citations: N/A

Statutes: N/A

Roles:

* Plaintiff: the party that filed the case
* Defendants: the party that is being sued

Significant Statements:

* “Personal jurisdiction may be either general or specific. A nonresident defendant may be subject to the general jurisdiction of the forum if his or her contacts in the forum state are substantial, continuous and systematic. In such a case, it is not necessary that the specific cause of action alleged be connected with the defendant's business relationship to the forum. Such a defendant's contacts with the forum are so wide-ranging that they take the place of physical presence in the forum as a basis for jurisdiction.”
* “Even if a nonresident defendant does not have sufficient contacts with California such that the defendant is subject to suit in California generally, the defendant may nonetheless be subject to jurisdiction in California for claims based on the defendant’s activities in the state. To assert “limited” or “specific” personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant, the plaintiff must demonstrate that: (a) the out-of-state defendant purposefully established contacts with the forum state; (b) the plaintiff's cause of action “arises out of” or is “related to” defendant's contacts with the forum state; and (c) the forum’s exercise of personal jurisdiction in the particular case comports with “fair play and substantial justice.””

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to quash as it relates to ZCTT is granted, the motion is continued as it relates to CTT, and following service upon CTT, the Court shall permit jurisdictional discovery on the sole and narrow issue whether CTT maintained an office in Long Beach, California during the operative time period. The motion is continued to a future date, and Defendants' counsel shall provide notice and file proof of such with the Court. The ruling is based on the fact that there appears to be no general jurisdiction within the State of California, and Plaintiff has not demonstrated that the exercise of specific jurisdiction would be reasonable. The only concern is Defendant’s purported office in California, and the Court grants jurisdictional discovery on the narrow issue whether CTT maintained an office in Long Beach, California, as purported on the website.
