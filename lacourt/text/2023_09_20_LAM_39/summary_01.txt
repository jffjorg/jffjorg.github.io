English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to quash service of summons and complaint as it relates to ZCTT and continues the motion as it relates to CTT. The court also orders jurisdictional discovery on the sole and narrow issue of whether CTT maintained an office in Long Beach, California during the operative time period. The ruling states that the court lacks general jurisdiction over CTT because it is a Chinese company with no connections to California, and that specific jurisdiction is also lacking because the alleged defamatory statements were made in China, not California. The court notes that mere injury to a forum resident is not a sufficient connection to the forum, and that a single communication, such as an email, from defendants in China to a forum resident is not sufficient to confer jurisdiction.
