And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petitions for compromise of minors claims filed by Nathanial Norton and Noah Norton. Unfortunately, the petitions lack clarity regarding the total amount offered, breakdown of settlement costs and fees, and the identity of Jake Lane, who is unclearly referred to as potentially being the same person as Jacob Norton or Robert Jacob Norton. The court is also concerned about its jurisdiction over the nominal defendant, Noah Norton, and whether he has been served and appeared in the case. Without his written agreement, the court is unwilling to approve the compromise, as this could expose the minors to a potential future claim by the nominal defendant. The court is requesting clarification on these issues and may consider serving and defaulting the nominal defendant if no agreement is reached. The case is scheduled for a hearing on January 24, 2024.
