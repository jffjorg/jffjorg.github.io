And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has reviewed the two petitions for compromise of minors' claims, but finds them lacking in clarity. The total amount offered in the cases is not specified, and there is no breakdown of the settlement, costs, and fees. The court is also unsure about the identity of Jake Lane, and whether he is the same person as Jacob Norton or Robert Jacob Norton. The judge is concerned about the court's jurisdiction over the nominal defendant and whether he has been served and appeared. Without the nominal defendant's written agreement, the minors may be exposed to future claims. The court is unwilling to approve the petitions without this agreement, and suggests that the nominal defendant could be served and defaulted instead. The judge has requested clarification on these issues and will consider the petitions further at the hearing on January 24, 2024.
