The Defendant had moved to compel arbitration and stay the action, and the Plaintiffs, Sassan Simhai and Eden Water Conservation Inc., had filed a notice of non-opposition. The Court found that the Purchase Order Agreement, entered on June 21, 2022, included an arbitration provision requiring arbitration of disputes arising from the relationship between the Plaintiff and Defendant. As the burden shifted to the Plaintiffs with the submission of the arbitration agreement, the Court found no dispute as to the relief requested and granted the motion. An arbitration status conference has been set for January 30, 2025, at 8:30 a.m., and mandatory appearance is required unless the case is dismissed or judgment entered.
