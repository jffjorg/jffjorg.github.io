 Case Number:  23VECV04458    Hearing Date:   January 24, 2024    Dept:  T 22VECV04458
and 23VECV04451
Nathanial Norton
and Noah Norton
 
The court
has reviewed the two petitions for compromise of minors claims.  There is a significant lack of clarity in
these petitions.
 
What is the
total amount offered altogether in both cases?
Why is there
no single settlement breakdown? (i.e., total amount of settlement, total amount
of costs, total amount of fees, etc.)
Who is Jake
Lane”  Is this person the same as Jacob
Norton or Jake Norton?  Is this the same
person as Robert Jacob Norton?  Why is
this not clearly stated?
Does the
court have jurisdiction over the nominal defendant (has he been served? has he
appeared?)
If the
nominal defendant does not sign the release, then it exposes the minors to a
claim later by the nominal defendant.  The court is presently unwilling to approve
without the nominal defendant’s written agreement.  Alternatively, the nominal defendant could
have been served and defaulted.  
Is this a
policy limits case?
