And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling states that the demurrer filed by the defendants, Bing Crosby Bautista and Josefina Bautista, is overruled. The court finds that the plaintiff, National Asian American Coalition (NAAC), has sufficiently alleged a breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and deceit. The court finds that the defendants' arguments that the plaintiff's claims are insufficient are without merit. The court notes that the plaintiff has alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the NAAC and that the NAAC has been harmed by each of them engaging in the conduct described in the amount to be determined at trial. The court orders the defendants to file their answers to the complaint within 20 days.
