And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's petition to vacate the arbitral award dismissing the complaint. The Judge found that the arbitrator did not exceed his authority under the arbitration agreement, which allowed for the employment ADR plan to be applied. The arbitrator was acting within his authority to hold that the CORE ADR plan was controlled. The Judge also noted that the plaintiff's reliance on California Union Square L.P. v. Saks & Company LLC is misguided, as the arbitrator was acting within his authority in that case as well.
