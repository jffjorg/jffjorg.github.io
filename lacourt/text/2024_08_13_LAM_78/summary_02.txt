Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions: (1) a motion to quash a deposition subpoena, and (2) a motion for an OSC re: contempt against HMP. The motion to quash is granted in part, as Del Sol has not established the relevance of records between HMP and MFHP, a non-party entity. The Judge also denies Del Sol's motion for an OSC re: contempt, as the party has not demonstrated willful disobedience.
