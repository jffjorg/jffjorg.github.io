The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's demurrer and motion to strike the complaint. The plaintiff, Lisa Acrond, and Margie Armstead, filed a complaint against Hyundai Motor America for breach of warranty related to the purchase of a 2012 Hyundai Elantra. The complaint was initially compelled to arbitration but was subsequently denied. The matter was remanded to the superior court for further proceedings. The defendant filed the demurrer and motion to strike nearly ten months after the matter was remanded. The Judge declines to exercise discretion to consider the untimely demurrer and motion to strike, citing the lack of explanation for the defendant's delay. The Judge finds that the demurrer and motion to strike are moot on grounds of untimeliness.
