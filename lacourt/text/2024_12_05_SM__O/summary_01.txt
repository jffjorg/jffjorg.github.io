  - "A defendant may satisfy this burden by showing that the claim 'cannot be established' because of the lack of evidence on some essential element of the claim."
  - "Once the defendant meets this burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a 'triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or defense thereto.'"
  - "The rule that a trial court must liberally construe the evidence submitted in opposition to a summary judgment motion applies in ruling on both the admissibility of expert testimony and its sufficiency to create a triable issue of fact."
```

Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment on the 2nd and 3rd causes of action for negligence and nuisance. The defendant failed to meet its burden to show that the plaintiffs cannot establish an element of their claims or that the defendant has shown undisputed facts that support each element of an affirmative defense. The plaintiffs showed that there are disputed material facts regarding the alleged habitability conditions in Unit #3 and the HOA's insurance coverage. The judge also found that the HOA did not have the minimum insurance amount to cover the tort claims, which makes the defendant liable for the causes of action. The case will proceed to trial.
