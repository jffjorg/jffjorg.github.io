Here is a brief summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Moving Defendants in the case of Anne Hawley and William Hawley vs. Timothy Burkhart, Timothy Dofflow, Jeffrey D. Hudgins, and Justin Miyahira. The demurrer was filed in response to the plaintiffs' complaint, which alleges that the defendants were negligent in their design and operation of the X2 rollercoaster at Six Flags Magic Mountain. The court has ruled that the demurrer is overruled, meaning that the plaintiffs' complaint will stand and the defendants will have to respond to the allegations.

The motion to strike was filed by the defendants, seeking to strike references to punitive damages from the plaintiffs' complaint. The court has denied this motion, finding that the plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to support their claims for punitive damages.

The court has also found that the defendants have failed to meet their burden of showing that the plaintiffs' claims are frivolous or lacking in merit. As a result, the court has denied the defendants' motion to strike and has allowed the plaintiffs' complaint to stand.
