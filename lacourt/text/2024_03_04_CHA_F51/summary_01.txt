And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling in favor of the Plaintiffs' motion to compel the deposition of Defendant's Person(s) Most Knowledgeable (PMK) and Custodian of Records. The Judge finds that the Plaintiffs have shown good cause to depose the PMK and Custodian of Records because their knowledge of the repair history and engine cut-off and transmission concerns is relevant to determining whether Defendant should have repurchased the vehicle. The Judge also finds that Defendant failed to respond to the deposition notice and has not opposed the motion.

As a result, the Judge orders the deposition of the PMK to be taken on or before April 4, 2024, with production of the requested documents. The Judge also imposes monetary sanctions of $525.00 against Defendant and/or its counsel.
