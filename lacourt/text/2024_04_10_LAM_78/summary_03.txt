And here is a summary in English:

The case is a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants, Parkwest Bicycle Casino, LLC, and Monument Properties-Bell Gardens, LLC. The defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiff's claims, ABG Holdings-Bell Gardens, LLC, for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and declaratory relief. The court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on all three claims.

The dispute arose from a lease agreement between the parties, which was terminated by Parkwest Bicycle Casino, LLC. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants breached the lease agreement and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The defendants argued that they had the contractual right to terminate the lease agreement and that there was no joint venture agreement between the parties.

The court held that the defendants met their burden of showing that there was no triable issue of material fact remained as to the existence of a joint venture agreement. The court also held that the plaintiff failed to meet its burden of showing a triable issue of material fact remained as to the breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on all three claims.
