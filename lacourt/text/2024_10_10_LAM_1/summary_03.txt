And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Plaintiffs' unopposed motion for change of venue is denied without prejudice. The Plaintiffs had sought to transfer the case from the Glendale Courthouse to the Compton Courthouse, citing that the defendant Kia of Cerritos has its principal place of business in Compton and the repair work on the subject vehicle and the agreement for services took place in Compton. However, the Court finds that the case was filed in the proper county under both CCP §§ 395 and 395.5, and that the Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a transfer is warranted. The Court notes that the Plaintiffs' counsel's declaration was void of any facts showing the necessity of a transfer, and that the Plaintiffs have not met their burden to warrant a district transfer.
