DA SILVA MCGLEW vs FATAMEH SHAMIE
Defendant’s Unopposed Motion to Relate Cases
TENTATIVE RULING: 
The Shamie Defendants’ Motion to Relate Cases is DENIED.  Counsel for the Shamie Defendants to give
notice to all parties in all three cases.
Standard 
 
In the event that the pertinent judge under California
Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1) does not relate any of the cases set forth in
a Notice of Related Case, Department 1 may relate the matters on noticed
motion. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(h)(1)(D); LASC Local Rules, rule 3.3(f)(3).) 
 
The Court Finds the Cases are Not Related
 
Cases are related when they (1)
involve the same parties and are based on the same or similar claims, (2) arise
from the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events
requiring the determination of the same or substantially identical questions of
law or fact, (3) involve claims against, title to, possession of, or damages to
the same property, or (4) are likely for other reasons to require substantial
duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges. (Cal. R. Ct.,
rule 3.300(a).) 
 
The Shamie Defendants contend the
cases are related based upon the second and fourth grounds enumerated in Rule
3.300(a). 
 
The motion to relate cases filed by
the Shamie Defendants is premised, in part, on Plaintiff’s deposition testimony
in 20STCV48002. (Stepanyan Decl. ¶ 6; Ex. F.) Plaintiff testified at deposition
that the accident giving rise to 21STCV16214 caused him increased pain.
(Stepanyan Decl. ¶ 6; Ex. F at p. 42:24-43:8.) Plaintiff testified that the
accident giving rise to 20STCV48002 caused all his injuries, the accident
giving rise to 20STCV48811 was mild, and the accident giving rise to
21STCV16214 enhanced all his injuries sustained in the accident giving rise to
20STCV48002. (Stepanyan Decl., ¶ 6; Ex. F at p. 44:11-25.) 
 
As demonstrated above, while each case
involves a claim for negligence based upon an automobile collision, they do not
involve the same parties. Each case involves a different defendant. (Cal. R.
Ct., rule 3.300(a)(1).) The cases also do not involve claims against, title to,
possession of, or damages to the same property within the meaning of Rule
3.300(a)(3). Each case involves separate automobile accidents that occurred on
different dates at different locations. 
 
The Shamie Defendants argue that the
three separate cases, which stem from three separate car accidents, “all raise
substantially identical questions of law and fact regarding the extent of his
injuries and the causation thereof.” (Motion at p. 8:9-11.) The Court does not
find that the actions arise from the same or substantially identical
transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or
substantially identical questions of law or fact. (California Rules of Court,
rule 3.300(a)(2).) Here, there are three separate automobile accidents, which
Plaintiff alleges caused various degrees of injury to his person. While the
source and extent of Plaintiff’s injuries are relevant to all three actions,
the Court does not find that “the actions arise from the same or substantially
identical transactions, incidents, or events.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.300(a)(2).) 
 
Next, the Shamie Defendants assert
that “hearing these cases separately would result in substantial duplication of
judicial resources.” (Motion at p. 8:21-22.) The Shamie Defendants also argue
that “separate adjudications could lead to inconsistent findings regarding the
causation and extent of McGlew’s injuries.” (Motion at p. 8:16-17.) 
 
The Court disagrees.  Thes cases involve separate automobile
accidents.  It will be necessary for the
parties to prove causation and damages (or lack thereof) with respect to each
incident whether the cases are related and consolidated or not.   
 
The Court finds 20STCV48002, 20STCV48811,
and 21STCV16214 are not related within the meaning of California Rules of
Court, rule 3.300(a) and the motion is DENIED.
