And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to transfer and coordinate the De La Cerda Action with the Santander Action. The motion was brought by De La Cerda, who alleges that Defendant failed to reimburse him for business expenses in violation of Labor Code ยง 2802. The De La Cerda Action is a representative PAGA claim, while the Santander Action is a representative action complaint alleging various wage and hour violations.

The judge found that the actions are not complex, but did not involve predominating and significant common questions of law and fact. The judge also found that the convenience of the parties, witnesses, and counsel weighed in favor of coordination, but that the disadvantages of duplicative and inconsistent rulings, orders, or judgments weighed in favor of transfer and consolidation.

The judge also considered the likelihood of settlement of the actions without further litigation, and found that coordination could inhibit the settlement reached in the Santander Action. Therefore, the judge denied the motion and allowed the two cases to remain separate.
