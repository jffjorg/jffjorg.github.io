The judge has denied the plaintiffs' unopposed motion for a change of venue, which sought to transfer the case from the Glendale Courthouse to the Stanley Mosk Courthouse. The judge found that the case was properly filed in the Glendale Courthouse and that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a need for a transfer. The judge also granted judicial notice of the complaint and corporate statements of information filed by the defendants. The judge noted that the plaintiffs' declaration failed to provide any factual evidence to support the need for a transfer and that the plaintiffs did not meet their burden to warrant a district transfer.
