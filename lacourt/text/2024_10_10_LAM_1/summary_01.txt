And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Shamie Defendants' motion to relate cases. The Court has denied the motion, finding that the three cases (20STCV48002, 20STCV48811, and 21STCV16214) are not related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a). The cases involve separate automobile accidents, each causing different degrees of injury to the Plaintiff. The Court finds that the cases require separate adjudications and that hearing them separately will not result in substantial duplication of judicial resources. The Shamie Defendants had argued that the cases are related based on the Plaintiff's deposition testimony and that consolidating the cases would reduce the need for duplicative evidence and help to prevent inconsistent findings. However, the Court disagrees, finding that the cases are distinct and require separate evaluation of the evidence.
