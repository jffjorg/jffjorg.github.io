Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court grants the Defendant's unopposed motion to transfer the case to the North District of the Los Angeles Superior Court. The case was originally filed in the Central District, but the Defendant argues that it was improperly assigned due to an error in the filing process. The Plaintiff agrees that the case was filed in the wrong district and does not oppose the transfer. The Court finds that the proper filing location for the action is the Michael D. Antonovich Antelope Valley Courthouse in the North District, and therefore grants the motion to transfer the case to that location.
