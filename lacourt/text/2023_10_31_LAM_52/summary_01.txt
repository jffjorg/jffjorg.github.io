Summary:

The judge issues a tentative ruling on a motion for preliminary injunction filed by Gerald Meehan and Lois Meehan against Gratitude Recovery, LLC, Kelly Seidlitz, Annette Seidlitz, Pacific Horizon Holdings, LLC, Royal Crest Sands Asset Group, LLC, Artha Ng, LLC, and Cliffside Malibu 1. The dispute centers on defendants' alleged trespassing on plaintiffs' property, including placing trash cans and a mailbox on the property, parking on the property, and maintaining and using their easement. The judge finds that plaintiffs have shown a strong likelihood of prevailing on the merits and that the balance of hardships moderately favors them. The judge grants the motion for preliminary injunction and orders plaintiffs to post an undertaking of $5,000. The injunction prohibits defendants from engaging in certain acts on plaintiffs' property, including removing, altering, cutting, or placing any object on the property, placing trash cans or recycle containers on the property, maintaining or using any mailbox on the property, parking on the property, and entering upon any part of the property other than the asphalt-paved portion of Horizon Drive and the main concrete driveway leading into defendants' property from Horizon Drive, pending trial in the action.
