 Case Number:  21STCV43011    Hearing Date:   October 31, 2023    Dept:  52 Plaintiff/Judgment
Creditor Cameron Moore’s Motion for an Assignment Order 
            Plaintiff/judgment
creditor Cameron Moore moves for an assignment order against judgment debtor
Zachery Bryan.  
            Code
of Civil Procedure section 708.510(a) provides that “the court may order the
judgment debtor to assign to the judgment creditor… all or part of a right to
payment due or to become due, whether or not the right is conditioned on future
developments.”  Assignable payments include
but are not limited to six enumerated types, including “Rents,” “Commissions,”
and “Royalties.”  (CCP § 708.510(a)(2)-(4).)  “Statutory provisions governing” assignment
orders “are subject to strict construction … because the remedies are purely
legislative creations; and to obtain them, a judgment creditor must comply with
all applicable procedural and other statutory requirements.”  (Landstar Global Logistics, Inc. v.
Robinson & Robinson, Inc. (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 378, 390.) 
This
motion is not sufficiently clear as to what rights Moore moves to have assigned
to him.  The notice of motion seeks
assignment of “Debtor’s present and future income interest in receivables
including but not limited to” 103 “sources of payment.”  (Notice of Motion, pp. 3-4.)  Many of the 103 things listed do not seem to
be “sources of payment,” per se.  Most appear
to be the names of television shows or movies. 
It is unlikely that “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” “Home Improvement,” or
“Touched by an Angel” will pay money to Bryan. 
Some unidentified business entities make any such payments.  
Moore
also does not establish Bryan has any “right to payment due or to become due”
(CCP § 708.510(a)) from these 103 purported sources.  It may be likely Bryan will receive future
payments for shows or movies that are regularly distributed to viewers, but Moore
provides no reliable evidence of that. 
Moore’s list also includes programs for which it is not likely Bryan
will receive any future payments, such as “Nickelodeon Kid’s Choice Awards ‘92”
and “The 7th Annual TV Land Awards.”
Finally,
Moore’s list includes at least 10 “sources of payment” that are not subject to
assignment.  Nos. 94 to 102 are financial
institutions.  Money deposited with a
financial institution is not a “right to payment or to become due” subject to
assignment under Code of Civil Procedure section 708.510(a).  An assignment order is “not the proper way to
enforce [a] money judgment against funds in [a debtor’s] possession.”  (FirstMerit Bank, N.A. v. Reese (2015)
242 Cal.App.4th 408, 414.)  A judgment
creditor may use “other statutory procedures for enforcing the judgment against
such funds.”  (Ibid.)  No. 103 on Moore’s list is “Any Trust
Involving Debtor [i.e., The Bryan Family Trust, etc.]”  A “ ‘judgment debtor’s interest as a
beneficiary of a trust is subject to enforcement of a money judgment only upon
petition under’ ” Code of Civil Procedure section 709.010.  (Id. at p. 413.)  A court may not “avoid the limitations on its
authority under section 709.010, subdivision (b) by entering an order under
section 708.510 that assigns” a debtor’s interest as a trust beneficiary.  (Ibid.)
Disposition
Plaintiff/judgment
creditor Cameron Moore’s motion for an assignment order is denied without
prejudice.
