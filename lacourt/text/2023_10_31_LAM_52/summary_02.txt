And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Cameron Moore's motion for an assignment order against Zachery Bryan without prejudice. The motion is unclear as to what rights Moore seeks to have assigned to him. Moore's list of 103 "sources of payment" includes many TV shows and movies, which are unlikely to pay money to Bryan. Additionally, Moore has not established that Bryan has any right to payment due or to become due from these sources. The judge also notes that some of the listed sources are not subject to assignment, such as financial institutions and trust funds. The motion is denied because it does not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 708.510(a) and because Moore has not established the necessary facts to support the motion.
