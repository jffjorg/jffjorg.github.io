 Case Number:  23STCV09236    Hearing Date:   October 31, 2023    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Entry of Default 
Plaintiff National Commercial Recovery, Inc. d/b/a Blair Smith and
Associates requests court judgment by default against defendants Roberto Flores
De Jesus (a/k/a numerous aliases), an individual d/b/a Sonia’s Produce; and
Sonia Ojeda (a/k/a numerous aliases), an individual d/b/a Sonia’s Produce.  Plaintiff’s

The court notes a typo on plaintiff’s proposed
judgment, which says “National Commercial Commercial Recovery, Inc.,” repeating
the word “Commercial” in plaintiff’s name. 
(JUD-100, § 5.a.)  The court will
modify the judgment to correct plaintiff’s name.
Plaintiff’s request for default
judgment is granted.  After
modifying it to correct plaintiff’s name in section 5.a., the court will sign
the proposed judgment plaintiff submitted on form JUD-100.
