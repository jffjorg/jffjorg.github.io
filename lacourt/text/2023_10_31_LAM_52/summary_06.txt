```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to set an order to show cause regarding "fee waiver fraud" by the plaintiff. The defendants presented insufficient evidence to support their claim that the plaintiff is not entitled to a fee waiver or that he is obtaining court services in bad faith. Additionally, the evidence presented concerns events prior to 2015 and is therefore stale and no longer relevant.

The judge has also denied the defendants' motion to expand the pre-filing order against the plaintiff. The defendants sought to expand the order to apply to people other than the plaintiff, who was previously determined to be a vexatious litigant, but provided no authority for doing so. Furthermore, they sought such an order without giving the people who would be enjoined notice of or an opportunity to respond to the motion.

Finally, the judge has denied the defendants' motion to hold the plaintiff in contempt for violating court orders. The defendants presented insufficient evidence for the court to issue an order to show cause regarding contempt.
