TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


March
  15, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


23STCV02046




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Compel Plaintiff’s Deposition




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan
  Transportation Authority




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
            Defendant
Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“Defendant”) moves to
compel Plaintiff Jimmie Creer’s (“Plaintiff”) deposition. No opposition has
been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the
action . . . , without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410,
fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for
inspection any document . . . described in the deposition notice, the party
giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance
and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document . . .
described in the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) 
 
“A motion under subdivision (a) [above] shall comply with
both of the following: 
 
1. The motion
shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice. 
2. The motion
shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040,
or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents,
electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition
notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent
to inquire about the nonappearance.” 
 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b).) 
 
If a motion is granted, the court shall impose a monetary
sanction in favor of that party unless the court finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450 (g).)
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
The Declaration of Robert W. Kane does not state that counsel attempted
to contact Plaintiff regarding the non-appearances. Therefore, the meet and
confer requirement has not been met. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Here, Defendant noticed Plaintiff’s deposition twice, set for November
29, 2023, and February 12, 2024. (Kane Decl. ¶ 2, 4, Exh. A, C.) Each time,
Plaintiff failed to appear and Defendant obtained certificates of
non-appearance. (Id. ¶ 3, 5, Exh. B, D.) Therefore, because it does not
appear that Plaintiff timely objected to the depositions, and does not oppose
this motion, the motion to compel is granted. 
 
The Court declines to award monetary sanctions since Defendant did not
request sanctions in its motion and failed to meet and confer.  
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s
motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition is GRANTED. Plaintiff Jimmie Creer shall
appear within 30 days’ notice of this order for a deposition.
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
