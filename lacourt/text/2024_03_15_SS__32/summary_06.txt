Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to continue trial, but only to October 21, 2024, rather than the requested January 2025. The Judge notes that the defendant has not provided sufficient explanation for the need for the continuance beyond October 21, 2024. The Final Status Conference is continued to October 7, 2024, and the trial is continued to October 21, 2024. The Judge's decision is based on California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, which sets forth the factors to consider in ruling on a motion to continue trial.
