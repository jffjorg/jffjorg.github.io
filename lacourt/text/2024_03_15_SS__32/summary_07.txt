And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Defendant's motion to compel the Plaintiff's deposition. The Plaintiff failed to appear for two scheduled depositions, and the Defendant obtained certificates of non-appearance. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff did not timely object to the depositions and did not oppose the motion. The Judge declines to award monetary sanctions since the Defendant did not request them and did not meet and confer with the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff is ordered to appear for a deposition within 30 days of the order.
