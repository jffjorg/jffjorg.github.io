Acuitas
Group Holdings, LLC vs. X, LLC, et al., Case No.: 23SMCV02836
Hearing
Date: Wednesday, February 7, 2024
Plaintiff
Acuitas Group’s Motion to Strike Defendant El-Batrawi’s Cross-Complaint/Motion
for Leave to File Cross-Complaint
Defendants X,
LLC and El-Batrawi allegedly defaulted on a $2,000,000 note from Plaintiff to X,
personally guaranteed by El-Batrawi. Plaintiff moves to strike El-Batrawi’s cross-complaint
(CCP 436). The parties met and conferred in accordance with CCP
§435.5(a). 
Plaintiff’s
primary contention is that the cross-complaint was not timely filed. El-Batrawi
seeks leave to file its amended cross-complaint and argues new party Terren Peizer
does not need leave, as the court has not set a trial date. CCP § 428.50.
El-Batrawi
concedes the cross-complaint was late filed but argues lack of prejudice. Per CCP
§428.50(a) a cross-complaint is to be filed before or at the time as the
answer. The Complaint was served July 14, 2023; the parties agreed to an
extension to August 29, 2023, which El-Batrawi failed to meet. El-Batrawi had
opportunities to file the XC but failed to do so; the papers give no
explanation as to the delay. 
The issues
in the proposed cross-complaint are “inextricably intertwined” with those in
the complaint. Were the court to deny the motion, presumably the
cross-complaint would be filed as a new complaint, and El-Batrawi would seek to
relate and/or consolidate the two matters. No trial date has been set; in fact,
the initial status conference will be held concurrent with the hearing on these
motions. There is no prejudice to plaintiff for the court to exercise its
discretion and allow for filing of the cross-complaint by El-Batrawi. GRANTED.
El-Batrawi and Peizer to file their cross-complaint within 10 court days.
