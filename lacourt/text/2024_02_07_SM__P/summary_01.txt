And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Daniella Wolf, seeks declaratory relief and quiet title, arguing that the promissory note and deed of trust are invalid. The defendants, Jerry Kohen et al., argue that the note created a line of credit and that the plaintiff and her husband owe them money.

The judge found that there are triable issues of fact regarding the nature of the loan created by the note, the existence and use of the line of credit, and the validity of the Credit Line Agreement. The judge also found that the plaintiff's argument that the defendants "slept on their rights" and that any rights they may have had expired is improper, as laches is an affirmative defense that can only be asserted by a defendant.

Finally, the judge found that there is a triable issue of fact as to whether the defendants suffered damages in the form of unpaid monies advanced under the note. The case will proceed to a hearing on February 7, 2024.
