And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Rahbar, has brought a negligence claim against defendants DW Investments, LLC and Wong, alleging that they failed to provide safe flooring, which caused him injuries. Defendant Wong has filed a demurrer, arguing that the claim fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The court has reviewed the demurrer and finds that the plaintiff's complaint is insufficient to state a cause of action. The court notes that the plaintiff does not specify what aspect of the flooring is alleged to be defective or dangerous, nor does he specify what occurred. The court also notes that the deed to the property is judicially noticed, but it is unclear whether it is the deed to the property at issue. The court sustains the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend.
