Summary:

The court issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers and motions to strike filed by the defendants (Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Metro Gold Line Foothill Extension Construction Authority, Kiewit Corporation, Kiewit-Parsons, Kiewit Infrastructure West Co., and Parsons Construction Group, Inc.) to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) filed by the plaintiffs (Alicia Olivares, Stephanie Watkin, Amaris Violet Gutierrez, Abel Valentino Gutierrez, and Angelina Victoria Gallegos).

The court sustained the defendants' demurrers to the plaintiffs' fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action without leave to amend, finding that the plaintiffs lack standing to bring their causes of action. The court also granted the defendants' motions to strike punitive damages as moot.

The court's ruling is based on the following grounds:

1. The plaintiffs' domestic partnership is not recognized by the Domestic Partner Act as it was not registered with the California Secretary of State.
2. The plaintiffs' stepchild, Gallegos, does not meet the requirements of Probate Code section 6454.
3. The plaintiffs' causes of action for wrongful death and survival fail to plead sufficient facts to state a claim.

The court set a hearing date of September 18, 2024, for further consideration of the demurrers and motions to strike.
