Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 22STCV27490, a motion for sanctions filed by Calvin Klein Studio, LLC against Plaintiff Carlotta Andrea Peart. The case arises from a alleged injury to Plaintiff's eye caused by a manufacturer's tag/label on clothing purchased from Macy's on 9/4/20. Calvin Klein Studio was improperly named as the defendant, and despite being informed of this fact, Plaintiff's counsel refused to dismiss the defendant from the complaint. The defendant filed an answer on 1/20/23 and subsequently filed the instant motion for sanctions on 10/16/23, seeking an order dismissing Calvin Klein Studio from the complaint with prejudice and/or imposing sanctions against Plaintiff and her attorneys.

The judge found that the instant motion was filed without providing the required "safe-harbor" period to Plaintiff, and that Calvin Klein Studio failed to provide any information regarding the attorney's fees and costs incurred. The judge also noted that Calvin Klein Studio has already been dismissed from the complaint, albeit without prejudice.

Therefore, the judge denied the motion for sanctions.
