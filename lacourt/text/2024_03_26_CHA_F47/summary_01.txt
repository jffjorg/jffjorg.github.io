And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set 1, and has ordered the plaintiff to provide further, verified responses within 30 days. The defendant had requested an award of sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel in the amount of $1,990.50, but the judge has denied this request due to the defendant's failure to clearly identify against whom sanctions are sought. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff's failure to provide further responses and the defective proof of service for the opposition to the motion warrant the imposition of sanctions, but the judge has not imposed sanctions in this case.
