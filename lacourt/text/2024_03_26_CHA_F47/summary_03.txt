And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the demurrer filed by the defendants (Tremendo, LLC; Takela Corbitt; Marlo Richardson; Greenwood & Company Management; Greenhouse Trees) to the plaintiff's (Minaskanian Properties, LLC) unlawful detainer action. The demurrer argues that the complaint is uncertain and fails to state a claim for unlawful detainer. However, the judge finds that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to state a claim for unlawful detainer and is not so uncertain that the defendants cannot respond. The judge also notes that the property at issue does not appear to be residential, and therefore, attaching a copy of the alleged written agreement is not required. As a result, the demurrer is placed off calendar as moot as to some defendants (Tremendo, LLC; Takela Corbitt; Greenwood & Company Management; Greenhouse Trees) due to the entry of default against these defendants. The demurrer is overruled as to Defendant Marlo Richardson, and an answer is due within 5 days.
