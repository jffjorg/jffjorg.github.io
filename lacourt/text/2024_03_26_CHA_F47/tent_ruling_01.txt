SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Araceli Ayala’s claim
that on 12/17/20 she was assaulted and battered by an unidentified third party
while shopping at a shopping center owned by Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Pacoima Plaza Shopping Center, LLC (Pacoima Plaza).  Plaintiff alleges that Pacoima Plaza is
liable for the alleged incident because it failed to provide adequate security
at the premises.  Plaintiff’s complaint indicates
that she is seeking damages for hospital and medical expenses, wage loss and
loss of earning capacity.
 
On 4/14/23, Pacoima Plaza served Plaintiff with Form
Interrogatories, Set 1.  (Dubin Decl.,
Ex.A).  On 8/25/23, Plaintiff served
responses to the interrogatories, without objections.  (Id., Ex.B).  However, Plaintiff did not provide any/adequate
responses to Form Interrogatories Nos. 6.5-6.7 and 8.1-8.8.
 
On 9/28/23, Pacoima Plaza’s counsel sent a meet and
confer letter to Plaintiff’s counsel regarding the responses and requesting
responses/further responses by 10/5/23. 
(Id., Ex.C).  No
responses/further responses were served, nor did Plaintiff request an extension
of time to respond.  On 10/9/23, Pacoima
Plaza’s counsel again contacted Plaintiff’s counsel regarding the subject
discovery responses.  Plaintiff did not
serve responses/further responses or otherwise respond.  (Id., Ex.D).
 
Therefore, on 10/11/23, Pacoima Plaza filed and served
the instant motion which seeks an order compelling Plaintiff to provide further
and verified responses, without objections, to Pacoima Plaza’s Form
Interrogatories, Set 1.  Additionally,
Pacoima Plaza requests an award of sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel
in the amount of $1,990.50.  On 3/21/24,
after a reply would have been due, Plaintiff filed a late opposition to the
motion.  See CCP 1005(b).  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff’s late opposition contends that she served
further responses to the subject discovery on 12/24/23.  Plaintiff contends that defense counsel
stated that such responses were not received; therefore, Plaintiff indicates
that she has since emailed a copy of the further responses to Pacoima Plaza
with a copy of the 12/24/23 proof of service attached.  
 
The proof of service for the opposition to the motion is
defective in that it indicates that it is for Plaintiff’s responses to the Form
Interrogatories, not the opposition.  (See
Opposition, pdf p.2).  Even of the
opposition was served on 3/21/24, the proof of service indicates that it was
served by United States Postal Service mail, not email.  If the opposition was served only by regular
USPS mail on 3/21/24, such service does not comply with CCP 1005(c).  Additionally, Pacoima Plaza may not receive the
opposition before the 3/26/24 hearing date. 

 
Even if Pacoima Plaza receives the opposition and
attached discovery responses, the responses are defective.  A response to interrogatories must state in
the first paragraph of the response immediately below the title of the case,
the identity of the responding party, the set number, and the identity of the
propounding party.  CCP 2030.210(b).
 
Here, Plaintiff’s “further responses” do not comply with
CCP 2030.210(b) in that they are merely labeled “Meet and Confer – Responses to
Further Requests.”  (See
Opposition, Ex.1).  Additionally, the
responses include responses to Form Interrogatories and Requests for Production
of Documents.  (See Opposition,
Ex.1, p.1:16-p.2:26 (“Additional Responses to Form Interrogatories),
p.3:1-p.7:14 (“Responses to Requests for Production of Documents”)).  Further, the verification attached to such
responses is defective because it is not clear if it applies only to
interrogatories or both the interrogatory responses and the document request
responses (which have been in separate documents).  (See Opposition, Ex.1, p.8 ¶¶2-3).
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff’s failure to provide any
further responses before the filing of the motion and the failure to provide
proper further responses thereafter would warrant the imposition of sanctions.  See CCP 2030.300(d).  However, Pacoima Plaza has failed to clearly
identify against whom sanctions are sought. 

 
CCP 2023.040 requires that a request for sanctions, “in the
notice of motion, identify every person, party, and attorney against whom the
sanction is sought, and specify the type of sanction sought.”  Here, the notice of motion indicates that monetary
sanctions are sought “against Plaintiff and her counsel” without identifying
any specific attorney.  (See
Motion, p.2:7-10).  In the memorandum of
points and authorities, Pacoima Plaza seems to only request sanctions against
Plaintiff.  (See Motion,
p.8:4-p.9:5).
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff is ordered to provide further, verified
responses, without objections to Pacoima Plaza’s Form Interrogatories, Set 1,
within 30 days.  The request for
sanctions is denied.
