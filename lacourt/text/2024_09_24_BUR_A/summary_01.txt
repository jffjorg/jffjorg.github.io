And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering a motion for summary judgment filed by the Burbank Community YMCA. The plaintiff, W. Roe, alleges that he was sexually assaulted by a lifeguard named Steve while attending YMCA after school in 1987. YMCA argues that it had no knowledge of Steve's propensity for child abuse and that the assault was not foreseeable.

The judge notes that California law requires a showing of foreseeability before a defendant can be held liable for the harm caused by a third party. The judge concludes that YMCA presented no evidence that it had prior knowledge of the potential for child sexual abuse or that it had implemented safeguards to prevent such abuse.

The judge also notes that the cases relied upon by the plaintiff, including Doe v. United States Youth Soccer Assn., Inc. and Doe v. Los Angeles County Dept. of Children & Family Services, require a showing of foreseeability beyond general awareness of the risk of child sexual abuse. The judge finds that the evidence in this case does not support such a finding.

The judge is considering the motion for summary judgment and will make a final ruling after argument.
