And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a motion to be relieved as counsel, filed by Ashour, counsel of record for Plaintiff LA Exotic Rentals Inc. The motion was unopposed, and the judge found that absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney's request for withdrawal should be granted. The client has ceased all communication with the counsel, preventing the counsel from effectively representing the client's interests. The judge also noted that the client has already dismissed the action, so there is no prejudice to the plaintiff. The judge did, however, note that the proposed order does not include the plaintiff's current or last known telephone number, and counsel must provide this information at the hearing. The judge granted the motion, subject to the provision of the plaintiff's telephone number, and effective upon filing a proof of service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 order and this order on LA Exotic Rentals Inc. and all parties who have appeared.
