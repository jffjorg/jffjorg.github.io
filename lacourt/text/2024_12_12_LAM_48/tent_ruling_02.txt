  CASE NO.: 21STCV17866
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO CONTINUE
  TRIAL 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 12, 2024



 
At the February 23, 2024 Case Management
Conference, the Court set a June 23, 2025 Final Status Conference and a July 21,
2025 trial in this action.
On
November 8, 2024, Caesar James Bijou dba Bijou Construction Co. (“Bijou”) filed
a motion to continue the trial date.
A
court may grant a continuance of trial upon a showing of good cause.  (California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c).)  Good cause includes the excusable unavailability
of trial counsel or a party’s excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents,
or other material evidence despite diligent efforts.  (California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c)(3),
(c)(6).)  The court must consider all the facts and circumstances
that are relevant to the determination.  (California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).)
Counsel
declares that two days before the Case Management Conference, his wife prepaid a
vacation for July 25 through August 8, 2025. 
(Reyes Decl. ¶ 5.)  Counsel inadvertently
failed to share this vacation information with the associate attorney who attended
the Case Management Conference.  (Reyes Decl.
¶ 6.)  Counsel did not realize that he had
a calendar conflict with the trial date until he was recently reviewing his 2025
trial calendar.  (Reyes Decl. ¶ 7.)  Counsel met and conferred with all parties involved
in this case, and they stipulated to continuing the trial to September 8, 2025,
with all discovery deadlines to conform with the new trial date.  (Reyes Decl. ¶ 8 & Ex A.)
On
November 25, 2024, Bijou filed a Notice of Non-Opposition and asked the Court to
grant the motion without a hearing.  If the
parties had submitted a stipulation and proposed order instead of this motion, the
Court could have signed the order without a hearing.
The
unopposed motion to continue trial is GRANTED.
The
Final Status Conference is CONTINUED to ______________.
The
Jury Trial is CONTINUED to ______________.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
