And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to compel production of communications with the plaintiff's parents. The judge finds that the communications are not relevant to enforcing the judgment against the plaintiff and that the defendant has not shown how the plaintiff's parents can be considered liable for the judgment. The judge also notes that the defendant's argument that the communications may show that the plaintiff's parents are alter-ego judgment debtors is unsupported. The judge cites various California court cases to support the ruling, including Finance Holding Co. LLC v. The American Institute of Certified Tax Coaches, Inc. and Highland Springs Conference & Training Center v. City of Banning. The judge's ruling is subject to change based on any submissions made by the parties.
