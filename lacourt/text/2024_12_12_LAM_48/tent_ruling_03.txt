  CASE NO.: 21STCV28753
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR
  ATTORNEY FEES AND DISBURSING SALE PROCEEDS
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 12, 2024



 
On November 6, 2023, the Court ordered an
interlocutory judgment in favor of Plaintiff Leontyne R. Taylor for partition
of the disputed real property in this action. 
On June 18, 2024, the Court signed an order confirming the sale of the
property.
On
September 5, 2024, the Court entered an order approving payment to the
Partition Referee and discharging the Partition Referee.  The Partition Referee has deposited the remaining
$308,470.10 proceeds with the Clerk of the Los Angeles County Superior Court.
Counsel
for Plaintiff filed a declaration with a proposed distribution of the sale proceeds.  On September 10, 2024, the Court set an Order
to Show Cause Re: Adopting Plaintiff’s Proposed Distribution of Proceeds and
ordered briefing.
ATTORNEY FEES
On
April 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed a memorandum of costs.  On April 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to
apportion attorney fees and costs.
The
costs of partition include reasonable attorney fees incurred or paid by a party
for the common benefit.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 874.010, subd. (a).)  The
“common benefit” in a partition action is the proper distribution of the
respective shares and interests in said property by the ultimate judgment of
the court, even when the partition was opposed. 
(Orien v. Lutz (2017) 16 Cal.App.5th 957, 967.)
Through
April 1, 2024, Plaintiff paid her counsel $13,837.50 in fees at counsel’s $225
hourly rate.  (Belshaw Fees Decl. ¶
6.)  The Court has reviewed the invoices
and finds that the fees are reasonable.  As
of November 25, 2024, the total attorney fees are $17,212.32.  (See Belshaw 2nd Distribution Decl. ¶¶ 8, 10.)
The
motion is GRANTED.  The apportionment of
attorney fees is $8,606.16 each.
Plaintiff
“has paid all of the attorney fees out of her own pocket.”  (Belshaw Fees Decl. ¶ 6.)  Accordingly, the Court will deduct $8,606.16
from Defendant’s share of the distribution as reimbursement to Plaintiff.
DISTRIBUTION OF PROCEEDS
On
November 6, 2023, the Court ordered:  “The
Wells Fargo Bank loan and the Los Angeles Federal Credit Union loan will be
paid first and then expenses of sale will be paid.  The remaining balance shall be split evenly
between the parties except that the entire balance of the two loans will be
paid from the Defendant’s share.  [¶]  Further,
the Court may grant additional credits to one or both of the parties based on
the fair market rental value of the property from and after November 6, 1996,
monies spent improving, repairing, or maintaining the property from and after
November 6, 1996, and property taxes paid from and after November 6, 1996.  The parties’ case remains open to present
additional evidence.”
A.        Defendant is Not Entitled to Any
Additional Credits.
Defendant
argues that he did not receive $195,793.46 equity, as Plaintiff states, because
“this sum is the payoff of the two loans.” 
(Opposition at p. 2.)  The Court
ordered that the entire balance of the Wells Fargo Bank loan and the Los
Angeles Federal Credit Union loan be paid from the Defendant’s share.
Defendant
requests reimbursement of property taxes and homeowner’s insurance.  (Opposition at pp. 3-4.)  The Court’s November 6, 2023 order did state
that the Court may grant additional credits to one or both of the parties “based
on the fair market rental value of the property from and after November 6,
1996, monies spent improving, repairing, or maintaining the property from and
after November 6, 1996, and property taxes paid from and after November 6,
1996.”  The case remained open to present
additional evidence.  However, Defendant
does not provide any admissible evidence.
Defendant
states that “[t]he total estimated taxes paid by Defendant is: $41,400.00.  Plaintiff to Reimburse Defendant the sum of
$20,700.00.”  (Opposition at p. 4.)  There is no supporting evidence for his
1997-2006 and 2007-2014 totals, and “[f]rom 2015-2017 the amount is unknown so
let’s leave it at $2,400.00 for 2 years = $4,800.00.”  (Ibid.)  The Court will not credit Defendant for
estimated and unsupported property taxes.
Similarly,
“[t]he total estimated Homeowner’s Insurance is not known for all the years
from 11/1996 to 2024,” but “the amounts where receipts can be produced and paid
by Defendant is: $3,284.38.”  (Opposition
at p. 4.)  Defendant provides an
unauthenticated Renewal Declaration showing a premium of $623.38 for December
9, 2022 to December 9, 2023, and an unauthenticated email from a State Farm
Agent that lists Defendant’s annual premiums from December 2013 through
December 2023.  The Court will not credit
Defendant for unsupported homeowner’s insurance.
Defendant
requests that Plaintiff be solely responsible for $9,490.50 paid out of escrow
for her personal state tax.  (Opposition
at p. 4.)  The Court’s November 6, 2023
order did not permit this credit, and Defendant provides no authenticated
evidence.
Defendant
requests reimbursement of mortgage payments. 
(Opposition at pp. 4-5.)  “As for
the mortgage payments made over the years, it’s hard to calculate, so we’ll
stick with the balance that was paid off at the time of sale.”  (Id. at p. 4.)  Defendant therefore requests one-half of the $195,793.46
mortgage paid by escrow.  (Id. at
pp. 4-5.)  This is the total amount of
the Wells Fargo Bank and the Los Angeles Federal Credit Union loans, and the
Court already ordered that the two loans be paid entirely from Defendant’s
share of the distribution.
Defendant
has not shown entitlement to any additional credits.  The Court is therefore inclined to adopt
Plaintiff’s proposed distribution.
B.        Plaintiff’s Proposed Distribution
Because
Defendant already received $195,793.46 in equity from the loan payoffs,
Plaintiff will first receive an equal $195,793.46 from the $308,470.10
deposited funds.
The
remaining $112,676.64 of the deposited funds will be divided equally between
the parties at $56,338.32 each.  Plaintiff’s
balance so far: $252,131.78 ($195,793.46 + $56,338.32).  Defendant’s balance so far: $56,338.32.
Each
party is responsible for $8,606.16 in attorney fees.  Plaintiff has already paid the full amount to
her attorney, so Defendant’s $8,606.16 share is to reimburse Plaintiff.  Plaintiff’s balance so far: $260,737.94 ($252,131.78
+ $8,606.16).  Defendant’s balance so
far: $47,732.16 ($56,338.32 - $8,606.16).
Plaintiff,
the prevailing party in this partition action, filed a memorandum of costs in
the amount of $2,739.30.  This amount
will be paid by Defendant to Plaintiff as reimbursement for her costs.  Plaintiff’s balance so far: $263,477.24 ($260,737.94
+ $2,739.30).  Defendant’s balance so
far: $44,992.86 ($47,732.16 - $2,739.30).
Based
on Plaintiff’s proposed distribution and the evidence presented, Plaintiff is
entitled to $263,477.24, and Defendant is entitled to $44,992.86.
C.        The Court’s Alternative Calculation
Method
To
further clarify the distribution amounts, the Court presents an alternative
calculation for the same distribution.
The
Wells Fargo Bank loan and the Los Angeles Federal Credit Union loan were paid
out of escrow for a total of $195,793.46. 
(Belshaw 2nd Distribution Decl. ¶ 4.) 
The Court will add this amount to the deposited funds to begin the
calculations.  The starting balance for
distribution is $504,263.56 ($252,131.78 each).
From
the starting balance, the loans are paid from Defendant’s half.  Defendant’s deductions so far: $195,793.46.
The
apportioned attorney fees are $8,606.16 for each party.  Plaintiff has already paid the full amount to
her attorney, so Defendant’s $8,606.16 share is to reimburse Plaintiff.  Only Defendant, not Plaintiff, will incur
this deduction.  Defendant’s deductions
so far: $204,399.62 ($195,793.46 + $8,606.16).
The
memorandum of costs is in the amount of $2,739.30.  Only Defendant, not Plaintiff, will incur
this deduction.  Defendant’s deductions
so far: $207,138.92 ($204,399.62 + $2,739.30).
From
Defendant’s $252,131.78 starting balance, $207,138.92 must be deducted, for a
final balance of $44,992.86.
Defendant’s
attorney fees and costs deductions are shifted as credits to Plaintiff.  From Plaintiff’s $252,131.78 starting balance,
she is credited $11,345.46 ($8,606.16 + $2,739.30), for a final balance of $263,477.24.
D.        Conclusion
The
Court orders that the $308,470.10 deposited with the Clerk of the Los Angeles
County Superior Court be distributed as follows: $263,477.24 to Plaintiff Leontyne
R. Taylor and $44,992.86 to Defendant Eric E. Burl.
Plaintiff
is ordered to submit a proposed judgment within 5 days.
Moving
