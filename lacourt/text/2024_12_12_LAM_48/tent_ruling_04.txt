  CASE NO.: 22STCV38383
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER TAKING HEARING ON APPLICATION
  FOR ADMISSION PRO HAC VICE OFF CALENDAR
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 12, 2024



 
On
November 15, 2024, Evan M. Oshan filed an ex parte application to be admitted pro
hac vice to represent Plaintiffs Yael Sima Wintner and Tova Fagan in this action.  Counsel noticed a November 18, 2024 hearing.
On
November 18, 2024 counsel filed another ex parte application to be admitted pro
hac vice, noticing a November 19, 2024 hearing. 
Counsel also filed a verified application for admission pro hac vice, noticing
a December 12, 2024 hearing.
At
the November 18, 2024 hearing (on the November 15, 2024 ex parte application), the
Court ordered counsel to file a proper application and to pay the $500.00 filing
fee.  The Court continued the hearing to December
10, 2024.
At
the November 19, 2024 hearing (on the November 18, 2024 ex parte application), the
Court denied the ex parte application and reiterated its order to pay the $500.00
filing fee.
At
the December 10, 2024 hearing (continued from November 18, 2024), the Court identified
the deficiencies in counsel’s application, continued the hearing, and permitted
counsel to file an amended, complete application no later than December 16, 2024.
This
hearing is now moot in light of the order continuing the hearing on the application
to December 19, 2024.
The
Hearing on Motion to be Admitted Pro Hac Vice scheduled for 12/12/2024 at 8:30 AM
is taken off calendar.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
