And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Defendant's motion to strike paragraphs from the first amended complaint that allege intentional discrimination and retaliation against Plaintiff Yvette Morales. Defendant sought to strike paragraphs that alleged the Board of Directors of Women's and Children's Crisis Shelter, Inc. intentionally discriminated against Plaintiff because she was pregnant and then lied about their reasons for terminating her employment. The Judge found that while the paragraphs in question are conclusory, the first amended complaint contains other allegations that provide context and factual support for the conclusions. The Judge also noted that Defendant failed to engage with the substance of Plaintiff's allegations and demonstrate why the allegations are insufficient. As a result, the motion to strike is denied, and Defendant is ordered to file an answer within 10 days.
