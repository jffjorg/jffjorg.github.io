  CASE NO.: 23STCV06001
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 12, 2024



 
Ash
Ashour, counsel of record for Plaintiff LA Exotic Rentals Inc., seeks to be relieved
as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration states
that the client has ceased all communications with counsel, preventing counsel from
effectively representing the client’s interests in this matter.  No party opposed the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
mostly complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Plaintiff already dismissed this action, so there
is no prejudice to Plaintiff.
The
proposed order does not include Plaintiff’s current or last known telephone number.  Counsel must provide this information at the hearing.
Subject
to the provision of Plaintiff’s telephone number, the unopposed motion to be relieved
is GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of service showing service of the signed
Form MC-053 order and this order on LA Exotic Rentals Inc. and all parties who have
appeared.
 “[A] corporation cannot represent itself in a court
of record either in propria persona or through an officer or agent who is not an
attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic
Beverage Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  Therefore, if Plaintiff attempts to take any post-dismissal
action here, it must first retain counsel.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
