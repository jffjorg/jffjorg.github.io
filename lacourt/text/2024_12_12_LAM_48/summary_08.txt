And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition to compel an appraisal of the property damage. The dispute arises from the denial of insurance coverage by California Fair Plan Association (Respondent) following a wind event on January 10, 2023. The Respondent inspected the property, denied coverage, and withdrew from the appraisal process. The Judge finds that the Respondent is not equitably estopped from refusing an appraisal because it withdrew from the process after discovering that the property had been demolished, making it impossible to determine the property damage. The Judge also finds that the appraisal provision in the insurance policy does not apply to the denial of coverage, as the dispute is over policy coverage, not the "amount of loss" governed by the policy's appraisal provision. Therefore, the petition is denied, and the action is dismissed.
