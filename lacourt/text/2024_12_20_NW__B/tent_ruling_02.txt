BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from a May 15, 2021, assault
in which Plaintiff Joselyn Espinoza (“Plaintiff”) alleges an employee of Defendant

Marian de Jesus (“de Jesus”), and Does 1 to 100 (collectively “Defendants”),
alleging six causes of action: (1) assault; (2) battery; (3) premises
liability; (4) negligence; (5) negligent supervision; and (6) intentional
infliction of emotional distress.
 
On June 5, 2024, the case was reassigned
to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East,
effective June 24, 2024.
 
On July 1, 2024, Defendant entered
default.
 
On December 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant request for default judgment against Defendant.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 585
permits entry of a default judgment after a party has failed to timely respond
or appear. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 585.) A party seeking judgment on the
default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief
summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support
of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a
memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration of nonmilitary status;
(6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom
judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579,
supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary;
and (9) a request for attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement
of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.)
