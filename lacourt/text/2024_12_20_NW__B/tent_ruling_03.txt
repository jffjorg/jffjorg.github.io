Defendant: Sargis Tovmasyan
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff United Financial Casualty
Company’s request for default judgment against Defendant Sargis Tovmasyan is GRANTED.
            
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from an August 23, 2019,
motor vehicle accident. Plaintiff United Financial Casualty Company
(“Plaintiff”) alleges that Defendant Sargis Tovmasyan (“Defendant”),
negligently operating their motor vehicle, caused property damage to their
insured.
 
On June 16, 2022, Plaintiff filed a
complaint alleging one cause of action for motor vehicle negligence.
 
On June 5, 2024, the case was reassigned
to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East,
effective June 24, 2024.
 
On December 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant request for default judgment against Defendant.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 585 permits
entry of a default judgment after a party has failed to timely respond or
appear. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 585.) A party seeking judgment on the
default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief
summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support
of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a
memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration of nonmilitary status;
(6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom
judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579,
supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary;
and (9) a request for attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement
of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800.) 
 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff seeks damages in the amount of
$52,150.45, representing $51,631.45 in special damages and $519.00 in costs.
 
Defendant has
failed to timely respond or appear. Plaintiff’s default packet meets all
statutory requirements under CCP § 585. Therefore, Plaintiff’s request for
default judgment against Sargis Tovmasyan is GRANTED.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.  Court to sign JUD – 100.
