COMPLAINT
  FILED: OCTOBER 18, 2024
TRIAL DATE: NONE



 
I.       BACKGROUND
On October 18, 2024, Appellants
Nader Rafiee (“Rafiee”) and OITN TV Corp. (“OITN”)(collectively “Appellants”) filed
a notice of appeal to the Labor Commissioner’s award in favor of Respondent Sepehr
Khosravi (“Khosravi”). (See October 18, 2024, Notice of Appeal.) On
April 11, 2021, Khosravi filed an initial claim with the Labor Commissioner’s
office for owed wages. (Ibid.; Labor Commissioner Award.)
On October 18, 2024, the case was
assigned to the Honorable Valerie Salkin in Dept. U at Van Nuys Courthouse
East.
On October 30, 2024, Khosravi filed
a peremptory challenge to Judge Salkin pursuant to Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §
170.6. On the same day, the challenge was accepted and the case was reassigned
to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B of Van Nuys Courthouse East.
On November 8, 2024, Khosravi filed
the instant motion to dismiss.
Appellants
have not filed an opposition.
 
II.   
LEGAL STANDARD
Cal. Code of Civ. Procedure § 583.410
provides that an action can be dismissed under appropriate circumstances when
made “pursuant to the procedure and in accordance with the criteria prescribed
by rules adopted by the Judicial Council.” (CCP § 583.410(a) and (b).) This
criteria includes:
(1) The court's file in the case and the
declarations and supporting data submitted by the parties and, where
applicable, the availability of the moving party and other essential parties
for service of process;
(2) The diligence in seeking to effect
service of process;
(3) The extent to which the parties engaged
in any settlement negotiations or discussions;
(4) The diligence of the parties in pursuing
discovery or other pretrial proceedings, including any extraordinary relief
sought by either party;
(5) The nature and complexity of the case;
(6) The law applicable to the case, including
the pendency of other litigation under a common set of facts or determinative
of the legal or factual issues in the case;
(7) The nature of any extensions of time or
other delay attributable to either party;
(8) The condition of the court's calendar and
the availability of an earlier trial date if the matter was ready for trial;
(9) Whether the interests of justice are best
served by dismissal or trial of the case; and
(10) Any other fact or circumstance relevant
to a fair determination of the issue.
 
III.  ANALYSIS
Khosravi moves to
dismiss the instant action on the grounds that appellants failed to meet the
mandatory and jurisdictional prerequisites to maintain an appeal, thereby depriving
this Court of jurisdiction. (Memorandum of Points & Authorities (“MPA”) p.
1:21-23.) Khosravi also argues that OITN lacks legal capacity to defend or maintain
the instant appeal because the State of California suspended its corporate
rights, powers, and privileges. (Ibid. at 23-24.)
 
Jurisdiction
            Khosravi argues
that the Court does not have jurisdiction over this case because Appellants
failed to post an undertaking pursuant to Cal. Lab. Code § 98.2(b).
Lab. Code § 98.2
governs appealing orders, decisions, or awards determined by the Labor
Commissioner. (Lab. Code § 98.2(a).) As a condition to filing an appeal
pursuant to § 98.2, an employer shall first post an undertaking in the amount
of the order, decision, or award. (Lab. Code § 98.2(b).) “The employer shall
provide written notification to the other parties and the Labor Commissioner of
the posting of the undertaking.” (Ibid.) An appeal and undertaking under
§ 98.2 must be filed within ten days of service of the Labor Commissioner’s
order, with an additional five days for service by mail to in-state parties.
(Lab. Code § 98.2(a); CCP § 1013.) If an employer-appellant fails to file the
appeal and post the undertaking within 15 days of service of the Labor
Commissioner’s order, the Court does not have jurisdiction proceed and must
dismiss the case. “[T]he court has no authority to extend the deadline for
posting the undertaking beyond the deadline for filing the notice of appeal.” (Palagin
v. Paniagua Construction, Inc. (2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 124, 140.)
Here,
the Labor Commissioner’s order was served on October 3, 2024. (Raymond Decl. ¶
2; Exh. 1 [order].) Appellants filed their appeal on October 18, 2024. (Ibid.
at ¶ 3.) Appellants failed to post an undertaking, nor did they request a
waiver of the bond. (Ibid. at ¶ 4.) Therefore, Appellants have failed to
timely post an undertaking within 15 days of service of the Labor
Commissioner’s order as required by Lab. Code § 98.2. As a result, the Court
lacks jurisdiction and the appeal must be dismissed pursuant to Lab. Code §
98.2 and CCP § 583.410(6).
 
OITN’s Status
Additionally,
OITN lacks the capacity to bring this appeal. A corporation suspended for
non-payment of its franchise taxes is without capacity to maintain or defend a
civil action while it is suspended. (Tabarrejo v. Superior Court (2014)
232 Cal.App.4th 849, 861.) The State of California has suspended OITN’s
corporate powers, rights, and privileges. (See Raymond Decl. ¶ 5; Exh. 2
[Secretary of State search results].) Therefore, OITN lacks capacity to bring
forth its appeal and the appeal must be dismissed pursuant to CCP § 583.410(6)
and (10).
 
Attorney’s Fees
and Costs
If the party seeking appeal is unsuccessful, then they
are assessed attorney’s fees and costs for the cost of the appeal. (Lab. Code §
98.2(c).) Here, Khosravi’s counsel spent two hours preparing the instant motion
at an hourly rate of $450.00. (Raymond Decl. ¶ 6.) Therefore, the Court awards
attorney’s fees and costs in the amount of $900.00 against Appellants and their
counsel, jointly and severally, payable to Khosravi’s counsel within 20 days of
this hearing.
 
 
IV.
 CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Khosravi’s motion
to dismiss pursuant to CCP § 583.410 is GRANTED and the case is dismissed with
prejudice. Appellants and their counsel, jointly and severally, are to pay
$900.00 in attorney’s fees and costs to Khosravi’s counsel within 20 days of
this hearing.
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
