And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted United Financial Casualty Company's request for default judgment against Sargis Tovmasyan. The case arises from a motor vehicle accident on August 23, 2019, in which Tovmasyan allegedly negligently operated his vehicle, causing property damage to United Financial Casualty Company's insured. Despite being served with a complaint on June 16, 2022, Tovmasyan failed to timely respond or appear in court. United Financial Casualty Company filed a request for default judgment on December 13, 2024, which meets all statutory requirements under California Code of Civil Procedure § 585. As a result, the judge has granted the request and ordered United Financial Casualty Company to give notice.
