This is a habitability matter.  A notice of related cases has been filed with respect to 22VECV02216, which is another habitability matter brought by different tenants.The inquiry on a notice of related cases is whether the cases at issue (1) involve the same parties and are based on the same or similar claims; (2) arise from the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact; (3) involve claims against, title to, possession of, or damages to the same property; or (4) are likely for other reasons to require substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a).)Because the cases pertain to different plaintiffs relating the cases would not result in significant efficiency.  The cases will not be related.
