And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling in a habitability matter. The court has received a notice of related cases regarding another habitability matter brought by different tenants, but after reviewing the information, the court has decided not to relate the cases. The court will not combine the cases because they involve different plaintiffs and different claims, and relating the cases would not result in significant efficiency or cost savings.
