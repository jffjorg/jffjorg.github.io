And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies in part and grants in part the defendants' motion to modify the order appointing a receiver. The court finds that the defendants do not articulate good cause for modifying the order and that the motion is an improper motion for reconsideration. The court also modifies paragraphs 2 and 3 of the order to clarify the definitions of "liquid assets" and "hard assets". The court finds that the defendants' concerns about waiving their Fifth Amendment rights are unfounded and that they can cooperate with the receiver without waiving their rights. The court provides guidelines for how the defendants can exercise their Fifth Amendment rights if they choose not to cooperate with the receiver. The ruling also requires the plaintiff's counsel to provide notice and file proof of service with the court.
