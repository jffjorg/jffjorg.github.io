[Tentative] Order Granting in Part and
Denying in Part
Petition for Writ of Administrative
Mandate
 
INTRODUCTION

 
            The Boeing Company
(“Petitioner” or “Boeing”) filed this petition for writ of mandate under
California Water Code section 13330 and California Code of Civil Procedure
section 1094.5 challenging waste discharge requirements (the “WDRs”) for the
Santa Susana Field Laboratory set by the Regional Water Quality Control Board,
Los Angeles (“Respondent” or the “Board”). 
The final WDRs imposed, among other things, six requirements that
Petitioner challenges in its writ petition: (1) New effluent limits at Outfalls
001 and 002; (2) New effluent limits for aluminum; (3) A new monitoring
requirement for PCB congeners; (4) New monitoring requirements for constituents
listed in the Department of Toxic Substances Control’s “Standardized Risk
Assessment Methodology” for SSFL; (5) Retained effluent limits from the prior
NPDES permit; and (6) New requirements for groundwater infiltration studies at
the Silvernale and R-1 Ponds.  
 
The Board has authority to impose the monitoring
requirements at issue.  However, there is
an abuse of discretion if the Board’s decisions are not supported by the
findings.  (Topanga Ass’n for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles
(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 515.)  In this
case, the Board did not make sufficient findings with respect to two monitoring
requirements.  First, the Board imposed
monitoring requirements with respect to the chemicals listed in Table 12-1.  The record is unclear whether these
requirements apply to every chemical on the list.  If so, Board did not make sufficient findings,
especially with respect to chemicals that are “naturally
occurring” and “low toxicity,” like acetic acid and
titanium.  Second, the Board elected to
continue monitoring for antimony,
nickel, selenium, thallium, and TCDD at Outfall 008, even though the Board
expressly acknowledged recent data indicating that there is no reasonable
potential for these constituents to cause or
contribute to an excursion above any water quality standard.  The Board did not make sufficient findings to
explain this discrepancy.
 
Based upon the foregoing, the court issues
a writ directing the Board to set aside these requirements and to reconsider
them in light of this court’s decision and judgment.  This order shall not prevent the Board from
re-imposing these requirements, provided the Board makes sufficient
findings.  The court’s decision to set aside
the monitoring of chemicals in Table 12-1 applies only to “[a]dditional remaining
COPCs for all media as identified in the SRAM” and does not disturb the
monitoring requirements of any chemical specifically identified in Table E-2 or
of any chemical subject to monitoring through a different WDR.  In other words, this ruling applies only to chemicals
list in Table 12-1 that are not identified elsewhere in the WDRs or otherwise subject
to monitoring.  The petition is otherwise
denied.  
BACKGROUND 
 
A.        The Santa Susana Field Laboratory
 
            The Santa Susana Field Laboratory (“SSFL”)
is a 2,850-acre, former industrial property in the Simi Hills of Ventura
County.  (AR 6835.)  The SSFL site is located within miles of the
West San Fernando Valley and Simi Valley, among other residential
communities.  (AR 5987.)  “More than 700,000 people live within ten
miles of SSFL.”  (Ibid.)   
 
The SSFL site is
jointly owned by Petitioner and the federal government.  (AR 6835.)  
SSFL has a long history of site contamination caused by former industrial
activities of Petitioner, its predecessors, and the federal government.  As summarized in the Fact Sheet for the WDRs:
 
Boeing and its
predecessors’ operations at SSFL included research, development, assembly,
disassembly, and testing of rocket engines, and chemical lasers. During the
1950s to the mid-1970s, volatile organic compounds were utilized for the
cleaning of hardware and rocket engine thrust chambers, and for the cleaning of
other equipment. These solvents migrated into the subsurface, contaminating
groundwater primarily with trichloroethylene (TCE) and 1,2- dichloroethylene
(1,2-DCE). 
 
NASA operations
included rocket engine assembly and testing, propellant and fuel storage and
loading. Rocket engine testing began at SSFL in the 1950s. An engine test
consisted of a cycle of one to three engine runs lasting one to three minutes
each. A test cycle may take one to two weeks to complete. Each engine run
resulted in the use of 50,000 to 200,000 gallons of deluge/cooling water that
contacted fuels such as liquid oxygen (LOX) or kerosene and associated
combustion products. The frequency of testing historically varied depending on
production requirements. In July 2004, the frequency of testing was one test
cycle every one or two months. In late 2006, the rocket engine and component
testing operations at the Facility were terminated. These tests generated fuel
related pollutants and heavy metals. Two of the test stand complexes and the
associated spillways remain onsite….
 
[The Department of
Energy’s] past operations included research and development of energy related
programs, and seismic testing experiments. The activities included developing,
testing and operating nuclear reactors and fabricating and disassembling
nuclear fuel. DOE began to phase out the program in the 1960s. The last reactor
was shut down in 1980, and nuclear research was terminated in 1989. The
research and the associated activities resulted in residual soil and
groundwater contamination.
 
(AR
6836.)
 
            Industrial operations at the SSFL site
have ceased, and current activities include environmental monitoring and remediation.  Petitioner and the federal government have
been implementing soil and groundwater investigation and cleanup at SSFL, under
orders by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (“DTSC”).  (AR 6836, 33729.)
 
            Each time it
rains, pollutants at the site have the potential to mix with stormwater that
runs over the soil and, eventually, off the site through discrete “Discharge
Points” or “Outfalls”. (AR 6835-6838, 6846.)  Most of the stormwater is collected in two
ponds, Silvernale and R-1, before being treated and discharged via Discharge
Points 011 and 018. (AR 6837.) As relevant
to this writ petition, the Fact Sheet summarizes the stormwater discharges from
the site as follows:
 
SSFL has the potential (based on a 24-hour duration, 10-year
return storm event) to discharge approximately 187 million gallons per day
(MGD) of stormwater runoff that may contain pollutants from the Facility.
Approximately 60% of the discharge exits the property via two southerly
discharge points (Discharge Points 001 and 002) to Bell Creek, a tributary to
the Los Angeles River, a water of the United States, with its confluence
located near the intersection of Bassett Street and Owensmouth Avenue in Canoga
Park. Upstream outfalls that contribute to the discharge at Discharge Points
001 and 002 include Discharge Points 011 and 018.
 
…..
 
The stormwater
from the northern boundary of the site is discharged via Discharge Points 003
through 007 and 010 or it is transferred to Silvernale Pond for treatment prior
to discharge at Discharge Point 018.
 
(AR
6837.)  
 
B.        The Clean Water Act and the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
 
Petitioner
and the SSFL site are subject to waste discharge requirements under the federal
Clean Water Act and California’s Porter-Cologne Water
Quality Control Act because stormwater discharges
associated with former industrial activities at the site continue to occur at
and from SSFL.  “The Clean Water
Act is a ‘comprehensive water quality statute designed ‘to restore and maintain
the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters.’”  (City of Burbank v. State Water Resources
Control Board (2005) 35 Cal.4th 613,
620, citations omitted.)  “To accomplish
this goal, the Act established ‘effluent limitations,’ which are restrictions
on the ‘quantities, rates, and concentrations of chemical, physical,
biological, and other constituents’; these effluent limitations allow the
discharge of pollutants only when the water has been satisfactorily treated to
conform with federal water quality standards.” 
(Ibid., citing 33 U.S.C. 
§§ 1311, 1362(11).)  
 
Part of the federal Clean Water Act is the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), the primary means for enforcing
effluent limitations and standards under the Clean Water Act.  The NPDES sets out the conditions under which
the federal EPA or a state with an approved water quality control program can
issue permits for the discharge of pollutants in wastewater.  In California, wastewater discharge
requirements established by the regional boards are the equivalent of the NPDES
permits required by federal law. 
 
(City of Burbank, supra, 35
Cal.4th at 621, citations, alterations, and internal quotations omitted; see also Sweeney v. California Regional Water Quality
Control Board (2021) 61
Cal.App.5th 1093, 1113 [discussing Porter-Cologne Act].)  
 
C.        Waste Discharge Requirements Order No.
R4-2023-0359
 
The
process of issuing the operative Waste Discharge Requirements (“WDRs”) began in
October 2019. (AR 6835.)  The Board
conducted site visits, published multiple draft “Tentative WDRs” for notice and
comment, and held three public hearings in February 2022, September 2023, and
October 2023. (See AR 4195-874, 5044-49, 5145-410, 5713-6348, 6499-544,
6742-967.)  The final WDRs imposed, among
other things, six requirements that Petitioner challenges in its writ petition:
(1) new effluent limits at Outfalls 001 and 002; (2) new effluent limits for
aluminum; (3) a new monitoring requirement for PCB congeners; (4) new
monitoring requirements for constituents listed in the Department of Toxic
Substances Control’s (DTSC) “Standardized Risk Assessment Methodology” (SRAM)
for SSFL; (5) retained effluent limits from the prior NPDES permit; and (6) new
requirements for groundwater infiltration studies at the Silvernale and R-1
Ponds.  (AR 6748-51, 6805, 6812, 6827,
6860.)
 
On
November 29, 2023, Petitioner filed a petition for review with the State Water
Resources Control Board (the “State Board”), seeking review of these new
requirements.   Petitioner also filed a
request for a stay.  Both were deemed
dismissed by operation of law on February 19, 2024, after the State Board
declined to issue a decision.  (First
Amended Petition 
¶
10.)  This writ petition followed.
 
STANDARD OF
REVIEW
 
The
petition is brought pursuant to Water Code section 13330, which states in
relevant part as follows: 
 
Section 1094.5 of
the Code of Civil Procedure shall govern proceedings for which petitions are
filed pursuant to this section. For the purposes of subdivision (c) of Section
1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the court shall exercise its independent
judgment on the evidence in any case involving the judicial review of … a
decision or order of a regional board for which the state board denies review
under Section 13320. . . .  
 
(Water
Code § 13330(e).)
            
Under
the independent judgment test, “the trial court not only examines the
administrative record for errors of law, but also exercises its independent
judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a limited trial de novo.”  (Bixby v. Pierno (1971) 4 Cal. 3d 130,
143.)  The court “must weigh all the
evidence for itself and make its own decision about which party’s position is
supported by a preponderance. The question is not whether any rational fact
finder could make the finding below, but whether the reviewing court believed
the finding actually was correct.”  (Sweeney
v. California Regional Water Quality Control Bd. (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th
 1093, 1112.)  “In exercising its independent judgment, a
trial court must afford a strong presumption of correctness concerning the
administrative findings, and the party challenging the administrative decision
bears the burden of convincing the court that the administrative findings are
contrary to the weight of the evidence.” 
(Fukuda v. City of Angels
(1999) 20 Cal. 4th 805, 817; accord Atlantic Richfield Co. v. Cal. Reg. Wat.
Quality Control Bd. (2022) 85 Cal.App.5th 338, 353.)  
 
The
court exercises its independent judgment on questions of law arising in mandate
proceedings.  (Christensen v. Lightbourne (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 1239, 1251.)  The interpretation of statute or regulation
is a question of law.  (See State Farm
Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Quackenbush (1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 65,
77.)  “An administrative agency’s
construction of the authority vested in the agency to carry out a statutory
provision is entitled to great weight and will be followed unless it is clearly
erroneous or unauthorized.”  (Monterey
Coastkeeper v. State Water Resources Control Board (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th
342, 363.)  “Greater deference should be
given to an agency’s interpretation where the agency has expertise and
technical knowledge, especially where the legal text to be interpreted is
technical, obscure, complex, open-ended, or entwined with issues of fact,
policy, and discretion.”  (Ibid.)  
 
Petitioner
bears the burden of proof and persuasion in this writ action.  (Strumsky
v. San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn. (1974) 11 Cal.3d 28, 32; Steele v. Los Angeles County Civil Service Commission (1958) 166 Cal.App.2d
129, 137.)  When an appellant
challenges “the sufficiency of the evidence, all material evidence on the point
must be set forth and not merely [its] own evidence.” (Toigo v. Town of Ross
(1998) 70 Cal.App.4th 309, 317.) 
“And in doing so, the challenger cannot simply ignore the evidence in
the record that was relied upon by the board . . . .  Rather, the challenger must explain why that
evidence is insufficient to support that finding.”  (Shenouda
v. Veterinary Medical Board (2018)
27 Cal.App.5th 500, 513.)  A
reviewing court “will not act as counsel for either party to an appeal and will
not assume the task of initiating and prosecuting a search of the record for
any purpose of discovering errors not pointed out in the briefs.”  (Fox v.
Erickson (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d 740, 742.)
 
EVIDENTIARY
ISSUES 
 
            The
Board requests judicial notice of (1) the fact that the PCBs listed in 40
C.F.R., section 136.3, table 1C(88) – (94) (PCB-1016, -1221, -1232, - 1242,
-1248, -1254, and -1260) are Aroclors, not congeners; and (2) tables published
by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) listing known
PCB Aroclors and congeners.  Petitioner
objects to the first request but not the second.  (Reply 12, fn. 6.)  The Board’s first request for judicial notice
is reasonably subject to dispute. 
Accordingly, judicial notice of the first request is DENIED.  (Evid. Code § 452(b).)  The Board’s unopposed request for judicial
notice of the EPA tables submitted as Exhibits A and B, which are part of the
federal regulations, is GRANTED.  
 
Petitioner
requests judicial notice of the publication and contents of a final report by
the EPA dated February 25, 1976 and titled “PCBs in the United States
Industrial Use and Environmental Distribution, Task I.”  The Board filed objections.  Petitioner essentially seeks to augment the
administrative record with evidentiary material from the EPA report.  Petitioner did not comply with Code of Civil
Procedure section 1094.5(e) to augment the record.   Accordingly, Petitioner’s request for
judicial notice is DENIED
 


 
DISCUSSION 
 
A.        The
Paired Outfall Effluent Limits – DENIED 
 
Petitioner contends that the Board violated the
Internal Waste Stream Rule when setting effluent limits at four paired
outfalls, 001 and 011, and 002 and 018. 
(Opening Brief (“OB”) 7-8.)   That
rule provides that “[w]hen permit effluent limitations or standards imposed at
the point of discharge are impractical or infeasible, effluent limitations or
standards for discharges of pollutants may be imposed on internal waste streams
before mixing with other waste streams or cooling water streams.”  (40 C.F.R. § 122.45(h)(1).)  The rule further provides that “[l]imits on
internal waste streams will be imposed only when the fact sheet under § 124.56 sets forth the exceptional circumstances which make such
limitations necessary. . . .”  (40 C.F.R.
§ 122.45(h)(2).) 
 
            1.         Petitioner did not exhaust
administrative remedies 
 
Petitioner did not raise this issue—a violation
of the Internal Waste Stream Rule—during the administrative proceedings and,
therefore, failed to exhaust its administrative remedies.  Exhaustion of administrative remedies is
“a jurisdictional prerequisite to judicial review.”  (Cal. Water Impact Network v. Newhall County Water Dist. (2008) 161
Cal.App.4th 1464, 1489.)  “The doctrine
of exhaustion of administrative remedies precludes judicial review of issues,
both legal and factual, that could have been raised but were not raised, at the
administrative level.”  (Tesoro
Refining & Marketing Co. LLC v. Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control
Board (2019) 42 Cal.App.5th 453, 469.)    
 
            On August 21, 2023, Petitioner argued in written comments
submitted to the Board that establishing effluent limits at Outfalls 001 and
002 would violate a 2006 opinion of the State Water Resources Control Board “because
it places a second compliance point on surface water that is already subject to
effluent limitations” at Outfalls 011 and 018. (AR 6972-73.)[1]  The Board addressed that issue by identifying
the changed circumstances requiring monitoring Outfalls 011/018 and Outfalls
001/002.  (See AR 6857-6860.)  
 
Petitioner further stated that if the Board “believes that
some surface water from industrial areas … may be discharged to Outfalls 001
and 002 that is not treated at Outfalls 011 and 018, then the appropriate
change would be to designate Outfalls 001 and 002 as the compliance points, and
change Outfalls 011 and 018 to be benchmark locations.”  (Ibid.)  In the comment, Petitioner explained the
history of the effluent limitations and the 2006 State Board Order: 
 
In 2006, as in the
current proposed permit, the Regional Board had proposed to impose effluent
limitations on Outfalls 001, 011, 002, and 018. Boeing appealed the permit to
the State Board, which reversed, stating that the Board could impose such
limitations on Outfalls 001 and 002 or Outfalls 011 and 018, but not both…. In
the 2006 Order, the State Board determined that the Regional Board could not
set effluent limitations at the paired outfalls of Outfall 001/011 and 002/018
because of the potential double counting of violations.   
 
(AR
5962.)    
 
In its written and oral comments,
Petitioner never argued that imposing new effluent limits at Outfalls 001 and
002 would violate the Internal Waste Stream Rule.  To the contrary, Petitioner made clear
that it would support maintaining the effluent limitations at Outfalls 011 and
018 and the benchmark limits at Outfalls 001 and 002.  (AR 5962-5964.)  As Petitioner’s representative phrased it at
the Board hearing: “[W]e respectfully ask that the perimeter Outfalls at 1 and
2 remain as benchmark limits.”  (AR
6403.)  Petitioner did not argue that the
Board needed to make findings under Internal
Waste Stream Rule to maintain the effluent limits at Outfalls 011 and 018, even
though they are located at the interior of the site.  (AR 5962-5964, 6403, 6602-6603.)   
 
In reply, Petitioner argues that it
sufficiently raised the issue below because it cited the Clean Water Act in
oral comments before the Board.  (Reply
5-6, citing AR 6604, 6602-6603.) 
Petitioner’s representative stated that “Setting compliance points at
paired outfalls would violate … the State Water Board’s 2006 order and the
Clean Water Act.”  (AR
6602:25-6603:2.)  This general reference
to the Clean Water Act was inadequate to exhaust administrative remedies.  While
Petitioner did not need to specifically cite section 122.45(h) of the federal
regulations in its comments, see Reply 6:7-15, its objections needed to
be “sufficiently specific so
that the agency has the opportunity to evaluate and respond to them.’”  (Sierra Club v. City of Orange (2008) 163
Cal.App.4th 523, 536.)  Petitioner did
not satisfy this standard.  In fact, Petitioner affirmatively
encouraged the Board to maintain the status quo, which consisted of effluent
limits at Outfalls 011 and 018 and only “benchmark limits” at Outfalls 001 and
002.  (AR 5962-5964, 6403, 6602-6603.)[2]
 
Contrary to Petitioner’s assertion, the Board
cited generally to section 122.45(a) in its responses to comments, not the
Internal Waste Stream rule found at section 122.45(h).  (See Reply 6:15-18, citing AR
6973.)  Nor did the Board discuss the Internal
Waste Stream Rule in its findings.  (AR 6857-6860.) 
Thus, Petitioner does not demonstrate that the Board was aware of or
considered a contention that it needed to make findings under the Internal Waste Stream Rule to maintain effluent limits at Outfalls 011 and 018.  Accordingly, Petitioner did not exhaust its
administrative remedies with respect to its new arguments based on the Internal Waste Stream Rule.  This
argument has been forfeited.[3]  
 
            2.         The Internal Waste Stream Rule does not
apply
 
The Clean
Water Act governs “navigable waters” but “does not generally regulate waters
internal to a waste processing system.” 
(See Texas Municipal Power Agency v. Administrator of U.S. E.P.A.,
836 F.2d 1482, 1486 (5th Cir. 1988).) 
The Internal Waste Stream Rule provides an exception which allows the
permitting authority to impose effluent limits “on internal waste streams
before mixing with other waste streams or cooling water streams” when permit
effluent limitations at the point of discharge—the location where a pollutant
is released into the water—would be “impracticable or infeasible.”  (40 C.F.R. § 122.45(h)(1), (2).)  
 
The Board
argues that the Internal Waste Stream Rule does not apply because “although
Outfalls 011 and 018 are geographically upstream of Outfalls 001 and 002, the
evidence establishes that they are not merely points along internal waste
streams that terminate at Outfalls 001 and 002.”  (Oppo. 8-9.) 
The Board is correct.  (See
40 C.F.R. § 122.45(a) [“permit effluent limitations, standards and prohibitions
shall be established for each outfall or discharge point of the
permitted facility”]; see also American Iron and Steel Institute v. E.P.A. (D.C. Cir. 1997)
115 F.3d 979, 995-96 (D.C. Cir. 1997) [“The [Board] may regulate the pollutant
levels in a waste stream that is discharged directly into the navigable waters
of the United States”].)  In its briefing,
Petitioner does not explain why the tributaries or streams within the SSFL site,
which is nearly 3,000 acres, would not be considered navigable waters of the
United States.  (See e.g. AR
71235, Figure 29; AR 6274 [map showing streams within SSFL site]; AR 6262
[picture of a stream].)  Therefore, the
court finds that the Internal Waste Stream Rule does not apply.  
 
            3.         The Board likely complied with the
Internal Waste Stream Rule   
 
In the alternative, the Board likely complied
with the Internal Waste Stream Rule, assuming it applies.  The effluent limits at Outfalls 011 and 018
were included in the prior WDRs, consistent with the State Board’s 2006 Order.  The Regional Board’s current findings also
explain the circumstances requiring effluent limits to be placed at Outfalls
011 and 018.  (AR 6857-6860.)  Originally, “Outfalls
001 and 011 and Outfalls 002 and 018 [were] duplicative because Outfalls 011
and 018 flow[ed] directly to Outfalls 001 and 002, respectively, without any
change in flows or discharge in the interim and with only open space between them.”  (AR 6857.) 
Due to a variety of factors, which are outlined in the final NPDES
permit and response to comment, this changed. 
(See AR 6857-6860.)  Monitoring at
the point of discharge was “impracticable
or infeasible” for the same reasons that supported the initial monitoring of
Outfalls 011 and 018.  For example, the
Board noted: 
 
Effluent
monitoring locations must be representative of the effluent being discharged
into the receiving water(s).  (40 CFR
122.48(b).).  Per U.S. EPA guidance, “[e]ffluent
monitoring locations should be established after all industrial uses and
treatment processes.”  (Permit Writers
Handbook, section 8.1.2.3. p. 8-4).  The
Guidance also states that it is appropriate to require “effluent monitoring …to
provide data to assess the possible impact of the discharge on the receiving
water.”  (Id.)  
 
(AR 6858.) 
These findings may be sufficient to comply with the Internal Waste
Stream Rule, to the extent it applies, especially considering that Petitioner
did not adequately raise the issue below. 
Thus, Petitioner has not shown that the Board prejudicially abused its
discretion, or that the weight of the evidence does not support the Board’s
findings, for effluent limits at outfalls 001 and 011, and 002
and 018.
 
B.        Aluminum
Effluent Limits – DENIED 
 
Petitioner contends that the Board exceeded its
authority in adopting effluent limits on aluminum in the WDRs.  (OB 8-10.) 
Petitioner
does not take issue with the effluent limits selected by the Board for
aluminum.  Rather, Petitioner challenges
the Board’s determination that the aluminum present on site and found through
sampling is “associated with industrial activity” and has a “reasonable
potential” to cause or contribute to an excursion above a State water quality
standard.     
 
Under the Clean Water Act and its implementing
regulations, dischargers must obtain a NPDES permit for any “stormwater
discharge[] . . . associated with industrial activity.” (33 U.S.C. §
1342(p)(2)(B); see also 40 C.F.R. § 122.26(a)(1)(ii) [same].)  Federal regulations define “storm water
discharge associated with industrial activity” to include discharges from areas
“where industrial activity has taken place in the past and significant
materials remain and are exposed to storm water.” (40 C.F.R. § 122.26(b)(14); see
also 40 C.F.R. § 122.26(b)(12) [defining “significant materials”].)  Federal regulations further state that each
NPDES permit “shall” include, among other things, limitations that “control all
pollutants … which the [Board] determines are or may be discharged at a level
which will cause, have the reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an
excursion above any State water quality standard, including State narrative
criteria for water quality.”  (40 C.F.R.
§ 122.44(d)(1)(i).)  “The EPA has interpreted
‘reasonable potential’ to mean ‘some degree of certainty greater than a mere
possibility.’”  (City of Taunton,
Massachusetts v. EPA,
895 F.3d 120, 133 (1st Cir. 2018.)  
 
The federal regulations do not require the
Board do show, for each pollutant contained within a stormwater discharge, that
Petitioner’s former industrial activities deposited that pollutant in a soil at
a level that would itself result in an exceedance of applicable State water
quality standards.  Rather, the Board must
show that the pollutant contained in a stormwater discharge is “associated
with” the former industrial activity at SSFL. 
(40 C.F.R. § 122.26(a)(1)(ii).) 
As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has observed, the
language “discharges associated with industrial activity” is “very broad.”  (Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.
v. U.S. E.P.A. (9th Cir. 1992) 966 F.2d 1292, 1304.)  “The operative word is ‘associated.’ It is
not necessary that storm water be contaminated or come into direct contact with
pollutants; only association with any type of industrial activity is necessary.”  (Ibid.)
 
Here,
the former industrial activities at SSFL included “research, development,
assembly, and testing of rocket engines.”  (AR 6836.)  Aluminum is a known component in solid rocket
propellants and related equipment.  (AR
6979-6980.)  Site records indicate that
ignition sources, including triethylaluminum, were stored, used, or produced in
the “Igniter & Explosive Storage Area” on-site. (AR 71760-61, 71804, 71808,
76911.)  Site records also list aluminum
as a constituent that may have been deposited in soil because of “combustion
and detonation” of chemicals in the burn pit on-site. (AR 74928.)  “The soil sampling results showed that
relatively consistent, low concentrations of metals were detected throughout
the depositional area, with somewhat higher concentrations detected closest to
the burn pit locations, which is consistent with the depositional modeling
results.”  (Ibid.)  Records also indicate that aluminum is
currently used and stored on site, in a covered area with “secondary
containment,” in connection with Petitioner’s stormwater treatment processes.
(AR 2040-41, 2050, 2053, 2058, 2063.)  
 
Petitioner
argues that the record evidence proves that “aluminum in SSFL soil and
stormwater is naturally occurring, not the result of industrial activity.”  Petitioner relies primarily on the 2022/2023
Site-Wide Stormwater Annual Report of the Surface Water Expert Panel (“Expert
Panel”), as well as testimony of Dr. Michael Stenstrom, a member of the Expert
Panel, and Petitioner’s presentation slides from the September 28, 2023,
hearing.  (OB 8-10, citing AR 71235-37,
6599, 36531, 6274, 6397-98.)[4]  Specifically, Appendix C to the Expert
Panel’s report states, in pertinent part:
 
Aluminum
concentrations were detected above the 1 mg/L tentative effluent limit at
Outfall 008 one time in 2022/23. The limit for aluminum is based on the primary
drinking water MCL which assumes a lifetime consumption at that level. 
 
The concentrations
of aluminum in onsite soil samples collected from the top 6 inches were mapped
over the potential soil cleanup areas identified in DTSC Potential
Environmental Impact Report and colored to show ones below the background
threshold yellow and those above purple (4 samples) in Figure 29. This figure
demonstrates that aluminum concentrations in unimpacted soils across site are
no different than aluminum concentrations in soil cleanup areas (orange shaded
areas). As reflected in Figure 29, more than 99.9% of soil samples have
aluminum concentrations below the background threshold value (BTV), which is
further evidence that there are no industrial or impacted soil sources of
aluminum at the site, and therefore aluminum exceedances in stormwater are
likely from natural background soils.
 
(AR
71235.)
 
             At the Board hearing, Dr. Stenstrom similarly
testified as follows: 
 
Three
questions have come up in the past part of the hearing and I wish to comment on
them. The first is the aluminum source. Soil data shows that 99.9-percent of the
samples taken across the site over the years are below the background threshold
for aluminum and Santa Susana Field Laboratory stormwater concentrations in
aluminum are at or below offsite background stormwater concentrations.  And the aluminum to iron ratios further
confirm Santa Susana stormwater, that aluminum is from background soils.
 
(AR 6599.)  Petitioner’s slides for the September 28,
2023, Board hearing similarly state that “Aluminum detected in surface soil
above DTSC approved background at only 4 out of 6,496 samples.”  (AR 6274.) 
Like the Expert Panel’s report, Petitioner’s presentation slides include
a map showing the distribution of aluminum detection at the site.  (Ibid.)  
 
As
the Board argues, the Dr. Stenstrom’s testimony and the Expert Panel’s findings
are not conclusive.  (See Oppo.
11.)  Figures 29 and 30 in the report show
that there was one exceedance of the tentative effluent limit in the 2022/2023
year at Outfall 008, as well as several exceedances at “background
locations.”  Figures 29 and 30 also show
that aluminum was present, albeit below the tentative limit, throughout the
SSFL site.  Significantly, the report
states that “[w]ith only one sample per outfall location this year, there is not
sufficient data to inform spatial trends.” 
In addition, the report acknowledges that “[t]here is less data
available for a source evaluation since aluminum has not been included in
recent stormwater investigations.”  (See
AR 71234-71237.)  
 
             Petitioner argues that the aluminum effluent
limits are not supported by a reasonable potential analysis, or “RPA.”  (OB 9.) 
Even though the tentative WDRs proposed effluent limits on aluminum
based on a RPA, Petitioner did not argue in the administrative proceedings that
the Board’s RPA with respect to aluminum was deficient.  Thus, Petitioner failed to exhaust
administrative remedies for this argument. 
(See AR 5283; Oppo. 12, fn. 6, citing AR 6979, 6397-98, 6603-04;
Reply 11, fn. 5.)  Regardless, Petitioner
does not adequately support its position that the Board did not conduct a
legally sufficient “reasonable potential” analysis.  Pursuant to the federal regulations, the
permit writer must determine if there is a reasonable potential “to cause, or contribute to an
excursion above any State water quality standard, including State narrative
criteria for water quality.”  (See 40
C.F.R. § 122.44(d)(i)-(iii).)  If a
reasonable potential is found, “the permit must contain effluent limits for
that pollutant.”  (40 C.F.R. §
122.44(d)(iii).)  The Board’s findings
state that the aluminum effluent limits are “based on RPA.”  (AR 6860.) 
Specifically, the Board analyzed monitoring data and concluded that a
reasonable potential existed for aluminum “to cause or contribute to an
excursion above an applicable state or federal water quality standard in the
receiving water.” (See AR 6869, 6872-6875.)  Petitioner has not argued that these findings
are deficient, but rather that they are not supported by evidence.  The court disagrees.  There is evidence in the record that supports
these findings.  (See e.g. AR 6872-6875,
6988-6989; see also AR 7258, 9101, 11228, 11979, 22331.)  
 
            Petitioner argues that “the Board
did not actually complete an RPA for aluminum; at least, there is none in the
record.”  (OB 9, citing AR 6920-67,
80264, 80313.)  Petitioner appears to be
correct that certain formal RPAs in the record do not refer to aluminum.  The Board has not argued to the contrary in
opposition.  (Oppo. 12, fn. 6.)  Nevertheless, the Board’s findings state that
RPA was performed for aluminum and other evidence supports those findings.  (AR 6860, 6869, 6872-6875, 6988-6989; see
also AR 7258, 9101, 11228, 11979, 22331.) 
There is a presumption of correctness in the Board’s findings.  Petitioner has not cited any authority that
the RPA must be documented in some specific way.  For instance, Petitioner has not explained
why the Board could not consider testimony and other evidence presented at the
hearings in deciding to add effluent limits for aluminum.  Also, the administrative record is more than
100,000 pages in length and may contain other evidence supporting the Board’s
RPA findings for aluminum.  At the
hearing, Petitioner’s and Board’s counsel should further discuss the evidence
in the record showing that RPA was performed for aluminum.  If the Board did not conduct RPA for
aluminum, that could be grounds to remand for reconsideration.  However, based on the briefing, the court is
not persuaded that the Board did not conduct RPA for aluminum.
 
In
sum, the court concludes that the Board’s findings for adding effluent limits
for aluminum are supported by the weight of the evidence and are not a
prejudicial abuse of discretion.  Based
on the monitoring data, including the exceedances of the tentative limit, as
well as the evidence that aluminum was used on site during industrial
activities, the Board reasonably concluded that aluminum is “associated with”
past industrial activities at the site and that stormwater discharges have a
reasonable potential “to cause,
or contribute to an excursion above any State water quality standard”
with respect to aluminum.  (emphasis
added.)  The Expert Panel’s report and
related evidence from the hearing were not conclusive and, in the court’s
independent judgment, did not require the Board to conclude that the reasonable
potential standard was not met with respect to aluminum.  
 
C.        PCB
Method 1668C – DENIED 
 
The WDRs require Petitioner to monitor for the
presence of PCB congeners in stormwater discharges from the site using EPA
proposed Method 1668C.  (AR 6812.)  Petitioner argues that this monitoring
requirement should be set aside because: (1) Method 1668C is not an “approved”
method under 40 C.F.R. Part 136, and (2) the Board allegedly failed to balance
the benefits and burdens under Water Code section 13267.  (OB 10-14.) 

 
            1.         Additional
factual background on PCBs
 
PCBs are man-made, organic chemicals that
persist in the environment, exposure to which can cause a variety of serious
health conditions.  (AR 36264-65.)  As summarized by the EPA, “PCBs were
previously used in hundreds of industrial and commercial applications
including: electrical, heat transfer and hydraulic equipment; plasticizers in
paints, plastics and rubber products; pigments, dyes and carbonless copy paper;
and other industrial applications. The PCBs used in these products were
chemical mixtures made up of a variety of individual chlorinated biphenyl
components known as congeners. Most commercial PCB mixtures are known in the
United States by their industrial trade names, the most common being Aroclor.”  (Ibid.)  
 
Prior permits had only required Petitioner to
monitor for Aroclors, the commercial mixtures of individual PCB components.  The operative WDRs, for the first time,
require Petitioner to monitor for the individual components of PCBs—known as
congeners—using Method 1668C “for informational purposes.”  (See AR 6812, 6995-96, 36264-65, 77734-35.)  “Part 136 methods [in the
federal regulations] for chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) only measure a mixture of
congeners in seven Aroclors—PCB–1016, PCB–1221, PCB– 1232, PCB–1242, PCB–1248,
PCB–1254, and PCB–1260, while Method 1668C can measure the 209 PCB congeners in
these mixtures.”  (AR 34150; see 40 C.F.R. § 136.3,
Table IC, Nos. 88-94.) 

 
The WDR explains the new monitoring requirement,
in relevant part, as follows: 
 
Monitoring for PCBs as aroclors and PCBs as congeners are
required.  PCBs as aroclors shall mean the sum
of chlorinated biphenyls whose analytical characteristics resemble those of
Aroclor-1016, Aroclor-1221, Aroclor-1232, Aroclor-1242, Aroclor-1248,
Aroclor-1254, and Aroclor-1260, and shall be analyzed using USEPA method 608.3.
 PCBs as
congeners shall be individually quantified (or quantified as mixtures of
isomers of a single congener in coelutions as appropriate) using U.S. EPA
proposed method 1668c or using a high-resolution EPA-approved method. U.S. EPA
recommends that until the proposed Method 1668c for PCBs is incorporated into
40 CFR § 136, Dischargers should use for discharge monitoring reports/State
monitoring reports: … U.S. EPA proposed method 1668c for monitoring data,
reported as 44 congener results, that will be used for informational purposes
to help assess concentrations in the receiving water.
 
(AR 6812, emphasis in original.) 
 
                        2.         The monitoring requirement complies
with federal law
 
Petitioner contends that Method 1668C is
not an EPA-approved test method for PCBs; that the Board did not apply to EPA
for approval to use Method 1668C; and that the federal regulations do not
authorize the use of unapproved testing methods for “informational
purposes.”  Petitioner relies primarily
on 40 C.F.R. section 136.1(a), which states in pertinent part: 
 
The procedures prescribed herein shall,
except as noted in §§ 136.4, 136.5, and 136.6, be used to perform the measurements indicated whenever
the waste constituent specified is required to be measured for:
 
(1) An application submitted to
the Director and/or reports required to be submitted under
NPDES permits or other requests for quantitative or qualitative
effluent data under parts 122 through 125 of this chapter.
 
(40
C.F.R. § 136.1(a), emphasis added.)
 
            Petitioner raises a question of
regulatory interpretation.  “A statute
must be construed in the context of the entire statutory system of which it is
a part, in order to achieve harmony among the parts.”  (People v. Hull (1991) 1 Cal. 4th 266,
272.)   This rule
applies to the interpretation of a regulation. 
(See County of Sacramento v. State Water Resources Control Board
(2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1579, 1586.) 
Here, section 136.1(a) applies only to waste constituents that are
“specified” in “the procedures prescribed herein,” which refers to the testing
procedures set forth in Part 136 of the regulations.  This interpretation is supported by the
tables to section 136.3, which are lists of “approved test procedures.”  Furthermore, section 122.44(i)(1)(iv)(B) of
the federal regulations expressly states that “[i]n the case of pollutants or
pollutant parameters for which there are no approved methods under 40 CFR part
136 … , monitoring shall be conducted according to a test procedure specified
in the permit for such pollutants or pollutant parameters.”  Thus, if a waste constituent is not specified
in the testing procedures, Part 136 does not control.  Instead, when “pollutants covered by the
permit do not have approved test methods, EPA [and the Board] may use ‘a test
procedure specified in the permit.’”  (Natural
Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. U.S. E.P.A., 863 F.2d 1420, 1430 (9th
Cir. 1988), citing 40 C.F.R. § 122.44(i)(1)(iv).)   
 
As
shown in the record and Table IC of section 136.3, the federal regulations only
include testing methods for eight PCBs (PCB-1016, -1221, 1232, -1242, -1248,
-1254, and -1260), all of which are PCB Aroclors, not congeners.  (See AR
34150 and 40
C.F.R. § 136.3, Table IC, Nos. 88-94.) 
Petitioner concedes this in reply when it states that “approved Method
608.3 tests for Aroclors, whereas Method 1668C can test for individual
congeners.”  (Reply 12:12-13.)  Petitioner, who has the initial burden under Code
of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, does not show there is an approved testing
method for congeners in Part 136 of the federal regulations.  
 
Petitioner
argues that “Aroclors are mixtures of congeners” and Methods 608.3 and 1668C
“are two different methods of monitoring for the same pollutant, PCBs.”  (Reply 12-13; see also OB 11-12.)  This argument does not show any error in the
Board’s decision.  Table IC of section
136.3 includes testing methods for eight different PCB Aroclors, which suggests
that each Aroclor mixture should be viewed as a “waste constituent” for
purposes of Part 136.  Since Aroclors are
made up of congeners, and since congeners themselves are PCBs, see AR
34150, 36270, 77734-35, individual congeners are reasonably viewed as “waste
constituents” for which testing methods could be authorized.  Indeed, proposed Method 1668c was created to
test for individual congeners.   
 
Petitioner
contends that the Board lacks authority to require testing for individual
congeners for informational purposes. 
(Reply 12-14; see also OB 11-12.) 
The court is not persuaded.  The
federal regulations on which Petitioner relies, mainly those in Part 136, do
not prohibit monitoring requirements for waste constituents, which are not
specified in the enumerated testing procedures, for informational purposes.  Other sources of law from the Clean Water Act
and Porter-Cologne Act authorize
the Board to impose monitoring requirements. (See 33 U.S.C. §§ 1318(a)(A),
1342(a)(2); Wat. Code § 13383(a).) 
Petitioner acknowledges that these statutes “authorize the Board to
issue monitoring requirements.”  (Reply
14:22-23.)  To illustrate, section 1318
states, in pertinent part: 
 
Whenever required to carry out the
objective of this chapter, including but not limited to (1) developing or
assisting in the development of any effluent limitation, or other limitation,
prohibition, or effluent standard, pretreatment standard, or standard of
performance under this chapter; (2) determining whether any person is in
violation of any such effluent limitation, or other limitation, prohibition or
effluent standard, pretreatment standard, or standard of performance; … (A) the
Administrator shall require the owner or operator of any point source to (i)
establish and maintain such records, (ii) make such reports, (iii) install,
use, and maintain such monitoring equipment or methods (including where
appropriate, biological monitoring methods), (iv) sample such effluents (in
accordance with such methods, at such locations, at such intervals, and in such
manner as the Administrator shall prescribe), and (v) provide such other
information as he may reasonably require.
 
(33
U.S.C. §§ 1318(a)(A).)  
 
This
language is broad and is reasonably interpreted to authorize the Board to
require monitoring for informational purposes that is reasonable and necessary
to carry out the objectives of the Clean Water Act.  In
interpreting the relevant provisions of the Clean Water Act, the D.C. Circuit
has remarked that “[t]he breadth of this statutory grant of authority . . .
justif[ies] broad information disclosure requirements relating to the
[permitting authority’s] duties, as long as the disclosure demands” are “reasonable.”
(Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. U.S. E.P.A., 822 F.2d 104,
119 (D.C. Cir. 1987.)  Section 13383(a)
similarly states, in relevant part, that “[t]he . . . regional board may
establish monitoring … for any person who discharges, or proposes to discharge,
to navigable waters. . . .”  And section
13383(b) states that “the regional boards may require any person subject to
this section to establish and maintain monitoring equipment or methods,
including, where appropriate, biological monitoring methods, sample effluent as
prescribed, and provide other information as may be reasonably required.”  Petitioner also has not advanced any
persuasive interpretation of these statutes under which the Board lacks
authority to impose monitoring, in a NPDES permit, for informational purposes
if the Board finds that such monitoring is reasonable and necessary to achieve
the objectives of the Clean Water Act.  
 
Notably,
Petitioner has not developed a persuasive argument or cited evidence proving
that the Board abused its discretion in determining that PCB monitoring under
Method 1668C, for informational purposes, is reasonable and necessary to
achieve objectives of the Clean Water Act. 
PCBs are man-made, organic chemicals that
persist in the environment, exposure to which can cause a variety of serious
health conditions.  (AR 36264-65.)  Petitioner has not disputed that testing for
PCBs in stormwater from SSFL, which has been included in past permits, is
necessary to comply with the Clean Water Act. 
Method 1668C is a more sensitive test than Method 608.3.  Exercising its independent judgment, the
court finds that the Board reasonably concluded that adding this additional
monitoring requirement to the WDRs for informational purposes furthers the
objectives of the Clean Water Act.
 
 In a footnote, Petitioner alludes to alleged
concerns with the “reliability” of Method 1668C by citing to three US EPA
documents.  (OB 12, fn. 2.)  Contrary to Petitioner’s suggestion, the EPA
has not disclaimed or discredited Method 1668C for use in stormwater permits in
all circumstances.  Rather, the EPA has
acknowledged that “this method is being used in some states in their regulatory
programs . . . with good success,” and that its decision “does not negate the
merits of this method for the determination of PCB congeners in regulatory programs.”
(AR 34150; 77 Fed. Reg. 29757, 29763 (May 18, 2012).)  The EPA has acknowledged that Method 1668C “may
be appropriate and useful in certain situations.” (AR 36269; 88 Fed. Reg.
59662, 59668 (Aug. 29, 2023).)  Moreover,
in comments for the WDRs at issue in this case, an EPA representative stated
that additional PCB monitoring for informational purposes, using Method 1668C,
was appropriate. (AR 6431-32.) Given the EPA representative’s position before
the Board and EPA’s statements that Method 1668C may be appropriate in some
situations, the fact EPA has not formally approved Method 1668C for compliance
purposes does not support Petitioner’s position that the Board prejudicially
abused its discretion in requiring Method 1668C for informational
purposes.  
 
Based on the foregoing, Petitioner does
not show any prejudicial abuse of discretion in the Board’s decision to require Petitioner to monitor for the presence of PCB congeners in
stormwater discharges from the site using EPA proposed Method 1668c for
informational purposes.  Exercising its
independent judgment, the court concludes that the weight of the evidence
supports the Board’s findings and legal conclusions with respect to this
monitoring requirement.  
 
                        3.         Water Code section 13267(b) is not
applicable to PCB monitoring      
 
Petitioner argues
that the Board needed to conduct balancing under Water Code section 13267 in
order to require monitoring with Method 1668C for informational purposes.  (OB 13-14.) 
Pursuant to the Porter-Cologne Act, the Board “may investigate the
quality of any waters of the state within its region.”  (Water Code § 13267(a).)  In its water quality investigations, the Board
“may require that any
person who has discharged, discharges, or is suspected of having discharged or
discharging . . . waste within its region . . . that could affect the quality
of waters within its region shall furnish, under penalty of perjury, technical
or monitoring program reports which the regional board requires.”  (Water Code § 13267(b).)  Section 13267
“makes clear that in order to require a discharger to provide the Board with
any technical report, the Board must (1) provide ‘a written explanation with
regard to the need for the reports’; and (2) ‘identify the evidence that
supports requiring that person to provide the reports.’”  (Sweeney v.
California Regional Water Quality Control Board (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 1093, 1114, citing Water Code 
§ 13267(b)(1).) 

 
However, section
13267 does not apply to the Board’s PCB monitoring requirements.  As discussed, other sources of law from the Clean
Water Act and Porter-Cologne Act
authorize the Board to impose monitoring requirements and methods in an NPDES
permit.  (See 33 U.S.C. 
§§
1318(a)(A), 1342(a)(2); Water Code §§ 13383(a), (b).)  Section 13383 is found in Chapter 5.5 of
Division 7 of the Water Code, which was enacted “for the purpose of adopting
the necessary federal requirements to ensure [California] would obtain EPA
approval to issue NPDES permits.”  (Building
Industry Ass’n of San Diego County v. State Water Resources Control Board
(2005) 124 Cal.App.4th 866, 875 [citation omitted].)  To the extent of any inconsistency, the
provisions in Chapter 5.5 “shall prevail over other provisions in this
division,” which includes section 13267.  (Water Code § 13372(a).)  Sections 13383(a) and (b) permit the Board to
establish “monitoring, inspection, entry, reporting, and recording keeping requirements”
and related “equipment and methods” without complying with section 13267.  (See Water Code 
§§
13383(a), (b).)  The Legislature’s
intention is clear because the next subsection—section 13383(c)—expressly
requires the Board to comply with section 13267 relating to inspections.  (See Water Code § 13383(c).)    
 
Petitioner’s
reliance on City of Burbank v. State Water Resources Control Board (2005)
35 Cal.4th 613 is misplaced.  City of Burbank considered the
following question: “When a regional board issues a permit to a wastewater
treatment facility, must the board take into account the facility’s costs of
complying with the board's restrictions on pollutants in the wastewater to be
discharged?”  (Ibid.)  To answer that question, the Court analyzed
Water Code sections 13263 and 13241 and the federal supremacy clause.  The Court held that “[w]hen … a
regional board is considering whether to make the pollutant restrictions in a
wastewater discharge permit more stringent than federal law
requires, California law allows the board to take into account
economic factors, including the wastewater discharger's cost of
compliance.”  (Id. at 618.)  The Court did not consider or opine on a regional board’s obligations
under Water Code section 13267 in imposing monitoring requirements under a
NPDES permit.  “An opinion
is not authority for propositions not considered.’”  (People v. Knoller (2007) 41 Cal.4th
139, 154-55.)  Accordingly, Petitioner
does not show that the Board was required to make findings under section 13267
for the PCB monitoring at issue.
 
D.        The SRAM Monitoring –
GRANTED IN PART; DENIED IN PART 
 
In the WDRs, the Board imposed new monitoring requirements for “constituents of
potential concern” in the Department of Toxic Substances Control’s
(“DTSC”) “Standardized Risk Assessment Methodology” (“SRAM”) for the SSFL
Site.  (AR 6805.)  Specifically, the WDRs state: 
 
In addition, the Discharger shall conduct
influent monitoring for PFAS and the
additional remaining constituents of potential
concern (COPCs) as identified DTSC for all media in Attachment 1 of Appendix D
of the 2014 Standardized Risk Assessment (SRAM), with updates as identified in
Table 12-1 of Appendix F of the 2022 SRAM. 
 
(Ibid.) 
The WDRs list a series of specific parameters, but the final parameter
merely states: “Additional remaining COPCs for all media as identified in the SRAM.”  (AR 6807.) 
Petitioner contends that the Board prejudicially abused its discretion
because: (1) the Board did not conduct any balancing of benefits and burdens
pursuant to section 13267(b); and (2) the weight of the evidence does not
support the Board’s decision to include all constituents listed
on Table 12-1 of the SRAM in the monitoring requirements.  (OB 14-16.) 
While the Board is permitted to impose these monitoring requirements,
the court finds that the Board did not make the requisite findings to require
monitoring of every chemical listed in Table 12-1.  
 
                        1.         The
Board was not required to comply with section 13267(b)
 
            Petitioner
does not show that the Board was required to comply with section 13267(b) for
these monitoring requirements.  As
discussed above, the Board possesses broad authority independent of section
13267(b) to require monitoring where, as here, the owner of a former industrial
site discharges into waters of the United States.  (See 33 U.S.C. §§ 1318(a)(A), 1342(a)(2); Wat.
Code, § 13383(b); Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. U.S. E.P.A.,
822 F.2d 104, 119 (D.C. Cir. 1987.)
 
                        2.          
The Board did not justify its monitoring requirements 
 
            While
the Board has authority to impose monitoring requirements for every chemical
listed in Table 12-1, the Board failed to justify monitoring for every constituent
listed on Table 12-1 of the SRAM.  The
SRAM, which was prepared for the DTSC by Petitioner’s consultant, “provides updates
to the human health and ecological risk assessment (HHERA) approach, methods,
assumptions and toxicity criteria” to the prior SRAM
(from 2005) for the SSFL site.  (AR
76706.)  “The purpose of the SRAM is to
establish a standardized, regulatory-approved approach to assess the human
health and ecological risk of chemicals that are present in the various
environmental media (e.g., air, soil, water) at the SSFL.”  (AR 76726.) 
“After the risk assessments are completed, the risk assessments will be
used to help identify areas at any investigational unit that are determined to
need remediation.”  (Ibid.)  
 
Table 12-1 of the SRAM provides ecological risk-based screening levels
(“EcoRBSLs”) for chemicals that have been detected in the past at SSFL.  (AR 78284.)  EcoRBSLs are concentrations of chemicals that,
if present at those concentrations, indicate a potential risk to wildlife, thus
warranting further evaluation.  The fact
that SRAM Table 12-1 includes an EcoRBSL for a chemical is not, in itself,
evidence that the chemical poses a risk to health or the environment at
SSFL.  This is because the SRAM and
EcoRBSLs are tools to use for future risk evaluations.  (See AR 76726, 76759-64, 77732-33.)  In its opening brief, Petitioner highlights
the following two examples from SRAM: 
 
Acetic Acid. Acetic Acid is a product of
biodegradation, and is found or produced naturally in most plants and animals.
It is the main acid in vinegars such as white (distilled), cider, balsamic,
malt, red wine, white wine, rice and sherry; at concentrations ranging between
three and eight percent.  The Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) classifies acetic acid as “Generally Recognized as
Safe (GRAS)” under 21 CFR 184.1005 as a direct food substance and under 21 CFR
582.1005 as a general purpose food additive.  Because acetic acid is naturally occurring and
has low risk potential, it is not typically evaluated in HHRAs.
 
….¶¶
 
Titanium. Titanium is widely distributed in the
earth’s crust and is found in almost all living things, rocks, soil, and bodies
of water. Titanium is also widely used for biological applications, e.g., hip
joint replacements, tooth replacements, and sunscreen. The toxicity of titanium
has not yet been quantified, but appears to be low.  Because titanium is naturally occurring, used
in many biological applications, and appears to have low toxicity, it is not
typically evaluated in HHRAs.
 
(AR
77734-35.)
 
            Petitioner contends that “Board
staff initially recommended against monitoring for acetic acid
and other SRAM constituents because they are volatile organic compounds . . .
that are unlikely to be found in stormwater due to their chemical
structures.”  (OB 15:20-22, citing AR
6988 [emphasis added].)  That statement
is not entirely correct.  In the cited
response to comments, the Board staff was responding to a comment that many
“toxic chemicals detected at SSFL are exempted from enforceable limits.”  (AR 6988 [emphasis added].)  The Board staff noted that, for those
chemicals that do not have effluent limits, “there are comprehensive monitoring
and reporting requirements in the revised tentative Order to ensure that there
are no impacts to human health or the environment.”  The Board’s staff further noted that, in
response to comments, the Board revised the WDRs to require monitoring of all
“COPCs for all media not already regularly monitored by this permit.”  (AR 6988-89.) 
As the Board points out, the decision to impose these additional
monitoring requirements was informed by public concern that pollutants
identified by DTSC at the site were unregulated by the NPDES permit.  (See, e.g., AR 4470, 4480, 4597, 4808,
6114, 6162.)  The Board concluded this
monitoring was needed to determine whether the SRAM chemicals are also present
in stormwater discharges and, if so, at what concentrations. (See AR
6594:2-14, 6805, 6989.)
 
            Exercising
its independent judgment, the court concludes that the Board has broad
authority to impose monitoring requirements necessary to achieve the purposes
of the Clean Water Act.  To that end, the
Board has discretion to require monitoring for chemicals and potential pollutants
identified in the SRAM and that could be discharged from the site.  Indeed, many constituents from the SRAM were
already subject to monitoring requirements in the prior WDRs.  (See Reply 16:7-15; see also AR
6988-89, 6811, 6815, 7008.)
 
However,
the Board did not include any findings to support its decision to include all constituents listed on Table 12-1 of the SRAM
in the monitoring requirements, including chemicals like acetic acid and
titanium that are “naturally
occurring” and “low toxicity.”  (See AR
6805-07 [Board findings]; see also AR 77734, 77757, 78285, 77735.)  Indeed, the Board did not clearly identify
the chemicals subject to the new requirement. 
In the WDRs, the Board simply required monitoring for “[a]dditional
remaining COPCs for all media as identified in the SRAM,” without specifying
whether it was referring to all chemicals on Table 12-1 or only some.  (AR 6807.) 
This lack of clarity is demonstrated in the Board’s opposition to the
motion to stay, which stated that “titanium has been removed from the list of
chemicals of potential concern.” 
(Opposition filed March 29, 2024, at 16, fn. 5.)  However, in its opposition for the writ
hearing, the Board has not argued that acetic acid
and titanium were removed from the new monitoring requirements.  This lack of clarity also is problematic because
it is unclear why some of the COPC require monitoring. For example, the record
contains no evidence that acetic acid or titanium—which are “naturally occurring”
and “low toxicity”—may be present in large enough quantities at SSFL to pose
any risk to health or the environment. 
The Board has not identified any such evidence in its opposition and appears
to concede the point.  (See Oppo.
17:7-18; Sehulster Tunnels/Pre-Con v.
Traylor Brothers, Inc. (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1328, 1345, fn. 16 [failure
to address point is “equivalent to a concession”].)  
 
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5(b), an abuse of discretion is
established if the decision is not supported by the findings.  (Topanga
Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles, (1974) 11 Cal. 3d
506, 515.)  Here, the court concludes
that the Board’s findings are deficient in that the Board did not identify the
additional “CPOCs” subject to the monitoring or make sufficient findings to
include all constituents
listed on Table 12-1 of the SRAM.  Accordingly, the matter must
be remanded for the Board to make adequate findings, i.e., to identify
which of the constituents listed on Table 12-1 require monitoring and to make sufficient
findings to support the decision.  (See
West Chandler Blvd. Neighborhood Ass’n v. City of Los Angeles (2011) 198
Cal.App.4th 1506, 1521-23.)  
 
The
court’s decision to set aside the monitoring of chemicals in Table 12-1 applies
only to “[a]dditional remaining COPCs for all media as identified in the SRAM”
and does not disturb the monitoring requirements of any chemical specifically
identified in Table E-2 (e.g., cobalt, fluoride, etc.) or of any chemical
subject to monitoring through a different WDR (e.g., aluminum, etc.)  In other words, this ruling applies only to chemicals
list in Table 12-1 that are not identified elsewhere in the WDRs or otherwise subject
to monitoring.  (See AR 6742-6971.)   
 
E.         Effluent
Limits at Outfall 008 – GRANTED  
 
Petitioner
contends that “[t]he Board abused its discretion by retaining effluent limits
for five constituents (antimony, nickel, selenium, thallium, and TCDD) at
Outfall 8, despite having found that these five constituents have no reasonable
potential to cause or contribute to water quality exceedances.”  (OB 16.) 
Petitioner relies on evidence that the Board staff performed new RPAs
for antimony, nickel, selenium, thallium, and TCDD at Outfall 008, and
concluded in the tentative WDRs that there was not a reasonable potential for
these constituents to cause or contribute to violations of water quality
standards.  (AR 5283, 5297-98, 5306-07,
5310-11.)  The Board acknowledged this
evidence in its findings and found it to be true.  (AR 6863, 6874-75.)  
 
Nevertheless,
the Board decided to retain effluent limits for antimony, nickel, selenium,
thallium, and TCDD at Outfall 008.  (See
AR 6863-6864.)  The Board’s findings
state: 
 
In
addition to WQBELs based on reasonable potential, this permit carries over effluent
limitations from the previous permit, notwithstanding recent data
indicating that there was no RPA for these constituents.  CWA section 301(b)(1)(C) requires NPDES permits
to establish effluent limitations as necessary to meet water quality standards.
40 C.F.R. section 122.44(d) sets forth a process for deriving
pollutant-specific effluent limits when the permitting authority determines
that a particular pollutant has the reasonable potential to cause or contribute
to an exceedance of water quality standards. This section establishes minimum
requirements for imposing pollutant-specific WQBELs. However, 40 C.F.R. section
122.44(d) “does not set forth an exclusive process for imposing WQBELs.” (City
& Cnty. of San Francisco v. U.S. Env’t Prot. Agency (9th Cir. 2023) 75
F.4th 1074, 1092) Section 301 of the CWA, authorizes the permitting authority
to include “any more stringent limitation, including those necessary to meet
water quality standards, treatment standards, or schedules of compliance,
established pursuant to any State law or regulations.” To that end, the Permit
Writers Manual includes a number of ways to identify pollutants of concern in
effluent, only one of which is the pollutant being specifically identified in
monitoring data. Pollutants of concern can also be identified through
applicable TBELs, TMDL WLAs, and, because they were previously identified as
needing WQBELS in the previous Permit. (See discussion on pp 6-13 to 6-15 of
the NPDES Permit Writers’ Manual, EPA-833-K-10-001 (2010).)
 
(AR
6863-6864.)  The Board did not provide a
sufficient basis for this decision in its findings.   (See ibid.)  Petitioner argues persuasively that the
authorities cited by the Board in this part of the Fact Sheet do not, in
themselves, support the Board’s decision to retain effluent limits
“notwithstanding recent data indicating that there was no RPA for these
constituents.”  (OB 17-18.)  The Board does not meaningfully respond in
its opposition and concedes the point. 
(Oppo. 17-18; see Sehulster
Tunnels/Pre-Con v. Traylor Brothers, Inc. (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1328,
1345, fn. 16 [failure to address point is “equivalent to a concession”].)
 
            Counsel for the Board attempts to
rely on individual Board members’ comments during the hearing that: (1) There is
a possibility that SSFL stormwater discharges could exceed water quality
standards for the five challenged effluent limits because of climate change, i.e.,
constituents not detected today may nevertheless occur in the future, meaning
that the current data does not provide a sufficient “track record;” and (2) Substantial
time and resources would be required to re-adopt these effluent limits in exceedances
were observed in the future.  These could
constitute valid reasons to adopt the monitoring requirement, notwithstanding
the absence of these constituents, provided that they are supported by
sufficient evidence.  But the Board’s
counsel does not show—with record citations—that the Board, as a body, adopted these
rationales as reasons to retain the effluent limits (i.e., neither of
these reasons is contained within the Board’s findings; nor is there any
adoption of these comments by at least three board members at the hearing).  Even if so, there are no findings from which the
court can assess the reasonableness of the Board’s decision.   The Board’s counsel cites no legal authority
suggesting that individual board members’ comments at the hearing may be used
to justify the Board’s decision.  
 
            The court also is concerned that the
Board may have believed it was required to maintain these monitoring requirements
under the “anti-backsliding” rule.  The Clean
Water Act contains a general prohibition against “backsliding,” i.e.,
when a permit holder applies to the Board for renewal, the Board may not issue
a renewed permit that “contain[s] effluent limitations which are less stringent
than the comparable effluent limitations in the previous permit.” (33 U.S.C. §
1342(o)(1).)  However, there are
exceptions to the anti-backsliding rule. 
The statute provides that the permit “may be renewed,
reissued, or modified to contain a less stringent effluent limitation
applicable to a pollutant” if one of several listed exceptions are
satisfied.  (33 U.S.C. 
§
1342(o)(2) [emphasis added].)  As
relevant there, there is no prohibited backsliding where new information “which
was not available at the time of permit issuance … would have justified the
application of a less stringent effluent limitation at the time of permit
issuance.”  (40 C.F.R. 
§
122.44(l)(2)(i)(B).)  Second, there is no
prohibited backsliding where the receiving water is not impaired for the
pollutant at issue, and revising the limit is consistent with the state’s
antidegradation policy. (33 U.S.C. § 1313(d)(4).)    
 
Based
upon the foregoing, the Board’s findings in this regard are deficient and do
not support the decision.  (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 1094.5(b); Topanga Assn. for a Scenic
Community v. County of Los Angeles, (1974) 11 Cal. 3d 506, 515.)  The court will remand the matter to the Board
to reconsider the decision to retain effluent limits for antimony, nickel,
selenium, thallium, and TCDD at Outfall 008. 
(See AR 6863, 6874-75.) 
This order shall not preclude the Board from retaining the effluent
limits at issue, provided that the Board makes appropriate findings that are
supported by sufficient evidence.  
 
            E.         The
Pond Infiltration Studies – DENIED 
 
The
WDRs impose new requirements for groundwater infiltration studies at the
Silvernale and R-1 Ponds.  Section 13267 “makes clear that in order to
require a discharger to provide the Board with any technical report, the Board
must (1) provide ‘a written explanation with regard to the need for the
reports’; and (2) ‘identify the evidence that supports requiring that person to
provide the reports.’”   (Sweeney v. California Regional Water Quality
Control Board (2021) 61
Cal.App.5th 1093, 1114, citing Water Code § 13267(b)(1).)  The Board’s findings comply with these
requirements.  The WDRs include the
following findings pursuant to Water Code section 13267 in support of the pond
infiltration studies:
 
The
Monitoring and Reporting Program includes a requirement pursuant to Water Code
section 13267(b)(1) for the Discharger to evaluate the infiltration rates at Silvernale
and R-1 ponds. The purpose of this study is to determine the potential impacts
of stormwater runoff constituents of concern on groundwater.  This Order also requires the Discharger to
conduct a design feasibility study to determine any modifications to the ponds
that may be necessary to mitigate impacts of infiltration of constituents of
concern in stormwater discharges.  Water
Code section 13267(b)(1) authorizes the regional board to require “any person
who has discharged, discharges, or is suspected of having discharged or
discharging, or who proposes to discharge waste . . . that could affect the
quality of waters within its region shall furnish, under penalty of perjury,
technical or monitoring program reports which the regional board requires.”  Silvernale and R-1 Ponds are multifunctional BMPs
that collect stormwater prior to treatment at the SWTSs.  Treated stormwater from these ponds is
discharged from Discharge Points 011 and 018.  These ponds are unlined. Available evidence on
the underlying soil lithology indicates that stormwater collected in the ponds
is likely to infiltrate to groundwater at a low rate. While the rate is
possibly minimal, uncertainty remains with respect to the type of pollutants
that may be detected in the pond water. There is significant community concern
that constituents of potential concern identified as part of the Site cleanup
overseen by DTSC in other media (e.g., soil or groundwater) may be present.
Therefore, the Los Angeles Water Board has determined that it needs additional
information on the suspected discharge to groundwater of these constituents
through infiltration and design studies. The Discharger may utilize already
available information that is currently being collected by the surface or
groundwater expert panel or other federal, state, or local agencies to support
or augment these studies. Based on the Los Angeles Water Board’s
experience overseeing and reviewing these types of studies through oversight of
permits and contracts, the estimated cost to prepare these reports could range
from $30,000 to $300,000. The burden, including the costs of
these reports, bears a reasonable relationship to the need for the reports for
myriad reasons, including but not limited to: the scale of historic industrial
activity at the Site, ongoing public health concerns in the community, the
toxic and hazardous nature of the substances that were historically used and
remain in the soils at the Site, and the protracted clean-up of the Site.
Further, the Discharger may reduce its costs by submitting any readily
available information from existing data sources and groundwater monitoring,
where available, to complete these studies.
 
(AR
6907-08, emphasis added.)  
 
            Petitioner contends that the Board’s
findings for imposing the pond infiltration studies are not supported by the
weight of the evidence.  The court
disagrees.  The Board heard from
concerned members of the public that stormwater containing pollutants (of known
and unknown identity) was being diverted into unlined ponds on-site, prior to
treatment. (See AR 4713, 4717-18, 4736, 6381:17-20, 6387:4-9, 6416:19-23, 6447:3-12,
6469:6- 17, 6991-92, 7001-02, 7005, 7018.)  While some evidence presented to the Board
showed that infiltration was “minimal,” this evidence did not establish that
infiltration was non-existent. (See AR 6595, 6599, 6602.)  
 
Petitioner
has not raised any argument concerning the burdens of conducting the pond
infiltration studies.  Instead, Petitioner
cites testimony of Dr. Michael Stenstrom, a member of the Expert Panel, that
“the infiltration rate at Silvernale is essentially zero” and that the “majority”
of the contaminants of concern at the ponds are “particulates” that do not
migrate downward through soil to groundwater. 
(AR 6599.)  In its October 2023
report, the Expert Panel also opined as follows: 
 
[T]hese modeling
analyses and field measurements confirm that stormwater infiltration in the
ponds is very low at SSFL. Furthermore, the constituents in stormwater that
occasionally exceed the NPDES permit’s water quality standard-based limits and
benchmarks (e.g., iron, manganese, lead, and dioxins) are predominately in
particulate form, which minimizes their downward migration as they are filtered
and sorbed by sediments and decomposing organic materials in the ponds, and
soils in the underlying vadose zone. Additionally, no analytes were detected
above CA Primary drinking water MCLs in the untreated influent samples
collected from Silvernale and R-1 ponds in 2022/23.
 
(AR
71076-77.)  This evidence was not
conclusive.  Neither Dr. Stenstrom nor
the Expert Panel opined that infiltration at the ponds was non-existent.  Nor did they show that constituents of
concern could not migrate into groundwater from the pond.  Dr. Stenstrom opined that “the majority
of the stormwater contaminants of concern in these ponds are particulate, so
they don't migrate through groundwater.” 
(AR 6599, emphasis added.)  The
Expert Panel stated that “the constituents in stormwater that occasionally
exceed the NPDES permit’s water quality standard-based limits and benchmarks …
are predominately in particulate form.”  (AR 71076-77, emphasis added.)  They did not opine that all constituents of
concern that enter the ponds could not migrate to groundwater.  
 
            Petitioner
also cites evidence that a representative of DTSC, the lead agency for
groundwater cleanup at SSFL, testified that the ponds will be included as part
of the DTSC-supervised Sitewide cleanup, which is still in the planning
stages.  (AR 6606-09.)  Regional Board also staff testified that
“staff do not recommend a renewed Groundwater Infiltration Study at this time,”
based on the Expert Panel’s work and DTSC’s ongoing action at the ponds.  (AR 6387-88.) 
The staff explained, “an investigation of groundwater contamination is
ongoing and disturbing sediments will interfere with DTSC’s investigation and
could exacerbate conditions further.” (Ibid.)  However, the Board’s staff acknowledged that
an “Infiltration Study may be warranted” as clean-up efforts progress.  (Ibid.) 
 
Exercising its
independent judgment, the court concludes that this evidence does not support
Petitioner’s position that the Board abused its discretion.  On questioning from the Board, the DTSC
representative acknowledged that the constituents contaminating in and around
the ponds “are the typical ones that we would see throughout the, the Santa
Susana site” including “metals, PCBs, VOCs … dioxins.”  (AR 6606-07.) 
She acknowledged that remediation of the ponds will require soil
excavation and removal and that this process would start in around three
years.  (Ibid.)  Although the Board’s staff expressed concerns
about interference with DTSC’s cleanup activities, Petitioner does not show, by
record citation, that the pond infiltration studies could not be designed in a
way to avoid interference.  Further, the
WDRs state that “[t]he Discharger may utilize already available information
that is currently being collected by the surface or groundwater expert panel or
other federal, state, or local agencies to support or augment these studies.”  (AR 6908.) 
Thus, Petitioner has discretion to design the study in a manner that
utilizes, and does not interfere with, work of the Expert Panel and other
agencies.  
 
Exercising its
independent judgment on the record, the court concludes that the Board’s
findings for imposing the pond infiltration studies are supported by the weight
of the evidence.  Given that the ponds
are unlined, the undisputed need for remediation by DTSC, the time it will take
for DTSC remediation to begin, and the uncertainty as to whether pollutants associated
with prior industrial activity were present in stormwater flowing into the
ponds, and, if so, at what concentrations, the Board reasonably concluded that the
burdens to Petitioner of conducting a study to assess the rate of infiltration
of contaminants of potential concern in stormwater runoff, and their potential
to impact groundwater at SSFL, were reasonably related to the benefits. (AR
6807-08, 6635.)  
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER 
 
            Based
upon the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
            1.         The petition for writ of administrative
mandate is granted in part and denied in part. 

 
            2.         The court issues the writ with respect
to the “[a]dditional
remaining COPCs for all media as identified in the SRAM.”  This order shall not disturb the monitoring
requirements of any chemical specifically identified in Table E-2 or any chemical
subject to monitoring through a different WDR. 
In other words, this ruling applies only to chemicals list in Table 12-1
that are not identified elsewhere in the WDRs. 

 
            3.         The
court issues the writ with respect to monitoring
for antimony,
nickel, selenium, thallium, and TCDD at Outfall 008.  
 
            4.         The
court remands the matter to the Board to set aside these requirements and to
reconsider them in light of this court’s decision and judgment.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5(f).) The court’s
decision and judgment “shall not limit or control in any way the discretion
legally vested in [the Board].”  (Ibid.)  In other words, this order shall not prevent
the Board from re-imposing these requirements, provided the Board makes
sufficient findings.
 
            5.         The
petition for writ of mandate is otherwise denied.
 
            6.         The
court lifts the stay it previously imposed.
 
            7.         The
