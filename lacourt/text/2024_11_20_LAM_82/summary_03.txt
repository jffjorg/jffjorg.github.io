And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is reviewing Petitioner's arguments against the Board's decision to add effluent limits at Outfalls 001 and 002. Petitioner argued that the new permit should not establish effluent limitations for these outfalls because effluent limitations were previously imposed at Outfalls 011 and 018. The judge concludes that Petitioner's representative did not exhaust administrative remedies and did not argue that the Board needed to make findings under the Internal Waste Stream Rule. The judge also finds that Petitioner's argument about paired outfall effluent limits is not viable because it was raised for the first time in reply and has not shown good cause to raise it. The judge concludes that the Board's decision is valid and that remand is not required.
