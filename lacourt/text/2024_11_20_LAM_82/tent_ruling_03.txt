[1] The comment
initially stated that there were already effluent limitations at “Outfalls 001
and 018,” but then clarified that the prior order imposed effluent limitations
at Outfalls 011 and 018.  For that
reason, Petitioner argued that the new WDRs “should not establish” effluent
limitations for Outfalls 001 and 002. 
(AR 5961-5962.)


[2] Petitioner’s
representative did state, in rebuttal, that “moving the compliance monitoring
points to Outfalls 001 and 002 would be consistent with the USEPA’s NPDES
Permit Writer's Manual, which states that ‘internal monitoring is generally not
appropriate … unless final effluent monitoring is impractical.’”  (AR 6603.) 
This comment also was not sufficient to exhaust administrative remedies.  Petitioner’s representative
referred to the NPDES
Permit Writer’s Manual only to support the position that the new permit should
impose effluent limits either at Outfalls 011 and 018, or Outfalls 001 and 002,
but not both sets.  Petitioner’s
representative did not argue that the Board needed to make any findings under
the Internal Waste Stream Rule.
 


[3] Petitioner also
forfeited its argument, first made in reply, that “the paired outfall effluent
limits are an abuse of discretion, because they create an unreasonable risk of duplicate
enforcement and are contrary to the State Board’s 2006 Order.”   (Reply 7, fn. 1.)  Petitioner does not show good cause to raise
this argument for the first time in reply. 
(See Balboa Ins. Co. v.
Aguirre (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 1002, 1010.) 
Alternatively, exercising its independent judgment, the court concludes
that Petitioner has not shown a prejudicial abuse of discretion.  The
Board adequately explained the reasons that it added effluent limits at
Outfalls 001 and 002 and that it will not seek duplicate enforcement.  (AR 6857-6860.)

The Expert
Panel’s report was apparently issued on October 31, 2023, after the Board’s
final hearing on October 19, 2023.  (See
Court’s Order dated July 31, 2024 at 11; O’Rourke Decl. filed July 3, 2024
¶ 7.)  The court concludes that the
Expert Panel’s report, while relevant, is cumulative of other evidence,
including the testimony of Dr. Stenstrom and Petitioner’s presentation slides,
that were considered by the Board.  (See
AR 6599, 6274.)  Thus, remand for the
Board to consider the Expert Panel’s report is not required.
