Here is a brief English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the City of Los Angeles's motion to quash the depositions of former LAPD Chief Michel Moore and Assistant Inspector General Django Sibley, or in the alternative, motion for a protective order. The judge finds that Michel Moore is not a sufficiently high-ranking official to invoke the "apex witness" rule, and that the purpose underlying the rule does not apply to a former official. The judge also denies the City's argument that the deliberative process privilege or "mental process doctrine" applies, finding that the public interest in disclosure outweighs the City's interest in nondisclosure.
