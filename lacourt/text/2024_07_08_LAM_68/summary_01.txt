The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel further responses to request for production of documents, numbers 4, 9, and 12 from the plaintiff. The plaintiff's responses consisted of references to other items, which is deemed an improper and factually incomplete answer. The judge orders the plaintiff to serve complete and responsive responses within 30 days. The court has reserved the right to set an OSC re: Discovery Referee in lieu of a hearing on any given motion. The judge also invites the parties to continue meeting and conferring, including the provision of supplemental responses, when possible.
