And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to special interrogatories and request for production of documents from the defendant, GG LA Figueroa, LLC. The court consolidates the two motions into a single ruling and finds that the motion is moot since the plaintiff has acknowledged receipt of responses to the discovery requests. However, the court finds that the responses were late and imposes sanctions on the defendant and its counsel in the amount of $1,250. The court also sets the motions for summary judgment and protective order for July 16 and 23, 2024, respectively.
