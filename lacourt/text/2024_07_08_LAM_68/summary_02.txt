And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the application for an order allowing the forced sale of the dwelling at 1032 North Dudley Street, Pomona, CA, without prejudice. The application was submitted by the judgment creditors, Luiz Meono and Ricardo Meono, who are seeking to collect a judgment debt of $270,406.54 against the judgment debtors, Miguel Lopez and Rosalio Granados.

The court has determined that the judgment creditors failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claim that the dwelling is not the primary residence of Miguel Lopez, and therefore cannot be considered a homestead. The court has also declined to make a factual finding of a homestead exemption based on a declaration from a judgment creditor without a factual showing of support.

The court has noted that the judgment debtors have failed to vacate the default judgment, and therefore lack capacity to oppose the subsequent default judgment prove-up related hearing. The court has also stated that it cannot consider any declaration from Lopez for purposes of the subject motion.

The court has ordered the judgment creditors to give notice of the denial of their application. The case will be set for further hearing if the judgment creditors can provide sufficient evidence to support their claim that the dwelling is not the primary residence of Miguel Lopez.
