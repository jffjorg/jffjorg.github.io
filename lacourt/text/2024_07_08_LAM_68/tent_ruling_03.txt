On January 31, 2023, Plaintiff sought to enter the premises of a “restaurant” (Cold Stone Creamery) owned and/or operated by Defendants, but maintains non-compliant counters and tables to accommodate protected persons entering public establishments.On June 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a verified complaint for Violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Violation of the Unruh Act. On July 14, 2023, an answer was filed by Marlan Cooper, presumably in pro per, and purportedly on behalf of Maresp Corporation. On July 21, 2023, GG LA Figueroa, LLC, filed a verified answer to the complaint. On August 29, 2023, a default was entered against Maresp Corporation.On October 13, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer to the answer of GG LA Figueroa, LLC, and denied the. motion to strike. GG LA Figueroa, LLC filed an amended answer on November 3, 2023. On January 16, 2024, GG LA Figueroa, LLC filed a cross-complaint against both Cold Stone Creamery, Inc. and Maresp Corporation for Express Contractual Indemnity, Implied Indemnity, and Declaratory Relief.On November 15, 2023, the action was transferred from the personal injury hub court to Department 55. Plaintiff filed a 170.6 challenge thereby leading to reassignment to Department 36. All hearings were vacated in a series of orders from both Departments 55 and 36. On December 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed a SECOND 170.6, which was accepted, and the case was transferred to Department 68.RULING: Moot/Denied.Plaintiff Dwain Lammey moves to compel responses to special interrogatories (set one) and request for production of documents (set one) from Defendant GG LA Figueroa, LLC. The court consolidates the two motions into a single ruling.Plaintiff served the subject discovery on December 13, 2023. [Declaration of Dennis Price, ¶¶ 2-3, Ex. A-B.] According to Plaintiff, at the time of the filing of the motion, no responses were received. [Id., ¶ 9.] Defendants GG LA Figueroa and Cold Stone Creamery Inc. in joint opposition accuse Plaintiff and counsel of “fraud on the court” based on “falsehoods” in the operative complaint and the July 16, 2024, motion for summary judgment, due to the “pretense” of Plaintiff visiting the site only to facilitate an Americans with Disability Act claim rather than actually patronize the store. It’s not actually clear from said opposition how said opinions on the action in any way address the served discovery and lack of responses. Plaintiffs in reply reiterates the lack of any actual discovery responses. Plaintiff also filed a “surreply,” whereby Plaintiff ackowledges service of “deficient responses,” including a substantive challenge to the merits of the responses."Whether a particular response does resolve satisfactorily the issues raised by a motion is a matter best determined by the trial court in the exercise of its discretion, based on the circumstances of the case. In many cases involving untimely responses, the propounding party will take the motion off calendar or narrow its scope to the issue of sanctions. If the propounding party proceeds with the motion, however, the trial court has the discretion to rule on the motion. The trial court might compel responses without objection if it finds no legally valid responses have been provided to one or more interrogatories; it might deny the motion to compel responses as essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part, and just impose sanctions; it might treat the motion as one under section 2030.300 and either determine that further answers are required, or order the propounding party to “meet and confer” (§ 2030.300, subd. (b)) and file a separate statement (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1020(a)(2), (c)); or it might take the motion off calendar, thereby requiring the propounding party to file a motion under section 2030.300.”(Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 408–409.)Given the acknowledgment of responses, the motion to compel initial responses is therefore denied as moot. The court declines to engage in any motion to compel further responses, especially based on the sur-reply.The apparently late responses, e.g. filed after the motion, however, supports the imposition of sanctions. Sanctions in the amount of $1,250, which includes the $1,000 statutory minimum required for request for production of documents, plus $250 for special interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.050, subd. (a), 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c), 2033.280, subd. (c).) Sanctions payable in 30 days and imposed jointly against responding party and counsel.Motions for summary judgment and protective order and set for July 16 and 23, 2024, respectively.Plaintiff to give notice.
