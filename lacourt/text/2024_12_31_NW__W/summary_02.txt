And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the complaint is sustained with leave to amend. The defendants, Bagrad Petrosian, Armine Z. Petrosian, and Bagrad Petrosian & Armine Z. Petrosian, Trustees of the Bud & Armine Petrosian Trust U/D/T Dated 7/17/06, argued that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against them. The judge agrees with the defendants, stating that the complaint is unclear about whether the defendants had prior knowledge of the dog's vicious nature and failed to control their property. Additionally, the complaint does not allege which defendants owned the dog, owned the property, and who allowed the dog to roam free. The judge has given the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to address these issues.
