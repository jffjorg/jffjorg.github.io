And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to his requests for production, set one. The plaintiff had requested that the defendant produce specific documents related to the lemon law action, including documentation of repairs and inspections. The defendant's responses were deemed insufficient, and the plaintiff argued that the defendant was withholding documents that were directly relevant to the case. The court found that the defendant's general objections had been waived, and that the plaintiff's requests were proper. The court ordered the defendant to produce all responsive documents, including any records of repairs made to the vehicle prior to or after the plaintiff took possession of it. The court also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant in the amount of $6,285.00, as neither party's position was without substantial justification.
