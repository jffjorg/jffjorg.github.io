BACKGROUND
 
This is a lemon law action. On January 17, 2023, Plaintiff Walter
Baneggas filed a complaint against Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC, Galpin
Jaguar Lincoln-Mercury, Inc. dba Jaguar Van Nuys/Land Rover Van Nuys for Violation
of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty. Plaintiff purchased a 2018
Lan Rover Range Rover Velar. Plaintiff alleges they delivered the vehicle to an
authorized repair facility for nonconformities, but Defendants were unable to
conform the subject vehicle to the applicable express warranty after a reasonable
number of repair attempts. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Compliance with the Court’s Order Dated
September 5, 2024 and Request for Monetary Sanctions is granted. 
 
discussion
 
Plaintiff Waler
Baneggas moves the court for an order compelling Defendant Jaguar Land Rover
North America, LLC (“JLRNA”) to comply with this court’s September 5, 2024
Order ordering Defendant JLRNA to produce (1) the Franchise Agreement between
itself and Land Rover Encino in effect on January 28, 2021 (only as to sections
that relate to handling of warranties, repairs and customer complaints); and
(2) documents responsive to RFP No. 45 (but only as to California, same make,
model and defect). Plaintiff also moves this court for an order awarding
monetary sanctions against Defendant and its law firm for Defendant’s willful
and intentional defiance of the Court’s September 5, 2024 Order.
 
If a party fails to
obey a court order compelling it to provide a discovery response, “the court
may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue
sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction . . . In lieu of or
in addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction….” (CCP
§ 2031.300(c).) Misuse of the discovery process, including disobeying a court
order compelling discovery, is grounds for sanctions. (CCP §
2023.010(g).)  Moreover, every court has the power “[t]o compel
obedience to its judgments, orders, and process, and to the orders of a judge
out of court, in an action or proceeding pending therein.” (CCP § 128(a)(4).)
 
Plaintiff argues on
September 5, 2024, this court issued a final order granting Plaintiff’s
Discovery Motion in part, including ordering Defendant to provide further
verified responses and responsive documents to RFPs 18 (only as to sections
that relate to handling of warranties, repairs and customer complaints) and 45
(only as to California, same make, model and defect), no later than 30 days
after the date of the Order. (Thomas Decl. ¶9.) On October 16, 2024, Plaintiff
emailed Defendant asking whether they were going to comply with the Court’s
September 5, 2024 Order, to which Defendant stated that it would provide its responses
on October 23, 2024. (Thomas Decl. ¶10, Exh. C.) On October 23, 2024, Defendant
provided supplemental responses to Plaintiffs’ RFPs 18 and 45, stating that it
would produce documents subject to a protective order. (Thomas Decl. ¶11.)
However, Defendant failed to include the protective order. (Thomas Decl. ¶11.)
A few days later, Plaintiff confirmed receipt and stated it was willing to sign
a protective order but Defendant never did. (Thomas Decl. ¶12, Exh. D.)  
 
In opposition,
Defendant claims this motion is now moot. Defendant did provide the further
responses on October 23, 2024 and on December 17, 2024, the parties agreed to
stipulate to the Los Angeles Superior Court Model Protective Order and produce
the outstanding documents by December 31, 2024. (Cho Decl. ¶3, Exh. 5.) The
parties also agreed to change the current hearing date on this matter. (Cho
Decl. ¶3, Exh. 5.) However, Defendant states they could not change the hearing
date from December 31, 2024 because it is only the moving party who can change
the hearing date through the court reservation system. (Cho Decl. ¶4.) When
Defendant advised Plaintiff counsel of the issue, Plaintiff’s counsel advised
the earliest the system would let them change the date to was February 14,
2025, which they were unwilling to do so. (Cho Decl. ¶4.)  
 
At the hearing, the
parties are to advise this court whether Defendant has produced the documents
pursuant to the signed protective order. If Defendant has failed to provide the
requested documents by the hearing date, the court will grant the instant
motion. 
 
Plaintiff still seeks
sanctions in the requested amount of $2,242.50 as Defendant’s non-compliance
forced Plaintiff to file this motion, and its continued non-compliance forced Plaintiff
to file this Reply and to prepare for and appear at the hearing on December 31,
2024. The request is based on 2.7 hours drafting the motion, 0.3 reviewing the
motion, 2.5 reviewing the opposition and drafting the reply and 1 hour
attending the hearing at counsel’s hourly rate of $450. They also request the
$60 filing fee. The court finds there was needless delay on the part of
defendant, warranting sanctions of 3 hours as reasonable attorney fees for this
simple motion, plus filing fees, for a total of $1410, payable within 30 days.
