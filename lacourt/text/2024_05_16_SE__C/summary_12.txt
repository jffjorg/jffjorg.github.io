```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the judicially noticeable documents filed in conjunction with the instant Demurrer. The court finds that the doctrine of res judicata applies in this case, as the issues decided in the prior adjudication are identical with those presented in the later action. The court also finds that the doctrine of collateral estoppel applies, as the issue of possession has been adjudicated in the unlawful detainer action.

The court has overruled the demurrer to the third cause of action, as the issue of wrongful or retaliatory eviction was not actually or necessarily decided by the UD court. The court has also denied the motion to strike the third cause of action, as it is rendered moot by the court's ruling.

The court has also denied the motion to strike punitive damages, as the allegations are sufficient to warrant a claim for punitive damages at this stage in the litigation.
