 Case Number:  22NWCV00413    Hearing Date:   May 16, 2024    Dept:  C SANDOVAL v.
SANDOVAL
CASE NO.:  22NWCV00413
HEARING:  05/16/24
 
#3
 
Plaintiff MARTHA SANDOVAL’s Motion to Appoint Martha
Sandoval as Successor in Interest for Maria Sandoval is DENIED without
prejudice. 
 
Opposing Party to give notice. 
 
The parties’ requests for judicial notice are GRANTED. (Cal.
Ev. Code §452.) 
 
CCP §377.32(a)(3) requires that a person who seeks to
commence or continue an action as a decedent’s successor in interest must file
a declaration under penalty of perjury stating that there is “[n]o
proceeding…now pending in California for administration of the decedent’s
estate.” (Id.) 
 
The Affidavit of Martha Sandoval, filed on March 11, 2024,
states that there is “[n]o proceeding… now pending in California for
administration of decedent’s estate.” (Sandoval Decl., ¶3.) 
 
However, in Opposition, Defendant GLORIA SANDOVAL argues
that the Motion must be denied because there is a probate action currently
pending in the State of California involving the administration of the
Decedent’s estate. Defendant’s RJN, Ex. 1 evidences that a Petition for Letters
of Administration with Authorization to Administer Under the Independent
Administration of Estate Act, with Limited Authority was filed by Gloria
Sandoval on March 27, 2024. (Case No. 24STCPB03436). 
 
This issue is properly determined by the Probate Court.  Indeed, there is an Appointment Hearing
scheduled for July 26, 2024 in Probate Dept. 4 at 9:30 a.m. in Case No.
24STPB03436. 
 
The Court notes that, to date, no Notice of Related Case has
been filed.
