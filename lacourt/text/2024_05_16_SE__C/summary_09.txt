And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's second cause of action for elder abuse is overruled. The court has also denied the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages and attorney's fees. The plaintiff's allegations that the defendant failed to properly care for the plaintiff's husband, who developed stage III sacral decubitus ulcer wound while in the defendant's care, are sufficient to state a cause of action for elder abuse. The court has accepted the plaintiff's allegations as true and has not made any factual determinations in response to the defendant's demurrer. The court has also denied the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages and attorney's fees, as the plaintiff has adequately alleged that the defendant engaged in malicious and/or despicable conduct.
