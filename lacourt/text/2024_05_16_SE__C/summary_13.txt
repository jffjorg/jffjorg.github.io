The judge grants the plaintiff's unopposed application for a writ of possession against the defendant, Henry R. Mencias, Jr. The writ is granted because the plaintiff has shown probable cause that the property is located at the described location. The plaintiff is required to post an undertaking in the amount of $47,500.00 within 10 days of the court's issuance of this order. The defendant is required to post an undertaking in the amount of $21,041.54. The plaintiff's claim is probably valid, and the defendant's interest in the property is based on the market value of the property less liens and encumbrances.
