Plaintiff
ALLY BANK, a Corporation’s unopposed application for writ of possession as to Defendant
HENRY R. MENCIAS, JR. is GRANTED.  
 
Moving
Party to give Notice. 
 
Plaintiff
ALLY BANK, a Corporation (“Plaintiff”) applies for a writ of possession against
Defendant HENRY R. MENCIAS, JR. (“Defendant”)  pursuant to CCP §512.020.  
 
Notice
 
Prior
to the hearing, the defendant shall be served with all of the following: (a) a
copy of the summons and complaint; (b) A Notice of Application and Hearing; and
(c) a copy of the application and any affidavit in support thereof.  (CCP §512.030.)  
 
The
proof of service filed on February 5, 2024 shows that Defendant was served with
all necessary documents. 
 
Merits
 
Upon
the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, the plaintiff may apply
for a writ of possession.  (CCP §512.010(a).)  The application shall include all of the
following: 
 
1.   
A
showing of the basis of the plaintiff’s claim and that the plaintiff is
entitled to possession of the property claimed. If the basis of the plaintiff’s
claim is a written instrument, a copy of the instrument shall be attached. 
2.   
A
showing that the property is wrongfully detained and of the manner in which
defendant came into possession. 
3.   
A
particular description of the property and a statement of its value.
4.   
The
property’s location based on plaintiff’s knowledge, information and belief; and

5.   
A
statement that the property has not been seized by statute or execution against
it. 
 
The
writ will be issued if the plaintiff’s claim is probably valid.  (CCP §512.040(b).)  A writ to take possession of property at a
private location requires the plaintiff to show probable cause that the
property is located there.  (CCP §512.060(b).)
 
The
Contract at issue concerning the sale of a 2016 Peterbilt 389 motor vehicle was
assigned to Plaintiff. (Singleton Decl., ¶5.) “Said Contract is in default…. As
of November 29, 2023, there is due, owing, and unpaid to Plaintiff on account
of the Contract the sum of $26,458.46….” (Id. ¶6.) 
 
The
property has not been seized pursuant to an execution or attachment. 
 
Based
on the evidence presented. It is relatively undisputed that Plaintiff’s claim
is valid. 
 
Undertaking:  A bond must be posted as part of the
undertaking unless the court finds that the defendant has no interest in the
property.  (CCP 515.010(b).)  The undertaking must be in an amount equal to
twice the value of the defendant's interest in the property (market value less
all liens, etc.).  (CCP 515.010.)  Defendant’s interest is based on the market
value of the property less (1) any amount due and owing on any conditional
sales contract or security agreement, (2) all liens and encumbrances on the
property, and (3) any other factors to determine the defendant’s interest in
the property.  (CCP 515.010(a).)
 
The
balance owed ($26,458.46) is less than the value of the Property (as valuated
by Plaintiff to be between $47,500.00 and $64,025.00). Plaintiff is required to
post an undertaking in the amount of $47,500.00 within 10 days after the
Court’s issuance of this Order. 
 
The undertaking required by
Defendant for redelivery or to stay delivery is $21,041.54,. (CCP §515.020.)
