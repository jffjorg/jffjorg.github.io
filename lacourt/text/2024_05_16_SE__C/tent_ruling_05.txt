Moving Party to give Notice. 
 
This motor vehicle action was filed by Plaintiff RAUL
HEREDIA (“Plaintiff”) against Defendants ACCESS SERVICES; CALIFORNIA TRANSIT,
INC; LOS ANGELES COUNTY; MYNOR RUBEN HERNANDEZ; and MELISSA ELAINE DOOLITTE
(collectively “Defendants”) on October 27, 2022. Plaintiff alleges that “[o]n
or about December 15, 2021, PLAINTIFF, a legally blind and disabled person,
contacted Defendant ACCESS SERVICES… for transportation services.” (Complaint
¶1.) “At or around 2:00PM, Plaintiff was seated in the rear of the vehicle…. The
SUBJECT VAN was driving at a speed greater than reasonable having due regard
for the traffic, in a manner that endangered the safety of PLAINTIFF… and was
forced to rapidly decelerate ahead of the SUBJECT HONDA.” (Id. ¶5.) “DEFENDANT
DOOLITTLE was driving at an unsafe and excessive speed for traffic conditions,
when she failed to observe the SUBJECT VAN that was rapidly decelerating ahead
of her. As a result, DEFENDANT DOOLITTLE did not stop the SUBJECT HONDA in time
and collided with the SUBJECT VAN (‘SUBJECT INCIDENT’).” (Id. ¶7.) 
 
Plaintiff’s Complaint asserts the following causes of
action: 
 
(1) Negligence;

(2) Negligence
Per Se; and 
(3) Negligent
Entrustment
 
Defendants ACCESS SERVICES; CALIFORNIA TRANSIT, INC.; and
MYNOR RUBEN HERNANDEZ (collectively “Defendants”) move to compel Plaintiff’s
further responses to Form Interrogatories (set one) and Special Interrogatories
(set one). 
 
Plaintiff’s Omnibus Opposition to both Motions was supposed
to be filed and served by no later than May 3, 2024. (CCP §1005(b).) However,
without leave of Court, the Omnibus Opposition was untimely filed on May 9,
2024. In the interests of judicial efficiency, the Court exercises its
discretion and considers the arguments raised in the untimely Opposition— that
Plaintiff’s objections are valid; that Plaintiff provided complete and
straightforward responses; and that the Motions should be denied due to Defendant’s
failure to adequately meet and confer before the Motions were filed. 
 
To ensure that Defendants/Moving Parties are not prejudiced
by the Court’s consideration of Plaintiff’s untimely Opposition, the Court will
hear Defendants’ oral arguments in Reply at the hearing. If necessary, the
Court will continue the Motions. 
 
Meet and Confer 
 
Defendants’ counsel sent a meet and confer letter regarding
Plaintiff’s initial responses on November 29, 2023, demanding supplemental
responses by no later than December 28, 2023. Plaintiff did not provide
supplemental responses by December 28, 2023. These Motions were filed on January
5, 2024, after Defendants received no supplemental responses to the November
29, 2023 correspondence because the 45-day deadline was approaching. 
 
The Court finds that the meet and confer that took place in
this matter, sufficiently complies with CCP §2016.040.
 
Merits
 
“If the propounding party, on receipt of a
response to interrogatories, deems that (1) an answer to a particular
interrogatory is…incomplete…or (3) an objection to an interrogatory is without
merit or too general, that party may move for an order compelling further
response.” (CCP §2030.300(a).)
 
The Motions are GRANTED in their entirety. The Court has reviewed Plaintiff’s initial
responses to the discovery at issue and finds that they are incomplete and
non-responsive. The Court notes that Plaintiff has failed to file or lodge a
Separate Statement in Opposition to the Moving Party’s Separate Statement in
support of the instant Motion. Where no Separate Statement in Opposition has
been filed, Plaintiff fails to substantiate his boilerplate objections. Plaintiff’s
unsubstantiated objections are overruled. Plaintiff
is obligated to provide full and responsive responses to the discovery at
issue. 
 
The Motions are
GRANTED. Plaintiff is ORDERED to provide further responses to Defendants Form
Interrogatories (set one) and Special Interrogatories (set one), without
objections, by no later than 30 days from the date of the Court’s issuance of
this Order. This date may be extended by agreement of the parties. 
 
Sanctions 
 
Reasonable sanctions in favor of Defendants are warranted.
Plaintiff and their counsel are jointly and severally ORDERED to pay reasonable
sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,050.00 ($350/hr. x 3 hrs.), payable
within 30 days of the Court’s issuance of this Order. This date may be extended
by agreement of the parties.
