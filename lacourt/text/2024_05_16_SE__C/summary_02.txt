And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge denies the motion for determination of good faith settlement between the Plaintiff, THE WINDMILL CO., INC., and the Defendant, ACE ESCROW, INC. The Judge finds that the settlement agreement between the parties fails to meet the standards of a good faith settlement. The settlement agreement provides for the release of $30,000.00 to the Plaintiff, which the Judge finds is disproportionate to Ace's purported liability as alleged by the O&C Defendants in the Orange County action. The Judge also finds that there is insufficient evidence provided of the rough approximation of Windmill's total recovery and Ace's proportional liability, as opposed to the O&C Defendants' proportional liability.
