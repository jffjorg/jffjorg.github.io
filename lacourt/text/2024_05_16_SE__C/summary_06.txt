```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court rules that the Plaintiff's Ex Parte Application to Set Aside Arbitration Order is off-calendar. The Court finds that it lacks jurisdiction to rule on the Application based on the September 12, 2023 Order staying the matter pending arbitration. The Court notes that neither party has moved to lift the arbitration stay, and therefore, the Court cannot reconsider the arbitration order. Additionally, the Court finds that the Plaintiff's Application is procedurally defective as it was filed late and does not meet the statutory requirements for a motion for reconsideration. The Court denies the Plaintiff's Application and notes that the Defendant's CCP §128.7 Request for Sanctions may be raised by a separately noticed motion pending conclusion of arbitration.
