  Case Number:  BC712959    Hearing Date:   February 6, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiffs Stephen McFadyen, Seth
Blackham, and Monica Garcia’s Motion to Amend Order Granting Final Settlement Approval
Plaintiffs Stephen McFadyen, Seth Blackham, and
Monica Garcia move to amend the court’s order granting final approval of class
action settlement.  They move to increase
the allocation of expenses to settlement administrator Epiq from $300,000 to $442,062.41.  
Plaintiffs present insufficient evidence to warrant
increasing the settlement allocation to Epiq by $142,062.41.  Plaintiffs’ only evidence is the declaration
of attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan.  She
states Epiq incurred additional expenses doing a second distribution of
payments to 7,181 class members in 2023. 
(Liss-Riordan Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.)  She
testifies, “As a result of the work associated with extending the claims period
and administering a second distribution, Epiq has incurred $142,062.41 in
administration costs that it did not anticipate and account for in its initial
estimate of the cost of administering this settlement.”  (Id., ¶ 7.)  Plaintiffs, however, submit no evidence by a
representative of Epiq with personal knowledge of its expenses.  Nor do they submit an invoice or other documentary
evidence of Epiq’s expenses.  
Plaintiffs’ motion to amend order granting final
settlement approval is denied
without prejudice.
