And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to amend the order granting final approval of a class action settlement. The plaintiffs, Stephen McFadyen, Seth Blackham, and Monica Garcia, are seeking to increase the allocation of expenses to the settlement administrator, Epiq, from $300,000 to $442,062.41. However, the judge finds that the plaintiffs have presented insufficient evidence to support this request. The only evidence presented is a declaration from attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan, who states that Epiq incurred additional expenses due to a second distribution of payments to class members. However, the judge notes that the declaration lacks personal knowledge of Epiq's expenses and does not include an invoice or other documentary evidence. As a result, the judge denies the motion to amend the order without prejudice.
