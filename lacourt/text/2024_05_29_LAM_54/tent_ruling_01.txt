Hearing Date: May 29, 2024
Department 54, Judge Maurice Leiter
Motion to Set Aside Dismissal
Moving Party: Plaintiff Dr. Emil Kohan
Responding Party: None
 
T/R:      PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO SET ASIDE
DISMISSAL IS GRANTED.
 
PLAINTIFF TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
 
The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received.
 
CCP § 473(b) provides, in pertinent part,
“[t]he court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her
legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding
taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.”
 
Plaintiff moves to set aside the
dismissal entered by the Court on April 15, 2024. Plaintiff’s counsel
represents the Court mistakenly believed that all parties had settled and
ordered the action dismissed. Counsel states that due to technical
difficulties, counsel was unable to appear at the April 15, 2024 hearing to
clarify that only some parties had settled. This is good cause to vacate the
dismissal.
 
Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED.
