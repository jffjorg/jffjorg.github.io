Tentative Ruling:

The Court has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The plaintiff, Dr. Emil Kohan, filed the motion to set aside the dismissal entered by the Court on April 15, 2024. The Court mistakenly believed that all parties had settled and ordered the action dismissed. However, due to technical difficulties, the plaintiff's counsel was unable to appear at the April 15, 2024 hearing to clarify that only some parties had settled. The Court finds that this is good cause to vacate the dismissal. The plaintiff's motion is granted.
