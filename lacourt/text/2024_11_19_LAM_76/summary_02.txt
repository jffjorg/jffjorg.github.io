And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Lyft, Inc. and an unnamed plaintiff. The judge has granted Attorney Daniel E. Jones' motion to appear as counsel for Lyft, Inc. pro hac vice. Lyft, Inc. has also moved to compel arbitration and stay proceedings, and the judge has granted this motion as well.

The judge found that Lyft, Inc. presented sufficient evidence to establish the existence of a valid arbitration agreement, which was electronically signed by the plaintiff when they agreed to the terms of service agreement. The arbitration agreement requires that disputes be resolved through individual arbitration, rather than through a jury trial.

The judge noted that California favors arbitration and that arbitration agreements are valid, irrevocable, and enforceable. The judge also stated that the party petitioning to compel arbitration has the burden of establishing the existence of a valid agreement to arbitrate.

The judge ordered the action to be stayed pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) ยง 1281.4, pending the outcome of the arbitration.
