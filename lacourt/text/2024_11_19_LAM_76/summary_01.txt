And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel the defendant's attendance at a deposition. The plaintiff served the deposition notice on September 30, 2024, but the defendant did not appear at the scheduled deposition on October 14, 2024. The plaintiff argues that the defendant's failure to appear warrants the court's intervention, but the judge finds that the plaintiff did not make a sufficient showing of why the discovery motion could not have been filed before the discovery cutoff. The judge notes that once the discovery cutoff has passed, a party has no right to have discovery motions heard, but the court retains discretion to hear late-filed motions. However, the court must first determine that discovery should be reopened based on the section 2024.050(b) factors. In this case, the court has continued the trial date but did not order the reopening of discovery, so the motion to compel is denied without prejudice. The judge recommends that the parties meet and confer to resolve any outstanding discovery issues without the need for further motion practice.
