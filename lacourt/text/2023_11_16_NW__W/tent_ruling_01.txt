discussion
 
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Noel Lustig,
M.D. dba Psychiatric Medical Group move this court for an order compelling
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Marc L. Nehorayan, M.D., A Professional Corporation
to provide verified further responses, without objections, to Special
Interrogatories, Set Four Nos. 121 through 125, 140, and 141 and Demands for
Inspection Nos. 176, 179, and 180. 
 
Interrogatories
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section
2030.300, a court may order a party to serve a further response to
interrogatories when the court finds that any of the following apply: (1) An
answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete.  (2) An exercise of the option to produce
documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification
of those documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to an interrogatory is
without merit or too general.  
 
Plaintiff argues Special
Interrogatories Nos. 121 through 125 seek to have Defendant identify the checks
payable to PMG and/or Dr. Lustig, which Defendant deposited into its and/or Dr.
Nehorayan's bank accounts from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2014. Plaintiff
contends Defendant's counsel has admitted to having stacks of these checks yet Defendant's
initial responses to these interrogatories simply consisted of a myriad of
boilerplate objections and the supplemental responses simply refer to a mass of
documents produced by a third party. Moreover, Special Interrogatories Nos. 140
and 141 seek to have Defendant list the Initial Evaluation Reports and Bills
and Requests for Authorization of Psychology Services issued by Dr. Nehorayan
through PMG for services he rendered up through March 31, 2015, for which
Defendants claim PMG received the payment and for which PMG had no interest.
Accordingly, the information sought is directly relevant to the claims asserted
by Plaintiff and Defendant’s objections are without merit and their responses
are evasive. 
 
In opposition, Defendant argues these
“make work” interrogatories would require that Defendant compile information
that is equally available to Propounding party (the checks at issue) and then
type descriptions of each check into a special interrogatory response.
Moreover, PMG’s overbroad demand for “Initial Evaluation Reports and Bills” has
nothing whatsoever to do with Nehorayan Corp.’s claims and defenses in this
case and everything to do with whatever case they are attempting to cobble
together. Defendant also contends the only way to determine which “Initial
Evaluation Reports and Bills” correspond to payments made on patient files
where Nehorayan Corp. was either the sole unpaid biller on the file or where
the amount owed to it at that time exceeded a settlement payment is to
re-review each and every one of the thousands upon thousands of payments made
during the four year period requested.
 
The court finds Defendant’s objections
without merit and evasive. As noted by Plaintiff, these interrogatories seek to
confirm the dates and amounts of such checks during that time period. Moreover,
Defendant’s responses do not meet the requirements for invoking Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.230. Specifically, they do not in “sufficient detail []
permit the propounding party to locate and to identify, as readily as the
responding party can, the documents from which the answer may be ascertained.”
(CCP §2030.230.) 
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s request compelling further responses to special interrogatories,
nos. 121-125, 140-141. 
 
Plaintiff also requests monetary
sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $4,710.00 against Defendant
Nehorayan Corporation and its counsel, David Mayes and Gabriel Law Group, PC,
for reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in bringing this instant
motion. Defendant asks for their own sanctions in the sum of $4,037.50 against PMG
and their attorney of record, Alan Goldberg. However, the court denies both
requests with there being substantial justification on both sides. (See CCP
§2030.300(d).)
 
Demand for Production
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.310, the Court may order a responding to serve a further response to a
request for production when the Court finds that any of the following apply: (1)
A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete; (2) A representation
of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. (3) An objection
in the response is without merit or too general.
 
Plaintiff argues Demand No. 176 seeks
all reconciliations performed on the PMG checks (which were payable to PMG
and/or Dr. Lustig as sole or co-payees) that Defendant deposited into its bank
account during the period of January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2014.
Moreover, Demands Nos. 179 and 180 seeks liens that Defendants placed on
patients treated 12 by Dr. Lustig and/or PMG on or before March 31, 2015. As a
result, all of these demands are directly relevant to the claims in this action
as set forth in the Operative Third Amended Complaint.
 
In opposition, Defendant argues they
have produced code compliant responses and the reports sought are easily and
equally available to PMG. First, the court finds response to No. 176 code
compliant. Defendant states “After a diligent search and reasonable inquiry Responding
Party responds that it has no documents in its possession, custody or control responsive
to this demand.” Although Special Interrogatory No. 131 refers to six payments,
Defendant has also provided it does not have them in their possession. This is
sufficient. 
 
Next, the court finds RPD No. 179 and
180 are not code compliant. As noted by Plaintiff, if Defendant’s contention is
that the request misstates Defendant’s position, Defendant must provide it
cannot comply with the Demand because no such documents exist. (CCP §2031.230.)
Moreover, if Defendant refers to documents elsewhere, Defendant’s response must
specifically identify any documents responsive to this demand. Lastly,
Defendant’s objection that the documents sought are equally available to
Plaintiff is not proper. If responding party lacks personal knowledge,
the respondent “shall so state, but shall make a reasonable and good faith
effort to obtain the information by inquiry to other natural persons or
organizations, except where the information is equally available to the
propounding party.”  (CCP § 2030.220(c); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390,
406.)  A propounding party cannot force the responding party to compile
information available in the public record.  (Bunnell v. Superior Court
(1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 720, 723; Alpine Mutual Water Company v. Superior
Court (1968) 259 Cal.App.2d 45, 54.) 
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s request compelling further responses to request for production of
documents, nos. 179-180. 
 
Plaintiff again requests monetary
sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $2,910.00 against Defendant
Nehorayan Corporation and its counsel, David Mayes and Gabriel Law Group, PC,
for having to bring the second motion. Defendant also again asks for their own
sanctions in the sum of $2,612.50 against PMG and their attorney of record,
Alan Goldberg. However, the court denies both requests with there being
substantial justification on both sides. (See CCP §2031.310(h).)
