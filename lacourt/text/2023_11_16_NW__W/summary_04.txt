And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for a discovery protective order and monetary sanctions in the amount of $750. The defendants, Masis Khachadourian and Forgiato, Inc., had sought to limit the plaintiff's discovery requests, which they claimed were unduly burdensome and harassing. The plaintiff, Tracey Peterson, argued that the defendants had not shown good cause for limiting the discovery requests and that the requests were specific and tailored to address the elements of liability. The judge found that the defendants had not presented good cause for limiting the discovery requests and that the requests were not overly burdensome. As a result, the judge denied the defendants' motion for a protective order and monetary sanctions.
