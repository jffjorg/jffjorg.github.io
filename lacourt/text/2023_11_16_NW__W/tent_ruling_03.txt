BACKGROUND
 
Hunt Properties, Inc. is the owner of
the commercial real property located at approximately 7108 De Soto Avenue in
Canoga Park, California (“Subject Property”). Henry Becker (“Defendant Becker”)
is a manager and/or employee of Defendant Hunt. 
Since about 2015, Raul Aguila (“Plaintiff Aguila”) was a tenant of the
Subject Property.  Orley Onofre
(“Plaintiff Onofre”) is an employee of Plaintiff Aguila.  Plaintiffs Aguila and Onofre (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”), allege, beginning in January of 2022, Defendant Becker has
engaged in pattern of racist and harassing behavior in an effort to drive-out
Plaintiffs from the Subject Premises, and force Plaintiffs to terminate the
governing lease agreement. Defendant Becker’s harassment included physical
harassment, and verbal harassment. 
Plaintiffs allege, when Plaintiffs made clear they refused to vacate the
Subject Property despite Defendant Becker’s harassing behavior, Defendant
Becker then served Plaintiffs with a 30-day Notice to Quit, notifying
Plaintiffs the tenancy had ended and Plaintiffs would be required to vacate the
Subject Property within thirty days. Plaintiffs allege Defendant Hunt’s
employment and failure to properly train Defendant Becker constitutes
negligence.  Plaintiffs further allege
Defendant Becker’s conduct caused Plaintiffs’ emotional distress.
 
On July 5, 2022, Plaintiffs initiated
the present action by filing a Complaint against Defendant Hunt and Defendant
Becker (collectively, “Defendants”). Plaintiff’s Complaint alleges the
following causes of action: (1) Negligence; (2) Negligent Retention and
Supervision; (3) Threats of Violence in Violation of Cal. Civ. Code §§ 51.7(B);
and (4) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.
 
Defendant Becker filed a third amended cross-complaint
against Plaintiffs on July 17, 2023 asserting causes of action for (1) Nuisance
and (2) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress. 
 
Request for entry of default was
entered September 13, 2022. Plaintiff filed an amendment to complaint correct
Defendant Hunt’s name to H.U.N.T. Properties, Inc. 
 
The court set aside the request for
entry of default on February 28, 2023. 
 
On October 25, 2023, Plaintiffs
dismissed their action against Defendants. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Defendant H.U.N.T. Properties, Inc. Motion to Compel Plaintiff Raul
Aguila to Respond to Form Interrogatories is GRANTED. 
 
Defendant H.U.N.T. Properties, Inc. Motion to Compel Plaintiff Orley
Onofre to Respond to Form Interrogatories is GRANTED. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant H.U.N.T. Properties, Inc. move this court for an order
compelling Plaintiffs Raul Aguila and Orley Onofre to respond to Defendant’s
first set of form interrogatories served on May 22, 2023. Defendant also seeks
monetary sanctions Plaintiffs in the amount of $2,760 against Plaintiff Aguila
and $1,410 against Plaintiff Onofre. 
 
Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests,
the court may make an order compelling responses. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300,
2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to
serve a timely response to the discovery request waives any objection to the
request, including one based on privilege or the protection of attorney work
product. (CCP §§2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a); Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.)
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may
also move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of
any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction. (CCP § 2033.280(b).)
 
On May 22, 2023, Defendant propounded Defendant’s first set of form
interrogatories on Plaintiffs Aguila and Onofre. (Hamilton Decl. ¶2, Exh. 1.) Plaintiffs’
responses were due by June 22, 2023. (Hamilton Decl. ¶3.) Plaintiffs requested
an extension, which Defendant granted; however, Defendant did not receive the
responses by the extended deadline. (Hamilton Decl. ¶¶3-4, Exh. 2.) Defendant
followed up with Plaintiff’s counsel and Plaintiff requested another extension.
(Hamilton Decl. ¶¶4-5, Exh. 3.) At the time of the filing of this motion,
Defendant has not received any response. (Hamilton Decl. ¶6.) 
 
As such, Defendant’s unopposed
motion to compel Plaintiffs’ discovery responses to Defendant’s Form
Interrogatories, Set One is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to produce verified
discovery responses without objection in ten days.
 
Sanctions
 
Defendant requests monetary sanctions against Plaintiffs in the amount of $2,760 against Plaintiff Aguila
and $1,410 against Plaintiff Onofre. 
 
If a propounding party moves for and
obtains a court order compelling a response, the court shall impose monetary
sanctions against the party failing to timely respond to interrogatories and
demands for inspection unless that party acted with substantial justification
or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (CCP §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c),
2033.280(c); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148
Cal.App.4th at 404.) 
 
Defense counsel contends they spent two
hours preparing Aguila’s motion, anticipate spending 1 hour reviewing the
opposition and reply, and anticipate an additional three hours attending the
hearing. (Hamilton Decl. ¶7.) Counsel also incurred the $60 filing fee.
(Hamilton Decl. ¶7.) Defense counsel also requests two hours for preparing Onofry’s
motion, 1 hour in anticipation for reviewing the opposition and reply, and the
$60 filing fee. (Hamilton Decl. ¶7.) Counsel’s hourly rate is $450. 
 
Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED, in the reduced
amount of $1,410 for the first motion and $960 for the second motion. The court
finds only one hour necessary for attending the hearing on the two motions.
