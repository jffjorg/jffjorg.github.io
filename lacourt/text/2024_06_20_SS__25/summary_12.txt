Here is the summary in English text:

This Tentative Ruling is regarding a lawsuit filed by Lorie Jones against Matthias Hong alleging breach of contract and common counts. The lawsuit arose from an alleged breach of a lease agreement. Defendant Hong filed an unopposed demurrer and motion to strike, arguing that the first and second causes of action fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The Court notes that there is no proof of service pertaining to the motion to strike, and therefore assumes that Plaintiff did not receive notice of the motion to strike.

The Court finds that the meet and confer requirement has been met. The Court also finds that the Complaint states sufficient facts for a cause of action for breach of contract, and therefore overrules the demurrer to the first cause of action. However, the Court sustains the demurrer to the second cause of action for common counts, as Plaintiff has failed to allege the sum of money that was had and received.

The motion to strike is denied as moot, as the demurrer to the Complaint has been sustained in its entirety. The Moving Party is ordered to give notice and to attach a copy of the Court's Tentative Ruling as an exhibit to the notice.
