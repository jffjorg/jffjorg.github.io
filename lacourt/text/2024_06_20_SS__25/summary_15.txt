And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge issued a Tentative Ruling in the case of Diya Finance, LLC (Petitioner) vs. Malbros Ready Mix Concrete, LLC (Respondent). The Petitioner filed a Verified Petition for Release of Property from Lien on February 14, 2024, seeking to release a property located at 832 South Saint Andrews Place, Los Angeles, CA 90005 from a claim of mechanics lien recorded by Respondent on January 11, 2023. The lien was for $1,075.00 for delivery and sale of concrete to the location. The Petitioner alleges that Respondent failed to bring an action to enforce the lien within 90 days and has not filed to foreclose the lien.

The Judge found that Respondent was not afforded the statutorily required 16 court days’ notice under CCP § 1005(b) and therefore continues the hearing on the Petition to July 23, 2024, to afford Respondent the required notice. The Judge also orders the Moving Party to give notice and attach a copy of the Court’s Tentative Ruling as an exhibit to the notice.
