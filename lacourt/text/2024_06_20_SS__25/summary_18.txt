And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to quash the summons and complaint or, alternatively, motion to dismiss the entire action for lack of and defective service of process. The defendant argued that the service was improper and invalid, but the judge found that the plaintiff had shown reasonable diligence in attempting to serve the defendant and that the service was proper. The judge also noted that the defendant had not provided any evidence to contradict the proof of service and that the court is not required to accept the defendant's self-serving declaration. As a result, the judge has denied the motion and ordered the defendant to file her answer or responsive pleading to the plaintiff's complaint within 30 days.
