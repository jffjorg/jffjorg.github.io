 
BACKGROUND
 
On February
14, 2024, Petitioner Diya Finance, LLC (“Petitioner”) filed a Verified Petition
for Release of Property from Lien (the “Petition”) against Respondent Malbros
Ready Mix Concrete, LLC (“Respondent”). 
 
According to the Petition, Petitioner is the beneficial
owner of the real property located at 832 South Saint Andrews Place, Los
Angeles, CA 90005 (the “Property”). (Petition, ¶ 1.) On January 11, 2023, in
the Official Records of Los Angeles County, California, Respondent recorded a
claim of mechanics lien against the Property. (Petition, ¶ 3; Exh. A.) The lien
was recorded in the official records of the County Recorder as Instrument No.:
20230021610. (Petition, ¶ 3; Exh. A.) The claim of the lien was in the amount
of $1,075.00 for delivery and sale of concrete to location. (Petition, ¶ 3;
Exh. A.) 
 
The Petition further alleges that Respondent failed to
bring an action to enforce the lien within 90 days after the recordation of the
claim of lien as required by Civ. Code § 8460. (Petition, ¶ 4.) No action has
been filed to foreclose the lien, no extension of credit has been recorded, and
the time period during which suit can be brought to foreclose the lien has
expired. (Petition, ¶ 4.) Respondent is unwilling to execute a release of the
lien. (Petition, ¶ 5.) On January 29, 2024, Petitioner sent Respondent a
written demand letter to remove the lien by certified mail; however, Respondent
did not respond to the written demand letter. (Petition, ¶¶ 6-7; Exh. A.)
Petitioner has not filed for relief under any law governing bankruptcy, and
there exists no other restraint to prevent Respondent from filing to foreclose
the lien. (Petition, ¶ 8.) 
 
Concerning relief, Petitioner prays for the Property to be
released from Respondent’s claim of lien, costs, and attorneys’ fees. (Petition
at p. 2:27-3:3.)  
 
On February 14, 2024, the Court issued a Notice of Hearing
on Petition, which set the hearing on the Petition for June 20, 2024.
Petitioner was ordered to serve a copy of the Notice of Hearing on all parties
in this action and to file a proof of service thereof. 
 
Petitioner filed a proof of service showing that the
Petition, Notice of Hearing on Petition, and associated case documents were
served on Respondent on June 4, 2024 via United States mail. (See 06/04/24
Proof of Service.)

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Petition
for Release of Property from Lien 
A.               
Legal Standard 
A court
order dismissing a cause of action to enforce a lien or releasing property from
a claim of lien, or a judgment that no lien exists, shall include all of the
following information:
(1) The date
of recordation of the claim of lien.
(2) The
county in which the claim of lien is recorded.
(3) The book and page or series number of the place in the official
records where the claim of lien is recorded.
(4) The
legal description of the property.  
(Civ. Code,
§ 8490, subd. (a)(1)-(4).) 
 
B.        Discussion
            “Unless
otherwise ordered or specifically provided by law, all moving and supporting
papers shall be served and filed at least 16 court days before the hearing.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 
            Here,
the Petition and Notice of Hearing were served on Respondent on June 4, 2024,
which is less than 16 court days before the June 20, 2024 hearing date. Thus,
Respondent was not afforded the statutorily required 16 court days’ notice
under CCP § 1005(b). 
            As
such, the Court CONTINUES the hearing on the Petition to
afford Respondent the required 16 court days’ notice pursuant to CCP § 1005(b).
 

II.        Conclusion 
 
            The Court CONTINUES the hearing on the Petition to Tuesday,
July 23, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in this department, to afford the Respondent the required
16 court days’ notice pursuant to CCP § 1005(b).  
 
            The Moving Party is
ordered to give notice and to attach a copy of the Court’s Tentative Ruling, as
an exhibit “A” to said notice, as the final order of the Court.
