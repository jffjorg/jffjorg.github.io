And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion by the City of Pasadena to set aside and vacate the entry of default against itself and the Pasadena Police Department. The City argues that the defaults were improperly entered because the time for it to file a responsive pleading had not yet expired due to an automatic 30-day extension provided by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41(a)(2). The City also seeks relief under section 473(b) due to its counsel's mistaken belief that the extension applied. The Court agrees that there was no automatic extension in effect because there were no timely attempts to meet and confer in good faith. The Court vacates the entry of default based on section 473(b). The City's motion is granted, and the defaults are vacated. Both parties' requests for sanctions are denied.
