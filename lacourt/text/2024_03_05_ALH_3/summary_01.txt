**Key Evidence**

* Declaration of Sean Lee
* Declaration of John Woods
* Invoice for labor and materials
* Exhibits attached to the declarations

**Legal Standards**

* Summary judgment is granted if the moving party shows that there are no triable issues of material fact and the opposing party fails to show that a triable issue of material fact exists.
* A party may move for summary adjudication as to one or more causes of action within an action, one or more affirmative defenses, one or more claims for damages, or one or more issues of duty.

**Significant Statements**
