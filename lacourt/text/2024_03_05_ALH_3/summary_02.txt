Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by General Motors, LLC (Defendant) against Emilio Antonio and Zayra Santiago (Plaintiffs) in a lawsuit alleging fraud and violation of the Unfair Competition Law (UCL). The Plaintiffs claim that the Defendant made false representations about the range capability and battery safety of a 2020 Chevrolet Bolt, which they purchased. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiffs' claims lack specificity and are based on general and conclusory allegations.

The judge grants the Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to the Fourth Cause of Action for fraud, finding that the Plaintiffs failed to plead the elements of fraud with the requisite level of particularity. The judge also grants the motion with respect to the Fifth Cause of Action for violation of the UCL, finding that the Plaintiffs failed to identify any underlying statutory violation or unfair conduct.

The judge orders that the motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted in its entirety without leave to amend.
