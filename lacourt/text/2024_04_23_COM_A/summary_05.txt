English-text summary:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer by the defendant City of Carson to the first amended complaint (FAC) with leave to amend. The ruling holds that the plaintiffs have not alleged a statutory basis for liability against the City to support the first, second, and fourth causes of action. The plaintiffs' claims are based on the City's alleged negligence in failing to inspect, test, and permit the outdoor seating area fronting the IHOP restaurant. The court finds that the plaintiffs have not identified a statutory basis for liability and that the City is immune from liability for failing to enforce a law. The court also rules that the plaintiffs' claims do not arise from a dangerous condition of public property.
