Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the petition for approval of the minor's compromise, which involves a settlement agreement between the Plaintiffs (Kalli Williams, Jerall Williams, and Claimant's mother) and Defendant Wilber Troutman, M.D., on behalf of St Francis Medical Center. The settlement amount is $150,000, but after deducting Medi-Cal lien and counsel's fees and costs, the net settlement to the Claimant is $23,226.91. The court finds that the requested disbursement to counsel is not in the best interest of the Claimant, as it prioritizes counsel's interests over the Claimant's immediate and future needs. The court also questions the reasonableness of counsel's fee request of $40,018.00, which may not be reasonable under California Rules of Court 7.955. The court concludes that the petition is denied.
