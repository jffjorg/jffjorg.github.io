 Case Number:  23CMCV00046    Hearing Date:   April 23, 2024    Dept:  A 23CMCV00046 Malcolm Harper v. Maximo ChavezTuesday, April 23, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. [TENTATIVE] ORDER TAKING OFF CALENDAR DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO COMPEL PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO FORM INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE; SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE; REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET ONE; AND FOR IMPOSITION OF MONETARY SANCTIONS       The complaint alleges a claim for negligence arising from an automobile collision causing injury to Plaintiff. On February 22, 2024, the Court granted counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff who counsel attested had abandoned the case. The order became effective the same day. Plaintiff is now self-represented.      Defendant served this motion on Plaintiff by electronic mail but failed to include Plaintiff’s email address. Regardless, electronic service on an unrepresented party is permitted if that party consents. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6). There is no evidence of Plaintiff’s consent to electronic service.      Accordingly, the motion is TAKEN OFF CALENDAR for defective service.
