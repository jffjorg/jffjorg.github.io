And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the petition filed by Jovan Kiro Roaches-Lambey, through Keonee Young, to change his name to Jovan Kiro Young-Lambey. Since only one parent has consented to the name change, the petitioner must serve the other parent with an order to show cause at least 30 days before the hearing. The petitioner must also make diligent efforts to locate the other parent and file proof of service with the court prior to the hearing. If the other parent cannot be located, the petitioner must file a supplemental declaration explaining the attempts made to locate the other parent. The hearing has been continued to June 11, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton Courthouse.
