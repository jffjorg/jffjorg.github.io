And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies a petition filed by Heather Nicole Mulkey to change her name, without prejudice. The court was unable to consider the petition because it was not scanned into court records. The court reviewed a criminal history assessment and found substantial reasons to deny the petition, citing a California court decision. The court also found that the requirements for publishing an order to show cause were not met. The petition is denied, but the petitioner may file an amended petition without incurring further filing fees, and is ordered to comply with the requirements for publication.
