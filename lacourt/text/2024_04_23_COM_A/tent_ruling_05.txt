Dine Brands Global, Inc., et al.Tuesday, April 23,  2024, at 8:30 a.m. [TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING DEMURRER BY DEFENDANT, CITY OF CARSON, TO PLAINTIFFS’ FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT WITH LEAVE TO AMEND I.        BACKGROUND           The first amended complaint (“FAC") alleges that Plaintiffs’ decedent was killed inside a restaurant’s patio area after a car, driven by Defendant, Timothy William Siaki, crashed through the restaurant while being pursued by the Sheriff’s Department. Plaintiffs allege that Defendant, International House of Pancakes (“IHOP”), was negligent in failing to install barriers for the outdoor seating area, which was improperly inspected and permitted by the City of Carson (“City”). Plaintiffs allege claims for negligence and wrongful death. II.      ARGUMENTS      Defendant City demurs to the entire complaint for uncertainty and for failure to allege a statutory basis for the claims. The City specifically demurs to the first cause of action for wrongful death, the second cause of action which asserts a survivor claim on behalf of the decedent’s estate, and the fourth cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress. The City contends it is immune from liability for failing to inspect private property, from failing to adopt an enactment, or failing to enforce any law.      In opposition, Plaintiffs argue that the claim for dangerous condition of public property is well stated. The claims are not uncertain. Defendant owes a mandatory duty to remedy a dangerous condition on its property. The City is not immune from dangerous conditions it creates.      In reply, the City argues that Plaintiffs misunderstand the demurrer and fail to address the defects raised. Plaintiffs fail to identify any statute on which liability is based. The City is not responsible for inspecting, permitting, or enforcing code enforcement standards related to outdoor dining.III.    LEGAL STANDARDS      A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v. Foundation Health (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.) In testing the complaint’s sufficiency, the court must assume the truth of the properly pleaded factual allegations as well as facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly pleaded facts. The court may also consider matters properly subject to judicial notice. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)      The court may not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. (Moore v. Conliffe (1994) 7 Cal.4th 634, 638.) Plaintiff is required to allege facts sufficient to establish every element of each cause of action. (Rakestraw v. California Physicians Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) Where the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer. Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(e); (Zelig v. County of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.4th 1112, 1126.)      Sufficient facts are the essential facts of the case "with reasonable precision and with particularity that is sufficiently specific to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his cause of action.” (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.)  Whether the Plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant. (Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.)      A demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is “uncertain.” Uncertainty exists where a complaint’s factual allegations are so confusing, they do not sufficiently apprise a defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet. (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2; Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(f).)IV.    DISCUSSION      The basis for liability against the City is their alleged negligence in failing to properly inspect, test, and permit the outdoor seating area fronting the IHOP restaurant. (FAC, ¶ ¶ 52.) A public entity is not liable for an injury except as provided by statute. (Gov. Code § 815.) Plaintiffs must allege sufficiently detailed facts to support an inference that each of the statutory elements of liability is satisfied. General allegations are regarded as inadequate. (Mittenhuber v. City of Redondo Beach (1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 1, 5.) Moreover, “[s]ince the duty of a governmental agency can only be created by statute or ‘enactment,‘ the statute or ‘enactment‘ claimed to establish the duty must at the very least be identified." (Searcy v. Hemet Unified School Dist. (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 792, 802.)      Plaintiffs allege that the City failed to ensure IHOP’s outdoor seating area complied with municipal codes governing restaurant conditions and failed to enact such code provisions. (FAC, ¶ 52.) Plaintiffs have not identified a statutory basis for such liability. Assuming such a duty exists, Plaintiffs are required to identify the statute and allege facts with specificity to support each statutory element. Moreover, as the City observes, it is immune from injury caused by failing to enforce a law. (Gov. Code, § 818.2.)  As a public entity’s liability “flows from the California Tort Claims Act,” Plaintiffs must also allege facts to show the cause of action “lies outside the breadth of any applicable statutory immunity.” (Keyes v. Santa Clara Valley Water Dist. (1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 882, 886.)      Plaintiffs’ opposition attempts to recast their claims as one arising from a dangerous condition of public property. Plaintiffs must allege facts demonstrating “(1) a dangerous condition existed on the public property at the time of the injury; (2) the condition proximately caused the injury; (3) the condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury sustained; and (4) the public entity had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition of the property in sufficient time to have taken measures to protect against it." (Brenner v. City of El Cajon (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 434, 439; Gov. Code, § 835.) Additionally, Plaintiffs must allege that "an unreasonable risk of harm is created by a combination of a defect in the property and acts of third parties.” (Zelig v. County of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.4th 1112, 1135).      Plaintiffs do not assert a claim under Government Code, section 835, nor does the FAC identify the defective condition on the City’s property. Rather, the negligence is based on the City’s failure to regulate IHOP’s outdoor seating area, which does not identify a condition of public property. (FAC, ¶51.)      All of the causes of action at issue here (wrongful death, survivor action, and negligent infliction of emotional distress) arise from these alleged facts and are defective for the foregoing reasons.V.      CONCLUSION      Plaintiffs have not alleged a statutory basis for liability against the City of Carson to support the first, second, and fourth causes of action. Accordingly, Defendant’s demurrer is SUSTAINED with 10 days leave to amend. (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now v. Department of Industrial Relations (1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 298, 302 [“Leave to amend is ordinarily given if there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured.”].)
