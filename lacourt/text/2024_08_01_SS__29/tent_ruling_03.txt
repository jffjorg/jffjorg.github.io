Background
On March
8, 2022, Jorge Alberto Santos (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Jose
Arthur Nestor (“Jose”) and Reina Nestor (“Reina”) (collectively “Defendants”),
and Does 1 through 100 for negligence arising out of an automobile accident
occurring on March 11, 2020.
Defendants filed an answer on October 11, 2023. 
On June 20, 2024, Defendants filed six motions
to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and Request for Production. Four of the motions were heard on
July 31, and the remaining two are set for hearing on August 1.
No opposition has been filed.
Legal
Standard
A party must respond to interrogatories within
30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party
to whom interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit
for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts are
required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide
a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (a).)
When a party moves to compel initial responses
to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must respond to requests for production
of documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to
provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)
When a party moves to compel initial responses
to requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has
engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary
sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020,
subd. (a).)
Discussion
On October 11, 2023, Defendant Reina served Plaintiff with Special
Interrogatories (Set One) and Requests for Production (Set One).  (Tsymbaloff
Decls., ¶ 3 & Exhs. A.)  Plaintiff has not responded to these
discovery requests.  (Id., ¶¶ 10-11.)
Defendant need not show anything more.  The motions to
compel Plaintiff to respond to the special interrogatories and the requests for
production are GRANTED. 
The requests for sanctions in connection with the motions to
compel responses to the interrogatories and requests for production are
DENIED. 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery” but does not independently
authorize sanctions for such conduct.
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 provides for the
imposition of sanctions against any party or attorney who engages in conduct
that is a misuse of the discovery process “[t]o the extent authorized by the
chapter governing any particular discovery method or any other provision of
this title [the Civil Discovery Act].”  This section, itself, does
not independently authorize sanctions.
In the chapters of the Civil Discovery Act governing
interrogatories and requests for production, the Legislature has authorized
sanctions in the context of a motion to compel initial responses “against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” the motion to
compel.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) & 2031.300,
subd. (c).)  Here, however, Plaintiff has not opposed the
motion.  Accordingly, sanctions are not authorized under the Civil Discovery
Act.

The Court GRANTS the Motions to Compel.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to serve code
compliant, written, verified responses, without objection, to Defendant Reina
Nestor’s Special Interrogatories (Set One) within 14 days of notice of this

Nestor’s Requests for Production (Set One) within 14 days of notice of this
order.

monetary sanctions.
