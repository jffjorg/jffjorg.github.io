  Case Number:  21STCV11146    Hearing Date:   August 1, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Compel the Deposition of Plaintiff Alphonso
Cunningham filed by Defendant Marc Nehme.
 
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
On March 23, 2021, Alphonso
Cunningham (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Mark Nehme, Jose Sanchez Glindo,
and Does 1 through 50 for negligence arising out an automobile accident
occurring on April 15, 2019. 
 
On September 1, 2021, Marc Nehme
(erroneously sued as Mark Nehme) (“Nehme”) filed his answer.
 
On November 22, 2022, Plaintiff amended
the complaint to name Pro-Tek Stone & Tile, Inc. (“Pro-Tek”) as Doe 1.
 
On September 12, 2023, Jose Sanchez Galindo
filed an answer.
 
This matter has been related to Jose
Sanchez, et al. v. Marc William Nehm, 21STCV05825, and Antonio Sliva, et al. v.
Marc W. Nehme, 21TSCV13953.
 
As it relates to the matter on calendar for August 1, Nehme
filed this motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff on June 5, 2024.  The hearing date was initially set for July
3.  There is no opposition in the Court
file, but it appears that an opposition may have been served (but not filed),
as Nehme filed a reply on June 26.
 
When the complaint was filed, a trial date of September
20, 2022 was assigned.  The trial date has
been continued several times.  On March
6, 2024, the Court continued the trial from that date to July 16, 2024; the
Court ordered that discovery remained closed except for two items: (1) a
medical examination of Plaintiff; and (2) fact and expert discovery relating to
Plaintiff’s continuing treatment.
 
At the Final Status Conference on July 2, 2024, the Court
continued the hearing on this motion to August 1 and the trial date to September
10, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
“Any
party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any
person, including any party to the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the
requirements for (among other things) what must be included in a deposition
notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice
must be served.  
“The
service of a deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a
party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and
copying.”  (Id., § 2025.280, subd.
(a).)
Section
2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at
least three days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition
notice does not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through
2025.280.
Section
2025.450, subdivision (a), provides:
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization
that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  
Any
such motion to compel must show good cause for the production of documents and,
when a deponent has failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.”  (Id.,
subd. (b).)  
When
a motion to compel is granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
Discussion
The
trial date in this matter has been continued several times.  Earlier this year, the trial was scheduled
for March 6, 2024.  On that date, the
Court continued trial to July 16, 2024 and ordered that discovery remained
closed except for: (1) a medical examination of Plaintiff; and (2) fact and
expert discovery relating to Plaintiff’s continuing treatment.  (Minute Order dated March 6, 2024.)
 
On May
9, 2024, Pro-Tek (not Nehme) noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for May 29, 2024.  (Selame Decl., Exh. A.)  Plaintiff did not appear.  (Id., ¶ 4.)
 
Nehme now
brings this motion to compel.
 
For at
least two independent, procedural reasons, the Court must deny the motion.
 
First, a
motion to compel a deposition must be filed by “the
party giving the notice” of the deposition. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)  Here, however, Defendant Pro-Tek noticed the
deposition, but it is Defendant Nehme who is filing the motion.  For that reason alone, the motion is denied.
 
Second,
and independently, the motion is not timely.
 
The motion
was filed on June 5, 2024, with a hearing date of July 3, 2024.  At the time, the trial date was July 16,
2024, and therefore the last day for discovery motions to be heard was July 1,
2024.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020,
subd. (a).)  Nehme did not file an ex
parte application or otherwise take any action to advance the hearing date.
 
On July
2, 2024, the Court continued both the hearing date (to August 1) and the trial
date (to September 10).  Nothing in the Minute
Order dated July 2, 2024, however, states or indicates that the Court extended
any discovery deadlines.  Absent a court
order, “a continuance or postponement of the trial date does not operate to
reopen discovery proceedings.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (b).)
 
In sum,
the hearing date was after the discovery cutoff when the motion was filed, and
no subsequent order of the Court extended any discovery deadline.
 
For
these reasons, the motion is denied.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court
DENIES Defendant’s motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff. 
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
