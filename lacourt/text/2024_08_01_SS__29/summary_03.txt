And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by 8601 Balboa LLC (Balboa) to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Patricia Parsons (Plaintiff). The demurrer is sustained, without leave to amend, as to the First Cause of Action, which alleges a dangerous condition of public property. This is because Balboa is a private entity and is not subject to a claim under Government Code section 835.

The demurrer is overruled as to the Second Cause of Action, which alleges negligence. The Judge finds that Plaintiff has pleaded facts sufficient to state a claim against Balboa under the Sidewalk Accident Doctrine. Plaintiff alleges that Balboa created the defect by planting a tree on its property that lifted the sidewalk, creating an unreasonable risk of harm to users of the sidewalk. The Judge is required to accept these allegations as true on demurrer.

The Judge has also granted Plaintiff's request for judicial notice of the claim for damages to City, dated May 2022. The request is denied as to the transcript of Plaintiff's deposition and City's document production, as these are not proper subjects of judicial notice.
