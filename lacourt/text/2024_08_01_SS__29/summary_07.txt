And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendant's motions to compel the plaintiff to respond to discovery requests, including form interrogatories and requests for production. The plaintiff failed to respond to these requests despite being served with them on January 16, 2024. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to respond waived all objections and that the plaintiff's subsequent responses included waived objections. The judge orders the plaintiff to serve verified responses without objections to the discovery requests. The judge also grants in part the defendant's requests for monetary sanctions, ordering the plaintiff and his attorneys to pay $1,350 for their failure to respond to discovery requests. The judge sets the sanctions on each motion in the amount of $675, based on one and a half hours of attorney time, multiplied by a reasonable rate of $450 per hour for work of this nature.
