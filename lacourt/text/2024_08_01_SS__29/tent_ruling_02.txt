to Supplemental Interrogatories
Motion to Compel Plaintiff Daniel Romero Garcia to Respond to Supplemental
Requests for Production 
 
Tentative
The motions to compel are granted.
The requests for sanctions are denied.
Background
On August 19, 2021, Daniel Romero Garcia (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Vanis Mikaelian (“Defendant”) and Lyft Corporation
for negligence arising out of an automobile accident occurring on August 22,
2021. 
 
Lyft Corporation filed an answer on March 2, 2023, and
Defendant filed an answer on April 26, 2023.
 
On June 4, 2024, Defendant filed motions to
compel Plaintiff’s responses to Supplemental Interrogatories and Supplemental
Requests for Production. Defendant also seeks sanctions.
No opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When
a party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
Discussion
On March 29, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiff
with Supplemental Interrogatories and Supplemental Requests for Production.  (Ross Decls., ¶ 3 & Exh. A.)  
Plaintiff has not responded to these
discovery requests.  (Id., ¶ 6.)
Defendant need not show anything more.
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motions to
compel Plaintiff to respond to Supplemental Interrogatories and Supplemental
Requests for Production.
Defendant’s requests for sanctions are DENIED.  
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery” but
does not independently authorize sanctions for such conduct.
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 provides
for the imposition of sanctions against any party or attorney who engages in
conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process “[t]o the extent authorized
by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or any other provision
of this title [the Civil Discovery Act].” 
This section, itself, does not independently authorize sanctions.
In the chapters of the Civil Discovery Act governing
interrogatories and requests for production, the Legislature has authorized
sanctions in the context of a motion to compel initial responses “against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” the motion to compel.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) &
2031.300, subd. (c).)  Here, however, Plaintiff
has not opposed the motion.  Accordingly,
no sanctions are authorized.
Conclusion
The Court
GRANTS the Motions to Compel Plaintiff Daniel Romero Garcia to Respond to Defendant Vanis Mikaelian’s Supplemental
Interrogatories and Supplemental Requests for Production.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to serve code compliant, written,
verified responses, without objection, to Defendant’s Supplemental
Interrogatories within 10 days of notice.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to serve code compliant, written,
verified responses, without objection, to Defendant’s Supplemental Requests for
Production within 10 days of notice.
The Court DENIES Defendant’s requests for monetary sanctions.
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
