Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Alphonso Cunningham, filed by Defendant Marc Nehme, is denied. The Court finds that the motion was not properly brought by Defendant Nehme, as it was Pro-Tek Stone & Tile, Inc. that noticed the deposition. Additionally, the motion was not timely, as it was filed after the discovery cutoff date. The Court notes that a continuance of the hearing date and trial date does not operate to reopen discovery proceedings. The Court DENIES Defendant's motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff.
