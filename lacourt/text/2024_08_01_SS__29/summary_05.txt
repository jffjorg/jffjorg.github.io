* "Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly."

Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Defendant's motion for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff Barrios, as there is no evidence of repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process or a history of abuse. The Judge has also denied Defendant's motion for issue and evidence sanctions against Plaintiff Sanchez, as Defendant has not provided an adequate basis for this request. However, the Judge has granted Defendant's request for monetary sanctions in part, imposing a sanction of $825 on Plaintiffs and their counsel for their failure to comply with the Court's orders and provide written discovery responses.
