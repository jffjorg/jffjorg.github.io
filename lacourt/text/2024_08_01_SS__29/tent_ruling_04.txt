 Case Number:  22STCV26628    Hearing Date:   August 1, 2024    Dept:  29 Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint filed by 8601
Balboa LLC.
 
Tentative
The demurrer is sustained, without leave to
amend, as to the First Cause of Action and overruled as to the Second Cause of
Action.
Background
On August 17, 2022, Patricia Parsons
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against City of Los Angeles (“City”) and Does 1
through 50 for damages based on a dangerous condition of public property
arising out of a fall on January 19, 2022 on uneven concrete on a sidewalk at
or near 8601 Balboa Boulevard in Los Angeles.
On December 9, 2022, City filed its answer to
the complaint and a cross-complaint against Roes 1 through 20.  On October 19, 2023, City amended the
cross-complaint to name 8601 Balboa LLC (“Balboa”) as Roe 1.
On February 1, 2024, Plaintiff amended her
complaint to name Balboa as Doe 1.
Also on February 1, 2024, Balboa filed its
answer to the cross-complaint and its own cross-complaint against City and Roes
1 through 50.
On April 16, 2024, City filed its answer to
Balboa’s cross-complaint.
Plaintiff and City have settled.  On May 6, 2024, the Court denied Balboa’s
motion to contest the good faith of a settlement between Plaintiff and
City.  The Court determined that the settlement is in good faith
under Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6.
On May 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
First Amended Complaint (“FAC”).  The FAC
asserts two causes of action: (1) dangerous condition of public property and (2)
negligence.
 
On July 3, 2024, Balboa filed its
demurrer to the FAC. Plaintiff filed an opposition on July 17; Balboa filed a
reply on July 25.
 
Legal
Standard
A demurrer is a pleading used to test
the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not
fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party's pleading
(complaint, answer or cross-complaint). (Code Civ. Proc., § 422.10; see Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) It is not the
function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and
for purposes of ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are
assumed to be true. (Id.)  
A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, supra, 116
Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) No other extrinsic evidence can be
considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868,
881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting
demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co.
(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal
v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider
contents of release not part of court record].)  
A demurrer can be utilized where the
“face of the complaint” itself is incomplete or discloses some defense that
would bar recovery. (Guardian North Bay, Inc. v. Superior Court (2001)
94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.) The “face of the complaint” includes
material contained in attached exhibits that are incorporated by reference into
the complaint; or in a superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v.
Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and
accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as surplusage the
pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”]).  
A demurrer can be sustained only when
it disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp.
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev.
Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.) 
Request
for Judicial Notice
Balboa requests that
the Court take judicial notice of: (1) the transcript of Plaintiff’s
Deposition, taken January 24, 2024; (2) Plaintiff’s claim for damages to City,
dated May 2022; and (3) City’s document production. 
The request is
granted as to item #2, the claim asserted by Plaintiff against City.  The Court takes judicial notice of the submission
of this document, but not the truth of the matters asserted therein.
The request is
denied as to items #1 and #3.  These are
not proper subjects of judicial notice. 
Meet and Confer Requirement
"Before filing a demurrer
pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person
or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to
demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached
that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.41(a).)
This requirement is satisfied
here.  (McKenzie Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.)
Discussion
Balboa demurs to both the first and second
causes of action in the FAC, asserting that each fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Balboa. 
Plaintiff’s First Cause of Action asserts a
claim under Government Code section 835 for a dangerous condition of public
property.  As Balboa is a private entity,
it is not subject to a claim under Government Code section 835.  Plaintiff concedes this point.
Accordingly, Balboa’s demurrer to the First
Cause of Action is sustained without leave to amend.
Plaintiff’s Second Cause of Action asserts a
common law claim for negligence.  Balboa’s
argument on demurrer is essentially that it did not owe any duty to Plaintiff
with regard to the sidewalk at issue because it is under City’s control, and
Balboa does not exercise control over the sidewalk.
For two independent reasons, the demurrer to
the Second Cause of Action is overruled.
First, Plaintiff alleges that Balboa
possessed, controlled, maintained, supervised, and owned the sidewalk at
issue.  (FAC, ¶ 38.)  Plaintiff may or may not be able to prove
this, but on demurrer the Court must accept the properly pleaded allegations in
a complaint as true.
Second, under the Sidewalk Accident Doctrine,
abutting property owners may have a duty to members of the public if the
property owner created the defect or exercised dominion or control over the
abutting sidewalk. (Lopez v. City of Los Angeles (2020) 55 Cal.App.5th
244, 255; Jordan v. City of Sacramento (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1487, 1490-91
[Section 5610 “imposes a duty of repair on the abutting property owners for
defects in sidewalks, regardless of who created the defects, but does not of
itself create tort liability to injured pedestrians or a duty to indemnify
municipalities, except where a property owner created the defect or exercised
dominion or control over the abutting sidewalk”]; see also Contreras v.
Anderson (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 188, 196; Jones v. Deeter (1984) 152
Cal.App.3d 798, 802-03.)  
Here, Plaintiff alleges that Balboa planted a
tree on its property that “lifted the sidewalk, creating an unreasonable risk
of harm to users of the sidewalk.”  (FAC,
¶ 40.)  In other words, Plaintiff alleges
that Balboa created the defect, and, again, on demurrer, the Court must accept
that allegation as true. 
Conclusion
The Court SUSTAINS, without leave to amend, the demurrer of Balboa
(Doe 1) to the First Cause of Action in the FAC.
The Court OVERULES the
demurrer of Balboa to the Second Cause of Action in the FAC.
Moving Party is
to give notice.
