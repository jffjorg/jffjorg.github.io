  - "Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly."
  - "A terminating sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a monetary discovery sanction is never justified."

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in response to the Defendant's motion for terminating, issue, evidence, and monetary sanctions against the Plaintiffs, Adela Sanchez and Andrez Barrios. The Court has denied the Defendant's motion for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff Barrios, finding that there has been no showing of a history or pattern of willful abuse or repeated violations that have not been (or cannot be) cured by lesser sanctions.

The Court has also denied the Defendant's motion for issue and evidence sanctions against Plaintiff Sanchez, finding that the request is unsupported by adequate evidence. However, the Court has granted the Defendant's request for monetary sanctions, imposing a sanction of $825 on the Plaintiffs and their counsel for failing to comply with court orders and provide written discovery responses.
