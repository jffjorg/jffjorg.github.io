Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge will consider the motion to continue the trial filed by the Uber Defendants. The opposition was filed late, but the Court will consider it. The Court finds that the mediation scheduled for September 25, 2024, is not a good cause for a continuance of trial. The Court also finds that the epidural injection and subsequent treatment of Plaintiff Muhamad Awadallah, and the motor vehicle accident of Plaintiff Denise Delgado, are not sufficient grounds for a continuance of trial. After careful consideration of all the evidence and arguments, the Court denies the motion to continue trial without prejudice. The moving parties are ordered to give notice.
