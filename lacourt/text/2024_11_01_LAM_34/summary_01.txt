Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge in a case involving George Santopietro, James Harden, and others. The case is about alleged damage to Santopietro's real property and various claims and counterclaims filed by the parties. The judge is considering a motion by North Beverly Park Homeowner’s Association, Inc. to bifurcate the trial, which means separating the trial of the claims against it from the trial of the other claims. The judge grants the motion, finding that bifurcation would promote judicial economy and efficiency. The judge concludes that the motion is granted as to North Beverly Park Homeowner’s Association, Inc. only.
