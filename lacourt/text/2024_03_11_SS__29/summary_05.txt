```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motions to compel the defendant's responses to written discovery, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The plaintiff served the defendant with these requests on February 6, 2023, but no responses have been received. The court finds that the plaintiff need show nothing more to demonstrate that the defendant has failed to respond to discovery, and therefore grants the motions to compel.

The court also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions, citing California Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, which states that sanctions must be authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or any other provision of the title. The court notes that the statutes governing interrogatories and requests for production do not provide an independent basis to award sanctions.

The court orders the defendant to serve verified, code-compliant written responses to the plaintiff's requests for discovery within 21 days of notice.
