And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively granted the motion to continue the trial date from April 30, 2024, to early October 2024. The defendant filed its motion for summary judgment and set the hearing for the court's first available dates in August 2024. The court found that good cause exists for a continuance due to the defendant's timely filing of its motion for summary judgment. The court considered the factors set forth in California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, including the proximity of the trial date, whether there was any previous continuance, and the length of the continuance requested. The court also considered the defendant's need to prepare for trial and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending trials. The court ordered the final status conference to be continued to September 26, 2024, and the non-jury trial to be continued to October 10, 2024.
