And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Lai's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court grants Lai's motion for judgment on the pleadings on the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh causes of action, which allege intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and concealment by Lai. The court denies Lai's motion for judgment on the pleadings on the Fourth cause of action, which alleges a violation of California Health and Safety Code section 13007. The court grants Galstyan leave to amend his complaint within 14 days of notice. The court finds that Galstyan's complaint does not adequately plead the elements of intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and concealment, and therefore, Lai is entitled to judgment on those causes of action.
