And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted Plaintiff Kary Law's motion for relief from dismissal. The Court finds that the dismissal was entered without the consent of Plaintiff's counsel, and therefore, the order of dismissal is void. The Court sets aside the dismissal entered on October 20, 2023, and orders a new Trial Setting Conference for May 13, 2024.
