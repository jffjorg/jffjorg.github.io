ANALYSIS:
 
Judgment
Creditor Andrew Krain (“Judgment Creditor”), in pro per, filed the instant
action for fraud against Alina Grygoryshyna (“Judgment Debtor”), also in pro
per, on July 6, 2020. Following Judgment Debtor’s failure to appear, the Court
entered default judgment in Judgment Creditor’s favor on January 4, 2021.
Judgment Creditor filed a Motion to Compel Third Parties to Produce Documents
(“first Motion”) to on September 25, 2023. Third-party Bank of Hope filed an
opposition on November 13, 2023 and third-party Sammy Hakim (“Hakim”) filed a
“Response to Subpoena for Production”, which partially opposed the first
Motion, on December 11, 2023. 
 
The
first Motion initially came for hearing on December 14, 2023, at which time the
Court granted the Motion in part and continued it in part. Specifically, the
Court granted Judgment Creditor’s request for production of Judgment Debtor and
Hakim’s confidential marriage license and continued the request for production
of documents from third-party financial entities to March 14, 2024. (Minute
Order, 12/14/23, pp. 1-2.) The request for production of documents by
third-party financial entities was continued to allow for clarity on the
question of the marriage of Judgment Debtor and Hakim. (Id. at p. 3.) On
February 9, 2024, the Court granted Judgment Creditor’s Motion for In Camera
Examination with respect to the confidential marriage license of Judgment
Debtor and Hakim. (Minute Order, 02/09/24.) Hakim also filed an Objection to
Third Party Subpoena on March 7, 2024.
 
Following
the in-camera hearing on March 25, 2024, the Court found that “there is a
Confidential Marriage License. Date of marriage is 3/5/22 which is after the
judgment date of 1/4/21.” (Minute Order, 03/25/24.) The first Motion was set to
be heard on April 8, 2024, but on the day before, Judgment Creditor continued
the matter to May 16, 2024. (Registrar of Actions, 04/07/24.) On May 16, 2024,
the Court denied the first Motion. (Minute Order, 05/16/24.) Also on that date,
the Court struck Judgment Creditor’s “Amended Motion to Compel Third Parties to
Produce Documents,” filed on May 6, 2024, which purported to supplant the
original Motion to Compel Third Parties to Produce Documents. (Ibid.)
 
Judgment
Creditor filed a renewed Motion to Compel Third Parties to Produce Documents
(“the Renewed Motion”) on May 20, 2024. Bank of Hope filed an opposition on May
30, 2024. On June 12, 2024, the Court heard oral argument from both parties and
then denied the Renewed Motion to Compel Third Parties to Produce Documents.
 
On
August 20, 2024, Judgment Creditor filed the instant second, renewed Motion to
Compel Third Parties to Produce Documents (“the Second Renewed Motion”). Third
party Bank of Hope filed an opposition on September 11, 2024.
 
Discussion
 
The
instant Second Renewed Motion to Compel seeks the same relief previously sought
and denied in the first Motion to Compel Third Parties to Produce Documents,
the Amended Motion to Compel Third Parties to Produce Documents, and the
Renewed Motion. (Second Renewed Motion, pp. 5:10-6:13.) Specifically, the
Second Renewed Motion to Compel Production is brought with respect to subpoenas
issued to (1) Sammy Hakim; (2) Bank Of Hope; (3) Bank Of America, N.A.; (4)
Capital One, N.A.; (5) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Newrez, LLC; (6) Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A.; (7) Chex Systems, Inc.; and (8) Lexisnexis Risk Solutions, Inc.
 
When a party seeks the same relief that was previously denied, it must
bring a renewed motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1008,
subdivision (b). (California Correctional Peace Officers Ass’n v. Virga (2010)
181 Cal.App.4th 30, 43, fn. 11; see also Tate v. Wilburn (2010)
184 Cal.App.4th 150, 156-157.) When a motion has been denied in whole or in
part, the moving party may apply again for the same relief at a later time only
upon “new or different facts, circumstances or law.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008,
subd. (b); see Graham v. Hansen (1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 965,
969-970.) Also, the statute requires the moving party “to show a satisfactory
explanation for failing to provide the evidence earlier, which can only be
described as a strict requirement of diligence” the purpose of which is to
incentivize parties “to efficiently marshall their evidence.” (Baldwin v.
Home Sav. of America (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1192, 1199 [citing Garcia
v. Hejmadi (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 674, 689-690].)
 
Judgment Creditor’s declaration pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1008 states that the Court’s denial of the original Motion to Compel on
May 16, 2024, following oral argument, was intended to be a denial without
prejudice. (Motion, Krain Decl., ¶¶8-13.) Yet nothing in the Court’s minute
order dated May 16, 2024 suggests that was the Court’s intention. Judgment
Creditor also declares that the Amended Motion to Compel, filed on May 6, 2024
was intended to include the new evidence provided by Bank of America, N.A. and
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. that should have submitted with the original Motion to
Compel. (Id. at ¶¶6-7.) Assuming this to be true, Judgment Creditor was
also required to show diligence in presenting this new evidence to the Court. A
review of the Amended Motion to Compel does suggest the existence of new
evidence from Bank of America, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The Amended
Motion contends that “on December 26, 2023 Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. produced
copies of additional Judgement Debtor’s bank deposit statements and deposit
records that were mailed directly to the court and are currently in possession
of the clerk at Department 26.” (Amended Motion, filed 05/06/24, ¶4.) Since
these documents were not delivered to the Court until after the hearing on the
first Motion to Compel Third
Parties to Produce Documents, and were brought to the Court’s attention at
Judgment Creditor’s next opportunity via the Amended Motion, the Court finds
the diligence requirement has been satisfied. Judgment Creditor also had filed an
amended supplemental declaration on January 16, 2024, which the Court did not
consider in connection with the first Motion to Compel because it was not filed
as if in connection with that motion and the Court was unaware of its
relevance. (Amended Supplemental Declaration, filed 01/18/24, p. 1.) Also, the
Amended Supplemental Declaration was not served on Judgment Debtor.
 
In light
of the bank records attached to Judgment Creditor’s Amended Supplemental
Declaration and in the Court’s possession, the Court continues the hearing on
the Judgment Creditor Andrew Krain’s Second Renewed Motion to Compel Third
Party Production of Documents for consideration of these documents.

Judgment
Creditor Andrew Krain’s Second Renewed Motion to Compel Third Party Production
of Documents is continued to December 18, 2024 at 10:00 am in Department 26 in
the Spring Street Courthouse. Judgment Creditor is to meet all the following
