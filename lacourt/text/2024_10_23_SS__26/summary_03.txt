And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Defendant City of Whittier. The Judge grants the motion and orders Defendant City of Whittier to file and serve a proposed judgment of dismissal from the Complaint within 20 days.

The motion was brought on the grounds that the Complaint fails to state a cause of action for premises liability against Defendant Whittier. The Judge finds that the Complaint does not allege a statutory basis for liability against Defendant Whittier and that the allegations are insufficient to support a claim against a public entity. The Judge also finds that public entities are immune from liability unless provided for in a statutory exception, and that the Complaint does not meet this standard.

The Judge notes that the Complaint does not allege the basis of any duty owed to Plaintiff by Defendant Whittier, or the manner in which it was negligent. The Judge further notes that public entities are immune from liability for failing to inspect private property for hazards, and that the Complaint does not allege any facts that would support a claim against Defendant Whittier for failing to inspect the Premises.

The Judge's ruling is based on the legal standards set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure section 438 and California Government Code sections 815, 818.6, and 835. The Judge's ruling is a tentative ruling and is subject to change after further consideration and the opportunity for the parties to submit additional briefing or argument.
