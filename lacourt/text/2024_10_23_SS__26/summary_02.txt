```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to reclassify the action from a limited to an unlimited jurisdiction court. The motion was filed after the deadline to amend the complaint and the plaintiff must show both that the case is incorrectly classified and good cause for the timing of the motion. The plaintiff has failed to provide adequate evidence of the possibility that their damages will exceed the jurisdictional limit of $35,000.00. The court finds that neither requirement to reclassify the action is satisfied and therefore denies the motion.
