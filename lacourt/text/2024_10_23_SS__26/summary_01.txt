And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court continues the hearing on Judgment Creditor Andrew Krain's Second Renewed Motion to Compel Third Party Production of Documents, which seeks to compel third parties to produce documents related to a lawsuit. The Court has set a new hearing date of December 18, 2024, at 10:00 am in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse.

To proceed with the motion, Judgment Creditor must meet certain requirements by the dates set forth. Specifically, Judgment Creditor must file proof of service of the Amended Supplemental Declaration and its contents on Judgment Debtor and third parties by November 20, 2024. Additionally, Judgment Creditor must file and serve a supplemental brief addressing the bank records attached to the Amended Supplemental Declaration by December 4, 2024.

The Court has also denied Judgment Creditor's previous motions to compel third parties to produce documents, and has required Judgment Creditor to show diligence in presenting new evidence to the Court. The Court finds that Judgment Creditor has satisfied this requirement by filing an Amended Supplemental Declaration and an Amended Motion to Compel Third Party Production of Documents, which include new evidence from Bank of America, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
