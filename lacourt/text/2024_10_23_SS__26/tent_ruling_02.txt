MOTION TO RECLASSIFY
(CCP
§ 403.040)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Aralhachig Manoogian’s
Motion to Reclassify is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
On March
8, 2023, Plaintiff Aralhachig Manoogian (“Plaintiff”) filed this action for
motor vehicle negligence against Defendant Victoria Cedillos (“Defendant”).
Defendant answered the Complaint on August 25, 2023. Plaintiff filed the
instant Motion to Reclassify the Action on August 20, 2024. Defendant filed an
opposition on October 9, 2024 and Plaintiff replied on October 15, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
 
The
Motion to Reclassify is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
403.040, subdivision (a), which allows a plaintiff to file a motion for
reclassification of an action within the time allowed for that party to amend
the initial pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (a).) The Motion,
however, does not cite the full statutory language as it omits the requirements
set forth in subdivision (b).
 
If the
motion is made after the time for the plaintiff to amend the pleading, the
motion may only be granted if (1) the case is incorrectly classified; and (2)
the plaintiff shows good cause for not seeking reclassification earlier. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (b).) In Walker v. Superior Court (1991)
53 Cal.3d 257, 262, the California Supreme Court held that a matter may be
reclassified from unlimited to limited only if it appears to a
legal certainty that the plaintiff's damages will necessarily be less than the
jurisdictional limit. (Walker v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d
257.)
 
In Ytuarte
v. Superior Court (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 266, 278, the Court of
Appeals examined the principles it set forth in Walker and
held that “the court should reject the plaintiff's effort to reclassify the
action as unlimited only when the lack of jurisdiction as an “unlimited” case
is certain and clear.” (Id. at 279.) Plaintiffs’ burden is
to present evidence to demonstrate a possibility that the damages will exceed
[the jurisdictional limit] and the trial court must review the record to
determine “whether a judgment in excess of [the jurisdictional limit] is
obtainable.” (Ibid.) The jurisdictional limit, effective January
1, 2024, is $35,000.00. (Code Civ. Proc., § 85, subd. (a).)
 
Discussion
 
As the
instant Motion was filed after the time to amend the complaint, Plaintiff must
show both that the case is incorrectly classified and good cause for the timing
of the Motion. The Motion does not adequately address the timing of the request
to reclassify, which was filed more than a year after Defendant’s answer.
Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration simply states that when the action was
originally filed, they believed the damages would not exceed $25,000.00. (Id.
at ¶2.) Further research apparently demonstrates that Plaintiff’s damages will
far exceed the jurisdictional limit. (Ibid.) However, the manner and
timing of this “further research” is not explained. Nor does the Motion offer
any authority for what constitutes “good cause” under the statute to persuade
the court that a vague assertion of “further research” is sufficient.
 
Second,
the Motion does not present any evidence from the record regarding the
possibility that Plaintiff’s damages will exceed $35,000.00. Without any
supporting details, Plaintiff’s counsel declares the damages will “far exceed”
the jurisdictional limit of this court, which they incorrectly believe to be
$25,000.00. (Ibid.) Similarly, Defendant mistakes the jurisdictional
limit to be $10,000.00 less than what has been statutorily set as of January 1,
2024. (Oppo., p. 2:23-24.) That Defendant propounded discovery appears to be
for an unlimited jurisdiction case, therefore, does not demonstrate the
possibility that Plaintiff’s damages will exceed $35,000.00.  
 
Therefore,
the Court finds that neither requirement to reclassify the action to the
unlimited jurisdiction court is satisfied.
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Aralhachig Manoogian’s
Motion to Reclassify is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
