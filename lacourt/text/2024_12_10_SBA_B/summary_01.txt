Summary in English:

The tentative ruling denies a motion for summary judgment brought by Defendant Devanand Sharma (also known as Frank Martini) in a lawsuit filed by Plaintiff Cynthia A. Blanks. The defendant filed the motion on November 7, 2024, but failed to provide the required 75-day notice before the hearing date of December 10, 2024. The plaintiff argues that the motion is invalid due to the lack of notice, and the court agrees, citing California Code of Civil Procedure section 437c. The court also notes that the defendant improperly based the motion on a federal rule, rather than the applicable California statute. The motion is denied without prejudice, and the defendant may re-file the motion once the statutory requirements are met.
