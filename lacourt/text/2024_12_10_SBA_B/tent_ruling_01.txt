BACKGROUND
On December 22, 2022, plaintiff
Cynthia A. Blanks, as trustee of The Cynthia A. Blanks Revocable Trust #2 and
as trustee of The Seanjay Ramanand Sharma Revocable Trust filed a complaint
against Devanand Sharma aka Frank Martini (and nominal defendants 4200 West
Century Associates, 4229 West 101st Street Associates, and 4223
Associates) for (1) declaratory relief and (2) accounting.
On March 1, 2023, defendant (self-represented)
filed a cross-complaint against Cynthia A. Blanks, Seanjay R. Sharma, Kamelia
Yagadari, and Satanand Sharma for (1) breach of fiduciary duty, (2) breach of
implied covenant of good faith and dealing, (3) fraud, (4) conversion, (5) constructive
trust, (6) accounting, (7) quiet title action, (8) methodone clinics purchased
with defendant’s property, and (9) declaratory relief.
On September 19, 2023, cross-complaint
(represented by counsel Walton Law Group) filed a FACC for (1) declaratory
relief and (2) accounting.
On March 28, 2024, the Court
granted defendant’s motions to compel further responses against the nominal
defendants.
On April 15, 2024, the Court denied
without prejudice plaintiff’s motion for an order to deposit all future rent
payments to nominal defendants.
On June 21, 2024, defendant filed a
substitution of attorney replacing Walton Law Group with himself.
On November 7, 2024, defendant
filed a motion for summary judgment, setting the motion for hearing on December
10, 2024.
On November 21, 2024, defendant
filed a motion to amend the date of the summary judgment motion, re-setting if for
hearing on February 13, 2025.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
The purpose of a motion for summary
judgment or summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.”  Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal. 4th 826, 843.  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal. App. 4th 1110, 1119.
“On a motion for summary judgment,
the initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie
showing that there are no triable issues of material fact.”  Scalf
v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal. App. 4th 1510, 1519.  A defendant moving for summary judgment or
summary adjudication “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of
action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the
cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete
defense to the cause of action.”  CCP §
437c(p)(2).  “Once the defendant . . .
has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.” CCP § 437c(p)(2).  
“When deciding whether to grant
summary judgment, the court must consider all of the evidence set forth in the
papers (except evidence to which the court has sustained an objection), as well
as all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence, in the light
most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.” Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal. App.
4th 463, 467; CCP §437c(c).
Importantly, the court does not decide
disputed issues of fact in a summary judgment motion.  As an example, if one person said the light
was green and 100 other people said it was red, the court still could not grant
the motion, since there is a factual dispute shown by the evidence.  The court is NOT empowered in a summary
judgment motion to decide which of two versions of the facts the court finds
most credible.  The court must deny a
motion if there is a material factual dispute, even if the court believes one
version is more credible than the other.
Finally, Code of Civil Procedure § 437c(a)(2) states that,
“[n]otice of the motion and
supporting papers shall be served on all other parties to the action at least
75 days before the time appointed for hearing.”
 
DISCUSSION
Defendant
Devanand Sharma (self-represented) requests summary judgment “pursuant to
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56.” 
(This is not a federal court and it does not follow the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure.)  The motion was filed
on November 7, 2024, and noticed for hearing on December 10, 2024.
In the
opposition, plaintiff contends that the motion failed to provide at least 75
days’ notice before the hearing as required by CCP § 437c(a)(2).  Plaintiff requests that the Court take the
motion off calendar or set a new hearing date at least 75 days after the date
of the Court’s order.
The Court
notes that defendant filed a “motion” on November 21, 2024 to “amend the date
of the summary judgment motion,” which is set for hearing on February 13,
2025.  Defendant acknowledges that he
failed provide the required notice.
The Court finds that the motion has
failed to provide the statutory time period for notice.  CCP §437c(a)(2) states that,
“[n]otice of the motion and
supporting papers shall be served on all other parties to the action at least
75 days before the time appointed for hearing.”
If the notice is served by mail to
an address within the State of California, the 75-day period is increased by five
days.  Defendant provided only
thirty-three days’ notice.  The Court
lacks power to change the notice and filing periods of section 437c.  See McMahon v. Superior Court (2003)
106 Cal. App. 4th 112, 117 (“In sum, we hold that, in light of the express
statutory language, trial courts do not have authority to shorten the minimum
notice period for summary judgment hearings.”).
The Court also finds that the
motion is improperly based on a federal rule, as opposed to the applicable
California statute for motions for summary judgment.
The motion is thus DENIED WITHOUT
PREJUDICE.  Moving party may start over
and comply with the statutory requirements of Civil Code § 437c.  All of
the statutory requirements.  See California
Rule of Court 3.1350.
