And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion by the defendants, Aiden Cole Berlinger and Jason Berlinger, to conduct a mental status examination on the plaintiff, Walter Andrade, with Dr. Barry Ludwig. The plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that it is untimely and that the examination is not necessary. The judge finds that the motion is timely and that good cause has been shown to grant the motion. The judge orders that the examination be conducted on February 28, 2024, at 9:00 a.m., and that the plaintiff shall appear for the examination. The judge also orders that the defendants provide notice of the court's order and file a proof of service of such.
