Plaintiff appears to have objected to the mental status test during the initial
March 7, 2023 examination on the basis that it was duplicative of the
neuropsychological tests already performed. (See Mendoza Decl. ¶ 5, Exh. C.)
However, in the opposition, Plaintiff does set forth specifically how it is
duplicative, nor provide evidence refuting Dr. Ludwig’s declaration that the
tests are necessary to diagnose Plaintiff’s neurological complaints. (Opp., 6.)
