Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Jose Martin's motion to reopen discovery to conduct depositions of Defendant Angelina & Katherine Garden, LLC's owners and person most knowledgeable (PMK). The Court finds that the motion is untimely and that Plaintiff has not established good cause to reopen discovery. The Court also notes that Defendant has already expended substantial time ensuring its retained experts are prepared to testify for trial and that multiple continuances and opportunities to conduct discovery have been provided in the case. The Court declines to award monetary sanctions and denies the motion to reopen discovery.
