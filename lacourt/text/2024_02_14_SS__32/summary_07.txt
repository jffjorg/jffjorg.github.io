And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants in part the defendant's motion to continue trial. The defendant had filed a motion for summary judgment and requested that the trial be continued to allow for the motion to be heard. The court finds good cause to continue trial because the defendant's motion for summary judgment needs to be heard before the start of trial. The trial is continued to April 7, 2025, and the final status conference is continued to March 24, 2025.
