And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Estate of Robert Ishii's Motion for Summary Judgment/Adjudication. The motion was denied because the Court found that Plaintiff Stewart Nakabayashi has raised a triable issue of fact regarding whether Mr. Ishii was negligent in failing to seek medical treatment that would have decreased his chance of suffering the subject stroke.

The Court's decision is based on the evidence presented by the parties, including medical records and expert testimony. The Court found that Mr. Ishii suffered a stroke while driving, but there is a dispute over whether his failure to seek medical treatment contributed to the stroke.

The Court rejected Defendant's argument that Mr. Ishii's risk of stroke was unpredictable and that a reasonably prudent person would have anticipated a medical emergency. The Court also rejected Defendant's argument that Plaintiff's argument surrounding Mr. Ishii's negligence was outside the pleadings.

Instead, the Court found that Plaintiff has raised a triable issue of fact and that the motion for summary judgment/adjudication should be denied. The Court's decision means that the parties will need to proceed to trial to resolve the dispute.
