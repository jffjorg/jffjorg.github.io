  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s request for court judgment by
  default
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Anthony Brown
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       n/a
Request for Court Judgment by Default
Plaintiff Anthony Brown
(“Plaintiff”) requests that the court enter default judgment in his favor and
against defendant Pablo Davila (“Defendant”). 
As a threshold matter, the
court notes that Plaintiff has requested inconsistent relief in his supporting
papers.  On the mandatory “Request for
Entry of Default” Judicial Council form, Plaintiff has requested that the court
enter default judgment in the amount of $40,000.  (CIV-100, ¶ 2, subd. (a).)  However, in the supporting memorandum of
points and authorities, Plaintiff requests that the court enter default
judgment in the total amount of $52,416.13, consisting of $40,000 in damages,
$11,738.16 in interest, and $675 in costs. 
(Memo. filed June 18, 2024, p. 1:18-20.) 
The requests for interest and costs should have been included on the
mandatory Judicial Council form. 
(CIV-100, ¶¶ 2, subds. (c), (d), 7.) 

The court exercises its
discretion to consider Plaintiff’s application for default judgment
notwithstanding this error. 
First, the court finds that
Plaintiff is entitled to damages in the maximum amount of $40,000 because
Plaintiff (1) prayed for $40,000 in damages in the Complaint (Compl., p. 7,
Prayer, ¶ 1), and (2) has proven that he suffered damages in the total amount
of $52,835 consisting of (i) the loss of Plaintiff’s 50 percent interest in the
aircraft, totaling $30,000 (Brown Decl., ¶ 5), (ii) the $7,490 paid to recover
the aircraft and to bring it to Los Angeles (Brown Decl., Ex. D [$7,490
invoice]), and (iii) a total of $15,345 expended by Plaintiff in storage fees
for the period of 31 months at the monthly rate of $495 (Brown Decl., ¶ 5
[Plaintiff incurred storage fees from November 2021 to June 2024, i.e., 31
months]; Brown Decl., Ex. E)[1].  (Code Civ. Proc., § 580, subd. (a) [“The
relief granted to the plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot exceed that
demanded in the complaint . . . .”]; CSAA Ins. Exchange v. Hodroj (2021)
72 Cal.App.5th 272, 276 [elements of breach of contract]; O’Neal v.
Stanislaus County Employees’ Retirement Assn. (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 1184,
1215 [elements of breach of fiduciary duty].) 
Second, the court finds that
Plaintiff’s request for interest is supported by the interest calculations of
his counsel.  (Civ. Code, § 3289; Biggins
Decl., ¶ 2.)  Third, the court finds that
the costs requested are permitted by Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5,
subds. (a)(1), (a)(4); Biggins Decl., ¶ 3.)
The court therefore grants
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment against Defendant in the total amount
of total amount of $52,416.13.
The court will modify, sign,
and file the Court Judgment by Default (Judicial Council form JUD-100)
consistent with this order. 
The court directs the clerk to
give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:  July 18, 2024
