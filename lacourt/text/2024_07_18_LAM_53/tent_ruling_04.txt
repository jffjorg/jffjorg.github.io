RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant FCA US LLC
(1)  
Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories
(2)  
Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of Documents
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with each
motion. 
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO
SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES
Plaintiff Kenneth Leonhardt
(“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order compelling defendant FCA US LLC
(“Defendant”) to serve further responses to Plaintiff’s Special
Interrogatories, Set One, numbers 14, 20, 39, and 43. 
The court notes that, in its
opposition, Defendant has submitted the declaration of its counsel, in which
counsel states that Defendant (1) “supplemented its responses [to Special
Interrogatories numbers 14 and 20] to include the names and addresses of the
service advisors it believed to have performed service on the subject vehicle[,]”
and (2) “agreed to produce a corporate representative to testify at deposition
regarding the decision whether or not to repurchase the subject vehicle in
response to” Special Interrogatories numbers 39 and 43.  (Gregg Decl., ¶¶ 7, 11.)  Although Defendant attached a copy of
Defendant’s supplemental responses to those interrogatories, Defendant did not
file a proof of service establishing that those responses have been served on
Plaintiff.  (Gregg Decl., Ex. B [Supp.
Response].)  Moreover, Plaintiff’s reply
does not appear to indicate that Plaintiff received the supplemental
responses.  
Thus, the court evaluates
Plaintiff’s motion based on the responses that Defendant served on September
15, 2023.  (Yakoobian Decl., Ex. O; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 409 [“Whether a particular response does resolve
satisfactorily the issues raised by a motion is a matter best determined by the
trial court in the exercise of its discretion, based on the circumstances of
the case”].) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s
motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to Special Interrogatories,
numbers 14 and 20 because (1) Defendant’s exercise of the option to produce
documents under section 2030.230 is unwarranted, and (2) the objections to those
interrogatories are without merit.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subds. (a)(2), (a)(3).) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s
motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to Special Interrogatories,
numbers 39 and 43 because the objections to those interrogatories are without
merit.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subd. (a)(3).) 
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO
REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
Plaintiff moves the court for an order compelling Defendant to serve
further responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One,
numbers 7, 10, 20, 24, 25, 44-52, 53-55, and 56-65.
In its opposition, Defendant asserts that it has since supplemented
its responses to this discovery.  (Gregg
Decl., ¶ 8.)  However, although Defendant
has filed a copy of “Defendant FCA US LLC’s Supplemental Response to
Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents to Defendant (Set One),” dated
March 28, 2024, Defendant did not attach a proof of service establishing that
it served the supplemental responses on Plaintiff.  (Gregg Decl., Ex. B, pp. 1-25 [Supp.
Responses].)  Moreover, in his reply,
Plaintiff asserts that he has not received those supplemental responses.  (Reply, p. 1:17-22 [“Plaintiff is only in
possession of Defendant’s initial responses dated September 15, 2023”].)  The court therefore evaluates Plaintiff’s
motion based on the responses that Defendant served on September 15, 2023.  (Yakoobian Decl., Ex. N; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 409.)
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
response to Requests for Production of Documents, number 7 because (1) the
statement of compliance is incomplete since it does not state that all
documents or things in the demanded category that are in Defendant’s
possession, custody, or control and to which no objection is being made will be
included in the production, and (2) the objections in the response are without
merit.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.310,
subd. (a)(1), (a)(3), 2031.220.)
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 10 and 24-25 because
the objections in the responses to those demands are without merit.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(3).) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
response to Requests for Production of Documents, number 20, limited to the
production of documents evidencing policies and procedures regarding the
handling of repeat complaints by customers regarding their vehicles.   
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 44-46, 47 (first),
47 (second), 48-52, and 62-65, limited to the requested documents for vehicles
purchased in California for the same year, make, and model of the subject
vehicle.
The court denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 53-61 because those
demands are overbroad and unduly burdensome. 
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiff Kenneth
Leonhardt’s motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories. 
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.300, the court orders defendant FCA US LLC to serve further, full
and complete answers to plaintiff Kenneth Leonhardt’s Special Interrogatories,
numbers 14, 20, 39, and 43, which
comply with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.210-2030.250, within 20 days
of the date of this order. 
            The
court grants in part plaintiff Kenneth Leonhardt’s motion to compel
further responses to requests for production of documents as follows. 
            The court orders defendant FCA US
LLC (1) to serve on plaintiff Kenneth Leonhardt further written responses,
which comply with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2031.210-2031.250, to
plaintiff Kenneth Leonhardt’s Requests for Production of Documents (i) numbers 7,
10, and 24-25, (ii) number 20, limited to the production of documents
evidencing policies and procedures regarding the handling of repeat complaints
by customers regarding their vehicles, and (iii) numbers 44-46, 47 (first), 47
(second), 48-52, and 62-65, limited to the requested documents for vehicles
purchased in California for the same year, make, and model of the subject
vehicle, and (2) to produce to plaintiff Kenneth Leonhardt all documents and
things in defendant FCA US LLC’s possession, custody, or control which are
responsive to those requests (and limited as set forth above), within 20 days
of the date of this order. 
            The court orders plaintiff Kenneth
Leonhardt to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
