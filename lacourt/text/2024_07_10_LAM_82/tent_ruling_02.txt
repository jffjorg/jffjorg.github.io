Order
Denying Petition for Relief from Late Claim
 
            Petitioner Charroma Dixon seeks leave to file a late tort claim against a public entity
pursuant to Government Code section 946.6. 
Petitioner alleges that on or about December 25, 2022, she was injured
after stepping into an open hole or uneven pavement near 7509 South Broadway in
Los Angeles, California.  Government Code
section 911.2(a) states that “a claim relating to a cause of action for death
or for injury to person or to personal property . . . shall be presented . . .
not later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action.”  If written notice of the rejection or
inaction (which amounts to a rejection) on the claim is tendered pursuant to
section 913, the claimant has six months from the time the written notice is
personally delivered or deposited in the mail to file suit against the public
entity.  (Gov. Code § 945.6(a)(1).)  This six-month period expired on June 25,
2022, and no claim was submitted before the deadline.
 
            Petitioner retained counsel on July
27, 2023.  If a claimant fails to submit
a claim within six months, the claimant may make a written application to the
public entity for permission to present a late claim within a reasonable time
but not to exceed one year from the accrual of the cause of action.  (Gov. Code § 911.4(a)-(b).)  Therefore, on December 22, 2023, Petitioner’s
counsel filed an application for leave to present a late claim under Government
Code section 911.4.  The County denied
the application on January 2, 2024, and the City denied the application on
January 23, 2024.[1]  This petition follows.      
 
            If an application for leave to
present a late claim is denied by the public entity, a petitioner may file a
petition before the court.  (Gov. Code §
946.6(a).)  The petition must demonstrate
that the application was made to the public entity and was actually or
effectively denied.  (Gov. Code §
946.6(b)(1).)  Petitioner must articulate
the reason(s) for not presenting the claim within the time period.  (Gov. Code § 946.6(b)(2).)  Finally, the petitioner must include all of
the information required by Government Code section 910.  (Gov. Code § 946.6(b)(3).)  The court “shall” relieve the petitioner from
the requirements of section 945.4 if the application was made in a timely
manner and was actually or effectively denied if “[t]he failure to present the
claim was through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect unless
the public entity establishes that it would be prejudice in the defense of the
claim if the court relieves the petitioner from the requirements of Section
945.5.”  (Gov. Code § 946.6(c).)[2]  
            Petitioner does not establish good
cause, as required by section 946.6(c)(1). 
Petitioner provides no credible explanation or evidence why she did not
file a claim during the six-month time period between December 25, 2022, and
June 25, 2023.  The petition is not
accompanied by a declaration from Petitioner, and the petition itself
articulates no reason why Petitioner could not have filed a timely claim.  In fact, the petition contains no facts making
clear what, if anything, Petitioner did during the six-month period to attempt
to submit a claim or making clear why she was unable to do so.  In other words, Petitioner does not satisfy her
burden of establishing that her mistake was “reasonable,” and that her neglect
was “excusable.”  This is required:  
 
Although the statutes
refer, as a requirement for relief, to “mistake, inadvertence, surprise or
excusable neglect,” only “neglect” is qualified by the adjective “excusable.”  However, it is uniformly held that for relief
on any or all of the stated grounds it must be shown that one’s misconception
was reasonable, or that it might have been the conduct of a reasonably prudent
person under similar circumstances.
 
(Kaslavage v. West
Kern County Water Dist. (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 529, 539 fn.1, quoting Shaddox
v. Melcher (1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 598, 601).  Instead, the petition makes only a generic
argument: 
 
Counsel for Plaintiff
noted that due to the COVID crises [sic], which was unfolding during the
relevant time period, statutes of limitations were extended, governmental
attorneys and departments were closed, inaccessible, or otherwise difficulty
[sic] to communicate with and obtain information due to the stay home orders
and social distancing requirements.  
 
(First Amended Petition at
11:16-21.)  Generic arguments by
counsel—unsupported by a declaration from Petitioner—are insufficient.  As discussed, Petitioner identifies no
specific facts or circumstances suggesting that the pandemic affected her
ability to submit a timely claim between December 25, 2022, and June 25,
2023.  Simply, if the court granted this
petition on this record, it would effectively have to “toll” the six-month
deadline for every plaintiff who was injured at any point during the existence
of Covid-19.  
 
            Petitioner attempts to rely on the state of emergency
declared by the Governor on or about March 4, 2020, and the subsequent Covid-19
emergency orders, like Emergency Rule 9, which tolled statutes of limitations over
180 days from April 6, 2020, until October 1, 2020.  Emergency Rule 9 expired on June 30, 2022,
and this accident happened approximately six months later, on December 25,
2022.  There is no basis to apply
Emergency Rule 9 or any other Covid-related tolling to this case at such a late
stage.    
 
            Petitioner’s counsel argues that there was an error in
submitting the application for relief from late claim, which was submitted on
December 22, 2023, and he seeks relief under Code of Civil Procedure section
473(b).  In fact, the application was
submitted within one year of the accrual of the claim and therefore was
timely.  Rather, the court denies the
petition on the merits because Petitioner cannot establish good cause for not
having submitted the claim within the six-month period.  
 
            The court has considered Petitioner’s arguments and finds
none to be persuasive.  The court need
not reach Respondents’ arguments that they would be prejudiced if the court
granted this petition.  Based upon the
foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
1.         Petitioner’s petition for relief from
the claims requirement is denied.
 
2.         This signed order shall constitute the
judgment in this case.  
 
3.         The court’s clerk shall provide notice.
 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
