Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition for writ of mandate filed by Kathy Smith and CaliRX Wellness Company (Petitioners) against the City of Los Angeles, Department of Cannabis Regulation, et al. (Respondents). The Petitioners had challenged a decision by the City denying a commercial cannabis license, and sought a declaratory judgment.

The Court ruled that the Petitioners failed to meet their burden of proof under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, as they did not file an opening brief or lodge the administrative record. The Court also found that the Petitioners' claims concerning the Business Tax Registration Certificate (BTRC) have already been litigated in a previous case, St. Andrews Pharmacy LLC v. St. Andrews Green, et al., and are therefore barred by res judicata.

Additionally, the Court found that the City's decision was supported by substantial evidence, and that the Petitioners' claims are without merit. The Court denied the petition for writ of mandate and issued a judgment in favor of Respondents on the complaint for declaratory relief.
