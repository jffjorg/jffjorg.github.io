And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied the petition for relief from the claims requirement filed by Charroma Dixon, a plaintiff who was injured on December 25, 2022, after stepping into an open hole on a public property in Los Angeles. Dixon sought to file a late tort claim against the City of Los Angeles and other public entities, but her application for leave to present a late claim was denied by the public entities. The judge ruled that Dixon did not establish good cause for not filing a claim within the six-month period and that her petition was not accompanied by a declaration from Dixon or any specific facts or circumstances suggesting that the pandemic affected her ability to submit a timely claim. The judge also denied Dixon's attempt to rely on the state of emergency declared by the Governor and the subsequent Covid-19 emergency orders, which tolled statutes of limitations over 180 days. Finally, the judge ruled that the court need not reach the Respondents' arguments that they would be prejudiced if the court granted the petition.
