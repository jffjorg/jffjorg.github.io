[Tentative]
Order Issuing Judgment in Favor of Respondents 
and Against
Petitioner on the Complaint for Declaratory Relief
 
 
NOTICE
 
            The

not appear at the hearing, she shall waive the right to be heard and shall
submit to entry of this tentative order as the final order in this case.  
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
            Petitioners
Kathy Smith and CaliRX Wellness Company (collectively, “Petitioners”) filed
this petition for writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5
on May 17, 2021.  Petitioners challenge a
decision by the City of Los Angeles, Department of Cannabis Regulation (the
“DCR”) denying a commercial cannabis license. 
Petitioners also seek a declaratory judgment against the City of Los
Angeles, Office of Finance.  The petition
for writ of mandate is denied.  The court
issues a judgment in favor of Respondents, and against Petitioner, on the
complaint for declaratory relief.     
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5(b), the pertinent issues are whether the
respondent has proceeded without jurisdiction; whether there was a fair trial;
and whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.  An abuse of discretion is established if the
agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law; the decision is not
supported by the findings; or the findings are not supported by the
evidence.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5(b).
 
DISCUSSION
 
            A.        The Company Cannot Proceed as a
Self-Represented Party 
 
            CaliRX
Wellness Company (the “Company”) was represented by counsel when this case was
filed on May 17, 2021.  On June 14, 2022,
the original counsel for the Company filed a “Substitution of Attorney—Civil”
form designating a new attorney, Ms. Ronda Nadine Baldwin-Kennedy.  The form was signed by Petitioner Kathy Smith
in her capacity as “CEO of CaliRX Wellness Co.” 

 
Ms. Baldwin-Kennedy and Ms. Smith
both appeared at the trial setting conference on December 7, 2022.  Ms. Baldwin-Kennedy represented that she
would not be representing Petitioners. 
The minute order does not indicate that Ms. Smith objected.  Therefore, the court (Beckloff, J.) relieved
Ms. Baldwin-Kennedy as counsel.  The
Company has not retained new counsel. 
Because the Company cannot appear as a self-represented party, the court
denies the writ and issues a judgment in favor of Respondents on the complaint
for declaratory relief.  
 
B.        Petitioners
have not satisfied their burden under section 1094.5
 
An agency is
presumed to have regularly performed its official duties.  (Evid. Code § 664.)  The petitioner
seeking administrative mandamus has the burden of proof and must cite to the
administrative record to support its contentions.  (See Bixby v. Pierno (1971) 4 Cal. 3d 130,
143; Steele v. Los Angeles County Civil Service Commission, (1958) 166 Cal.
App. 2d 129, 137; see also Alford v. Pierno (1972) 27
Cal.App.3d 682, 691 [“[T]he burden of proof falls upon the party attacking the
administrative decision to demonstrate wherein the proceedings were unfair, in
excess of jurisdiction or showed prejudicial abuse of discretion.”].)  “[A] trial court must afford a
strong presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings.” (See
Fukuda v. City of Angels (1999) 20
Cal. 4th 805, 817.)  A reviewing court
“will not act as counsel for either party … and will not assume the task of
initiating and prosecuting a search of the record for any purpose of
discovering errors not pointed out in the briefs.”  (Fox v.
Erickson (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d 740, 742.)
 
Accordingly, a
memorandum of points and authorities is required for a noticed mandamus motion.
 (See Code Civ. Proc. § 1094; Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1113(a).)   The
absence of a memorandum is an admission that the motion is not meritorious and
may be denied.  (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1113(a).)  “The memorandum must
contain a statement of facts, a concise statement of the law, evidence and
arguments relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks
cited in support of the position advanced.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1113(b); Quantum Cooking Concepts, Inc.
v. LV Associates, Inc. (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 927, 934 [Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1113 “rests on a policy-based allocation of resources, preventing
the trial court from being cast as a tacit advocate for the moving party's
theories”].)  
 
“In a section
1094.5 proceeding, it is the responsibility of the petitioner to produce a
sufficient record of the administrative proceedings; ‘... otherwise the
presumption of regularity will prevail, since the burden falls on the
petitioner attacking the administrative decision to demonstrate to the trial
court where the administrative proceedings were unfair, were in excess of
jurisdiction, or showed’ prejudicial abuse of discretion.”  (Elizabeth
D. v. Zolin (1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 347, 354; see also Eureka Citizens for Responsible Government v. City of Eureka (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 357, 366 [“Failure to provide an adequate record concerning an
issue challenged on appeal requires that the issue be resolved against the
appellants.”])
 
In this case,
Petitioners have not filed an opening brief or lodged the administrative
record.  Petitioners have had ample time
to do so.  The petition was filed on May
17, 2021, and Respondents filed an answer on August 12, 2021.  The trial setting conference was continued
multiple times due to Petitioners’ failures to appear.  Finally, at a trial setting conference on
December 6, 2023, the court (Beckloff, J.) set trial for the current date: July
10, 2024.  Petitioners never filed an
opening brief or lodged the administrative record.  Accordingly, Petitioners have not met their burden
of proof under section 1094.5 to show a prejudicial abuse of discretion, a
denial of a fair trial, or other reversible error in the administrative decision.  Therefore, the petition for writ of mandate
is denied.  
 
C.          Petitioners
are not Entitled to Declaratory Relief  
 
            To
the extent Petitioners challenge findings made in the administrative decision,
their sole remedy is in administrative mandate. 
(See Rezai v. City of Tustin (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 443, 448 [“An
action for declaratory relief is not appropriate to review the validity of an
administrative decision.”].)  Therefore, the
court issues a judgment in favor of Respondents on the complaint for
declaratory relief.  
 
            D.        Petitioners did not Name Necessary and
Indispensable Parties 
 
            The
declaratory relief action seeks a declaratory judgment that “BTRC number
0002350758-0001-8 should be assigned to CALIPRX and that BTRC number
0002350758-0001-8 does not belong to St. Andrews Green.”  Petitioners allege that Arnold Abramyan
fraudulently filed a Statement of Information with the California Secretary of
State alleging that he was the Chairman of St. Andrews Green.  (Pet. ¶¶ 22-23.)  Petitioners also seek a declaration that “a
new BTRC number 3047961-0001-9 was properly issued to [Arnold] Abramyan and St.
Andrews Green, a Cooperative Corporation (Entity No. C4131658).”  (Pet. ¶ 68.) 
Accordingly, St. Andrews Green and Abramyan are necessary and
indispensable parties in whose absence a judicial declaration cannot issue.  (See Code Civ. Proc. § 389; Oppo. 17-19.)  Therefore, the court issues a judgment in
favor of Respondents on the complaint for declaratory relief.  
 
            E.         Res Judicata/Collateral Estoppel
 
            Petitioners’
claims concerning the Business Tax Registration Certificate (“BTRC”) have
already been litigated.  The court grants
Respondents’ request for judicial notice, per Evidence Code section 452(d).  The court (Sotelo, J.) held a bench trial in
St. Andrews Pharmacy LLC v. St. Andrews Green, et al., Case Number
BC701226.  Petitioner Kathy Smith was a
party and was represented at trial by Albert Robles, Esq.  (See RJN Exh. B at 1.)  The case involved a single issue: The true
holder of a 2007 Business Tax Registration Certificate issued by the City of
Los Angeles for a marijuana business. 
(See ibid.)  Judge Sotelo
found as follows:
 
The initial BTRC issued to the “St. Andrews Green” on March
17, 1008, [sic] was identified as BTRC 0002262794-0002-8 (hereinafter “BTRC
794”).  (See Trial Ex. 177.)  According to the testimony of Brent Santos,
shortly thereafter, BTRC 794 was somehow merged or was blended into BTRC number
0002350758-0001-9 [sic] (hereinafter “BTRC 758”). 
 
(Ibid.)  There was a typographical error in Judge
Sotelo’s statement of decision, as the judgment makes clear the true number of
BTRC 758 was 0002350758-0001-8, which is the same license number in the instant
case.  (See RJN Exh. C; see also Oppo. at
12 fn. 3.)  Judge Sotelo found that Petitioner
Kathy Smith fraudulently diverted BTRC 758 and found that she had no lawful
claim to the license:
 
It is clear to the Court that as of 2013 when Smith was
working to fraudulently divert BTRC 758, Smith had no interest in the Original
St. Andrew’s Green or BTRC 758. . . . 
Smith’s statements in her bankruptcy schedules are completely
inconsistent with her claim of a continuing ownership in the Original St.
Andrew Green, including BTRC 758, after her bankruptcy discharge in 2009.  Even if Smith held any such interest before,
after the sale to Hakamian, Smith is judicially estopped to claim any further
interest in the Original St. Andrew’s Green, or BTRC 758, after her bankruptcy
discharge in 2009.  Accordingly, the
Court finds that Smith held NO INTEREST in the Original St. Andrew’s Green, or
BTRC 758, after 2009. . . .  The evidence
reflects that Smith has an established pattern and practice of attempting to
sell the “paperwork” on dispensaries that she does not own. . . .  The Court further concludes that Smith knew
she had no rights to the BTRC 758 REGISTRATION, and that her action in
diverting BTRC 758 violate [sic] the provisions of Penal Code section 496,
which entitles SAP to treble damages from Smith. 
 
(RJN Exh. B at 7-9, citations
omitted, emphasis in original.) 
Petitioner Kathy Smith cannot relitigate the dispositive issue in Case
Number BC701226 in the instant case. 
Therefore, the court denies the petition for writ of mandate and issues
a judgment in favor of Respondents on the complaint for declaratory
relief.    
 
            F.         The City’s Decision was Supported by
Substantial Evidence 
 
            Finally,
based upon the administrative record lodged by the City, it appears that the
City’s decision was supported by substantial evidence.  Therefore, even if the court reached the
merits, the petition for writ of mandate would be denied.
