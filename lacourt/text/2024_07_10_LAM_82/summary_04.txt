And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Plaintiff's application for a writ of possession against the Defendant, Matthew Christopher Thomas, without prejudice. The Plaintiff, First Technology Federal Credit Union, seeks to repossess a 2022 Tesla Model X vehicle (VIN 7SAXCBE69NF333811) that the Defendant allegedly wrongfully detains. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has satisfied the requirements for a writ of possession, including showing probable cause to believe that the vehicle is wrongfully detained and that the Plaintiff has the right to repossess the vehicle. However, the Judge denies the application because the Plaintiff did not provide sufficient evidence to establish probable cause to believe that the vehicle is located at the address specified in the application. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff's declaration appears to be based on hearsay and that the record suggests that the Plaintiff does not actually reside at the address listed in the application.
