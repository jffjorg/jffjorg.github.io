And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling by the judge addresses a motion for leave to amend the complaint in a habitability action arising from a bed bug infestation. The plaintiffs, Purner, et al., are seeking to add three new causes of action to their complaint against the defendants, Greystone Properties, LLC, et al. The judge grants the motion, finding that the policy favoring amendment and resolving all matters in the same dispute is strong and that the plaintiffs have complied with the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324. The judge notes that the plaintiffs' counsel states that additional facts and violations of the plaintiffs' rights were discovered during the deposition of Josh Wolf on May 14, 2024, and that the proposed first amended complaint seeks to "clean up" allegations and errors in the complaint while adding the new causes of action. The judge finds that the defendants would not be prejudiced by the amendment, as they have not taken any depositions of the plaintiffs and do not file an opposition.
