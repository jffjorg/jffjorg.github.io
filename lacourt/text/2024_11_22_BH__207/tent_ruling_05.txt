MATTER


Request
  for Default Judgment



 
This breach of contract case arises from a dispute regarding the
amount of back rent Defendants allegedly owe Plaintiff in connection with a
residential property lease.
 
On September 26, 2022, Plaintiff SM 10000 Property LLC (“Plaintiff”)
brought suit against tenant Defendants Nicolai Bergman (“Nicolai”), Amanda
McDermott-Bergmann (“Amanda”), and Nicolai Bergmann KK (“Nicolai KK”)
(together, “Defendants.”)  Amanda
answered the complaint, but default was entered against Nicolai and Nicolai KK
on August 10, 2023.
 
On July 18, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment
as to Amanda.  Plaintiff now seeks
default judgment against Nicolai and Nicolai KK in the amount of $303,862.69,
representing special damages in the amount of $255,003.28; prejudgment interest
in the amount of $35,394.16; costs in the amount of $3,465.25 and attorneys’
fees in the amount of $10,000.
 
A.    Damages
 
            Plaintiff’s
Complaint alleges a single cause of action for breach of contract.  Nicolai and Nicolai KK were personally served
with a copy of the summons and complaint on July 8, 2023.  Default was entered against Nicolai and
Nicolai KK on August 10, 2023.  The Doe
defendants have not yet been dismissed.  
 
            As
a threshold matter, the Court cannot enter the default judgment as requested
while the Doe defendants remain in the litigation.
 
            Further,
Plaintiff’s Complaint seeks $200,000 in damages, but Plaintiff now seeks
$255,003.28 in damages.  However, the Court
cannot award damages that are in excess of what is pled in the Complaint. (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 580, subd. (a) [“The relief granted to the plaintiff, if there is
no answer, cannot exceed that demanded in the complaint”]; Levine v.
Smith (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 1131,
1136-1137 [“when recovering damages in a default judgment, the plaintiff is
limited to the damages specified in the complaint”].)  
 
            Therefore, the Court cannot award
the requested $255,003.28 in damages.
 
B.    Prejudgment Interest
 
            Although
Plaintiff has provided an itemization of the amount of prejudgment interest
sought for each month from May 2022 through December 2023 (See Olsen Decl. ¶ 9)
the principal balance upon which prejudgment interest is being calculated for
each month is unclear.  To the extent
Plaintiff seeks prejudgment interest on a principal damage balance that exceeds
the requested $200,000, such prejudgment interest is improper.  

 
C.    Attorneys’ Fees and Costs
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033.5, which outlines recoverable costs to a prevailing party under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, permits the recovery of attorneys’ fees
when authorized by contract, statute, or law. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).)  Code of Civil Procedure section 1021 provides
“[e]xcept as attorney’s fees are specifically provided for by statute, the
measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to
the agreement, express or implied, of the parties [….]”  Similarly, Civil Code section 1717 provides
“[i]n any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that
attorney’s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be
awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party
who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she
is the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable
attorney’s fees in addition to other costs.” 
(Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a).)
 
The Code of Civil Procedure defines the “prevailing party” as follows:

 
[T]he party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a
dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains
any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any
relief against that defendant. If any party recovers other than monetary relief
and in situations other than as specified, the “prevailing party” shall be as
determined by the court, and under those circumstances, the court, in its
discretion, may allow costs or not and, if allowed, may apportion costs between
the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules adopted under
Section 1034.
 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)
 
            Paragraph 34 of the lease agreement
provides:
 
34. ATTORNEY'S FEES: In the event of any litigation to enforce
this Lease, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable
attorney's fees, not to exceed a total of ten thousand dollars ($10,000), and
costs of litigation.
 
(Ex.
1 to Browne Decl.)
 
            Therefore, Plaintiff is entitled to
the requested $10,000 in attorneys’ fees.
            
            Plaintiff also requests $3,465.25 in costs, but
Plaintiff has not specified in paragraph 7 of form CIV-100 the breakdown for
the requested costs.  Therefore, the
Court cannot determine whether the requested costs are appropriate.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
            For the foregoing
reasons, Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is denied.  
 
            Further, the
Court orders Plaintiff to file an amended default judgment request in
conformance with the Court’s ruling on or before December 31, 2024.  The Court also sets an Order to Show Cause re
Entry of Default Judgment on January 31, 2025 at 8:30 A.M. in Department
207.  Counsel for Plaintiff shall appear
in person at the Order to Show Cause hearing, unless the default judgment is
entered in advance of the hearing.  
 
            The Clerk of the
Court shall provide notice of the Court’s orders.
