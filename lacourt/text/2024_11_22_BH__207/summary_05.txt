As for the English-text summary, here is a brief summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

This ruling addresses a breach of contract case where Plaintiff SM 10000 Property LLC is seeking default judgment against Defendants Nicolai Bergman, Amanda McDermott-Bergmann, and Nicolai Bergmann KK. The Plaintiff seeks damages in the amount of $303,862.69, prejudgment interest, costs, and attorneys' fees. However, the Judge finds that the Plaintiff's request for damages in excess of the amount pled in the Complaint is not allowed. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff's request for prejudgment interest is improper because the principal balance upon which the interest is being calculated is unclear. The Plaintiff is entitled to $10,000 in attorneys' fees, but the request for costs is denied because the breakdown of the requested costs is not specified. The Judge denies the Plaintiff's request for default judgment and orders the Plaintiff to file an amended default judgment request. The Court sets an Order to Show Cause re Entry of Default Judgment for January 31, 2025.
