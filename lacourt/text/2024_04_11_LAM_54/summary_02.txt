And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling addresses the motion to set aside default and the demurrer to the complaint. The Court grants the motion to set aside default, finding that the defendants' signatures on the notice of acknowledgment were not dated, and they were told to re-sign the notice on February 2, 2024, which is an adequate showing of excusable mistake. The Court also overrules the demurrer to the complaint, finding that the plaintiff has alleged ultimate facts and provided sufficient detail of the defendants' alleged wrongdoing.
