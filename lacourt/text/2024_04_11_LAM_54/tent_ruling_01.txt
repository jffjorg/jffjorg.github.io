Responding Party: None
 
T/R:       THE MOTIONS ARE GRANTED. COUNSEL TO

COUNSEL TO NOTICE.
 
The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received.
 
The Court may issue an order allowing
an attorney to withdraw from representation, after notice to the client.  (CCP § 284.) 
The attorney may withdraw from representation where the withdrawal would
not result in undue prejudice to the client’s interest—for example, counsel
cannot withdraw at a critical point in the litigation.  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.
App. 4th 904, 915; see California Rule of Professional Conduct 3-700.) 
 
Excelsis Law, PC, counsel of record for
Plaintiffs, seek to withdraw from representation of Plaintiffs. Counsel state
that attorney-client communication has broken down. Trial is set for July 1,
2024; no prejudice will result from counsel’s withdrawal. Counsel have complied
with CRC 3.1362. 
 
There is good cause for counsel’s
withdrawal. The motions are GRANTED.
