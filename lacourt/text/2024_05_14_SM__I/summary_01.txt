And here is the English-text summary:

The court has reviewed the motion for nonsuit and has made a tentative ruling. The motion is granted in part and denied in part. The court believes there is sufficient evidence to send the case to the jury on the claims of breach of contract and common count for goods and services rendered. The court finds that the jury could conclude that the goods were ordered and delivered, and that the damages are not the price plaintiff is out of pocket, but the amount of the invoice not paid.

The court grants the motion as to open book and account stated, as there is no evidence of a formal accounting book. The court also grants the motion as to good faith and fair dealing, as there is no term in the contract. The court notes that the defendant referred to a case, but could not find the pertinent case and therefore did not consider it.

The court will consider the impeachment question and the exhibits attached to the complaint. The court requires the plaintiff to show a direct contradiction between something defendant has said on the witness stand and a statement made by or attributable to him in the communications. The court will not entertain argument on the point during trial.

The court will not give certain jury instructions, including CACI 209, 210, 223, 325, 330, 337, 372, 373, 3900, 5004, 5007, 5020, and 5021. The court will modify certain instructions and has made a tentative ruling on statute of limitations.
