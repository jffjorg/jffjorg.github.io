Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has reviewed the demurrer filed by the defendants (Edan Dahan, Israel Dahan, and Builders Green Remodeling, Inc.) to the second cause of action of the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by the plaintiff (OSB Investment, LLC). The second cause of action alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duty to the plaintiff.

The Judge has sustained the demurrer to the extent that the plaintiff has failed to allege facts sufficient to establish the existence of a joint venture between the parties, which is a necessary element of a claim for breach of fiduciary duty. The Judge has also sustained the demurrer to the extent that the plaintiff has failed to allege facts sufficient to establish the element of control required for a joint venture.

The Judge has given the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint and has ordered the plaintiff to file and serve an amended complaint, if any, within 20 days of the date of the order. If no amended complaint is filed, the defendants are ordered to file and serve their answer within 30 days of the date of the order.

The Judge has also ordered the defendants to give notice of the order.
