[1]Lastly, the Court notes that Defendants also argue
that “adding a new cause of action while [Defendants’] MSJ is pending is
prejudicial.” (Opp’n at p. 4:20.) Defendants note that on February 17, 2023,
they filed a motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative summary
adjudication. Defendants state that “the MSJ was directed at allegations in
Plaintiff’s FAC filed in May 2022.” (Opp’n. at p. 5:2-3.) It appears that on
May 25, 2023, Defendants filed another motion for summary judgment, or in the
alternative summary adjudication. However, after Defendants’ motions were filed
on February 17, 2023 and May 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative SAC on
January 26, 2024. The Court notes that in JKC3H8 v.
Colton (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 468,
477, the Court of Appeal found that “[a]n amendatory pleading
supersedes the original one, which ceases to perform any function as a
pleading. The amended complaint furnishes the sole basis for the cause of
action, and the original complaint ceases to have any effect either as a pleading
or as a basis for judgment…Because there is but one complaint in a civil
action…the filing of an amended complaint moots a motion directed to a prior
complaint…once an amended complaint is filed, it is error to grant summary adjudication
on a cause of action contained in a previous complaint…” (Internal
