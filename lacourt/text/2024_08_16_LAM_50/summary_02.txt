And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering the defendants' argument that adding a new cause of action while their motion for summary judgment is pending is prejudicial. The defendants note that they filed a motion for summary judgment in February 2023, which was directed at allegations in the plaintiff's original complaint filed in May 2022. However, after the defendants' motions were filed, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint (SAC) on January 26, 2024. The court cites a previous case, JKC3H8 v. Colton, which states that an amended complaint supersedes the original one and ceases to have any effect as a pleading or basis for judgment. The court notes that this means that the filing of an amended complaint moots a motion directed to a prior complaint. Therefore, the court is inclined to dismiss the defendants' argument that adding a new cause of action is prejudicial.
