And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ordered a meet and confer (Informal Discovery Conference or "IDC") between the parties to resolve their discovery disputes, rather than holding a hearing on August 16, 2024. The parties must participate in person in the IDC, and Plaintiffs must file a one-page IDC form in the department seven days prior to the IDC date, with the responding parties filing their responses three days prior. The parties are ordered to have all necessary materials for the IDC session and to attempt to resolve as many of the issues as possible before the IDC date. If the parties resolve their discovery disputes before the IDC date, Plaintiffs are ordered to take both the IDC and the motion off calendar as soon as possible.
