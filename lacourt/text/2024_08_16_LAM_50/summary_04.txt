And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has written a tentative ruling on a hearing scheduled for August 16, 2024, regarding a plaintiff's request for default judgment against two defendants, Donald Orval Shaw and Advanced Tactics, Inc. The plaintiff, Torrance Flite Park, LLC, seeks a judgment of $125,467.38, which includes damages, interest, and costs.

The Judge notes that the submitted default judgment package has some defects. First, the plaintiff's complaint does not appear to allege how the promissory note was breached. Second, a cause of action is not attached to the complaint. Third, there is a typo in the plaintiff's request for court judgment, listing "Daniel Orval Shaw" instead of "Donald Orval Shaw".

The Judge also notes that the plaintiff did not provide the original promissory note, as required. The Judge cites California Rules of Court and several court cases to support the ruling.

Based on these defects, the Judge denies the plaintiff's request for default judgment without prejudice, meaning the plaintiff can re-file the request once the defects are corrected.
