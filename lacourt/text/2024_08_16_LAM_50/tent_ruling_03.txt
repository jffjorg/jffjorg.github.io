  ORDER RE: 
  
 
PLAINTIFF’S
  MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO SET ONE OF PLAINTIFF’S DISCOVERY
 



 
Plaintiffs Jose Urbano Luna Valian and Josefina Luna (jointly,
“Plaintiffs”) move for 
an
order compelling Defendant FCA US LLC to respond to “Plaintiff’s” Form
Interrogatories, Set One; Special Interrogatories, Set One; Requests for
Admissions, Set One; and Requests for Production of Documents, Set One.  
Plaintiffs’ motion will be continued to a new date as set forth below. NO
HEARING WILL TAKE PLACE ON AUGUST 16, 2024. 
Pursuant to the Court’s power to “amend and control its process and
orders so as to make them conform to law and justice” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128,
subd. (a)(8)), the Court orders the parties in this case to participate in a
meet and confer with the Court (“Informal Discovery Conference” or “IDC”). Lead
or other designated counsel for the parties with full authority are ordered to
participate in person in an IDC. After consulting with opposing counsel
regarding available dates, Plaintiffs must make a prompt reservation for the
IDC using the Court’s online reservation system. Plaintiffs must file Dept.
50’s one-page IDC form in the department seven days prior to the IDC, and the
responding parties may file the same form in the department setting forth a
response three days prior to the IDC.¿    
Once Plaintiffs have confirmed an IDC date, Plaintiffs must use the
Court’s online reservation system to continue the motion to a post-IDC
discovery hearing date. The parties are ordered to have with them whatever
materials are needed to make the IDC session productive and successful. Prior
to the IDC date, lead or other designated counsel for the parties, with full
authority, are to meet and confer, in person or via telephone
in a further attempt to resolve as many of the issues as possible before
the IDC. (See CRC Rule 3.670, subd. (f)(2).) If the parties resolve
their discovery disputes before the IDC date, Plaintiffs are ordered to take
both the IDC and the motion off calendar as soon as possible.¿ 
Plaintiffs are ordered to provide notice of this Order.¿
