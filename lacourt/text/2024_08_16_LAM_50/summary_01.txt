And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a third amended complaint, which seeks to add an additional cause of action for fraudulent concealment against the defendants. The motion is opposed by the defendants, who argue that it is untimely and prejudicial. The court finds that the motion is indeed untimely, as it was served one day late, and that there is no justification for the delay. The court also notes that the supporting declaration does not comply with the mandatory requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324. Therefore, the court denies the motion for leave to file a third amended complaint, without prejudice.
