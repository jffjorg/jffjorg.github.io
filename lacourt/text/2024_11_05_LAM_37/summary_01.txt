```

And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is that Defendant Daleyn's demurrer to the Fourth Amended Complaint is sustained in its entirety without leave to amend. The court finds that Plaintiff Yenawine lacks standing to bring suit on behalf of Boyle Flats Food & Beverage, Inc. because the corporate bylaws do not permit the President to act without board approval. The court also finds that Plaintiff Yenawine fails to show that he can bring suit against Defendant Daleyn in his individual capacity rather than as President of Boyle Flats Food & Beverage, Inc. The court notes that this is the third demurrer to Plaintiff's pleadings and that Plaintiff Yenawine has failed to show a reasonable possibility of successful amendment.
