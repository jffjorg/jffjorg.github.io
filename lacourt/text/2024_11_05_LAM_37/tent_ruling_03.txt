Background
 
On July 3, 2023, Infinity Medical
Alliance, Inc. (“Plaintiff” or “IMA”) filed a Complaint against A&G
Management Services, Inc. (“A&G”); Aram Sharnazyan (“Sharnazyan”); and Does
1 to 50.  
 
The
Complaint alleges four causes of action: (1) Breach of Contract, (2)
Declaratory Relief, (3) Trespass-Monetary and Injunctive Relief; and (4)
Conversion.  
 
On
August 7, 2023, Defendants A&G and Sharnazyan filed a Cross-Complaint
(“CC”) against IMA, Larisa Vinnitskaya; Nikita Baranovskiy, Nixpro Inc.;
Konstantin Khlevnoy, Johnathan M. Quick, Jonathan Bohun, and Roes 1 to
50.  
 
Cross-Defendants IMA
and Larisa Vinnitskaya (“Vinnitskaya”) demurred to the Cross-Complaint (“CC”).
On December 15, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer to the Cross-Complaint
with leave to amend.  
 
On March 21, 2024,
Cross-Complainants filed the Second Amended Cross-Complaint (“SACC”) alleging
eleven causes of action:  
 
1)    
Breach
of Contract – against IMA and Roes 1 to 50; 
2)    
Intentional
Misrepresentation – against all Cross-Defendants;  
3)    
Negligent
Misrepresentation – against all Cross-Defendants;  
4)    
Breach

50;  
5)    
Receipt
of Stolen Property (Pen. Code § 496(c)) – against all
Cross-Defendants;  
6)    
Conversion,
against all Cross-Defendants;  
7)    
Intentional
Interference with Contractual Relations - against Vinnitskaya, Baranovskiy,
Nixpro, Khlevnoy, Quick, Tran, and Bohun;  
8)    
Intentional

Khlevnoy, Quick, Tran, and Bohun; 
9)    
Negligent

Khlevnoy, Quick, Tran, and Bohun; 
10) Unfair Business Practices (Bus. &
Prof. Code § 17200, et seq.)- against IMA, Vinnitskaya, Baranovskiy, and
Nixpro; and 
11) Conspiracy – against all
Cross-Defendants. 
 
On July 12, 2024, the
Demurrer by Cross-Defendants IMA and Larisa Vinnitskaya to the SACC was
overruled as to the first cause of action and sustained without leave to amend
as to the second, third, fourth fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth,
and eleventh causes of action.
 
On July 12, 2024, the
Demurrer to the SACC by Cross-Defendants Dat. C. Tran, Konstantin Khlevnoy, and
Jonathan Quick was sustained with leave to amend as to the second, third,
seventh, eighth, and ninth cause of action and without leave to amend as to the
fifth, sixth, and eleventh causes of action. 
On July 12, 2024, the
Demurrer to the SACC by Cross-Defendants Nixpro Inc. (“Nixpro”), Nikita
Baranovskiy (“Baranovskiy”) and Jonathan Bohun (“Bohun”) (collectively “Nixpro
Cross-Defendants”) was sustained with leave to amend as to the second, third,
seventh, eighty, and ninth causes of action and sustained without leave to
amend as to the fifth, sixth, tenth, and eleventh causes of action. 
 
On July 24, 2024,
Defendant/Cross-Complainant A&G and Aram Sharnazyan filed the operative
Third Amended Cross-Complaint (“TACC”) alleging the following six causes of
action: 
 
1)    
Breach of Contract against IMA and
Vinnitskaya;
2)    
Intentional Misrepresentation against
Baranovsky, Nixpro, Khlevnoy, Quick, Tran, and Bohan;
3)    
Negligent Misrepresentation against
Baranovsky, Nixpro, Khlevnoy, Quick, Tran, and Bohan;
4)    
Breach of Implied Covenant of Good
Faith and Fair Dealing against Baranovsky, Nixpro, Khlevnoy, Quick, Tran, and
Bohan;
5)    
Intentional Interference with
Contractual Relations against Baranovsky, Nixpro, Khlevnoy, Quick, Tran, and
Bohan;
6)    
Intentional Interference with
Prospective Economic Relations against Baranovsky, Nixpro, Khlevnoy, Quick,
Tran, and Bohan; and
7)    
Negligent Interference with Prospective
Economic Relations against Baranovsky, Nixpro, Khlevnoy, Quick, Tran, and
Bohan. 
 
On July 25, 2024, IMA
voluntarily dismissed the first cause of action as to Defendant Vinnitskaya
only. 
 
Cross-Defendants
Nixpro Inc. (“Nixpro”), Nikita Baranovskiy (“Baranovskiy”) and Jonathan Bohun
(“Bohun”) (collectively “Nixpro Cross-Defendants”) and Cross-Defendants Dat
Tran (“Tran”), Konstantin Khlevnoy (“Khlevnoy”), and Jonathan Quick (“Quick”) (collectively
“Cross-Defendants”) have filed demurrers to the TACC. Defendants/Cross-Complainants
A&G and Sharnazyan oppose both demurrers. The matter is now before the
court.
 
LEGAL STANDARDS
 
A.        Demurrer 
 
A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(CCP, § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d
311, 318.)¿“To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts
sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might
eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.”¿(C.A. v.
William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th
861, 872.)¿For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the
demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded.¿ (Aubry v.
Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.)¿A demurrer “does
not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.”¿(Daar v.
Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿ 
 
B.        Motion to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP, § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP, § 436(a)-(b);
Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading
which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are
surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
C.        Leave to Amend 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally granted
to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
Demurrer[1]
 
I.         Request for Judicial Notice 
 
The Court may
take judicial notice of records of any court of record of the United States.
(Evid. Code, § 452(d)(2).) However, the court may only judicially notice the
existence of the record, not that its contents are the truth. (Sosinsky v.
Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1565.) 
 
Cross-Defendants
Dat C. Tran, Konstantin Khlevnoy, and Jonathan Quick request judicial notice of
the following: 
 
1)     The
Court’s Ruling Sustaining the Demurrer of Cross-Defendants to the Second
Amended Cross-Complaint which is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.
 
Cross-Defendants’ request for
judicial notice is granted.
 
II.        Discussion
 
A.        Summary
of Allegations in SACC 
 
Cross-Defendant
Infinity Medical Alliance, Inc. (“IMA”) is the holder of an adult-use and
cannabis business license and is the owner of a cannabis business located in
Torrence, CA (the “Business”). (TACC, ¶¶ 4, 16.) Larisa Vinnitskaya
(“Vinnitskaya”) is the Chief Executive Officer of IMA. (Id., ¶ 5.)
Cross-complainant Aram Sharnazyan (“Sharnazyan”) owns and operates A&G
Management Services, Inc. (“A&G”). (Id., ¶¶ 2, 17.) On or about
September 25, 2019, IMA and A&G entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”)
wherein A&G would be the exclusive manager and operator of the Business. (Id.,
¶ 18, Ex. 1.)  
 
In
June 2020, A&G and Baranovskiy formed a partnership that allowed
Baranovskiy to run the day-to-day operations of the A&G. (TACC, ¶ 21.)
Baranovskiy retained his associates Khlevnoy, Quick, Tran, and Bohun as 11
personnel to manage the Business's day-to-day operations. (Id., ¶ 22.)
By July 4, 2023, the partnership between IMA and A&G was terminated due to
alleged nonpayment of taxes and failing to pay the reduced monthly fee that
A&G asserts IMA accepted. (Id., ¶¶ 32-35.)
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainants
A&G and Aram Sharnazyan have filed a TACC against Cross-Defendants on the
basis that they made misrepresentations to A&G and interfered with
A&G’s contractual and economic relationships. 
 
B.        Second and Third Causes of Action –
Negligent and Intentional Misrepresentation 
 
“The
essential elements of a count for intentional misrepresentation are (1) a
misrepresentation, (2) knowledge of falsity, (3) intent to induce
reliance, (4) actual and justifiable reliance, and (5) resulting damage.
[Citations.] The essential elements of a count for negligent
misrepresentation are the same except that it does not require knowledge of
falsity but instead requires a misrepresentation of fact by a person who has no
reasonable grounds for believing it to be true. [Citations.] Each element of a
fraud count must be pleaded with particularity so as to apprise the defendant
of the specific grounds for the charge and enable the court to determine
whether there is any basis for the cause of action, although less specificity
is required if the defendant would likely have greater knowledge of the facts
than the plaintiff. [Citation.]”  (Chapman v. Skype Inc. (2013)
220 Cal.App.4th 217, 230–231.) Negligent misrepresentation requires that the
party owe a duty to disclose. (See Goonewardene v. ADP, LLC (2019) 6
Cal.5th 817, 841; Levine v. Blue Shield of California (2010) 189
Cal.App.4th 1117, 1136.)  
 
The
second and third causes of action allege that “Baranovskiy, orally represented
to Cross-Complainants that he and his associates would operate the Business in
a diligent and honest manner on behalf of Cross-Complaints and for
Cross-Complainants' benefit, including but not limited to properly documenting
transactions/sales, retaining all cash from transaction/sales in the cash
register, depositing monies into the correct account(s) as instructed by
Cross-Complainants.” (TACC, ¶¶ 22, 55, 68, 76.) This allegation does not amount
to a misrepresentation because it is an opinion regarding a future event about
how A&G would be operated. “The law is well established that actionable
misrepresentations must pertain to past or existing material facts. [Citation.]
Statements or predictions regarding future events are deemed to be mere
opinions which are not actionable. [Citation.]” (Cansino v. Bank of
America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469.)
 
Next,
Cross-Complainant alleges that in March 2023, A&G’s accountant, Emilio
Amaran, discovered that Cross-Defendants were committing theft, fraud, and
embezzlement. (TACC, ¶ 25.) Baranovskiy, Khlevnoy, Quick, Tran, and/or Bohun
would claim to sell accessories and apparel on A&G’s software but were in
fact selling cannabis products. (Id., ¶¶ 27, 26.) When confronted by
A&G, Baranovskiy could not provide proof of any apparel or accessories. (Ibid.)
Afterwards “Baranovskiy, Khlevnoy, Quick, Tran, and/or Bohun shortly 20
thereafter devised a new fraudulent scheme” wherein they would input a 50%
discount on sales while charging customers full price and embezzling the
additional cash paid. (Id., ¶ 28.) Moreover, Cross-Defendant
Baranovskiy, Khlevnoy, Quick, Tran, and/or Bohun would deposit cash from the
register, include monies from their scheme, into the ATM and when the ATM
cassettes were full, they would each deposit the case into a bank account
belonging to Beranovskiy or Nixpro. (Id., ¶ 62.) In June 2023, A&G
discovered the fraudulent scheme and terminated the partnership with
Baranovskiy. (Id., ¶ 30.)
 
The
court finds that the TACC sufficiently alleges representations regarding
embezzlement of A&G’s products by misrepresenting the products sold and
their price on Meadow, the point-of-sale system software utilized by A&G.
(TACC, ¶ 26.) As a whole, the TACC alleges that the Cross-Defendants knew that
the Meadow transactions were not accurate because of their engagement in the
embezzlement scheme but intentionally or negligently misrepresented the
products sold or the price of said products on Meadow, A&G relied on the
representations by continuing its business relationship with Baranovskiy and
Nixpro, such that had A&G known about the misrepresentations sooner, it
would have terminated its relationship with Baranovskiy and his associates, the
other Cross-Defendants, much earlier. 
 
While
Cross-Defendants assert that under the Los Angeles Municipal Code § 1-5.06(a),
A&G cannot accept money for the cannabis in its own name and the monies
paid belong to IMA, the fact that the TACC alleges that Cross-Defendants
misrepresented the point of sale, is a sufficient allegation of a material
misrepresentation to sustain a claim for negligent and intentional
misrepresentation. 
 
Therefore,
the demurrer to the second and third cause of action is overruled. 
 
C.        Demurrer to Fourth Cause of Action –
Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
 
Cross-Defendants
assert that the fourth cause of action fails because the TACC does not allege a
breach of contract claim against them. “‘The prerequisite for any action for
breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is the existence
of a contractual relationship between the parties, since the covenant is an
implied term in the contract.’” (Molecular Analytical Systems v. Ciphergen
Biosystems, Inc. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 696, 711–712 citing Smith v.
City and County of San Francisco (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 38, 49.) 
 
In
their opposition, Cross-Complainants assert that they voluntarily withdraw the
fourth cause of action, hence making the demurrer to the fourth cause of action
moot. As the Cross-Complainant has not moved to dismiss the fourth cause of
action, the court sustains the demurrer to the fourth cause of action without
leave to amend. 
 
D.        Fifth, Sixth, Seventh Causes of Action -
Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations, and Negligent Interference
with Economic Relations 
 
“The
elements of a cause of action for intentional interference with contractual
relations are ‘(1) the existence of a valid contract between the plaintiff and
a third party; (2) the defendant’s knowledge of that contract; (3) the
defendant’s intentional acts designed to induce a breach or disruption of the
contractual relationship; (4)actual breach or disruption of the contractual
relationship; and (5) resulting damage.’ ” (Redfearn v. Trader Joe's Co.
(2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 989, 997, citing Reeves v. Hanlon (2004) 33
Cal.4th 1140, 1148.)¿ 
 
To state a claim for the
tort of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage (IIPEA),
the claimant must allege: (1) an economic relationship between the claimant and
some third party, with the probability of future economic benefit to the
claimant; (2) the defendant or cross-defendant’s knowledge of the relationship;
(3) intentional acts on the part of the defendant or cross-defendant designed
to disrupt the relationship; (4) actual disruption of the relationship; and (5)
economic harm to the claimant proximately caused by the acts of the
defendant.¿(Marsh v. Anesthesia Services Medical Group, Inc. (2011) 200
Cal.App.4th 480, 504.) 
 
The
tort of negligent interference with a prospective economic advantage (“NIPEA”)
differs in that the defendant's act disrupting the economic relationship does
not need to be intentional. (Venhaus v. Shultz (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th
1072, 1078.)“The tort of negligent interference with economic
relationship arises only when the defendant owes the plaintiff a duty of care.”
(Stolz v. Wong Communications Limited Partnership (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th
1811, 1825 [italics original].) 
 
“[T]he
same wrongful act may constitute both a breach of contract and an invasion of
an interest protected by the law of torts.”¿ (North American Chemical Co. v.
Superior Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 764, 774.) However, “conduct amounting
to a breach of contract becomes tortious only when it also violates a
duty independent of the contract arising from principles of tort law.”¿ (Erlich
v. Menezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th 543, 551 [italics added]; see also Applied
Equipment Corp. v. Litton Saudi Arabia Ltd. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 503, 515 [‘
“An omission to perform a contract obligation is never a tort, unless that
omission is also an omission of a legal duty.” ’ [internal quotation marks and
citations omitted].)
 
The
fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action similarly allege that IMA and
A&G entered into an Agreement or had an economic relationship wherein
A&G would be the exclusive manager and operator of the cannabis business.
(TACC, ¶¶ 110, 120, 121, 132, 133.) “Baranovskiy, Nixpro, Khlevnoy, Quick,
Tran, and Bohun knew of the Agreement between IMA and A&G as they were
hired to operate the Business on A&G's behalf.” (Id., ¶ 112, 122,
134.) The TACC alleges that “IMA received proceeds from Baranovskiy through the
embezzlement and benefitted from Baranovskiy’s schemes” and “Cross-Defendants
named herein ultimately acted together to deceive, defraud, and conspire
against Cross-Complainants by converting the Business's funds for their own
gains and to fraudulently induce the termination of the Agreement.” (Id.,
¶¶ 113, 114, 125, 136, 137.) “IMA terminated the Agreement with A&G free to
[be free] form a business relationship with Baranovskiy, Nixpro, Khlevnoy,
Quick, Tran, and Bohun.” (Id., ¶¶ 116, 127, 139.) 


Cross-Defendants
assert that the fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action fail because
Cross-Complainants fail to allege facts to support the allegation that
Cross-Defendants’ conduct was a substantial factor in causing IMA to terminate
the Agreement. “[A]n actor's conduct ‘is not a substantial factor in bringing
about harm to another if the harm would have been sustained’ in the absence of
the actor's conduct.” (Jenni Rivera Enterprises, LLC v. Latin World
Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th 766, 792.) The TACC
alleges that IMA terminated the contract “due to nonpayment of Taxes and the
Reduced monthly fee” not because A&G discovered the Cross-Defendants’
embezzlement scheme and cut off IMA’s benefit from the scheme. (TACC, ¶ 34.)
Accordingly, the court finds that the TACC fails to allege facts to show that
Cross-Defendants’ conduct caused a disruption in IMA and A&G’s contractual
relationship. The fact that Cross-Defendants benefitted from IMA’s termination
of the contract is insufficient to show that Cross-Defendants’ conduct caused
IMA to terminate the business relationship. 
 
Moreover,
both interference with contract and interference with prospective
economic relations are “Torts [that] enable a party to a contract to sue a
stranger to that contract for interfering with the contract and both require an
intentional act.” (PMC, Inc. v. Saban Entertainment, Inc. (1996) 45
Cal.App.4th 579, 595 disapproved on other grounds by Korea Supply Co. v.
Lockheed Martin Corp. (2003) 29 Cal.4th 1134.)
“The tort of intentional interference with contractual relations is committed
only by “strangers—interlopers who have no legitimate interest in the scope or
course of the contract's performance.” (Applied Equipment Corp. v. Litton
Saudi Arabia Ltd. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 503, 514.) Here, the TACC repeatedly
alleges that Cross-Defendants are agents of IMA. (TACC, ¶¶ 13, 39, 64, 66, 85,
87.) If Baranovsky, Nixpro, Khlevnoy, Quick,
Tran, and Bohan were agents of IMA, then they are not strangers to the contract
between IMA and A&G and cannot be held liable for assisting IMA in
breaching its own contract. 
 
Cross-Complainants’
opposition asserts that there is also a second contractual relationship between
A&G and Baranovskiy. (TACC, ¶¶ 16-18, 19-21.) While the TACC does allege a
business relationship between A&G and Baranovskiy, the fifth, sixth, and
seventh causes of action are devoid of the factual elements necessary to
support claims for tortious interferences by the other Cross-Defendants.
 
Therefore,
the demurrer to the fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action is sustained
without leave to amend. 
 
Motions to Strike
 
A.        Nixpro
Cross-Defendants’ Motion to Strike:
 
The Nixpro Cross-Defendants
seek to strike the following from the TACC: 
 
·      
All
allegations relying on claims of conversion, conspiracy, and embezzlement
throughout the TACC, specifically at ¶¶ 25, 28, 36, 39-40, 58, 61, 64, 79, 82,
85, 96, 100-101, 113, 114-116, 124, 125-128, 136, 137-139, and 144, on the
grounds that the Court has sustained Demurrers to causes of action for
Conversion, Violation of Penal Code § 496(c) and Conspiracy without leave to
amend; 
 
·      
TACC,
¶ 70 at pp. 15:6; ¶ 91 at p. 18:26, and ¶ 106 at p. 21:9: “Cross-Complainant
reasonably relied on Cross-Defendants’ representations.”
 
·      
TACC
¶ 108 at p. 21:13-17: “The conduct described in the preceding paragraphs was
willful, intentional, and fraudulent, as those terms are defined in Civil Code
§ 3294. Accordingly, Cross-Complainants are entitled to punitive and exemplary
damages against Cross-Defendants in such amounts as shall be necessary and
appropriate to punish Cross-Defendants for their acts, practices,
misrepresentations, and concealment, and to deter them, and anyone else, from
ever attempting to commit similar acts.”
 
The court denies the request
to strike claims relying on claims of conversion, conspiracy, and embezzlement
because they are used to support Cross-Complainants’ claims of negligent and
intentional misrepresentation. Matter which is essential to a
cause of action should not be stricken and it is error to do so. (Clements
v. T.R. Bechtel Co. (1954) 43 Cal.2d. 227, 242.) 
Where a motion to strike is so broad as to include relevant
matters, the motion should be denied as the proper pleading challenge by an
opponent in such a case is a special demurrer to the cause of action. (Triodyne,
Inc. v. Superior Court (1966) 240 Cal.App.2d 536, 542.) 
Moreover, as the demurrer to the second and third causes of
action has been overruled, the court similarly denies the request to strike the
allegation that the Cross-Complainants relied on the Cross-Defendants’
representations. 
To state a claim for punitive damages under Civ. Code §
3294, a plaintiff must allege specific facts showing that the defendant has
been guilty of malice, oppression or fraud. (Smith v. Superior Court
(1992) 10 Cal. App. 4th 1033, 1042.)  The basis for punitive damages must
be pled with specificity; conclusory allegations devoid of any factual
assertions are insufficient. (Ibid.)  
“Malice” is defined in Civ. Code § 3294 (c)(1) as “conduct
which is intended by the defendant to cause injury” or “despicable conduct
which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of
the rights or safety of others.” “Oppression” is as “despicable conduct subjecting
a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s
rights.” (Civ. Code § 3294(c)(2).) The term “despicable” has been defined in
the case law as actions that are “base,” “vile,” or “contemptible.”  (Shade Foods, Inc. v. Innovative Products
Sales & Marketing, Inc. (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 847, 891.) Fraud means
“an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact
known to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of
thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing
injury.” (Civ. Code, § 3294(c) (3).)
The court denies the Nixpro
Cross-Defendants’ request to strike punitive damages from the TACC because the
TACC sufficiently alleges that individual Cross-Defendants Baranovsky, , Khlevnoy,
Quick, Tran, and Bohan engaged in fraudulent conduct to deprive
Cross-Complainant of their property. (TACC, ¶¶ 28, 39, 58, 61, 64, 79, 82.) 
Therefore, the motion to strike is denied.

The court finds that because the
demurrer to the second and third causes of action is overruled, any allegations
related to the alleged misrepresentation should not be stricken. Therefore, the
motion to strike the following is denied:
·      
Page 6, lines 1-3;
·      
Paragraph
58, Page 12, lines 20-24;
·      
Paragraph

As the demurrer to the fifth,
sixth, and seventh causes of action is sustained without leave to amend, any
allegations that Cross-Defendants fraudulently induced IMA to terminate its
business relationship with Cross-Complainants should be stricken. Therefore,
Cross-Defendants motion to strike is otherwise granted.
