Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Judge has denied Defendant's motion to enforce the settlement agreement and for attorneys' fees. The Judge has ordered that the Property be listed on the Multiple Listing Service for sale. The Judge has also denied Defendant's request for an additional 90 days to complete the loan assumption process and for Defendant to pay Plaintiff's half of the mortgage obligation during that time. The Judge has further denied Defendant's request for Plaintiff to pay her share of property expenses, including HOA dues, property tax, and home insurance. The Judge has concluded that the settlement agreement must be enforced as written and that the parties have not demonstrated any compelling reason to modify the terms of the agreement.
