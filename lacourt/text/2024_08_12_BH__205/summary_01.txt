And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a request for default judgment from the plaintiffs, Steven Fischer, Lindsay Hughes, and Dr. Ruth Jackson, against the defendants, The Mayme A. Clayton Library and Museum, Renei V. Clayton Jr., and Lloyd L. Clayton. The case involves a dispute between the non-profit organization, MCLM, and its board members, who allegedly continued to hold illegitimate board meetings and refused to set a meeting to elect new board members. The board members also allegedly siphoned funds for their personal use and attempted to put the collection at California State University at Dominguez Hills, which violated the bylaws and purposes of MCLM.

The judge notes that the plaintiffs have complied with the requirements for a default judgment, including submitting a declaration of attorneys' fees and costs. The judge also exercises its discretion to award more than the cap on attorneys' fees, as required by the bylaws of MCLM. The total amount of the default judgment is $126,688.21, which includes $121,920.50 in attorneys' fees and $4,767.71 in costs. The judge grants the request for default judgment and awards the default judgment in favor of the plaintiffs.
