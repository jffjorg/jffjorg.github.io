  CASE NO.: 23STCV03072
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT’S MOTIONS
  TO COMPEL DISCOVERY
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 12, 2023



 
On
June 21, 2023, Defendant Irene Chen, M.D. served Demand For Documents, Set One;
Form Interrogatories, Set One; and Special Interrogatories, Set One on Plaintiff
Merhnaz Hadian.  Defendant has not received
any responses.
On
November 6, 2023, Defendant filed three motions to compel responses.
Where
a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make
an order compelling responses.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)  A party that fails to serve timely responses waives
any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection
of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).)
Plaintiff
filed no opposition to these motions and failed to serve responses.  Accordingly, the motions to compel are GRANTED,
and Plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses, without objection, to Defendant’s
Demand For Documents, Set One; Form Interrogatories, Set One; and Special Interrogatories,
Set One within 30 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
