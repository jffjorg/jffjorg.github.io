Significant Statements:
  - "Alter ego is an extreme remedy, sparingly used." (Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 523)
  - "Difficulty in enforcing a judgment or collecting a debt is not enough to establish an inequitable result." (Sonora Diamond, supra, 83 Cal.App.4th at p. 539)
  - "No single factor governs; courts must consider all of the circumstances of the case in determining whether it would be equitable to impose alter ego liability." (Highland Springs Conference & Training Center v. City of Banning (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 267, 281)
  - "The Court finds that it is highly unlikely that Nina's Cafe, Inc. and Libasky Johanina Gutierrez-Tobar will have assets to satisfy the judgment, and it would be inequitable to preclude collection from an alter ego."
