And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The defendant had argued that the plaintiff signed an arbitration agreement on March 30, 2020, but the plaintiff claimed she did not sign it and would not have signed it if asked. The defendant provided a declaration from an employee who worked in Office Operations and assisted the Human Resources Department, stating that the plaintiff was provided with the arbitration agreement and that it was standard practice for all employees. However, the declarant did not witness the plaintiff signing the agreement and did not demonstrate personal knowledge of the plaintiff's act of signing it. Therefore, the defendant has not met its burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement. As a result, the motion to compel arbitration is denied.
