The Judge has granted the motion, citing that the new facts about increased damages are consistent with the original complaint and do not add any new legal theories or causes of action. The Plaintiffs are ordered to file their supplemental complaint within 10 days and serve it within 30 days of issuance of the supplemental summons.
