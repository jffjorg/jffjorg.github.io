  CASE NO.: 22STCV29121
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR LEAVE
  TO FILE SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 12, 2023



 
On September 1, 2023, Plaintiffs
Olivia Nervo and Miriam Nervo filed this unlawful detainer action against Defendants
Chris Neary and Tuere McCall.  Possession
is no longer at issue because Defendants vacated the property in December 2022.  (Kellener Decl. ¶ 4.)
On
November 7, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a supplemental complaint.  Defendants did not file an opposition.
A
plaintiff may move to file a supplemental complaint that alleges material facts
occurring after the prior complaint was filed. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 464, subd. (a).) 
Permission to file  supplemental complaint
is in the trial court’s discretion, “‘provided it is in furtherance of and consistent
with the original complaint and is not a new or independent cause of action.’”  (Lincoln Property Co., N.C., Inc. v. Travelers
Indemnity Co. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 905, 916.)
Plaintiffs
seek to supplement their complaint with additional amounts owed for rent and property
damage that accrued after the complaint was filed.  (See Kellener Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.)  These new facts about increased damages are consistent
with the original complaint and do not add any new legal theories or causes of action.
Accordingly,
the motion for leave to file a supplemental complaint is GRANTED.  Plaintiffs are ordered to file their supplemental
complaint within 10 days and ordered to serve the supplemental complaint within
30 days of issuance of the supplemental summons.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
