[TENTATIVE] ORDER CONTINUING HEARINGS 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 12, 2023



 
On September 28, 2023, Defendant
General Motors LLC filed a motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative, summary
adjudication.  On November 27, 2023, Plaintiffs
Richard C. Gallegos and Christina L. Gallegos filed a motion for leave to file a
first amended complaint.  Both motions are
set for December 12, 2023.
On
December 6, 2023, Defendant’s counsel filed a Notice of Former Association Between
Counsel and Assigned Judge.  The Court therefore
finds good cause to continue the hearings. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (a)(3).)
At
the December 12, 2023 hearings, the parties should be prepared to address the Notice
and discuss what action, if any, the Court should take in response to the Notice.
The
Hearing on Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the alternative, Summary Adjudication
and Hearing on Motion for Leave to File a First Amended Complaint are CONTINUED
to December 22, 2023 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 48 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 12th day of December 2023
