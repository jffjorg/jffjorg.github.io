[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR LEAVE
  TO AMEND COMPLAINT; SETTING ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 12, 2023



 
Pending
before the Court is a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.  The first amended complaint identifies the Plaintiff
as “Kevin Garlington for Serenity Inclusive Family Services LLC.”  The pending motion makes clear that this action
“is brought by plaintiff KEVIN GARLINGTON FOR SERENITY INCLUSIVE FAMILY SERVICES
LLC (‘Plaintiff’), whereas KEVIN GARLINGTON is a competent adult and SERENITY INCLUSIVE
FAMILY SERVICES LLC is a Limited Liability Company qualified to do business in California,”
and “[t]he Plaintiff in this complaint is not KEVIN GARLINGTON individually.”  (Motion at p. 2.)
“[A]
corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona
or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  According to the State Bar’s website, Kevin Garlington
is not a licensed attorney.
The
motion for leave to amend is DENIED.
An
Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to Retain Counsel for Serenity Inclusive Family
Services LLC is scheduled for 02/13/2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 48 at Stanley
Mosk Courthouse.  Serenity Inclusive Family
Services LLC must retain counsel by that date or the Court will dismiss this action.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
