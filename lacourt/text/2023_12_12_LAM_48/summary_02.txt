And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the plaintiff's motion to disqualify defendants' counsel. The motion was filed after the jury trial in this action, in which the jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants. The plaintiff argues that disqualification is necessary because Zalman Robles, a former associate of the plaintiff's counsel, joined defendants' counsel's firm in June 2023 and had direct communications with defendants' counsel during his time at the plaintiff's counsel's firm. However, the judge finds that defendants have rebutted the presumption that any confidential attorney-client information was used or disclosed in Robles's new employment with defendants' firm. The judge also finds that plaintiff has not shown that Robles actually conveyed confidential information. Additionally, the judge notes that defendants' firm created an ethical wall to prohibit Robles from accessing information related to the case, and that any wrongdoing or harm to plaintiff arising from responses to request for admission was caused by Robles's actions while at the plaintiff's counsel's firm, not by his later employment with defendants' counsel's firm.
