[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO AMEND
  JUDGMENT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 12, 2023



 
On
March 17, 2022, the Court granted a motion to enforce the settlement between Plaintiff
Rafael Rodriguez Maldonado and Defendants Nina’s Cafe, Inc. and Libasky Johanina
Gutierrez-Tobar.  On April 1, 2022, the Court
entered judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants, jointly and severally,
in the amount of $54,500.00 plus $1,685.00 in attorney fees and costs.
On
June 20, 2023, the Court denied Plaintiff’s motion to amend the judgment, finding
that Plaintiff had not proven that there would be an inequitable result if Nina’s
Cafe Bar, Inc. was not added as a judgment debtor.
On
November 14, 2023, Plaintiff filed a new motion to amend the judgment to add Nina’s
Cafe Bar, Inc. as a judgment debtor.  No oppositions
were filed.
DISCUSSION
Code
of Civil Procedure section 187 grants courts the authority to amend a judgment to
add an alter ego of an original judgment debtor, thereby making the additional judgment
debtor liable on the judgment.  (Highland
Springs Conference & Training Center v. City of Banning¿(2016) 244 Cal.App.4th
267, 280.)  Alter ego need not be alleged
or proven in the underlying lawsuit.  (Misik
v. D’Arco (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 1065, 1074-1075.)  To add an alter ego judgment debtor, the judgment
creditor must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, “(1) the parties to be added
as judgment debtors had control of the underlying litigation and were virtually
represented in that proceeding; (2) there is such a unity of interest and ownership
that the separate personalities of the entity and the owners no longer exist; and
(3) an inequitable result will follow if the acts are treated as those of the entity
alone.”  (Relentless Air Racing, LLC v.
Airborne Turbine Ltd. Partnership (2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 811, 815-816.)  “Alter ego is an extreme remedy, sparingly used.”  (Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court
(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 523, 539 (Sonora Diamond).)
A.        Nina’s Cafe Bar, Inc. Had Control of This
Litigation and Was Virtually Represented in These Proceedings.
The
Complaint alleged that Plaintiff was employed by Nina’s Cafe, Inc. at 2805 E. Gage
Avenue, Huntington Park, California 90255, and Libasky Johanina Gutierrez-Tobar
was the owner and operator of that business.
Plaintiff
provides a copy of Nina’s Cafe, Inc.’s January 5, 2022 Statement of Information,
obtained from the Secretary of State’s website, which lists a principal office address
of 2805 E. Gage Avenue, Huntington Park, California 90255 and a mailing address
of 1465 Sunkist Avenue, La Puente, California, 91764.  (Alavi Decl. ¶ 4 & Ex. B.)   Libasky Johanina Gutierrez-Tobar is the CEO,
Secretary, CFO, and sole Director.
Plaintiff
also provides a copy of Nina’s Cafe Bar, Inc.’s January 5, 2022 Statement of Information,
obtained from the Secretary of State’s website. 
(Alavi Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. C.)  The
principal office address is 6626 Atlantic Boulevard, Bell, California, 90201.  The mailing address is also 1465 Sunkist Avenue,
La Puente, California, 91764, and Libasky Johanina Gutierrez-Tobar is also the CEO,
Secretary, CFO, and sole Director.
The
Court finds by a preponderance of evidence that Nina’s Cafe Bar, Inc. had control
of the underlying litigation and was virtually represented in these proceedings
through Defendant Libasky Johanina Gutierrez-Tobar.
B.        Nina’s Cafe Bar, Inc. Shares Unity of
Interest and Ownership With Defendants.
Courts
consider many factors when determining whether there is a sufficient unity of interest
and ownership, including commingling of funds and assets, identical equitable ownership,
use of the same offices and employees, disregard of corporate formalities, identical
directors and officers, use of one entity as a mere shell or conduit for the affairs
of the other, and inadequate capitalization of the original judgment debtor.  (Highland Springs Conference & Training
Center v. City of Banning (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 267, 280-281.)  “No single factor governs; courts must consider
all of the circumstances of the case in determining whether it would be equitable
to impose alter ego liability.”  (Id.
at p. 281.)
Two
Fictitious Business Name Statements indicate that Nina’s Cafe Bar, Inc. is doing
business as “Nina’s Cafe” and “Nina’s Cafe Bar” at both 6626 Atlantic Boulevard
and 2805 E. Gage Avenue.  (Alavi Decl. ¶¶
6-7 & Exs. D-E.)  The 2805 E. Gage Avenue
address is where Plaintiff worked for Nina’s Cafe, Inc.  Libasky Johanina Gutierrez-Tobar is the CEO, Secretary,
CFO, and sole Director of both Nina’s Cafe, Inc. and Nina’s Cafe Bar, Inc.
Accordingly,
the Court finds by a preponderance of evidence that there is sufficient unity of
interest and ownership between Defendants and Nina’s Cafe Bar, Inc.
C.        Plaintiff Has Shown That There Will Be
an Inequitable Result.
Difficulty
in enforcing a judgment or collecting a debt is not enough to establish an inequitable
result.  (Sonora Diamond, supra, 83
Cal.App.4th at p. 539.)  However, when there
is a sole judgment debtor and it is highly unlikely the debtor will ever have assets
to satisfy the judgment, it may be inequitable to preclude collection when the debtor
and its alter ego are one and the same.  (Triyar
Hospitality Management, LLC v. WSI (II) - HWP, LLC (2020) 57 Cal.App.5th 636,
643 (Triyar).)
Libasky
Johanina Gutierrez-Tobar appeared in her capacity as a representative of Nina’s
Cafe, Inc. for a May 22, 2023 judgment debtor examination.  (Alavi Decl. ¶ 12.)  She testified that two of Nina’s Cafe, Inc.’s
three bank accounts are closed, and the open account contains only $40.00.  (Alavi Decl. ¶ 12.)  Nina’s Cafe, Inc. also has over $200,000.00 in
debt.  (Alavi Decl. ¶ 13.)
Gutierrez-Tobar
appeared in her individual capacity for an October 13, 2023 judgment debtor examination.  (Alavi Decl. ¶ 16 & Ex. I.)  She testified that she owns a single-family home
that is worth “$750,000 maybe.”  (Alavi Decl.,
Ex. I at p. 14.)  She owns “[l]ess than $10,000”
of jewelry and an investment account worth $1,100.  (Id. at pp. 17, 20.)  She distributes $5,000 to $6,000 to herself as
monthly income from Nina's Cafe Bar, Inc. 
(Id. at p. 37.)  She is current
on her $400 biweekly personal loan payments and $2,677 monthly mortgage payments.  (Id. at pp. 25-26, 49.)  Gutierrez-Tobar also owns three or four cars including
a 2021 Lexus LX570, 2020 Jeep Gladiator, and 2018 Mercedes E class, with financing
of $69,000, $34,000, and $50,000 outstanding. 
(Id. at pp. 15-16.)  She is
current on her monthly car payments of $998, $1,700, and $1,286.  (Id. at p. 25.)  The Mercedes “is going to be returned or what
is that term confiscated more than likely,” saving her almost $1,300 each month.  (Id. at p. 58.)
Despite
making the above payments, Gutierrez-Tobar’s tax returns show losses for each of
the last three years: $170,911.00 in 2019; $201,075.00 in 2020; and $184,190.00
in 2021.  (Alavi Decl., Ex. J.)
The
Court finds that it is highly unlikely that Nina’s Cafe, Inc. and Libasky Johanina
Gutierrez-Tobar will have assets to satisfy the judgment, and it would be inequitable
to preclude collection from an alter ego. 
(See Triyar, supra, 57 Cal.App.5th at p. 643.)
CONCLUSION
The
motion is GRANTED.  The April 1, 2022
judgment is ordered to be amended to name Nina’s Cafe Bar, Inc. as a judgment debtor,
jointly and severally.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
