And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the hearing on the motion for approval of the PAGA settlement will be continued. The parties are ordered to meet and confer regarding the language in a notice/letter to be sent to the Aggrieved Employees along with the settlement checks. Additionally, the Claims Administrator, Simpluris, Inc., must provide information regarding the procedures it has in place to protect employee data and insurance for any data breach.

The judge finds that the terms of the settlement are reasonable and that the settlement is in the best interests of the parties and the Aggrieved Employees. However, the judge also finds that certain language in the proposed "Notice of Settlement Representative Action" is unclear and may incorrectly cause the Aggrieved Employees to believe they have the right to opt-out of or object to the settlement.

The judge orders that the parties provide supplemental papers regarding the language in the notice/letter to be sent to the Aggrieved Employees along with the settlement checks and for Simpluris, Inc. to provide information regarding the procedures it has in place to protect employee data and insurance for any data breach.
