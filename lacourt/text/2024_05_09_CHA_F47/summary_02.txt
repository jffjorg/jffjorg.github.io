Here is a YAML summary of the tentative ruling:

```
Case Number: 23CHCV00693
Judge: [Judge's Name]
Plaintiff: Hezequias Kizito and Jennie Kizito
Defendant: Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (SPS) and U.S. Bank NA, successor trustee to Bank of America, NA, successor in interest to LaSalle Bank NA, as trustee
Date: May 9, 2024

**Facts**

* The case arises from a non-judicial foreclosure proceeding initiated by the defendants against the plaintiff's property.
* The plaintiff's property is located at 17225 Celtic Street, Granada Hills, CA 91344.
* The plaintiff's loan was originally from Washington Mutual Bank, N.A. in 2006.
* The loan was subsequently assigned to JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association in 2011 and to the Trust in 2017.
* The defendants recorded a notice of default (NOD) against the property in January 2022.

**Disputes**

* The plaintiff's alleged that the defendants violated the Homeowners Bill of Rights (HBOR) by recording the NOD without contacting the plaintiff to assess their financial situation and explore options to avoid foreclosure.
* The plaintiff's also alleged that the NOD contained an incorrect amount of the deficiency.
* The defendants argued that any violations of the HBOR were cured by subsequently reviewing the plaintiff's application for a loan modification and approving a trial modification plan.

**Ruling**

* The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.
* The court held that the plaintiff's claims under Civil Code 2923.5, Civil Code 2924.9, and Business & Professions Code 17200, et seq. fail because the plaintiff's were given an opportunity to be considered for foreclosure alternatives.
* The court also held that the plaintiff's claims for breach of contract failed because they did not allege specific facts describing what terms of the 2011 Loan Modification Agreement the defendants breached.

The court found that the plaintiff's claims under the Homeowners Bill of Rights, Civil Code 2924.9, and Business & Professions Code 17200, et seq. failed because the plaintiff's were given an opportunity to be considered for foreclosure alternatives. The court also found that the plaintiff's claims for breach of contract failed because they did not provide specific facts about which terms of the 2011 Loan Modification Agreement the defendants allegedly breached.
