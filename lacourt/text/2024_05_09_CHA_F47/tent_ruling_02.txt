SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of non-judicial foreclosure
proceedings initiated against Plaintiffs  Hezequias Kizito and Jennie Kizito’s
(“Plaintiffs”) property by Defendants Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (“SPS”)
and U.S. Bank NA, successor trustee to Bank of America, NA, successor in
interest to LaSalle Bank NA, as trustee, on behalf of the holders of the Wa Mu
Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-AR12 (the “Trust”)
(collectively, “Defendants”).
 
Plaintiffs reside at the real property located at 17225
Celtic Street, Granada Hills, CA 91344 (the “Property”).  (First Amended Complaint (FAC) ¶5).  On 8/28/06, Plaintiffs obtained a $520,000
loan (the “Loan”) from lender Washington Mutual Bank, N.A. (“WaMu”).  (FAC ¶11).  The Loan is secured by a Deed of Trust (the
“DOT”) encumbering the Property.  (Id.,
Ex.A).  
 
On 8/5/16, the beneficial interest in the Deed of Trust
was assigned from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a Corporation
Organized and Existing Under An Act of Congress (FDIC), whose address is 1601
Bryan Street, Dallas TX 75201, and acting in its receivership capacity as
receiver of Washington Mutual Bank to JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association
(the “First Assignment”). (FAC ¶ 13, Ex.C). 
On 1/25/17, the beneficial interest in the Deed of Trust was assigned
from JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, successor in interest by
purchase from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver of
Washington Mutual Bank F/K/A Washington Mutual Bank, FA to JPMorgan Chase Bank,
National Association (the “Second Assignment”). 
(FAC ¶14, Ex.D).  On 1/25/17, the
beneficial interest in the Deed of Trust was assigned from JPMorgan Chase Bank,
National Association to the Trust (the “Third Assignment”).  (FAC, Ex.E). 
The Trust is the current beneficial holder of the DOT.  (FAC ¶15, Ex.E).  
 
Plaintiffs allege they were offered a Temporary Payment
Plan (“2011 TPP”) and a loan modification in 2011.  (FAC ¶18). 
Plaintiffs allege that in 2011, they also entered into a Loan
Modification Agreement with Chase Home Finance, LLC (the “2011 Loan
Modification Agreement”).  (FAC ¶18,
Ex.B).  
 
On 1/19/22, Defendants recorded a Notice of Default
(“NOD”) against the Property.  (FAC ¶17, Ex.G).  According to the NOD, the amount past due on
the loan was $123,127.62 as of 1/17/22.  Id.  The NOD also contains a Declaration of
Compliance made pursuant to Civil Code 2923.55 stating that due diligence
efforts were satisfied under Civil Code 2923.5(e).  Id. 

 
After the NOD was recorded, Plaintiffs submitted an
application for a loan modification to SPS. 
(FAC ¶23, Ex.H).  SPS reviewed
Plaintiffs’ application, and approved Plaintiffs for a Trial Modification Plan
in January 2022 which Plaintiff accepted in March 2022.  (FAC ¶¶ 22-23, Ex.H).  The Trial Modification Plan consisted of
three fixed payments from March 2022 to May 2022 which included contributions
towards principal, interest, and the monthly escrow amount.  (FAC, Ex.H at p.5).  Following performance of the Trial
Modification Plan, a permanent Loan Modification Agreement would automatically
go into effect on 5/1/22.  (FAC, Ex.H).  While Plaintiffs allege that they accepted
the Trial Modification Plan, it is not clear from the allegations in the First
Amended Complaint whether Plaintiffs performed under the terms of the Trial
Modification Plan.  (FAC, Ex.H at p.1).
 
Plaintiffs found the 2022 modification offered to them to
be unacceptable.  (FAC ¶22).  Therefore, they have sued Defendants claiming
they are unlawfully moving forward with foreclosure of the Property.   
 
On 6/24/22, Plaintiffs filed a prior action, LASC Case
No. 22CHCV00470, which was initially assigned to Department F49 in the
Chatsworth Courthouse and then transferred to Department 51.  The prior action concerned the same Property
and alleged causes of action against the same Defendants for: (1) Violation of Civil Code 2923.5, (2) Violation of Civil
Code 2924(a)(1), (3) Violation of Civil Code § 2924.9, (4) Unfair Business
Practices – Violations of Business & Professions Code 17200, et seq., (5) Cancellation
of Written Instruments – Civil Code 3412, and (6) Breach of Contract.  (RJN, Ex.1, 2).  After Defendants’ demurrer was sustained with
leave to amend, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint alleging causes of
action for: (1) Violation of Civil Code 2923.5, (2) Violation of Civil Code §
2924.9, (3) Unfair Business Practices – Violations of Business &
Professions Code 17200, et seq., (4) Cancellation of Written Instruments –
Civil Code 3412, and (5) Breach of Contract. 
(RJN, Ex.3).  With a Motion for Leave
to Amend pending, Plaintiffs dismissed their (First Amended) Complaint on
2/21/23 without prejudice.
 
On 3/10/23, Plaintiffs filed the instant action against
Defendants for: (1) Violation of Civil Code 2923.5; (2) Violation of Civil Code
2924(a)(1); (3) Violation of Civil Code 2924.9; (4) Unfair Business Practices –
Violation of Business & Professions Code 17200, et seq.; (5) Breach of
Contract and (6) Breach of Contract Two. 
On 6/6/23, Defendants filed and served a demurrer to the entire
complaint which Plaintiffs opposed.  On
9/20/23, this Court sustained the demurrer to the complaint with 20 days leave
to amend.  (RJN, Ex.4).  
 
On 10/11/23, Plaintiffs filed the subject First Amended
Complaint alleging causes of action for: (1) Violation of Civil Code 2923.5,
(2) Violation of Civil Code 2924.9, (3) Violation of Business and Professions
Code 17200, et seq., (4) Cancellation of Written Instruments – Civil Code 3412
and (5) Breach of Contract.  After meet
and confer efforts failed to resolve the issues Defendants have with the First
Amended Complaint, on 12/11/23, Defendants filed and served the instant
demurrer to the entire First Amended Complaint. 
Plaintiffs have opposed the demurrer and Defendants have filed a reply
to the opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendants’ Request for Judicial Notice (RJN) is granted.
 
1st Cause of Action – Violation of Civil
Code 2923.5
 
The purpose of the Homeowners Bill of Rights (“HOBR”) is
to ensure that homeowners “who may qualify for a foreclosure alternative are
considered for, and have a meaningful opportunity to obtain, available loss
mitigation options,” such as loan modifications or other alternatives to
foreclosure.  Penermon (N.D. Cal.
2014) 47 F.Supp.3d 982, 993; Civil Code 2923.4. 
However, a mortgage servicer will not be liable for a violation of the
HOBR that it has corrected and remedied before the recordation of the foreclosure
sale.  See Civil Code
2924.12(c).  It has been held that when
an otherwise valid NOD has been recorded in violation of the HOBR, the notice
is not void, and the violation may be cured without recording a new notice.  Billesbach (2021) 63 CA5th 830, 837,
846-847.
 
In the 1st cause of action Plaintiffs allege
that Defendants violated the HOBR by recording a
NOD without contacting Plaintiffs to assess their financial situation and
explore options to avoid foreclosure in violation of Civil Code
2923.5(a)(2).  (FAC ¶¶28, 32).  However, even if Defendants technically
violated the HOBR such violations were cured when SPS subsequently reviewed
Plaintiffs’ application for a loan modification, approved Plaintiffs for a
trial modification plan on 1/26/22 and a second modification of their loan in
May 2022, which were in addition to the modification offered to and accepted by
Plaintiffs in 2011.  (See FAC
¶¶18, 22-24, Ex.B, H).  The HOBR does not
guarantee any particular result (i.e., that Plaintiffs would be offered a loan
modification that they liked).  See
Civil Code 2923.4.  
 
Additionally, to be actionable, a violation of the HOBR
must have caused the Plaintiffs prejudice. 
Knapp (2004) 123 CA4th 76, 96; See also Herrera
(2012) 205 CA4th 1495, 1507.  Accepting
Plaintiffs’ allegations as true, the First Amended Complaint does not show
Plaintiffs were prejudiced by the alleged violation of the HOBR as they were
considered for a foreclosure alternative regardless of whether the amount in
the NOD was not accurate.  Civil Code
2924.12(c); (FAC ¶¶22-23).  The fact that
Plaintiffs had to choose between accepting a foreclosure alternative they did
not like or face foreclosure does not amount to prejudice due to the alleged
violation of Civil Code 2923.5.        
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs have still failed to
state a viable claim for violation of Civil Code 2923.5. 
 
2nd cause of action – Violation of Civil
Code 2924.9
 
Civil Code 2924.9 requires a loan servicer to send a
notice of potential foreclosure alternatives to borrower’s within 5 business
days after recording a Notice of Default. 
Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated Civil Code 2924.9 by failing
to “notify Plaintiffs of all foreclosure prevention alternatives within 5
business days after the Notice of Default [was] recorded.”  (FAC ¶41).  
However, as noted above, any violations of Civil Code 2924.9 were cured
when SPS thereafter reviewed and approved Plaintiffs for a loan modification.  See also Civil Code 2924.19(c).   
 
Plaintiffs also base this cause of action on the claim
that the amount of the deficiency stated on the NOD is incorrect.  (FAC ¶44). 
Plaintiffs claim that 2% fixed interest rate of the 2011 Loan
Modification Agreement should be applied to calculate the deficiency on the
NOD, rather than the step-rate interest rate from the 2011 TPP.  Id. 
However, Civil Code 2924.9 only concerns the exploration of foreclosure
avoidance options prior to recordation of a NOD.  As such, the  allegations regarding their step-rate interest
fail to support any cause of action for violation of section 2924.9.    
 
Additionally, the terms of the Temporary Loan
Modification Plaintiffs allege they accepted in 2022 supersede any modification
Plaintiffs had previously entered into. 
(FAC, Ex.H, p.7 ¶2.a.). 
Therefore, the correct interest rate to apply, based on Plaintiffs’
allegations would be the interest rate of the 2022 loan modification, which is
3.5%.  (FAC, Ex.H, pp. 6-7).  Plaintiffs acceptance of the 2022 loan
modification changing the applicable interest rate does not require
re-recording of the NOD.  An error in the
amount of the deficiency identified in the NOD does not invalidate the NOD.  A sale is not rendered void merely because of
minor or technical defects. See Knapp, supra at 95-99.  A sale is only rendered void when the defects
are substantial. Anderson (1989) 208 CA3d 202, 211-212; Little
(1987) 188 CA3d 1354, 1357–1359, 1362.  The default identified in the notice of
default must contain the ground of default and means for curing the default.   Civil Code 2924.  The NOD at issue includes this information.  (FAC, Ex.G).
 
Further, for a defect in the notice of default to be
material to a nonjudicial foreclosure, the defect must cause prejudice.  Civil Code 2924(a)(1).  Plaintiffs have not alleged how an error in
the calculation of the amount of deficiency caused them prejudice since they do
not allege they are not in default on the Loan.
 
Plaintiffs allege the 2011 TPP had a step-rate interest
from 2-5%.  (FAC ¶18).  Plaintiffs seem to be claiming that the 2011
Loan Modification Agreement had a 2% fixed interest rate.  (FAC ¶18). 
The 2011 Loan Modification Agreement attached as Exhibit B to
Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint only includes two of six pages, and is missing
pages related to the applicable interest rate.  (FAC, Ex.B). 
The pages of the 2011 Loan Modification Agreement which are attached
establish, among other things, the following terms: (a) a new principal balance
of $549,302.22; 
(b) a deferred principal amount of $30,800.00 due at
maturity, which is deducted from the principal balance when calculating
interest; (c) a remaining interest-bearing balance of $519,002.22 (principal
balance less the deferred principal amount) accruing interest at a step-rate of
2-5%; and (d) the deferred principal accrued interest at a different rate which
is delineated in the missing pages of Exhibit B.  (FAC, Ex.B §2C).  
 
Even without the missing pages, the information in
Exhibit B establishes that the 2011 Loan Modification Agreement applies a
step-rate interest to the bulk of the outstanding principal amount.  Id. 
Accepting Plaintiffs’ allegations as true, the only possibility of a
fixed rate interest would be on the deferred principal amount.  Id. 
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs have still not alleged
that Defendants violated Civil Code 2924.9. 

 
3rd cause of action – Unfair Business
Practices – Violation of Business & Professions Code 17200, et seq.
 
Plaintiffs concede that their cause of action for unfair
business practices is based on their claims for violation of the HBOR.  (See Opposition, p.7:8-9).  As noted above, those causes of action fail because
Plaintiffs were given an opportunity to be considered and were approved for a foreclosure
alternative.  (FAC ¶23, Ex.H).  Since the underlying claims fail so does the
unfair business practices claim.     
 
4th cause of action – Cancellation of
Written Instrument
 
Civil Code 3412 provides: 
 
“A written instrument, in respect
to which there is a reasonable apprehension that if left outstanding it may
cause serious injury to a person against whom it is void or voidable, may, upon
his application, be so adjudged, and ordered to be delivered up or canceled.”
 
To state a claim for cancellation of written instrument,
a plaintiff must allege facts showing that the instrument was procured by
fraud, accident or mistake.  Hironymous
(1921) 52 CA 727, 731 disapproved on other grounds in Robertson (2001)
90 CA4th 1319.
 
Here, Plaintiffs merely allege that they have a
reasonable belief that the Notice of Default “is voidable or void ab initio,”
and if left outstanding may cause serious injury to Plaintiffs because of
Defendants’ alleged violations of the HBOR. 
(See FAC ¶¶68-69).  
 
The opposition essentially concedes Plaintiffs failure to
allege sufficient facts to state the cancellation of instruments cause of
action by requesting leave to amend. 
However, Plaintiffs’ proposal to amend the claim “to allege damages in
the form of Defendant’s [sic] recording an inaccurate Notice of Default” does
not show that the Notice of Default was procured by fraud, accident or mistake
as required.  (See Opposition,
p.9:9-12).
 
As such, Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of
showing how the amendment will cure the defect in the pleading.  See Blank (1985) 39 C3d 311,
318; Rakestraw (2000) 81 CA4th 39, 44.
 
5th cause of action – Breach of Contract
 
The elements of a breach of contract cause of action are:
(1) the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance
under the contract, (3) defendant’s breach and (4) resulting damage to
plaintiff.  Richman (2014) 224
CA4th 1182, 1186.  
 
Here, Plaintiffs conclude that Defendants breached the
2011 Loan Modification Agreement “by not honoring and complying with the terms
within as successor interests [sic], and commencing with foreclosure on the
Subject Property.”  (FAC ¶¶72, 74).  Plaintiffs do not allege exactly which term
or terms of the 2011 Loan Modification Agreement Defendants failed to honor or
comply with and/or how Defendants did not honor or comply with such terms.  
 
Plaintiffs do not dispute the deficiencies of this cause
of action.  Rather, they request leave to
amend in order to allege specific facts describing what terms of the 2011 Loan
Modification Agreement Defendants breached without indicating what those facts
or terms are or how they were breached.   

  
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, the demurrer is sustained.  In ruling on the demurrer to the original
complaint in this action, the Court noted that Plaintiffs failed to address the
fact that although the pleading was only the original complaint in this action,
it was actually the third time Plaintiffs had attempted to assert their claims
against Defendants.  (9/20/23 Minute
Order, p.5; See also RJN, Ex.1-3). 
The Court further noted that due to the liberal policy of allowing leave
to amend, the Court would give Plaintiffs one more opportunity to try to cure
the defects in their claims against Defendants. 
(9/20/23 Minute Order, p.5). 
Plaintiffs have now had four opportunities to plead their claims against
Defendants and have failed to adequately do so. 
Additionally, Plaintiffs have failed to show how further amendment will
cure the defects in their pleading. 
Therefore, the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.
