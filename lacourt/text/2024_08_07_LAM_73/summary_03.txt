And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to continue the trial date and all related pre-trial deadlines. The new trial date is to be determined, but it will likely be set for October 2024. The judge found that the plaintiff has abandoned the case, failing to provide verified responses to the defendants' discovery requests and failing to appear at a hearing. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's counsel has withdrawn representation, citing a breakdown in client communication. The defendants' motion is based on California Rule of Court Rule 3.1332, which allows for a continuance of the trial date if a party shows good cause. The judge found that the defendants have shown good cause and that a six-month continuance will allow them to complete discovery and prepare for trial.
