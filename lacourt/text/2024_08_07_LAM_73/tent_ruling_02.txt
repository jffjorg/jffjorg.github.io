I. BACKGROUND
 
On February 4,
2022, Plaintiffs Ying Liu; Jian Qiang
Gu; Mooncali, LLC; CAXYH LLC; and Catena Partners LLC filed this action
against Defendants Peter Wang; J Baron, Inc.; Re/Max Premier Realty/Real
Estates Group; Leann Yan Li; and JL Capital Resources, Inc. 
 
On March 16,
2022, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint. Plaintiffs assert causes of
action for: 
1.      Breach of
Contract
2.      Fraud
3.      Conversion
4.      Breach of
Fiduciary Duty
5.      Quiet Title
6.      Business and
Professions Code section 17200
7.      Penal Code
section 496(a) & (c)
Plaintiffs allege that Defendants engaged in a fraudulent scheme
to steal significant amounts of money and real property from them. Plaintiff
Liu is the father of Plaintiff Gu. Liu and Gu hired Defendant Wang in July of
2021 to represent them in the purchase of real property located at 40825 Sierra
Maria, in Murrietta, California (Sierra Maria property). (Compl., ¶ 17.) On
August 15, 2021, Gu executed an agreement with the seller, Gary Broad (who is
not a party to the instant action), to purchase the Sierra Maria property for
$5.5 million. (Compl., ¶ 26.) Mooncali is an LLC owned by Liu and was to be the
named buyer. (Compl., ¶ 28.) Wang represented orally to Gu that there was an
unwritten understanding that the true purchase price was $6.1 million and that
$600k needed to pass to the seller “outside of escrow”. (Compl., ¶
24.)  
Defendant Li, whose relation to any other party in the action is
not described, represented to Liu and Gu that the $600,000 “outside escrow”
payment for the Sierra Maria property needed to be deposited with JL Capital,
an entity owned by Li. (Compl., ¶¶ 12, 31.) Liu and Gu obtained loans against
their equity in three other properties they owned to obtain the $600,000, which
they deposited with JL Capital. (Compl., ¶ 32.) Liu and Gu also deposited
$530,000 with Heritage Escrow Company to satisfy a written requirement in the
sales contract for a deposit. (Compl., ¶ 33.)  
On November 12, 2021, Wang told Gu that the sale of the Sierra
Maria property needed to close by the following Friday, or else Gu would lose
all of the money deposited, including the $530,000 deposit and the $600,000
outside-escrow payment. (Compl., ¶ 34.) The seller of the Sierra Maria property
cancelled the sales contract on November 23, 2021, and agreed to return the
initial deposit of $530,000, less escrow fees. (Compl., ¶ 36.) However, neither
Wang nor Li told Gu or Liu that they were entitled to receive their $530,000
back. (Compl., ¶¶ 36, 40.) Neither Gu or Liu ever received either their
$530,000 deposit or their outside-escrow $600,000 payment back. (Compl., ¶
41.)  
On October 9, 2021, Gu and Liu hired Wang to sell a property owned
by their company, Plaintiff CAMG, in order to fund the purchase of the Sierra
Maria property. (Compl., ¶ 29.) This property is located at 22032 La Puente
Road, in Walnut, California (Walnut property). (Id.) Plaintiffs allege
that Wang never listed the property but represented that Miracle, an alleged
alter ego of Wang, wanted to buy the Walnut property. Gu and Liu sold the
Walnut property to Miracle on October 25, 2021, for $970,000. (Compl., ¶ 30.)
Wang has since occupied the Walnut property as his primary residence. (Id.)  
On November 26, 2021, Wang and Defendant Meng forged Liu’s
signature on a quitclaim deed that transferred a property previously owned by
Liu to a company owned by Wang, which is an entity named as a Defendant in the
action and is called Wharton. (Compl., ¶ 37.) That property is located at 1415
Valinda Avenue, in La Puente, California (Valinda property). Defendant Meng was
the notary for the deed and claimed that Liu personally appeared to execute the
deed, but Liu was in China at the time. (Id.) The deed was recorded on
December 1, 2021. 
In November 2022, the Court granted Defendant Wang’s motion to
compel arbitration as to all claims except the fraud and conversion claims
asserted against Defendant Tuo Meng.
On July 12, 2024, Defendant Wang filed the
instant Motion for Order Adopting Arbitrator’s Recommendation, arguing:
·      
Defendant Wang moves for an order from the Court adopting the May
8, 2024 Recommendation issued by the Hon. Susan Cole, arbitrator for this
matter.
o   On May 8, 2024, Judge Cole issued her Recommendation, denying Mr.
Barela’s motion to participate in the arbitration and ordering Claimants to
either retain new counsel or dismiss their claims in the arbitration.
o   On July 2, 2024, Judge Cole held a teleconference in the arbitration. During
this teleconference, Judge Cole advised counsel for Mr. Wang that she intended
to schedule another teleconference on July 25, 2024, and that she would like to
conduct this teleconference with a ruling from the Court on the Recommendation.

·      
This Motion is made pursuant to the
Court’s inherent power and responsibility to fairly and efficiently administer
the judicial proceedings that are pending before it. (See Cal. Civ. Proc. Code
§ 128(a)(3), (5); Hays v. Sup. Ct., 16 Cal. 2d 260, 264 (1940).)
Plaintiffs did not file an opposition.
Defendant Wang filed a reply asserting
that Plaintiffs have consented to the Court’s adoption of the arbitrator’s
recommendation by failing to file an opposition. 
II. DISCUSSION
 
Defendant
Wang moves for an order from this Court adopting the May 8, 2024 Recommendation
issued by the Hon. Susan Cole, arbitrator for this matter. 
 
However, Defendant Wang’s motion and his reply to
the motion do not include proofs of service. Defendant Wang’s motion includes a
Court Reservation receipt for the hearing on this matter, but there is no
indication that the motion was served upon Plaintiffs. 
 
Failure to give notice of a motion is not only a violation of
the statutory requirements but of due process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones
v. Otero (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754, 757.)  
 
Accordingly,
the Defendant Wang’s Motion for Order
Adopting Arbitrator’s Recommendation is Denied without prejudice.
 
 
III. DISPOSITION
 
Defendant
Wang’s Motion for Order Adopting
Arbitrator’s Recommendation is Denied without prejudice.
