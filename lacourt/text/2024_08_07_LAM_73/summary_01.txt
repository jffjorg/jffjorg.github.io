Here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling grants the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel to Defendant David Romero, Trustee of the Laguna Seca Living Trust. The motion was filed by counsel for the defendants, Paul Carter, on July 3, 2024. The court finds that all the requirements for relief have been completed, and the attorney-client relationship has broken down due to a series of actions by the client that create an unwaiveable conflict between the client and counsel. The court grants the motion, as the withdrawal will not prejudice the client and will not disrupt the orderly process of justice.
