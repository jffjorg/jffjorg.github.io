And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling denies Defendant Wang's motion for an order adopting the arbitrator's recommendation without prejudice. The motion was filed on July 12, 2024, and the arbitrator's recommendation was issued on May 8, 2024. However, the motion does not include proofs of service, which is a violation of the statutory requirements and due process. The judge notes that the motion and reply do not indicate that the motion was served upon the plaintiffs. Therefore, the motion is denied without prejudice, meaning that the parties may re-file the motion if they wish.
