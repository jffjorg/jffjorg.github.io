 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Law Offices of JT Fox, APC’s Motion to be Relieved as
  Counsel [Res ID # 0933].



 
I. Background
On April 16, 2024, the Law Offices
of JT Fox, APC, counsel for Defendant Brentanita, Inc. (Brentanita), filed a motion
to be relieved as counsel for Brentanita.
JT Fox, APC’s motion is unopposed
and now before the Court.
 
II. Motion
A. Legal Standard
“The question of granting or
denying an application of an attorney to withdraw as counsel ([without client
consent pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section] 284, subd. (2)) is one
which lies within the sound discretion of the trial court ‘having in mind
whether such withdrawal might work an injustice in the handling of the case.’”
(People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406 [internal quotations
omitted].)
For an attorney to be relieved as
counsel, the attorney must comply with the requirements of California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362, subdivisions (a) and (c) to (e). These subdivisions require
that an attorney file and show proof of service of (1) a notice and motion to
be relived as counsel on Judicial Council form MC-051, (2) a declaration in
support of the motion to be relived as counsel on Judicial Council form MC-052,
and (3) a proposed order in support of the motion to be relieved as counsel on
Judicial Council form MC-053.
The court should consider whether
the attorney’s “withdrawal can be accomplished without undue prejudice to the
client’s interests.” (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904,
915.) Moreover, the motion should also be denied if it will cause undue delay
in the proceeding or cause injustice. (Mandell v. Superior Court (1977)
67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.)
B. Analysis
The Court GRANTS Law
Offices of JT Fox, APC’s motion.
First, Brentanita’s counsel, Law
Offices of JT Fox, APC, has complied with California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362. Within 16 court days of this hearing, plus additional days to
respond based on manner of service, Law Offices of JT Fox, APC
filed Judicial Council forms MC-051 to MC-053 with the Court and served
the same on Plaintiff Nazmifar and Defendant Toubian through counsel and
directly on Defendant Brentanita. A review of the three Judicial Council forms
for each Plaintiff shows that the forms are complete and properly filled out.
Second, there is a facially valid
reason for withdrawal—“[b]reakdown of attorney-client relationship.” (See Form
MC-052, § 2.)
 
Third, Plaintiff Nazmifar and
Defendants Toubian and Brentanita have not filed oppositions to this motion, and
there is no showing of prejudice or delay sufficient to deny Law
Offices of JT Fox, APC’s motion.
 
III. Conclusion
Law Offices of JT Fox, APC’s Motion
to be Relieved as Counsel [Res ID # 0933] is GRANTED.
