Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the motion to bifurcate the liability and damages phases of trial filed by The Claypool Law Firm and Brian E. Claypool. The Court finds that the motion has failed to show how bifurcation would promote judicial economy or prevent the liability determination from being tainted or otherwise influenced by damages evidence. The Court notes that the arguments made by the parties also raise the need for clarity regarding the claims to be tried at the trial, and orders the parties to meet and confer as to the issue of consolidation of the case for trial. The Court suggests that some other form of bifurcation or sequencing of the evidence may be appropriate.
