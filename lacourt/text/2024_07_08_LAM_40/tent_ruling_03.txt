 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
SL Retail Owner,
  LLC’s Demurrer to Complaint [Res ID # 4348].



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings and Consolidation
1. Lead Case
In LASC No. 22STCV09953, Plaintiff SL Retail Owner LLC (SL Retail)
sues Christopher Au and Does 1 through 20 pursuant to a May 26, 2022, First
Amended Complaint (FAC) alleging two breach of guaranty claims.
The FAC’s claims arise from allegations that Keisuke SC LLC (Keisuke SC)
leased commercial mall space from SL Retail and that Keisuke SC defaulted on
its two lease agreements—the Keisuke Lease and the Ushi Ushi Lease—with
Defendant Au, Keisuke SC’s guarantor, subsequently failing to compensate SL
Retail following Keisuke SC’s default.
On May 26, 2022—the same day on which the FAC was filed by SL Retail—SL
Retail filed a request for dismissal without prejudice in relation to Keisuke SC,
which the Clerk entered on May 31, 2022.
2. Later Filed
Case
In LASC No. 24STCV00971, Keisuke SC
and Ushi Ushi LLC (Ushi Ushi) sue SL Retail and Does 1-10 pursuant to a January
12, 2024, Complaint alleging claims of (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Breach of
Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, and (3) Declaratory Relief.
The claims arise from the following
allegations. After SL Retail found more desirable tenants to occupy the
restaurant spaces rented by Keisuke SC and Ushi Ushi, SL Retail deliberately
acted to prevent Keisuke SC and Ushi Ushi from fulfilling their contractual
obligations and from operating their businesses. For example, SL Retail failed
to provide the requisite paperwork for Keisuke SC and Ushi Ushi to secure the
necessary permits to establish their businesses, and as a result, hindered
Keisuke SC’s and Ushi Ushi’s ability to launch or open their businesses. SL
Retail also prematurely charge rent from Keisuke SC and Ushi Ushi at a time
when Keisuke SC and Ushi Ushi had not yet opened for business.
3. Relation and
Consolidation
On March 1, 2024, the Court related
the two actions.
On May 15, 2024, the Court
consolidated the two actions.
B. Motion Before the Court
On March 20, 2024, prior to
consolidation, SL Retail filed a demurrer in the Later Filed Case, which
challenges the 24STCV00971 Complaint’s first to third causes of action.
On June 24, 2024, after
consolidation, Keisuke SC and Ushi Ushi filed an opposition in the Lead Case.
On June 28, 2024, SL Retail filed a
reply in the Later Filed Case.
SL Retail’s demurrer is now before
the Court.
 
II. Demurrer
A. Request for Judicial Notice
Per SL Retail’s request, the Court
takes judicial notice of various judgments and/or orders (including a nunc pro
tunc) made in cases before the Los Angeles Superior Court. (Demurrer, Amended
RJN, p. 2, Exs. A-C; Evid. Code, §§ 452, subd. (d), 453, subds. (a)-(b).)
B. Legal Standard
A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).)
To sufficiently allege a cause of
action, a complaint must allege all the ultimate facts—that is, the facts
needed to establish each element of the cause of action pleaded. (Committee
on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197,
212, superseded by statute as stated in Branick v. Downey Savings & Loan
Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) “[E]ach evidentiary fact that might
eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v.
William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.)
In testing the sufficiency of the
cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly
pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962,
966-67.) Courts read the allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v.
City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216,
1228, disapproved on other grounds, Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines
Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) A demurrer, however, “does not
admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v.
Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) 
C. Demurrer, Complaint, First to
Third Cause of Action [Breach of Contract, Breach of Implied Covenant of Good
Faith and Fair Dealing, and Declaratory Relief]: SUSTAINED without leave
to amend.
a. Relevant
Law
The doctrine of res judicata has
two aspects: claim preclusion and issue preclusion. (DKN Holdings LLC v.
Faerber (2015) 61 Cal.4th 813, 824; Boeken v. Philip Morris USA, Inc.
(2010) 48 Cal.4th 788, 797.) Claim preclusion arises if a second suit involves
(1) the same cause of action (2) between the same parties [or those in privity
with them] (3) after a final judgment on the merits in the first suit.
[Citations.] If claim preclusion is established, it operates to bar
relitigation of the claim altogether.” (DNK Holdings LLC v. Faerber
(2015) 61 Cal.4th 813, 824.) “Upon satisfaction of these conditions, claim
preclusion bars ‘not only issues that were actually litigated but also issues
that could have been litigated.’” (Planning and Conservation League v.
Castaic Lake Water Agency (2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 210, 226, quoting Federation
of Hillside & Canyon Associations v. City of Los Angeles (2004) 126
Cal.App.4th 1180, 1202; Villacres v. ABM Industries Inc. (2010) 189
Cal.App.4th 562, 576.) 
A general demurrer lies where
preclusion applies. (See Boeken v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., supra,
48 Cal.4th at p. 792 [plaintiff’s wrongful death action barred by her prior
voluntary dismissal of loss of consortium action against same defendant]; Shine
v. Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (2018) 23 Cal.App.5th 1070, 1076-77 [court
properly took judicial notice of “pleading, settlement agreement, and
stipulated judgment of dismissal” in earlier class action to sustain demurrer
on res judicata grounds in new class action].)
b. Court’s
Determination
The Court finds in favor of SL
Retail.
Unlawful detainer is a summary
proceeding in which only limited issues may be presented to the court in a
limited time period. As a result, the judgment in an unlawful detainer action
is accorded only limited res judicata effect. (Vargas v. Municipal Court
(1978) 22 Cal.3d 902, 916 [“adjudications in unlawful detainer actions should
in general be afforded rather limited res judicata effect because of the
special nature of such proceedings”], following Vella v. Hudgins (1977)
20 Cal.3d 251, 255 (Vella).)
If an issue is actually litigated
in the unlawful detainer action, then the judgment will be res judicata as to
that issue. (Vella, supra, 20 Cal.3d at pp. 256-257.) In such a
case, the policy underlying res judicata is fully satisfied because the parties
have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue once and should not
be permitted to relitigate it in a subsequent proceeding. (Wood v. Herson
(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 737, 743-746.) The parties to an unlawful detainer action
may agree to a settlement that will have res judicata or collateral estoppel
effect, but the settlement documents must be comprehensive. (Landeros v.
Pankey (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1167, 1172-1174 (Landeros).)
Here, SL Retail argues that “the
issues raised by the [Keisuke SC and Ushi Ushi] Complaint are the same as the
issues in the Eviction Actions [by SL Retail against Keisuke SC and Ushi Ushi]
– i.e., whether Former Tenants and Landlord complied with the contractual
duties, and the respective rights that follow.” In support, SL Retail cites to
its amended request for judicial notice, which contains copies of the judgments
in the unlawful detainer actions against Keisuke SC and Ushi Ushi, as well as a
minute order for a denied ex parte application by Ushi Ushi to set aside the
judgment in the unlawful detainer proceeding against it. (Mot., p. 7; Mot.,
Amended RJN, p. 2, Exs. A-C.)
The Court agrees with SL Retail.
The underlying unlawful detainer
judgments were secured in the form of default judgments in favor of SL Retail
as against Keisuke SC and Ushi Ushi. (Mot., Amended RJN, Exs. A [Ushi Ushi
judgment], B [Keisuke SC judgment].) Thus, the record clearly shows that the
second and third requirements of claim preclusion—same parties, judgment in
underlying action—are applicable here. Though the opposition argues that the
judgments attached to the moving papers are of limited effect and do not
elaborate on the grounds for judgment (Opp’n, pp. 5-6, 10), the evidence is
clearly relevant to showing judgments have been entered by the Superior Court
against Keisuke SC and Ushi Ushi in unlawful detainer proceedings for the
subject premises. Moreover, the Court determines that primary rights that
should have been raised in the unlawful detainer proceedings involve the same
causes of action raised in the 24STCV00971 Complaint, as follows.
The remaining question is whether
the 24STCV00971
Keisuke SC and Ushi Ushi Complaint involves primary rights that could
have been raised as affirmative defenses to SL Retail’s right of possession to
the subject premises in the unlawful detainer proceedings, i.e., the same cause
of action.
In the unlawful detainer context, California
decisions have permitted the introduction of ‘equitable’ and ‘legal’ defenses
whenever such defenses, if proven, would have preserved possession in the
tenant. (Green v. Superior Court (1974) 10 Cal.3d 616, 634, fn. 19 (Green)
[collecting and summarizing cases].) Such defenses include discrimination in
housing and retaliatory eviction. (See, e.g., Abstract Investment Co. v.
Hutchinson (1962) 204 Cal.App.2d 242, 255 (Abstract Investment) [court
permitted tenant to raise landlord’s alleged racially discriminatory motive as
defense in unlawful detainer action where, if such discrimination were
established, constitutional principles would bar the state from giving
affirmative aid to the landlord’s eviction efforts]; Schweiger v. Superior
Court (1970) 3 Cal.3d 507, 513-517 (Schweiger) [upholding tenant’s
defense to an unlawful detainer action on the ground that landlord’s attempt to
evict tenant was in retaliation for exercise of right to ‘repair and deduct’
granted by Civil Code sections 1941 et seq.].)
Here, the 24STCV00971 Keisuke SC and
Ushi Ushi Complaint alleges that SL Retail deliberately acted to prevent
Keisuke SC and Ushi Ushi from fulfilling their contractual obligations and from
operating their businesses, such as by failing to provide the requisite
paperwork for Keisuke SC and Ushi Ushi to secure the necessary permits to
establish their businesses, thus hindering Keisuke SC’s and Ushi Ushi’s ability
to launch or open their businesses. The Complaint also alleges the premature
charging of rent at a time when Keisuke SC and Ushi Ushi had not yet opened for
business. (24STCV00971 Complaint, ¶¶ 4, 31 [paperwork], 49-50, 66-67 [premature
rent in violation of contracts].)
These allegations fall squarely
into defenses that could have been raised in the underlying unlawful detainer
proceedings as defenses favoring Keisuke SC or Ushi Ushi. If Keisuke SC or Ushi
Ushi had shown to the unlawful detainer courts that it was SL Retail, not them,
who had breached the parties’ lease agreements, then Keisuke SC or Ushi Ushi
would have been able to argue their right to remain in possession of the premises.
Consequently, the doctrine of res judicata applies based on the same causes of
action/primary right being at issue in the unlawful detainer actions (defenses)
and in the 24STCV00971 action (affirmative claims).
The Court rejects the opposition
arguments on pages 7 to 8 and 9 to the effect that the only primary right at
issue was right to possession over the subject premises. These arguments do not
sufficiently address the circumstances discussed in cases such as Green,
Abstract Investment, and Schweiger. Moreover, Duncan v. Kihagi
(2023) 96 Cal.App.5th 703 does not demand a contrary result as it rests on
very different facts. In that case, the tenants first filed their complaint for
nuisance, breach of contract and harassment in violation of a rent
stabilization ordinance. The following month, unlawful detainer actions were
filed by the landlords. The tenants thereafter filed an answer in the unlawful detainer
actions asserting affirmative defenses and a subsequent notice of surrender of
possession, stating that the matter therefore became an “ordinary civil action.”
(Id. at pp. 706-707.) Therefore, the case there turned on the fact that
the tenants had surrendered the premises before the unlawful detainer
proceeding, and thus both landlord and tenant may seek affirmative relief that would
not otherwise have been available in an unlawful detainer action, under Civil Code
§ 1952.3. The court of appeal there held that a tenant need not seek such
affirmative relief in the unlawful detainer, but could obtain such relief
subsequently in another action. (Id. at pp. 708-709.) Indeed, the court
in Duncan specifically distinguished its facts from those existing in
the most common application of the primary right theory: “[where] the first
suit has terminated in a judgment on the merits adverse to the plaintiff, the
defendant in the second suit may set up that judgment as a bar under the
principles of res judicata. . . . numerous cases hold that when there is only
one primary right an adverse judgment in the first suit is a bar even though
the second suit is based on a different theory or seeks a different remedy. [Citations
omitted.] Neither scenario occurred here.” (Id. at p. 709, italics
added.) By contrast, that is precisely the scenario occurring here. 
The other cases cited by Keisuke
are also inapposite. (Struiksma v. Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC (2021) 66
Cal.App.5th 546, 557 [plaintiffs not obligated to have raise in the UD action
their complex Truth in Lending Act (TILA) claims of the defendants’ failure to
apply payments to their account, resulting in foreclosure]; Vella, supra, 20
Cal.3d at p. 255 [unlawful detainer will not prevent one who is dispossessed
from bringing a subsequent action to resolve issues of title].)
The Court also rejects the
opposition argument that “Tenants’ Complaint presents retaliatory claims
strictly related to the underlying breaches of the lease agreements, which have
not been conclusively litigated and decided.” (Opp’n, p. 10.) The Court relies
on Schweiger, supra, to note that Keisuke LLC and Ushi
Ushi could have raised retaliation defenses in the unlawful detainer
proceedings.
Next, the Court rejects the
argument that because “Tenants relinquished their possession,” they “preserved
their right to seek affirmative relief on their separate contract and
commercial claims.” (Opp’n, p. 7.) Such arguments should have been raised in
the underlying unlawful detainer proceedings because they could have served as
defenses against the loss of possession. Even if Keisuke SC and Ushi Ushi considered
it better to relinquish the premises and instead sue for damages, obviating the
immediate need to defend in the unlawful detainer proceedings, the proper
course of action may have instead been to enter a stipulated judgment reserving
the rights raised in the 24STCV00971 Complaint. (See, e.g., Landeros,
supra, 39 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1172-1174.) Instead, Keisuke SC and Ushi
Ushi defaulted, with the Superior Court denying a motion by Ushi Ushi to set
aside the unlawful detainer judgment against it. (Mot., Amended RJN, Exs. A-B
[judgments], C [minutes denying motion to set aside].)
The Court notes that it is
immaterial that judgment in the unlawful detainer proceedings was entered in
the form of default judgment. (Martin v. Gen. Fin. Co. (1966) 239
Cal.App.2d 438, 443 [“A judgment by default is as conclusive as to the issues
tendered by the complaint as if it had been rendered after answer filed and
trial had on allegations denied by the answer”]; Murray v. Alaska Airlines,
Inc. (2010) 50 Cal.4th 860, 871 [“[A] judgment of default in a civil
proceeding is res judicata as to all issues aptly pleaded in the complaint and
defendant is estopped from denying in a subsequent action any allegations
contained in the former complaint”].)
Last, the Court considers and
rejects the opposition’s remaining arguments.
First, even if a meet and confer
failed to precede this demurrer (Opp’n, pp. 3-4), that is not a basis for
overruling the demurrer. Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 430.41(a)(4); see also Dumas
v. Los Angeles County Bd. of Supervisors (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 348, 355-56
[“Nothing in the text of section 430.41, subdivision (a)(4), conditions its
operation on compliance with other provisions. To the contrary, it instructs
that ‘[a]ny’ determination that the process was insufficient will not be
grounds to overrule the demurrer”].)
Next, the trial court has
discretion to consider an untimely demurrer if it does not affect substantive
rights of the plaintiff. (Jackson v. Doe (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 742,
749-750). Moreover, the 30-day language is not mandatory (“may”) and only
applies to the initial demurrer not to amended complaints. (McAllister v.
County of Monterey (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 253, 280.) The court can also
increase the time to file a demurrer “in furtherance of justice.” (See Code
Civ. Proc., §473, subd. (a)(1).) Here, as recognized by the opposition, SC
Retail’s demurrer is at most five days late, (Opp’n, pp. 4-5,) and opposing
parties have had ample time to oppose the motion. And the Court determines that
no substantive right of Keisuke SC or Ushi Ushi is implicated by a demurrer
challenging claims that should have been resolved during the unlawful detainer
proceedings. Finally, even if the demurrer were overruled, the same argument
could subsequently be raised by summary judgment or motion for judgment on the pleadings.
Consequently, the Court permits the hearing on this demurrer to go forward even
if untimely filed.
Last, leave to amend need not be
granted here where amendment cannot cure the res judicata bars arising from the
underlying unlawful detainer actions. (Opp’n, pp. 10-11.) The Court makes this
determination because the claims at issue in the 24STCV00971 Complaint are claims
for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and
fair dealing, i.e., claims at the heart of the parties’ mutual obligations
under the lease agreements for the subject premises. The declaratory relief
claim is derivative of the breach of contract claims, leading to the same
result. Otherwise stated, leave to amend will not cure the fact that the claims
raised in LASC No. 24STCV00971 (since consolidated) are the exact type of
claims that would have served as defenses to the unlawful detainer proceedings
against Keisuke SC and Ushi Ushi.
Based on the above grounds, the
Court SUSTAINS SL Retail’s demurrer to the 24STCV00971 Keisuke SC and
Ushi Ushi Complaint, without leave to amend. 
III. Conclusion
SL Retail Owner, LLC’s Demurrer to Complaint [Res ID # 4348] is SUSTAINED
without leave to amend.
The Court further orders that all filings in this consolidated matter be
filed in the LEAD CASE, 22STCV01760.
