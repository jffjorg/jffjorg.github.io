And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to the demand for production (set three). The plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests, and the defendant has shown that it has a right to compel a timely response. The court has denied the defendant's request for monetary sanctions because the notice of motion and motion did not adequately identify the amount of sanctions sought or against whom they are sought. The court orders the plaintiff to serve code-compliant, verified, written responses to the defendant's demand for production (set three) within 21 days of notice of this ruling.
