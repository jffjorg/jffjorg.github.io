And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Motion to Quash or Modify Subpoena filed by Plaintiff Hengameh Hakaeian. The Plaintiff argues that the subpoenas issued by the Defendants to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, William M. Chow, M.D., Kamran Hakimian, M.D., and Anthem Blue Cross are overly broad and invade the Plaintiff's right to privacy. The Judge agrees, finding that the language of the subpoenas is too broad and that the Plaintiff has made a sufficient showing that the requested production would invade the Plaintiff's protected privacy. The Judge also notes that the Defendants have not shown a countervailing interest sufficient to support the compelled production of the requested information. Therefore, the Judge grants the Plaintiff's Motion to Quash the Subpoenas and quashes the Subpoenas issued in this matter.
