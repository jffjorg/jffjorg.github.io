  Case Number:  19STCV39617    Hearing Date:   January 16, 2024    Dept:  29 Status of Minor’s
Compromise for Dontae Baker (Age 9)
 
Tentative:
 
 
The Court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the
guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference
call.  
 
Petitioner has filed the required
forms, but there is one set of issues that remains to be addressed:
 
Item 19b(1)
in the Petition states the entire net settlement amount is to be distributed to
Claimant’s mother, as does her attached declaration. However, there are also
two 19b(1) attachments, with one stating that $15,000.00 will be distributed to
mother of Claimant and the balance of the net settlement amount ($6,666,51)
will be placed into a blocked account. 
Petitioner also filed Court Form MC-355, which is a proposed order for a
deposit of funds into a blocked account. 
 
Petitioner
does not establish that mother is guardian of claimant’s estate or provide
other authority for the proposed $15,000 distribution (as opposed to, for
example, deposit of the entire amount in a blocked account, with a simultaneous
request for a withdrawal of funds from the blocked account, with a sufficient
showing made for the withdrawal).  
 
In other
respects, the Court is prepared to grant the Petition.  All procedural requirements have been satisfied.  The Court finds that the overall amount of the
settlement and the requested attorney’s fees and costs are properly supported
and reasonable.
 
The Petitioner
to Approve Minor’s Compromise is CONTINUED to allow Petitioner to file an
amended petition to address the issue identified above.
