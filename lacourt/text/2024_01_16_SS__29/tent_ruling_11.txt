Counsel Houman Sayaghi and Antonia Holguin.
 
Tentative

Background
On February 7, 2023, Diana Ofunwa
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint
relating to a motor vehicle accident on February 26, 2021, involving Defendants
Nargis Dada, Iqbal Ahmed Dada, and Does 1 through 25.
On December 15, 2023, West Coast Trial Lawyers, APLC, specifically, Houman Sayaghi,
filed a motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. No opposition
has been filed. 
 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration, and Order to be Relieved as Counsel, but no
proof of service is included to show that it was served on not only Plaintiff,
their client, but also opposing party. 
Declaration 3(a)
is blank as to how Plaintiff was served with the Declaration.
Accordingly, the
motion is DENIED.
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is DENIED without prejudice. 
Moving party is
ordered to give notice.
