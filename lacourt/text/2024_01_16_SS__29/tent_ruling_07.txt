Background
According to the Complaint, Plaintiff Emilia Balfe
(“Plaintiff”) suffered an injury due to a dangerous condition at the premises
of 24 Hour Fitness in West Hills, California on July 13, 2021.  Plaintiff filed the Complaint against 24 Hour
Fitness USA, LLC (“Defendant”), Chris E. Dowe, and Does 1 through 100 on March
29, 2022.  
On May 16, 2022, Defendant filed its Answer to the
Complaint.  On the same date, Defendant
filed a Cross-Complaint against Artem Fradkin and Does 1 through 10.
Plaintiff amended the Complaint to name Artem Fradkin as Doe 1
on December 6, 2022.
On February 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed three motions: (1) to
compel further responses to form interrogatories; (2) to compel further
responses to special interrogatories; and (3) to compel further responses to
requests for production.  All three
motions also requested monetary sanctions. 
Following a hearing on July 17, 2023, the Court granted all three
motions and also granted Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.  The Court ordered Defendant to serve
verified, code-compliant, written responses, without objection, to Form
Interrogatories Nos. 12.6, 16.2, 16.3, 16.4, and 16.5; Special Interrogatories Nos.
17 and 22; and Requests for Production Nos. 1-23 within 30 days. 
Defendant served further responses to the Form Interrogatories
and Requests for Production on August 17, 2023. 
(Allton Decls., ¶¶ 12 & Exhs. B.). 
Plaintiff contends that the responses are still not code-compliant. 
On October 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed the two motions that are
currently before the Court: to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories
and Requests for Production.  The hearing
was initially set for December 14, 2023, and was then continued, on the Court’s
own motion, to January 16, 2024.
Defendant has not filed any opposition to either motion.  On January 11, 2024, only two court days
before the continued hearing date, Defendant’s counsel filed a declaration stating
that further responses were served on January 11.  (Wong Decl., ¶ 3 & Exhs. B-C.) 
Discussion
The Court will hear from counsel regarding what, if any, disputes
remain following service of the further amended discovery responses on January
11, 2024.
