The Judge has granted the motion to continue the trial date filed by PV Holding Corp. The complaint was filed by Santiago Merlos and Nelson Blanco on October 4, 2021, alleging negligence claims arising from a motor vehicle incident on October 15, 2019. PV Holding Corp. filed the motion to continue the trial on December 11, 2023, citing good cause for the continuance. The Judge considered the factors outlined in California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(c) and (d), including the proximity of the trial date, the length of the continuance requested, and the availability of alternative means to address the problem. The Judge determined that PV Holding Corp. has made a showing of good cause to continue the trial date to hear its Motion for Summary Judgment, and therefore granted the motion. The trial is continued to mid-March 2025, with a Final Status Conference set for February 27, 2025.
