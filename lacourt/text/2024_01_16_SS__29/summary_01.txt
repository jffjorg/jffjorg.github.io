And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Dontae Baker, a 9-year-old minor, regarding the approval of a settlement and distribution of funds. The Judge excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem, allowing counsel to appear by telephone or video conference. The Petitioner has filed the required forms, but there is one issue that remains to be addressed: the distribution of the settlement funds. The Judge finds that the Petitioner does not establish the Claimant's mother as the guardian of the Claimant's estate or provide authority for the proposed $15,000 distribution. The Court is prepared to grant the Petition in all respects except for the issue of distribution. The Petition is continued to allow the Petitioner to file an amended petition to address the issue.
