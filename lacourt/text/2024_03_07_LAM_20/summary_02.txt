And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to tax costs. The plaintiffs, Agustin Juarez and Fidel Juarez, are the prevailing party in the case and are entitled to recover costs. The defendant, General Motors LLC, objects to certain costs, including jury fees, deposition costs, and service of process costs. The judge finds that some of these costs are reasonable and necessary, including the jury fees and the costs associated with deposing non-party witnesses. The judge also finds that the appearance fee for the PMQ deposition and the costs associated with the ex parte application are reasonable and necessary. The judge denies the defendant's motion to tax costs and orders the defendant to give notice of the ruling.
