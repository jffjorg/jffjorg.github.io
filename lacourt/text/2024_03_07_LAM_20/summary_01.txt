And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Kevin C. Brazile has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion for summary adjudication as to causes of action 5-8 in the case of Kaplan v. Gimelstob. The motion was brought by Cross-Defendants Madison Kaplan and Randall Kaplan, who argued that the fifth through eighth causes of action in the complaint have no merit.

The dispute centers around the publication of victim impact statements and transcripts of the sentencing hearing to the media. The Cross-Defendants contend that these publications were privileged under Civil Code Section 47(d)'s fair report privilege, which allows for the publication of fair and true reports of court proceedings.

The judge found that the Cross-Defendants have met their burden of showing that the fifth through eighth causes of action have no merit. The judge ruled that the publications were privileged and that the statements made by the Cross-Defendants were not defamatory.

The judge also noted that Cross-Complainant's claims are based on the publication of the victim impact statements and transcripts to the media, and that the Cross-Defendants have demonstrated that the statements were read in court during the sentencing hearing. Therefore, the judge found that Cross-Complainant fails to demonstrate the existence of non-privileged communications that can provide a basis for claims 5-8.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on any further submissions or arguments made by the parties.
