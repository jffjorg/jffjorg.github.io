Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling concerns a Song-Beverly case where the plaintiff served discovery and the defendant failed to respond. The defendant claims that this was an honest mistake due to a former lawyer's error. The judge credits this explanation and does not conclude that the defense counsel is acting unethically. However, the judge admonishes the defense counsel to be more careful in the future. The judge orders the defendant to serve verified, code-compliant responses to the discovery propounded. The judge also grants the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, which are assessed against the defendant and defense counsel. The judge provides guidelines for discovery responses, including the importance of providing clear and specific objections and providing evidence to support objections. The judge also emphasizes the importance of the meet and confer process in resolving disputes.
