```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is troubled by the lack of progress in the case, particularly the failure to complete discovery. The court is also concerned about the parties' request for a 10-month continuance, which seems excessive given the relatively short duration of the conflicting business event. The court notes that it is congested and may be more receptive to the motion than it otherwise would be. The judge will discuss the matter with counsel to better understand the needs of the parties.
