 Case Number:  22SMCV02291    Hearing Date:   May 3, 2024    Dept:  I The court will discuss this with the parties.  The problem seems to be that plaintiff’s
condition has not stabilized and that new providers were recently disclosed in
response to supplemental discovery, one of which initially objected to
producing records and now will not produce them until after the trial is set to
conclude.  The court will discuss the
matter with the parties.  The court is
concerned about the situation, but understands what has occurred.  The parties are also willing to accept a late
2025 trial date.  Given that, the court
is likely to GRANT the request, albeit reluctantly.  There will be no further continuances.
