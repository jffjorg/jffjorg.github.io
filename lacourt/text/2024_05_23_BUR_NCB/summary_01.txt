This tentative ruling is about a motion by Plaintiffs Mario Munoz, Adrian Munoz, Michael Munoz, and Josue Herrera to file a first amended complaint (FAC) to add allegations for punitive damages against Defendants Rebecca Nicole Lennox and Brian Lennox. The Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Rebecca Nicole Lennox was intoxicated and operated a motor vehicle, knowing the probable dangerous consequences. The Court finds that the allegations in the proposed FAC are insufficient to support the imposition of punitive damages. The Court also finds that Plaintiffs have not shown by "clear and convincing evidence" that a request for punitive damages is proper. The application for leave to file the proposed FAC is denied.
