And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and discovery motion filed by the Roussin defendants against Plaintiff Judith Mendez. The demurrer challenges the complaint, and the discovery motion seeks to compel Mendez to provide further responses to special interrogatories. The hearing on these motions was originally scheduled for January 17, 2025, but Mendez requested a continuance and filed written motions to do so. The court denied these motions, finding that Mendez failed to provide good cause for a continuance. As a result, the court will hear the demurrer and discovery motion on January 24, 2025, and will consider Mendez's arguments that the court's tentative rulings are incorrect.
