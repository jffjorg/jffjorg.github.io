And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of San Gabriel Valley Council of Governments (SGVCG) vs. Careco Oil. Co. (Careco). The case involves a direct eminent domain action brought by SGVCG against Careco, after Careco claimed it would pursue a claim for lost business goodwill due to SGVCG's exercise of eminent domain power. The Judge previously denied Careco's claim for lost business goodwill and determined that SGVCG's construction activities did not amount to an actionable impairment or interference with Careco's right of access to the property. Despite this, the Judge granted Careco's motion to recover litigation costs from SGVCG, citing Code of Civil Procedure Section 1268.710, which makes the defendant the prevailing party in an eminent domain action.

In this ruling, the Judge is granting Careco's motion to strike SGVCG's costs, which were set forth in a post-judgment memorandum. The Judge disagrees with SGVCG's assertion that it is the prevailing party entitled to costs, citing the aforementioned Code section. The Judge concludes that SGVCG has no cited precedent to support its position, and therefore, Careco is entitled to recover its litigation costs.
