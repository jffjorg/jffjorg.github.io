Here is a brief English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' special motion to strike the 10th and 11th causes of action, which are claims of breach of fiduciary duty of confidentiality and attempted extortion. The judge finds that the defendants' conduct is protected under the Anti-SLAPP statute (CCP § 425.16) and that the plaintiff has failed to establish a probability of success on their claims. The judge also finds that the litigation privilege under CCP § 425.16(e)(2) bars the plaintiff's claim of attempted extortion.
