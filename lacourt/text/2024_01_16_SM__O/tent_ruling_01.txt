TENTATIVE
RULING
            Defendants Sotheby’s International Realty, Inc and Lori
Berris’ Demurrer to the 2nd and 3rd causes of action are
OVERRULED.  Plaintiff Kerry E.H Berger
plead all the essential elements of the 2nd and 3rd
causes of action, and met the heightened burden of alleging specific facts for
the 3rd cause of action for fraudulent concealment.  
 
Defendants
Sotheby’s International Realty, Inc and Lori Berris’ Motion to Strike is
DENIED. Plaintiff Kerry E.H. Berger has successfully plead the essential
elements of fraud and thus may recover punitive damages pursuant to Cal Civ.
Code § 3294(a).
 
As
a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the
face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests
the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc.
v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such,
the court assumes the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied
factual allegations. (Id.) The only issue a demurrer is concerned with is
whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) 
 
Plaintiff
is only required to allege ultimate facts, not evidentiary facts. (See Committee
on Children's Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197,
212 [“the complaint should set forth the ultimate facts constituting the cause
of action, not the evidence by which plaintiff proposes to prove those facts”);
1 Cal. Affirmative Def. § 10:2 (2d ed.) [allegations of agency, course and
scope of employment, etc. qualify as ultimate facts].) Plaintiff’s allegations
must be accepted as true on demurrer. (See Yvanova v. New Century Mortgage
Corp. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 919, 924 [“For purposes of reviewing a demurrer, we
accept the truth of material facts properly pleaded in the operative
complaint”].) 
 
I.               
Demurrer to 2nd COA – Breach of
Fiduciary Duty —OVERRULED
 
"The
elements of a claim for breach of fiduciary duty are (1) the existence of a
fiduciary relationship, (2) its breach, and (3) damage proximately caused by
that breach." (Mendoza v. Continental Sales Co. (2006) 140
Cal.App.4th 1395, 1405; CACI, 4101.)
 
As a fiduciary, a real
estate broker must disclose to the broker’s client all material information
that the broker knows or could reasonably obtain regarding the property or
relating to the transaction.
 
The facts that a broker
must learn, and the advice and counsel required of the broker, depend on the
facts of the transaction, the knowledge and experience of the client, the
questions asked by the client, the nature of the property, and the terms of
sale. Brokers must place themselves in the position of their clients and
consider the type of information required for the client to m8ke a
well-informed decision.
 
            (CACI, 4107.)
 
            “A fiduciary must tell its principal of all information
it possesses that is material to the principal's interests. A fiduciary's
failure to share material information with the principal is constructive fraud,
a term of art obviating actual fraudulent intent.” (Michel v. Moore &
Associates, Inc. (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 756, 762, internal citations
omitted.) 
 
            Plaintiff
Kerry E.H. Berger, as trustee of the Kerry Ellen Hersch Family Trust (“Berger”)
successfully plead all the elements of the second cause of action for breach of
fiduciary duty:
 
(1) Berger pleads
that Defendants Sotheby’s International Realty, Inc,  Lori Berris, and DOES 11–20 (“Sotheby’s
Defendants”) were the brokers and brokerage firm for both the seller and
Berger. (Compl., ¶ 8.) 
 
(2) Berger pleads
that the Sotheby’s Defendants owe Berger a fiduciary duty of care and loyalty.
(Id., ¶ 18.) 
 
(3) Berger pleads
that the Sotheby’s Defendants breached their fiduciary duty to Berger through “intentionally
concealing from Berger the fact that the condominium complex was being
inspected for structural damage to its balcony support columns, and that if
sufficient damage were found, then expensive repairs would be necessary, a
portion of which would be assessed to Berger.” (Id., ¶ 19; see also Id.,
9–12.) 
(4) Berger pleads
that due to the Sotheby’s Defendants breach of fiduciary duty Berger was
damaged at an estimated amount of $120,000. (Id., ¶ 20.) 
 
II.            
Demurrer to 3rd Cause of Action for
Fraudulent Concealment - OVERRULED
 
            “The
required elements for fraudulent concealment are: (1) concealment or
suppression of a material fact; (2) by a defendant with a duty to disclose the
fact to the plaintiff; (3) the defendant intended to defraud the plaintiff by
intentionally concealing or suppressing the fact; (4) the plaintiff was unaware
of the fact and would not have acted as he or she did if he or she had known of
the concealed or suppressed fact; and (5) plaintiff sustained damage as a
result of the concealment or suppression of the fact.”  (Graham v. Bank
of America, N.A. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 594, 606.)
 
            Berger
successfully plead all the elements of the 3rd cause of action for
fraudulent concealment:
 
(1)  
Berger pleads that at no point in time did any of the
Sotheby’s Defendants inform Berger of the balcony support column issues prior
to the close of escrow. (Compl., ¶ 12; see also id., ¶¶ 9–11.)
(2)  
Berger pleads that the Sotheby’s Defendants owed Berger
a fiduciary duty of care and loyalty and thus “were bound to disclose to Berger
the existence of the ongoing inspections of the condominium complex’s balcony
support columns.” (Id., ¶ 23.)
(3)  
Berger pleads that the Sotheby’s Defendants were aware
of the balcony support column structural damage issue and intentionally
concealed the information from Berger. (Id., ¶¶ 9–12, 19, 24.)
(4)  
Berger pleads that Berger was unaware of the possible
structural damage issue, relied on the information provided by the Sotheby’s
Defendants, and if Berger knew of the issue Berger would have canceled the
escrow. (Id., ¶ 25.)
(5)  
Berger pleads that due to alleged intentional
concealment of the “existence of the ongoing inspections of the condominium
complex’s balcony support columns, Berger has suffered damages in an amount
according to proof, presently estimated to be in excess of $120,000.00.” (Id.,
¶ 27.)
 
III.          
Sotheby’s Defendants Motion to Strike Punitive
Damages
 
            “[A]
motion to strike is generally used to reach defects in a pleading which are not
subject to demurrer. A motion to strike does not lie to attack a complaint for
insufficiency of allegations to justify relief; that is a ground for general
demurrer.” (Pierson v. Sharp Memorial Hospital, Inc. (1989) 216
Cal.App.3d 340, 342.) A motion to strike may be directed to all or a portion of
a complaint, cross-complaint, answer, or demurrer. (See Code Civ Proc., § 435,
subdiv., (a).) On a motion to strike, a judge must read the complaint as a
whole, considering all parts in their context, and must assume the truth of all
well-pleaded allegations. (See Atwell Island Water Dist. v. Atwell Island
Water Dist. (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 624, 628, as modified (Feb. 27, 2020).)
            
            Whether
Defendants’ conduct is “despicable conduct” is a question of fact for the jury
that a court should not decide in ruling on a motion to strike. (Robinson v.
Managed Accounts Receivable Corp., (2009) 654 F. Supp. 2d 1051, 1065.)
 
            A plaintiff
has the right to recover punitive damages against a defendant “where it is
proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of
oppression, fraud, or malice....” (Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(a).) Fraud is defined
as “an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact
known to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of
thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing
injury.” (Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(c)(3).)
 
            “In
passing on the correctness of a ruling on a motion to strike, judges read
allegations of a pleading subject to a motion to strike as a whole, all parts
in their context, and assume their truth.” (Dhital v. Nissan North America,
Inc. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 828, 836–837.)
 
            “In
determining whether a complaint states facts sufficient to sustain punitive
damages, the challenged allegations must be read in context with the other
facts alleged in the complaint. Further, even though certain language pleads
ultimate facts or conclusions of law, such language when read in context with
the facts alleged as to defendants' conduct may adequately plead the evil
motive requisite to recovery of punitive damages.  (Monge v. Superior Court (1986) 176
Cal.App.3d 503, 510.) “Malice and oppression may be inferred from the
circumstances of a defendant's conduct.” (Id., at p. 511.)
 
            Here,
Berger pleads enough specific facts within the complaint to state, and infer, that
the Sotheby’s Defendants allegedly committed a fraudulent act by intentionally
concealed specific information to Berger’s financial detriment. (Compl., ¶¶ 7,
11, 20, 26.) Thus, the Sotheby’s Motion to Strike Punitive damages from the
Complaint is DENIED.
