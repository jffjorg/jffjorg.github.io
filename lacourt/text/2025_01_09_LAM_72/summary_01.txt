And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jocelyn Munoz vs. Kia America, Inc. et al. The plaintiff has moved to compel further responses to special interrogatories and seeks sanctions of $3,345. The court denies the motion, finding that the interrogatories seek overbroad and irrelevant information.

The plaintiff has also moved to compel further responses to Form Interrogatory 15.1 and seeks sanctions in the amount of $2,355. The court grants the motion, finding that the defendant's response fails to state the grounds separately for each affirmative defense. The defendant is ordered to provide a further verified response within 30 days and pay the plaintiff's counsel $1,000 in attorney's fees within 30 days.

The court also admonishes Attorneys Roger Kirnos and Phil A. Thomas, and their law firm Knight Law Group LLP, for their inappropriate and unacceptable legal advocacy. The court finds that their reply brief includes a personal attack on opposing counsel, which is reprehensible and violates norms of civility. The court warns that such tactics may be grounds for sanctions or a lower award of attorney's fees in the future.
