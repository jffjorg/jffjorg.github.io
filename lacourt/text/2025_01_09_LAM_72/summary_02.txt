And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied plaintiff Jocelyn Munoz's request for sanctions against defendant Starbucks Corporation. The dispute was over whether defendant's responses to plaintiff's discovery requests were sufficient. The judge found that while defendant's initial responses were not unreasonable, they may have lacked merit. Despite this, the court did not grant sanctions because defendant was able to resolve the dispute. The motion to compel responses to discovery requests is considered moot, and the only issue remaining is the request for sanctions.
