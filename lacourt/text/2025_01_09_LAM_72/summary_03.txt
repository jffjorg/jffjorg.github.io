And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Tracfone Wireless, Inc.'s motion to set aside the default entered against it on November 19, 2024. The default was caused by the attorney's mistake in failing to receive a copy of the order denying arbitration, which resulted in no deadline to file an answer being calendared. The judge finds that the second default was also caused by the attorney's mistake and grants the motion. The judge also assesses a penalty of $1,000.00 against Defendant's law firm under Code of Civil Procedure section 473 and awards costs to Plaintiff, including $21.37 in filing fees and $27.00 in estimated costs of filing the opposition.
