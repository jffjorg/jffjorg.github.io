JOCELYN MUNOZ, 
 
                                  Plaintiff,
  
         v.
 
 
STARBUCKS CORP.., et al.,

 Hearing Date:  January 9, 2025
 Calendar Number:  3



 
Plaintiff Jocelyn Munoz (“Plaintiff”) moves to compel
responses to certain special interrogatories and requests for production served
on Defendant Starbucks Corporation (“Defendant”) shall .  The parties appear to agree that the motion
itself is moot and the only issue is Plaintiff’s request for sanctions.  
 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s request for sanctions. The
Court has reviewed Defendant’s original responses to the discovery at issue and
while the Court would have granted the motion as to many of them, it may not
have granted the motion as to all of them. Defendant’s initial positions were
not unreasonable even if some ultimately lacked merit. While resolving the
dispute after the filing of the motion does not moot a sanctions request, the
Court has taken into account that Defendant was ultimately able to resolve the
dispute.  Under these circumstances, the
Court does not consider sanctions appropriate.
