  24STCV09823
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  January 9, 2025
 Calendar Number:  8



 
 
 
Defendant Nancy M. Chien (“Defendant”) demurs to and moves
to strike portions of the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) filed by Plaintiff
Express Restoration Corp. (“Plaintiff”).
 
The Court OVERRULES the demurrer.
 
The Court DENIES the motion to strike.
 
Defendant shall file an answer within 20 days of this order.
 
Background
 
 
Plaintiff alleges it performed cleaning work at seven
properties owned by Defendant. Defendant allegedly did not pay Plaintiff for
its services, and Plaintiff seeks to recover approximately $250,000 in damages.
 
Plaintiff filed this action on April 18, 2024, raising
claims for (1) breach of contract, (2) work, labor, and materials furnished,
and (3) unjust enrichment.
 
On October 1, 2024, the Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer
to the Complaint on the basis that the Complaint sought recovery for
construction services rendered while Plaintiff was an unlicensed contractor.
 
The operative complaint is now the FAC, which raises claims
for (1) breach of contract, (2) work, labor, and materials furnished, and (3)
unjust enrichment.


On November 25, 2024, Defendant filed this demurrer and
motion to strike. Plaintiff filed separate opposition to each. Defendant filed
a consolidated reply in support of both.
 
Discussion
 
            A
demurrer or motion to strike may be filed within 30 days after service of the
pleading in question. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.40, sub. (a); Code Civ. Proc. §
435, subd. (b).) That time is extended by five days if service is effected by
mail within California. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1013, subd. (a).)
 
            The
parties agree that the current demurrer and motion to strike were filed late.
The FAC was served on October 17, 2024. Defendant’s deadline was therefore
November 21, 2024. The demurrer and motion to strike were filed on November 25,
2024, and are therefore not timely. 
 
Defendant argues that the Court has discretion to entertain
the late-filed papers. (See McAllister v. County of Monterey (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 253, 281-282.)  While
Defendant makes an argument that there is no prejudice to Plaintiff, Defendant
does not explain why it filed the demurrer late.
 
The Court does not exercise its discretion to consider
Defendant’s late-filed demurrer and motion to strike.  Deadlines should not be ignored, and a party
is not entitled to consideration as a matter of course when they fail to comply
with deadlines.  Demurrers and similar
motions impose a burden on court resources and the Court generally expects
parties to comply with applicable rules if they wish to have them heard.
 
The Court therefore overrules the demurrer and denies the
motion to strike.
