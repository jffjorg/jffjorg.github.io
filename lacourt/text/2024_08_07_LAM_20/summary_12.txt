And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a demurrer filed by Defendants Farmers Insurance Exchange, Truck Insurance Exchange, Fire Insurance Exchange, Mid-Century Insurance Co., and Farmers New World Life Insurance Co. to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Plaintiffs Steven Souza, Steven A. Souza Insurance Agency, Inc., and SA USA, Inc. The FAC alleges intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and breach of contract.

The Judge finds that the demurrer is sustained, with 20 days leave to amend, regarding the interference claims. The Judge holds that the FAC does not plead sufficient facts to show that the Defendants' conduct was designed to cause disruption and that the conduct was independently wrongful. The Judge also finds that the FAC does not plead fraud and that the claims for interference with prospective economic advantage require a pleading of independently wrongful conduct.

The Judge also considers a motion to strike filed by Defendants, which seeks to strike the FAC as to allegations of breaches of contract and tortious interference occurring before the applicable statutes of limitations. The Judge denies the motion to strike as to SA USA, Inc. and the interference claims, but denies it as to Souza's first cause of action for breach of contract.

The Judge notes that the ruling is tentative and that parties should respond to the tentative ruling.
