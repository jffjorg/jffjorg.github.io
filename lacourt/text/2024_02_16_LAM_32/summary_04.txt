And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by State Compensation Insurance Fund (SCIF) to the cross-complaint filed by Schon Tepler Construction, Inc. The cross-complaint alleges that SCIF breached the insurance policies by overcharging final premiums, resulting in higher premiums.

The judge has ruled that SCIF's demurrer is overruled. The judge found that the cross-complaint alleges a contractual dispute, rather than a rate-setting dispute, and therefore, the administrative exhaustion requirement does not apply. The judge also found that the allegations are sufficient to survive demurrer, as they provide a reasonable inference that this is a contractual dispute about claims handling rather than a rate-setting dispute.

The judge also addressed the uncertainty argument raised by SCIF, finding that the allegations are sufficient to provide adequate notice of the claim, and that any uncertainties can be clarified through discovery.
