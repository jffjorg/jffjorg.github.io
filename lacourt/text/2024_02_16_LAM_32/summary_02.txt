Summary:
This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion to compel further responses from a defendant in an employment discrimination action. The plaintiff, Beverly Rouse, alleges discrimination, harassment, and failure to accommodate by her employer, El Camino Community College District, and its employee, Arthur Leible. The defendant served objection-only responses to 86 out of 98 requests for production, and the plaintiff seeks further supplemental responses. The judge grants the motion in part, finding that the plaintiff's need for the information outweighs the defendant's privacy concerns, and orders that production shall be subject to a protective order.
