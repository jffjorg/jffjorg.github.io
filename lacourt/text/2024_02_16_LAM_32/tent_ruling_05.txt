  HEALTH CENTER, et al.,

  Case No.:  23STCV14020
  Hearing Date:  February 16, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant SEIU Local 721’s demurrer to second
  amended complaint




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On June 16, 2023, Plaintiff Alma
Rosa Hernandez filed this action against Defendants County of Los Angeles (erroneously
sued as Los Angeles County High Desert Regional Health Center) and SEIU Local
721. The complaint was labeled as one for discrimination and violation of
labor/union rights. However, the complaint contained no factual allegations. Instead,
the complaint merely attached prior complaints filed with the Civil Rights
Department and Labor Commissioner’s Office. On August 21, 2023, the Court sustained
the County’s demurrer with leave to amend. 
Plaintiff filed her First Amended
Complaint on September 8, 2023. On November 15, 2023, the Court sustained the
County’s demurrer to the FAC with leave to amend, finding that the FAC
contained no facts beyond conclusory statements that Plaintiff was
discriminated against. On December 14, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative
Second Amended Complaint. The SAC alleges that Plaintiff was suspended for 5
days without pay for inappropriate behavior towards coworkers. Plaintiff also
alleges that she asked for union representation but was denied. The complaint
concludes with the statement: “I claim employment discrimination on the
characteristics of race, and color, national origin and reverse age discrimination.”
On January 12, 2024, Defendant SEIU Local
721 filed the instant demurrer against the SAC.1 Plaintiff has not
filed an opposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether a
pleading states a cause of action or defense. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles
Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.) In a
demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading
or by proper judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a).) A
demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic
matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior Court
(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the defects
appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a demurrer
hearing is whether the pleading, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action or defense. (Hahn,
supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
MEET AND CONFER

Before filing a
demurrer or a motion to strike, the demurring or moving party is required to
meet and confer with the party who filed the pleading demurred to or the
pleading that is subject to the motion to strike for the purposes of determining
whether an agreement can be reached through a filing of an amended pleading that
would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
430.41, 435.5.) The Court notes that Defendant has complied with the meet and
confer requirement. (See Nava Decl.) 
 
 

 
1 Defendant refers to the first amended
complaint throughout its demurrer, but its argument makes clear that it is
attacking the second amended complaint. 
DISCUSSION
            The SAC does not contain sufficient
facts to state a cause of action against the union. The SAC is labeled as one
for discrimination and “labor/union rights violated.” It is unclear which union
rights Plaintiff claims were violated or how. To the extent the discrimination
claims are aimed at the union, it is also unclear how the union discriminated
against Plaintiff. The complaint implies that Plaintiff was suspended for discriminatory
reasons, but that is attributed to her employer (the County), not the union.  
            To the extent Plaintiff is claiming
that the union failed to fairly represent her, this would constitute an unfair
labor practice under the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act (MMBA). (Paulsen v. Local
No. 856 of Internat. Brotherhood of Teamsters (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 823,
831). “The administrative agency authorized to adjudicate unfair labor practice
charges under the MMBA is California’s Public Employment Relations Board (PERB)”
(City of San Jose v. Operating Engineers Local Union No. 3 (2010) 49
Cal.4th 597, 601), or in the case of Los Angeles County, the Employee Relations
Commission (ERCOM) (Gov. Code, § 3509(d)). “[E]mployees must exhaust their
administrative remedies under the MMBA by applying to PERB [or ERCOM] for
relief before they can ask a court to intervene in a labor dispute.” (City
of San Jose, supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 601.) The statute of limitations for
bringing an unfair practice charge under the MMBA is six months. (Coachella
Valley Mosquito & Vector Control Dist. v. California Public Employment
Relations Bd. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1072, 1091.) 
Here, Plaintiff does not allege that she exhausted
her administrative remedies under the MMBA or that she did so within six
months. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition and therefore fails to explain
how she can cure this defect.  
CONCLUSION
            Defendant SEIU Local 721’s demurrer
is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
