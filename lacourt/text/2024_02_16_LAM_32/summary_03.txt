And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant Wilshire Law Firm's motion to compel further responses from the plaintiff regarding two specific discovery requests. The plaintiff had previously denied the requests for admission (RFAs) and provided supporting facts, witnesses, and documents to justify her denials. The judge found that the plaintiff's responses were sufficient and did not require further responses. The judge also denied the defendant's request for sanctions against the plaintiff, finding that the parties acted with substantial justification in their discovery efforts.
