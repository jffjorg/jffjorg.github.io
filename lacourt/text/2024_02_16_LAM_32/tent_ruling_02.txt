  Case No.:  22STCV19501
  Hearing Date:  February 16, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to compel further
  responses 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On June 14, 2022, Plaintiff Beverly
Rouse filed this employment discrimination action against Defendants El Camino
Community College District (ECCCD) and Arthur Leible (Leible). The operative First
Amended Complaint was filed on August 22, 2022. The FAC alleges eight causes of
action arising under FEHA for discrimination, harassment, failure to prevent,
and failure to accommodate. 
            Plaintiff is an African-American
female who works for Defendant as an administrative assistant. Plaintiff
alleges that her supervisor, Arthur Leible, harassed and discriminated against
her based on her race and gender. Plaintiff further alleges that she was denied
the opportunity to telework as a disability accommodation and discriminated against
based on her disability and medical condition. 
            On January 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to compel further responses from Defendant ECCCD to her
Requests for Production, Set Two. Defendant filed its opposition on February 5,
2024. Plaintiff filed her reply on February 8, 2024. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 Upon
receiving responses to its discovery requests, the propounding party may move
for an order compelling further responses if the responses are incomplete or
evasive, or objections are without merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(a),
2031.310(a), 2033.290(a).) 
MEET AND CONFER
A motion to compel further must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration demonstrating an attempt to
resolve the matter informally. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(b)(1), 2031.310(b),
2033.290(b).) The Court finds that Plaintiff has satisfied the meet and confer
requirement. (See Tojo Decl.)
DISCUSSION
Initially, Defendant served objection-only
responses to 86 out of 98 requests for production in Plaintiff’s second set of
RFPs. (Tojo Decl. ¶ 9, Ex. C.) In its supplemental responses, Defendant
maintains objection-only responses to RFP Nos. 1,2,3,4,5,20,
21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,35, 39,40,41,42,43,44,45, 46, 47, 48, 49,
50,51,52,53,57, 61,63,64, 65,66,67, 86, 87,88, 89,90,91,96,97, and 98. (Id.,
¶ 20, Ex. K.) Through this motion, Plaintiff seeks further supplemental responses
to these RFPs. 
Plaintiff contends that the requests are
directly relevant because they pertain to: (i) discrimination complaints
against Leible; (ii) Defendant’s investigation of Plaintiff’s complaints, including
declarations or statements related to such investigation; (iii) Leible’s
disciplinary record, including discipline imposed as a result of Plaintiff’s
complaints; (iv) discrimination training provided to Leible, Plaintiff, and
other employees; (v) Leible’s personnel file; (vi) Defendant’s policies and
procedures; (vii) complaints made by employees; and (viii) other discrimination
incidents. 
Although Defendant’s responses interposed numerous
objections, Defendant’s opposition narrows to two contentions: “1) Plaintiff
propounded duplicative requests as to 24 of the requests previously served in
Plaintiff’s first set of documents requests that Plaintiff never followed up
upon, and/or 2) Plaintiff overbroadly seeking personnel file information and
non-relevant complaint information regarding third parties.” (Opp. 1:9-13.)  
            1.
Duplicative
            “The court shall restrict the
frequency or extent of use of a discovery method provided in Section 2019.010
if it determines either of the following: (1) The discovery sought is
unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source
that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive. (2) The selected
method of discovery is unduly burdensome or expensive, taking into account the
needs of the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues
at stake in the litigation.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2019.030(a).)
In response to RFP Nos. 1-5, 20-28, 35,
65-67, 86-91, and 96-98 from Set Two, Defendant objected that they were
duplicative of RFPs from Set One and identified the corresponding RFPs from Set
One. Plaintiff does not address these duplications beyond concluding that “the requests
in these Set 2 are substantially different because they implicate a very narrow
band of documents that might have fallen under the original request.”
(Reply 3:16-18, emphasis in original.) That the Set Two requests are phrased
differently than Set One does not negate the fact that there is overlap between
the two sets. 
The issue of duplication is particularly pertinent
here because Plaintiff missed the deadline to file a motion to compel with
regards to the Set One responses. (See Tojo Decl. ¶ 7 [Set One responses served
on August 23, 2023]; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(c) [45-day deadline to file
motion].) Plaintiff cannot avoid the jurisdictional deadline by simply
propounding a second set of RFPs which encompasses the same information. Otherwise,
any propounding party who misses the jurisdictional deadline could simply
propound a second set of requests seeking the same information and counter any objection
by arguing that the two sets are technically different. This would render the
jurisdictional deadline meaningless.      
To the extent Set Two demands new
information, Defendant must respond. However, Defendant is not required to
respond to the requests in Set Two that ask for the same information sought in
Set One. Defendant’s failure to properly respond to Set One does not affect the
duplicative nature of the requests. If Defendant provided defective responses
to Set One, it was Plaintiff’s burden to file a motion to compel within the
jurisdictional deadline. 
                        2. Privacy
            “The party asserting a privacy right
must establish a legally protected privacy interest, an objectively reasonable
expectation of privacy in the given circumstances, and a threatened intrusion
that is serious.” (Williams v. Sup. Ct. (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 552.) If
the court finds a privacy interest, the court must balance the privacy concerns
against the need for the information. (Id. at p. 552.) Discovery of
private information is governed by the more stringent standard of direct
relevance in order to prevent a fishing expedition of “tangentially pertinent
sensitive information.” (Boler v. Sup. Ct. (1987) 201 Cal.App.3d 467,
472.) “The burden is on the party seeking the constitutionally protected
information to establish direct relevance.” (Davis v. Superior Court
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1008, 1017.)
            Courts have recognized a privacy
interest in personnel files. (See, e.g., Teamsters Local 856 v.
Priceless, LLC (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1500, 1515; Caldecott v. Superior
Court (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 212, 222.) However, Defendant and its
employee, Leible, are currently being sued for discrimination and related
claims. In the given circumstances, Defendant cannot demonstrate a reasonable
expectation of privacy in records pertaining to complaints of harassment or discrimination.
Plaintiff’s need for the information also outweighs Leible’s privacy interests
because Plaintiff is entitled to discover evidence to confirm her complaints and
to verify Defendant’s action or inaction in response to those complaints. Such
information is directly relevant. The same applies to “me too” evidence, which may
be used to establish a defendant’s discriminatory intent through a pattern of
wrongdoing. (Pantoja v. Anton (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 87, 115.)
Therefore, Plaintiff is also entitled to investigations related to other
complaints of discrimination, retaliation, or harassment leveled against Leible.
A protective order will sufficiently protect the privacy of Leible and other
employees, such that the intrusion is not serious. (See Hill v. National
Collegiate Athletic Assn. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, 38.)  
With that being said, Plaintiff has not
articulated good cause for Leible’s entire personnel file or all records
pertaining to any complaint against Leible. Discovery of complaints, investigations,
and discipline from personnel files should be limited to discrimination and
harassment based on race, gender, disability, and medical condition, the types
of discrimination alleged by Plaintiff.   
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to compel further
responses is GRANTED in part as set forth above. Production shall be subject to
a protective order. Sanctions are denied as the parties acted with substantial
justification.
