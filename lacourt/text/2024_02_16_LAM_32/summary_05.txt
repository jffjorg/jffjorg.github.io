And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by SEIU Local 721, defendant in the case. The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, meaning that the second amended complaint does not state a cause of action against the union. The judge's ruling is based on the fact that the complaint does not contain sufficient facts to state a cause of action against the union and that the complaint implies that the suspension was caused by the employer (the County) and not the union. The judge also notes that the complaint does not allege that the plaintiff exhausted her administrative remedies under the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act (MMBA) or that she did so within six months.
