And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend its discovery responses. The plaintiff made an honest mistake in its initial responses, and the mistake was discovered during trial preparation. The plaintiff's E-Commerce Merchandising Manager Timothy Lakin performed a search of Skechers' legacy administrative system to determine the dates when certain Skechers footwear products were first added to Skechers.com. However, the search yielded different results, and the plaintiff seeks to amend its responses to reflect the accurate information.

The judge finds that the initial incorrect admissions were the result of reasonable mistake, and that meaningful prejudice will not result if the plaintiff is granted leave to amend its responses. The defendants have not relied on the mistaken admissions in their pending motions, and the plaintiff has stipulated to shorten time for hearing on an amended motion for summary judgment.
