And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, Ironmark Earthworks, Inc. The plaintiff, Calex Engineering Co., filed a lawsuit against the defendant and Wendell Beniga, alleging various causes of action, including breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and violations of the Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act (Cal. Penal Code § 502).

The defendant demurred to the tenth cause of action, which alleges a violation of the Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act. The court has sustained the demurrer, finding that the plaintiff has failed to state a claim for violation of the statute.

The court notes that the plaintiff has alleged that Wendell Beniga, a former employee of the plaintiff, took trade secrets and confidential information from the plaintiff and used it to help the defendant compete with the plaintiff. However, the court finds that the plaintiff has not alleged facts that could show how the defendant allegedly aided and abetted Beniga in taking the information.

The court has given the plaintiff 15 days to amend its complaint to clarify the nature of its section 502 claim and allege facts that could show aiding and abetting beyond conclusory allegations. If the plaintiff fails to do so, the court will sustain the demurrer and dismiss the tenth cause of action.
