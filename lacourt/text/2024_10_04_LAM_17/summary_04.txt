Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash subpoenas issued by Defendant Liberty Mutual Insurance Company. The subpoenas were served on York Risk Services Group, Inc. and CopperPoint Insurance Company, seeking private employment records for Plaintiff Joy Slagel's subsequent employers. Plaintiff argues that the subpoenas are improper because they were served after the close of discovery, have no compelling reason for seeking private employment records, are overbroad, and seek impermissible character evidence. Defendant argues that the subpoenas are narrowly tailored and necessary to establish its key defenses regarding Plaintiff's mitigation efforts in securing subsequent employment and the impact of such efforts on Plaintiff's loss of wages claims. The Court agrees with Defendant, finding that the evidence sought is directly relevant and admissible to the extent it is inconsistent with Plaintiff's testimony at trial. The Court also finds that the admission of evidence concerning Plaintiff's subsequent employment would not rise to the level of "substantial danger" or prejudice necessitating its exclusion from trial. As a result, Plaintiff's motion to quash is denied.
