And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Respondent AFT College Staff Guild Local 1521A's Motion for Summary Judgment is continued to July 25, 2024, at 10:00 AM in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse. By April 24, 2024, Petitioner Velma Butler is required to file and serve a pleading setting forth the claims raised by this appeal, in substantially the same format as a complaint. Respondent is required to file and serve an answer to that pleading per the time requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure. The judge has ruled that the action is not yet ripe for a motion for summary judgment because there are no effective pleadings from which parties and the Court may reference the materiality of the issues raised.
