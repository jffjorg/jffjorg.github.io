And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Jimmy Chen's motion for reconsideration of the court's earlier orders. The case involves a breach of contract and fraud alleged by Chen against Defendant Armand Newman, Inc. dba Newman Dermatology Beverly Hills. The court previously overruled the defendant's demurrer to the breach of contract cause of action, sustained the demurrer to the fraud cause of action, and granted the defendant's motion to strike portions of the complaint. Chen filed a second amended complaint, which was also dismissed without leave to amend. The judge denied the motion for reconsideration because Chen failed to provide legal authority for reconsideration and did not comply with the court's rules regarding the contents of a memorandum.
