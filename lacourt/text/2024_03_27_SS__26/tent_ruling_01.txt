ANALYSIS:
 
On October 26, 2022, Petitioner
Velma Butler (“Petitioner”) filed the instant Appeal of Labor Commissioner
Award against Respondent AFT College Staff Guild Local 1521A (“Respondent”). The
Petition is brought pursuant to Cal. Labor Code section 98.2 and was originally
assigned to an unlimited jurisdiction court. On February 23, 2024, the Court
overruled Respondent’s demurrer to the Appeal, which was substantively a motion
to dismiss, and four days later ordered the action to the transferred to the
limited jurisdiction court. (Minute Orders, 02/23/24 and 02/27/24.) On January
12, 2024, Respondent filed the instant Motion for Summary Judgment. Petitioner
filed an opposition on March 13, 2024.  
 
Discussion
 
Pursuant to Cal. Labor Code section 98.2, Petitioner appeals
a decision of the California Labor Commissioner rendered on September 27, 2022.
(Pet., Exh. A.) Under this statute, “[w]ithin 10 days after service of notice
of an order, decision, or award the parties may seek review by filing an appeal
to the superior court, where the appeal shall be heard de novo.” (Lab. Code, §
98.2, subd. (a).) It therefore appears that where a trial de novo is authorized
in the superior court, proceedings are subject to the rules usually applicable
to superior court actions. (Sales Dimensions v. Superior Court (1979) 90
Cal.App.3d 757, 761.) Furthermore, “an interpretation of [section 98.2] must be
arrived at which, if possible, gives effect to both the term ‘review’ and the
term ‘de novo.’ (Citations omitted). Since the superior court may hear
testimony, including any new evidence, the findings of the Labor Commissioner
are entitled to no weight whatsoever, and the proceedings are truly ‘a trial
anew in the fullest sense.’” (Id. at 763.) In a case where the question
of discovery during the trial de novo was raised, the Court of Appeals
explained the broad latitude of the trial court in determining the procedures
in such an appeal:
 
The approach which we have outlined is
consistent with the power of the courts “to adopt any suitable method of
practice, both in ordinary actions and special proceedings, if the procedure is
not specified by statute or by rules adopted by the Judicial Council.” (Citations
omitted.) The superior court is vested with jurisdiction to hear the appeal de
novo. Yet, no procedures for exercising that jurisdiction are specified.
Therefore, the superior court, in the exercise of its discretion, may establish
an appropriate procedure on discovery in each case.
 
(Id. at 763-764.) Likewise, here, the Court must
establish an appropriate procedure for addressing the instant Motion for
Summary Judgment. “The purpose of a summary judgment proceeding is to permit a
party to show that material factual claims arising from the pleadings need not
be tried because they are not in dispute.” (Teselle v. McLoughlin (2009)
173 Cal.App.4th 156, 168 [citing Andalon v. Superior Court (1984) 162
Cal.App.3d 600, 604-605, 208 Cal.Rptr. 899, italics added; § 437c, subd. (a).)
Accordingly, a motion for summary judgment may only address the issues as
framed by the pleadings. (Canales v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2018) 23
Cal.App.5th 1262, 1269.) 
 
This action is not yet ripe for a motion for summary
judgment because there are no effective pleadings from which parties and the
Court may reference the materiality of the issues raised. Prior to any hearing
on a motion for summary judgment, the parties must file the equivalent of a
complaint setting forth Petitioner’s claims and Respondent’s answer thereto.
The hearing on the Motion for Summary Judgment, therefore, will be continued. 
 
Conclusion
 
Respondent AFT College Staff Guild Local 1521A’s Motion for
Summary Judgment is CONTINUED TO JULY 25, 2024 AT 10:00 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN
THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. BY APRIL 24, 204, PETITIONER IS TO FILE AND SERVE
A PLEADING SETTING FORTH THE CLAIMS RAISED BY THIS APPEAL, IN SUBSTANTIALLY THE
SAME FORMAT AS A COMPLAINT. RESPONDENT IS TO FILE AND SERVE AN ANSWER TO THAT
PLEADING PER THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
