Chen v. Newman Dermatology Beverly Hills (NDBH), et
al.MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATIONTENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Jimmy
Chen’s Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Jimmy
Chen (“Plaintiff”), in propria persna, filed the instant action for breach of
contract and fraud against Defendant Armand Newman, Inc. dba Newman Dermatology
Beverly Hills (“Defendant”) (erroneously sued as Newman Dermatology Beverly
Hills (NDBH)) on June 22, 2023. The First Amended Complaint was filed on August
30, 2023. On November 6, 2023, the Court overruled Defendant’s demurrer to the
breach of contract cause of action in the First Amended Complaint and sustained
the demurrer to the fraud cause of action with leave to amend. (Minute Order,
11/06/23.) The Court also granted Defendant’s Motion to Strike portions of the
First Amended Complaint asking for leave to allege punitive damages and seeking
attorney’s fees. (Ibid.) 
 
Plaintiff filed
the Second Amended Complaint on November 17, 2024, again alleging breach of
contract and fraud. On January 18, 2024, the Court sustained Defendant’s
Demurrer to, and Motion to Strike Portions of, the Second Amended Complaint without
leave to amend. (Minute Order, 01/18/24.) 
 
Plaintiff moves for
reconsideration of the Court’s order but provides no legal authority regarding
reconsideration. (Motion, pp. 2-6.) “The memorandum must contain a
statement of facts, a concise statement of the law, evidence and arguments
relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks cited in
support of the position advanced.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(b).) Indeed,
Plaintiff’s failure to provide a memorandum as required by the Rule is an
“admission that the [request] is without merit and cause for its denial.” (Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(a), (b); In re Marriage of Falcone & Fyke
(2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 964, 976.) Without legal authority for reconsideration
of the Court’s earlier order, the Court finds no basis to grant Plaintiff’s
request for relief.
 
Plaintiff Jimmy Chen’s Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED.
