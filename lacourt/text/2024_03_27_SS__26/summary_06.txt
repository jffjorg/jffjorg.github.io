Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled on the Demurrer filed by Defendants MH Sub I LLC and Jenny Phan. The Demurrer was filed against the Complaint filed by Plaintiff Schwartz Law, PC, alleging causes of action for intentional misrepresentation, rescission, declaratory relief, and unfair competition.

The Judge overruled the Demurrer as to the first, second, and third causes of action, finding that the Complaint sufficiently sets forth the elements for a cause of action for intentional misrepresentation, rescission, and declaratory relief. However, the Judge sustained the Demurrer as to the fourth cause of action for unfair competition, finding that the Complaint did not sufficiently plead a cause of action under Business and Professions Code section 17200.

The Judge granted the Plaintiff leave to amend the fourth cause of action within 20 days.
