  Case Number:  23CHCV01091    Hearing Date:   June 18, 2024    Dept:  F49    Dept.    F49     Date:    6/18/24     Case    Name: Hugo Moisa-Archila v. Jose Roberto Gonzalez d/b/a JRG Trucking, et    al.     Case No.    23CHCV01091            LOS  ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH  VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT  F49    JUNE 18, 2024    MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL  Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 23CHCV01091    Motion  filed: 3/13/24   MOVING PARTY: Counsel of record, Jeffrey Baraban,  for Defendant Jose Manuel Armando Lorenzo-Reyes (the “Counsel”) RESPONDING PARTY: None NOTICE: OK   RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order relieving Counsel for Defendant Jose  Manuel Armando Lorenzo-Reyes  TENTATIVE  RULING: The  motion is CONTINUED.   BACKGROUND   On April 14, 2023, Plaintiff initiated this action against  Defendants Jose Roberto Gonzalez dba JRG Trucking (“Gonzalez”), Alicia Ranee  Levalley (“Levalley”), Jose Manuel Armando Lorenzo-Reyes (“Lorenzo-Reyes”) (collectively,  “Defendants”), and Does 1 to 100 for motor vehicle negligence. The Complaint  alleges that Plaintiff sustained personal injuries and property damages as a  result of a motor vehicle incident that occurred on May 2, 2022. Subsequently,  Defendants Gonzalez, Levalley, and Lorenzo-Reyes filed their respective Answers  to the Complaint on May 8, September 5, and December 29, 2023, respectively.    On March 13, 2024, Lorenzo-Reyes’s Counsel filed the instant  Motion to be Relieved as Counsel (the “Motion”).               No Opposition papers have been  received by the Court.   ANALYSIS The court may  order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before or after  judgment or final determination upon request by either client or attorney and  after notice from one to the other. (Code Civ. Proc. § 284, subd. (2).) “The  determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies  within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,  1133.) An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council  Forms MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053  (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).)             In  addition, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subsection (d) requires that  the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order be served on  the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case by personal  service, electronic service, or mail. If the notice is served by mail, it must  be accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing that either:             (A) The service address is the current residence or  business address of the client; or (B)  The service address is the last known residence or business address of the  client and the attorney has been unable to locate a more current address after  making reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the filing of the  motion to be relieved.               (Cal. Rules of  Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (1)(A) & (2).)   Here, Lorenzo-Reyes’s Counsel has filed Judicial Council  Forms MC-051 and MC-052. However, Counsel has not lodged Judicial Council Form  MC-053 with the Court, failing to meet the requirement under California Rules  of Court, rule 3.1362, subdivision (e).   Counsel has provided a declaration stating that the Motion  is necessitated by “the lack of cooperation from the client and his refusal to  participate in the Defense and response to Discovery.” (MC-052, ¶ 2.)  Additionally, Counsel claims that his law firm had hired a private investigator  who “has been unable to locate [Lorenzo-Reyes]”, whose “estranged wife could  not give our investigator a current address or phone number for him.” (Ibid.)     The Court finds Counsel’s reasons for seeking relief to be satisfactory.  Counsel states in his declaration that the Motion was served by mail at Lorenzo-Reyes’s  last known address. (MC-052, ¶ 3(a)(2).) However, Counsel has been unable to  confirm that this address is current by contacting Lorenzo-Reyes’s estranged  wife at his last known address. (Id., ¶ 3(b)(2)(c).)   However, Counsel has not filed a copy of the proof of  service, demonstrating proper service on Lorenzo-Reyes and all other parties who have appeared in the case.  The copy of proof of service is not attached to the Motion nor separately  filed.    The next hearing scheduled for this action is a Mandatory  Settlement Conference set for November 14, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Department  F49 at 9425 Penfield Ave., Chatsworth, CA 91311. A jury trial is set for February  10, 2025 (Proposed Order, at p. 1.)   Based on the foregoing, the Court CONTINUES the Motion to  be Relieved as Counsel to allow additional time for Counsel to properly file  the mandatory Judicial Council Form MC-053 and Proof of Service.   CONCLUSION   Defendant Jose  Manuel Armando Lorenzo-Reyes’s Counsel Jeffrey  Baraban’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is CONTINUED.    Moving counsel to give notice.
