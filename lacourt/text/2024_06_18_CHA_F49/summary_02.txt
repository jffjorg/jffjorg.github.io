And here is the English text summary:

The court has ruled that the demurrer to the fifth cause of action for fraudulent concealment is sustained without leave to amend. The court found that the plaintiffs failed to plead sufficient facts to establish the elements of the cause of action, including the defendant's knowledge of the transmission defect, their duty to disclose, and their intentional concealment of the defect. The court also found that the plaintiffs failed to plead sufficient facts to establish that the defendant's concealment was done with the intent to defraud the plaintiffs. The court noted that the plaintiffs were previously granted leave to amend the complaint, but that the amendments did not cure the deficiencies in the pleading. The court concluded that the demurrer was sustained without leave to amend.
