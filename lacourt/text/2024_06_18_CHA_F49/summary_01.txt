And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively ruled to continue the motion to relieve Counsel for Defendant Jose Manuel Armando Lorenzo-Reyes from his representation. The motion was filed on March 13, 2024, but Counsel failed to file the mandatory Judicial Council Form MC-053 and Proof of Service. The court finds Counsel's reasons for seeking relief to be satisfactory, citing the lack of cooperation from the client and refusal to participate in the defense and response to discovery. The court is allowing additional time for Counsel to properly file the required documents. The next hearing scheduled for this action is a Mandatory Settlement Conference set for November 14, 2024.
