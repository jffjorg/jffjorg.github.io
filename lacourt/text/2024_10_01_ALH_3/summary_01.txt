And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further discovery responses. The motion was filed by Plaintiff Luz Mercado, seeking an order compelling Defendant ADP Technology Servies, Inc. to serve further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Three and Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two. The judge has denied the motion in part, finding that the Defendant's supplemental responses were sufficient to address the Plaintiff's requests. The judge has also denied the motion to compel further responses to certain specific requests, finding that they were overbroad or not relevant to the Plaintiff's claims. The judge has declined to impose sanctions in connection with the motion, finding that both parties had substantial justification for their positions. The hearing is set for October 1, 2024, and parties who wish to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to do so.
