BACKGROUND
 
On February 22, 2022, Plaintiff
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance (“Plaintiff”) filed an automobile
subrogation action against Defendant Luis Mancia (“Defendant”). 
 
Defendant filed his Answer to the
Complaint on March 25, 2022.
 
On May 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
joint stipulation between itself and the Defendant, indicating that the parties
had reached a settlement in the case for $10,333.35 and requested for the case
to be dismissed without prejudice.
 
On May 23, 2023, the Court ordered
the dismissal of the case without prejudice pursuant to the Stipulation for
Dismissal, with the Court retaining jurisdiction pursuant CCP § 664.6. 
 
On February 15, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment Pursuant to CCP
§ 664.6. 
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
Plaintiff prays for the Court to set aside
the dismissal entered on May 23, 2023, and enter judgment against Defendant in
the total amount of $17,020.37 for the following: the principal
amount of $22,498.53 less $8,333.35 in payments made by Defendant’s insurance
carrier,
plus interest of $1,249.90, accrued at 7% per annum since the date of default
on April 30, 2023, court cost totaling $540.34 (including $393.22 for the
initial complaint, $87.12 for the service of process fee, and the $60.00 motion
fee,) and $1,064.95 in attorney’s fees. Plaintiff brings the motion under CCP §§
664.6 and 1032, asserting that asserting that Defendant has defaulted on his
monthly payments under the stipulation, and that despite Plaintiff’s counsel
providing several notices regarding the missed payments as required by the
Agreement, Defendant has failed to remedy his default. Thus, because of the
payment default, Plaintiff brings the instant motion.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section
664.6 (“CCP § 664.6”) states: “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a) [emphasis added].) For
purposes of the statute, “a writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any
of the following [among other individuals]: (1) ¶ The party. (2) ¶ An attorney
who represents the party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b) [emphasis
added].) 
 
“On a motion to enforce, the court
must determine whether the settlement agreement is valid and binding.
[Citation.] The court assesses whether the material terms of the settlement
were reasonably well-defined and certain, and whether the parties expressly
acknowledged that they understood and agreed to be bound by those terms. [In
re Marriage of Assemi (1994) 7 Cal.4th 896, 911.]” (Estate of
Jones (2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 948, 952.) 
 
The court may interpret the terms
and conditions of a settlement (Fiore v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d
561, 566), but the court may not create material terms of a settlement, as
opposed to deciding what terms the parties themselves have previously agreed
upon (Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th
793, 810).
 
II.        Discussion 
 
A.
Retention of Jurisdiction
            
“‘[V]oluntary dismissal of an action or special
proceeding terminates the court’s jurisdiction over the matter.’ (Conservatorship
of Martha P. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 857, 867.) ‘If requested by the
parties,’ however, ‘the [trial] court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce [a] settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.’ (§ 664.6, italics added.)” (Mesa RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of
Los Angeles (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 913, 917.) “‘Because of its summary
nature, strict compliance with the requirements of section 664.6 is
prerequisite to invoking the power of the court to impose a settlement
agreement.’” (Id. (quoting Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v.
Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37).)
 
“A request for the trial court to retain jurisdiction
under section 664.6 ‘must conform to the same three requirements which the
Legislature and the courts have deemed necessary for section 664.6 enforcement
of the settlement itself: the request must be made (1) during the pendency of
the case, not after the case has been dismissed in its entirety, (2) by the
parties themselves, and (3) either in a writing signed by the parties or orally
before the court.’” (Id. (quoting Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th
429, 440).) “The ‘request must be express, not implied from other language, and
it must be clear and unambiguous.’” (Id. (quoting Wackeen, supra,
97 Cal.App.4th at 440).)
 
Here,
the parties signed a stipulation containing the parties’ agreement for the
Court to retain jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure §664.6 to enforce
the terms of the Stipulation and enter judgment in the event of default. (See 05-12-23
Stipulation.) Before dismissing the action, the parties signed the Stipulation
and submitted it to the Court. (Id.
at p. 5.) On May 23, 2023, the Court dismissed the entire case without
prejudice, according to the Stipulation, and expressly stated that it “shall
retain jurisdiction pursuant to CCP § 664.6.” (See 05-23-23 Order.) Therefore,
the Court finds that the Stipulation complies with the requirements under CCP §
664.6, and it has retained jurisdiction to enter judgment pursuant to the
parties’ Stipulation in this action.
 
B.
Entry of Judgment 
 
The Settlement
Agreement, filed on May 12, 2023, provides that the parties agreed to settle
the matter for $10,333.35, with Defendant’s insurance carrier making an initial
payment of $8,333.35. (Richard L. Mahfouz II Decl. ¶ 6, Exh. A.) Defendant
would subsequently make monthly payments of $50.00 beginning on April 30, 2023,
until the remaining settlement amount of $2,000.00 was paid in full. (Id.)
Plaintiff provides the Court with the declaration of its counsel who avers that
Defendant’s insurance carrier made the one-time payment of $8,333.35 on May 18,
2023. (Id. ¶ 7.) Counsel states that to date, Plaintiff has not received
any payments from the Defendant. (Id. ¶
9.) Counsel further avers that his office provided several written notices, regarding
the default to the Defendant on 12/06/23, 12/18/23, and 01/19/24, pursuant to
the Agreement, and that to date Defendant has failed to remedy the default. (Id. ¶¶ 9-10; Exh. B.) Per the Agreement, if
no payment correcting the default was made within ten (10) days of issuing
written notice, Plaintiff was entitled to request an Entry of Judgment. (Id. ¶ 8; Exh. A p. 8 ¶ 10.) Thus, due to
Defendant’s failure to comply with the Settlement Agreement, Plaintiff
requested that a judgment be entered against the Defendant. (Id. ¶ 11.)
The Court
finds the Settlement Agreement valid and enforceable under CCP § 664.6. Here,
Plaintiff provides evidence that the Defendant has not made any payments or
cured the default after Plaintiff sent notices. (Mahfouz
II Decl. ¶¶ 9-10.) Therefore, since a valid and signed
settlement agreement between the parties has been breached, and the Court
retains jurisdiction to enter judgment, the motion satisfies the requirements
under CCP § 664.6.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal and
Enter Judgment is GRANTED. Dismissal entered on May 23, 2023, is vacated.
Judgment is entered for Plaintiff and against the Defendant in the amount of
$17,020.37
for the following: the principal amount of $22,498.53 less $8,333.35
in payments made by Defendant’s insurance carrier, plus interest of $1,249.90, accrued at
7% per annum since the date of default on April 30, 2023, court cost totaling
$540.34, and $1,064.95 in attorney’s fees.
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Co.’s Motion
to Vacate the Dismissal Entered on 05/23/2023, to Enforce the Settlement
Agreement, and to Enter Judgment is GRANTED.
 
Judgment By Court On Stipulation Pursuant to CCP 664.6 is
entered for Plaintiff and against the Defendant in the amount of $17,020.37.


Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
