[1] The
Court notes that throughout both Plaintiff’s separate statement and
accompanying declaration, Plaintiff essentially provides similar information
regarding entering an agreement with the Defendant, Plaintiff’s performance
under the agreement, Defendant’s breach under the agreement, and Plaintiff’s subsequent
damage because of Defendant’s breach. For the sake of efficiency, the Court
summarizes and cites to the instances identified as part of Plaintiff’s
evidence.
