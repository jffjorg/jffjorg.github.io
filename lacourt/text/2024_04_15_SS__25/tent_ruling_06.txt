BACKGROUND
 
On March 08, 2022, Plaintiff Nishantha Pitigala
(“Plaintiff”) filed a cause of action against Defendant Citibank (“Defendant”
or Citibank”) for breach of fiduciary duty. 
 
On October 30, 2023, Plaintiff requested entry of default
against Defendant and default was entered by the Clerk on the same day. 
 
On December 07, 2023, Defendant filed a Motion to Set Aside
Default and for Leave to Defend Action. The Court granted Defendant’s motion
and vacated the default entered on October 30, 2023. 
 
On January 23, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion to
Quash Service of Summons. Defendant filed an amended notice of motion on
January 30, 2024. 
 
On March 04, 2024, the Court on its own motion continued
the hearing on the instant Motion to April 15, 2024. 
 
No opposition has been filed. 
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
Defendant prays for the Court to issue an order quashing the
service of summons on Defendant, pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure §§ 418.10 and 415.10. Defendant argues that it
was not properly served with the summons and complaint as Plaintiff served the
summons on CT Corporation System which Defendant asserts is not its agent for service
of process nor was it at the time service was rendered on March 09, 2022. Thus,
Defendant argues that it did not receive actual notice of the litigation
because Plaintiff’s issuance of personal service on CT Corporation was
improper. 
 
OPPOSITION
 
            No
opposition has been filed. 
 
REPLY
 
            In reply,
Defendant points out that Plaintiff has failed to file an opposition to
Defendant’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons.
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard
“‘Service of process, under longstanding tradition in our
system of justice, is fundamental to any procedural imposition on a named
defendant.’ [Citation.]”  (AO Alfa-Bank v. Yakovlev (2018)
21¿Cal.App.5th 189, 202.)  “To establish personal jurisdiction, compliance
with statutory procedures for service of process is essential.”  (Kremerman
v. White (2021). 71 Cal.App.5th 358, 371.)  Defendant’s knowledge of
the action does not dispense with statutory requirements for service of
summons.  (Kappel v. Bartlett (1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1457, 1466.) 
 
“A defendant, on or before the
last day of his or her time to plead or within any further time that the court
may for good cause allow” may move “to quash service of summons on the ground
of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her” that results from lack of
proper service.  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 418.10(a)(1).  A defendant has
30 days after the service of the summons to file a responsive pleading. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 412.20(a)(3).) 
 
“When a
defendant challenges the court’s personal jurisdiction on the ground of
improper service of process ‘the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the
existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an
effective service.’” (Summers v.
McClanahan¿(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413.) 
 
II.        Discussion 
 
On March 24, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Proof of Service,
showing that on March 09, 2022, Defendant was served by Personal Service.
Specifically, the Summons, complaint, and other documents were left with Daisy
Montenegro, an authorized person, at 330 North NBrand Blvd. Ste. 700, Glendale,
CA, 91203. (03-24-22 Proof of Service.; See also 10-30-23 Proof of Service.) The Proof of
Service is signed by a registered California process server under penalty of
perjury. (Id.). “Evidence Code section 647 provides that a registered
process server’s declaration of service establishes a presumption affecting the
burden of producing evidence of the facts stated in the declaration. 
[Citation.]”  (American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011)
199¿Cal.App.4th 383, 390; Evid. Code § 647.) 
 
Defendant submits its affidavit as well as the affidavit of
its counsel, in which both explain that Plaintiff served the Summons and
Complaint on CT Corporation System as the purported agent for service of
process for Citibank. (Kelly Andrew Beall Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. 1; Citibank Decl. ¶
5.) However, Defendant swears that CT Corporation System was not and currently
is not Citibank’s agent for service. (Citibank Decl. ¶ 6.) Defendant further states
that on or about March 31, 2022, CT Corporation System sent a letter to Plaintiff
and to the Los Angeles County Superior Court expressly advising that it was not
Citibank’s agent for service of process. (Id. ¶ 7; Exh. 1.) Moreover, Defendant
avers that its records reflect that it was never served with the Summons and
Complaint in this case. (Id. ¶ 8.)
 
No opposition has been filed by
Plaintiff. 
 
The Court finds that Defendant
has overcome the presumption established by the Proof of Service filed on both October
30, 2023, and March 24, 2022. Code of Civil Procedure § 416.10(a) provides that
service can be rendered on a corporation’s authorized agent of service. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 416.10.) Here, Defendant provides evidence that they had no
knowledge of the litigation against them, and that CT Corporation System is not
an identified agent of service for Citibank. Therefore, since CT Corporation is
not Defendant’s authorized agent of service, service was not proper in this
matter under CCP §§ 416.10(a) and 418.10. 
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
            Defendant Citibank,
N.A.’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons (filed on 03/24/2022) is GRANTED. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
