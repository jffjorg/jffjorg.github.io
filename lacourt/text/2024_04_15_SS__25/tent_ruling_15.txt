BACKGROUND
On February 23, 2023, Plaintiff
Arbat, a Law Corporation, a corporation (“Plaintiff”) filed three causes of
action against the Defendant Anita Esquivel Muniz (“Defendant”)  stemming from prior legal services conducted
by Plaintiff on behalf of Defendant. 
 
On October 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Motion
to Deem the Truth of Matters in Requests for Admission Set One Admitted and
Request for Monetary Sanctions (the “Motion”). The Court granted Plaintiff’s
discovery motion, deeming its RFAs as admitted and issued sanctions in the
amount $760.00 against the Defendant.
On December 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Summary
Judgment or in the Alternative Summary Adjudication. 
No opposition has been filed.
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
             Plaintiff prays for the Court to enter summary
judgment or in the alternative summary adjudication pursuant to CCP § 437(c)
for its three causes of action for breach of contract. Plaintiff asserts that there
is no material issue of fact and that it has established the elements of its
breach of contract claims and that Defendant’s Answer does not set forth any
factually supported defenses to Plaintiff’s claim. Thus,
Plaintiff asserts that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 
 
OPPOSITION
 
            No
opposition has been filed. 
 
REPLY
 
            No reply
has been filed.   
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Evidentiary
Motions 
Plaintiff’s requests for the Court to
take judicial notice of Plaintiff’s Complaint (Los Angeles County
Superior Court Case No. 23STLC01322) (Exhibit 1); Defendant’s Answer to Plaintiff’s Complaint
(Exhibit 2); Declaration of Deian V. Kazachki in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion
for Order Deeming Facts and Documents Admitted and Request for Monetary
Sanctions (Exhibit 3); and the Court’s
order dated November 29, 2023 (Exhibit 4), are GRANTED under Evidence Code Section 452(d) because each
exhibit is a record of the Los Angeles Superior Court. 
II.        Legal
Standard
 A party seeking summary judgment has
the burden of producing evidentiary facts sufficient to entitle him/her to
judgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(c).) The moving party must
make an affirmative showing that he/she is entitled to judgment irrespective of
whether or not the opposing party files an opposition. (Villa v. McFerren
(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 733, 742- 743.) Thus, “the initial burden is always on
the moving party to make prima facie showing that there are no triable issues
of material fact.” (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519 (citing Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001)
25 Cal.4th 826, 850.). When a plaintiff seeks summary judgment, he/she must
produce admissible evidence on each element of each cause of action on which
judgment is sought. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c(p)(1).) The moving party’s
“affidavits must cite evidentiary facts, not legal conclusions, or ‘ultimate’
facts” and the courts must construe the evidence in support of the opposing
party, resolving any doubts in favor of the opposing party. (Hayman v. Block
(1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 629, 639; Scalf, 128 Cal.App.4th at 1519; Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) 
The opposing
party on a motion for summary judgment is under no evidentiary burden to
produce rebuttal evidence until the moving party meets his or her initial
movant’s burden. (Binder v. Aetna Life Insurance Company (1999) 75
Cal.App.4th 832, 840.) Once the initial movant’s burden is met, then the burden
shifts to the opposing party to show, with admissible evidence, that there is a
triable issue requiring the weighing procedures of trial. (Code Civ. Proc. §
437c(p).) The opposing party may not simply rely on his/her allegations to show
a triable issue but must present evidentiary facts that are substantial in
nature and rise beyond mere speculation. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 151, 162.) Summary judgment must be granted “if all the evidence
submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and
uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) 
 
As to any
alternative request for summary adjudication of issues, such alternative relief
must be clearly set forth in the Notice of Motion and the general
burden-shifting rules apply but the issues upon which summary adjudication may
be sought are limited by statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c(f)(1).) “A motion
for summary adjudication shall be granted only if it completely disposes of a
cause of action, an affirmative defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of
duty.” (Id.) 
 
III.       Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff moves for summary judgment
and in the alternative summary adjudication against Defendant for each of its
causes of action for breach of contract on the grounds that it has established all
the elements of its claim and that based on its evidence presented, there is no
genuine issue as to any material fact. 
            
As the moving party, Plaintiff
has the burden to show, through admissible evidence, that there is no genuine
dispute of material fact as to each element of its cause of action for breach
of contract.
 
“The standard
elements of a claim for breach of contract are: ‘(1) the contract, (2) plaintiff’s
performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4)
damage to plaintiff therefrom.’” (Wall Street Network, Ltd. v. New York
Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178.) 
 
            Plaintiff provides the following evidence. On February 04,
March 30, and April 22, 2019, the parties entered into three valid contracts under
which Defendant retained Plaintiff to provide Defendant with legal services in
connection with a civil quiet title action, child custody and child
support related matters, and a collections matter, respectively.[1] (Deian
V. Kazachki Decl. ¶¶ 3,6, 9; Exhs. 1,3,5, 8, 9; RFAs Nos. 1, 2, 3,10,11,12.) The
parties agreed in the First and Second Agreement that Plaintiff would bill
Defendant pursuant to the hourly rates of the individuals providing services at
$200 per hour for attorney time and $55 per hour for Paralegal and Office
Assistant time. (Kazachki Decl. ¶¶ 4, 7; Exhs. 1, 3, 8, 9; RFAs Nos.1, 2, 10,
11.) The parties agreed in the Third Agreement that Plaintiff would bill
Defendant pursuant to the hourly rates of the individuals providing services at
$125 per hour for attorney time and $25 per hour for Paralegal and Office
Assistant time. (Kazachki Decl. ¶ 10; Exhs. 5, 8, 9; RFAs Nos. 3, 12.) Plaintiff
performed all covenants, conditions, and promises required to be performed on
their part in accordance with each agreement. (Kazachki Decl. ¶¶ 5, 8, 11; Exhs.
1, 3, 5, 8, 9; RFAs Nos. 1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 12.) 
 
Plaintiff additionally provides
evidence that it issued timely and detailed invoices for the Defendant. (Kazachki
Decl. ¶¶ 5, 8, 11; Exhs. 1, 3, 5, 8, 9; RFAs Nos. 13, 14, 15.) In each instance,
Defendant failed to fully pay Plaintiff’s fees as they became due thus
breaching each agreement. (Kazachki Decl. ¶¶ 12, 18, 19, 20; Exhs. 1, 3, 5, 8, 9;
RFAs Nos. 4, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15.) For the First Agreement Defendant owed
Plaintiff $9,465.33 plus $3,461.97 for a total amount of $12,927.30. (Kazachki
Decl. ¶¶ 12, 18; Exhs. 1, 8, 9; RFAs Nos. 4, 6, 7, 13.) In the Second
Agreement, Defendant owed $7,18761 plus $2,573.75 in interest for a total
amount of $9,761.36. (Kazachki Decl. ¶¶ 12, 19; Exhs. 5, 8, 9; RFAs Nos. 4, 6,
7, 14.) Finally, under the Third Agreement, Defendant owed $1,478.76 plus
$514.12 in interest for a total of $1,992.88. (Kazachki Decl. ¶¶ 12, 20; Exhs.
5, 8, 9; RFAs Nos. 4, 6, 7, 15.) As a result of Defendant’s breach of each
agreement, Plaintiff was injured in the sum of $12,927.30, $9,761.36, and
$1,992.88 respectively. (Kazachki Decl. ¶¶ 12,19, 20; Exhs. 5, 8, 9; RFAs Nos.
4, 6, 7, 15.) 
 
            The Court
finds that Plaintiff has met its burden of production. Here, Plaintiff provides
evidence that the parties entered into three agreements for legal services. Plaintiff
performed all covenants, conditions, and promises required to be performed on
their part in accordance with each agreement. Defendant breached the agreement
by failing to pay Plaintiff for the services rendered as they became due. As a
result of Defendants failure to pay, Plaintiff incurred a net total of $24,681.54
in damages for the three agreements breached. The Court notes that Defendant
does not provide any evidence that contradicts Plaintiff’s evidence. Moreover, based
on the RFA’s deemed as admitted, Defendant admits to entering the agreements
with Plaintiff, owing Plaintiff the amounts specified, and failing to pay when
payment was due. (11/29/23 Minute Order.) Thus, since Plaintiff has carried its
burden under CCP § 437c(p)(1), Plaintiff is therefore entitled to judgment as a
matter of law. 
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment in the amount of $24,681.54, plus costs of suit, and
reasonable attorney’s fees according to proof. 
 
IV.       Conclusion 
                        
Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.  
 
Judgment is entered for Plaintiff and against Defendant Anita
Esquivel Muniz in the amount of $24,681.54, plus costs of suit and
reasonable attorney’s fees according to proof.
 
Counsel for Plaintiff is ordered to serve and electronically submit
a proposed form of Judgment, consistent with this Court’s order, within
10-court days.
 
The 08/22/2024 Trial date is advanced to this date and hereby
taken off calendar. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
