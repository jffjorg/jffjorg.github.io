Summary:
The court has denied Plaintiff Jordan Brown's Motion for Reclassification from the Limited Civil Jurisdiction to the Unlimited Civil Jurisdiction Court. The court found that Plaintiff has demonstrated a possibility that his claimed damages will exceed the jurisdictional limit of $35,000. However, the court was not convinced that Plaintiff meets his burden of showing good cause for not seeking reclassification earlier. The court noted that Plaintiff did not file the instant motion until the day before the parties were set to go to trial, and that Plaintiff's counsel previously considered reclassification but failed to do so.
