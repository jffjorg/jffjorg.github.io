And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Citibank, has filed a motion to quash service of summons, arguing that it was not properly served with the summons and complaint. The defendant claims that it was not the agent for service of process for CT Corporation System, which was allegedly served with the documents on March 09, 2022. The court finds that the defendant has overcome the presumption established by the proof of service and that service was not proper in this matter. Therefore, the court grants the defendant's motion to quash service of summons.
