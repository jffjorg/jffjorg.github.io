BACKGROUND
 
On April 07, 2022, Plaintiff State
Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance (“Plaintiff”) filed an automobile subrogation
action against Defendants Alfredo Nunez (“Nunez”) and Maria Delosangeles aka
Maria Duran aka Maria De Los Angeles Mosqueda (“Delosangeles”) (collectively “Defendants”).

 
Defendants collectively filed their
Answer to the Complaint on September 19, 2022.
 
On August 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed
a joint stipulation between itself and Defendant Nunez, indicating that the
parties had reached a settlement in the case for $8,500.00 and requested that
the case to be dismissed without prejudice.
 
On August 23, 2023, the Court
ordered the dismissal of the case without prejudice pursuant to the Stipulation
for Dismissal, with the Court retaining jurisdiction pursuant CCP § 664.6. 
 
On January 29, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment Pursuant to CCP
§ 664.6. 
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
Plaintiff prays for the Court to set aside
the dismissal entered on August 23, 2023, and enter judgment against Defendant
Nunez in the sum of $4,000.00 for the following: the principal
amount of $8,500.00 less $5,000.00 in payments made by Nunez’s insurance
carrier,
plus court cost totaling $500.00 consisting of $370.00 for the Complaint filing
fee, $80.00 for the service of process fee, and $60.00 for the motion fee (costs
are limited to $500.00 per the agreement). Plaintiff brings
the motion under CCP § 664.6, asserting that Nunez failed to make any payments per
the parties’ Agreement. Plaintiff states that it had given Nunez notice
regarding his default in payment but has not received any response correcting
his default. Thus, because of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff brings the instant
motion.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section
664.6 (“CCP § 664.6”) states: “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a) [emphasis added].) For
purposes of the statute, “a writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any
of the following [among other individuals]: (1) ¶ The party. (2) ¶ An attorney
who represents the party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b) [emphasis
added].) 
 
“On a motion to enforce, the court
must determine whether the settlement agreement is valid and binding.
[Citation.] The court assesses whether the material terms of the settlement
were reasonably well-defined and certain, and whether the parties expressly
acknowledged that they understood and agreed to be bound by those terms. [In
re Marriage of Assemi (1994) 7 Cal.4th 896, 911.]” (Estate of
Jones (2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 948, 952.) 
 
The court may interpret the terms
and conditions of a settlement (Fiore v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d
561, 566), but the court may not create material terms of a settlement, as
opposed to deciding what terms the parties themselves have previously agreed
upon (Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th
793, 810).
 
II.        Discussion 
 
A.
Retention of Jurisdiction
            
“‘[V]oluntary dismissal of an action or special
proceeding terminates the court’s jurisdiction over the matter.’ (Conservatorship
of Martha P. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 857, 867.) ‘If requested by the
parties,’ however, ‘the [trial] court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce [a] settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.’ (§ 664.6, italics added.)” (Mesa RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of
Los Angeles (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 913, 917.) “‘Because of its summary
nature, strict compliance with the requirements of section 664.6 is
prerequisite to invoking the power of the court to impose a settlement
agreement.’” (Id. (quoting Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v.
Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37).)
 
“A request for the trial court to retain jurisdiction
under section 664.6 ‘must conform to the same three requirements which the
Legislature and the courts have deemed necessary for section 664.6 enforcement
of the settlement itself: the request must be made (1) during the pendency of
the case, not after the case has been dismissed in its entirety, (2) by the
parties themselves, and (3) either in a writing signed by the parties or orally
before the court.’” (Id. (quoting Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th
429, 440).) “The ‘request must be express, not implied from other language, and
it must be clear and unambiguous.’” (Id. (quoting Wackeen, supra,
97 Cal.App.4th at 440).)
 
Here,
the parties signed a stipulation containing the parties’ agreement for the
Court to retain jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure §664.6 to enforce
the terms of the Stipulation and enter judgment in the event of default. (See 08-17-23
Stipulation.) Before dismissing the action, the parties signed the Stipulation
and submitted it to the Court. (Id.
at p. 3.) On August 23, 2023, the Court dismissed the entire case without
prejudice, according to the Stipulation, and expressly stated that it “shall retain
jurisdiction pursuant to CCP § 664.6.” (See 08-23-23 Order.) Therefore, the
Court finds that the Stipulation complies with the requirements under CCP §
664.6, and it has retained jurisdiction to enter judgment pursuant to the
parties’ Stipulation in this action.
 
B.
Entry of Judgment 
 
The Settlement
Agreement, filed on August 17, 2023, provides that the parties agreed to settle
the matter for a principal sum of $8,500.00, with Defendant’s insurance carrier
making an initial payment of $5,000.00 by May 25, 2023. (Harlan M. Reese, Esq. Decl.
¶ 2, Exh. A.) Defendant would subsequently make monthly payments of $100.00
beginning on June 15, 2023, until the remaining settlement amount was paid in
full. (Id.) Plaintiff provides the Court with the declaration of its
counsel who avers that Nunez’s insurance carrier made the one-time payment of $5,000.00.
(Id. ¶ 4.) Counsel states that Nunez failed to make any monthly payments
pursuant to the Agreement thus putting Nunez into default (Id. ¶ 5.) Counsel later avers that, per
the agreement, on or about November 20, 2023, Plaintiff mailed Nunez a default
letter regarding the missed payments. (Id. ¶ 6.; Exh. C.) Counsel states
that the Agreement provides that if no payment correcting the default is made
within fourteen (14) days of written notice, Plaintiff was entitled to file a
motion setting aside the dismissal and have judgment entered. (Id. ¶ 7; Exh. A p. 2.) Thus, due to
Defendant’s failure to comply with the Settlement Agreement, Plaintiff
requested that a judgment be entered against the Defendant. (Id. ¶ 8.)
The Court
finds the Settlement Agreement valid and enforceable under CCP § 664.6. Here,
Plaintiff provides evidence that Defendant Nunez has not made any payments or
cured the default despite Plaintiff sending notice. (Reese Decl. ¶¶ 5-7.) Therefore, since a
valid and signed settlement agreement between the parties has been breached,
and the Court retains jurisdiction to enter judgment, the motion satisfies the
requirements under CCP § 664.6.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal and
Enter Judgment is GRANTED. Dismissal entered on August 23, 2023, is vacated.
Judgment is entered for Plaintiff and against Defendant Nunez in the amount of
$4,000.00 for
the following: the principal amount of $8,500.00 less $5,000.00
in payments made by Nunez’s insurance carrier, plus court cost totaling $500.00
consisting of $370.00 for the Complaint filing fee, $80.00 for the service of
process fee, and $60.00 for the motion fee (costs are limited to $500.00 per
the agreement).

Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Co.’s Motion
to Vacate the Dismissal Entered on 08/23/2023 and to  Enter Judgment is GRANTED.
