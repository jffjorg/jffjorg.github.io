And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling denies the Plaintiff's request for default judgment against the Defendant, Beverly Jean Byers. The Plaintiff, Morgan Lumpkins, had previously served the Defendant with a Statement of Damages on December 2, 2023, which increased the amount of damages sought compared to the original complaint. However, the Judge has voided the November 8, 2021 entry of default due to the Plaintiff's failure to serve the required statement of damages. The Judge requires the Plaintiff to seek a new entry of default and submit a new default judgment package by a certain date. Failure to do so may result in sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal.
