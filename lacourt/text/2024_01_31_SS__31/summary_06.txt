Here is the summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition for approval of compromise of claim filed by the plaintiff's counsel. The petition is severely deficient and fails to comply with the rules of court. The Judge has identified several deficiencies, including the improper use of an expedited petition, inconsistencies in the amount to be apportioned to the claimant, and the failure to provide necessary attachments. The Judge has ordered the plaintiff's counsel to file a new petition curing the defects at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.

The Judge has also granted the defendant's motion to enforce the settlement agreement, which is contingent upon the filing of a minor's compromise. The Judge has ordered the plaintiff's counsel to file a petition for approval of compromise of claim no later than February 23, 2024, and has imposed monetary sanctions of $250 against the plaintiff's counsel for failing to take a meaningful step towards the final resolution of the case.
