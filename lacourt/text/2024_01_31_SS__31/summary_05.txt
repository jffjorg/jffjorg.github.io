Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Lyft's Person Most Qualified (PMQ) witness. The parties have been disputing over the PMQ deposition categories since July 2023, and the judge finds no good reason for Lyft's delay of this deposition. The judge orders Lyft's PMQ to appear for deposition at a date, time, and location to be noticed by the plaintiffs. The parties are ordered to meet and confer on a mutually agreeable date to proceed with the deposition. If Lyft does not participate in the meet and confer discussion, the plaintiffs may unilaterally notice the deposition. The judge also awards the plaintiffs $2,000 in attorney's fees and $79.61 in costs, and imposes sanctions against Lyft and its attorney of record in the amount of $2,079.61.
