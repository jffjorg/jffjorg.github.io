And here is the summary text:

Judge William A. Crowfoot's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Yawlin Candace Chen's application for default judgment without prejudice. The ruling concludes that the Plaintiff has adequately pleaded a claim for defamation and that the proposed judgment is overly broad. The judge orders that any injunction must be narrowly drawn and apply only to the Defendant personally, without preventing her from presenting grievances to government officials. The ruling also notes that the Plaintiff failed to define what constitutes a "defamatory statement" in the proposed judgment.
