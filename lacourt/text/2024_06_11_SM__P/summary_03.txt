The court is considering an application by Bradley J. Barmen, a member of the Ohio bar, to appear pro hac vice for defendants Balmoral Farm, Inc. et al. The application is unopposed, but is incomplete as it lacks mandatory statements about the dates of previous applications and whether they were granted. The court will not grant the application until the necessary information is provided. The matter will be continued to allow for supplemental documentation to be filed.
