Amin, et al. v. Adahi, et al., Case No. 21SMCV00348
Hearing date June 11, 2024
Attorneys for Defendants Tadi Productions, Inc. dba
25Band, Askar & Ahadi
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel
 
Farbood Majd of Law Offices of MAJD & Associates,
counsel of record for defendants Tadi Productions Inc. dba 25Band, Askar and
Ahadi, seeks to be relieved as counsel.¿No opposition has been filed. 
 
The Court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. See Ramirez
v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.
¿ 
A motion to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial
Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and
MC-053 (Proposed Order). Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).
The requisite forms must be served “on the client and on all parties that have
appeared in the case.” Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362(d).
 
Counsel filed a motion with the required Forms MC-051 and
MC-052, but not the required form MC-053. Counsel’s declarations for all three
parties state that there has been an irreparable breakdown in communication
between attorney and client. Trial is set for 12/2/24, so defendants have ample
time to procure new counsel. It is worth noting that corporations may not
represent themselves. Merco Constr. Engineers, Inc. v. Municipal Court
(1978) 21 Cal.3d 724. Defendant Tadi Productions, Inc. must find new
counsel.
 
The motion cannot be granted until Judicial Council form
MC-053 is filed and served on the client and all parties. Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1362. The matter will be continued to allow counsel to file the form and
serve the client and all parties.
