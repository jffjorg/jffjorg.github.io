Nichols, et al. v.
Balmoral Farm, Inc., et al., Case No. 24SMCV00791
Hearing date June
11, 2024
Defendants’ Balmoral Farm, Inc., et al. Application to Appear Pro
Hac Vice (UNOPPOSED)
 
Bradley J. Barmen,
a member of the Ohio bar, applies to be admitted pro hac vice for
defendants. Barmen submitted a declaration but is missing some required
affirmations under Cal. Rules of Court, rule 9.40(d). Barmen’s application
states the title of each case in which he has filed an application to appear as
counsel pro hac vice in California in the preceding two years but does
not state “the date of each application, and whether or not it was granted” as
Cal. Rules of Court, rule 9.40(d)(5) requires. The application is unopposed. 
 
Barmen’s
application cannot be granted until he files an application that includes
mandatory statements about the dates of his applications and whether or not
they were granted. The matter will be continued to allow for supplemental
documentation to be filed.
