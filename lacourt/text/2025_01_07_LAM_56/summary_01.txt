And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motions filed by Jacob O. Partiyeli to be relieved as counsel for Richard Galvan and Paige Galvan. The motions were unopposed and were filed due to a breakdown in client communications, which makes it impossible for the firm to proceed with the case and act in the best interest of the clients. The court finds that the motions set forth an adequate basis for withdrawal and grants the motions. The court also notes that there is no showing that withdrawal would cause injustice or undue delay in the proceedings, as judgment was entered in the matter on December 11, 2024.
