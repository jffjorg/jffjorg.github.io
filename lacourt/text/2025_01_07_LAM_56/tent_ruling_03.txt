Dept. 56
 
 



 
MOVING
PARTY:  Defendants Rotten, Inc. and
Michael Fisher (“Fisher”) (collectively, “Defendants”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
Josh Freydkis (“Plaintiff”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
            This is a
harassment and wrongful termination action. On August 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the operative complaint (the “Complaint”) against Defendants and Does 1 through
10 alleging causes of action for: (1) unlawful harassment [Government Code
(“Gov. Code”) § 12940(j)]; (2) unlawful retaliation [Gov. Code § 12940(h)]; (3)
failure to take reasonable steps to prevent and/or correct harassment and
retaliation [Gov. Code § 12940(k)]; (4) wrongful discharge in violation of
public policy; and (5) breach of contract. 
 
            On October
21, 2024, Defendants filed the instant demurrer (“Demurrer”) to each of the
five causes of action stated in the Complaint on the grounds that they fail to
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, or in the alternative, are
uncertain. On December 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition (“Opposition”) to
the Motion and on December 30, 2024, Defendants filed a reply (“Reply”). 
 
MEET AND CONFER 
             The parties have satisfied the meet and confer
requirement. 
 
DISCUSSION
            A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) § 430.10, subd.
(e).) 
 
To sufficiently allege a cause of action,
a complaint must allege all the ultimate facts—that is, the facts needed to
establish each element of the cause of action pleaded. (Committee on
Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197,
212, superseded by statute as stated in Branick v. Downey Savings & Loan
Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) “[E]ach evidentiary fact that might
eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v.
William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) 
 
In testing the sufficiency of the cause of
action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry
v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) Courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept.
of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other
grounds, Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th
1158, 1162.) A demurrer, however, “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d
695, 713.)  
 
A demurrer for uncertainty lies where the
pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible. (CCP, § 430.10, subd.
(f).)
 
“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly
construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because
ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v.
Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616, disapproved on
other grounds in Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guar. Co. (1998) 19
Cal.4th 26, 46 [holding claims for unfair business practices need not be pled
specifically, impliedly disapproving Khoury].) As a result, a special
demurrer for uncertainty is not intended to reach failure to incorporate
sufficient facts in the pleading but is directed only at uncertainty existing
in the allegations already made. (People v. Taliaferro (1957) 149
Cal.App.2d 822, 825, disapproved on other grounds in Jefferson v. J.E.
French Co. (1960) 54 Cal.2d 717, 719-720 [statute of limitations
question].) 
 
Where a complaint is sufficient to state a
cause of action and to apprise a defendant of issues he is to meet, it is not
properly subject to a special demurrer for uncertainty. (Gressley v.
Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643 [“A special demurrer [for
uncertainty] should be overruled where the allegations of the complaint are
sufficiently clear to apprise the defendant of the issues which he is to
meet”].) 
 
First
Cause of Action – Unlawful Harassment [Gov. Code § 12940(j)]
Government Code section¿12940 subdivision (j)
governs harassment of employees under the Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA").
"Harassment of an employee, an applicant, an unpaid intern or volunteer,
or a person providing services pursuant to a contract by an employee, other
than an agent or supervisor, shall be unlawful if the entity, or its agents or
supervisors, knows or should have known of this conduct and fails to take
immediate and appropriate corrective action." (Gov. Code, § 12940, subd.
(j)(1).) Quid pro quo harassment occurs when a term of employment is
conditioned upon submission to unwelcome sexual advances. (Hughes v. Pair
(2009) 46 Cal.4th 1035, 1043.) To state a cause of action on a quid pro quo
theory under FEHA, “it is sufficient to allege that a term of employment was
expressly or impliedly conditioned upon acceptance of a supervisor’s unwelcome
sexual advances.” (Mogilefsky v. Superior Court (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th
1409, 1414.) 
 
Defendants argue that Plaintiff has failed
to state facts sufficient to show that Fisher made a sexual advance or that
Fisher communicated that Plaintiff’s employment was conditioned on acceptance
of an advance. (Demurrer, Memo of Points and Auths., p. 4.) The Complaint
alleges that in April 2024, Fisher booked separate hotel rooms for each male
and female employee to attend a week-long convention but “informed Plaintiff
that he would not receive his own hotel room, but that he would be sharing a
room with Fisher.” (Compl. ¶ 24.) The Complaint alleges that “via slack, Fisher
asked Plaintiff to inform him if that was an issue” and that “Plaintiff
responded, that yes, he had an issue with that, and that he did not want to
share a room with Fisher.” (Compl. ¶¶ 25-26.) Plaintiff alleges that in May
2024, “Fisher suddenly informed Plaintiff that he would not be attending [the
convention] and that this was Plaintiff’s last day at the company.” (Compl. ¶
29.) 
 
This is insufficient to state a cause of
action for harassment. In the Opposition, Plaintiff cites to Myers v.
Trendwest Resorts, Inc. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1425, for the assertion
that asking a subordinate to share a hotel room can constitute FEHA sexual
harassment. In Myers, however, the request to share a hotel room was one
incident in a series of unwanted advances from the plaintiff’s supervisor,
including an assault, that occurred over a two-year period. (Myers, supra, 148
Cal.App.4th at 140) In this case, Fisher stated that he and Plaintiff would be
sharing a hotel room, asked Plaintiff if he was okay with that, and Plaintiff
responded that he was not. Plaintiff does not present any case law that
suggests this alone is sufficient to state a cause of action for sexual
harassment. Thus, Plaintiff has not stated facts sufficient to allege a cause
of action for harassment. 
 
Accordingly, the Demurrer to the first
cause of action is SUSTAINED, with leave to amend. 
 
Second
Cause of Action – Unlawful Retaliation [Gov. Code § 12940(h)]
Under California case law, “to establish a
prima facie case of retaliation under the FEHA, a plaintiff must show (1) he or
she engaged in a ‘protected activity,’ (2) the employer subjected the employee
to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link existed between the
protected activity and the employer's action. [Citations.]” (Yanowitz v.
L’Oreal USA, Inc. (2005) 36 Cal.4th 1028, 1044.) Specifically, section
12940 subdivision (h) makes it an unlawful employment practice “[f]or any
employer ... to discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person
because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part or
because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any
proceeding under this part.” (Gov. Code § 12940 subd. (h).) 
 
As alleged, the FEHA retaliation claim is
based on Plaintiff’s resistance to sharing a hotel room with Fisher. (Compl. ¶¶
43-52) As discussed above, the Court does not find that Fisher’s proposition to
share a hotel room constitutes harassing conduct under FEHA and thus does not
constitute “practices forbidden under this part” as used in Gov. Code section
12940 subdivision (h).  Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s opposition to sharing a room to is not a protected activity for
which he could be subject to retaliation. Thus, Plaintiff has not stated facts
sufficient to allege a cause of action for retaliation.
 
Accordingly, the Demurrer to the second
cause of action is SUSTAINED, with leave to amend. 
 
Third
Cause of Action – Failure to Take Reasonable Steps to Prevent and/or Correct
Harassment and Retaliation [Gov. Code § 12940(k)]
Gov. Code section 12940 subdivision (k)
provides that it is an unlawful employment practice “[f]or an employer, labor
organization, employment agency, apprenticeship training program, or any
training program leading to employment, to fail to take all reasonable steps
necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring.” (Gov. Code,
§ 12940, subd. (k).) To establish this claim, a plaintiff must establish the
defendant’s legal duty of care, breach of duty, legal causation, and damages to
the plaintiff. (Trujillo v. North County Transit District (1998) 63
Cal.App.4th 280, 286-287.) 
 
Because the Court has sustained the
Demurrer as to the harassment and retaliation causes of action, the Demurrer to
the third cause of action for failure to prevent harassment and retaliation is
SUSTAINED, with leave to amend, as well. 
 
Fourth
Cause of Action – Wrongful Discharge in Violation of Public Policy
The elements of a claim for wrongful
discharge in violation of public policy are: (1) an employer-employee
relationship, (2) the employer terminated the plaintiff’s employment, (3) the
termination was substantially motivated by a violation of public policy, and
(4) the discharge caused the plaintiff harm. (Nosal-Tabor v. Sharp Chula
Vista Medical Center (2015) 239 Cal.App.4th 1224, 1234-35.) A discharge is
actionable as against public policy if it violates a policy that is: (1)
delineated in either constitutional or statutory provisions; (2) public in the
sense that it inures to the benefit of the public rather than serving merely
the interests of the individual; (3) well-established at the time of discharge;
and (4) substantial and fundamental. (Id. at 1238-39.)
 
Similarly, because the Court does not find
that Plaintiff has sufficiently pled causes of action for harassment or
retaliation under FEHA, the Demurrer to the fourth cause of action for wrongful
termination is SUSTAINED, with leave to amend. 
 
Fifth
Cause of Action – Breach of Contract 
“To establish a
cause of action for breach of contract, the plaintiff must plead and prove (1)
the existence of the contract, (2) the plaintiff’s performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) the defendant’s breach, and (4) resulting damages to the
plaintiff.  [Citation.]” (Maxwell v. Dolezal (2014) 231
Cal.App.4th 93, 97-98.) “If the action is based on an alleged breach of a
written contract, the terms must be set out verbatim in the body of the
complaint or a copy of the written agreement must be attached and incorporated
by reference.” (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999)
74 Cal.App.4th 229, 307.) 
 
In the
Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that he “entered into a written employment
agreement by which Plaintiff agreed to perform work duties for Defendant
Rotten, and Defendants agreed that “Subject to approval by the Company’s Board
of Directors and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company
anticipates granting you an incentive stock option to purchase 110,742 shares
of the Company’s common stock at the fair market value as determined by the
Board as of the date of grant.” (Compl. ¶ 75) Plaintiff alleges that he “was
not able to execute his equity options that had matured, and which was earned
compensation for the work that he had performed through his termination date.”
(Compl. ¶ 31.) 
 
Defendants
argue that Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged a contractual agreement
between the parties because the terms of the agreement, which was specifically “subject
to approval” and “anticipates granting you an incentive stock option,” lack
sufficient certainty to form the basis of a contract. (Demurrer pp. 6:25-7:15.)
The Court finds that Plaintiff has plead facts sufficient to state a cause of
action for breach of contract. Plaintiff alleges that there was an employment
agreement between the parties, which included certain terms for stock options.
Plaintiff alleges that he is entitled to those options and that Defendants failed
to fulfill this obligation. Whether the conditions for the equity component of
the employment contract were met, thereby entitling Plaintiff to the stock
options, is a matter of discovery more appropriately addressed at the summary
judgment stage. 
 
Accordingly, the Demurrer to the fifth
cause of action is OVERRULED. 
 
            The Demurrer to the first through
fourth causes of action is SUSTAINED, with 20 days leave to amend. The Demurrer
to the fifth cause of action is OVERRULED.
