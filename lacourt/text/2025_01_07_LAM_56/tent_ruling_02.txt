MOVING PARTY:  Defendant Walter Robinson (“Robinson”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
Dara Sue Crippen (“Plaintiff”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
            The case arises from a motor vehicle
accident. Plaintiff alleges that she was injured when the Lyft she was riding
in, driven by Defendant Robinson, collided with a vehicle driven by Defendant
Uriel Hernandez (“Hernandez”) (collectively, “Defendants”). 
 
On February 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative
complaint (the “Complaint”) alleging causes of action for: (1) negligence, and
(2) negligence per se, against all Defendants; and (3) false imprisonment; (4)
assault; (5) battery; and (6) intentional infliction of emotional distress against
Robinson only.
 
On October 4, 2024, Robinson filed: (1) motion
to compel further responses to form interrogatories (“FIs”); (2) motion to
compel further responses to special interrogatories (“SIs”); (3) motion to
compel further responses to requests for production (“RFPs”); and (4) motion to
compel further responses to requests for admission (“RFAs”) (collectively, the
“Motions”). On December 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed separate oppositions to each
motion (collectively, the “Oppositions”). On December 30, 2024, Robinson filed a
joint reply to the Oppositions (the “Reply”).        
 
MEET AND CONFER
            The parties have satisfied the meet
and confer requirement. 
 
DISCUSSION
             A motion to compel a further response is used
when a party gives unsatisfactory answers or makes untenable objections to
interrogatories, demands to produce, or requests for admission. (Code of Civil
Procedure (“CCP”), § 2031.310, subd. (a); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)
 
To compel a further response to
interrogatories, the movant can show that: (1) the responding party’s answer to
a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete (CCP, § 2030.300, subd.
(a)(1)); (2) the responding party’s exercise of the option to produce documents
in response to an interrogatory was unwarranted or the required specification
of those documents was inadequate (CCP, § 2030.300, subd. (a)(2)); and (3) the
responding party’s objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too
general (CCP, § 2030.300, subd. (a)(3); see, e.g., Williams v. Superior
Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 550 [defendant’s argument that plaintiff was
required to establish good cause or prove merits of underlying claim before
propounding interrogatories without merit]).
 
To request further production, a movant
must establish: (1) good cause for the production (CCP, § 2031.310, subd.
(b)(1); Sinaiko, supra, at p. 403); and (2) that a further
response is needed because (a) the responding party’s statement of compliance
with the demand to produce is incomplete CCP, § 2031.310, subd. (a)(1)), (b)
the responding party’s representation that it is unable to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive (CCP, § 2031.310, subd. (a)(2)), (c) the
responding party’s objection in the response is without merit or is too general
(CCP, § 2031.310, subd. (a)(3); Catalina Island Yacht Club v. Superior Court
(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1127), or (d) if the responding party objected to
the production of ESI on the ground that it is not reasonably accessible the
movant can show that the (i) ESI is reasonably accessible or (ii) there is good
cause for production of the ESI regardless of its accessibility (CCP, §
2031.310, subd. (e)).
 
To obtain
further responses to requests for admission, the movant must establish that (1)
the response to an RFA is evasive or incomplete (CCP, § 2033.290, subd. (a)(1))
or (2) the objection to an RFA is without merit or too general (CCP, §
2033.290, subd. (a)(2)).
 
Form
Interrogatories
Robinson seeks to compel further responses
to FIs Nos. 2.8, 2.13, 4.1, 6.5, 9.1, 9.2 and 17.1. In opposition, Plaintiff
argues that the motion should be denied as moot because Plaintiff has since
served supplemental responses to the FIs. (All Opps., Ex. 1) Robinson does not assert
in the Reply that the supplemental responses remain insufficient. 
 
As Plaintiff has since provided
supplemental responses to FIs Nos. 2.8, 2.13, 4.1, 6.5, 9.1, 9.2 and 17.1, the
motion to compel further responses to FIs is DENIED as MOOT. 
 
Special
Interrogatories
Robinson seeks to compel further responses
to SIs Nos. 5-7, 10-12, 15, 21, 24, 27-28, 31, 43, 47-51, and 63-67. In
opposition, Plaintiff argues that the motion should be denied as moot because
Plaintiff has since served supplemental responses to the SIs. (All Opps., Ex.
1) Robinson does not assert in the Reply that the supplemental responses remain
insufficient. 
 
As Plaintiff has since provided
supplemental responses to SIs Nos. 5-7, 10-12, 15, 21, 24, 27-28, 31, 43,
47-51, and 63-67, the motion to compel further responses to FIs is DENIED as
MOOT. 
 
 
 
Requests for
Production
Robinson seeks to compel further responses
to RFPs Nos. 3-4, 18-19, 21, 25, 28, and 47-48. In opposition, Plaintiff argues
that the motion should be denied as moot because Plaintiff has since provided
supplemental responses to the RFPs. (All Opps., Ex. 1) Robinson does not assert
in the Reply that the supplemental responses remain insufficient. 
 
As Plaintiff has since provided
supplemental responses to RFPs Nos. 3-4, 18-19, 21, 25, 28, and 47-48, the
motion to compel further responses to RFPs is DENED as MOOT. 
 
Requests for
Admissions
Robinson seeks to compel further responses
to RFAs Nos. 1-3. In opposition, Plaintiff argues that the motion should be
denied as moot because Plaintiff has since provided supplemental responses to
the RFAs. (All Opps., Ex. 1) Robinson does not assert in the Reply that the
supplemental responses remain insufficient. 
 
As Plaintiff has since provided
supplemental responses to RFAs Nos. 1-3, the motion to compel further responses
to RFAs is DENIED as MOOT. 
 
Request
for Sanctions
            Except in certain circumstances
involving electronic stored information, the court must impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel
further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust. (CCP, § 2031.310, subd. (h).)
 
The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed. (Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
 
Even after a party provides discovery
responses, a party can keep its motion on calendar and the court has authority
to grant sanctions, even if it denies the motion to compel responses “as
essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part.” (Sinaiko, supra, at p.
409.)
 
Plaintiff argues that the requests for
sanctions should be denied given that supplemental responses have since been
provided and because there was some confusion over whether the stay against
defendant Lyft also applied to Robinson and thus whether the Motions are
untimely.  Plaintiff served responses to
Robinson’s discovery requests on July 19, 2024. (All Mots., Shapiro Decl. ¶
11.) This action was stayed from July 17, 2024 to August 21, 2024. (8/21/2024
Stipulation and Order) Robinson had 45 days, plus two days for electronic
service, from service of verified responses to file a motion to compel further.
(CCP §§ 2030.300 subd. (c) [interrogatories]; 2031.310
subd. (c) [RFPs]; 2033.290 subd. (c) [RFAs].) 45 days, plus two days, from August
21, 2024 is October 7, 2024. The instant Motions were filed on October 4, 2024
and thus are timely. 
 
The Court also notes that the responses
served on July 19, 2024 were apparently unverified. (All Mots., Shapiro Decl. ¶
11.) While Plaintiff states that she provided verified supplemental responses
on November 25, 2024 (All Opps., Shapiro Decl. ¶ 3), she does not address
whether she properly served verified responses prior to November 25. An
unverified response is tantamount to no response at all.  (See Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)
 
In this case, the Court finds that, although
verified discovery responses have now been provided, sanctions are warranted due
to Robinson’s dilatory responses to the discovery requests and the untimely
submission of verified responses. Robinson
requests sanctions for each motion against Plaintiff in the amount of $3,020.00
based upon counsel’s rate of $200/hour for: (1) 4.2 hours drafting the meet and
confer correspondence; (2) 5.1 hours to prepare the motion; (3) 5.5 hours to
draft a reply and attend the hearing on this matter; and (4) $60 in filing
fees. A reduction is appropriate here because much of the substance of the
Motions overlaps, and the meet and confer correspondence, Reply, and hearing on
this matter address all four Motions collectively. As a result, the separate
time requested for each is duplicative. 
 
Accordingly, the
request for sanctions for the motion to compel further responses to FIs is GRANTED,
in the reduced amount of $1,060.00 based upon counsel’s rate of $200/hour for:
(1) 3.0 hours to prepare the motion; (2) 2.0 hours to review the Opposition, draft
the Reply and attend the hearing; and (4) $60 in filing fees. 
 
The request for
sanctions for the motion to compel further responses to SIs is GRANTED, in the
reduced amount of $660.00 based upon counsel’s rate of $200/hour for: (1) 3.0
hours to prepare the motion; and (2) $60 in filing fees.
 
The request for
sanctions for the motion to compel further responses to RFPs is GRANTED, in the
reduced amount of $660.00 based upon counsel’s rate of $200/hour for: (1) 3.0
hours to prepare the motion; and (2) $60 in filing fees.
 
The request for
sanctions for the motion to compel further responses to RFAs is GRANTED, in the
reduced amount of $660.00 based upon counsel’s rate of $200/hour for: (1) 3.0
hours to prepare the motion; and (2) $60 in filing fees.
 
The Motions are
DENIED as MOOT. 
 
The request for
sanctions is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to remit sanctions to Robinson in
the amount of $3,040.00 within twenty days of this order. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
