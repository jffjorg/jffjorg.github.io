  Case Number:  22STCP00618    Hearing Date:   February 15, 2024    Dept:  85 
 
Chang Ho Yoo dba PCH
Medical Pharmacy, v. Michelle Baass, Director of Department of Health
Care Services, 22STCP00618


 
Tentative decision on (1)
demurrer to the supplemental petition: overruled; (2) motion to strike: denied 



 
Respondents Department of Health Care Services and Director
Michelle Baass (collectively, “Department” or “DHCS”) demur to the Supplemental
Petition filed by Petitioner Chang Ho Yoo (“Yoo”), doing business as PCH
Medical Pharmacy (“PCH”) and formerly doing business as Midway Drugs (“Midway”)
and Bell Gardens (“Bell”). 
Alternatively, DHCS moves to strike paragraphs 4-7 of the Supplemental
Petition.
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and renders
the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Petition
            Petitioner
Yoo (PCH) commenced this action on February 22, 2022, alleging a single cause
of action for administrative mandamus. 
The Petition alleges in pertinent part as follows. 
            PCH
submitted Medi-Cal bills for payment for drugs dispensed at two pharmacy
locations, Midway and Bell Gardens, for a year before DHCS approved the enrollment
applications for these two locations on October 27, 2017, effective August 31,
2016.  Only about $37,000 was paid before
the March 7, 2016 licensure of those locations by the Board of Pharmacy.
            On October 10, 2019, DHCS began an
audit of payments to PCH, including those that predated the Medi-Cal approval.  On March 12, 2020, DHCS demanded recovery of
$2,045,350, $1,791,322.75 for claims submitted for drugs dispensed at Midway
and Bell Gardens prior to August 31, 2016 and the rest for alleged inventory
shortages from more than three years prior to the demand for
recovery.
            PCH
timely appealed the audit findings and the demand for recovery and a formal
hearing was held in January 2021.  On
December 16, 2021, DHCS’s administrative law judge (“ALJ”) issued a proposed
decision denying PCH’s appeal.  The Chief
ALJ adopted the proposed decision as the final decision on December 29, 2021.
            Yoo
contends that the doctrine of laches prohibits DHCS’s decision.  The decision also incorrectly asserts that Midway
and Bell Gardens could not bill for drugs dispensed to Medi-Cal beneficiaries before
August 31, 2016, that PCH’s submissions were false or misleading, and that it
improperly billed for pharmacies that were suspended as Medi-Cal providers.  
            The
inventory shortage allegations further are unsupported.  DHCS’s auditors could not find a single claim
in which a beneficiary did not receive the ordered drug.  Despite this fact, DHCS concluded that it could recover
based on non-specific information, which is not authorized by 22 CCR section
51488.1(a).  At most, DHCS demonstrated
that in 2020 PCH could not provide copies of all bulk purchase orders furnished
to Medi-Cal beneficiaries.  This is not
sufficient evidence to demonstrate that PCH did not furnish the drugs to
beneficiaries for every claim.
            PCH
seeks (1) an order vacating and reversing the final decision and directing DHCS
to rescind the demand for recovery, and (2) costs of the action.
 
            2. Supplemental Petition
            Yoo filed a Supplemental
Petition on September 12, 2023, seeking a writ of mandate following
remand.  The Supplemental Petition
alleges in pertinent part as follows.
 
            a. Remand Decision
            On November 2, 2022, the
court granted a writ of mandate in this action remanding the DHCS’s decision.  Supp. Pet., ¶2.  It ordered the DHCS to exercise its
discretion under Welfare and Institutions Code (“W&I Code”) section 14043.26(k)
to consider mitigating facts based on facts already in the record.  Supp. Pet., ¶2.  
            On
August 25, 2023, the Chief ALJ issued a “Final Decision After Remand from the
Superior Court” (“Remand Decision”) denying payment for services rendered at
Midway and Bell before Yoo submitted enrollment application packages for
them.  Supp. Pet., ¶3, Ex. A.  As a result, DHCS did not need to adjust its inappropriate
billing practice audit finding.  Supp.
Pet., ¶3, Ex. A.  
            Mitigating
facts considered by the Chief ALJ included Yoo’s contacts with his attorney,
his mistaken belief about his licensing by the Board, his belief that closing on
the locations would occur earlier than it actually occurred, and his general
efforts to comply with the law.  Supp.
Pet., ¶3, Ex. A.  
As for Yoo’s contacts with the attorney, counsel advised Yoo
he needed to submit an application package to DHCS before using PCH’s existing National Provider Identifier (“NPI”)
number to bill for services rendered at Midway and Bell.  Supp. Pet., ¶3, Ex. A.  Because Yoo deliberately ignored this advice,
and this potential mitigating fact did not merit an adjustment.  Supp. Pet., ¶3, Ex. A.
            As
for mistaken belief, Yoo thought that coming into ownership of a new location
inherently entitled him to use an existing NPI number to bill for services
rendered at the new location.   Supp. Pet., ¶3, Ex. A.  No reasonably prudent person who read his counsel’s
April 27, 2015 email would think so. 
Supp. Pet., ¶3, Ex. A.  Yoo
conceded that he did not really read that email.  Supp. Pet., ¶3, Ex. A.
            Yoo
also believed that escrow on the new locations would close on December 31,
2015.  Supp. Pet., ¶3, Ex. A.  It instead closed on March 7, 2016.  Supp. Pet., ¶3, Ex. A.  Assuming arguendo that Yoo’s mistaken
belief that ownership of the locations would be sufficient, he began using
PCH’s NPI in June 2015, six months before he believed escrow would close.  Supp. Pet., ¶3, Ex. A.  
            As
for Yoo’s general efforts to comply with the law, Yoo ignored advice from his
counsel when he began billing for services at Midway and Bell in June and July
2015.  Supp. Pet., ¶3, Ex. A.  This was one year before he submitted an
application to DHCS and seven to eight months before obtaining a pharmacy
permit for the locations.  Supp. Pet.,
¶3, Ex. A.  He received advice to submit
application packages on or before the closing date of the escrow transaction,
but he instead submitted the application six months later.  Supp. Pet., ¶3, Ex. A.  
            Based
on these findings, DHCS exercised its discretion under W&I Code section 14043.26(k)
to deny payment for services rendered at Midway and Bell before the submission
of an application package.  Supp. Pet.,
¶3, Ex. A.
 
            b.
Substantive Defects
            The
Supplemental Petition alleges that the Chief ALJ’s Remand Decision was in
excess of her authority.  Supp. Pet.,
¶4.  It unilaterally established a
Medi-Cal policy of “Deterring Providers’ Non-Compliance with Medi-Cal Laws and
Regulations, and the High Risk of Failing to Detect and Respond to Providers’
Inappropriate Claiming.”  Supp. Pet.,
¶4.  This violated applicable rule-making
procedure, and converted a discretionary decision to a mandatory denial of
payment to any provider prior to submitting an enrollment application for that
location.  Supp. Pet., ¶4.  
            DHCS
is only authorized to take remedial action through a Medi-Cal audit and appeal
process, not punitive measures.  Supp.
Pet., ¶5.  DHCS has acknowledged that,
pursuant to 22 CCR section 51488.1(b), when a provider has actually dispensed
drugs to Medi-Cal beneficiaries pursuant to their doctors’ orders, DHCS must
consider mitigating and ameliorative factors during an audit.  Supp. Pet., ¶5.  It failed to do so.  Supp. Pet., ¶5.  
            The
court directed DHCS not to penalize PCH as if it billed for services furnished
by suspended providers.  Supp. Pet.,
¶5.  The Remand Decision found PCH’s
conduct to be more than inadvertent or negligent, which is not supported by the
evidence and findings.  Supp. Pet.,
¶5.  
            The
Remand Decision focused on the fact that PCH billed for pharmacy products
dispensed from Midway and Bell for over a year before submitting applications
for Medi-Cal enrollment at those locations. 
Supp. Pet., ¶6.  Yoo did not know
about the practice until the administrative hearing.  Supp. Pet., ¶6.  He acknowledged that PCH should not have done
so and dropped his claim for $37,000. 
Supp. Pet., ¶6.  
            Yoo
only seeks relief for bills for pharmacy products dispensed at Midway and Bell between
March 7 and August 31, 2016, which is the period after the Pharmacy Board had
licensed the two locations and before Yoo submitted their Medi-Cal enrollment
applications.  Supp. Pet., ¶6. 
            The
Remand Decision attributed the inappropriate billing to Yoo’s ignorance and
failure to follow the advice of counsel in various emails.  Supp. Pet., ¶7.  These emails concerned the Medi-Cal
enrollment process and the Pharmacy Board licensure process.  Supp. Pet., ¶7.  They informed Yoo that he could bill for
products from Bell and Midway after the Pharmacy Board had licensed the two
locations and he had submitted their Medi-Cal enrollment applications.  Supp. Pet., ¶7.  
            Yoo
intended to only bill for that time. 
Supp. Pet., ¶7.  He thought the Medi-Cal
applications would be submitted by March 7, 2016 and takes responsibility for
the fact that this happened five months later. 
Supp. Pet., ¶7.  The Medi-Cal
auditor conceded that there would have been no overpayment for drugs dispensed
after March 7, 2016 if the applications were submitted on that date.  Supp. Pet., ¶7.  Upholding the Remand Decision would allow
Medi-Cal to not pay for products dispensed to Medi-Cal beneficiaries, which
would render 22 CCR section 51488.1(b) meaningless.  Supp. Pet., ¶7.  
 
            c.
Prayer for Relief
            The
Supplemental Petition seeks an order vacating the Remand Decision and its demand
for recovery for the overpayment for drugs furnished at Midway and Bell between
March 7 and August 31, 2016.  Supp. Pet.
Prayer for Relief, ¶1.  
 
            2. Course of Proceedings
            On February 23, 2022, Yoo
served Respondent Baass with the Petition and Summons.
            On June 6, 2022, Respondent
DHCS filed its Answer.
            On October 25, 2022,
this court granted the Petition in part, directing DHCS to consider mitigating
circumstances under 22 CCR section 51488.1(a).  
The judgment was entered on November 2, 2022 and a writ of mandate
was issued on November 8, 2022.
            On
August 29, 2022, DHCS filed the Return to the writ of mandate.
            On September 12, 2023, Yoo filed the
Supplemental Petition and served DHCS by e-mail.
            On October 13, 2023,
DHCS filed a declaration of its intent to file a demurrer and of entitlement to
an automatic 30-day extension of the deadline.
            On February 6, 2024,
DHCS filed its Answer to the Supplemental Petition.
 
            B. Demurrers
            Demurrers
are permitted in administrative mandate proceedings.  CCP §§ 1108,
1109.  A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the pleading alone and
will be sustained where the pleading is defective on its face. 
            Where
pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect by way of a demurrer or
motion to strike or by motion for judgment on the pleadings.  CCP
§430.30(a); Coyne v. Krempels, (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257.  The party
against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been filed may object by
demurrer or answer to the pleading.  CCP §430.10.  A demurrer is
timely filed within the 30-day period after service of the complaint.  CCP
§430.40; Skrbina v. Fleming Companies, (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1353,
1364. 
            A demurrer
may be asserted on any one or more of the following grounds: (a) The court has
no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the pleading;
(b) The person who filed the pleading does not have legal capacity to sue; (c)
There is another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of
action; (d) There is a defect or misjoinder of parties; (e) The pleading does
not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; (f) The pleading is
uncertain (“uncertain” includes
ambiguous and unintelligible); (g) In an action founded on a contract,
it cannot be ascertained from the pleading whether the contract is written, is
oral, or is implied by conduct; (h) No certificate was filed as required by CCP
sections 411.35 or 411.36.  CCP §430.10.  
A demurrer tests the
sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer must appear on the
face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.  CCP
§430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan, (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.  The face
of the pleading includes attachments and incorporations by reference (Frantz
v. Blackwell, (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94), but it does not include
inadmissible hearsay.  Day v. Sharp, (1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 904,
914.   
            The sole
issue on demurrer for failure to state a cause of action is whether the facts
pleaded, if true, would entitle the plaintiff to relief.  Garcetti v.
Superior Court, (“Garcetti”) (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1533, 1547; Limandri
v. Judkins, (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 326, 339.  The question of
plaintiff’s ability to prove the allegations of the complaint or the possible
difficulty in making such proof does not concern the reviewing court.  Quelimane
Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co., (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 47.  
The ultimate facts alleged
in the complaint must be deemed true, as well as all facts that may be implied
or inferred from those expressly alleged.  Marshall v. Gibson, Dunn
& Crutcher, (“Marshall”) (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403. 
This rule does not apply to allegations expressing mere conclusions of law, or
allegations contradicted by the exhibits to the complaint or by matters of
which judicial notice may be taken.  Vance v. Villa Park Mobilehome
Estates, (“Vance”) (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 698, 709. 
            For all
demurrers filed after January 1, 2016, the demurring party must meet and confer
in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading for the purpose
of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer.  CCP §430.31(a).  As part of
the meet and confer process, the demurring party must identify all of the
specific causes of action that it believes are subject to demurrer and provide
legal support for the claimed deficiencies.  CCP §430.31(a)(1).  The
party who filed the pleading must in turn provide legal support for its
position that the pleading is legally sufficient or, in the alternative, how
the complaint, cross-complaint, or answer could be amended to cure any legal
insufficiency.  Id.  The demurring party is responsible for
filing and serving a declaration that the meet and confer requirement has been
met.  CCP §430.31(a)(3).
            “[A]
demurrer based on a statute of limitations will not lie where the action may
be, but is not necessarily, barred. [Citation.] In order for the bar of the
statute of limitations to be raised by demurrer, the defect must clearly and
affirmatively appear on the face of the complaint; it is not enough that the
complaint shows that the action may be barred.” State ex rel. Metz v. CCC
Information Services, Inc., (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 402, 413.
            If a demurrer is
sustained, the court may grant leave to amend the pleading upon any terms as
may be just and shall fix the time within which the amendment or amended
pleading shall be filed.  CCP §472a(c). 
However, in response to a demurrer and prior to the case being at issue,
a complaint or cross-complaint shall not be amended more than three times,
absent an offer to the trial court as to such additional facts to be pleaded
that there is a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured to state a cause
of action.  CCP §430.41(e)(1).
 
            C.
Statement of Facts[1]
            1.
The Court’s Judgment
            On
August 31, 2016, DHCS received the Medi-Cal change of ownership applications
for Midway and Bell.  RJN Ex. 1, p.
10.  It approved the applications
retroactive to that August 31, 2016 date on October 27, 2017.  RJN Ex. 1, p. 10.  
            During
DHCS’ audit of Midway and PCH, it concluded that PCH had received payment for
5,184 Medi-Cal claims fulfilled at Midway and Bell when they were suspended,
unenrolled, and ineligible.  RJN Ex. 1,
p. 10.  DHCS demanded recovery of $1,791,322.75
in overpayment for these inappropriate billing practices.  RJN Ex. 1, pp. 10-11.  An administrative hearing upheld the DHCS’
actions.  RJN Ex. 1, p. 11.  
            This
court’s trial decision on the Petition ruled that DHCS had conflated the
definitions of a “provider” of pharmacy services and a “physical
location.”  RJN Ex. 1, p. 22.  PCH had always billed at Midway and Bell on
its own behalf, not on behalf of a suspended provider.  RJN Ex. 1, p. 22.  
            DHCS
was authorized to deny a claim for pharmaceuticals dispensed at a new location
before an application for that location had been submitted.  RJN Ex. 1, p. 23.  However, W&I Code section 14043.26(k) allows
DHCS to exercise discretion whether it should deny PCH’s submission of bills
prior to August 31, 2016.  RJN Ex. 1, pp.
25.  DHCS’ December 2021 decision instead
assumed that it was required to recover the overpayments under 22 CCR section
51488.1.  RJN Ex. 1, p. 25.  
            Under
22 CCR section 51488.1(b), where services have been rendered, mitigating or
ameliorating facts and circumstances shall be considered.  RJN Ex. 1, p. 28.  This discretion includes the ability to
consider the claims false under 22 CCR section 51488.1(a)(7) because DHCS did
not know the service was not rendered at that location.  RJN Ex. 1, p. 27.  However, this falsity did not obviate the
need to exercise discretion.  RJN Ex. 1,
p. 27.  
            In
remanding the matter, the court directed DHCS to exercise its discretion under W&I
Code section 14043.26(k) and consider mitigating facts under 22 CCR section
51488.1(b) as to improper billing.  RJN
Ex. 1, p. 33.  
 
            2.
The Return
In its Return dated August 29, 2023, DHCS asserted that it
had complied with the writ by considering the mitigating facts in the record as
they relate to the inappropriate billing issue raised in the Petition.  RJN
Ex. 2.  The Return attached the Chief ALJ’s final
decision after remand.  RJN Ex. 2, Ex. A.
 
D. Analysis
            DHCS demurs to Yoo’s
Supplemental Petition and alternatively moves to strike Paragraphs 4-7.
 
            1.
Meet and Confer
            The
parties e-mailed each other as to the issues raised in this demurrer in
September and October 2023.  Gunn Decl.,
¶2.  The parties disputed whether a
supplemental petition was the appropriate method to raise the claims therein.  Gunn Decl., ¶2.  Yoo refused to withdraw the Supplemental Petition
and file a new petition.  Gunn Decl.,
¶3.  DHCS has met its meet and confer
obligations.
 
            2.
Supplemental Petitions
            Once
a judgment has been entered, the trial court loses its unrestricted power to
change the judgment.  Graven v. Crout,
(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 779, 782.  
A court issuing a writ of mandate retains jurisdiction to
make any order necessary to its enforcement. 
CCP §§ 1097, 1105; County of lnyo v. City of Los Angeles, (“County
of Inyo”) (1977)  71 Cal.App.3d 185,
205; see also, Professional Engineers in Cal. Govt. v. State
Personnel Bd., (1980) 114 Cal.App.3d 101, 109.  This authority is codified in CCP section
1097, which provides in part that when a peremptory writ has issued and is
disobeyed, the court “may make any orders necessary and proper for the complete
enforcement of the writ.”  This
enforcement power is also an inherent power of the court.  Kings v. Woods, (1983) 144 Cal. App.3d
571, 578.  Thus, where the writ remands
the matter to an agency with directions to proceed in a certain manner, and the
agency’s return states that the court’s mandate has been carried out, a
petitioner may challenge the validity of that claim.  CCP §1097. 

A supplemental petition is
not directly authorized in the CCP.  A supplemental complaint – defined as
a complaint alleging material facts occurring after an earlier complaint was
filed – is specifically authorized.  CCP §464(a).  The CCP provisions
concerning complaints constitute the rules of practice for mandamus.  CCP
§1109.  Hence, the requirements of CCP section 464 with respect to a
supplemental complaint apply to a supplemental petition for mandamus.  CCP section 464(a) expressly
requires a motion to file a supplemental complaint, and there is case authority
for a motion for leave to file a supplemental petition for mandamus.  See
Giannini Controls Corp. v. Superior Court, (1966) 240 Cal.App.2d 142,
151 (supplemental petition sought by noticed motion should have been
permitted).   There is authority that the
motion for leave to file a supplemental petition may be either oral or
written.  City of
Carmel-by-The-Sea v. Board of Supervisors, (“Carmel-by-the-Sea”)
(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 964, 971.
A supplemental petition is permitted in mandamus only after
the mandated party has filed a return advising the court and parties of its
compliance.  Pollak v. State Personnel
Board, (“Pollak”) (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 1394-95
(supplemental petition challenged board’s order for reduced penalty imposed
after remand); Carmel-by-The-Sea, supra, 137 Cal.App.3d at 971
(petition may challenge a return in several ways, including a supplemental
petition); Kensington University v. Council for Private Postsecondary, etc.
Education, (“Kensington”) (1997) 62 Cal.App.4th 27, 39
(supplemental petition considered only after administrative body’s final
decision).  
The court’s review of a return is limited to determining
whether the agency cured the deficiencies identified in the writ.  Nat’l Parks & Conservation Ass’n v.
County of Riverside, (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1341, 1351-52.  The court must resolve any doubts in favor of
the agency’s finding and decision.  Id.  The failure to challenge the scope of writ
arising from facts in existence before judgment are precludes a challenge in
post-judgment proceedings concerning compliance with the writ.  Ballona Wetlands Land Trust v. City of Los
Angeles, (“Ballona Wetlands”) (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 455,
481.  The court may not consider any
newly asserted challenges arising from the same material facts in existence at
the time of the prior judgment because consideration of those issues that were,
or could have been, raised in the litigation leading to the return.  See Town
of Atherton v. Cal. High-Speed Rail Auth., (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th
314, 354 (holding that petitioner’s argument in second lawsuit regarding
validity of alternatives analysis in a revised EIR was barred by collateral
estoppel because the court had already rejected petitioner’s same argument in
the first case).
The existence of a return is a condition precedent to the
three means of challenging the agency’s action. 
“Where, as here, the writ remands the matter...and the return states
that the court’s mandate has been carried out, the petitioner may challenge the
validity of that claim” by a new petition, a supplemental petition, or a motion
to compel compliance.  Carmel-by-the-Sea,
supra, 137 Cal.App.3d at 971.  To
conclude that a petitioner may challenge anything other than the return’s
compliance with the judgment and writ would raise serious issues about the
judgment’s finality and scope of the writ. 
See Graven v. Crout, supra, 163 Cal.App.3d at 782; Ballona
Wetlands, supra, 201 Cal.App.4th at 481.  
 
3. Whether Yoo’s Supplemental Petition is Proper
In the writ, this court directed DHCS to exercise its
discretion under W&I Code section 14043.26(k) and consider mitigating facts
under 22 CCR section 51488.1(b) as to improper billing.  RJN Ex. 1, p. 33.  In August 2023, DHCS asserted via the Return
that it had considered the mitigating facts in the record as they relate to the
inappropriate billing issue.  RJN Ex.
2.  The Remand Decision discussed four potential
mitigating factors but found that none of them merited an adjustment to the
DHCS’ inappropriate billing practice audit finding.  Supp. Pet., ¶3, Ex. A.
Yoo asserts that his Supplemental Petition is an appropriate
method to challenge the Remand Decision, relying on Carmel-by-the-Sea, which
held that, when a writ remands a matter to the administrative body with
directions to proceed in a certain manner, and the return states that the
court's mandate has been carried out, the petitioner may challenge the validity
of that claim via supplemental petition. 
137 Cal. App. 3d at 971-72. Yoo asserts this is what the Supplemental
Petition does.  It alleges that the Remand
Decision is invalid because the Chief ALJ’s decision was arbitrary and
capricious.  Supp. Pet., ¶4.  Opp. at 4.
While the issue is not free from doubt, and one can argue
that DHCS’s compliance with the writ and the adequacy of the Chief ALJ’s
decision after remand are two separate issues, Yoo’s Supplemental Petition is
permissible.  It is the validity of the
return that is at issue in a supplemental petition.  See Carmel-by-the-Sea, supra,
137 Cal. App. 3d at 971-72.  DHCS’s Return
is based on the Chief ALJ’s decision.  The
court’s writ required DHCS to consider mitigating facts when issuing the Remand
Decision.  RJN Ex. 1, p. 33.  Although Yoo asserts that she failed to do so
(Supp. Pet., ¶5), the Remand Decision clearly includes discussion of four mitigating
factors: Yoo’s contacts with his attorney, his mistaken belief about his licensing
by the Board, his belief that closing would occur earlier than it actually
occurred, and his general effort to comply with the law.  Supp. Pet., ¶3, Ex. A.  
            The
Supplemental Petition alleges that the Chief ALJ erred because she exceeded her
authority, the administrative record does not support her findings, and her decision
enables Medi-Cal to pay nothing for products dispensed to its beneficiaries.  Supp. Pet., ¶¶ 4-7.  These are all challenges to the merits of the
Chief ALJ’s Remand Decision.  Opp. at 3.  An agency’s abuse of discretion on remand still
concerns the validity of the return.  The
matter would be no different if Yoo had made a motion to compel compliance with
the writ based on the Chief ALJ’s abuse of discretion, which would be
permissible.  The demurrer to the
Supplemental Petition is overruled.[2]
 
            E.
Conclusion
            The
demurrer to the Supplemental Petition is overruled and the motion to strike is
denied.  DCHS has already answered.
