And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the court hearing. The tenant failed to lodge a courtesy copy of his opposition, violating the Presiding Judge's order. As a result, the tenant's counsel is admonished to provide courtesy copies in all future filings. The judge has also reviewed the declaration of Sean Bral, which labels two paragraphs as Paragraph 7, and found that the late fees total 10% of the total owed, even if it exceeds $200 per month. The judge has sustained the landlord's evidentiary objections to Exhibit 2 of the Esfandi declaration, but overruled the objections for lines 23-24. The court holiday on Monday, February 12, 2024, has also been noted.
