            [1] DHCS
requests judicial notice of the court’s judgment granting the Petition (RJN Ex.
1) and DHCS’s Return to the Writ of Mandate (RJN Ex. 2).  The court need not judicially notice either
document; it is always free to review earlier filings in the current action.


[2] DHCS
moves to strike Paragraphs 4-7 of the Supplemental Petition as legally
improper.  Mot. at 11-12.  The motion is made on the same basis as the
demurrer – it is improper to challenge the Chief ALJ’s Remand Decision in a
Supplemental Petition – and is denied for the same reasons.
