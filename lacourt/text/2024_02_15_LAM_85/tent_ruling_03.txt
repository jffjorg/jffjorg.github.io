 Case Number:  23STCV27583    Hearing Date:   February 15, 2024    Dept:  85 
Pacific Walnut Center v.
Joseph Esfandi, 23STCV27583
Tentative decision on application
for right to attach order: granted




 
            
Plaintiff Pacific Walnut Center (“Landlord”) applies for a right
to attach order against Defendant Joseph Esfandi (“Tenant”) in the amount of $261,395.

            The
court has read and considered the moving papers and opposition,[1]
and reply, and renders the following tentative decision.
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            Landlord
filed its Complaint on November 7, 2023, alleging breach of lease in pertinent
part as follows. 
            On
July 1, 2017, Landlord and Tenant entered a lease (“Lease”) for 784 East
Twelfth Street, Los Angeles, CA 90021 (“Premises”).  On June 1, 2019, the parties entered into an
Amendment to the Lease (“First Amendment”) extending the term for two years
from June 2019 to May 2021.  Rent during
this extension was $8,000 per month.  Another
amendment on June 8, 2020 (“Second Amendment”) reduced the rent to $4,000 per
month for the period of April, May, and June 2020.  
            Tenant
continued to occupy the Premises after the Lease expired on June 1, 2021.  He has been a holdover tenant since.  Paragraph 26 of the Lease increased the base
rent for this period to 150% of its previous amount, or an additional $4,000
per month.
            Tenant
did not pay the rent owed in July 2020. 
Tenant only paid $6,000 per month in rent from August 2020 thereafter,
$2,000 less than the base rent owed before the term expired.  Tenant owes $86,000 in unpaid base rent based
on the $8,000 rental rate, $116,000 based on the additional $4,000 rent as a
holdover tenant from June 2021 thereafter, and $20,200 in late fees under
paragraph 13.4 of the Lease.  Damages
total $222,200.
            Landlord
seeks compensatory damages totaling $222,200, interest thereon, and attorney’s
fees and costs. 
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            No
proof of service is on file for the Complaint and Summons.  On January 16, 2024, Tenant filed an Answer.
 
            B.
Applicable Law
            Attachment
is a prejudgment remedy providing for the seizure of one or more of the
defendant’s assets to aid in the collection of a money demand pending the
outcome of the trial of the action.  See
Whitehouse v. Six Corporation, (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 527, 533.  In 1972, and in a 1977 comprehensive
revision, the Legislature enacted attachment legislation (CCP §481.010 et
seq.) that meets the due process requirements set forth in Randone v.
Appellate Department, (1971) 5 Cal.3d 536. 
See Western Steel & Ship Repair v. RMI, (12986) 176
Cal.App.3d 1108, 1115.  As the attachment
statutes are purely the creation of the Legislature, they are strictly
construed.  Vershbow v. Reiner,
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 879, 882.




            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
CCP §483.010(a).  A claim is
“readily ascertainable” where the amount due may be clearly ascertained from
the contract and calculated by evidence; the fact that damages are unliquidated
is not determinative.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th
537, 540-41 (attachment appropriate for claim based on rent calculation for
lease of commercial equipment).
            All
property within California of a corporation, association, or partnership is
subject to attachment if there is a method of levy for the property.  CCP §487.010(a), (b).  While a trustee is a natural person, a trust
is not.  Therefore, a trust’s property is
subject to attachment on the same basis as a corporation or partnership.  Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn &
Rossi v. Wilson, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d at 4.
            If
the action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a commercial claim which arises out of the defendant’s conduct
of a trade, business, or profession.  CCP
§483.010(c).  Consumer transactions
cannot form a basis for attachment.   CCP
§483.010(c); Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson,
(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 (action involving trust property was a commercial,
not a consumer, transaction).
            The
plaintiff may apply for a right to attach order by noticing a hearing for the
order and serving the defendant with summons and complaint, notice of the
application, and supporting papers any time after filing the complaint.  CCP §484.010. 
Notice of the application must be given pursuant to CCP section 1005,
sixteen court days before the hearing.  See
ibid.
            The
notice of the application and the application may be made on Judicial Council
forms (Optional Forms AT-105, 115).  The
application must be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the
facts presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the
attachment is based.  CCP §484.030.  
            Where
the defendant is a corporation, a general reference to “all corporate property
which is subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (a) of Code of Civil
Procedure Section 487.010” is sufficient. 
CCP §484.020(e).  Where the
defendant is a partnership or other unincorporated association, a reference to
“all property of the partnership or other unincorporated association which is
subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure
Section 487.010” is sufficient.  CCP
§484.020(e).  A specific description of
property is not required for corporations and partnerships as they generally
have no exempt property.  Bank of
America v. Salinas Nissan, Inc., (“Bank of America”) (1989) 207
Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            Where
the defendant is a natural person, the description of the property must be
reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify the specific property
sought to be attached.  CCP §484.020(e).  Although the property must be specifically
described, the plaintiff may target for attachment everything the individual
defendant owns.  Bank of America v.
Salinas Nissan, Inc., (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            A
defendant who opposes issuance of the order must file and serve a notice of
opposition and supporting affidavit as required by CCP section 484.060 not
later than five court days prior to the date set for hearing.  CCP §484.050(e).  The notice of opposition may be made on a
Judicial Council form (Optional Form AT-155). 

            The
plaintiff may file and serve a reply two court days prior to the date set for
the hearing.  CCP §484.060(c). 
            At
the hearing, the court determines whether the plaintiff should receive a right
to attach order and whether any property which the plaintiff seeks to attach is
exempt from attachment.  The defendant
may appear the hearing.  CCP
§484.050(h).  The court generally will
evaluate the attachment application based solely on the pleadings and
supporting affidavits without taking additional evidence.  Bank of America, supra, 207
Cal.App.3d at 273. A verified complaint may be used in lieu of or in addition
to an affidavit if it states evidentiary facts. 
CCP §482.040.  The plaintiff has the
burden of proof, and the court is not required to accept as true any affidavit
even if it is undisputed.  See Bank
of America, supra, at 271, 273.



            The
court may issue a right to attach order (Optional Form AT-120) if the plaintiff
shows all of the following: (1) the claim on which the attachment is based is
one on which an attachment may be issued (CCP §484.090(a)(1)); (2) the
plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim (CCP
§484.090(a)(2)); (3) attachment is sought for no purpose other than the
recovery on the subject claim (CCP §484.090(a)(3); and (4) the amount to be
secured by the attachment is greater than zero (CCP §484.090(a)(4)). 
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim. 
CCP §481.190.  In determining this
issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros.
Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474,
1484.  The court does not determine
whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial
and is not affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
            Except
in unlawful detainer actions, the amount to be secured by the attachment is the
sum of (1) the amount of the defendant’s indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff,
and (2) any additional amount included by the court for estimate of costs and
any allowable attorneys’ fees under CCP section 482.110.  CCP §483.015(a); Goldstein v. Barak
Construction, (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 845, 852.  This amount must be reduced by the sum of (1)
the amount of indebtedness that the defendant has in a money judgment against plaintiff,
(2) the amount claimed in a cross-complaint or affirmative defense and shown
would be subject to attachment against the plaintiff, and (3) the value of any
security interest held by the plaintiff in the defendant’s property, together
with the amount by which the acts of the plaintiff (or a prior holder of the
security interest) have decreased that security interest’s value.  CCP §483.015(b).  A defendant claiming that the amount to be
secured should be reduced because of a cross-claim or affirmative defense must
make a prima facie showing that the claim would result in an attachment
against the plaintiff.
            Before
the issuance of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff is required to file an
undertaking to pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any
wrongful attachment by the plaintiff in the action.  CCP §489.210. 
The undertaking ordinarily is $10,000. CCP §489.220.  If the defendant objects, the court may
increase the amount of undertaking to the amount determined as the probable
recovery for wrongful attachment.  CCP
§489.220.  The court also has inherent
authority to increase the amount of the undertaking sua sponte.  North Hollywood Marble Co. v. Superior
Court, (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 683, 691.
 
            C. Statement of Facts
            1.
Landlord’s Evidence
            On
July 1, 2017, Landlord and Tenant entered a Lease for the Premises.  Bral Decl., ¶3, Ex. A.  The Lease was titled as a “Standard
Industrial/Commercial” lease and described the Premises as a “single commercial
unit.”  Bral Decl., ¶14, Ex. A,
§1.2(a).  Tenant agreed to use the
Premises for wholesale women’s clothing. 
Bral Decl., ¶14, Ex. A, §1.7.
            Tenant
agreed under section 13.4 that any rent not paid within five days of its due
date accrues a late fee that is the greater of $100 and 10% of the payment
owed.  Bral Decl., ¶3, Ex. A.  Paragraph 26 states that Tenant has no right
to retain possession of the Premises after the Lease expires.  Bral Decl., ¶3, Ex. A.  If he does, the Base Rent would be 150% of
whatever it last was under the Lease. 
Bral Decl., ¶3, Ex. A.  
            Paragraph
46 of the Lease requires that any amendment to the Lease must be in writing and
signed by both parties.  Bral Decl., ¶3,
Ex. A.  
            On
June 1, 2019, Landlord and Tenant entered the First Amendment, extending the
term of the Lease for two years from June 2019 to May 2021.  Bral Decl., ¶4, Ex. A.  Rent during this period was set at $8,000 per
month.  Bral Decl., ¶4, Ex. A.  A Second Amendment, on June 8, 2020, reduced
the rent to $4,000 per month for period of April, May, and June 2020.  Bral Decl., ¶4, Ex. A.
              Tenant continued to occupy the Premises after
the Lease expired on June 1, 2021.  Bral
Decl., ¶5.  He has been a holdover tenant
since that date.  Bral Decl., ¶5.  
            Landlord’s
ledger shows Tenant did not pay the rent owed in July 2020.  Bral Decl., ¶¶ 6, 11, Ex. B.  When Tenant asserted after commencement of
this action that he paid it, Landlord told him it would remove this amount from
the outstanding balance if Tenant provided proof.  Bral Decl., ¶6, n.1.  Tenant has not provided proof of such payment.  Bral Decl., ¶6, n.1.  
            Tenant
also only paid $6,000 rent per month beginning in August 2020, $2,000 less than
the base rent owed.  Bral Decl., ¶¶ 6,
11, Ex. B.  The unpaid base rent from
August 2020 through January 2024 totals $82,000.  Bral Decl., ¶¶ 6, 11, Ex. B.  When combined with the unpaid rent of $8,000
for July 2020, Tenant owes $90,000 through the Lease term.  Bral Decl., ¶¶ 6, 11, Ex. B.  
            As
a holdover tenant beginning in June 2021, the rent was increased by
$4,000.  Bral Decl., ¶¶ 7, 11, Ex. B.  There is $124,000 in unpaid rent from June
2021 to January 2024.  Bral Decl., ¶¶ 7, 11,
Ex. B.  
            Tenant
also owes late fees of 10%, or $21,400.  Bral
Decl., ¶¶ 7, 11, Ex. B.[2]  The total amount owed under the Lease is $90,000
+ $124,000 + $21,400 = $235,400.  Bral
Decl., ¶10.
            Paragraph
31 of the Lease entitles Landlord to attorney’s fees and costs incurred to
enforce the Lease.  Bral Decl., ¶12, Ex.
A.  Landlord’s counsel charges a $600
hourly rate, has already spent 12.5 hours on this action, and expects to spend
another 30 hours.  Kohan Decl., ¶¶
5-7.  The estimated attorney’s fees total
$25,500 ($600 x 12.5 = $7,500) + ($600 x 30=$18,000) ($18,000 +$7500= $25,500).  Kohan Decl., ¶7.  Landlord has also paid a $435 filing fee for
the Complaint and a $60 filing fee for this application.  Kohan Decl., ¶9.
 
            2.
Tenant’s Evidence[3]
            Because
of Tenant’s relationship with Landlord’s previous representative, a “Mr. Brai”
(“Brai”), their dealings were more informal than most landlord-tenant dealings.  Esfandi Decl., ¶2.  Only some amendments to the Lease were ever
in writing.  Esfandi Decl., ¶3.
            Because
of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Second Amendment reduced the rent to $4,000 per
month for the period of April, May, and June 2020.  Esfandi Decl., ¶4, Ex. 1.  Sometime after, Tenant met with Brai and
another tenant, Yi Zhou of Reebees Fashion, Inc. (“Zhou”), to discuss
continuing rent reductions and they agreed to $6000 a month.  Esfandi Decl., ¶5.  Tenant has since paid this $6,000 timely with
no objection from Brai.  Esfandi Decl., ¶6,
Exs. 2-3.
            On
January 23, 2024, Landlord emailed Tenant’s counsel notice of this application
and all moving papers.  Linzer Decl., ¶2,
Ex. A.  Landlord never served Tenant by
mail.  Linzer Decl., ¶3.
 
            3.
Reply Evidence
            Sean
Bral and his deceased father, Said Bral, have owned and/or managed several
properties together until Said Bral’s passing in July 2021.  Reply Bral Decl., ¶3.  Said Bral’s practice was to prepare a
document reflecting any change in tenant relations.  Reply Bral Decl., ¶4.  This was true for the First and Second
Amendments with Tenant.  Reply Bral
Decl., ¶5.  In their 20 year relationship,
Said Bral never agreed to a rent reduction that was not in writing and he
always discussed this issues with his son. 
Reply Bral Decl., ¶5.  Prior to
this lawsuit, Tenant never claimed to Sean Bral that Said Bral had agreed to a
rent reduction to $600.  Reply Bral
Decl., ¶6.
 
            D. Analysis
            Landlord
applies for a right to attach order against Defendant Tenant
in the amount of $261,395, including $495 in costs and $25,500 in attorney’s
fees.
 
            1. Insufficient Notice
            Written notice of a notice of application
and hearing for writ of attachment shall be served and filed at least 16 court
days before the hearing.  CCP §§
1005(a)(1), (b).  If the notice is served
by mail, the required 16-day notice before the hearing shall be increased by
five calendar days if the place of mailing and the place of address are within
the State of California.  CCP §1005(b).
            Landlord served Tenant with this
application by email on January 23, 2024. 
Linzer Decl., ¶¶ 2-3, Ex. A. 
Tenant asserts that CCP section 482.070, 684.040, and 684.120 required
service by mail, not email.  Opp. at
1.  CCP sections 484.040 and 1005(b) then
required service by January 18, 2024 to reflect the five-day extension for service
by mail.  Opp. at 1-2.
            CCP section 684.040 only applies to
service under that article, which concerns service on an attorney of a judgment
creditor or debtor.  CCP section 684.120
describes service by mail of a writ, notice, order, or other paper under that
title, which is the “Enforcement of Judgments Law.”  CCP §680.010.  These statutes concern judgments and do not
apply to an application for a right to attach order.
            CCP section 482.070 states that
legal process required or permitted to be served under Attachment Law may be
served personally or by mail.  CCP §482.070(a)(1).  Legal process is a reference to service of
the moving papers for attachment.  CCP
§482.070(b).  Service personally or by
mail under CCP section 482.070 does not describe the exclusive means of
service.  CCP section 1010.6 expressly
authorizes electronic service of documents that otherwise may be served by mail
so long as in compliance with Judicial Council rules.  CCP §1010.6(a), (3)(A), (h).  The Judicial Council’s rule states that where
a document may be served by mail, it may be served electronically.  CRC 2.251. 
Express consent is required, but a party is deemed to consent to
electronic service by using the court’s electronic filing system.  CRC 2.251(b)(1)(B).  The Presiding Judge’s First Amended Order re:
Electronic Filing requires that trial court records must be electronically
filed.  Tenant answered on January 16,
2024 and is subject to electronic service.  Electronic service extends the deadline to
respond by two court days.  CCP 1010.6(a)(3)(B).

            CCP section 484.040 provides that a
writ of attachment may not issue unless the defendant has been served with summons
and complaint and the moving papers pursuant to CCP section 1005(b).   CCP
section 1005(b) provides for service of attachment moving papers and extends
the 16-day period by two days for service “providing for overnight delivery”.   CCP §1005(b).
            Landlord was permitted to
electronically serve the moving papers and was required to do so 16 court days,
plus two additional days for electronic service, before the hearing.  Landlord’s January 23, 2024 electronic
service was exactly 16 court days before the February 15, 2024 hearing.[4]  Therefore,
it was two days late.  However, Tenant shows
no prejudice.  He was required to file
and serve any opposition no later than five court days before the hearing date.  CCP §§ 484.050(e); 1005(b).  He instead filed and served the opposition on
February 9, only three court days before the hearing.  Tenant’s untimely opposition will be
considered, but so will Landlord’s moving papers.
 
            2.
A Claim Based on a
Contract and on Which Attachment May Be Based
            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
CCP §483.010(a).
            Landlord
claims $235,400 in damages, plus attorney’s fees and costs, for breach of the
Lease and Amendments thereto.  Bral
Decl., ¶¶ 3, 10-11, Ex. A.  Landlord has a
contract claim on which to base
attachment.
 
            3. An Amount Due That is Fixed
and Readily Ascertainable 
            A
claim is “readily ascertainable” where the damages may be readily ascertained by
reference to the contract and the basis of the calculation appears to be
reasonable and definite.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 537,
540-41.  The fact that the damages are
unliquidated is not determinative.  Id.  But the contract must furnish a standard by
which the amount may be ascertained and there must be a basis by which the
damages can be determined by proof.  Id.
(citations omitted).
 
            a.
Unpaid Rent and Late Charges
            Under
the First Amendment, the rent from June 2019 to May 2021 was $8,000 per
month.  Bral Decl., ¶4, Ex. A.  Landlord’s ledger shows Tenant did not pay any
rent owed in July 2020 and underpaid by $2,000 per month through the end of the
Lease.  Bral Decl., ¶¶ 6, 11, Ex. B.  Unpaid base rent from August 2020 through
January 2024 totals $82,000.  Bral Decl.,
¶¶ 6, 11, Ex. B.  When combined with
$8,000 for July 2020, Tenant owes $90,000. 
Bral Decl., ¶¶ 6, 11, Ex. B.  
            The
Lease also increased the monthly rent by 50%, or an additional $4,000, from
June 2021, the month after the Lease expired. 
Bral Decl., ¶¶ 3, 7, 11, Exs. A-B. 
Landlord’s ledger shows this adds $124,000 in unpaid rent from June 2021
to January 2024.  Bral Decl., ¶¶ 7, 11,
Ex. B.  
            Under
section 13.4 of the Lease, any rent not paid within five days of its due date accrues
a late fee that is the greater of $100 and 10% of the payment owed.  Bral Decl., ¶3, Ex. A.  Based on unpaid rent of $90,000 + $124,000 =
$214,000, Landlord asserts Tenant owes late fees of 10%, or $21,400.  Bral Decl., ¶¶ 7, 11, Ex. B.
            Tenant
asserts that Landlord ignores an August 2020 amendment to the Lease decreasing
his monthly rent to $6,000, which he has paid. 
Esfandi Decl., ¶5, Ex. 3.  Because
of Tenant’s relationship with Landlord’s father, only some amendments to the
Lease were made in writing.  Esfandi
Decl., ¶3.  Tenant further notes that Sean
Brai did not object to his $6,000 rent payment for over three years.  Esfandi Decl., ¶6.
Assuming arguendo that Said Brai and Tenant did enter
an oral amendment, Paragraph 46 of the Lease requires that amendment to be in
writing and signed by both parties in interest at the time of such an
amendment.  Bral Decl., ¶3, Ex. A.  An oral amendment violates the parties’
agreement and probably the statute of frauds. 
Civil Code §1624.  Nor does Tenant
cite any authority that a landlord waives the right to pursue unpaid rent by
accepting partial payment.  Landlord
points out that Paragraphs 24 and 4.3 of the Lease expressly permit Landlord to
accept less than full rent without waiving the right to balance due.  Reply at 5.
            Tenant
asserts that he should not be considered a holdover tenant subject to greater
rent because of the oral amendment.  Opp.
at 2.  Any oral amendment is irrelevant
to whether Tenant was a holdover tenant. 
The purported oral amendment did not extend the Lease term beyond June
2021, after which Tenant was subject to the 150% holdover rate.  Bral Decl., ¶3, Ex. A.  
            The
total amount owed based on the Lease is $90,000 + $124,000 + $21,400 =
$235,400.  Bral Decl., ¶10.
 
            b.
Attorney’s Fees
            Paragraph
31 of the Lease also entitled Landlord to attorney’s fees and costs incurred to
enforce the Lease.  Bral Decl., ¶12, Ex.
A.  Counsel has calculated that
anticipated attorney’s fees total $7,500 + $18,000 = $25,500.  Kohan Decl., ¶7.  Landlord has also paid a $435 filing fee for
the Complaint and a $60 filing fee for this application.  Kohan Decl., ¶9.
 
            c.
Conclusion
            $235,400
+ $25,500 + $495 = $261,395 in damages are ascertainable.
 
            4. Probability of Success
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim. 
CCP §481.190.  In determining this
issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros.
Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474,
1484.  The court does not determine
whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial
and is not affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
            On
July 1, 2017, Landlord and Tenant entered a Lease for the Premises.  Bral Decl., ¶3, Ex. A.  They later entered two Amendments, extending
the Lease term to May 2021 and setting the rent for that period.  Bral Decl., ¶4, Ex. A.  The Lease also provided for an increase in
rent to 150% of its previous level if Tenant remained in possession beyond the
Lease’s term.  Bral Decl., ¶3, Ex.
A.  
            The
ledger shows that since July 2020, Tenant has not paid all rent owed as it
became due.  Bral Decl., ¶¶ 6-7, 11, Ex.
B.  Although Tenant asserts that an oral
amendment reduced the rent to the $6,000 he then paid, the Lease prohibits any
oral amendment thereto.  See supra.  Because Tenant remains in possession of the
Premises, rent continues to accrue at a higher rate than during the term of the
Lease.  Bral Decl., ¶¶ 7, 11, Ex. B.  
            Landlord
has demonstrated a probability of success on the merits.
 
            5.
Attachment Based on Commercial Claim
            If
the action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a commercial claim which arises out of the defendant’s conduct
of a trade, business, or profession.  CCP
§483.010(c).  Consumer transactions
cannot form a basis for attachment.   CCP
§483.010(c); Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson, (“Kadison”)
(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 (action involving trust property was a commercial,
not a consumer, transaction).
            These terms “trade,”
“business,” and “profession” encompass almost any activity engaged in for
profit with “frequency and continuity.”  Advance
Transformer Co. v. Superior Court, (1974) 44 Cal.App.3d 127, 139. 
The purpose of the attachment statutes is to confine attachment to commercial
situations and prohibit their use in consumer transactions.  Kadison, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d at
4.
            The Lease was
titled as a “Standard Industrial/Commercial” lease and described the Premises
as a “single commercial unit.”  Bral
Decl., ¶14, Ex. A, §1.2(a).  Tenant
agreed to use the Premises for wholesale women’s clothing.  Bral Decl., ¶14, Ex. A, §1.7.  The
claim against Tenant is a commercial claim.
            
            6.
Description of Property to be Attached
            Where
the defendant is a natural person, the description of the property must be
reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify the specific property
sought to be attached.  CCP §484.020(e).  Although the property must be specifically
described, the plaintiff may target for attachment everything the individual
defendant owns.  Bank of America v.
Salinas Nissan, Inc., (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268. The requirement of
specificity avoids unnecessary hearings where an individual defendant is
willing to concede that the described property is subject to attachment.  Ibid. 
A general list of categories - e.g., “real property, personal
property, equipment, motor vehicles, chattel paper, negotiable and other
instruments, securities, deposit accounts, safe-deposit boxes, accounts
receivable, general intangibles, property subject to pending actions, final money
judgments, and personal property in decedents’ estates” – is sufficient.  Ibid. 
            Landlord
seeks to attach Tenant’s interest in real property except for leasehold estates
with unexpired terms of less than one year; chattel paper, accounts receivable,
and general intangibles arising out of a trade, business, or profession, except
for individual claims with a principal balance of less than $150; final money
judgments arising from the same; equipment; farm products; inventory; money on
the premises where a trade, business, or profession is conducted by the
defendant, plus money located elsewhere beyond the first collective $1,000; negotiable
documents of title; instruments; securities; minerals to be extracted; and
community property that would be subject to enforcement of the judgment
obtained in this action.  The description
of attachable property is
adequate.
 
7. Attachment Sought for a Proper Purpose 
            Attachment
must not be sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon
which attachment is based.  CCP §484.090(a)(3).  Landlord seeks attachment for a proper
purpose.
 
            8.
Undertaking
            Before
issuance of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff shall file an undertaking to
pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any wrongful
attachment by the plaintiff in the action. 
CCO §489.210.
            Tenant
requests the court to require Landlord to post a $90,000 bond to reflect the proper
$90,000 amount for a right to attach order. 
Opp. at 3-4.  As discussed above,
the attachable amount is $261,395.  In
any case, the damages for wrongful attachment do not equal the amount
attached.  Rather, those damages concern
the lost use of attached property and the attorney’s fees necessary to set
aside the attachment.  The request to
increase the undertaking is denied.
 
            E. Conclusion
            The
application for a right to attach order is granted against Tenant for $261,395.  No right to attach order shall issue until
Landlord posts a $10,000 undertaking.
