And here is a brief English-language summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, California Department of Tax and Fee Administration, has filed an unopposed motion to transfer the case from the East District to the Central District. The defendant claims that the Attorney General of California does not have an office in Pomona, where the case was originally filed, but does have an office in Los Angeles. The judge grants the motion, citing California Revenue and Taxation Code section 6933, which allows for the transfer of venue to a district where the Attorney General has an office. The case will be reassigned to the Central District, and the moving party will give notice.
