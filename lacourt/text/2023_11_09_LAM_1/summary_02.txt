And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendants' motion for coordination of the two cases: 22STCV11897 and 22TRCV00996. The motion relies on Code of Civil Procedure section 403 and California Rules of Court, rule 3.500 to argue that the two cases should be coordinated and analyzed based on the factors governing coordination. However, the Judge finds that the motion is procedurally defective because coordination is only applicable between courts, not between different departments within the same court. The Judge also notes that the Defendants failed to comply with the California Rules of Court and therefore did not properly bring a Notice of Related Case before the appropriate judicial officer. As a result, the Judge orders the Defendants to file a new Notice of Related Case with accurate information and in full compliance with the California Rules of Court.
