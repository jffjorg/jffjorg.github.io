Related and Request for Transfer to West District Courthouse [Dept N.]

Motion to Deem Cases Related and Request for Transfer to West District
Courthouse [Dept N.] is DENIED.  Counsel
for Shadanloo to give notice.
Background
of BC482598 Shadanloo v. SBE Entertainment 
 
On April 11, 2012, Samsum
Shadanloo filed BC482598 against Defendant SBE Entertainment Group, LLC. On
April 13, 2012, Shadanloo filed a First Amended Complaint asserting causes of
action for: (1) assault; (2) battery; (3) intentional infliction of emotional
distress; (4) premises liability; (5) negligent investigation; and (6)
negligent infliction of emotional distress. The FAC alleged Shadanloo was a
patron of a nightclub owned and operated by Defendant SBE Entertainment when he
was attacked by Defendant Ehsan Bashi, who was substituted as Doe 1 on December
28, 2012. 
 
On May 24, 2014, Judge Roy Paul
entered judgment in favor of Plaintiff and found Defendant Bashi “is liable to
Plaintiff and shall pay Plaintiff the amount of $27,099.00 . . . , plus accrued
interest at the legal rate.”
 
On June 20, 2023, Bashi filed a
Notice of Related Case involving civil law cases BC482598 and 23SMCV01998 Bashi v.
Shadanloo and restraining order case 23STRO00340 Bashi v. Shadanloo.
The Notice suggested the cases may be related based upon the first, second, and
third grounds enumerated in California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a) without
additional explanation. 
 
On June 22, 2023, Judge Steven A. Ellis issued a minute
order finding the cases were not related.
 
Background
of 23STRO00340 Bashi v. Shadanloo
 
On January 23, 2023, Bashi
petitioned the court for a civil harassment restraining order and temporary
restraining order against Shadanloo alleging Shadanloo had made several threats
against Bashi and Bashi’s sister in November of 2022. Shadanloo filed a
response on February 6, 2023.
 
On March 22, 2023, the court
denied the request for a civil harassment restraining order. Bashi appealed
that order and the appeal remains pending.
 
Background
of 23SMCV01998 Bashi v. Shadanloo
 
On May 8, 2023, Bashi filed an
unlimited civil case against Shadanloo. The First Amended Complaint asserts a
single cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress based
upon allegations that Shadanloo sent threatening emails, text messages, and
voicemails to Bashi and his attorney in November of 2022.
 
Bashi’s
Evidentiary Objections
 
Bashi’s objections to Exhibits 1
and 2 of the Lonas declaration are OVERRULED. The remaining objections to the
declaration are SUSTAINED. 
 
Shadanloo’s
Request for Judicial Notice
 
On October 30, 2023, Shadanloo
filed a request for judicial notice of three court documents filed in the
respective cases. The request is GRANTED as to their existence and legal
effect, but not the truth of the matters asserted therein. (Evid. Code §
452(d).) Bashi filed an objection to the request on October 31, 2023, which is
not supported by authority. A party need only provide “sufficient notice of the
request,” (Evid. Code § 453(a)), and the Court necessarily reviews the court
file of each case when ruling on a request to relate cases. 
 
Discussion 
 
Department
1 is the Appropriate Department to Hear the Motion
 
Pursuant
to Los Angeles Superior Court Local Rules, rule 3.3(f)(2), “[w]here the cases
listed in a Notice of Related Cases contains a probate or family law case,
Department 1 shall determine whether the cases shall be ordered related and, if
so, to which department they shall be assigned if the cases are all pending in
the Central District or pending in two different districts.” A restraining
order case, such as 23STRO00340, is a family law case for this purpose. (LASC
Local Rules, rule 2.11 (“The following matters are also assigned to the Family
Law Division: any request for personal conduct or ‘stay away’ restraining order
which does not also seek money damages including a: 1. Request for civil
harassment restraining order. . . .”).) Thus, Department 1 is the proper
department to determine whether BC482598 or 23SMCV01998 should be related to
restraining order case 23STRO00340.
 
Additionally,
pursuant to Local Rule 3.3(f)(3), “[i]n the event that the judge designated
under California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1)(A)(B)(C) to make the
decision, does not order related any of the cases set forth in the Notice of
Related Cases, any party may file a motion to have the cases related.
Department 1 shall hear the motion, if the cases are all pending in the Central
District or are pending in two or more different districts.” As noted above, Judge
Ellis issued a minute order on June 22, 2023 finding the cases were not
related. Accordingly, Bashi’s motion is properly heard in Department 1.
 
Department
1 Declines to Relate the Cases
 
Bashi’s
motion cites rules regarding consolidation, (Mot. at 8:5-26), which is
premature. (LASC Local Rules, rule 3.3(g)(1) (“Cases may not be consolidated
unless they are in the same department.”).) Additionally, Department 1 does not
rule on requests to consolidate. Bashi also cites Local Rule 2.3(b)(1) and (2),
(Mot. at 9:5-18), which allow the Presiding Judge or Department 1 to transfer
cases between districts based upon enumerated circumstances not demonstrated
here. Local Rule 2.3(b) does not allow assignment to a specific department or
judicial officer, which is the relief sought by Bashi. The Court notes each
judicial officer is fully capable of deciding the issues before them, and
Bashi’s suggestion that one judicial officer is “better able” to preside over
the parties’ various disputes, (see e.g. Mot. at 11:10), is not well taken. 
 
As
noted above, the Local Rules of the Los Angeles Superior Court permit
Department 1 to relate pending cases. (LASC Local Rules, rule 3.3(f).) Los
Angeles Superior Court case BC482598 was disposed of by judgment in 2014 and is
therefore no longer pending for this purpose. Similarly, the trial court denied
the request for a civil harassment restraining order in 23STRO00340 and Bashi has
appealed this decision. Accordingly, 23STRO00340 is also no longer pending in
the Los Angeles Superior Court. Because only one case listed in the Notice of
Related Case is currently pending, the Court declines to relate the cases.
 
Separately,
Department 1 declines to relate the three cases on substantive grounds. Cases
are related when they (1) involve the same parties and are based on the same or
similar claims, (2) arise from the same or substantially identical
transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or
substantially identical questions of law or fact, (3) involve claims against,
title to, possession of, or damages to the same property, or (4) are likely for
other reasons to require substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard
by different judges. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a).)
 
The
cases involve the same parties but do not involve the same or substantially
similar claims, (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(1)), and do not arise from the same
or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events requiring the
determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact.
(Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(2).) The first filed action, BC482598, is completed,
arose out of an alleged attack at a night club in 2011, and does not involve
any substantive claims regarding Shadanloo’s
alleged November 2022 conduct. While the two more recently filed actions, 23STRO00340
and 23SMCV01998, involve Shadanloo’s
alleged November 2022 conduct, this commonality is not sufficient to warrant
relating the two cases. The restraining order case is a special proceeding
involving limited issues of fact and law. In the restraining order action, the
court, determined the evidence was insufficient to physically restrain
Shadanloo from Bashi and Bashi’s family. The restraining order action did not
involve claims for compensatory damages. In 23SMCV01998, the trier of fact, if
required, will determine whether Shadanloo is liable for intentional infliction
of emotional distress as well as the compensatory damages to be awarded if Bashi
were to prevail. 
 
The
cases also will not require a substantial duplication of judicial resources if
heard by different judges. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(4).) Bashi cites Code of
Civil Procedure sections 918 and 918.5, (Mot. at 10:5-12:8), which grants the
trial court discretion to stay the enforcement of a judgment where there is
another pending claim, here 23SMCV01998. The statute requires the court to
consider: “(1) The likelihood of the judgment debtor prevailing in the other
action. (2) The amount of the judgment of the judgment creditor as compared to
the amount of the probable recovery of the judgment debtor in the action on the
disputed claim. (3) The financial ability of the judgment creditor to satisfy
the judgment if a judgment is rendered against the judgment creditor in the
action on the disputed claim.” However, consideration of these factors are not
at issue in the other proceedings and a jury, not a judicial officer, will
serve as the trier of fact in 23SMCV01998. Bashi’s anticipated motion to stay
the judgment does not render the cases related.
 
The Court declines to relate BC482598,
23SMCV01998, and 23STRO00340 and the motion is DENIED.
