```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion filed by Ehsan Bashi to deem the cases related and request a transfer to the West District Courthouse. The court found that the cases do not meet the requirements for relation and will not require a substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges. The cases involve different claims and parties, and the restraining order case is a special proceeding that does not involve claims for compensatory damages. The court also found that Bashi's anticipated motion to stay the judgment does not render the cases related. Therefore, the court declines to relate BC482598, 23SMCV01998, and 23STRO00340 and the motion is denied.
