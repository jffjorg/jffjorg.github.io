And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiffs' motion to relate cases with prejudice. The court has reviewed the cases and finds that they are not related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300. The court has previously denied a similar motion and finds that the same arguments raised by the plaintiffs are not sufficient to satisfy the rule. The court notes that each case arises out of the individual plaintiff's specific exposure to different products, in different locations, over different time periods, under different working conditions. The court also finds that the cases will require the determination of substantially different questions of law and fact and are not likely to result in a substantial duplication of judicial resources. The court denies the motion and orders the cases to remain as assigned.
