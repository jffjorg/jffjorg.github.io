 Case Number:  22STCV11897    Hearing Date:   November 9, 2023    Dept:  1 22STCV11897            AUDREY
PETERS vs CAMERON DAVID ARTHUR HERBER
Defendants’ Motion for Coordination of this Action with
Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 22TRCV00996
TENTATIVE RULING: 
The motion is DENIED.
Background
of 22STCV11897 Peters v. Herber
 
On April 7, 2022, Audrey Peters
filed an unlimited civil complaint against Cameron David Arthur Herber and BC2
Environmental, LLC, which is currently pending in Department 28 of the Spring
Street Courthouse. The complaint alleges Defendant Herber caused his vehicle to
collide with Plaintiff Peters’ vehicle on April 7, 2020.
 
On January 25, 2023 and February 1, 2023, Defendants filed a
Notice of Related Cases on pleading paper, rather than on optional Judicial
Council form CM-015, that listed the relevant cases as “Audrey Peters vs.
Cameron David Arthur Herber, et al., Los Angeles County Superior Court Case
No. 22STCV11897” and “Audrey Gayl Peters vs. Stacia Elizabeth Trimmer,
Los Angeles County Superior Court Case No. 22TRCV00997.”
 
On May 24, 2023, the court issued
an order on Defendants’ motion to consolidate, noting cases cannot be
consolidated unless they are in the same department and “the
cases have not been deemed related. Defendants filed two Notices of Related
Case, both of which are identified as having listed the incorrect case number
and in need of re-filing. The Court denies the motion for failure to comply
with the local rules.” 
 
Neither party filed another
Notice of Related Case in 22STCV11897 to correct the error identified in the
court’s order.
 
Rather, Defendants filed a motion
for coordination, with the hearing set in Department 28 of the Spring Street
Courthouse. On October 2, 2023, Judge Lisa R. Jaskol issued an order denying
the motion, noting Los Angeles Superior Court Local Rule 3.3(h) provides “Coordination
motions seeking to transfer a case or cases to the Central District shall be
filed and heard in Department 1.” 
 
Background
of 22TRCV00996 Peters v. Trimmer
 
On October 20, 2022, Audrey
Peters filed an unlimited civil action against Stacia Elizabeth Trimmer, which
is currently pending in Department 8 of the Inglewood Courthouse. The complaint
alleges Defendant Trimmer caused their vehicle to collide with
Plaintiff Peters’ vehicle on November 24, 2020.
 
On June 8, 2023, Defendants Herber and BC2 Environmental filed
a Notice of Related Case in 22TRCV00996 on Judicial Council form CM-015.
 
Discussion 
 
Defendants’
motion relies upon Code of Civil Procedure section 403 and California Rules of
Court, rule 3.500 to argue that 22STCV11897 and 22TRCV00996 should be
coordinated and analyzes the two cases based upon the factors governing
coordination. 
 
However,
Defendants’ motion is procedurally defective. Coordination is a procedure whereby
cases pending in different superior courts, for example the Los Angeles County Superior
Court and Orange County Superior Court, are brought before a single judge in
one of the superior courts. (Code Civ. Proc. § 403 (“A judge may, on motion,
transfer an action or actions from another court to that judge’s court for
coordination with an action involving a common question of fact or law within
the meaning of Section 404.”); Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.500; LASC Local Rules, rule
3.3(h) (“A civil case which is not complex as defined by Standard 3.10 of the
Standards of Judicial Administration may be transferred to the court from a
superior court in another county, if it involves a common question of fact or
law within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 404.”).) While
22STCV1197 and 22TRCV00996 are pending in different departments in different
districts, they are both within one “court.” (See generally Glade v. Glade (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th
1441, 1449 (“Even though a superior court is divided into branches or
departments, pursuant to California Constitution, article VI, section 4, there
is only one superior court in a county and jurisdiction is therefore vested in
that court, not in any particular judge or department. Whether sitting
separately or together, the judges hold but one and the same court.”); LASC
Local Rules, rule 1.1(f) (“The term ‘court’ means the Superior Court of Los
Angeles County.”).) Because Code of Civil Procedure section 403 and the related
coordination rules govern transfers between “courts,” coordination is not the
proper procedure here. 
 
Therefore, Defendants’ motion is DENIED as
procedurally improper.
 
Defendants’
motion states their desire to have 22TRCV00996 heard by the same judicial
officer as 22STCV11897. (Mot. at 6:24-27.) The procedurally proper mechanism to
seek this result is to file a Notice of Related Case with accurate information
and in full compliance with the California Rules of Court. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(h)(1)(A) (“Where all
the cases listed in the notice are unlimited civil cases, . . . the judge who
has the earliest filed case must determine whether the cases must be ordered
related and assigned to his or her department.”).) 
 
Defendants
failed to comply with the California Rules of Court and therefore have not
properly brought a Notice of Related Case before the appropriate judicial
officer. Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(d), “[t]he Notice of
Related Case must be filed in all pending cases listed in the notice and must
be served on all parties in those cases.” As stated in the May 24, 2023 order issued in 22STCV11897,
Defendants’ Notices of Related Cases, filed on January 25, 2023 and February 1,
2023 in 22STCV11897, contained an incorrect case number. The Court acknowledges
Defendants listed the correct case number on the caption, but incorrectly
identified the case as 22TRCV00997 in the body of the two Notices. Additionally,
these Notices were not filed in 22TRCV00996 as required. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(d).)
 
On June 8, 2023, Defendants filed a new Notice of
Related Case, using Judicial Council form CM-015, in 22TRCV00996. Defendants
did not file the new Notice in 22STCV11897 as required. (Cal. R. Ct., rule
3.300(d).) As a result, the appropriate judicial officer has not had an opportunity
to rule on an accurate, properly filed, and properly served Notice of Related
Case. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(h)(1)(A).) While the California Rules of Court
and the Local Rules of the Los Angeles Superior Court authorize Department 1 to
relate cases upon a noticed motion, (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(h)(1)(D); LASC
Local Rules, rule 3.3(f)(3)), the judge designated under Rule 3.300(h)(1)(A)
must be given an opportunity to rule on a properly filed Notice.  
 
Accordingly, Defendants must file a new Notice of
Related Case, containing the correct case numbers, in 22STCV11897 to allow the
appropriate judicial officer an opportunity to rule on the Notice.
