```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion to determine the good faith of a settlement reached between the parties. The settlement was reached after negotiations between the parties, and the plaintiffs are seeking a court order to confirm that the settlement was made in good faith. The judge has determined that the settlement was made in good faith, and therefore, any other party who may have been involved in the incident cannot seek further claims against the settling parties for equitable comparative contribution or partial or comparative indemnity. The judge has also noted that the overwhelming majority of motions for good faith settlement determinations are unopposed and are granted summarily by the court.
