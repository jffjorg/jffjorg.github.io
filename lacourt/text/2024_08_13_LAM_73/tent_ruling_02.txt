I. BACKGROUND
 
On January 26, 2024, Plaintiff Claire Donahue brought this action
against Defendants 427 S Mariposa Partners, LP; LA Urban Living LLC; Jeclim
LLC; Jeremy Miller; Philip G. Miller and Annie Boxell. 
 
The Complaint alleges the following. Plaintiff was an occupant of
real property located at 427 S Mariposa, Unit 511 Los Angeles, CA (the
“Property”) as a lessee/tenant under a written lease with Defendants. Plaintiff
alleges that on April 6, 2020, Plaintiff reported an active leak and water
damage in the bedroom ceiling to management, who acknowledged the issue but
failed to conduct repairs despite multiple follow-ups. On January 25, 2022,
Plaintiff discovered additional mold growth in the bedroom after heavy rains.
Plaintiff informed the building manager and requested repairs. During Plaintiff’s tenancy, Defendants failed to maintain the
Property in a safe and habitable condition. Plaintiff was eventually forced to vacate the Property due to
health issues while living in the Property. Defendants constructively evicted
Plaintiff from the Property—having refused to make the required repairs to the
Property and ensure the Property be made safe and habitable, and after
Plaintiff told Defendants that Plaintiff suspected that the fungal growth at
the Property was making Plaintiff sick. The Complaint alleges the following
causes of action:
1.      Breach of the
implied warranty of habitability;
2.      Nuisance;
3.      Breach of
contract;
4.      Negligence;
5.      Negligent
misrepresentation;
6.      Constructive eviction;
7.      Premises
liability;
8.      Fraud; and 
9.      Intentional
infliction of emotional distress.
 
On July 10, 2024, Defendant 427 S
Mariposa Partners, LP filed the Motion to Deem
Request for Admissions, Set One, Admitted and Request for Sanctions. No opposition
has been filed.
 
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard 
 
 When a party fails to
serve a timely response to a request for admission, the party propounding the
request for admission may move for an order to deem the genuineness of any
documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests admitted. (Code
Civ. Proc., §¿2033.280, subd. (b).) A party who fails to provide a timely
response waives any objection, including one based on privilege or work
product. (Id., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The court shall make this order,
unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been
directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to
the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section
2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction… on the
party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (Id., § 2033.280,
subd. (c).)
 
B.      Discussion
 
On March 22, 2024, Defendant 427 S
Mariposa Partners, LP served Plaintiff electronically with Requests for
Admissions, Set One. (Ghattas Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A). Plaintiff’s responses were
due on April 24, 2024, 30 days following service, plus an additional two court
days for electronic service. (Cal. Code Civ. Pro. §§ 2030.260, subd. (a) and
1013, subd. (a).) However, Plaintiff failed to provide responses by April 24,
2024. (Ghattas Decl., ¶ 3.) 
 
The parties met and conferred regarding Plaintiff’s failure to
respond. On April 25, 2024, Defendant sent an email to Plaintiff’s counsel to
confer about Plaintiff’s failure to respond to Defendant’s written discovery
requests. Defendant
allowed Plaintiff until May 3, 2024 to serve verified answers without
objections to Defendant’s discovery requests. (Ghattas Decl., ¶ 4.) On April 25, 2024, in response to Defendant’s meet and confer
correspondence, Plaintiff’s counsel claimed that Defendant failed to properly
serve their written discovery requests in violation of Code of Civil Procedure
section 1010.6(b)(3). (Ghattas Decl., ¶ 5.) On April 25, 2024, Defendant
offered to grant Plaintiff an extension of time to respond as another sign of
good faith. (Ghattas Decl., ¶ 6.) On April 29, 2024, after receiving no
response, Defendant followed up with Plaintiff’s counsel to determine how long
Plaintiff will need to provide Defendant with her responses. (Ghattas Decl., ¶
7.) On April 30, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel stated that he would accept service
electronically from April 30, 2024, making Plaintiff’s responses due on or
before June 4, 2024. (Ghattas Decl., ¶ 8.) On June 7, 2024, after still not
receiving Plaintiff’s responses, Defendant sent Plaintiff’s counsel a second
email to meet and confer, extending Plaintiff until June 14, 2024 to provide
verified answers, without objection. (Ghattas Decl., ¶ 9.) As of the date of
the filing of the instant motion, Defendant has not received any communication
from Plaintiff’s counsel regarding Plaintiff’s Response to Defendant’s Request
for Admissions, nor has Defendant received Plaintiff’s Response to Defendant’s
Request for Admissions. (Ghattas Decl., ¶ 10.)
 
Here, Defendant offered Plaintiff multiple extensions to provide
Defendant with her responses. However, Plaintiff has failed to serve responses.
Therefore, the motion is granted. The truth
of the matters specified in Request for Admissions, Set One, are hereby deemed
admitted.
 
Defendant requests monetary sanctions for counsel’s work on its
Motion to Deem Request
for Admissions, Set One, Admitted against
Plaintiff. Defendant requests a total of $1,360.00, representing 5 hours of
attorney work at an hourly rate of $260, plus $60 for the filing fee. (Id.
¶¶ 12-13.)   
 
The Court finds sanctions are warranted because Plaintiff has
failed to respond. However, since the motion is unopposed, the Court will not award
Defendant’s anticipated fees for preparing a Reply. The Court awards Defendant attorney’s
fees for the 1.5 hours spent preparing the motion, 1 hour of the anticipated fees
for Defendant to prepare for and attend the motion hearing and the filing fee. Therefore, the Court awards Plaintiff’s request for sanctions
in the reduced total amount of $710.00. 
 
III. DISPOSITION

 
Defendant
427 S Mariposa Partners, LP’s Motion to Deem Request for Admissions, Set One,
Admitted is GRANTED. The truth
of the matters specified in Request for Admissions, Set One, are hereby deemed
admitted.
 
The
Court further GRANTS Defendant 427 S Mariposa Partners, LP’s request for
monetary sanctions against Plaintiff in the reduced amount of $710.00. Said monetary sanctions
are to be paid to counsel for Defendant 427 S Mariposa Partners, LP’s within 30
days of the date of this order.
