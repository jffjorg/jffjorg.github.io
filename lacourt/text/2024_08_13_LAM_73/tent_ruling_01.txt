MOTION FOR AN ORDER TO COMPEL DEPOSITION
OF DEFENDANT MARCHEL GABRIELLE AUGUSTE (filed 03/14/24)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Pentz’s Motion to Compel Deposition of Marchel
Gabrielle Auguste is DENIED without prejudice.  
BACKGROUND
 
On April 30, 2021, Plaintiff Thomas
Wesley Pentz (“Pentz”) filed a Complaint (the “Pentz Lawsuit”) against Defendant
Marchel Gabrielle Auguste, aka Shelly Auguste (“Auguste”). On September 16,
2021, Pentz filed a First Amended Complaint for (1) Stalking; (2) Trespass; and
(3) Distribution of Private Materials (Revenge Pornography) Civ. Code section
1708.85.
 
Pentz alleges, among other things, in
his Complaint that Auguste stalked Pentz online, showed up at his residence
uninvited and repeatedly sent sexually explicit
photographs and videos of Pentz to his friends and family. 
 
On June 25, 2021, Marchel Gabrielle
Auguste filed a Complaint (the “Auguste Lawsuit”) against Thomas Wesley Pentz.
In Auguste’s First Amended Complaint filed on August 10, 2022, she alleges
causes of action for (1) Sexual Battery; (2) Gender Violence; (3) Violation of
the Ralph Civil Rights Act; (4) Violation of the Tom Bane Civil Rights Act; (5)
Action Based on Civil Code § 1708.85; (6) Intentional Intrusion Into Private
Affairs; (7) Battery; (8) Assault; (9) Defamation; (10) Intentional Infliction
of Emotional Distress; and (11) Fraud.  
  
Auguste has sued alleging, among other things, the following: (i)
Pentz communicated with her when she was a minor; (ii) groomed her; (iii) gave
her an STD; (iv) ejaculated inside her; (v) raped her; (vi) defamed her and
(vii) committed revenge porn against her. Auguste alleges that all the
aforementioned acts caused her severe emotional distress.
 
On August 1, 2021, Pentz filed a
Notice of Related Case. On September 14, 2021, the Court ruled
the Pentz Lawsuit 21STCV16321 and the Auguste Lawsuit 21STCV23647 were related
within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a). 21STCV16321,
the Pentz Lawsuit, is the lead case.  
 
On March 14,
2024, Pentz filed the instant Motion to Compel Deposition of Marchel Gabrielle Auguste aka
Shelly Auguste. Pentz also requests sanctions. 
 
No opposition was filed. 
 
On August 8, 2024, Pentz filed a notice of non-opposition. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard
 
Any
party may obtain discovery, subject to restrictions, by taking the oral
deposition of any person, including any party to the action. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2025.010.) A party desiring to take an oral deposition shall give a notice in
writing which states the specification of reasonably particularly of any
materials to be produced by the deponent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.220, subd.
(a)(4).) A properly served deposition notice is effective to require a party to
attend and to testify, as well as to produce documents for inspection and
copying. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280, subd. (a).) The party served with a
deposition notice waives any error or irregularity unless that party promptly
serves a written objection at least three calendar days prior to the date for
which the deposition is scheduled. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410, subd.
(a).)  
 
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action … without having
served a valid objection … fails to appear for examination, … or to produce for
inspection any document, … described in the deposition notice, the party giving
the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent's attendance and
testimony, and the production for inspection of any document … described in the
deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)   
 
A
motion brought to compel a deposition “shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to
attend the deposition … by a declaration stating that the petitioner has
contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (b)(2).)  
 
B.      Discussion
 
Pentz moves
the Court for an order compelling Auguste to appear at deposition. 
 
Pentz asserts
in his motion that Pentz served a notice of deposition on Auguste on February
22, 2024 for a deposition date of March 13, 2024. (Yeghiayan Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.) On
March 12, 2024, a day before the noticed deposition, Pentz’s counsel inquired
as to whether Auguste would be appearing. (Yeghiayan Decl., ¶ 4.)
Auguste did not respond to the email and did not serve objections prior to the
deposition. (Ibid.) Auguste did not appear for her March 13, 2024
deposition and a notice of non-appearance was taken. (Yeghiayan Decl.,
¶ 5.) 
 
However, the Court notes that Pentz’s counsel’s declaration does
not state that “the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance” pursuant to Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(2). A motion brought to compel a deposition
“shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040,
or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition … by a declaration stating
that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(2).) Here, the
deponent failed to attend the deposition. It does not appear that Pentz’s
counsel attempted to contact the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance or
has made a good faith attempt to resolve the deposition issue prior to filing
this motion. Thus, the Court does not find Pentz has satisfied the requirements
of Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450,
subdivision (b)(2).
 
Accordingly,
the Court denies Pentz’s motion without prejudice. Since the Court denies
Pentz’s motion, requests for sanctions are also denied. 
 
CONCLUSION 
Plaintiff
Pentz’s Motion to Compel Deposition of Marchel Gabrielle Auguste is DENIED
without prejudice.
