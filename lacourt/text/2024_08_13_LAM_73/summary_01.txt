The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Thomas Wesley Pentz's Motion to Compel Deposition of Defendant Marchel Gabrielle Auguste. The motion was filed on March 14, 2024, seeking to compel Defendant Auguste to appear for a deposition. However, Defendant Auguste failed to appear for the deposition, which was scheduled for March 13, 2024. The judge has denied the motion without prejudice, finding that Plaintiff Pentz has not satisfied the requirements for compelling a deposition. Specifically, the judge notes that Plaintiff Pentz's counsel did not attempt to contact the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance prior to filing the motion. As a result, the judge does not find that Plaintiff Pentz has made a good faith attempt to resolve the deposition issue prior to filing the motion.
