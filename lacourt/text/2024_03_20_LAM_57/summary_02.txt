And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The judge has granted Defendant Juan Rivera's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The plaintiff, Firestone Plaza, LLC, brought a breach of contract action against Rivera and others, alleging that they failed to pay rent and abandoned the property. However, the judge has ruled that Firestone's complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a breach of contract claim against Rivera because the complaint seeks to enforce Rivera's guarantee of the unit F lease for rent incurred during the COVID-19 pandemic period, which is prohibited by the Los Angeles County COVID-19 Tenant Protections Resolution. The judge has granted Firestone leave to amend its complaint to avoid this defect.
