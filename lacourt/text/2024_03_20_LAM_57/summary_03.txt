And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion filed by PopID, Inc. (Defendant) to compel the Plaintiff to provide further responses to form interrogatories is defective. The Judge finds that the separate statement in support of the motion is defective in two respects: it is overinclusive and underinclusive. The Judge orders that the hearing on the motion be continued so that PopID, Inc. can submit a revised separate statement that complies with the rules. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff's opposition to the motion is defective as it did not submit a separate statement of its own.

Additionally, the Judge finds that the separate statement in support of PopID, Inc.'s motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents is also defective. The Judge orders that PopID, Inc. file two separate motions: one for compliance and another for further responses. The Judge denies the motion without prejudice, stating that PopID, Inc. needs to follow the proper procedure for compelling compliance and further responses.
