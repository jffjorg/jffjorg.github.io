And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint. The complaint was dismissed on September 4, 2024, due to the plaintiff's failure to serve the defendant and file a required declaration. The plaintiff filed the motion to set aside the dismissal on October 23, 2024, arguing that the dismissal was the result of their counsel's mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. The judge found that the dismissal was caused by the plaintiff's counsel's mistake, and the motion was timely filed within six months of the dismissal. As a result, the dismissal is vacated, and the complaint is reinstated. The judge also set an order to show cause re dismissal for failure to file a proof of service for December 31, 2024, requiring the plaintiff to either file a proof of service or explain why service has not been made.
