And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this personal injury action. The plaintiff seeks discovery responses and monetary sanctions from the defendants, Joseph Edward Squirek, Frito Lay, and Does 1 to 20. The defendants have provided verified responses to some of the plaintiff's discovery requests, but are seeking an additional 30 days to respond to others due to other professional obligations and a delay in identifying the correct Frito-Lay personnel to assist in responding to the propounded discovery. The judge orders the defendants to provide verified responses to the plaintiff's remaining discovery requests by September 13, 2024, and denies the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions.
