 Case Number:  24LBCV00441    Hearing Date:   August 13, 2024    Dept:  S25 BackgroundOn March 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants Peter S. Birnbaum, M.D., Long Beach Memorial Medical Center and Does 1 to 100. Plaintiffs allege three causes of action: (1) health care provider negligence leading to injury or death, per Civil Code, § 3333.1; (2) failure to obtain informed consent; and (3) medical battery. Plaintiff alleges that on or about December 7, 2022, he went to Defendant Long Beach MMC for a cyst removal procedure on his right hand and that Defendant Birnbaum performed the procedure while Plaintiff was under general anesthesia. (Compl., ¶¶ 15-17.) Plaintiff further alleges that during the procedure Defendant Birnbaum removed a small bone from Plaintiff’s thumb without Plaintiff’s consent, informed or otherwise, and severed a tendon in Plaintiff’s hand. (Compl., ¶¶ 18, 19, 22.) Plaintiff also states that Defendant Birnbaum discussed the additional procedure with Plaintiff while Plaintiff was under anesthesia and that Plaintiff has neither any recollection of any discussion with Defendant Birnbaum during the procedure nor any recollection of giving Defendant Birnbaum consent to remove the thumb bone. (Compl., ¶¶ 20-21.)On June 13, 2024, Defendant Birnbaum filed the instant demurrer. On June 27, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On August 6, 2024, Defendant Birnbaum filed a reply.On July 31, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for entry of default against Defendant Ambulatory Surgery Center-LB, LLC.Legal StandardA demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party’s pleading. It is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purpose of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true, however improbable they may be.A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v.Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311.) No other extrinsic evidence can be considered (i.e., no “speaking demurrers”). A demurrer is brought under Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10 [grounds], § 430.30 [as to any matter on its face or from which judicial notice may be taken], and § 430.50, subd. (a) [can be taken to the entire complaint or any cause of action within]. Specifically, a demurrer may be brought per Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e) if insufficient facts are stated to support the cause of action asserted. Per Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (a), a demurrer may be brought where the court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the pleading. Furthermore, a demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained only where the complaint is so bad that the defendant cannot reasonably respond. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f).)However, in construing the allegations, the court is to give effect to specific factual allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent general or conclusory allegations. (Financial Corporation of America v. Wilburn (1987) 189 Cal.App.3rd 764, 769.) And, if the facts pled in the complaint are inconsistent with facts which are incorporated by reference from exhibits attached to the complaint, the facts in the incorporated exhibits control. Further, irrespective of the name or label given to a cause of action by the plaintiff, a general demurrer must be overruled if the facts as plead in the body of the complaint state some valid claim for relief. Special demurrers are not allowed in limited jurisdiction courts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (c).)Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)Finally, Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).) Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(3).)Meet and ConferThe Court finds the parties met and conferred in accordance with Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41. (Valentine Decl., ¶ 2.)Tentative Ruling“A typical medical battery case is where a patient has consented to a particular treatment, but the doctor performs a treatment that goes beyond the consent.” (Conte v. Girard Orthopaedic Surgeons Medical Group, Inc. (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1260, 1267; see CACI no. 503A.) “When an action is based upon the theory of surgery beyond consent, the gist of such action is the unwarranted exceeding of the consent. This is a theory of technical battery.” (Ibid. quoting [Pedesky v. Bleiberg (1967) 251 Cal.App.2d 119, 123].) On the other hand, conditional battery is a claim for medical battery under a violation of conditional consent. The patient must allege: (1) the patient's consent was conditional; (2) the doctor intentionally violated the condition while providing treatment; and (3) the patient suffered harm as a result of the doctor's violation of the condition. (Conte, supra, 107 Cal.App.4th at 1269 [citing Ashcraft v. King (1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 604, 611.)Here, Plaintiff sufficiently alleges facts to state a claim for medical battery. In paragraph 20, Plaintiff states that Defendant Birnbaum discussed the additional procedure with Plaintiff while Plaintiff was under anesthesia. Plaintiff alleges he has no recollection of the discussion with Defendant Birnbaum during the cyst removal procedure and no recollection of giving Defendant Birnbaum consent to remove the thumb bone. (Compl., ¶ 21.) These allegations are sufficient to support Plaintiff’s assertion that that no consent was given to Defendant Birnbaum to remove a bone in Plaintiff’s thumb. Lastly, Plaintiff medical battery claim is not so uncertain to the extent that Defendant cannot reasonably respond. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f).)Defendant’s demurrer to the Third (3rd) Cause of Action for Medical Battery is OVERRULED. Defendant to answer within 20 days of this order.
