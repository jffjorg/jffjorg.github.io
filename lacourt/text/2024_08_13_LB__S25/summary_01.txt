And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion to compel further responses to Requests for Production of Documents (Set One) and Special Interrogatories (Set One) filed by Plaintiffs Arthur Quintans, Jr and Krystal Quintans against Defendant Smiths Detection Inc. (SDI).

The court finds that some of the requests are overly broad, unduly burdensome, or ambiguous and denies the requests accordingly. Specifically, the court denies requests for documents related to corporate history and structure, efforts to determine health hazards from and protect employees from radiation, patents or patent applications, and indemnity agreements.

The court also denies requests for further responses to Special Interrogatories Nos. 20-22 and 25, which seek information about communications from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency and the National Treasury Employees Union regarding hazardous quantities of radiation associated with the HCVM X-ray screening system.

The court denies Plaintiffs' request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,400, as the motion does not contain a declaration setting forth a breakdown of costs and attorneys' fees for sanctions.

The court concludes that Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses is denied in part, and that Defendant SDI's responses to Requests for Production of Documents (Set One) and Special Interrogatories (Set One) are adequate.
