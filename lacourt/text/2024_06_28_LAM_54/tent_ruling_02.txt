Hearing Date: June 28, 2024
Department 54, Judge Maurice A. Leiter
Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs
Moving Party: Plaintiff 740 South Broadway
Associates, LLC
Responding Party: Defendant Chol Enterprises, Inc.
 
T/R:      PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES IS DENIED.
PLAINTIFF TO NOTICE.
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing. 
 
The Court considers the moving papers,
opposition, and reply.
 
Plaintiff moves for an award of
attorney’s fees and costs under CCP § 685.040,
which provides that “a
judgment creditor is entitled to the reasonable and necessary costs of
enforcing a judgment.” The parties’ lease agreement contains an attorney’s fees
provision. 
 
Plaintiff seeks attorney’s fees in the amount of $111,603.50 and costs
in the amount of $2,785.13, for a total amount of $114,388.63. This total
includes fees and costs incurred in defending a separate action (Case No.
23STCV31162) filed by Defendant to recover personal property remaining at the
premises after Plaintiff took repossession.  
 
In opposition, Defendant asserts that this motion is untimely, and that Plaintiff
cannot recover fees for the separate action. CCP § 685.030(d)(2) requires that a
motion for post-judgment enforcement costs be filed before full satisfaction of
the judgment. Defendant represents that Plaintiff delayed in providing
instructions to pay the judgment so Plaintiff could file this motion.
Ultimately, Defendant overnighted a check to Plaintiff on May 13, 2024, which
Plaintiff received on May 14, 2024. Plaintiff filed and served the motion on
May 13, 2024. The parties dispute the timeliness down to the minute of filing
and mailing.
 
The Court need not resolve the drama concerning the timeliness of the
motion. Nor will the Court wade into the fetid waters of incivility befouling the
parties’ interactions. Plaintiff has not shown entitlement to the fees and
costs requested. Courts have held that a judgment creditor may recover fees and
costs incurred in a separate action to enforce a judgment. (See e.g. Jaffe
v. Pacelli (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 927, 938 [Judgment creditor could recover
fees incurred in judgment debtor’s bankruptcy proceedings.]) But that is not
what happened here. The separate action filed by Defendant is to recover
possession of personal property on the premises based on an oral agreement
between the parties. Defense against these allegations is not enforcement of
the judgment in this action. 
 
Plaintiff makes no effort to separate the fees incurred in this action
and those incurred in the other. Accordingly, the Court cannot apportion fees.
Plaintiff’s motion is DENIED.
