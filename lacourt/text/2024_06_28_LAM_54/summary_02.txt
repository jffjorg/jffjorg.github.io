And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for attorney's fees and costs filed by Plaintiff 740 South Broadway Associates, LLC. The motion is denied. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has not shown entitlement to the fees and costs requested, which total $114,388.63. The fees and costs were incurred in defending a separate action filed by Defendant Chol Enterprises, Inc. to recover personal property remaining at the premises after Plaintiff took repossession. The Court notes that the separate action is not related to the enforcement of the judgment in this action. The Plaintiff made no effort to separate the fees incurred in this action from those incurred in the other, and therefore, the Court cannot apportion fees. The Court also declines to resolve the dispute over the timeliness of the motion and the incivility between the parties.
