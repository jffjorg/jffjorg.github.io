Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 20STCV12027. The case arises from an alleged automobile accident on March 29, 2018, near the intersection of Fairfax Avenue and Rosewood Avenue in Los Angeles, California. The Plaintiff, Anne Josef Mlinek, filed a Complaint against the Defendant, Agnes Frankel, and Does 1 through 50. The Defendant filed an Answer, and State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company intervened in the case.

The Plaintiff filed a motion to deem admitted the truth of the matters specified in the Requests for Admission (RFAs) or to compel further responses. The Defendant and State Farm filed an opposition to the motion. The Judge denied the Plaintiff's request to deem admitted the truth of the matters specified in the RFAs. The Judge granted the motion to compel further responses, ordering the Defendant to serve verified, code-compliant responses to the RFAs without objection within 45 days of notice of the order. The Judge also granted the Plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,260, calculated as four hours of attorney time preparing the motion, reviewing the opposition, and attending the hearing, multiplied by counsel's billing rate of $300 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee. The Judge denied the Plaintiff's request for sanctions against the Defendant's counsel.
