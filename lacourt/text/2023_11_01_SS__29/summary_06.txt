Summary in English:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion to consolidate two separate lawsuits, Case No. 22STCV02846 and Case No. 23CHCV00835. The lawsuits involve similar facts and legal issues, but the judge has denied the motion to consolidate due to the risk of unnecessary cost, delay, prejudice, and potential confusion of issues for the jury. The lawsuits stem from a multi-vehicle accident on September 29, 2021, and involve similar theories of liability. However, the judge has concluded that the benefits of consolidation are outweighed by the risk of unnecessary cost and delay, and that the parties may diverge in how they want to proceed with trial. The judge encourages the parties to consider alternative methods for streamlining discovery and avoiding unnecessary expense and duplication of effort.
