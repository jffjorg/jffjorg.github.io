 Case Number:  22STCV18686    Hearing Date:   November 1, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE
The motion for terminating sanctions and evidentiary sanctions
is DENIED.
The motion for monetary sanctions is GRANTED.
Background
Plaintiffs Brandon Dalton and Terrell Lee (“Plaintiffs”)
alleged that they were injured in an automobile accident on Juny 5, 2020, near
the intersection of Alondra Boulevard and Wilmington Avenue in Compton,
California.  On June 8, 2020, Plaintiffs
filed a Complaint asserting a single cause of action for negligence against
Defendants Ricardo Reta, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, County of Los
Angeles, and Does 1 through 100.  Plaintiffs
allege that the accident was caused by Defendant Reta’s negligence and that
Defendant Reta was acting within the course and scope of his employment at the
time of the accident.
On July 25, 2022, Defendant County of Los Angeles (“Defendant”)
filed an Answer.  On June 20, 2023,
Defendant Reta filed an Answer.
On August 23, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s motions to
compel Plaintiff Terrell Lee (“Plaintiff”) to serve initial responses to Form
Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), Requests for
Production (Set One), and Request for Statement of Damages.  The Court ordered Plaintiff to provide responses
within 30 days and to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $920 within 30
days.
Plaintiff did not provide the responses as ordered.  (Whitelaw Decl., ¶ 12.)
On October 6, 2023, Defendant filed this motion seeking
terminating, evidentiary, and/or monetary sanctions.
Plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion.  The Court notes, however, that Plaintiff’s
counsel has filed a motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff, and in
support of that motion Plaintiff’s counsel states that they have had no communication
of any kind with Plaintiff in more than a year.
Legal Standard 
“To the extent authorized
by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or any other provision
of this title, the court, after notice to any affected party, person, or
attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose the following sanctions
against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process:
... (d) The court may impose a terminating sanction …."  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) “Misuses of the discovery process include, but are not
limited to, the following: ... (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery. ... (g) Disobeying a court order to provide
discovery."  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)
The Civil Discovery Act
provides for an escalating and “incremental approach to discovery sanctions,
starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of
termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York,
Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should
be appropriate to and commensurate with the misconduct, and they “should not
exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to
but denied discovery.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174
Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater
sanction is warranted: continuing misuses of the discovery process warrant
incrementally harsher sanctions until the sanction is reached that will curb
the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also, e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet
Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions
should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p.
992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75
Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the authority
to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating sanction
should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less severe
alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly shows
lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th
at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are “willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders
that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.
Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan
v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain
compliance with the Civil Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to
punish. (Newland v. Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608,
613; Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20
Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery sanction should not create a “windfall” for
a party or place a party in a better position than it would have been if the
opposing party had simply complied with its obligations under the Court’s
orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015)
238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023),
¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
Discussion             
Defendant’s request for terminating sanctions is
denied at this stage in the proceedings. 
Violation of a single court discovery order is not the type of “extreme”
conduct that would support imposition of terminating sanctions as the next measure.  (Lopez, supra, 246
Cal.App.4th at 604.)  That is
particularly true here, where it is unclear whether Plaintiff himself is even
aware of the discovery order.
 
Defendant’s request for evidentiary sanctions is
denied.  The notice of motion fails to
set forth the specific evidentiary sanctions Defendant requested.  In addition, as with the terminating
sanctions, evidentiary sanctions based on failure to comply with a single
discovery order is unwarranted and overly punitive.  (Newland, supra, 40 Cal.App.4th
at 613.)
Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions is
granted.  Defendant has continued to
incur costs in seeking to enforce Plaintiff’s obligations under the Civil
Discovery Act and this Court’s order. 
Plaintiff’s ongoing failure to meet his obligations is not substantially
justified, and the imposition of sanctions would not be unjust.  The Court sets sanctions in the amount of
$1,150, calculated based on five hours of attorney time multiplied by counsel’s
reasonable billing rate of $230 per hour. 
Conclusion
The Court DENIES Defendant’s motion for terminating
sanctions and evidentiary sanctions.
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s
request for monetary sanctions.  The Court ORDERS Plaintiff Terrell
Lee to pay sanctions to Plaintiffs under the Civil Discovery Act in the amount
of $1,150 within 30 days of notice of this order.
Moving parties are ordered
to give notice.
