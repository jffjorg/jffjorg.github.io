And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to continue the trial from February 2, 2024, to June 7, 2024. The defendants argued that good cause exists for a continuance because their lead trial counsel will be engaged in other trials on the current trial date, all parties agree to the continuance, and there are no prior continuances. The judge considered the factors outlined in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, including the proximity of the trial date, whether there was any previous continuance, the length of the continuance requested, and whether all parties have stipulated to a continuance. The judge also considered that the parties have diligently conducted discovery to date and that no party would be prejudiced by a trial continuance. Therefore, the judge has granted the motion to continue the trial and reset the Final Status Conference and all deadlines based on the new trial date.
