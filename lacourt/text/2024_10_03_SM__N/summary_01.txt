And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions. The first motion is from Bristol Capital Ventures LLC, which seeks to set aside a default judgment entered against it due to a mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. The judge has granted this motion, finding that Bristol's representations that the complaint was overlooked due to a property manager's departure sufficiently state excusable neglect.

The second motion is from Golden State Water Company, which seeks to compel further deposition answers from Plaintiff Carlos Lopez regarding his prior felony conviction for forgery. The judge has granted this motion, finding that the evidence sought is likely admissible to impeach Plaintiff's credibility and that the probative value of this evidence outweighs the potential prejudice. The judge notes that this does not relieve Golden State Water Company of a duty to show that the evidence has a tendency to disprove Plaintiff's credibility, and that the evidence must be connected to Plaintiff's credibility in some way, or it will not be admitted at trial.
