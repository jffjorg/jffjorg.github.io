And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Mercury Insurance Company's motion for leave to intervene in the lawsuit. The lawsuit was filed by Pablo Flores against Sean Rodriguez, Marie Schafer, and others, alleging causes of action for motor vehicle and general negligence. Sean Rodriguez has been uncooperative and has not responded to discovery requests, making it difficult for his defense counsel to defend the action. Mercury Insurance Company has a direct interest in the lawsuit because Rodriguez is its insured, and it will have to pay compensatory damages subject to policy limitations if the plaintiff prevails. The court finds that Mercury Insurance Company has a direct interest in the case and its involvement will not enlarge the issues. Therefore, the motion is granted, and Mercury Insurance Company is permitted to intervene in the lawsuit to defend its insured, Sean Rodriguez.
