Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, Financial Partners Credit Union, against the plaintiff, Patricia Ferrara. The demurrer challenged the sufficiency of the complaint, alleging that it failed to state a cause of action. The court denied the demurrer in part and sustained it in part. The court found that the complaint adequately stated claims for discrimination, harassment, and retaliation under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), as well as a claim for wrongful termination. However, the court sustained the demurrer as to the eighth cause of action, a whistleblower claim, with 20 days leave to amend. The court also found that the complaint adequately stated claims for failure to prevent misconduct and wrongful termination. The court's ruling is subject to change based on further briefing and oral argument.
