[1] The
Court deferred – that is, postponed -- ruling on certain other causes of action,
including the fourth and seventh causes of action in the Complaint and certain
causes of action in the Cross Complaints, pending the jury’s determination of
factual issues related to the various fraud, theft, and conversion allegations.
None of the causes of action that were before the Court in Phase 1 will be
before the jury in Phase 2; the parties’ suggestions to the contrary are
incorrect. The Court will issue a final ruling on those deferred causes of
action after it has the benefit of the jury’s verdict on the remaining causes
of action.
