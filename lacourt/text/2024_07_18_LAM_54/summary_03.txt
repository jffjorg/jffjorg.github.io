And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering two motions: one to strike portions of the plaintiffs' first amended complaint and one to quash the service of summons and complaint. The motion to strike seeks to remove certain paragraphs from the complaint that the defendant argues are vague and do not comply with the standard for pleading in toxic tort cases.

The judge grants the motion to strike in part, striking page 7, line 3 of the complaint, which the defendant argues is a "catch-all" provision that does not specify the products that allegedly caused the plaintiffs' injuries.

The judge denies the motion to strike in part, finding that the plaintiffs have adequately alleged a claim for fraud and are entitled to seek punitive damages.

The judge grants the motion to quash the service of summons and complaint, finding that the service was improper under the Hague Service Convention. The plaintiffs had served the defendant through a process server in Canada, but the judge finds that the service was not in compliance with the laws of both California and British Columbia.

The judge also finds that the plaintiffs have not met their evidentiary burden to demonstrate that the defendant purposefully availed itself of the benefits of doing business in California, and therefore does not have specific personal jurisdiction over the defendant.
