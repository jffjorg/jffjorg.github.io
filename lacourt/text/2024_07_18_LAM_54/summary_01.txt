And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings, which was filed on the grounds that the court's factual findings in Phase 1 are predicates for the plaintiff's remaining claims, and those claims now fail as a matter of law. The court disagrees, finding that the defendants' alleged misrepresentations, conversions, and diversions of money owed to the plaintiff are not necessarily precluded by the court's previous findings. The judge notes that the plaintiff may still have claims based on the defendants' actions, such as transferring assets and money from entities in which the plaintiff had an interest to entities in which he did not have an interest, or making misrepresentations as part of these efforts. The judge is granting the defendants' notice that the tentative ruling is subject to change if the parties wish to submit further arguments.
