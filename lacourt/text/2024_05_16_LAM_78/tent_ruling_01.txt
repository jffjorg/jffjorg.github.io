  Case Number:  23STCV27185    Hearing Date:   May 16, 2024    Dept:  78 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78  JOSEPH ROESLER,Plaintiff, vs.CITY OF LOS ANGELES,Defendant.   Case No.:  23STCV27185 Hearing Date:  May 16, 2024      [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:  MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS FILED BY DEFENDANT CITY OF LOS ANGELESDefendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings is DENIED.Moving party to provide notice.FACTUAL BACKGROUNDThis is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief based upon a violation of the California Coastal Act.Plaintiff Joseph Roesler, as a taxpayer, alleges that Defendant the City of Los Angeles illegally blocked access to the beach by prohibiting parking along both sides of Vista Del Mar, a road running parallel to Dockweiler Beach from Imperial Highway to Napoleon Street (the “Subject Roadway”).  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant acted in violation of the California Coastal Act (“COLA”) in taking these actions as it did not obtain a coastal development permit from the California Coastal Commission.  The Complaint further alleges that since at least 2005, Defendant knew the Subject Roadway was in a dangerous condition that was hazardous to motorists and pedestrians crossing it to get to Dockweiler Beach. (Complaint ¶¶ 4-8.) Plaintiff alleges that since 2015 there have been several fatalities due to accidents between beachgoers and motor vehicles due to the lack of appropriate lighting, warning signs, and marked crosswalks. Plaintiff contends that in 2017, in response to safety concerns and public complaints, Defendant removed parking on both sides of the Subject Roadway for three miles in violation of COLA. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that 400 parking spaces were removed and no substitute parking was provided. Defendant acted in violation of the law by restricting access to the beach without receiving permission from the California Coastal Commission.    DISCUSSION Defendant moves for judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that (1) Plaintiff’s claims are time barred and (2) Plaintiff’s claims were filed under the wrong statute and must be pursued via a petition for a writ of mandate.A defendant may move for judgment on the pleadings when the “complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc., section 438(b)(1) and (c)(1)(B)(ii).)“A motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that can be judicially noticed. Presentation of extrinsic evidence is therefore not proper on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.” (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999 (Citations Omitted).) The standard for ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as that applicable to a general demurrer, that is, under the state of the pleadings, together with matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Bezirdjian v. O'Reilly (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 316, 321-322 (citing Schabarum v. California Legislature (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216).)“No motion may be made pursuant to this section if a pretrial conference order has been entered pursuant to Section 575, or within 30 days of the date the action is initially set for trial, whichever is later, unless the court otherwise permits.” Judicial NoticeEvidence Code Section 452 provides that judicial notice may be taken for facts and propositions that are “not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.” (Evid. Code, section 452(h).) Further, “a court may take judicial notice of [recorded documents and] the fact of a document's recordation, the date the document was recorded and executed, the parties to the transaction reflected in a recorded document, and the document's legally operative language, assuming there is no genuine dispute regarding the document's authenticity. From this, the court may deduce and rely upon the legal effect of the recorded document, when that effect is clear from its face.” (Scott v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 743, 745-755.)  Taking judicial notice of a document is not the same as accepting the truth of its contents or accepting a particular interpretation of its meaning. (Fremont Indem. Co. v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 113-14 (citations and internal quotations omitted).) In addition, judges “consider matters shown in exhibits attached to the complaint and incorporated by reference.”  (Performance Plastering v. Richmond American Homes of California, Inc. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 659, 665.)  However, “[w]hen judicial notice is taken of a document . . . the truthfulness and proper interpretation of the document are disputable.” (Aquila, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 556, 569 (quoting StorMedia Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 449, 457 n. 9).) Defendant requests that the Court take judicial notice of (1) reports prepared by the Department of Transportation publicly submitted to City Council during a public hearing on September 11, 2017 and December 13, 2017 and (2) City Council’s action at its January 12, 2018 regular meeting. The requests are GRANTED.Plaintiff objects to Defendant’s requests for judicial notice on the grounds that the Court should not consider exhibits attached to Defendant’s motion that are subject to dispute. The objections are overruled because the matters are judicially noticeable under Evid. Code, section 452 as official acts of a city. (See Trinity Park, L.P. v. City of Sunnyvale (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 1014, 1027, disapproved of on other grounds by Sterling Park, L.P. v. City of Palo Alto (2013) 57 Cal.4th 1193.) Additionally, Plaintiff does not allege that the documents are not authentic. Although Plaintiff also argues that the Court may not take judicial notice of the truth of the matters asserted in these documents, the Court may take judicial notice of their legal effect and other matters not reasonably subject to dispute which are capable of immediate and accurate determination.Defendant on reply makes a second request for judicial notice of (1) Google Maps street view images, and (2) various Los Angeles Municipal Code sections. The Google Maps images are not matters which may be judicially noticed. Additionally, the municipal code sections are not pertinent to the Court’s decision, as will be explained below. Therefore, both requests are denied.DiscussionThe Coastal Act of 1976 (Pub. Res. Code, section 30000 et seq.) (“Coastal Act” or “Act”) is the legislative continuation of the coastal protection efforts commenced when the People passed Proposition 20, the 1972 initiative that created the Coastal Commission.  (See Ibarra v. California Coastal Comm., (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 687, 693.) One of the primary purposes of the Coastal Act is the avoidance of deleterious consequences of development on coastal resources.  (Pacific Legal Foundation v. California Coastal Comm., (1982) 33 Cal.3d 158, 163.) The Supreme Court described the Coastal Act as a comprehensive scheme to govern land use planning for the entire coastal zone of California. (Yost v. Thomas, (1984) 36 Cal.3d 561, 565.) The Act must be liberally construed to accomplish its purposes and objectives.  §30009. The Coastal Act’s goals are binding on both the Commission and local government and include: (1) maximizing, expanding and maintaining public access to the coast and coastal zone (Sections 30210-30214); (2) expanding and protecting public recreation opportunities (Sections 30220-30224); (3) protecting and enhancing marine resources including biotic life (sections 30230-30237); and (4) protecting and enhancing land resources (Sections 30240-30244).  The supremacy of these statewide policies over local, parochial concerns is a primary purpose of the Coastal Act, and the Commission is therefore given the ultimate authority under the Act and its interpretation. (Pratt Construction Co. v. California Coastal Comm., (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1068, 107576.)1. Whether Plaintiff’s claims are time-barredPlaintiff alleges that Defendant, in response to the dangerous condition of the subject roadway at Vista Del Mar, a road running parallel to Dockweiler Beach from Imperial Highway to Napoleon Street, began prohibiting parking for nine miles along the street. (Compl., ¶12.) Defendant failed to apply to the Commission for permission to remove such a large area of beach access and failed to obtain a coastal development permit. (Compl., ¶13.) On October 16, 2019, an officer of the Commission issued a letter to Defendant stating Defendant was in violation of section 30600(b) of the Coastal Act. (Id.) The Commission intended to work with Defendant to issue the required permits and review Defendant’s development plans, but noted it had the power to assess a daily administrative penalty of $11,250 under section 30821. (Id.) Although Defendant represented it would work with the Commission to obtain the necessary permits, Defendant and the Commission have not dealt with Defendant’s violations of the Coastal Act. (Compl., ¶14.)Applicable Statute of LimitationsDefendant argues that Plaintiff’s claims are time-barred under Code Civ. Proc., section 338.Code Civ. Proc., section 338, subd. (a) provides that an action on a liability created by statute must be brought within three years of its accrual.Here, there is no dispute that the 400 parking spaces were removed from the Subject Roadway in 2017. There is also no dispute that this lawsuit was filed on November 6, 2023.There is no doubt that pursuant to Section 30821(a) of the Public Resources Code the California Coast Commission has the authority to impose penalties for each day that a violation of the California Coastal Act persists for up to five years. This Section however does not provide for a private right of action to seek such penalties through a suit such as this one.Plaintiff contends that Defendant’s continued enforcement of the no parking restrictions on the Subject Roadway through tickets makes the violation ongoing and thus within the statute of limitations.Plaintiff also contends that the delayed discovery rule is at play here and hence the statute of limitations was tolled. Because this action concerns a liability created by the Coastal Act and no other more specific statute of limitations applies, the Court finds the applicable statute of limitations is three years under Code Civ. Proc., section 338, subd. (a).Plaintiff in opposition argues that there are many cases filed by the Commission and others for equitable relief and enforcement of the Coastal Act because violations of the Act are treated as daily violations of Pub. Res. Code, section 30821.After public hearing, if the Commission determines any person has undertaken or is threatening to undertake any activity that (1) requires a permit from the Commission without securing said permit or (2) is inconsistent with any permit previously issued by the Commission, the Commission may issue an order directing that person to cease and desist. (Section 30810(a).)  The cease and desist order may be subject to such terms and conditions as the Commission may determine are necessary to ensure compliance with the Act, including immediate removal of any development or the setting of a schedule within which steps shall be taken to obtain a permit. (Section 30810(b).)In 2014, the California Legislature enacted section 30821, which enables the Commission to impose an administrative civil penalty on persons who violate public access provisions of the Act. (Section 30821(a).)  The penalty may be assessed for each day that the violation persists, but for no more than five years. (Id.) The amount of the penalty per violation may not exceed 75 percent of $15,000 per day. (Id.)Here, as Defendant points out, only the Commission has the power to issue penalties under section 30821. Because Plaintiff lacks standing to bring an action under 30821, Defendant’s violations under 30821 are not relevant to determining when the statute of limitations began to accrue. Continuous AccrualUnder the continuous accrual theory, a cause of action is subject to a continuous accrual of a cause of action each time a wrongful act occurs for purposes of application of the statute of limitations. (Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Ass’n v. City of La Habra (2001) 24 Cal.4th 809, 821; Aryeh v. Canon Business Solutions, Inc. (2013) 55 Cal.4th 1185, 1198-1199.)Here, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant continues to enforce the unlawful parking prohibitions on the Subject Road which restrict the public’s access to the beach. (Complaint ¶¶ 39-40.)The motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied as to this ground.2. Whether Plaintiff was required to file a writ of mandate in lieu of this action.Defendant next argues that this action must be dismissed because it was filed under the wrong statute and must be pursued via a writ of mandate.Pub. Res. Code, Section 30801 provides that any aggrieved person shall have a right to judicial review of any decision or action of the commission by filing a petition for a writ of mandate in accordance with Code Civ. Proc., section 1094.5 within 60 days after the commission’s decision or action becomes final. An aggrieved person is someone who appeared at a public hearing of the commission, local government, or port governing body in connection with the Commission’s decision. (Id., subd. (b).)“Any person may maintain an action for declaratory and equitable relief to restrain any violation of this division, of a cease and desist order issued pursuant to Section 30809 or 30810, or of a restoration order issued pursuant to Section 30811. On a prima facie showing of a violation of this division, preliminary equitable relief shall be issued to restrain any further violation of this division. No bond shall be required for an action under this section.” (Pub. Res. Code, Section 30803.)“Any person may maintain an action to enforce the duties specifically imposed upon the commission, any governmental agency, any special district, or any local government by this division. No bond shall be required for an action under this section.” (Pub. Res. Code, Section 30804.)Any person may maintain an action for declaratory and equitable relief. Although Plaintiff would be required to file a writ of mandate if he was challenging an action or decision of the Commission, he is not seeking such relief here. Instead, Plaintiff is directly suing to stop Defendant from further violating the California Coastal Act. Plaintiff’s action is expressly permitted under the Act. The case cited by Defendant, Pacific Legal Foundation v. California Costal Com. (1982) states that section 30804 “appears designed in part to make traditional mandamus available to enforce ministerial duties imposed on the Commission by Coastal Act.” Defendant produces no authority holding that a writ of mandate is the exclusive remedy under section 30804 which Plaintiff purports to rely upon. Defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings is overruled on this ground.3. Taxpayer WasteDefendant also argues that the cause of action for taxpayer waste must be dismissed because it is derivative of the Coastal Act claim stated in the second cause of action. Code of Civil Procedure section 526a provides: “An action to obtain a judgment, restraining and preventing any illegal expenditure of, waste of, or injury to, the estate, funds, or other property of a local agency, may be maintained against any officer thereof, or any agent, or other person, acting in its behalf, either by a resident therein, or by a corporation, who is assessed for and is liable to pay, or, within one year before the commencement of the action, has paid, a tax that funds the defendant local agency . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., section 526a.) The purpose of the statute is “to permit a large body of persons to challenge wasteful government action that otherwise would go unchallenged because of the standing requirement.” (Thompson v. City of Petaluma (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 101, 105.) “To invoke taxpayer standing, however, the challenged governmental conduct must be illegal [citation] or must constitute waste.” (Id.) The term “waste” means “something more than an alleged mistake by public officials in matters involving the exercise of judgment or wide discretion. To hold otherwise would invite constant harassment of city and county officers by disgruntled citizens and could seriously hamper our representative form of government at the local level. Thus, the courts should not take judicial cognizance of disputes which are primarily political in nature, nor should they attempt to enjoin every expenditure which does not meet with a taxpayer's approval. On the other hand, a court must not close its eyes to wasteful, improvident and completely unnecessary public spending, merely because it is done in the exercise of a lawful power.” (Sundance v. Municipal Court (1986) 42 Cal.3d 1101, 1138–1139 (citing City of Ceres v. City of Modesto (1969) 274 Cal.App.2d 545, 555).) “Courts should not interfere with a local government's legislative judgment on the ground that its funds could be spent more efficiently.”  (Thompson, supra, 231 Cal.App.4th at 106.)   Here, Defendant reiterates its argument that this cause of action is time-barred because it began accruing when Defendant removed its parking spaces over six years ago. For the same reasons, the motion is denied on this basis. DATED: May 16, 2024__________________________Hon. Jill Feeney Judge of the Superior Court
