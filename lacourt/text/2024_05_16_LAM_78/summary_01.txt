Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, City of Los Angeles, has moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the plaintiff's claims are time-barred and that the plaintiff was required to file a writ of mandate in lieu of this action. The court has denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings on both grounds.

The plaintiff, Joseph Roesler, alleges that the defendant removed parking spaces on Vista Del Mar road without obtaining a coastal development permit from the California Coastal Commission, in violation of the California Coastal Act. The plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to stop the defendant from further violating the act.

The court has found that the plaintiff's claims are not time-barred, as the removal of the parking spaces in 2017 is a continuing violation of the act. The court has also held that the plaintiff was not required to file a writ of mandate in lieu of this action, as the plaintiff is seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to stop the defendant from further violating the act.

Finally, the court has denied the defendant's motion to dismiss the plaintiff's cause of action for taxpayer waste, as the plaintiff has alleged a violation of the California Coastal Act and has shown that the defendant's actions constitute waste.
