Summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ani Yapunjyan v. Wawanesa General Insurance Company. The case involves a motor vehicle collision and an insurance claim denial. The plaintiff, Ani Yapunjyan, filed a complaint alleging breach of insurance contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The defendant, Wawanesa General Insurance Company, demurred to the complaint, arguing that the causes of action are time-barred.

The court held that the statute of limitations for the plaintiff's causes of action was tolled during the COVID-19 pandemic and that the plaintiff's claims are timely. The court also granted the defendant's request for judicial notice of the existence of the denial letter, the date of the letter, the names in the letter, and the letter's effect.

The court's ruling is a tentative ruling and is subject to change after further briefing and argument.
