And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motions to compel responses to special interrogatories, form interrogatories, and requests for production of documents filed by Teresita N. Sood against Mahesh C. Sood. The motions were unopposed and the judge found that Mahesh failed to respond to the discovery requests despite being properly served and having the time to respond.

The judge also granted Teresita's request for sanctions against Mahesh in the amount of $992.00. The sanctions are payable within 30 days of service of the order. The judge reduced the amount of sanctions from $1,510.00 to $992.00 after reviewing the calculations provided by Teresita's attorney and making adjustments for duplication of time and unnecessary expenses.

The case involves a dispute between co-owners of a real property, Mahesh and Teresita, over Mahesh's demand for partition of the property and recovery of his costs. Mahesh spent over $100,000.00 on the property, but Teresita refused to pay her share of the costs. Mahesh filed a complaint against Teresita and the other defendants, seeking partition of the property, restitution of 50% of the money he spent on the property, attorney's fees, and costs.
