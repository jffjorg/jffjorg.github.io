Defendants Health Net of California, Inc. and Centene
Corporation (hereinafter “Defendants”) filed a demurrer and motion to strike
the SAC. Plaintiff opposes the Motion. The matter is now before the court. 
 
LEGAL STANDARDS
A.        Demurrer 
 
A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(CCP, § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d
311, 318.)¿“To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts
sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might
eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.”¿(C.A. v.
William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th
861, 872.)¿For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the
demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded.¿ (Aubry v.
Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.)¿A demurrer “does
not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.”¿(Daar v.
Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿ 
 
B.        Motion to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP, § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP, § 436(a)-(b);
Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading
which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are
surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
C.        Leave to Amend 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally granted
to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
Demurrer[1]
 
I.         Request for Judicial Notice 
 
The court may
take judicial notice of “official acts of the legislative, executive, and
judicial departments of the United States and of any state of the United
States,” “[r]ecords of (1) any court of this state or (2) any court of record
of the United States or of any state of the United States,” and “[f]acts and
propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of
immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably
indisputable accuracy.” (Evid. Code § 452, subds. (c), (d), and (h).) “Taking
judicial notice of a document is not the same as accepting the truth of its
contents or accepting a particular interpretation of its meaning.” (Joslin v. H.A.S. Ins. Brokerage (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 369, 374.)
 
Defendants request judicial notice of the following: 
 
1)    
Exhibit 1:
A true and correct copy of Plaintiff’s Department of Fair Employment and
Housing (“DFEH”) Complaint of Discrimination Under the Provisions of the
California Fair Employment and Housing Act (“DFEH Complaint”) filed with the
DFEH on September 6, 2022.
 
2)    
Exhibit 2:
A true and correct copy of the letter from the DFEH to Plaintiff enclosing
Plaintiff’s Complaint of Discrimination Under the Provisions of the California
Fair Employment and Housing Act filed with the DFEH and the DFEH’s Right to Sue
Letter addressed to Plaintiff in response to her DFEH Complaint, dated
September 6, 2022.
 
3)    
Exhibit 3:
A true and correct copy of the DFEH’s Right to Sue Letter addressed to
Plaintiff in response to her DFEH Complaint, dated September 6, 2022.
 
4)    
Exhibit 4:
A true and correct copy of Gov. Code § 12960 effective January 1, 2018 to
December 31, 2019. 
 
Defendants’ request for judicial notice is granted. 
 
II.        Discussion 
 
A.        Facts Alleged in the Complaint
 
Plaintiff
began working for Defendants around 1996. (SAC, ¶ 11.) Plaintiff alleges that
in or around 2019, a co-worker Donna Thompson began to harass Plaintiff by
taking photos and videos of her. (Id., ¶ 15(b).) Plaintiff also asserts
she experienced harassing behavior from her supervisor, Catherin Brontis
(“Brontis”). (Id., ¶ 15(c)-(d).) 
 
In
2019 and 2020, Plaintiff’s neck, back, and shoulder pain became worse, and
Plaintiff requested medical leave. 
Defendants initially granted the leave until Brontis informed Plaintiff
that additional documentation was needed. 
When Plaintiff tried to provide the information, she was informed she
was not in Defendants’ system. (SAC, ¶ 15(h)-(i). Plaintiff was told that she
needed FMLA approval to get back in the system. (Id., ¶ 15(i).) In
October 2021, Plaintiff finally received the FMLA paperwork she had requested
from Defendants to apply for FMLA leave. (Id., ¶ 16.) Plaintiff
submitted the FMLA paperwork but was told it was not approved because she had
been terminated. (Id., ¶ 17.) 
 
Plaintiff
has now brought this action seeking damages. Defendants demur to the SAC as
follows: 
 
B.        Failure to
Exhaust Administrative Remedies 
 
Defendants
assert that Plaintiff’s DFEH charge failed to follow the pleading requirements
outlined in Cal. Code Regs. 2, § 10005(d)(3) & (4) and instead asserted
legal conclusions in her DFEH charge without any facts to support the
allegations asserted. 
 
An
employee must file an administrative complaint with the Department of Fair
Employment and Housing within three years from the date the alleged unlawful
action occurred, and he or she must file suit within one year of a right-to-sue
letter.  (Govt. Code, §§ 12960(e), 12965(b).) The charge filed with the
DFEH must “set forth the particulars” of the unlawful employment
practice. (Gov. Code, § 12960(c).) The California Code of Regulations
describes the requirements for obtaining a right-to-sue letter: 
 
(d) To obtain an immediate
right-to-sue notice via the department's automated right-to-sue system or by
submitting a completed right-to-sue notice packet to the department, an
aggrieved person shall file a right-to-sue complaint with the department containing
the following:
 
(1) complainant's name and,
where available, address, telephone number and e-mail address;
 
(2) respondent's name, address
and, where available, telephone number and e-mail address. If applicable, the
job title and/or capacity in which the respondent is being named also shall be
included;
 
(3) a description of the
alleged act or acts of discrimination, harassment or retaliation;
 
(4) the date or dates each
alleged act of discrimination, harassment or retaliation occurred, including
the date of the last or most recent alleged act;
 
(5) each protected basis upon
which the alleged discrimination or harassment was based;
 
(6) for retaliation complaints,
the date and type of protected activity in which the complainant engaged;
 
(7) the complainant's
declaration, made under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of
California, that to the best of the complainant's knowledge all information
stated is true and correct, except matters stated on information and belief,
which the complainant believes to be true;
 
(8) the signature of the
complainant, or an authorized signature, and the date signed, unless the
complaint is filed electronically[.]
 
(Cal.
Code Regs., tit. 2, § 10005(d).) 
 
Defendants
assert that Plaintiff’s DFEH charge is insufficiently pled because Plaintiff
asserted only conclusory legal statements without facts to support the alleged
FEHA violations. Defendants point out that “the DFEH does not review or edit
the complaint form to ensure that it meets procedural or statutory
requirements.” (RJN, Ex. 2.)
 
Plaintiff’s
DFEH charge states “that on or about September 7, 2021, respondent took
the following adverse actions” harassment and discrimination “because of
complainant’s. . . disability (physical or mental), medical condition (cancer
or genetic characteristic), other, family care or medical leave (cfra). (RJN,
Ex. 1 at p. 2 [bold original].)  “Complainant
experienced retaliation because complainant . . . participated as a witness
in a discrimination or harassment complaint, requested or used family care or
medical leave (cfra) and as a result was terminated, reprimanded, denied any
employment benefit or privilege, denied accommodation for religious beliefs,
other, denied work opportunities or assignments, denied family care or medical
leave (cfra).” (Id. [bold original].) The DFEH also included the name
and address of the entity Defendants. (Id.) 
 
Defendants
fail to show what facts are missing that do not give Defendants notice of the
FEHA charges alleged against them. In Wills v. Superior Court (2011) 195
Cal.App.4th 143, the appellate court found that the employee’s DFEH
administrative complaint was deficient as to the harassment claims because the harassment
claim was not included in the DFEH complaint. (Id., at p. 157.) “A claim
the OC Court discriminated against Wills by firing her based on her mental
disability is distinct and different in nature from a claim Wills's coworkers
harassed her during her employment[.]” (Ibid.) Similarly in Okoli v.
Lockheed Technical Operations Co. (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1607, the appellate
court found that the employee failed to exhaust his administrative claims
because the claims were not like or reasonably related to those alleged in the
DFEH charge. (Id., at p. 1617 [“Since Okoli's complaint added claims
that were neither like nor reasonably related to his DFEH claim and were not
likely to be uncovered in the course of a DFEH investigation, his retaliation
claim is barred by the exhaustion of remedies doctrine.”].) 
 
The
rule is “[t]he administrative exhaustion requirement is satisfied if FEHA
claims in a judicial complaint are ‘like and reasonably related to’ those in
the DFEH complaint [citation] or ‘likely to be uncovered in the course of a
DFEH investigation’ [Citation.]” (Clark v. Superior Court (2021) 62
Cal.App.5th 289, 302; see also Guzman v. NBA Automotive, Inc. (2021) 68
Cal.App.5th 1109, 1118.) Having reviewed the Plaintiff’s DFEH charge, the court
finds that it sets “forth the particulars” of her FEHA claim. (Gov. Code,
§ 12960(c).) Defendants have not cited any case law, and the court is aware of
no authority, that imposes a heightened pleading standard on DFEH charges that
require employees to plead specific facts for the DFEH charge to be validly
“pled.” In the absence of such authority, the court will not impose heightened
pleading standards on DFEH administrative complaints when the legislature and
the DFEH have declined to do so. 
 
Therefore,
the demurrer is overruled on the basis that Plaintiff’s DFEH charge is
deficiently pled and she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. 
 
C.        9th, 10th, and 12th Causes of Action -
Derivative Causes of Action and Preemption Under Workers’ Compensation Act
 
Defendants
assert that Plaintiff’s 9th, 10th, and 12th causes of action—for negligent
hiring, supervision, and retention, wrongful termination, and IIED—fail as they
are derivative of her FEHA causes of action. Defendants cite Jennings v.
Marralle (1994) 8 Cal.4th 121, 136[2]
and TRW, Inc. v. Superior Court (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1834 for the
proposition that when a FEHA claim fails there can be no claim for negligence,
wrongful termination, or IIED since there is no underlying wrongful conduct.
Having reviewed Jennings and TRW, Inc., the Defendants’
proposition is not supported by case law. Moreover, Defendants have failed to
show that Plaintiff’s FEHA claims are improperly pled. 
 
The
demurrer on this basis is overruled. 
 
Defendants
also assert that the 9th, 10th, and 12th causes of action are preempted by the
California Workers’ Compensation Act because the claims arise out of the
employment relationship. “Where the acts are a normal part of the employment
relationship or workers’ compensation process, or where the motive behind the
acts does not violate a fundamental policy of this state, then the cause of
action is barred” by the workers’ compensation exclusivity bar. (Charles J.
Vacanti, M.D., Inc. v. State Comp. Ins. Fund (2001) 24 Cal.4th 800, 812
[internal citations omitted].) “But some claims, including those based on
sexual or racial discrimination or other conduct contrary to fundamental public
policy, are not subject to the exclusivity provisions of the workers' compensation
law.” (Claxton v. Waters (2004) 34 Cal.4th 367, 373.) 
 
Discrimination
and harassment claims are not a normal incident of the employment relationship,
and a claim for damages under FEHA would not be barred by the exclusive remedy
provisions of the Workers’ Compensation Act. (See Accardi v. Superior Court  (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 341, 347.) The
Legislature “did not intend that its objective of providing relief from civil
rights violations would be defeated by the exclusive remedy provision of the
Workers' Compensation Act.” (Flait v. North American Watch Corp. (1992)
3 Cal.App.4th 467, 480.) 
 
Because
the 9th, 10th, and 12th causes of action arise out of conduct that is
statutorily prohibited, these claims exist outside of the employment
environment since they are not a normal part of the employment relationship.
Therefore, the 9th, 10th, and 12th causes of action are not prohibited by the
exclusive remedies of the Workers’ Compensation Act. (See Accardi, supra,
17 Cal.App.4th at p. 347; Light v. Department of Parks & Recreation (2017)
14 Cal.App.5th 75, 101; Cornell v. Berkeley Tennis Club (2017) 18
Cal.App.5th 908, 945–946.) 
 
Lastly,
whether the Defendants' conduct arouse out of routine personnel action and is
not extreme or outrageous remains a triable issue of fact given Plaintiff’s
harassment and discrimination claims.  
 
Therefore,
the demurrer to the 9th, 10th, and 12th causes of action is overruled. 
 
D.        11th Cause of Action - Whistleblower
Retaliation (Lab. Code § 1102.5.)
 
To
establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Labor Code § 1102.5, “a
plaintiff must show that (1) he engaged in a protected activity, (2) his
employer subjected him to an adverse employment action, and (3) there is a
causal connection between the two.” (Mokler v. County of Orange (2007)
157 Cal.App.4th 121, 138.)
 
Defendants assert the 11th cause of action is
insufficiently pled because it is conclusory and fails to assert facts showing
that Plaintiff reported or complained about any violation of law to Defendants
or to her supervisors, what law was complained about, and when the complaint
was made. 
 
Plaintiff asserts that her whistleblower retaliation
claim is sufficiently pled because she alleges that Defendants retaliated
against her because she inquired about her medical leave. (SAC, ¶¶ 15(i), 16,
20.) 
 
The court notes that a retaliation claim under Lab.
Code § 1102.5 is statutorily different from FEHA retaliation claims. (Glynn
v. Superior Court (2019) 42 Cal.App.5th 47, 55.) As explained by the
California Supreme Court, Labor Code § 1102.5 “prohibits an employer from retaliating
against an employee for sharing information the employee ‘has reasonable cause
to believe ... discloses a violation of state or federal statute’ or of ‘a
local, state, or federal rule or regulation’ with a government agency, with a
person with authority over the employee, or with another employee who has
authority to investigate or correct the violation.” (Lawson v. PPG
Architectural Finishes, Inc. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 703, 709.)
 
Plaintiff needs to allege that she was retaliated
against because she disclosed a legal violation to a government agency or
person with authority over Plaintiff and/or with authority to investigate or
correct the violation. Plaintiff does not allege that she informed a supervisor
or someone with authority about the Defendants’ not approving her medical leave
in violation of her statutory rights. 
 
Therefore, the demurrer to the eleventh cause of
action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
            E.        1st and 2nd Cause of Action – Discrimination and Harassment
 
The court overrules the demurrer to the second and
third cause of action on the basis that Plaintiff's harassment and
discrimination claims based on religion are barred by the statute of
limitations. “A demurrer cannot rightfully be sustained to part of a cause of
action or to a particular type of damage or remedy.” (Kong v. City of
Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency (2002) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1047.)
The first and second causes of action are also premised on discrimination and
harassment based on Plaintiff’s disability, and Defendants cannot dispose of
the entire cause of action on demurrer. 
Lastly, Plaintiff’s opposition states “Plaintiff intends to dismiss her
claims for Discrimination based on Religion and Harassment based on Religion.”
(Opp. at p. 1:12-13.) 
 
Motion to Strike
 
Defendants
move to strike references to religion on the basis that any events
alleged to have occurred in 2019 are barred by DFEH’s 3-year statute of
limitations. (SAC, ¶ 15(a).) Defendants also seek to strike references to
religious discrimination and harassment and other allegations Defendant deems improper
as alleged in Paragraph 15 of the Complaint. Plaintiff has failed to oppose the
motion to strike and explain why the allegations are relevant to her claim for
disability discrimination and violation of CFRA. 
The court
grants the motion to strike without leave to amend as follows: 
·      
Line 2 at page 9:
“Religion” 
·      
Line 15 at page 9:
“religion”
·      
Line 16 at page 10:
“Religion
·      
Line 1 at page 11:
“religion”
·      
¶ 15 (a) at page 4:
“Beginning in or around 2019 and continuing throughout her employment,
Defendants required employees in Brown’s department to work on Sundays.”
·      
¶ 15 (a) at page 4: “Brown
informed her Manager, Sandra Cruz ("Cruz"), that she could not work
on Sundays because she had to go to church.” 
·      
15 (a) at page 4: “Cruz
insisted that Brown work the night shift on Sundays; however, Brown informed
her that she attends church both, during the day and at night.” 
·      
¶ 15 (a) at page 4:
“Despite this, Cruz told Brown she had to figure out a way to work through it.”
·      
¶ 15 (a) at page 4: “Brown
felt she had no choice but to work on Sundays and, thus, missed church to do so
on a consistent basis.”
 
The court
grants the motion to strike the following with leave to amend: 
·      
¶ 15 (b) at page 4: “In or
around 2019, Brown began making complaints regarding a co-worker, Donna
Thompson ("Thompson"), being aggressive with her.” 
·      
¶ 15 (b) at page 4: “This
was not the first time Thompson acted this way in the workplace, as other
employees had also had negative experiences with her.”
·      
¶ 15 (b) at page 4:
“However, despite Brown and other employees complaining about Thompson's
behavior, nothing was done.”
·      
¶ 15 (b) at page 4: “On
another occasion, Thompson began harassing Brown by taking photos and videos of
her, which made Brown very uncomfortable.” 
·      
¶ 15 (b) at page 4: “Brown
and other employees again complained to supervisor Sheila Moore (“Moore”) and
Cruz, stating that they were fearful of their safety given Thompson's
aggressive and harassing behavior.” 
·      
¶ 15 (b) at page 5:
“However, again, nothing was done.”
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants’ demurrer is sustained with leave to amend as the
eleventh cause of action, and is otherwise overruled. The motion to strike is
granted without leave to amend as to references to the word religion and the
allegations on Paragraph 15(a) of the SAC, as outlined above. The motion to
strike is otherwise granted with leave to amend. Plaintiff is granted
10 days leave to amend. The court sets the OSC RE: Amended Complaint for October
22, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Defendants to give notice.
