And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication against the defendant, J Baron Construction, Inc. The plaintiff, Kimberly Kim, alleged that the defendant breached their contract and committed fraud in regards to a remodeling project on her condominium. However, the judge found that the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove all elements of her breach of contract claim, including evidence of payment to the defendant. Additionally, the judge found that the plaintiff failed to specifically set forth the purported misrepresentations made by the defendant and failed to provide evidence of the defendant's authority to make such representations. As a result, the judge denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication as to both causes of action.
