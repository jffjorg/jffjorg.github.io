And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is continuing the hearing to allow Cross-Complainant Louis Correll to submit supplemental evidence. The Judge notes that Cross-Complainant has failed to file a dismissal of the Doe defendants named in the cross-complaint, as required by rule 3.1800(a)(7) of the California Code of Civil Procedure. Additionally, Cross-Complainant's request for attorney fees does not comply with the schedule set forth in Superior Court of Los Angeles County, Local Rules, rule 3.214(a).

The Judge also finds that Cross-Complainant has failed to sufficiently describe why he is entitled to $29,839 in damages. Cross-Complainant must either reduce the amount of damages sought or explain why he is entitled to $10,000 in diminution of value damages. Finally, the Judge notes that the nature of Cross-Complainant's purported loss for the change in size of the pool is not clear to the Court, and that Cross-Complainant must file a dismissal of the Doe defendants before the default judgment can be granted.
