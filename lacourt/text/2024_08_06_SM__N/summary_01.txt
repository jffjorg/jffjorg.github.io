Here's a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Shahnaz Levyim and Desiree Levyim, have demurred to the third, fourth, and eighth causes of action in the plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint. The court has sustained the demurrer with 30 days' leave to amend as to the third, fourth, and eighth causes of action. The plaintiffs, Cornell Gillenwater and Bret Kadel, may amend their complaint only as authorized by the court's order and may not add a new party or cause of action without permission.

The court has also granted the defendants' request for judicial notice of its own ruling as to the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiffs' initial complaint.

The court has found that the plaintiffs have failed to allege specific facts that support a finding of conspiracy, and that the allegations of fraud and conspiracy are insufficient. The court has also found that the eighth cause of action, alleging an accounting, is defective and has sustained the demurrer to that cause of action with 30 days' leave to amend.

The court has cited various California cases in support of its ruling, including Harris v. Wachovia Mortgage, FSB, Lewis v. Safeway, Inc., and Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
