And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Petitioner, Meyer, Olson, Lowy & Meyers, LLP, has moved to compel binding arbitration and the appointment of an arbitrator to resolve a dispute over fees with the Respondent, Dominique Harris. The dispute arises from a written agreement entered into on September 14, 2020, which includes an arbitration clause. The Petitioner has demonstrated that the agreement is valid and that the dispute is covered by the arbitration clause. Since the Respondent has failed to oppose the petition, the Court has no grounds to conclude that there is a defense to enforcement of the provision. The Court grants the Petitioner's motion and orders the parties to submit four proposed arbitrators. An arbitrator will be randomly drawn and appointed by the Court to arbitrate the action. The proceedings are stayed pending the conclusion of arbitration.
