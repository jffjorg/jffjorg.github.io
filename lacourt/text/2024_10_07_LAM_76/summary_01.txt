And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the case and is now issuing a tentative ruling. The defendant, Lichtman, did not meet and confer with the plaintiff, Vanessa Poydras, as required by law. Additionally, Lichtman did not serve the plaintiff with the demurrer and motion to strike. The plaintiff has opposed the demurrer and motion to strike, stating that they were never properly served and that no meet and confer effort occurred. The court has continued the hearing multiple times, ordering the defendant to file proof of service and a meet and confer declaration. Despite this, the defendant has not complied with the court's orders. As a result, the demurrer and motion to strike are being placed off-calendar, and the defendant is ordered to answer the complaint within 10 days.
