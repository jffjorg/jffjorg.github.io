Legal Standard
 
A demurrer tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and
Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.) In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face
of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court
(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p. 747.) The
ultimate facts alleged in the complaint must be deemed true, as well as all
facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged. (Marshall
v. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403; see also Shields
v. County of San Diego (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 103, 133 [stating, “[o]n
demurrer, pleadings are read liberally and allegations contained therein are
assumed to be true”].) “This rule of liberal construction means that the
reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not the
defendant.” (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th
1228, 1238.) 
 
Meet and Confer
 
Before filing a demurrer, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party
who has filed the pleading subject to the demurrer and file a declaration
detailing their meet and confer efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a).)
However, an insufficient meet-and-confer process is not grounds
to overrule or sustain a demurrer.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41(a)(4).)
 
The Declaration of Ryan Miller,
counsel for Defendant, states that counsel for the parties met and conferred
telephonically on February 19, 2024. (Declaration of Ryan D. Miller ISO
Demurrer ¶ 2.) Although the parties were able to reach an agreement regarding
other causes of action asserted in the Second Amended Complaint, they were not
able to resolve the disputes raised in this demurrer. (Id; see also
Exhs. 1-2.) Defendant has therefore satisfied its statutory meet-and-confer obligations.

 
Defendant’s Withdrawn Argument
 
            Defendant’s
moving papers asserted that Plaintiff’s claims for negligence and negligent
supervision are deficient because Plaintiff failed to present a claim for
damages pursuant to the Government Tort Claims Act. (See Gov. Code § 945.4.) The
Legislature added a prospective exemption to this requirement for childhood
sexual abuse claims arising on or after the effective date of that amendment,
January 1, 2009. (See Rubenstein v. Doe No. 1 (2017) 3 Cal.5th 903, 913
[describing the amendment].) The 2019 amendments to the Government Tort Claims
Act eliminated the temporal limitation to the exemption, thereby exempting all
childhood sexual abuse claims from the claim presentation requirement. (See
Stat. 2019 Ch. 861 § 1.) This amendment is retroactive and expressly revives
claims that would have previously been barred. (Gov. Code § 905(p).) Defendant’s
moving papers argued that this retroactive change is an unconstitutional gift of
public funds in violation of Article XVI, section 6 of the California
Constitution. However, during the time this demurrer was pending, the Court of
Appeal published its opinion in West Contra Costa Unified School District v.
Superior Court of Contra Costa County (Cal. Ct. App., July 31, 2024, No.
A169314) 2024 WL 3593932. In that opinion, the Court of Appeal categorically
rejects the argument raised in the moving papers, holding that (1) the claim
presentation requirement is a condition imposed on the State’s consent to be
sued and does not create substantive liability (Id. at *19-*20), and (2)
the amendment was made for a public purpose and therefore is not a gift. (Id.
at *32-*33.) Defendant acknowledged the controlling effect of this ruling in
its reply papers and withdrew the argument.
 
            As Defendant
has withdrawn this argument, the Court need not decide the matter here, and,
even if it had not been withdrawn, the Court would be obligated to follow West
Contra Costa Unified School District as the controlling authority on this
issue. As matters stand, the Court simply notes that the above recitation
reflects the current state of the law.
 
First Cause of Action: Negligence
 
            Defendant
demurs to the first cause of action for negligence for failure to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action. 
 
            The
well-established elements of a cause of action for negligence are “(a) a legal
duty to use due care; (b) a breach of such legal duty; [and] (c) the breach as
proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury.” (Ladd v. County of San
Mateo (1996) 12 Cal.4th 913, 917.) With respect to injuries caused by third
parties, there ordinarily exists “no duty to protect others from the conduct of
third parties.” (Regents of University of California v. Superior Court
(2018) 4 Cal.5th 607, 627; Brown v. USA Taekwondo (2021) 11 Cal.5th 204,
209.) However, a duty to protect others from third parties exists where the
person is in a “special relationship” with either the victim or the person who
created the harm. (Brown, supra, 11 Cal.5th at 215.) School districts
have a “special relationship” for the purpose of this analysis with both their
employees and their students. (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School
Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 869.) 
 
            Defendant
contends that it owes no duty to Plaintiff because he was a former student,
rather than a current student. As Defendant concedes, a school district stands in
loco parentis with respect to its students, and therefore is vested with
similar powers and responsibilities. (In re Christopher W. (1973) 29
Cal.App.3d 777, 780-81.) However, a school district owes no special duty to
non-students. (See Hoff v. Vacaville Unified School District (1998) 19
Cal.4th 925, 936 [plaintiff was not a student at the time of the injury]; Austin
B. v. Escondido Union School Dist. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 860, 874
[describing general principle that school owes duty to students, but not others,
by standing in loco parentis].) 
 
            Defendant
contends that Plaintiff admits that he has no special relationship with Los
Angeles Unified School District because he acknowledges that he was a “former
student” at the time of the alleged conduct in paragraph 13 of the Second
Amended Complaint. This characterization misstates the allegations in the
pleadings. Plaintiff alleges that Plaintiff would periodically visit his
elementary school, Saturn Street Elementary School, after his graduation from
Saturn Street Elementary, but while still a minor. (See SAC ¶¶ 13, 16.)
Plaintiff alleges that during these visits, beginning in 1982, when he was 12
years old, and continuing through 1988, he was sexually harassed and abused by
a janitor employed at Saturn Street Elementary. (SAC ¶¶ 16-20.) 
 
Although Defendant makes much of
the allegation in paragraph 13 that “at all times . . . Plaintiff was a former
student at LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT and SATURN STREET ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL,” that statement, taken in context, appears to refer to his status as a
graduate of Saturn Street Elementary School, befitting Plaintiff’s age at the
time, and does not state that he was no longer a student within the Los Angeles
Unified School District. That said, Plaintiff concedes that the Second Amended
Complaint does not expressly allege the reverse—i.e., that Plaintiff was a
student attending another school within the District. While Plaintiff makes
note of materials produced in discovery relating to that issue, those materials
are extrinsic to the pleadings and may not be considered on demurrer. (See Hahn,
supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p. 747.) However, construing the allegations
liberally, as required on a demurrer, the Court finds that the Second Amended
Complaint adequately alleges a special relationship in that it supports the
inference that Plaintiff was a then-current student within the District as a
whole. 
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Demurrer
to the first cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
Second Cause of Action: Negligent Hiring, Retention, and
Supervision
 
            Defendant
also demurs to the second cause of action for negligent hiring, retention, and
supervision. 
 
“Negligence liability will be imposed on an employer if it ‘knew or
should have known that hiring the employee created a particular risk or hazard
and that particular harm materializes.’” (Phillips v. TLC Plumbing, Inc. (2009)
172 Cal.App.4th 1133, 1139.) Liability for negligent supervision and/or
retention of an employee is one of direct liability for negligence, not
vicarious liability.” (Delfino v. Agilent Technologies, Inc. (2006) 145
Cal.App.4th 790, 815.) “To establish negligent supervision, a plaintiff must
show that a person in a supervisorial position over the actor had prior
knowledge of the actor’s propensity to do the bad act.” (Z.V. v. County of
Riverside (2015) 238Cal.App.4th 889, 902.)
 
Defendant contends that this cause of action is not adequately pled
because Plaintiff has only alleged what it contends are “legal conclusions” that
Defendant knew or should have known of the janitor’s propensity to harm minors.
(See SAC ¶¶ 18, 20, 23, 41, 46, 48.) These allegations, however, are not legal
conclusions, but allegations of ultimate facts, which are permissible at
the pleading stage. (See, e.g., Burks v. Poppy Construction Co. (1962)
57 Cal.2d 463, 473-74 [describing examples of ultimate facts].) Moreover, Defendant’s
authorities proffered for the assertion that greater specificity is required
are not on point for a childhood sexual abuse case. (See Thompson v.
Sacramento City Unified Sch. Dist. (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1352, 1370-71
[violence between students]; Nola M. v. University of Southern California (1993)
16 Cal.App.4th, 421, 436-37 [sexual assault of adult college student].) The
Court is not persuaded that these allegations are insufficient.  The details Defendant seeks can be explored
in discovery.
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Demurrer to the second cause of action is
OVERRULED. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint is OVERRULED. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
