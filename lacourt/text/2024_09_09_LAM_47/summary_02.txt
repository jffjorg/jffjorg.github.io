And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District. The defendant demurred to the first and second causes of action for negligence and negligent hiring, retention, and supervision. The judge has overruled the demurrer to both causes of action.

In the first cause of action, the judge found that the defendant has a duty to protect the plaintiff, John Doe, from the alleged harm. The judge concluded that the Second Amended Complaint adequately alleges a special relationship between the parties, which satisfies the element of duty.

In the second cause of action, the judge found that the plaintiff has adequately pled the elements of negligent hiring, retention, and supervision. The judge concluded that the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint are not legal conclusions, but rather allegations of ultimate facts, which are permissible at the pleading stage.

The judge has ordered the defendant to give notice of the ruling. The parties may submit on the tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email by a certain date.
