And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motions to compel further responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production. After the parties met and conferenced, they reached an agreement on all discovery issues except for form interrogatory 17.1 as it pertains to requests for admissions nos. 2, 23, and 27. The judge ruled that plaintiff is not required to provide further responses to these requests, as plaintiff did not deny them and defendant did not provide sufficient information to admit the matter.

The only remaining issue is defendant's request for sanctions. The judge ruled against defendant on one aspect of its motion, and while defendant did concede some of plaintiff's arguments during the meet and confer process, the judge found that some of plaintiff's opposition positions were not justified. Therefore, the judge awarded reduced sanctions to plaintiff and his attorney in the amount of $1,183.
