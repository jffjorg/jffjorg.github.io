CASE:                         Dylan Scott Perry v. Board of Trustees
of California Physicians’ Service, et al.
 
CASE NO.:                 24STCV11832            
 
MOTION
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION

 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff Dylan Scott Perry, in pro per
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): Defendant California
Physicians’ Service, d/b/a Blue Shield of California
 
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
In his Complaint filed on May 10, 2024, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants
cancelled his health insurance without adequate justification. 
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further
responses to Requests for Production propounded to Defendant California
Physicians’ Service. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further
responses to Requests for Production propounded to Defendant California
Physicians’ Service. 
 
Although Plaintiff seeks to compel further responses to
requests for production to which Defendant has objected, Plaintiff has not
included a declaration describing his efforts to informally resolve this
dispute, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310. Nor has
Plaintiff provided a Separate Statement in support of the motion, as required
by California Rule of Court 3.1345(c) describing each request, each response,
and the factual and legal reasons why a further response is required. Plaintiff
has also not provided any evidence indicating that this motion was made within
45 days of receipt of the responses, such that the Court has jurisdiction to
hear the motion. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310(c).) Finally, Plaintiff has
offered no explanation of why good cause exists for these requests, as required
by section 2031.310 subdivision (b)(1) beyond a single statement in his reply that
“I need that stuff because those are my doe Defendants.” For these reasons,
Plaintiff’s motion is procedurally and substantively deficient.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses
to Requests for Production is DENIED. 
 
Moving Party is ordered to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
