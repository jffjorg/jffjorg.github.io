And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production from the defendant. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant cancelled his health insurance without adequate justification and seeks to compel further responses to requests for production. However, the plaintiff has not included a declaration describing his efforts to informally resolve the dispute, nor has he provided a separate statement in support of the motion or evidence indicating that the motion was made within 45 days of receipt of the responses. Additionally, the plaintiff has not provided any explanation of why good cause exists for the requests. As a result, the judge has denied the motion, finding it to be procedurally and substantively deficient.
