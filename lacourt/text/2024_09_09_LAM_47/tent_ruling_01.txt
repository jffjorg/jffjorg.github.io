STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an employment discrimination action that was filed on November 7,

relieved as counsel. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorney Ben Rothman, counsel for
Plaintiff, moves to be relieved as counsel. 
 
Moving counsel filed all three required forms (MC-051,
-052, and -053). However, Moving Counsel did not include a proof of service as
required by California Rules of Court rule 3.1362(d).  The
Court will therefore continue this matter to permit Moving Counsel to serve all
parties to this action and file proof of service with the Court. 
 
            Accordingly,
Attorney Ben Rothman, Counsel for Plaintiff’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel
is CONTINUED to Wednesday, October 9, 2024 at 9:00 AM. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
