RULING
            The application is GRANTED.  The court Grants Carl J. Snider’s request to

BACKGROUND
            On June 5, 2023, Suzanne Matek filed
a complaint against Fire Insurance Exchange for (1) breach of contract and (2)
breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. 
DISCUSSION
Attorney Carl J. Snider requests
leave to appear as counsel pro hac vice for plaintiff Suzanne Matek.
Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 9.40
provides that an attorney in good standing in another jurisdiction may apply to
appear as counsel pro hac vice in the State of California by filing a verified
application together with proof of service by mail of a copy of the application
and notice of hearing on all parties who have appeared in the case and on the
State Bar of California at its San Francisco office, with payment of a $50.00
fee, so long as that attorney is not a resident of the State of California, and
is not regularly engaged in substantial business, professional, or other
activities in the State of California.  
The application must state:  (1) the applicant’s residence and office
address; (2) the courts to which the applicant has been admitted to practice
and the dates of admission; (3) that the applicant is a member in good standing
in those courts; (4) that the applicant is not currently suspended or disbarred
in any court; (5) the title of each court and cause in which the applicant has
filed an application to appear as counsel pro hac vice in this state in the
preceding two years, the date of each application, and whether or not it was
granted; and (5) the name, address, and telephone number of the active member
of the State Bar of California who is attorney of record in the local
action.  CRC Rule 9.40(d).
The court finds that attorney Carl
J. Snider’s application complies with the requirements of Rule 9.40.  The applicant has paid the required $50.00
fee to the State Bar of California.  CRC
Rule 9.40(e).
The application is GRANTED.
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice
of this ruling.
