record, Clark Hill LLP in the amount of $2,125.00.

 
RULING: The motion is granted as set forth below.
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Olivia Morena Posada
aka Olivia M. Posada’s (Plaintiff) lease/purchase of a 2022 Honda CR-V (the
Vehicle.  Plaintiff contends that the
Vehicle is defective and Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (Honda) has
been unable to service or repair the Vehicle to conform to the applicable
express warranties after a reasonable number of opportunities.  Plaintiff further contends that despite the
foregoing, Honda has failed to promptly replace/repurchase the Vehicle as
required under the Song-Beverly Act.    
 
As a result, on 12/7/22, Plaintiff filed this action
against Honda for: (1) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express
Warranty and (2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied
Warranty.  Honda filed an answer to the
complaint on 1/3/23.  
 
On 3/14/23, Plaintiff propounded Requests for Production
of Documents, Set 1, on Honda.  (Tran
Decl., Ex.A).  On 4/25/23, Honda served
responses to the requests.  (Id.,
Ex.B).  Plaintiff contends that in
response to Requests 22-23, 25-29, 32, 45-46 and 48-49 Honda failed to properly
respond/object.  Despite meet and confer
efforts and several extensions of time to file a motion to compel further
responses (with the last extension ending on 12/15/23), Honda failed to provide
further responses.  (Tran Decl., Ex.C-E).    
 
On 12/15/23, Plaintiff filed and served the instant
motion seeking an order compelling Honda to provide further responses to Plaintiff’s
Requests for Production of Documents, Set 1, Nos. 22-23, 25-29, 32, 45-46 and
48-49.  Additionally, Plaintiff requests
an order imposing sanctions against Honda and its counsel of record, Clark Hill
LLP in the amount of $2,125.00.  Honda
has not opposed or otherwise responded to the motion.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
A party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not
privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the action or to
the determination of any motion made in the action, if the matter itself is
admissible or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.  See CCP
2017.010.  Doubts as to relevance are
generally resolved in favor of allowing discovery.  Colonial Life & Acc. Ins. Co.
(1982) 31 C3d 785, 790.
 
CCP 2031.310(a) provides:
 
“On receipt of a response to a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may
move for an order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding
party deems that any of the following apply: 
(1) A statement of compliance with
the demand is incomplete. 
(2) A representation of inability
to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. 
(3) An objection in the response is
without merit or too general.” 
 
The subject discovery requests seek Honda’s training
materials and policies and procedures for complying with the Song Beverly Act’s
requirements (Requests 22-23, 25-29, 32), all documents evidencing complaints
by owners of 2022 Honda CR-V vehicles regarding any of the complaints the
subject vehicle was presented to Honda’s authorized repair facilities for
repair during the warranty period and all documents evidencing warranty repairs
to 2022 Honda CR-V vehicles regarding any of the components that Honda or Honda’s
authorized repair facilities performed repairs on under warranty (Requests
45-46), and Honda’s application and any response to any application for
certification of its third party dispute resolution process by the Department
of Consumer Affairs (Requests 48-49).  Honda
has objected to the requests on the grounds of ambiguity, overbreadth, undue
burden, harassment, unintelligibility, relevance, privacy, trade secret,
attorney-client privilege, and requires Honda to respond on behalf of another
entity.     
 
The information/documents sought is/are relevant to
Plaintiff’s claims under the Song-Beverly Act because they will show whether
others experienced the same issues Plaintiff experienced with the Vehicle.  See Donlen (2013) 217 CA4th
138, 154.  Additionally, the documents  may show the willfulness of Honda’s refusal to
repurchase or replace the Vehicle based on its policies and procedures which is
also relevant to the issue of civil penalties. 
See Johnson (2005) 35 C4th 1191, 1198-1199; Oregel
(1995) 90 CA4th 1094; Kwan (1994) 23 CA4th 174, 186; Civil Code 1794(c).
   
 
Similarly, documents regarding similar customer
complaints that Plaintiff had with the Vehicle from owners of other 2022 Honda
CR-V vehicles and the same warranty repairs made to the  Vehicle on other 2022 Honda CR-V vehicles (Requests
45-46) may show that the complaints Plaintiff had and the repairs made to the
Vehicle were widespread, and that Honda should have used that information in
evaluating whether the Vehicle qualified for repurchase or replacement under
the Song-Beverly Act. 
 
In addition to being relevant to Plaintiff’s claims for
breach of the Song Beverly Act because they will assist in establishing the
existence of a defect or nonconformity in the Vehicle and Honda’s
failure/inability to repair that defect or nonconformity in the Vehicle, the
documents may refute Honda’s affirmative defenses, such as lack of maintenance,
misuse or abuse, or modifications to the Vehicle being the cause of the
nonconformities to warranty that Plaintiff complained of. 
 
In response to certain of the requests (Requests 22-23,
25-29, 32), Honda has also included an objection based on attorney-client
privilege without providing the necessary information/ privilege log for
Plaintiff or the Court to evaluate the privilege claim.  See CCP 2031.240(c).  As such, it cannot be determined whether
Honda is properly withholding documents based on the attorney-client privilege
in response to these requests.    
 
If documents regarding Honda’s third-party dispute resolution
process in California that is certified by the Department of Consumer Affairs
(Requests 48-49) do not exist, Plaintiff may be entitled to civil penalties
without having to prove Honda’s willful violation of the Song-Beverly Act.  Civil Code 1794(e); Jernigan (1994) 24
CA4th 488, 491-493.
 
Honda has failed to establish the validity of its
objections to the subject requests. 
Contrary to Honda’s assertions the requests are not vague, ambiguous, overbroad
or unduly burdensome.  
 
Plaintiff is also entitled to an award of sanctions
against Honda and its counsel, Clark Hill LLP, in the amount of $1,850.00 (4 hours
for associate to prepare motion at $250/hour + 1 hour for review of motion at
$395/hour + hour to prepare for hearing and appear at $395/hour + $60 filing
fee) for their failure to comply with their discovery obligations. CCP 2031.310(h);
(Tran Decl. ¶¶13-14).   
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
Honda is ordered to provide further responses to Plaintiff’s Request for
Production of Documents, Set 1, Nos. Nos. 22-23, 25-29, 32, 45-46 and 48-49
within 30 days.  Additionally, sanctions
are imposed against Honda and its counsel of record, Clark Hill LLP, in the
amount of $1,850.00, payable within 30 days.

RULING: The motion is granted as set forth below.
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Olivia Morena Posada
aka Olivia M. Posada’s (Plaintiff) lease/purchase of a 2022 Honda CR-V (the
Vehicle.  Plaintiff contends that the
Vehicle is defective and Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (Honda) has
been unable to service or repair the Vehicle to conform to the applicable
express warranties after a reasonable number of opportunities.  Plaintiff further contends that despite the

against Honda for: (1) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express
Warranty and (2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied
Warranty.  Honda filed an answer to the
complaint on 1/3/23.  
 
On 3/14/23, Plaintiff propounded Special Interrogatories,
Set 1, on Honda.  (Tran Decl., Ex.A).  On 4/25/23, Honda served responses to the interrogatories.  (Id., Ex.B).  Plaintiff contends that Honda’s responses to Special
Interrogatories 10, 46, 47 and 48 are deficient.  Despite meet and confer efforts and several
extensions of time to file a motion to compel further responses (with the last
extension ending on 12/15/23), Honda failed to provide further responses.  (Tran Decl., Ex.C-E).    
 
On 12/15/23, Plaintiff filed and served the instant
motion seeking an order compelling Honda to provide further responses to Plaintiff’s
Special Interrogatories, Set 1, Nos. 10, 46, 47 and 48.    Additionally, Plaintiff requests an order

ANALYSIS
 
A party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not
privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the action or to
the determination of any motion made in the action, if the matter itself is
admissible or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.  See CCP
2017.010.  Doubts as to relevance are
generally resolved in favor of allowing discovery.  Colonial Life & Acc. Ins. Co.
(1982) 31 C3d 785, 790.
 
CCP 2030.300(a) provides:
 
“(a) On receipt of a response to
interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following
apply:
(1) An answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete.
(2) An exercise of the option to
produce documents under Section
2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those
documents is inadequate.
(3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general.”
 
To establish his claim under the Song-Beverly Act,
Plaintiff must prove, among other things, that the Vehicle contained a defect,
covered by Honda’s warranty, which substantially impaired its use, value, or
safety and which Ford was unable to repair after a reasonable number of
attempts.  See Civil Code 790 et
seq.; CACI No. 3201.  The information
sought in the subject interrogatories is relevant to Plaintiff’s claims because
it would tend to show whether a widespread defect or nonconformity, of the same
type that Plaintiff experienced, exists in these types of vehicles.  The information could also assist in refuting
Honda’s affirmative defenses which claim that Plaintiff and/or others misused
or abused the Vehicle or engaged in unauthorized or unreasonable use which
caused the problems with the Vehicle.  If
a substantial number of other owners of the same type of vehicle experienced
the same defects and nonconformities, such information would tend to show that
the defects claimed in Plaintiff’s Vehicle were not caused by misuse, abuse, or
unreasonable use.
 
The Special Interrogatories at issue are relevant
Plaintiff’s claims as they seek information regarding Honda’s contentions as to
why the Vehicle does not qualify for repurchase (Special Interrogatory 10) and
the five symptoms and components with the highest repair rates per thousand for
2022 Honda CR-V vehicles (Special Interrogatories 46-48).  Specifically, Special Interrogatory 10 seeks
information regarding Honda’s contention that the Vehicle did not qualify for a
repurchase.  Honda’s reliance on CCP 2030.230
regarding production of documents in response to the interrogatory is
insufficient as it leaves Plaintiff to guess which specific documents contain
the facts supporting Honda’s contention that the Vehicle does not qualify for a
repurchase under the Song Beverly Act. 
 
Special Interrogatories 46-48 seek information regarding
the five symptoms and components with the highest repair rates per thousand for
2022 Honda CR-V vehicles.  Information
about other similar vehicle complaints may show the existence of a widespread
defect or non-conformity, or show when it arose, and may also show Honda’s
knowledge of wide-spread problems with the vehicle and Honda’s failure to act
despite this knowledge.  Information in
response to these interrogatories may show that the symptoms exhibited by the
Vehicle were among the most commonly occurring problems with this year, make,
and model vehicle.  Information showing
the top five components and symptoms at issue, if they are the same as the
problems experienced by Plaintiff, could show that Honda had knowledge about a
widespread defect or nonconformity and still failed to act.  Such information is relevant to proving
whether a civil penalty is warranted because it would tend to show whether Honda
made its determination not to repurchase Plaintiff’s vehicle despite having
information indicating that these types of vehicles contained a defect or
nonconformity.   See Lukather
(2010) 181 CA4th 1041, 1051.
 
Honda has failed to meet its burden of justifying its
objections in response to this motion to compel further responses.  See Fairmont Insurance Co.
(2000) 22 C4th 245, 255; Coy (1962) 58 C2d 210, 220-221.
 
Plaintiff is also entitled to an award of sanctions
against Honda and its counsel, Clark Hill LLP, in the amount of $1,600.00 (3 hours
for associate to prepare motion at $250/hour + 1 hour for review of motion at
$395/hour + hour to prepare for hearing and appear at $395/hour + $60 filing
fee) CCP 203.300(d); (Tran Decl. ¶¶9-10). 
 
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
Honda is ordered to provide further responses to Plaintiff’s Special
Interrogatories, Set 1, Nos. 10 and 46-48 within 30 days.  Additionally, sanctions are imposed against
Honda and its counsel of record, Clark Hill LLP, in the amount of $1,600.00,
payable within 30 days.  
 
The Court notes that Plaintiff failed to electronically
bookmark the exhibits attached to the Tran declaration as required.  CRC 3.1110(f)(4).  The parties are warned that failure to comply
with this requirement in the future may result in papers not being considered,
matters being continued so that papers may be resubmitted in compliance and/or
the imposition of sanctions.
