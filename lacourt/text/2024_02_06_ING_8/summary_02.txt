And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling in a case between American Ironworks Manufacturing, Inc. (AIM) and Milender White Residential SoCal Corp., Inglewood Market Gateway LLC, et al. The case involves a motion to compel arbitration filed by Milender. The Court has granted the motion to compel arbitration as against AIM, but denies the motion to compel non-signatory ARCH into arbitration. The Court has also set an arbitration status conference for December 10, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department IW-8.

The dispute in this case centers around whether ARCH, a non-signatory to the arbitration agreement, can be compelled into the arbitration between AIM and Milender. The Court has found that there is no evidence to suggest that either AIM or Milender intended for ARCH to be bound by the arbitration provision. Therefore, the Court denies the motion to compel ARCH into arbitration.

The Court has ordered a stay of the civil litigation matter pending the completion of the arbitration and has set a hearing on any petition to enforce the arbitrator's award.
