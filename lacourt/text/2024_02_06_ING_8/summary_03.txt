Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a civil lawsuit filed by Ariana Fields against LAZ Karp Associates, LLC, Serco Group, City of Inglewood, and County of Los Angeles. The lawsuit alleges causes of action for intentional tort, general negligence, and motor vehicle negligence.

The judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by LAZ Karp Associates, LLC as to the Third Cause of Action for motor vehicle negligence, finding that the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action against LAZ. The judge also sustains the demurrer filed by City of Inglewood, finding that the complaint fails to plead sufficient facts to state a cause of action against a public entity.

The judge grants in part and denies in part the motion to strike filed by LAZ Karp Associates, LLC, striking only the allegations related to punitive damages against LAZ.

The judge orders the parties to continue the case management conference until the pleadings are settled. The judge's tentative ruling provides guidance on the pleading requirements for a cause of action against a public entity and the need for specificity in pleading statutory liability.
