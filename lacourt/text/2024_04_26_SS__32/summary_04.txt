```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge grants the defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication against the plaintiff's complaint and the city's cross-complaint. The defendants have met their initial burden of establishing no triable issue of fact. The plaintiff's fall did not occur on the defendants' property, but on abutting public property. The defendants present evidence that they did not create the alleged dangerous condition (i.e. the asphalt on the sidewalk) and did not exert control over the sidewalk. Since no oppositions have been filed, the plaintiff and/or city fail to meet their burden.
