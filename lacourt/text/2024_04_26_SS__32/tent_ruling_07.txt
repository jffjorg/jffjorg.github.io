the Code of Civil Procedure, a motion for judgment on the pleadings may not be
made “if a pretrial conference order has been entered pursuant to Section 575,
or within 30 days of the date the action is initially set for trial, whichever
is later, unless the court otherwise permits.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 438(e)
[emphasis added].)


[2] “The
statutory text of the Act, its purpose and history, and our prior case law all
indicate that public schools, as governmental entities engaged in the provision
of a free and public education, are not ‘business establishments’ within the
meaning of the Act. (Civ. Code, § 51, subd. (b).) To the contrary, they make
clear that the Act was not enacted to reach this type of state action.” (Brennon B., supra, 13 Cal.5th at 669.)
