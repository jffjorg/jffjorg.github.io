And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling discusses the applicability of the Act to public schools. The judge notes that under the Code of Civil Procedure, a motion for judgment on the pleadings cannot be made if a pretrial conference order has been entered or within 30 days of the trial date, whichever is later. The judge also cites prior case law and statutory text to conclude that public schools, as governmental entities engaged in providing a free and public education, are not "business establishments" within the meaning of the Act. The judge's ruling suggests that the Act was not enacted to reach state action, and therefore, does not apply to public schools.
