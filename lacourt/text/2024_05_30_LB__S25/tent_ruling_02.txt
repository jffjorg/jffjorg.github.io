 Case Number:  23LBCV01593    Hearing Date:   May 30, 2024    Dept:  S25 Procedural BackgroundOn August 23, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a complaint against Defendants Frank Colaruotolo Consulting, Inc. (“FCC”), Pacific Crane Maintenance Company, LLC (“PCMC”), and Does 1-10. On April 11, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint (“FAC”), alleging two causes of action: (1) Negligence against Defendants FCC, Frank Colaruotolo, and Does 2 through 10; and (2) Negligence against Defendants PCMC and Does 2 through 10.Plaintiffs Martin Ruiz and Graciela Ruiz are the surviving biological father and mother of the decedent, respectively. (FAC ¶¶ 1, 2.) Plaintiffs are suing for the loss of their adult son, decedent Edgar Ruiz. Decedent was killed during a forklift incident on January 18, 2022. (Forouzan Decl., ¶ 2.)Since the filing of Plaintiffs’ original complaint, a related case has been filed by Nico Ruiz against Defendants FCC and CSI Services, Inc., case number 24LBCV00081. Both this case, 23LBCV01593, and case number 24LBCV00081 have been deemed related by this Court. (See 3/14/2024 Notice of Ruling Re: Related Cases and Upcoming Hearing Dates in Case No. 24LBCV00081; Forouzan Decl., ¶ 4.) On May 7, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a motion to consolidate this case, 23LBCV01593, with the related case no. 24LBCV00081. The hearing on the motion to consolidate is set for July 11, 2024.Plaintiffs did not know about the existence of CSI Services, Inc. until after the filing of the related case and learned of its existence through counsel for Nico Ruiz on March 18, 2024. (Forouzan Decl., ¶¶ 5, 14 28.) The two-year statute of limitation had passed on Plaintiffs’ case. On March 18, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel met and conferred with Defendant FCC’s counsel via email to request a stipulation for leave to name CSI Services, Inc. as a Doe Defendant. (Forouzan Decl., ¶¶ 5-6; Exh. A.) Two days later, Defendant FCC’s counsel responded and requested a week to consider the proposal. (Forouzan Decl., ¶ 7.) After waiting a week with no response from Defendant FCC’s counsel, Plaintiff initiated efforts to appear ex parte in order to request for leave toamend. However, Plaintiffs elected to proceed via the instant motion to provide notice to all parties. The instant motion was filed on April 15, 2024. No opposition has been filed.Legal Standard“Any judge, at any time before or after commencement of trial, in the furtherance of justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, may allow the amendment of any pleading or pretrial conference order.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 576.)As a condition of granting leave to amend, the trial court may require a plaintiff to bring a motion that is compliant with rule 3.1324 of the California Rules of Court (Rule 3.1324), including the evidentiary requirements, and doing so does not constitute an abuse of discretion. (Hataishi v. First American Home Buyers Protection Corp. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1454, 1469.)A party requesting leave to amend must submit a motion which includes: (1) a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading, serially numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings; (2) a statement of which allegations would be deleted by the amendment, and where they are located in the previous pleading; and (3) a statement of what allegations would be added by the amendment, and where they are located in the proposed pleading. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324(a).) The motion must be accompanied by a declaration stating: (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) why the request was not made earlier. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(b).)Code Civ. Proc. § 474 provide the process for naming fictitiously named defendants:“When the plaintiff is ignorant of the name of a defendant, he [or she] must state that fact in the complaint, or the affidavit if the action is commenced by affidavit, and such defendant may be designated in any pleading or proceeding by any name, and when his true name is discovered, the pleading or proceeding must be amended accordingly.”To amend the complaint to add fictitiously named defendants under Code of Civ. Proc. § 474, the complaint must have alleged that plaintiff was ignorant of the true names and capacities of defendants sued by fictitious names [e.g., DOES 1-10], and that the names under which such defendants were sued were fictitious. (See Kerr-McGee Chemical Corp. v. Superior Court (1984) 160 Cal. App. 3d 594, 597-598.) The complaint must also contain charging allegations alleging that the fictitiously named defendants were responsible for the acts complained of by plaintiff. (See Winding Creek v. McGlashan (1996) 44 Cal. App. 4th 933, 941-943.)When an amendment is sought after the statute of limitations has run, the amendedcomplaint will be deemed filed as of the date of the original complaint, provided the following:1. The original complaint stated a valid cause of action against the now-identified Doe;2. The Plaintiff was “genuinely ignorant” of the defendant’s identity;3. The amended complaint is based on the “same general set of facts” and refers to the “same accident and same injuries,” as in the operative complaint.(See Austin v. Massachusetts Bonding & Ins. Co. (1961) 56 C2d 596, 600-601, 15CR 817, 819; San Diego Navy Broadway Complex Coalition v. California Coastal Comm'n (2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 563, 579; Eghtesad v. State Farm Gen. Ins. Co. (2020) 51 Cal.App.5th 406, 415 (citing text)).Tentative RulingPlaintiffs have met the requirements for leave to amend to name a fictitiously named Doe after the passage of the statute of limitations.The FAC alleges that all defendants, including all fictitiously named Doe defendants, were the alter egos of one another or acting in a single enterprise, thereby stating a valid cause of action against CSI Services, Inc.. (FAC ¶ 11.) CSI Services, Inc. has the same agent for service of process, Defendant Frank Colaruotolo, as previously named Defendant Frank Colaruotolo Consulting, Inc. (Forouzan Decl., ¶ 9, 29, 30; Exh. B.)Plaintiffs were genuinely ignorant of CSI Services, Inc. Plaintiffs were able to discover Defendant PCMC through prelitigation investigations; however, they could not discover CSI Services, Inc. through their investigation. (See Forouzan Decl., ¶¶ 11, 13; Exh. C.) Plaintiffs did not learn about CSI Services, Inc. until after a conversation with counsel for the related case on March 18, 2024. (Forouzan Decl., ¶ 14, 28.)Plaintiffs seek leave to replace Doe 2 with a newly discovered entity. Thus, the amendment is based on the same general set of facts and refers to the same accident and same injuries.Defendants have not filed an opposition and have not shown there will be prejudice to them by allowing Plaintiffs’ leave to amend.Good cause has been shown and Plaintiffs have complied with Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324. The motion for leave to amend is GRANTED.
