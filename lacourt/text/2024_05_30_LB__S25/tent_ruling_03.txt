 Case Number:  23LBCV02389    Hearing Date:   May 30, 2024    Dept:  S25 Procedural BackgroundOn December 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendant for breach of contract and common counts. Plaintiff alleges payment of $34,000 to Defendant for the purchase of a functional 2017 Truck Chassis VIN LRJC46372H1000934 (“Truck”) on or about August 12, 2022. (Compl., p. 3, BC-1.) Plaintiff discovered that the Truck sold to Plaintiff was not legally operable on California highways and could not be registered with the DMV. (Compl., p. 3, BC-2.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant refused to rescind sale of or to refund Plaintiff for the purchase of the Truck. (Compl., p. 3, BC-2.)On February 5, 2024, Defendant propounded following discovery: (1) Request for Production of Documents (Set One), (2) Form Interrogatories (Set One), and (3) Special Interrogatories (Set One) (hereinafter “Defendant’s discovery requests”). Plaintiff’s discovery responses were due on March 8, 2024. (See Seyfnia Decl., ¶ 6.) Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond to Defendant counsel’s March 15, 2024 email requesting responses be served no later than March 20, 2024. (See Seyfnia Decl., ¶ 7; Exh. D.) Further, Plaintiff did not request an extension to respond past the deadline. (See Seyfnia Decl., ¶ 8.)On March 21, 2024, Defendant filed these two motions seeking compliance with the discovery requests and requested $3,973.30 in monetary sanctions be imposed on Plaintiff and its counsel, jointly and severally.Legal StandardIf a party to whom interrogatories and document demands are directed fails to respond at all, the propounding party’s remedy is to seek a court order compelling answers thereto. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) All that needs to be shown is that the discovery was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. The moving party is not required to show a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the matter informally before filing this motion. A motion to compel initial discovery responses need not show good cause, meeting and conferring, or timely filing, and need not be accompanied by a separate statement. (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) The failure to timely respond also waives all objections.¿¿On motion, a party may be relieved from its waiver of objections if: (1) the party subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance “with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240” and (2) “[t]he party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a)(1)-(2).)Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(d) provides that a misuse of the discovery process is failing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(h) states that a misuse of the discovery process includes making or opposing, unsuccessfully and without substantial justification, a motion to compel or limit discovery. A court may impose a monetary sanction against a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process or any attorney advising such conduct under Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(a). A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771.)Tentative RulingPlaintiff’s opposition is untimely; nonetheless, Plaintiff has now provided responses to the propounded discovery. These responses render Defendant’s motions moot. The Court declines to award monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel in this instance; however, further continued failure by Plaintiff to timely respond to discovery requests or engage in the discovery process, including any request for further responses by Defendant, may result in future monetary sanctions.
