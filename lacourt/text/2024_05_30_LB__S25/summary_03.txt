And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the judge's thoughts on a future court hearing. The case is about a breach of contract and common counts between the plaintiff and the defendant. The plaintiff purchased a 2017 truck chassis from the defendant but discovered that it was not legally operable on California highways. The defendant refused to rescind the sale or refund the money. The plaintiff failed to respond to the defendant's discovery requests, which led to the defendant filing a motion to compel the plaintiff's responses. The court finds that the plaintiff's opposition was untimely, but the plaintiff has since provided responses to the discovery requests, making the defendant's motions moot. The court declines to impose monetary sanctions on the plaintiff and his counsel, but warns that further failure to comply with discovery requests may result in future monetary sanctions.
