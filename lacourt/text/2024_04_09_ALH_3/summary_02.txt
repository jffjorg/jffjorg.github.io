And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is in response to the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's Second, Fourth, and Sixth Causes of Action. The plaintiff, Herbert Schwarz, alleges that he was subjected to harassment and retaliation by his supervisor, Steven Gowan, and the company HumanGood. The plaintiff claims that he was forced to resign due to the stress and anxiety caused by the hostile work environment.

The Court finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently pled a claim for harassment and retaliation. The Court OVERRULED the demurrer to the Second Cause of Action and SUSTAINED Gowan's demurrer to the Fourth Cause of Action. The Court also OVERRULED the demurrer to the Sixth Cause of Action.

The Court notes that the plaintiff's claim under the Unfair Competition Law (UCL) is not affected by the lack of standing, as the UCL prohibits any unlawful business practice. The Court also finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently pled a claim for failure to prevent harassment.

The parties are advised to submit on the tentative ruling by email to the Court.
