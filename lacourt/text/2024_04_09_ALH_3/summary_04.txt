And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court tentatively denies plaintiff Michelle Wu's motion for sanctions and attorneys' fees against defendant Jennifer Cheung. The court finds that Cheung's frivolous arguments in her motion for an undertaking did not warrant the 4 hours spent by plaintiff's attorney addressing them. The court also notes that plaintiff's own opposition did not address Cheung's arguments in depth. The court cites code sections 128.5 and 1010 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as well as case law, to support its decision. The court finds that Cheung's arguments were not made in bad faith and that plaintiff's attorney's time was excessive.
