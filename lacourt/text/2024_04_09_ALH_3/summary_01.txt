```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, which argued that the plaintiff's admissions in discovery contradict the allegations in the complaint. The defendant also argued that it cannot be vicariously liable for intentional torts committed by Borromeo. The court found that the defendant's motion was based on a faulty understanding of the complaint, which actually alleges that the defendant is liable for its own negligence in hiring, retaining, or supervising Borromeo. The court also noted that the defendant's reliance on the case of Lisa M. v. Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital was misplaced, as it does not apply to the facts of this case. The court's tentative ruling is subject to change after the parties have an opportunity to review and respond.
