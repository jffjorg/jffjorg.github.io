agreement; (5) foreclosure of collateral; (6) claim and delivery; and (7) fraud.

 
On February 18, 2022, Plaintiff filed proof of
service by substituted service indicating that the summons and complaint were
served on Defendants OG FARMZ, INC  and
CHONG SANG ERIC TAK on December 20, 2021 an Asian male, in his 50s, that
refused to identify himself. 
 
          On
June 5, 2023, this Court entered default against Defendants and struck their
answers. 
 
          On
June 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed a request for entry of default judgment against
Defendants. This Court continued the matter to allow Plaintiff to cure
deficiencies in the default judgment package. (Min. Order 9/8/23.)
 
On September 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed a new
request for entry of default judgment against Defendants. 
 
Legal Standard
 
Pursuant to Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a),
“a party seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request
for Entry of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100)…the
following must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: (1) except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of the plaintiffs claim; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence
in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary;
(4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a declaration of nonmilitary
status for each defendant against whom judgment is sought; (6) a proposed form
of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought
or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under code of
Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorney fees if
allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.”
 
Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(1),
items are allowable as costs under Section 1032 if they are “filing, motion,
and jury fees.”
 
Discussion
 
Here, Plaintiff 12 ALBANY, LLC, a California
limited liability company filed a request for entry of default judgment against
Defendants OG FARMZ, INC., a California Corporation; CHONG SANG ERIC TAK, an
individual; and THE ONE1 ENTERTAINEMENT, INC., a California Corporation on September
25, 2023. Plaintiff requests a judgment of $436,686.52, consisting of (1) $340,00.00
in demand of complaint; (2) $82,530.90 in prejudgment interest; (3) $435.00 in
costs; and (4) $13,720.62 in attorneys’ fees. 
 
The Court has reviewed Plaintiff’s default
judgment package and the following items are sufficient for entry of default
judgment:
 
·       Plaintiff used the mandatory CIV-100 form. 
·       Item #2 of the CIV-100 form is properly filled
out with the amount of demand, prejudgment interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees
being requested.
·       Item #7 of the CIV-100 form consists of
memorandum of costs that are allowable under CCP § 1033.5(a)(1). 
·       Item #8 of the CIV-100 form properly declares
the Defendant’s nonmilitary status. 
·       Plaintiff filed a proposed form of judgment
using the JUD-100 form.
·       Plaintiff filed a request for dismissal properly
dismissing DOES 1 through 30. 
·       Plaintiff filed a declaration from their
custodian of records with exhibits attached to support its request for damages
and prejudgment interest.
·       Plaintiff filed a brief statement that
summarizes the case. 
 
          However, the Court finds that
Plaintiff’s default package is deficient for the following reason:
 
·       Plaintiff filed a declaration from counsel of
record to support request for attorney fees not in compliance with Local Rule
3.214. Plaintiff calculates the attorney fees using the “contested case”
formula of Local Rule 3.214(a): “Over $100,000, $5,270 plus 2% of the excess
over $100,000.” Plaintiff contends this is a contested case. However, Plaintiff
is seeking default judgment. As such, the attorney fees must be calculated
using the “default case” formula: “Over $100,000, $2,890 plus 1% of the excess
over $100,000.”
 
Therefore, Plaintiff 12 ALBANY, LLC’s request
for entry of default judgment against Defendants OG FARMZ, INC., a California
Corporation; CHONG SANG ERIC TAK, an individual; and THE ONE1 ENTERTAINEMENT,
INC., a California Corporation is CONTINUED to November 22, 2023 to allow
Plaintiff to file a new declaration in support of attorney fees with the
correct calculation as required under Local Rule 3.214(a).
