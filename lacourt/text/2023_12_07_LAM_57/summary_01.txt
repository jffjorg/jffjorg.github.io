And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories. The motion is granted in part, meaning the plaintiff will receive the information they requested in interrogatories 5, 7, 8, and 9. However, the motion is denied in part, meaning the plaintiff will not receive sanctions against the defendant. At the upcoming hearing, the court will discuss with the parties whether notices should be provided to employees whose names would be disclosed in response to interrogatory 5, in order to protect their privacy interests. The court's decision is guided by two California cases, Belaire-West Landscape v. Superior Court (2007) and Williams v. Superior Court (2017).
