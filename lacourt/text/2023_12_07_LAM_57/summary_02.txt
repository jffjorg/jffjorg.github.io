And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling addresses the demurrer to the fraud claim and the motion to strike the prayers for general damages and punitive damages in the complaint. The Judge overrules the demurrer and denies the motion to strike, but strikes the prayer for punitive damages on the ground that it sets forth a specific amount of punitive damages, in violation of Civil Code Section 3925(e). The critical allegations in the complaint include Osuna's failure to obtain an appraisal of property, her representation that the property would remain Maria Elena's, and her false representation that she had taken steps to actualize Maria Elena's share of property in Mexico. The Judge finds that the allegations are sufficient to support a finding of fraud and that punitive damages are available. The Judge also rejects the defendants' argument that general damages for emotional distress are not recoverable for legal malpractice claims, citing Smith v. Superior Court (1992).
