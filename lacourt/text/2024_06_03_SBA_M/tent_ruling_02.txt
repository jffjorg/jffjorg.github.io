23TRCV03283
1.      City of Gardena’s Demurrer to First Amended Complaint   
2.      Michael Sargent’s Motion for Leave to File Second
Amended Complaint  
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            City of Gardena’s Demurrer to First
Amended Complaint is deemed moot. 
 
            Michael Sargent’s Motion for Leave
to File Second Amended Complaint is granted.
 
            Background
 
            Plaintiff filed the Complaint on October
5, 2023.  The First Amended Complaint was
filed on December 27, 2023.  Plaintiff, a
former City Lieutenant, was forced to take industrial disability retirement
prior to Plaintiff becoming eligible for full retirement benefits.  This action was taken due to the Plaintiff’s
age and disability.  Plaintiff alleges
the following causes of action: 1. Violation of the Fair Employment and Housing
Act, Government Code § 12940(a); 2. Failure to Engage in Interactive Process in
Violation of FEHA (California Government Code § 12940(n)). 
 
             Meet and Confer
             
            Defendant set forth a meet and
confer declaration in sufficient compliance with CCP § 430.41.  (Decl. Danny Y. Yoo.) 
 
            Request for Judicial Notice
 
            Defendant’s request for judicial
notice is deemed moot.
 
            Demurrer

            A demurrer tests the sufficiency of
a complaint as a matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v.
Foundation Health (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In testing the sufficiency of the complaint,
the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.)  The Court may not
consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe (1994) 7 Cal.App.4th
634, 638.) Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint, the
plaintiff must show that the complaint alleges facts sufficient to establish
every element of each cause of action.  (Rakestraw
v. California Physicians Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.)  Where the complaint fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, courts should sustain the
demurrer.  (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig
v. County of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
 
            Sufficient facts are the essential
facts of the case "with reasonable precision and with particularity
sufficiently specific to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and
extent of his cause of action.”  (Gressley
v. Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.)  "Whether the plaintiff will be able to
prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer."  (Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180
Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.)  Under Code
Civil Procedure § 430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is
“uncertain.”  Uncertainty exists where a
complaint’s factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently
apprise a defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
 
            Defendant demurs to the First
Amended Complaint and each cause of action on the grounds that Plaintiff fails
to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action. CCP § 430.10(e). However,
upon the granting of Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file a Second Amended
Complaint, the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint has been rendered moot.
            
            Thus, for the foregoing reasons,
Defendant’s demurrer is deemed moot.     
 
Motion for Leave to Amend 
 
The court may, in
furtherance of justice, and on such terms as may be proper, allow a party to
amend any pleading.  Code Civ. Proc., §§
473 & 576.  Judicial policy favors
resolution of all disputed matters between the parties and, therefore, leave to
amend is generally liberally granted. 
Ordinarily, the court will not consider the validity of the proposed
amended pleading in ruling on a motion for leave since grounds for a demurrer
or motion to strike are premature. 
However, the court does have discretion to deny leave to amend where a
proposed amendment fails to state a valid cause of action as a matter of law
and the defect cannot be cured by further amendment.   Cal.
Casualty General Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 274, 281.

 
The application for leave to
amend should be made as soon as the need to amend is discovered.  The closer the trial date, the stronger the
showing required for leave to amend.  If
the party seeking the amendment has been dilatory, and the delay has prejudiced
the opposing party, the court has the discretion to deny leave to amend.  Hirsa
v. Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490.  Prejudice exists where the amendment would
require delaying the trial, resulting in loss of critical evidence, or added costs
of preparation such as an increased burden of discovery.  Magpali
v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488. 
 
Plaintiff moves for leave to
amend to file a Second Amended Complaint which would act as follows: “(1) the
addition of a new Defendant, City Manager Clint Osorio; (2) addition of new
legal claims to clarify previously existing cause of action; (3) addition of
new causes of action based off new findings of actions engaged in by the City
Manager; (4) revisions to current causes of action for more clarity; and (5)
additions to Plaintiff’s prayer for relief based off the new causes of action.”
 (Motion, page 6, lines 3-6.)  
 
Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1324(a) states: “A motion to amend a pleading before trial must:
(1) Include a copy of the
proposed amendment or amended pleading, which must be serially numbered to
differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments;
(2) State what allegations
in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any, and where, by
page, paragraph, and line number, the deleted allegations are located; and
(3) State what allegations
are proposed to be added to the previous pleading, if any, and where, by page,
paragraph, and line number, the additional allegations are located.” Id.
(emphasis added).
 
Plaintiff adequately
complied with Rule 3.1324(a). While compliance was not completed in the most
artful manner, Exhibit 2, which was attached to the declaration of Brooke A.
Reno, adequately sets forth the allegations to be added to the proposed
pleading. (Decl., Brooke A. Reno, ¶ 8, Ex. 2).
 
Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1324(b) requires that the moving party must submit a separate declaration
specifying:
“(1) The effect of the
amendment;
(2) Why the amendment is
necessary and proper;
(3) When the facts giving
rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and
(4) The reasons why the
request for amendment was not made earlier.”
 
Plaintiff adequately
complied with Rule 3.1324(b).  While
compliance was not completed in the most artful manner, Exhibit 2, which was attached
to the declaration of Brooke A. Reno, adequately sets forth facts to meet
elements (1) to (4) above.  (Decl.,
Brooke A. Reno, ¶ 8, Ex. 2.)
 
Defendant’s arguments in
opposition are unavailing. The Defendant’s arguments mostly consist of
contending that the newly proposed pleading fails to state sufficient facts
against Defendants.  However, when
reviewing a motion for leave to amend, the Court will usually not evaluate the
viability or merits of the pleading. The preferable practice is to test the
legal sufficiency of the proposed pleading with a proper motion or
demurrer.   See, Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior Court
(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048 (stating that, in the context of analyzing a
motion for leave to amend a pleading, that “the preferable practice would be to
permit the amendment and allow the parties to test its legal sufficiency by
demurrer, motion for judgment on the pleadings or other appropriate
proceedings.”)  If the causes of action
cannot be well stated by the Plaintiff, then Defendant will have the
opportunity to challenge the cause of action through the proper procedural
mechanisms.  In addition, there is no
prejudice by any purported delay.  The
Court notes that there is no trial date yet. 
 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s
Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint is granted. 
 
Plaintiff is ordered to file
the Second Amended Complaint within three days and serve the Second Amended
Complaint on existing parties within three days of this date. 
 
An OSC Re: Dismissal for
Failure to Serve Clint Osorio is set for _________.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice of this ruling.
