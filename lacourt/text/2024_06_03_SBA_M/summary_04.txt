And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, Honorable Gary Y. Tanaka, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Robert Lindholm, et al. v. Apollo Equine Transport, Inc., et al. (YC073049). The case concerns the enforcement of a settlement agreement between the parties and a motion to quash a subpoena duces tecum.

The Judge denied the Plaintiffs' motion to enforce the settlement agreement, finding that the email exchange between the parties was not a new "settlement agreement" but rather an attempt to collect on the original judgment. The Judge also concluded that the assignee's agreement to forebear collecting on the judgment was not consideration for the assignee's agreement to take less in settlement funds.

The Judge also denied the Plaintiffs' motion to quash the subpoena duces tecum, finding that the documents sought were not vague, ambiguous, burdensome, or oppressive and did not unduly intrude upon the Plaintiffs' or third parties' privacy interests. The Judge held that the documents were necessary for the enforcement of judgments and judgment debtor examinations.

The Judge denied the Plaintiffs' request for monetary sanctions.
