```

And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denied Defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the claim for punitive damages. The judge found that Defendant failed to meet its burden of proof under the Union Bank standard, as the discovery responses provided by Plaintiffs were not entirely devoid of facts. The judge also noted that the responses referred to previously produced documentary evidence that supported Plaintiffs' claim for punitive damages. As a result, the judge declined to shift the burden of proof to Plaintiffs.
