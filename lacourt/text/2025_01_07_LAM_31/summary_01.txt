And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a decision by Judge Kerry Bensinger in the case Old Goat Farms, LLC v. Alkhemist DM, LLC (Case No. 21STCV25790). The case involves a breach of contract and conversion claim by Old Goat Farms against Alkhemist DM, LLC. On August 15, 2024, the court rendered judgment in favor of Old Goat Farms for $603,385.88. Alkhemist DM, LLC has appealed the judgment, but has not posted bond. Old Goat Farms has filed a motion for an order appointing a receiver to satisfy the judgment. The motion is unopposed.

The court finds that exceptional circumstances exist to appoint a receiver, as Alkhemist DM, LLC operates a cash-based business that cannot deposit funds into a financial institution, and Old Goat Farms has demonstrated that there is no less intrusive collection method available. The appointment of a receiver would allow Alkhemist DM, LLC to continue its business operations while steadily satisfying the judgment from its income stream.

The tentative ruling grants the motion for an order appointing a receiver and orders the moving party to give notice.
