And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's deposition and orders the plaintiff to appear for the deposition on a date to be determined. The plaintiff had previously failed to appear for the deposition and did not provide a valid reason for not appearing. The plaintiff had also changed his address, but did not provide a permanent address. The court had ordered the plaintiff to file a declaration regarding his permanent address, but the plaintiff failed to do so. As a sanction, the court orders the plaintiff to pay the defendant $3,660, which is the cost of the deposition.
