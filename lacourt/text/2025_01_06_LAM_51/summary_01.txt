And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the motion to quash the amendment to the complaint filed by Defendant Laura Hernandez. The amendment replaced Tom Mendes with Laura Hernandez, who was originally not a party to the lawsuit. The judge found that the amendment was procedurally defective and was made in bad faith, as Plaintiff Maria Garcia did not demonstrate true ignorance of Defendant Hernandez's identity. The judge also found that Plaintiff failed to provide evidence to support her claim that she forgot Defendant Hernandez's name. The judge granted the motion to quash, ordering that the amendment be stricken and that Plaintiff must re-file the lawsuit with the correct party names.
