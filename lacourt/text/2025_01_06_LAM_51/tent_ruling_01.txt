STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On December 15, 2023, Plaintiff Maria Garcia (Plaintiff)
filed a Complaint against Defendants Sam’s West, Inc. dba Sam’s Club and Tom
Mendes (Defendants) with seven causes of action for: (1) Disability
Discrimination in Violation of Gov. Code § 12940(a); (2) Failure to Accommodate
Disability in Violation of Gov. Code § 12940(m); (3) Failure to Engage in an
Interactive Process in Violation of Gov. Code § 12940(n); (4) Failure to
Prevent Discrimination in Violation of § 12940(k); (5) Harassment in Violation
of Gov. Code § 12940(j); (6) Retaliation in Violation of § 12940(h); and (7)
Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy.
 
According to the Complaint, Plaintiff worked for Defendants
and sustained work-related knee injuries that Defendants did not accommodate.
Plaintiff further alleges that her injury worsened requiring surgery and
Defendants terminated her employment while she was out on disability leave.
 
On February 23, 2024, Defendant Sam’s West, Inc. dba Sam’s
Club (Sam’s West) filed an Answer.
 
On August 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed a LACIV 105Amendment to
Complaint changing Tom Mendes to Laura Hernandez (Hernandez) which the court
GRANTED.
 
On August 26, 2024, Defendant Hernandez filed the instant
Motion to Quash. On December 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On
December 27, 2024, Defendant Hernandez filed a reply.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
A defendant may serve and file a notice of motion to quash
service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over
it.  (Code Civ. Proc. (CCP) § 418.10, subd. (a).)  CCP § 418.10
provides the exclusive procedure for challenging personal jurisdiction at the
outset.  (Roy v. Superior Court
(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 337, 342.)  Although the defendant is the moving
party, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to defeat the motion by
establishing that jurisdictional grounds exist.  (Mihlon v. Superior Court (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 703,
710.)  
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Defendant Hernandez contends Plaintiff’s Amendment to
Complaint is defective because it was not a name correction but the addition of
a completely new party, is procedurally defective, and is time barred. Plaintiff
argues the Amendment is proper, is not time barred, and requests leave to
substitute Defendant Hernandez as a “Doe” defendant in the alternative. Defendant
Hernandez replied that a Doe Amendment would be futile, Plaintiff did not
properly request leave to amend, and Plaintiff has not demonstrated true
ignorance of Defendant Hernandez’s identity.
 
CCP § 474 provides that “[w]hen the plaintiff is ignorant of
the name of a defendant, he must state that fact in the complaint . . . and
when his true name is discovered, the pleading . . . must be amended
accordingly . . . .” A motion to quash service may be brought where the terms
of CCP § 474 have not been met. (See Fireman’s
Fund Ins. Co. v. Sparks Const., Inc. (2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1135, 1145; McClatchy v. Coblentz, Patch, Duffy &
Bass, LLP (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 368, 375.) 
 
Here, Defendant Hernandez’s arguments are well taken. First,
Plaintiff purports to swap Defendant Hernandez as her manager in lieu of
Defendant Mendes because she forgot Defendant Hernandez’s name, not because
Plaintiff was “ignorant of the name” of that defendant. Indeed, Plaintiff’s
Amendment to Complaint indicates it is an “incorrect name” rather than a
fictitious name. Second, Plaintiff failed to provide evidence with her
opposition supporting her claim that she forgot Ms. Hernandez’s name. Plaintiff
relies on Woo v. Superior Court
(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 169, 180 (Woo) to
support her argument. This reliance is misplaced. The Woo Court “perceive[ed] an element of disingenuousness in [the
plaintiff’s] arguments.” While negligent ignorance is ok, Plaintiff must still
use CCP § 474 in good faith. (Woo, supra
at p. 179-180 [discussing Balon v. Drost
(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 483 (also a Doe amendment case).) Here, Plaintiff originally
alleged that Defendant Mendes berated her. (Complaint ¶ 17.) Now she claims
that Defendant Hernandez did so instead. As in Woo, it appears disingenuous that Plaintiff forgot who berated her
and Plaintiff provided no evidence to the court that the amendment is in good
faith.[1]

 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS the Motion to Quash.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Motion
to Quash is GRANTED.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
