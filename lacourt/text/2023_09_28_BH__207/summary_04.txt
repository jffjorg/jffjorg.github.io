And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Franklyn Ardon Cruz, has moved for an order to serve the defendant, Amera Enterprises, LLC, via the California Secretary of State. The motion is unopposed. The plaintiff's process server attempted to serve Amera's agent for service of process at the address registered with the California Secretary of State, but was unable to find the agent. The process server also took photographs showing that there was no signage for Amera at the location. The plaintiff located a second address for Amera's agent for service of process, but the current resident did not know the agent's current address.

The court grants the plaintiff's motion to serve Amera via the California Secretary of State, finding that the plaintiff has demonstrated reasonable diligence in attempting to serve Amera and Amera's agent for service of process without success. The plaintiff shall lodge a proposed order in conformance with the court's ruling on or before October 12, 2023, and shall provide notice of the court's ruling and file a proof of service regarding the same.
