[3] Substantive
unconscionability refers to agreement terms which are
overly harsh, unduly oppressive, unreasonably unfavorable, or so one-sided as
to shock the conscience – which, for practical purposes, all mean the same
thing.  (Sanchez, supra, 61
Cal.4th at p. 915.)   With regard to
demonstrating substantive unconscionability, an “old-fashioned bad bargain” or
a contract term which “merely gives one side a greater benefit” is
insufficient.  (Id. at pp.
911-912.)  The test for substantive
unconscionability is whether the terms impair the integrity of the bargaining
process or otherwise contravene public policy, or the terms “attempt to alter
in an impermissible manner fundamental duties otherwise imposed by the law” or
“negate the reasonable expectations of the nondrafting party.” (Sonic-Calabassas
A, Inc. v. Moreno (2013) 57 Cal.4th 1109, 1145; see also Carbajal v.
CWPSC, Inc. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 227, 247 [“outside the reasonable
expectation of the nondrafting party or is unduly oppressive”]; Dougherty, supra,
47 Cal.App.5th at pp. 104-107 [arbitration agreement that curtailed
plaintiffs’ ability to recover statutory remedies, such as punitive damages and
attorney fees, and contained limitations on discovery that risked frustrating
plaintiffs’ statutory elder abuse claims was substantively
unconscionable].)
