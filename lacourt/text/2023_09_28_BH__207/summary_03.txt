And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Counsel, William W. Steckbauer and Sean A. Topp, to be relieved as counsel for the defendants, Morteza Farzadmehr, Shahla Farzadmehr Delijani, and Morteza Farzadmehr as Trustee of Progressive Trust. The judge found that the motion is substantively proper under the Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 1.16(b)(4), as the breakdown of the attorney-client relationship has made it impossible for Counsel to continue representing the defendants effectively.

The judge also found that the motion is procedurally proper, as Counsel has complied with the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, and has properly served the clients and other parties in the action.

The defendants opposed the motion, citing the potential prejudice they may suffer from Counsel's withdrawal so close to trial. However, the judge noted that the trial is set for December 4, 2023, which provides ample time for new counsel to prepare, and that the defendants have the right to seek a continuance if necessary.

Accordingly, the judge has granted the motion and ordered Counsel to serve the signed orders on the defendants and all other parties who have appeared in the action within 10 days of the date of this order, and to file a proof of service of such.

## English Summary

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the motion filed by attorneys William W. Steckbauer and Sean A. Topp to be relieved as counsel for the defendants, Morteza Farzadmehr, Shahla Farzadmehr Delijani, and Morteza Farzadmehr as Trustee of Progressive Trust.
