And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a dispute between the plaintiff and defendant. The ruling states that both parties have failed to electronically file the referenced exhibits with their Notice of Lodgment, and therefore, they must file an Amended Notice of Lodgment with the exhibits attached forthwith.

The judge also addresses the issue of substantive unconscionability, which refers to contract terms that are overly harsh, oppressive, or one-sided. The judge notes that the test for substantive unconscionability involves determining whether the terms impair the integrity of the bargaining process or contravene public policy. The judge references several California court cases in support of this conclusion, including Sanchez v. Superior Court, Sonic-Calabassas A, Inc. v. Moreno, Carbajal v. CWPSC, Inc., and Dougherty v. CWPSC, Inc.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling aims to ensure that both parties comply with the rules governing electronic filing and that the arbitration agreement is fair and reasonable.
