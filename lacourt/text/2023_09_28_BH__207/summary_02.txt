And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a dispute between the plaintiff and defendant. The ruling states that both parties have failed to electronically file the referenced exhibits with their Notice of Lodgment, and therefore, they must file an Amended Notice of Lodgment with the exhibits attached forthwith.

The judge also addresses the issue of substantive unconscionability, which refers to contract terms that are overly harsh, oppressive, or one-sided. The judge notes that the test for substantive unconscionability involves determining whether the terms impair the integrity of the bargaining process or contravene public policy. The judge references several California court cases in support of this conclusion, including Sanchez v. Superior Court, Sonic-Calabassas A, Inc. v. Moreno, Carbajal v. CWPSC, Inc., and Dougherty v. CWPSC, Inc.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling aims to ensure that both parties comply with the rules governing electronic filing and that the arbitration agreement is fair and reasonable.

## English Text Summary

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a pending case.  The primary issue revolves around the proper filing of documents. Both the Plaintiff and Defendants failed to include all necessary exhibits with their Notices of Lodgment. As a result, the Judge orders them to file amended notices with all required exhibits attached.

The Judge also provides a legal definition and explanation of "substantive unconscionability" which is likely relevant to the case. This doctrine concerns contract terms that are excessively harsh, unfair, or one-sided. The Judge emphasizes that a simple "bad bargain" is not enough to demonstrate unconscionability; there must be evidence that the terms fundamentally undermine the fairness of the agreement or violate public policy.

**Summary:**
A tentative ruling has been issued by the Judge regarding a case involving a Plaintiff and a Defendant. The Judge has found that both the Plaintiff and the Defendant have failed to electronically file referenced exhibits with the Notice of Lodgment. The Judge has ordered both parties to file an Amended Notice of Lodgment with the referenced exhibits attached. The Judge has explained the concept of substantive unconscionability, stating that it refers to terms that are overly harsh, unduly oppressive, unreasonably unfavorable, or so one-sided that they shock the conscience. The Judge has also mentioned that an old-fashioned bad bargain or a contract term that merely gives one side a greater benefit is insufficient for substantive unconscionability. The test for substantive unconscionability is whether the terms impair the integrity of the bargaining process or otherwise contravene public policy, or alter fundamental duties or negate the reasonable expectations of the nondrafting party.
