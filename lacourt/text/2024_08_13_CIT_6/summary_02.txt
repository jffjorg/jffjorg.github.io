And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies Edward Damas' motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Martin Martinez without prejudice, but grants the motion if Damas only seeks to be relieved as counsel for Martin Martinez. The judge orders Damas to submit a properly completed proposed order that will be effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed order upon the client. The judge also notes that the motion is unopposed and that Damas has provided the requisite forms and declaration, but that the forms submitted have some defects. The judge's decision is based on the grounds that a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is sufficient grounds for permitting withdrawal, and that Damas has provided sufficient justification for seeking to be relieved as counsel.
