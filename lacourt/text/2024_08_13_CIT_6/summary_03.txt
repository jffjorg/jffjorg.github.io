And here is the summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Iris Lu v. Charles Ching Hsien Chen, et al. The case is a personal injury action filed on January 17, 2024. Charles Ching Hsien Chen has moved for leave to file a cross-complaint, which the Court has granted. Chen must file and serve the proposed cross-complaint within 10 days of the Court's order and file proof of service of same. Chen is also ordered to give notice of the Court's ruling within five calendar days of this order.

The Court's ruling is based on the fact that Chen's counsel was not fully aware of the facts of the incident at the time of the filing of the answer, and therefore did not file a cross-complaint for indemnity and property damage at the same time as the answer. The Court finds that Chen's motion is well-taken and that the interests of justice favor granting the motion to avoid forfeiture of Chen's causes of action. The Court also notes that there is no evidence of Chen acting in bad faith and that the lack of opposition to the motion is a tacit admission that Chen's arguments are meritorious.
