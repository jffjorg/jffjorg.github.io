RULING 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment.

            Plaintiff is also ordered to give

BACKGROUND 
This case is a business dispute. On November 18, 2022, plaintiff Yin
Chieh Chuang (Plaintiff) filed this action. On May 19, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the operative Second Amended Complaint (SAC) against defendant Jay Hooper aka
Jay Ho Hooper (Defendant) and Does 1 to 10, alleging the sole cause of action
for breach of contract. 
On April 22, 2024, Plaintiff moved for summary judgment. On July 24,
2024, Defendant opposed the motion. On July 25, 2024, Plaintiff replied. 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
The
purpose of a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication “is to provide
courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to
determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to
resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25
Cal.4th 826, 843.) “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), requires
the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and
‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by
other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of
law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119,
italics in original and quoting Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).) “The
function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the
scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to
disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited
by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th
59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d
367, 381-382.) 
“On a motion
for summary judgment, the initial burden is always on the moving party to make
a prima facie showing that there are no triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf
v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A plaintiff
moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication “has met his or her burden
of showing that there is no defense to a cause of action if that party has
proved each element of the cause of action entitling the party to judgment on
the cause of action. Once the plaintiff ... has met that burden, the
burden shifts to the defendant ... to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto. The
defendant … shall not rely upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings to
show that a triable issue of material fact exists but, instead, shall set forth
the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the
cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) “[A] plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion that ‘each element
of’ the ‘cause of action’ in question has been ‘proved,’ and hence that ‘there
is no defense’ thereto.” (Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 850, citing
Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (o)(1).)” 
Courts
“liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
PRELIMINARY
ISSUES 
            The
Court notes that the primary document upon which this contract is based is
partially written in Chinese. (Chuang Decl., Ex. A.) Even though the other half
of the contract appears to be its English translation, Plaintiff should still
have provided a certified translation per Rule 3.1110, subdivision (g), of the
California Rules of Court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1110, subd. (g).) The
Court will still consider the documents, but admonishes Plaintiff to comply
with the requirements of the California Rules of Court going forward. 
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS 
            The Court
OVERRULES all of Defendant’s objections. The Court also notes that Rule 3.1110,
subdivision (g), of the California Rules of Court is not a rule of evidence.
(See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1110, subd. (g).) 
            The Court OVERRULES Plaintiff’s first
objection to the Declaration of Defendant Jay Hooper. The Court SUSTAINS in
part Plaintiff’s second objection to the Declaration of Jay Hooper on the
grounds that it contains a legal conclusion with respect to the conclusion that
Hooper owes nothing with respect to the alleged agreement. (Snider v. Snider
(1962) 200 Cal.App.2d 741, 749 [conclusions of law or fact in a declaration
on summary judgment are insufficient as evidence].) 
DISCUSSION 
Summary of Material Facts 
Plaintiff invested $400,000.00 in a company called TRC
International Corp., of which Defendant was a principal. (Plaintiff’s SSF 1).
On November 18, 2024, the parties entered into a written agreement wherein
Defendant agreed to pay Plaintiff $234,000.00 according to the schedule set
forth in the agreement in exchange for Plaintiff’s claims and interest in TRC International
Corp. (Plaintiff’s SSF 2.) Defendant signed the agreement, acknowledged its
validity, and Plaintiff’s only obligation thereunder was to receive full
payment in exchange for his claims against and investment in TRC International
Corp. (Plaintiff’s SSF 2.) Defendant only paid $103,000.00 and owes Plaintiff
$131,000.00. (Plaintiff’s SSF 3.) 
Analysis 
“To prevail on a cause of action for breach of
contract, the plaintiff must prove (1) the contract, (2) the plaintiff's
performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the defendant's
breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the plaintiff.” (Richman v. Hartley (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.) 
Plaintiff contends he is entitled to summary judgment because he
has shown the existence of the contract, Plaintiff’s performance thereunder,
Defendant’s breach, and Plaintiff’s damages resulting from that breach. Plaintiff
contends he and Defendant entered into a written agreement wherein Defendant
would pay Plaintiff $234,000.00 according to the schedule set forth therein
(the Contract). (Plaintiff’s SSF 2.) Plaintiff contends Defendant signed and
acknowledged the Contract’s validity, and that Plaintiff’s only obligation
thereunder was to receive payment. (Plaintiff’s SSF 2.) Plaintiff contends Defendant
breached the Contract by only repaying $103,000.00 out of the $234,000.00
promised. (Plaintiff’s SSF 3.) 
The Court finds Plaintiff has met his moving burden. The
undisputed evidence shows that Plaintiff and Defendant entered into the
Contract for Defendant to repay Plaintiff $234,000.00 for Plaintiff’s
investment in TRC International Corp. (SSF 2.) The undisputed evidence further
shows that Defendant failed to repay Plaintiff $131,000.00 of that $234,000.00
balance. (SSF 3.) Moreover, none of the language in the Contract shows that
Plaintiff was obligated to transfer his ownership in TRC back to Defendant as a
condition of the repayment as Defendant contends. (See Chuang Decl., Ex. A;
Hooper Decl., ¶ 5.) Accordingly, the burden now shifts to Defendant to
establish the existence of a triable issue of material fact. 
The Court finds Defendant has failed to establish the
existence of a triable issue of material fact. None of the evidence Defendant
has presented here shows that the parties modified the Contract as Defendant
contends. (See Defendant’s Separate Statement, SSF No. 3.) “Modification is a
change in the obligation by a modifying agreement which requires mutual
assent.” (Wade v. Diamond A Cattle Co. (1975) 44 Cal.App.3d 453,
457.) Defendant has presented no evidence of mutual assent to support a
modification to the Contract, but instead has only provided legal conclusions,
which are insufficient to establish the existence of a triable issue of
material fact. (See Hooper Decl., ¶ 6; Trujillo v. First Am. Registry,
Inc. (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 628, 635, disapproved on other grounds by
Connor v. First Student, Inc. (2018) 5 Cal.5th 1026 [“To avoid
summary judgment, admissible evidence presented to the trial court, not merely
claims or theories, must reveal a triable, material factual issue. [Citation.]
Moreover, the opposition to summary judgment will be deemed insufficient when
it is essentially conclusionary, argumentative or based on conjecture and
speculation. [Citation.]”) It is not enough to simply say the parties agreed to
suspend and terminate the Contract; rather, Defendant needed to present specific
facts showing that Plaintiff agreed to the purported modification. Defendant
did not do that, and therefore fails to establish the existence of a triable
issue of material fact here. Defendant also contends that Plaintiff did not
return any of the partial monies paid to Plaintiff pursuant to the agreement.
(Hooper Decl., ¶ 5.) Thus, there is no evidence of any executed oral agreement
to cancel the November 18, 2018 written agreement. There is also no evidence of
any consideration given to support an alleged oral agreement to cancel the
written agreement. 
            Accordingly, the Court finds
Plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and GRANTS the motion for
summary judgment. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment.
Plaintiff is ordered to submit a proposed judgment within five calendar days of
the Court’s order. 
              Plaintiff is also ordered to give
notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
