And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment in this breach of contract case. The plaintiff, Yin Chieh Chuang, invested $400,000.00 in TRC International Corp, and the defendant, Jay Hooper, agreed to pay the plaintiff $234,000.00 according to a schedule set forth in a written agreement. However, the defendant only paid $103,000.00 and owes the plaintiff $131,000.00. The court finds that the plaintiff has met his burden of showing that there is no defense to the cause of action, and the defendant has failed to establish the existence of a triable issue of material fact. Therefore, the court grants the motion for summary judgment and orders the plaintiff to submit a proposed judgment within five calendar days of the court's order.
