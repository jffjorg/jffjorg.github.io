And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion of Micah Sanford and Jamie Cookes (Plaintiffs) to deem matters in Requests for Admissions, Set Two, admitted against Norma L. Gonzalez and Dany Steve Gonzalez (Defendants). The motion is untimely and the Court only has discretion to rule on it if Plaintiffs file a motion for leave to reopen discovery under Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050. Since Plaintiffs have not filed such a motion, the Court cannot rule on the motion to deem admitted. The Court continues to review the case and will consider the motion further at the hearing on January 10, 2024.
