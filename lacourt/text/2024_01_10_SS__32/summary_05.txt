And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash service of summons filed by Defendant Alfonso Montoya Del Real. The Defendant argues that the service was defective and lacks personal jurisdiction over him. The Plaintiff, Gilberto Vera, argues that he followed the proper procedures for serving the Defendant, but the Court finds that the evidence provided by the Plaintiff is insufficient to meet his burden of proving that the service was proper. The Court grants the motion and orders the Defendant to file a proof of service and provide notice.
