And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for summary judgment in a case where the plaintiff slipped and fell on a store floor. The plaintiff claims that the floor was "dangerously slippery" due to invisible water, but the judge finds that the plaintiff's own expert does not provide evidence on the floor material, and the photographs do not show water on the floor. The judge also notes that the caution sign in the bathroom does not demonstrate that the defendant knew or should have known about the presence of "invisible water". The judge is tentatively ruling that the plaintiff has not presented sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of fact, and that the case may be subject to summary judgment.
