And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion to reopen the case filed by Plaintiff Safeco Insurance Company of Illinois. The motion argues that the plaintiff failed to receive notice of the court's disposition of a previous request to vacate an OSC hearing and that they are unable to serve the defendants. The court notes that the plaintiff's request lacks legal authority and an attorney declaration regarding any mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. As a result, the court denies the motion to reopen the case. However, the court sets aside the previous dismissal and reinstates proceedings, citing a delay of less than two years in service of the summons and complaint as not being a ground for dismissal. The matter will be set for an Order to Show Cause Re: dismissal/monetary sanctions for failure to serve/alternatively Trial Setting Conference for March 11, 2024.
