Significant Statements:
  - "A party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."
  - "A plaintiff alleging injuries based on a dangerous condition must prove the defendant either created the dangerous condition or knew or should have known of the dangerous condition."
  - "A property owner is not the insurer of the safety of its guests. The owner's actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition is key to establishing liability."
  - "A review of relevant California case law provides a helpful spectrum to determine whether there was sufficient time for a defendant to conduct a reasonable inspection of the area."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is granting the defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that there are no triable issues of fact that the defendant had actual or constructive notice of a dangerous condition on the floor. The judge notes that the plaintiff did not see anything on the floor before or after the fall, and that the defendant's employee did not observe any water, liquid substance, or unsafe condition on the floor. The judge also rules that the plaintiff's expert inspection of the restroom was not sufficient to establish a triable issue of fact. The judge concludes that the defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted, and that the defendant shall file and serve a proposed judgment within 10 days.
