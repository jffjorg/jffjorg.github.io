And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel a response to Form Interrogatories, Set One and Special Interrogatories, Set One from the Defendant, Baten Windows Inc. The Plaintiff served the interrogatories on August 22, 2023, and the responses were due on September 26, 2023, but the Defendant failed to respond. The Defendant's counsel filed a declaration explaining the delay due to Mr. Acosta's hospitalization and personal medical issues. The Judge finds that the Defendant failed to serve timely responses and grants the motion to compel. The Judge also denies the Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions as it was not requested in the original notice of motion. The Defendant is ordered to provide verified responses within 10 days, and the Plaintiff is required to provide notice of the Court's order and file a proof of service of such.
