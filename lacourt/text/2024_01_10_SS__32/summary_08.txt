The judge's tentative ruling considers a motion filed by Plaintiff Adelmo Rivera's counsel, Christopher Dolan, Aimee Kirby, and the Dolan Law Firm, P.C., to be relieved as counsel. The motion is based on a breakdown in attorney-client communication. The court notes that no opposition has been filed, but that the Declaration in support of the motion was signed by Cioffi Remmer, who also appears as an attorney of record for Plaintiff. The court orders counsel to file an amended form MC-051 and MC-053, and to serve the updated motion and proposed order. The court conditionally grants the motion pending counsel's compliance with these requirements.
