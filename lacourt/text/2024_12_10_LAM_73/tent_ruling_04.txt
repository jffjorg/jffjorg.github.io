DEFENDANT’S motion to CONSOLIDATE CASES (filed 10/15/2024)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
The Court DENIES
Defendant’s Motion to Consolidate Cases. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
On April 2, 2024, Plaintiffs Emilee Crocker;
Emily Anderson; Jorge Bonilla; Angela Gregory; Grant  Goddard; Sumalai Ngowan; Maxwell Nabi; Gerard
Ross and Christian Ross filed this action against Defendant Carlo, Inc.
 
Plaintiffs allege the following causes of action:

1.     
Violations of the Investigative
Consumer Reporting Agencies Act (“ICRAA”), Civ. Code §§ 1786, et seq.
2.     
Invasion of Privacy
3.     
Declaratory Relief
 
The Complaint alleges the following. The ICRAA imposes
important procedural safeguards designed to protect persons like the
Plaintiffs, who applied to be tenants and residents at The Ridgeview
Apartments, The Esplanade Apartments, The Ritz Apartments, The Excelsior
Apartments and The Parkview Apartments, which are managed and operated by
Defendant Carlo, Inc. Plaintiffs allege Defendants violated the ICRAA because Defendant
did not provide a means by which the Plaintiffs could indicate that he or she
wished to receive a copy of any investigative consumer report prepared in
connection with their housing application. Defendant also did not agree to
provide a copy of any of the reports prepared about the Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs
are seeking damages, including actual damages, statutory damages and punitive
damages, and Plaintiffs are demanding declaratory relief and an injunction.
 
On October 15, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Consolidate, arguing:
·      
Defendant
seeks an order consolidating Case Nos. 24STCV08247, 24STCV10917, and 24STCV14466, for all
purposes.
·      
Defendant is the only defendant in all three cases
pending in the Los Angeles Superior Court.
·      
All plaintiffs in all three cases are represented by
Glenn A. Murphy of the Litigation Advocacy Group. Defendant Carlo is represented by Gordon & Rees
LLP.
·      
The cases involve identical allegations and claims by
plaintiffs
o  
In each lawsuit, plaintiffs identically contend that
they applied to an apartment complex managed by Carlo, by completing a
“mandatory multi-page ‘Application’” that stated that Carlo “may screen for
criminal background and previous evictions.” (See e.g., Cogger Decl., Ex. 7, ¶
21; Ex. 8, ¶ 36; Ex. 9, ¶ 21.) Plaintiffs further identically assert that Carlo
processed plaintiffs’ rental applications and requested investigative consumer
reports about each of the plaintiffs. (Id., Ex. 7, ¶ 22; Ex. 8, ¶ 37; Ex. 9, ¶
22.) However, plaintiffs assert that Carlo violated the ICRAA, in particular,
Civil Code, Sections 1786.2(b) and 1786.16(a)(3). (Id., Ex. 7, ¶¶ 3 &
37-38; Ex. 8, ¶¶ 3 & 52-53; Ex. 9, ¶¶ 3 & 37-38.) In support,
plaintiffs identically allege that Carlo did not provide a box to check, did
not provide a consent form or disclosure, did not provide copies of any of the
numerous reports obtained about the plaintiffs, and did not supply the names or
addresses of the investigative consumer reporting agencies making the reports.
(Id., Ex. 7, ¶¶ 37-38; Ex. 8, ¶¶ 52-53; Ex. 9, ¶¶ 37-38.)
o  
The Complaints Involve Tenants that Applied to the
Same Apartment Complexes.
§ 
Limited discovery to date shows that the application
and screening process at each of the apartments was substantially similar.
·      
Each case involves common law and facts
o   Each
lawsuit involves the same primary question of law: whether Carlo violated
certain provisions of the ICRAA in connection with any investigative consumer
report, requested in connection with Plaintiffs’ rental applications.
 
In
opposition, Plaintiff contends:
·       Defendant’s motion is fatally defective. 
·      
It is black letter law that cases must be related
before the Court can consider consolidating the cases. Pursuant to Local Rule 3.3 of the Los Angeles County
Superior, cases may not be consolidated unless they are in the same department.
·       Here,
on October 14, 2024, the Court decided that the Crocker, Pauli and Gutierrez
cases are not related. (Declaration of Glenn A. Murphy (“Murphy Decl.”), ¶ 2
and Ex. 1 [Order deeming cases not related].) Therefore, Defendant’s motion to
consolidate the cases must be denied as this Court previously decided the cases
are not related and the cases remain assigned to different Departments. Crocker
is assigned to Department 73, Pauli is assigned to Department 19 and Gutierrez
is assigned to Department 48.
 
 In reply, Defendant argues:
·      
Plaintiffs’ Opposition fails to identify a single
question of fact or law that is different in the three lawsuits.
·      
Code of Civil Procedure, Section 1048 does not mandate
that a motion to consolidate be brought only with respect to matters in the
same department. (See generally, Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd. (a).) Instead,
Section 1048 expressly permits a party to bring a motion to consolidate where
multiple actions are pending “before a court” (i.e., Los Angeles Superior).
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd. (a).)
 
ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal Standard
“When actions
involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may
order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the
actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders
concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or
delay.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd. (a).) “Coordination of civil actions
sharing a common question of fact or law is appropriate if one judge hearing
all of the actions . . . will promote the ends of justice taking into account
whether the common question of fact or law is predominating and significant to
the litigation; the convenience of the parties, witnesses, and counsel; the
relative development of the actions and the work product of counsel; the
efficient utilization; the calendar of the courts; the disadvantages of
duplicative and inconsistent rulings, orders, or judgments; and, the likelihood
of settlement of the actions without further litigation should coordination be
denied.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 404.1.)  
“The purpose
of consolidation is merely to promote trial convenience and economy by avoiding
duplication of procedure, particularly in the proof of issues common to both
actions.”  (Estate of Baker (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 471, 485
[citation omitted].) “A consolidation of actions does not affect the rights of
the parties.” (Ibid.)  Consolidation does not require identical
causes of action in each case, absolute identity of the parties, or identical
allegations. (Ibid.)  Where common issues are present in two cases
then consolidation is appropriate.  (Todd-Stenberg v. Dalkon Shield
Claimants Trust (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 976, 978-79.)   
B.      Discussion
 
Defendant
seeks to relate and consolidate the following cases: (1) Emilee Crocker v. Carlo, Inc. (Case No. 24STCV08247;
Filed: 4/02/2024); (2) Jessie Pauli v. Carlo, Inc. (Case No.
24STCV10917; Filed: 5/01/2024); and (3) Estefany Gutierrez v. Carlo, Inc.
(Case No. 24STCV14466; Filed: 6/10/2024).
 
As an initial matter, the Court notes that the instant Motion
to Consolidate Cases is procedurally deficient and does not comply with Los Angeles County Court Rules, Rule 3.3(g)(1). 
Los Angeles
County Court Rules, Rule 3.3(g)(1) provides that “[c]ases may not be
consolidated unless they are in the same department. A motion to consolidate
two or more cases may be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in
different departments, have been related in a single department, or if the
cases were already assigned to that department.”  
On October 14, 2024, the Court found that the following
cases, 24STCV08247 and 24STCV10917 and 24STCV14466, are not related within the
meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a). (Court’s 10/14/24 Minute
Order.) Defendant has not filed a motion for reconsideration or appealed the
Court’s order. Moreover, the cases are not assigned to the same department. Case No. 24STCV08247 is assigned to Department 73, Case No. 24STCV10917 is assigned to Department 19 and Case No.
24STCV14466 is assigned to Department 48. Therefore, the cases
cannot be consolidated because they are not in the same department and have not
been related in a single department.
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s
motion is DENIED.
 
DISPOSITION
 

The Court DENIES Defendant’s Motion to Consolidate Cases.
