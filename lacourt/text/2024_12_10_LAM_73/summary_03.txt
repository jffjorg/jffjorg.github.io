And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendant's motion to consolidate three cases (24STCV08247, 24STCV10917, and 24STCV14466) pending in the Los Angeles Superior Court. The judge finds that the cases are not related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a), and are not assigned to the same department. The defendant's motion does not comply with Los Angeles County Court Rules, Rule 3.3(g)(1), which requires that cases be consolidated only if they are in the same department. The judge notes that the purpose of consolidation is to promote trial convenience and economy by avoiding duplication of procedure, but in this case, the cases are not related and do not share a common question of law or fact. Therefore, the motion is denied.
