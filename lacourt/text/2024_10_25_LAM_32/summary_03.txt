Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed Plaintiff Jane Doe's motion to quash a subpoena served by Defendant Lockton Companies LLC – Pacific Series, et al. The subpoena seeks employment documents related to Plaintiff from her current employer, Alliant Insurance Services, Inc. The Court finds that the subpoena is reasonable and necessary for discovery, as it is directly relevant to the issues raised in the complaint.

The Court also finds that Plaintiff has not established a privacy interest in the requested documents, as they are within the scope of the protection provided by the state and federal Constitutions. A protective order will be issued to ensure that the requested documents are not used for improper purposes.

The Court denies Plaintiff's motion to quash the subpoena and orders that the requested documents be produced subject to a protective order.
