  Case No.:  24STCP01591
  Hearing Date:  October 25, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion for charging order 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On May 13, 2024, Plaintiff/Judgment
Creditor Maury Liwerant initiated this action by filing an application for
entry of judgment on sister-state judgment against Defendants/Judgment Debtors
David Scott Effress and Huckmuck LLC. The underlying judgment is from Colorado
state court. 
            On May 16, 2024, judgment was
entered in favor of Plaintiff against Defendants in the amount of $169,139.77. 
            On August 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion for a charging order on Trade Winds Three, LLC. 
LEGAL STANDARD
“If a money judgment is rendered against a
partner or member but not against the partnership or limited liability company,
the judgment debtor’s interest in the partnership or limited liability company
may be applied toward the satisfaction of the judgment by an order charging the
judgment debtor’s interest pursuant to Section 15907.03, 16504, or 17705.03 of
the Corporations Code.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.310.) “On application by a
judgment creditor of a member or transferee, a court may enter a charging order
against the transferable interest of the judgment debtor for the unsatisfied
amount of the judgment.” (Corp. Code, § 17705.03(a).) 
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff seeks a charging order
against Trade Winds Three, LLC, a company that Plaintiff claims is 100% owned
by Defendant Effress. For support, Plaintiff relies on her own declaration that
Defendant resides at a property in Topanga, California owned by the LLC.
(Liwerant Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. B.) Plaintiff further avers that the registered agent
of the LLC, George O’Campo, is a business associate of Defendant. (Id.,
¶ 5, Ex. C.) 
            This evidence is insufficient to
show that Defendant owns any interest in the LLC. First, Plaintiff lays no
foundation for her knowledge of where Defendant resides or who his associates
are. Second, the fact that Plaintiff resides at a property owned by the LLC and
is associated with an agent of the LLC shows nothing about Plaintiff’s
ownership interest in the LLC.
            Additionally, the motion was served
by mail even though Defendant and the LLC have not appeared in the case.
Initial service of pleadings and documents must be effectuated by one of the
methods prescribed in Code of Civil Procedure section 415.10 et seq.
Service by mail is permitted only for subsequent papers after a party has
appeared. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1013.) Thus, service was improper. 
Because Plaintiff has failed to prove that
Defendant Effress has any ownership interest in Trade Winds Three LLC, and
because the motion was improperly served, there is no basis for a charging
order against the company.  
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion for charging
order is DENIED.
