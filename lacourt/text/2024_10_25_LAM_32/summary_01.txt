And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a charging order on Trade Winds Three, LLC. The plaintiff had argued that the defendant, David Scott Effress, owns an interest in the LLC and sought to charge his interest to satisfy a judgment of $169,139.77 entered against him. However, the judge found that the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to support this claim and that the service of the motion was improper. As a result, the judge concluded that there is no basis for a charging order against the LLC.
