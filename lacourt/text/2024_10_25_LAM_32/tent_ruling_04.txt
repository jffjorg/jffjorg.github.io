  order RE:
defendant foxburg productions, llc’s
  demurrer and motion to strike 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On August 2, 2024, Plaintiffs
Shahbaz Farnad and Sharon Dann Farnad filed this action against Defendants
Foxburg Productions, LLC (Foxburg), Gilbert Hernandez (Hernandez), and Cinema
Security, Inc. (CSI). The complaint asserts causes of action for (1)
negligence, (2) negligent selection of contractor, (3) negligent hiring, and
(4) breach of contract. The complaint arises from the following facts.
            Plaintiffs allowed Foxburg to use
their residence for commercial filming and were assured by Foxburg that the
property would be protected by security. Foxburg retained CSI to provide
security. One of CSI’s guards, Richard Moya, is a convicted felon and was
caught on camera investigating restricted areas of the home where Plaintiffs’
valuables were located. Moya promptly left when he spotted a camera near a
wi-fi router. Three nights later, three individuals broke into the residence
and took $700,000 worth of property. These individuals targeted areas of the
home previously investigated by Moya and also disconnected the wi-fi router. Plaintiffs
allege that Defendants tipped off Moya to the location of Plaintiffs’
valuables, allowing Moya to case the property and help his accomplices
burglarize it.     
            On September 30, 2024, Foxburg filed
the instant demurrer and motion to strike against the complaint. Plaintiffs
filed their opposition on October 14, 2024. Foxburg filed its reply on October
18, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the
pleading or by proper judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd.
(a).) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior
Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
Any party, within the time allowed to
respond to a pleading, may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the
whole or any part of that pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b).) The
court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it
deems proper, strike (1) any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in
any pleading and (2) all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.
(Id., § 436.) The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face
of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Id., § 437.)
 
 
MEET AND CONFER
Before filing a demurrer or a motion to
strike, the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the
party who filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the
motion to strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be
reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.)
The Court notes that Defendant has complied with the meet and confer
requirement. (See Harwell Decl.)
DISCUSSION
I.
Demurrer
            a. Hirer Liability for
Independent Contractor’s Conduct 
            “As a general rule, a hirer of an
independent contractor is not liable for physical harm caused to others by the
act or omission of the independent contractor.” (J.L. v. Children's
Institute, Inc. (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 388, 400.) “[T]his doctrine of
nonliability ‘is founded on the principle that one person should not be
compelled to answer for the fault or neglect of another over whom he has no
control, and that the employer has a right to rely on the presumption that the
contractor will discharge his legal duties owing to his employees and third
persons.’” (Harold A. Newman Co. v. Nero (1973) 31 Cal.App.3d 490, 496.)

            There is “no authority for the
proposition that the hirer of an independent security agency is liable for the negligence
of the agency's employees.” (Johnson v. Ralphs Grocery Co. (2012) 204
Cal.App.4th 1097, 1107, emphasis in original.) However, “it appears that in
California the hirer of a detective agency for either a single investigation or
for the protection of property, may be liable for the intentional torts
of employees of the private detective agency committed in the course of
employment.” (Noble v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1973) 33 Cal.App.3d
654, 663, emphasis added.) “[A] litigant is vicariously liable for its
investigator's intentional misconduct committed within the course and
scope of employment.” (Stephen Slesinger, Inc. v. Walt Disney Co. (2007)
155 Cal.App.4th 736, 769, emphasis added.) 
            Foxburg argues that it cannot be
liable for the acts of Moya, an employee of the independent contractor, CSI.
However, Foxburg’s authorities pertain to negligent acts. Here, Moya’s acts
were intentional. Johnson, the case cited by Defendant, makes the
distinction between negligent and intentional acts. (See Johnson, supra,
204 Cal.App.4th at p. 1107.) The hirer in that case was immune because the
alleged acts were negligent. (Ibid.) “At common law, a person who hired
an independent contractor generally was not liable to third parties for
injuries caused by the contractor's negligence in performing the work.”
(Privette v. Superior Court (1993) 5 Cal.4th 689, 693, emphasis
added.) Because the alleged acts here were intentional, the rule of hirer
immunity for negligent acts does not preclude liability against Foxburg. 
            Additionally, as discussed further
below, Foxburg may be liable for negligently failing to protect Plaintiffs’
property even if it is not vicariously liable for Moya’s acts.   
            b. Duty of Care
            The elements of negligence are: (1) a duty to exercise ordinary care; (2)
breach of that duty; (3) causation; and (4) damages. (Ladd v. County of San
Mateo (1996) 12 Cal.4th 913, 917.) The existence and scope of a duty are
questions of law for the Court. (Artiglio v. Corning Inc. (1998) 18
Cal.4th 604, 614.) “A duty of care may arise . . . by contract. Alternatively,
a duty may be premised upon the general character of the activity in which the
defendant engaged, the relationship between the parties or even the
interdependent nature of human society.” (J'Aire Corp. v. Gregory (1979)
24 Cal.3d 799, 803.) 
            Plaintiff
alleges that Foxburg had a duty to “act reasonably within the standard of care
in securing the Residence and Plaintiffs’ personal property.” (Compl. ¶ 20.)
Specifically, Plaintiffs’ agreement with Foxburg states that Foxburg would “leave
said premises and all property of any kind located thereon in as good order and
condition as they were immediately prior to any use of said premises” and
“protect [Dr. Farnad] and to keep and save [Dr. Farnad] harmless from any and
all . . . loss or liabilities for any personal injury to any person or any
actual damage to other premises or property located thereon.” (Id., ¶
15, Ex. A.) Foxburg also assured Plaintiffs that it would hire a security firm
to protect the residence and its contents. (Id., ¶ 16.) 
            The
contract, “the general character of the activity in which the defendant
engaged,” and “the relationship between the parties” in this particular case
support a duty on Foxburg to ensure adequate protection for Plaintiffs’ home
and belongings. (See J’Aire, supra, 24 Cal.3d at p. 803.) Whether
Foxburg satisfied that duty of care when it hired CSI is a factual matter
unsuited for resolution on a demurrer. (See Lawrence v. La Jolla Beach &
Tennis Club, Inc. (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 11, 32 [“breach of . . . duty and
causation are ordinarily questions of fact for the jury's determination”].) For
pleading purposes, the allegations sufficiently establish that Foxburg breached
its duty of care by retaining an incompetent security agency without proper vetting.
(See Compl. ¶ 25.) The burglary was a foreseeable consequence of this failure. 
            c. Breach of Contract
            To
establish breach of contract, a plaintiff must show: (1) the contract existed,
(2) the plaintiff’s performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance,
(3) the defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the plaintiff. (Richman
v. Hartley (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.) 
            As
discussed above, the contract term at issue provides that Foxburg would leave
the premises in the condition it was in before the filming, and Foxburg would
protect Dr. Farnad from damage to the premises or the property within. (Compl.
¶ 15, Ex. A.) Foxburg argues that it was simply obligated to hire security,
which it did. However, the contract term does not require Foxburg to simply
hire security; it requires Foxburg to protect the premises and Plaintiffs’
belongings. Whether Foxburg satisfied this contract term by hiring CSI is a
factual matter. For pleading purposes, the complaint sufficiently establishes
that Foxburg breached its contractual obligation to protect the property when
it hired an incompetent security agency without proper vetting.
II. Motion to
Strike
Emotional damages are not recoverable in
every case where there is an underlying claim for negligence. (Gravillis v.
Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage Co. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 761, 777.)
“No California case has allowed recovery for emotional distress arising solely
out of property damage, absent a threshold showing of some preexisting
relationship or intentional tort.” (Cooper v. Superior Court (1984) 153
Cal.App.3d 1008, 1012.) Courts consider the nature of the relationship between
the parties, along with surrounding circumstances. (See Windeler v. Scheers
Jewelers (1970) 8 Cal.App.3d 844, 850-52.) 
Foxburg seeks to
strike Plaintiffs’ prayer for general damages on the grounds that such damages
are generally unavailable in property damage cases. However, emotional distress
damages are available if they are a foreseeable result of a defendant’s conduct
based on the relationship of the parties and the surrounding circumstances.
(See Ross v. Forest Lawn Memorial Park (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 988, 992 [cemetery's
agreement to keep burial service private and to protect grave from vandalism]; Windeler,
supra, 8 Cal.App.3d at pp. 851-52 [bailment for heirloom jewelry where
jewelry's great sentimental value was made known to bailee]; Wynn v.
Monterey Club (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 789, 799-801 [agreement of two gambling
clubs to exclude husband's gambling-addicted wife from clubs and not to cash
her checks].) 
Here, Foxburg allegedly agreed to protect
Plaintiffs’ residence and belongings. (Compl. ¶ 15.) Plaintiffs allegedly
allowed Foxburg to use the residence for filming upon Foxburg’s assurances that
their home and property would be protected. (Id., ¶ 16.) Plaintiffs
allege that they were traumatized by the invasion of their home because they
feared for their safety and the safety of their child. (Id., ¶ 4.)
Plaintiffs also allege that they suffered emotional distress as a result of the
theft of their personal belongings with significant sentimental value. (Id.,
¶ 18.)
It may be reasonably inferred from these
allegations that emotional distress was a foreseeable consequence of Foxburg’s
failure to adequately protect the premises. The relationship between the
parties and the circumstances surrounding Foxburg’s use of the home support the
recovery of general damages as in Ross, Windeler, and Wynn.

CONCLUSION
            Defendant Foxburg’s demurrer is
OVERRULED. Foxburg’s motion to strike is DENIED.
