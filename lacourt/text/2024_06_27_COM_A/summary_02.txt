And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting in part the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for admission from the Defendants, Mayra Paloma Garcia Vela and Ruben Garcia Rodriguez. The Plaintiff had served the requests on August 14, 2023, and the Defendants had served incomplete and improper responses on April 15, 2024. The Plaintiff had made numerous attempts to contact the defense counsel for further responses, but the counsel had "rebuffed" the attempts. The Judge found that the Plaintiff's motions were timely filed and served, and that the Defendants had failed to respond properly. The Judge granted the motions, ordering the Defendants to provide further verified responses to specific requests within 20 days. The Judge also denied the Plaintiff's request for imposition of sanctions against each Defendant, as the Plaintiff's counsel's declaration did not provide sufficient facts to support the amount of any monetary sanction sought.
