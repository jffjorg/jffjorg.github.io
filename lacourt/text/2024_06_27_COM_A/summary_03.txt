And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling continues the hearing on Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to their request for production of documents. The Plaintiff, Victor D. Martinez, et al, alleges that Defendant American Honda Motor Company issued a written express warranty for their 2022 Honda Accord, but the vehicle's "sensing" function was defective and impaired its use. The Defendant failed to comply with its statutory obligations to replace the vehicle or pay restitution after failing to repair the defects. The Plaintiff alleges four separate violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and a cause of action for fraud and concealment. The Court previously ordered the parties to review and read the Addendum to the Case Management Conference Order and meet and confer to determine if the issues raised by the Plaintiff's motion were addressed. However, neither party complied with the court's order. Therefore, the hearing is continued to July 23, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., and the parties are ordered to comply with the court's order and file a one-page supplemental brief 10 days before the hearing date.
