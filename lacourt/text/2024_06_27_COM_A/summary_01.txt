And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's response to the request for production of documents, set two. The case arises from an auto accident in which the plaintiff allegedly sustained injuries. The plaintiff's counsel was relieved as attorney of record on May 2, 2024, and the defendant served the second set of requests for production of documents on March 29, 2024. Although the defendant agreed to extend the time for response, the plaintiff did not respond despite the extension. The defendant sent a letter to the plaintiff requesting responses within 10 days, but the plaintiff did not respond. The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to timely respond to the request for production of documents results in a waiver of objections. The court grants the defendant's motion and orders the plaintiff to serve verified responses without objections to the request for production of documents, set two, within 10 days.
