[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING

 FURTHER RESPONSE TO REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION, SET ONE; REQUEST FOR IMPOSITION OF
 SANCTIONS
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING IN
 PART PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL DEFENDANT, RUBEN GARCIA RODRIGUEZ’S RESPONSE
 TO REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION, SET ONE; REQUEST FOR IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS
 
 
      This is a
negligence action arising from alleged injuries suffered by Plaintiff in an
auto accident. On August 14, 2023, Plaintiff served Requests for Admission, Set
One, on each Defendant. Plaintiff argues that both defendants served improper
and incomplete responses on April 15, 2024. Plaintiff has made numerous
attempts to contact defense counsel for further responses, but defense counsel
“rebuffed” Plaintiff’s attempts.    
      A
party may move for an order compelling further responses to requests for
admission if the requesting party deems that the responses are evasive or
incomplete or an objection is without merit or too general. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.290.)  Plaintiff timely filed and served the motions,
allowing 45 days notice of the motion, plus two court days for electronic
service. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (c); Code
Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(4)(A).) Defendants did not
file an opposition. 
      While
Plaintiff requests imposition of sanctions against Defendants and counsel for
fees and costs incurred for each motion, Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration does
not  “set[] forth facts supporting the
amount of any monetary sanction sought.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.040.)
      Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s two motions to compel further responses to
requests for admission are GRANTED. Defendant, Ruben Garcia Rodriguez,  is ordered to provide further verified
responses without objection to requests 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27,
28, 29, 30, 31, and 32 within 20 days. Defendant, Mayra Paloma Garcia Vela, is
ordered to provide further verified responses without objection to requests Nos.
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 within 20 days.
      Plaintiff’s
request for imposition of sanctions against each Defendant is DENIED.
