[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING
 DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO COMPEL PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF
 DOCUMENTS, SET TWO
 
      This
action arises from injuries Plaintiff allegedly sustained in an auto accident. On
May 2, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel served notice on the client that court granted
counsel’s motion to be relieved as attorney of record. 
      On
March 29, 2024, Defendant served a second set of requests for production of
documents on Plaintiff’s former counsel. Defendant agreed to extend time to
respond as Plaintiff’s counsel intended to withdraw. 
      Defense
counsel sent a letter to Plaintiff on May 15, 2024, requesting responses within
10 days. Plaintiff did not respond. Although Defendant timely filed and served
this motion, Plaintiff did not file an opposition.
      Where a party
fails to timely respond to a document request, the court has authority to
compel a response. (Code Civ. Proc., §2031.300(b).) Untimely responses result
in a waiver of objections. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300(a).)
      Accordingly,
Defendant’s motion is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses
without objections to Request for Production of Documents , Set Two, within 10
days. Defendant did not request imposition of sanctions, therefore, none are awarded.
