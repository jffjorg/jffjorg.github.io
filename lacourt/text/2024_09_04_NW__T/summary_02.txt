And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions in limine and the motion to compel deposition in the case of Barragan v FCA. The plaintiff's motions in limine 1-5 were filed without opposition and are granted. The judge also denied the motion to produce documents at deposition because a separate statement was not filed as required by CRC 3.1345. The judge assessed a monetary sanction of $250 against Clark Hill for failing to comply with the court's order of February 26, 2024. The judge advanced the hearing on the motion to compel deposition to September 10, 2024. The judge also noted that the deposition of the PMQ was taken on August 13, 2024, and is now moot. Finally, the judge stated that the trial date will not be removed from the calendar unless the parties confirm that the case has been settled, and not just that negotiations are ongoing.
