And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions in limine filed by both the plaintiff and the defendant in this case. The defendant's motions were largely granted, with the exception of the motion to exclude evidence of the plaintiff's one-time and unreported complaints, which was denied. The defendant's motions sought to exclude a wide range of evidence and arguments, including evidence of alleged "similar incidents", the defendant's size and financial condition, and references to unrelated emissions litigation.

The plaintiff's motions, on the other hand, were more limited in scope. The court denied the plaintiff's motion to exclude legal opinions regarding the applicability of warranty coverage, as well as motions to exclude evidence and testimony related to the vehicle's mileage and the plaintiff's alleged misuse or abuse of the vehicle. The court granted the plaintiff's motion to exclude references to post-litigation settlement offers, unless a 402 hearing is held to identify what statements may be admissible.

The court also instructed the jury on the law regarding the parties' duties and prohibited any discussion of the law in opening statements unless it is specifically related to a jury instruction that has been agreed upon by the parties or previously granted by the court. The court further prohibited any misstatement of the relative duties of the parties without permission.
