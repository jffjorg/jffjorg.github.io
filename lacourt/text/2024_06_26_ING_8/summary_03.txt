The judge has also overruled the demurrer as to the negligent misrepresentation, fraudulent concealment, and breach of implied warranty of habitability causes of action, finding that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged these causes of action.

The judge has granted the demurrer as to the first cause of action for intentional misrepresentation related to parking and electrical/appliances, finding that the plaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege intentional misrepresentation related to this issue.
