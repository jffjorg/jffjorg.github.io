And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a demurrer to a complaint filed by Plaintiff ELMIRA APREIAN against Defendants CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD, et al. The case involves a slip and fall incident that allegedly occurred on a sidewalk adjacent to a multi-use residential property owned and managed by Los Angeles County Development Authority (LACDA) in the City of West Hollywood. Plaintiff claims that LACDA failed to maintain the sidewalk and is liable for her injuries. LACDA argues that it is immune from common law torts, including negligence, and that Plaintiff's complaint does not provide sufficient facts to support a claim for negligence.

The court agrees with LACDA's arguments and sustains its demurrer to the complaint with 20 days' leave to amend. The court finds that Plaintiff's complaint does not state a cause of action for negligence and that Plaintiff has not alleged any facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for vicarious liability against LACDA. The court also finds that Plaintiff's complaint does not identify any employee of LACDA who allegedly acted negligently and that Plaintiff has not shown that any acts or omissions of a LACDA employee were not immune under Government Code § 815.2 and § 820.2.

The court notes that Plaintiff's complaint cites no statute that would permit a claim for negligence and that Plaintiff has not alleged any facts sufficient to support a claim for dangerous condition of public property. The court also finds that Plaintiff's argument that the complaint uses Judicial Counsel approved forms and is therefore not subject to demurrer is unsupported by authority.
