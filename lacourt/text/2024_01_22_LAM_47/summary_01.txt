And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to special interrogatories from defendant Sunhee Yi. The court sustained defendant Yi's demurrer to the complaint in its entirety without leave to amend on the basis that she is not the owner of the subject property, and thus is not the proper party against whom the plaintiff's claims must be asserted. As a result, the plaintiff is not entitled to compel responses to interrogatories from defendant Yi. The court finds that the plaintiff's motion is denied under California Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.010, which authorizes written interrogatories only with respect to parties. The hearing on this matter is scheduled for January 22, 2024, and any party may submit on the tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email by 4:00 p.m. the day before the hearing.
