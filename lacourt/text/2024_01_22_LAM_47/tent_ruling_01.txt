CASE
HISTORY:
·        
04/18/23: Complaint filed. 
·        
12/15/23: Demurrer sustained without leave to
amend as to named Defendants Ock J. Kim and Sunhee Yi.
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a habitability action. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants refused
to repair persistent defects at the property in which Plaintiff was a tenant,
including termite infestations and plumbing issues. 
 
Plaintiff moves to compel responses
to special interrogatories propounded to Sunhee Yi.
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff moves to compel responses
to special interrogatories propounded to Sunhee Yi.
 
On December 15, 2023, this Court
sustained Defendant Yi’s demurrer to the complaint in its entirety without
leave to amend on the basis that she is not the owner of the subject property,
and thus is not the proper party against whom Plaintiff’s claims must be
asserted. Plaintiff is therefore not entitled to compel responses to
interrogatories from Sunhee Yi. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.010 [authorizing
written interrogatories with respect to parties only].) 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to
Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories is DENIED. 
 
Moving Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
