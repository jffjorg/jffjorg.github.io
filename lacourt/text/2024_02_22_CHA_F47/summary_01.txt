And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion filed by the Ricci Defendants (Elizabeth Ann Ricci, Richard Ricci, and Neil Ricci) for leave to file a cross-complaint against Defendant Robert Brown. The cross-complaint seeks indemnity, contribution, apportionment of fault, and declaratory relief against Brown and unknown parties (Roes 1-50). The motion was filed on September 15, 2023, and no opposition has been filed. The Judge concludes that the proposed cross-complaint is not compulsory and that the Ricci Defendants are not required to obtain leave of court to file it. The Judge also finds that it is in the interest of justice and judicial economy to allow the Ricci Defendants to file and serve their proposed cross-complaint. The Ricci Defendants are ordered to separately file the proposed Cross-Complaint.
