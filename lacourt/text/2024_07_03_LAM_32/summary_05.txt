And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling is a summary of the court's thinking based on the information presented before the hearing. The case is about a wrongful death lawsuit filed by Haley Chapman, individually and as successor-in-interest to Noelle Glotfelty, who died by suicide in a Marriott hotel room. The lawsuit is against various defendants, including Marriott International, Inc. The court has been asked to exclude certain testimony given by Brett Scott, a defendant, after he made changes to his deposition testimony. The court has determined that Scott did not make the changes within the 30-day deadline allowed by law, and therefore the deposition is treated as having been approved without changes. The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to exclude the corrected deposition testimony, stating that the plaintiff's motion is premature and that any objections to the testimony can be made at the appropriate time during the trial.
