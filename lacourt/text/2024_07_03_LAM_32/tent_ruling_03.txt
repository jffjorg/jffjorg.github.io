     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motions to compel further
  responses 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On April 28, 2023, Plaintiffs Lexi
Burrows and Brooklynn Lundberg filed this employment action against Defendants
Touchstone Golf, LLC, Ashley Walston, Peter Wagner, and the City of Burbank.
Plaintiffs assert claims stemming from harassment, discrimination and
retaliation, wrongful termination, and wage violations. Plaintiffs allege that
they experienced and spoke out against sexual harassment and discrimination,
and reported illegal or unsafe working conditions, only to suffer retaliation
for doing so. 
            On March 11, 2024, the Court denied
the motion to compel arbitration filed by Defendants Touchstone Golf, LLC and
City of Burbank. Defendants have appealed that decision. On April 24, 2024, the
Court granted Defendants’ motion to stay the proceedings pending the appeal but
allowed discovery to continue.  
            On June 5, 2024, Plaintiff Burrows
filed the instant two motions to compel further responses to her Requests for
Production. Defendants filed their oppositions on June 20, 2024. Plaintiff
filed her replies on June 24, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Upon receiving responses to its discovery
requests, the propounding party may move for an order compelling further
responses if the responses are incomplete or evasive, or objections are without
merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(a), 2031.310(a),
2033.290(a).) 
MEET AND CONFER
A motion to compel further must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration demonstrating an attempt to
resolve the matter informally. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(b)(1),
2031.310(b), 2033.290(b).) The Court finds that Plaintiff has satisfied the meet
and confer requirement. (See Schein Decl.)
DISCUSSION
            The deadline for serving a motion to
compel further responses is 45 days after receipt of the responses. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.290(c).) The deadline is extended by two court days if responses
are served electronically. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6(a)(3)(B).) If the
deadline falls on a weekend or holiday, the deadline is extended to the next
court day. (Id., § 2016.060.) The service deadline is “mandatory and
jurisdictional.” (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403,
1410.)    
            Here, Defendants served their
responses by email on April 18, 2024. (Tong Decl., Ex. B.) Counting forty-five
days, plus two court days for electronic service, results in a deadline of
Tuesday, June 4, 2024. Section 2016.060 only applies if “the last day to
perform or complete any act provided for in this title falls on a Saturday,
Sunday, or holiday.” The “last day” to perform an action necessarily accounts
for applicable extensions. Here, the “last day” to file a motion to compel was
Tuesday, June 4, 2024 after accounting for the two-court-day extension for
electronic service. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2033.290(c), 1010.6(a)(3)(B).) Because
June 4, 2024 was neither a weekend nor holiday, section 2016.060 was not
triggered. Thus, the deadline was June 4, 2024. 
            Plaintiff argues that the holiday
rule was triggered on Sunday, June 2, 2024, or 45 days from April 18, 2024.
This would mean that the deadline was extended to Monday, June 3, 2024.
Plaintiff then applies the two-court-day extension for electronic service,
making the final deadline Wednesday, June 5, 2024. This calculation overlooks
the language of section 2016.060, which applies the holiday rule only if the
“last day” to perform an act falls on a weekend or holiday.[1]
Sunday, June 2, 2024 was not the “last day” to serve the motion to compel in
this case because the Code grants a two-court-day extension for electronic
service. As discussed above, the actual “last day” to serve a motion to compel
in this case was June 4, 2024 because of that two-day extension. Since June 4,
2024 was neither a weekend nor holiday, section 2016.060 was not triggered. Therefore,
the deadline to serve the motions was June 4, 2024.
Plaintiff did not serve her motions until
June 5, 2024, rendering them untimely. This “renders the court without
authority to rule on [the] motions to compel other than to deny them.” (Sexton,
supra, 58 Cal.App.4th at p. 1410.) 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motions to compel
further responses are DENIED. Sanctions are denied as the parties acted with
substantial justification.
