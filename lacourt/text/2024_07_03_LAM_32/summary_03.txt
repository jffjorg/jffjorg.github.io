Here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge in the case of Lexi Burrows and Brooklynn Lundberg, the plaintiffs, against Touchstone Golf, LLC, Ashley Walston, Peter Wagner, and the City of Burbank, the defendants. The plaintiffs filed motions to compel further responses to their discovery requests, which were served after the deadline. The judge finds that the motions are untimely and denies them. The judge also notes that the parties acted with substantial justification and therefore denies sanctions. The case involves allegations of harassment, discrimination, and retaliation, and the judge has previously denied the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and granted a stay of proceedings pending appeal.
