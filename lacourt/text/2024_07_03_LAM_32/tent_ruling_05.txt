                        Defendants.
  


 
  Case No.:  23STCV03486
  Hearing Date:  July 3, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to exclude corrected
  deposition testimony




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On February 16, 2023, Plaintiff
Haley Chapman, individually and as successor-in-interest to Noelle Glotfelty
(Decedent), filed this action against various Defendants for (1) wrongful
death, (2) survival cause of action, and (3) negligence. The complaint stems
from the death of Decedent, who committed suicide inside a Marriott hotel room.

            On December 14, 2023, Plaintiff took
the deposition of Defendant Brett Scott. At the end of the deposition, both
parties acknowledged that Scott would have 30 days to review and submit changes
to his testimony, in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.520.
The court reporter released the transcript on December 30, 2023. However, Scott
did not issue an errata sheet until March 27, 2024. 
            On June 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant motion to preclude any reference to or use of Scott’s late corrected
testimony. Defendant County of Ventura filed its opposition on June 20, 2024. Plaintiff
filed her reply on June 26, 2024.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
For 30 days following notice by the
deposition officer, “unless the attending parties and the deponent agree on the
record or otherwise in writing to a longer or shorter time period, the deponent
may change the form or the substance of the answer to a question, and may
either approve the transcript of the deposition by signing it, or refuse to
approve the transcript by not signing it.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.520(b).) “If
the deponent fails or refuses to approve the transcript within the allotted
period, the deposition shall be given the same effect as though it had been
approved, subject to any changes timely made by the deponent.” (Id., §
2025.520(f).) 
DISCUSSION
            Here, the court reporter sent the
requisite notice on December 30, 2023. (Maxwell Decl., Ex. B.) It is undisputed
that Scott did not issue an errata sheet until March 27, 2024, past the 30 days
allowed by section 2025.520(b). (Id., Ex. C.) There is no indication
that the parties agreed to a longer time period. Thus, Scott’s correction was
untimely. Because Scott did not make any timely changes and did not approve the
transcript within 30 days, the deposition is treated as having been approved
without changes. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.520(f).) The Code contains no
exceptions to its mandate that changes be made within the specified time period,
even for good faith or substantial justification.  
            However, section 2025.520 also contains
no remedy provision addressing a deponent’s untimely correction. Plaintiff
argues that the Court should issue an order precluding the use of the corrected
transcript. Plaintiff cites Fredianelli v. Jenkins (N.D.Cal. 2013) 931
F.Supp.2d 1001, 1008, where the court sustained the defendant’s objections to
the plaintiff’s untimely deposition corrections. However, this was done on
summary judgment when the plaintiff attempted to admit his corrected testimony
as evidence. The Court agrees with Defendant that an issue does not arise
unless and until a party attempts to admit untimely corrections as evidence on
a motion or at trial. Plaintiff’s present motion amounts to a premature motion in
limine. 
            Plaintiff argues that the Court
should issue an order to “limit the damage beforehand.” However, it is unclear
what damage could be caused before Defendants attempt to use the corrected
testimony as evidence. If Defendants do attempt to use the revised transcript
as evidence, Plaintiff may object as the defendant did in Fredianelli, or
file a motion in limine at the appropriate time. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to exclude
corrected deposition testimony is DENIED.
