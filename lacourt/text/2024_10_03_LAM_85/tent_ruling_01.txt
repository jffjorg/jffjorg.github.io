  Case Number:  22STCP01678    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2024    Dept:  85 
 
Center
International Investments, Inc. vs. City of Monterey Park,
22STCP01678 

Tentative decision on motion
to be relieved as counsel:  granted



 
            
Whitney A. Hodges (“Hodges”) and Allison C. Wong (“Wong”) of
the law firm Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton LLP (“Sheppard Mullin”) moves
for an order relieving them as counsel for Petitioner Center International
Investments (“Center”).
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers (no opposition was filed) and renders
the following tentative decision. 
            
            A. Statement of the Case
1. First Amended Petition 
Center
commenced this action on May 3, 2022.  The operative pleading is the First
Amended Petition  (“FAP”), filed on August 31, 2022, alleging (1)
administrative and traditional mandamus based on the Housing Accountability Act
(“HAA”), (2) traditional mandamus based on a temporary and permanent taking
under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, (3) inverse condemnation, (4)
violation of substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S.
Constitution, (5) violation of the Equal Protection Clause under the Fourteenth
Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, (6) violation of mandatory duties under
Government Code (“Govt. Code”) section 815.6, (7) traditional mandamus, and (8)
administrative and traditional mandamus for violation of the Housing Crisis Act
(“HCA”).   
The
FAP alleges in pertinent part as follows. 
 
a.
Background 
In
1978 and 1979, Good Views Land Development Company (“Good Views”) received
approval to develop 31 residential units on the Property.  In 1983, the
Property’s slope failed, which blocked and damaged Garvey Avenue.  The
City took emergency action to construct soil stabilizations and drainage
infrastructure. 
In
1986, the City and Good Views entered into an agreement to construct permanent
structures for the stabilization of the Property’s hillside.  Although
City consultants advised various measures to stabilize the hillside from 1987
to 1989, Good Views did not implement any of them.  As a result, it failed
to adequately remediate the issues with the hillside.   
In
1991, the City issued a notice of violation to Good View that the hillside is a
public nuisance requiring abatement.  Between 1991 and 1997, Good Views
abandoned the Property.  In 1997, the City Council declared the Property a
public nuisance and began to abate the Property itself.  The City took
abatement actions in 2000 and 2002. 
In
2013, Center became the new Property owner, and the City commenced enforcements
actions against it.  In 2015, predictions of El Niño storms led the City
to believe that significant slope failure could occur on the Property.  On
December 31, 2015, the City filed suit for abatement against Center, The
People of the State of California, ex rel., Mark D. Hensley, City Attorney for
the City of Monterey Park v. Center Int’l Investments, Inc., (“Abatement
Case”) (2015), Case No. BC605788.   
On
April 25, 2017, the parties entered into a Settlement Agreement for the
Abatement Case which addressed a long-term solution to the Property’s
instability.  Under the Settlement Agreement, Center would implement a
City-approved interim erosion control and slope stabilization plan until
permanent remediation was possible.  Permanent remediation would consisted
of a series of retaining walls and other geotechnical solutions.  The
permanent remediation could be either be integrated into the development of a residential
community (“Plan A”) or implemented before any such development on the Property
(“Plan B”).  Performance under Plan B was due to be performed by 2022 even
if the City Council did not approve Plan A.  If Center failed to comply,
the City could complete Plan B at Center’s expense. 
 
b.
2017-19 Efforts to Perform the Settlement Agreement 
On
April 28, 2017, the City confirmed receipt of Center’s application for two
tentative tract maps to subdivide the Property into 19 single-family residences
and 14 condominium units.  After much delay from the City in reviewing the
application, on September 13, 2017, Center met with City and AECOM, the City’s
third-party consultant responsible for review of the application.  The
City recommended that Center hire its own third-party consultant to finish the
review. 
On
March 1, 2018, Center met with City representatives to discuss the entitlements
necessary for development of the Project.  The next day, the City replaced
AECOM with a new third-party consultant, Converse Consultants. 
On
March 26, 2018, the City advised Center to change the number of proposed units
to “TBD” because there were too many open issues with geotechnical to determine
a definitive number of residential units.  On May 3, 2018, the City
reported that the specific plan for the Project was not advancing because the
site plan, geotechnical issues, and number of units were still up in the
air. 
On
July 10, 2018, the City reported that it had again switched third-party
consultants to Geosyntech.  It also explained that recent issues with the
General Plan’s Land Use Element (“LUE”) would affect the City Council’s
authority to approve plans or variances for the Project.  
On
February 14, 2019, Center provided the City with milestones for the proposed
entitlements and development.  The City Attorney responded that the City
was done discussing timelines.  The next day, the City Attorney informed
Center it would send a notice of default and demand for voluntary
abatement.  The City Attorney then recanted and directed City staff to
work with Center to revise the Settlement Agreement’s timeline.  The
parties executed an amendment to that effect on March 22, 2019. 
Center
retained KCM as the Project manager.  On July 29, 2019, the City informed
KCM that any development needed 25 dwelling units to comply with a pending LUE
update.  This drastic change to the site plan would make it impossible to
comply with the amended milestones.  The City chose not to put the LUE
proposition on the 2019 ballot because it was cost prohibitive.  This left
Center’s Project in limbo.  Although the City later introduced a new
proposed LUE (“Measure II”), the electorate rejected it in March
2020.   
On
June 17, 2020, the City Council approved a proposition for a new LUE (“Measure
JJ”).  The electorate voted in favor of Measure JJ in November 2020, which
changed the Property’s zoning. 
 
c.
Subsequent Settlement Performance Efforts  
On
January 13, 2020, Center submitted applications for the revised Project which
included the Environmental Impact Report (“EIR”), a 688 West Garvey Specific
Plan (“Specific Plan”), a zone change, Vesting Tentative Map (“VTM”), and a
Development Agreement (collectively, “Entitlements”).  The revised Project
included Plan A but also a “Plan B2.”  Plan B2 provided for slope
stabilization like Plan B but in a way that allowed for residential development
like Plan A. 
On
February 5, 2020, the City told KCM that Plan B2 had to go through the same
hearing process as any other development.  After KCM received comments, it
revised and resubmitted Plan B2 on May 8, 2020.  
On
May 13, 2020, KCM explained to the City that Center was prepared to proceed
with slope remediation but had been advised that the Project still needed City
Council approval.  In light of the Settlement Agreement’s milestones, KCM
asked if Center could commence Plan B2’s slope remediation while waiting for
City Council approval of the residential development components.  The City
never responded. 
On
May 29, 2020, Center submitted the Initial Study and a draft Notice of
Preparation (“NOP”).  After the City’s comments, Center resubmitted them
on July 2, 2020.  On July 9, 2020, Center submitted a Draft EIR
(“DEIR”).  On July 10, 2020, the City explained it would not accept a DEIR
until the NOP was published, but it did not explain why that had not
happened. 
On
July 16, 2020, the City notified KCM that it was publishing the NOP.  This
breached the Settlement Agreement, which required that the City publish the NOP
by May 29, 2020.  The City did not explain how to address its breach and
its effect on later milestones. 
On
July 22, 2020, per the California Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”), the City
circulated the NOP with the Initial Study for review and comment.  
During
a conference call on August 7, 2020, the City explained that, while it had no
additional comments on Plan B2, it could not be approved until the City Council
approved the residential component.  This breached the Settlement
Agreement which permitted this exact scenario. 
On
August 18, 2020, Center proposed a revised timeline for Project processing that
included the desired November 2020 City Council hearing date for consideration
of the whole Project.  The City Attorney said that the proposed schedule
“seems OK”. 
Between
August 24 and September 2, 2020, Center received City and public comments on
the DEIR.  After additional rounds of comments and revisions, Center
provided a revised DEIR on November 16, 2020.  On November 20, 2020, the
City raised a new issue of traffic safety concerns based upon line-of-sight
issues on the driveway to the Project.  After detailed discussions between
experts, Center submitted an updated DEIR on January 12, 2021. 
The
cycle of updated DEIRs and new comments continued until March 9, 2021, when the
City submitted the latest DEIR to the State Clearinghouse.  The Settlement
Agreement had required that the City do so by July 10, 2020.  On March 11,
2021, Center released the DEIR for public review. 
On
June 16, 2021, the City Council conducted a public hearing to certify the EIR
and approve the Project-related Entitlements.  The City Council approved
the Entitlements, finding that the Project conforms to the City’s General Plan
and zoning.  It also passed a Public Contracts Code Waiver that authorized
the City Manager to contract with a third party to stabilize the hillside
without having to bid the public project in case it had to pursue Plan
B.   
The
Development Agreement became effective on July 17, 2021, with a 20 year
duration.  The Development Agreement granted Center the right to develop
the Project in accordance with the Entitlements.  To expedite development,
City agreed to reasonably cooperate with Center to establish time frames for
processing and reviewing such ministerial permits and approvals and
discretionary actions.  It would also comply with any timeframes set in
the Entitlements.  This included a duty to promptly commence and diligently
proceed to complete required steps once Center meets the prerequisites. 
On
June 18, 2021, Center submitted the Permit application.  Approval of a
grading permit application is ministerial, but the City said that it would
engage in a stringent plan check process.  For the next few months, the
City requested changes or additional documents from Center. 
On
October 5, 2021, City staff confirmed that the City had everything it needed to
issue the Permit.  On December 17, 2021, the City Attorney informed Center
that he believed the City would not issue the Permit.  Because Center
never received a final action from the City, it had nothing from which to
appeal under Building Code section 113. 
 
d.
Litigation with Save Our Slopes 
On
July 21, 2021, petitioner Save Our Slopes challenged the Entitlements and
Public Contracts Code Waiver via petition for writ of mandate against Center
and City in Save Our Slopes v. City of Monterey Park et seq., Los Angeles
Superior Court, (“SOS”) Case No. 21STCP02365.  Center
acknowledged that SOS would delay development of the Project but
continued to apply for the necessary approvals for the slope remediation. 
On
October 13, 2021, the City informed Center that it was engaging in its own
settlement negotiations for SOS and did not want Center to
interfere.   
 
e.
The City’s Notice of Default 
On
October 13, 2021, the City issued a Notice of Default (“NOD”) for the
Settlement Agreement.  The NOD informed Center that, pursuant to the
Settlement Agreement, the City was taking over the Property and completing Plan
B.   
On
October 19, 2021, Center formally contested the NOD.  The same day, City
staff replaced the locks on the Property. 
On
November 17, 2021, the City obtained an abatement warrant (“Abatement Warrant”)
without notice to Center to begin a narrow scope of slope abatement actions,
including temporary winterization.   
On
January 15, 2022, KCM informed Center that their contract had expired and that
KCM was entering a new contract with the City. 
On
February 17, 2022, the City filed a motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement
and obtain permanent control over the Property so that it could perform
abatement measures beyond what the Abatement Warrant allowed.   
On
March 2, 2022, the California State Water Resources Control Board (“Water
Board”) issued a Receipt of Your Notice of Intent to the City’s commitment to
comply with the terms of the General Permit to Discharge Storm Water Associated
with Construction Activity required by the federal Clean Water Act and
Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act.  The City necessarily must have
filed the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (“SWPPP”) while it was reviewing
Center’s Permit application that included Center’s SWPPP. 
The
Abatement Warrant expired, and the City withdrew its motion to enforce the
Settlement Agreement.  The City now is in control of the Property without
any court authorization or permission from Center.  The City’s slope
remediation actions have not abated the issue because there are gaps and
deterioration in the sheeting covering the slope.  The City is also
pursuing a slope remediation option that will make further Property development
impossible. 
The
City is delaying the SOS case so that it can complete slope
stabilization with the Public Contracts Code Waiver and without engaging in the
public bidding process.  After stabilization, the City plans to settle the
SOS case by voiding the Entitlements. 
 
f.
Center’s Notice of Default 
On
April 4, 2022, Center served the City with a Notice of Default under the
Development Agreement for failing to issue the Permit and failing to cooperate
in defending the SOS case.   
On
May 16, 2022, the City responded to the Notice of Default, alleging that Center
had no active Permit application.  This contradicted its assurance on
October 5, 2021, that the application was complete.  The City alleged that
the Permit application expired either on December 20, 2021 or March 18,
2022.  Meanwhile, the City’s failure to take final action on the Permit
application left Center with nothing to appeal. 
The
City told Center that it needed to file a government claim under Civil Code
section 911.2.  Center filed this claim on June 8, 2022.  The City
did not respond by the July 25, 2022 deadline. 
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
May 5, 2022, Center served the City with the Petition and Summons.
            On
August 31, 2022, Center filed and served the FAP.
            On
September 15, 2022, the court stayed all non-mandamus causes of action in the
FAP, leaving only the first, six, seventh, and eighth causes of action at
issue.
            On
July 14, 2023, the City filed an Answer to the claims not stayed.  On July 27, 2023, the City amended its
Answer.
            On
September 19, 2023, the court heard the trial and stayed the mandamus causes of
action in the FAP pending the outcome of the City’s eminent domain case
(22STCV36603).  The court subsequently
determined to continue the stay on non-mandamus claims.
            On
August 13, 2024, Center’s counsel filed the instant motion to be relieved as counsel
with supporting declaration. 
 
            B. Applicable Law
            The
attorney in an action or special proceeding may be changed at any time before
or after judgment or final determination upon the order of the court, upon the
application of either client or attorney, after notice from one to the other.  CCP §284(2). 
The court’s power to permit withdrawal of an attorney rests within its
sound discretion.  Jones v. Green,
(1946) 74 Cal.App.2d 223.
            A
notice of motion and motion to be relieved as counsel under CCP §284(2) shall
be directed to the client and shall be made on the Notice of Motion and Motion
to Be Relieved as Counsel-Civil form (MC-051). 
CRC 3.1362(a).  No memorandum is
required for the motion.  CRC 3.1362(b).  The motion shall be accompanied by a
declaration stating in general terms, without compromising the confidentiality
of the attorney-client relationship, why a motion under CCP section 284(2) is
brought instead of filing a consent under CCP §284(1).  CRC 3.1362(c).  If the motion is served by mail, it shall be
accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing either (1) the service
address is the current residence of business address of the client or (2) the
service address is the last known residence or business address of the client
and the attorney has been unable to locate a more current address after making
reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days prior to filing the motion.  CRC 3.1362(d).
            The
motion may be brought on various grounds, some of which include the failure of
the client to pay attorney fees (People v. Prince, (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398, 406), the client insisting on an action that is not justified under
existing law or by good faith argument (Estate of Falco v. Decker,
(1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1015), and a conflict of interest (Aceves v.
Superior Court, (1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 584, 592).  Where an attorney’s withdrawal can be
accomplished without undue prejudice to his or her client’s interests, no
showing of “good cause” for the withdrawal is necessary.  Ramirez v. Sturdevant, (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.  
            Counsel
must also prepare a proposed order relieving counsel on the Order Granting
Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel-Civil (MC-053).  CRC 3.1362(e).  The order must specify all hearing dates
scheduled in the action or proceeding, including the date of trial, if
known.  CRC 3.1362(e).  If no hearing date is presently scheduled,
the court may set one and specify the date in the order. After the order is
signed, a copy of the signed order must be served on the client and on all
parties that have appeared in the case. 
CRC 3.1362(e).  The court may
delay the effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service
of a copy of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court.  CRC 3.1362(e).
 
            C. Analysis
Petitioner Center’s counsel submitted its motion to be
relieved as counsel, declaration in support, and order granting the motion, on
the appropriate civil forms. 
Petitioner’s counsel moves to withdraw on the grounds that there has
been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.  Center has not opposed the request to
withdraw.  
A breakdown in the
relationship has arisen between Center and Sheppard Mullin such that Sheppard
Mullin is no longer able to represent Center. 
Shepard Mullin Decl. at 1.  Center
was provided notice on June 13, 2024 that Sheppard Mullin would seek to be
removed as counsel.  Sheppard Mullin does
not believe substitute counsel has been engaged and Center has not consented to
Sheppard Mullin's withdraw from the matter.  Shepard Mullin Decl. at 1.  
As noted above, counsel’s reasons for withdrawing are
irrelevant in the absence of undue prejudice. 
The trial in this action has occurred and the court stayed the mandamus
causes of action in the FAP pending the outcome of the City’s eminent domain
case (22STCV36603).  The court
subsequently determined to continue the stay on non-mandamus claims.  
The next scheduled hearing date is January 21, 2025 for a
status conference on the stayed claims. 
Center will sufficient time to retain new counsel to represent it and will
not suffer prejudice from counsel’s withdrawal.   
Counsel’s motion to withdraw as Center’s counsel of record
is granted, effective upon filing of proof of service of the signed order on Center.
