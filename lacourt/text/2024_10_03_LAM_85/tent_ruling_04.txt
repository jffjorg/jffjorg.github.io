 Case Number:  24STCV21251    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2024    Dept:  85 
Peter Trifunovich v. Mandeep
Sidhu and Premier America Credit Union, 24STCV21251 

Tentative decision on application
for preliminary injunction:   granted in 
part




 



 
Plaintiff Peter Trifunovich (“Trifunovich”) seeks a
preliminary injunction against Defendants Mandeep Sidhu (“Sidhu”) and Premier
America Credit Union (“Credit Union”) to enjoin them from unlawfully evicting him
from, and interfering with his quiet enjoyment of, real property located at
7840 Ventura Canyon Ave., Panorama City, CA 91402 (“Property”), and from entering
the Property without providing at least 24-hours’ notice in writing. 
The court has read and considered the moving papers and opposition
(no reply filed) and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
1. Complaint 
On August 20, 2024, Plaintiff Trifunovich filed this action
against Defendants Siduh and Credit Union, alleging claims for quiet title, breach
of fiduciary duty, and declaratory relief.  The verified Complaint alleges in pertinent
part as follows.
Trifunovich and Sidhu purchased the Property together in
2011.  Compl., ¶10.  Trifunovich and Sidhu agreed that only Sidhu's name
would be on the title and Sidhu would take out the mortgage.  Compl., ¶11.   The parties also agreed that Trifunovich would
make the initial down payment and subsequent mortgage payments as well as
occupy and own the Property in fee simple. 
Compl., ¶11.  
Sidhu obtained
financing to purchase the Property.  Compl., ¶12.  Trifunovich is informed and
believes that Credit Union is currently the primary lender for the Property and
holds a Deed of Trust (“DOT”) on the Property. 
Compl., ¶13.  
Trifunovich provided the funds for the down payment in 2011.  Compl., ¶14.  Since 2011, Trifunovich
has made every mortgage payment until he was prevented from doing so by Credit
Union.  Compl., ¶14.  Since 2011, Trifunovich
has paid the property taxes.  Compl., ¶14.  In
or around 2022, Trifunovich became ill and fell behind on the tax
payments.  Compl., ¶16.  Trifunovich
currently occupies the Property and has done so since 2011.  Compl., ¶15.  
On or about August
7, 2024, Trifunovich went to Credit Union to make his mortgage payment and was
told that Credit Union would not accept his payment or have any conversation
with him about the Property, mortgage, or mortgage payments.  Compl., ¶17.  On or about August 14, 2024,
Sidhu informed Trifunovich that she had made an “executive decision” regarding
the Property and he had to vacate the Property by August 21, 2024.  Compl., ¶18.  
Following this
conversation, Trifunovich is informed and believes that Sidhu sold or
transferred the Property.  Compl.,
¶19. 
Trifunovich seeks to quiet title against claims to the Property by
Defendants Sidhu, Credit Union, and any other relevant Doe Defendants.  Compl., ¶20.  
 
2. Course of Proceedings
On August 20, 2024, Trifunovich filed the Complaint. 
On September 9, 2024, Trifunovich filed an ex parte application
for a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) and an order to show cause (“OSC”) restraining
Sidhu from (1) engaging in self-help to unlawfully evict Trifunovich or
interfering with  his quiet enjoyment of
the Property, (2) ntering the Property without 24-hour notice, and (3) transferring
title to or selling the Property.  
The court granted the TRO/OSC in part on September 11, 2024.  The TRO/OSC restrained Sidhu from engaging in
self-help to unlawfully evict Trifunovich or interfering with his quiet
enjoyment of the Property and entering the Property without 24-hour notice.  The TRO/OSC did not prevent Sidhu from transferring
title to or selling the Property.
On September 17, 2024, Trifunovich dismissed his claims
against Credit Union.
 
B. Applicable Law
An injunction is a writ or order requiring a person to
refrain from a particular act; it may be granted by the court in which the
action is brought, or by a judge thereof; and when granted by a judge, it may
be enforced as an order of the court. 
CCP §525.  An injunction may be
more completely defined as a writ or order commanding a person either to
perform or to refrain from performing a particular act.  See Comfort v. Comfort, (1941)
17 Cal.2d 736, 741. McDowell v. Watson, (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1155, 1160.[1]  It is an equitable remedy available generally
in the protection or to prevent the invasion of a legal right.  Meridian, Ltd. v. City and County of San
Francisco, et al., (1939) 13 Cal.2d 424.
The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status
quo pending final resolution upon a trial. 
See Scaringe v. J.C.C. Enterprises, Inc., (1988) 205
Cal.App.3d 1536. Grothe v. Cortlandt Corp., (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1313,
1316; Major v. Miraverde Homeowners Assn., (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 618,
623.  The status quo has been
defined to mean the last actual peaceable, uncontested status which preceded
the pending controversy.  Voorhies v.
Greene (1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 989, 995, quoting United Railroads v.
Superior Court, (1916) 172 Cal. 80, 87. 14859 Moorpark
Homeowner’s Assn. v. VRT Corp., (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402.
A preliminary injunction is issued after hearing on a
noticed motion.  The complaint normally
must plead injunctive relief.  CCP
§526(a)(1)-(2).[2]  Preliminary injunctive relief requires the
use of competent evidence to create a sufficient factual showing on the grounds
for relief.  See e.g. Ancora-Citronelle
Corp. v. Green, (1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 146, 150.  Injunctive relief may be granted based on a
verified complaint only if it contains sufficient evidentiary, not ultimate,
facts.  See CCP §527(a).  For this reason, a pleading alone rarely
suffices.  Weil & Brown, California
Procedure Before Trial, 9:579, 9(ll)-21 (The Rutter Group 2007).  The burden of proof is on the plaintiff as
moving party.  O’Connell v. Superior
Court, (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1452, 1481. 
A plaintiff seeking injunctive relief must show the absence
of an adequate damages remedy at law. 
CCP §526(4); Thayer Plymouth Center, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors,
(1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 300, 307; Department of Fish & Game v. Anderson-Cottonwood
Irrigation Dist., (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1554, 1565.  The concept of “inadequacy of the legal
remedy” or “inadequacy of damages” dates from the time of the early courts of
chancery, the idea being that an injunction is an unusual or extraordinary
equitable remedy which will not be granted if the remedy at law (usually
damages) will adequately compensate the injured plaintiff.  Department of Fish & Game v.
Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation Dist., (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1554, 1565.
In determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction,
the trial court considers two factors: (1) the reasonable probability that the
plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial (CCP §526(a)(1)), and (2) a
balancing of the “irreparable harm” that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if
the injunction is denied as compared to the harm that the defendant is likely
to suffer if the court grants a preliminary injunction.  CCP §526(a)(2); 14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s
Assn. v. VRT Corp., (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402; Pillsbury, Madison
& Sutro v. Schectman, (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1283; Davenport v.
Blue Cross of California, (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 435, 446; Abrams v. St.
Johns Hospital, (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 628, 636.  Thus, a preliminary injunction may not issue
without some showing of potential entitlement to such relief.  Doe v. Wilson, (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th
296, 304.  The decision to grant a
preliminary injunction generally lies within the sound discretion of the trial
court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.  Thornton v. Carlson, (1992) 4
Cal.App.4th 1249, 1255.
A preliminary injunction ordinarily cannot take effect
unless and until the plaintiff provides an undertaking for damages which the
enjoined defendant may sustain by reason of the injunction if the court finally
decides that the plaintiff was not entitled to the injunction.  See CCP §529(a); City of South San
Francisco v. Cypress Lawn Cemetery Assn., (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 916, 920.
 
C. Statement of Facts
1. Trifunovich’s
Evidence
Trifunovich has
continuously occupied the Property for 28 years.  Trifunovich Decl., ¶2.  It has been his residence, rental property,
and place to keep and work on his extensive classic car collection.  Trifunovich Decl., ¶2.  Trifunovich’s entire life revolves around his
car collection which is centered at the Property.  Trifunovich Decl., ¶2.  
Trifunovich is at
the Property every day where he manages his car collection, where he tends to
his other collections, as well as feeds his cats and waters the plants and
trees.  Trifunovich Decl., ¶2.  Prior to the events of August 18, 2024, Sidhu
had been to the Property once in the past 13 years.  Trifunovich Decl., ¶2.  
In or around 2011,
Trifunovich owned several properties.  Trifunovich
Decl., ¶16.  At that time, Sidhu
approached Trifunovich to see if he would allow her to put her name on one of
his properties so that she could get a tax break.  Trifunovich Decl., ¶16.  They agreed that they would put her name on
the title for the Property.  Trifunovich
Decl., ¶16.  Accordingly, they put her
name on the title and the mortgage paperwork. 
Trifunovich Decl., ¶16.  They
agreed that Trifunovich would make the initial down payment and subsequent
mortgage payments and that Trifunovich would occupy and own the Property.  Trifunovich Decl., ¶16.  However, Sidhu’s name would be on the
Property and the Mortgage.  Trifunovich
Decl., ¶16.  
That being said, Sidhu
would never be responsible to pay for anything related to the Property.  Trifunovich Decl., ¶16.  It was clearly understood that Sidhu’s name
would only be on the title and that she would hold title in trust for
Trifunovich.  Trifunovich Decl., ¶16.  Trifunovich provided approximately $58,000
for the down payment in 2011 and has made every mortgage payment (most recently
in the amount of $2,100 per month) through August 2024, when Credit Union
refused to accept his payment.  Trifunovich
Decl., ¶16.  
The Credit Union
employees know Trifunovich well as he has regularly made payments at the branch
since the Property was refinanced in 2017. 
Trifunovich Decl., ¶17.  Additionally, the agreement between Sidhu and
Trifunovich was reaffirmed in 2017 when the Property was refinanced.  Trifunovich Decl., ¶17.  The mortgage brokers that worked with them in
2011 and 2017 were aware of the agreement between Sidhu and Trifunovich.  Trifunovich Decl., ¶1.  
By August of 2024,
Sidhu had been frustrated that Trifunovich was in arrears in paying the
property taxes on the Property.  Trifunovich
Decl., ¶18.  Without any clear warning,
Sidhu told Trifunovich that she decided to surrender the deed to the Property
to the bank.  Trifunovich Decl., ¶18.  Trifunovich now believes that to be untrue
and that Sidhu partnered with others -- Kevin Eugene Burth (“Burth”), and
George Harris (“Harris”) -- to evict Trifunovich and sell the Property, thereby
destroying Trifunovich’s livelihood, and stealing approximately $300,000 of
Trifunovich’s equity in the Property.  Trifunovich
Decl., ¶18.  
Beginning mid-August
2024, Sidhu, Burth, and Harris began a campaign of intimidation and harassment
to steal and forcibly evict Trifunovich from the Property.  Trifunovich Decl., ¶4.  On numerous occasions, Sidhu, Burth, and
Harris have broken into the Property, broken doors and windows, changed locks,
installed surveillance cameras, changed the utilities, yelled at Trifunovich,
and threatened to have him arrested by falsely alleging that he is a trespasser
on his own Property.  Trifunovich Decl.,
¶4.  Photographs depict damage, vandalism
and harassment by Defendants.  Trifunovich
Decl., ¶¶ 7-15, Exs. B-J.  
On September 4,
2024, during an incident at the Property where Sidhu tried to have Trifunovich
arrested, Sidhu told one of the responding LAPD officers that Trifunovich must
be out of the Property by September 9, 2024, due to the Property’s escrow.
Trifunovich Decl., ¶5.  The LAPD officers
informed Trifunovich that Defendants claim that he is a trespasser and that he
is not a resident of the Property. Trifunovich Decl., ¶¶ 5, 14-15.  The first time the officers arrived they
detained Trifunovich and placed him in handcuffs as a trespasser.  Trifunovich Decl. ¶5.  After Trifunovich’s explanation the situation
to the officers, they released him and told me that he was a resident and that
he should seek a restraining order.  Trifunovich
Decl. ¶5.  The officers also told
Trifunovich that they told Defendants they should deal with the matter in court.
 Trifunovich Decl., ¶5.  Further, the officers told Trifunovich that
they are unable to do anything about Defendants forcing their way on to his
Property, breaking doors, windows, locks and vandalizing the Property.  Trifunovich Decl., ¶5.  
On September 3,
2024, at 3:14 p.m., Burth, who works for or with Sidhu, threatened counsel for
Trifunovich with violence in attempt to intimidate him into not going forward
with this lawsuit against Sidhu. Trifunovich’s counsel believed Burth’s threats
to be credible.  Singleton Decl., ¶5.
Trifunovich is 65
years old and because of Defendants campaign of harassment against him, is
scared that Defendants will physically harm him and/or force him from the
Property.  Trifunovich Decl., ¶17.  If Trifunovich is forced from his Property of
28 years he will lose his ability to manage his car collection at the Property,
which is his primary asset, and his life’s work.  Trifunovich Decl., ¶17.  
 
2. Defendants’
Evidence
Trifunovich acquired
the Property on August 1, 2005, from Alexander Tombros.  Sidhu Decl., ¶1, Ex. 1.  At the time Sidhu acquired the Property from
Trifunovich, he was experiencing financial difficulties.  Sidhu Decl., ¶1.  Sidhu purchased the Property pursuant to a
short sale agreement.  Sidhu Decl., ¶1,
Ex. 1.  Since acquiring the Property on
July 15, 2011, Sidhu has been the sole holder of the title to the Property.  Sidhu Decl., ¶1.  
A DOT in connection
with Sidhu’s acquisition of the Property was recorded on July 15, 2011.  Sidhu Decl., ¶2, Ex. 3.  Sidhu refinanced the Property and a Full
Reconveyance was recorded on November 2, 2012. 
Sidhu Decl., ¶2, Ex. 4.  
On September 19,
2023, a Notice of Power to Sell Tax-Defaulted Property was recorded.  Sidhu Decl., ¶2.  
In July 2024, Sidhu
had not been in contact with Trifunovich for several months.  Sidhu Decl., ¶4.  Sidhu was finally able to contact him and
alert Trifunovich to the fact that Sidhu could no longer hold onto the
Property.  Sidhu Decl., ¶4.  Sidhu was unable to keep up with the property
taxes and her dreams of opening a facility had evaporated.  Sidhu Decl., ¶4.  Sidhu explained to Trifunovich that unless she
was able to sell the Property, it would likely be foreclosed upon by the
lender.  Sidhu Decl., ¶4.  Sidhu provided Trifunovich with ample notice
to remove his personal belongings from the Property.  Sidhu Decl., ¶4.  As a result, Trifunovich began to remove his
cars from the Property.  Sidhu Decl., ¶4.  
Since Sidhu needed
to sell the Property, he explained to Trifunovich that he should refrain from
continuing to make the mortgage payments. 
Sidhu Decl., ¶4.  Because
Trifunovich is now claiming an ownership interest in the Property, Trifunovich
contacted Joseph W. Singleton (“Singleton”), a friend of Trifunovich, who filed
the Complaint.  Sidhu Decl., ¶4.  
Sidhu is currently
in escrow to sell the Property.  Sidhu
Decl., ¶5.  The sale cannot be completed
because Trifunovich has recorded a lis pendens. 
Sidhu Decl., ¶5.  It is Sidhu’s
counsel’s intention to file a motion to expunge the lis pendens.  Sidhu Decl., ¶5. 
 
Response to
Trifunovich’s Declaration 
Sidhus responds to 
Trifunovich’s declaration as follows: 
Trifunovich has not resided at the Property for 28 years.
The Property is not his residence. Trifunovich resides at a property located in
Woodland Hills: 20743 Exhibit Place, Woodland Hills, California 91367. The
Property was never leased by its owner, Sidhu, to Trifunovich or anyone else.
There are no pets that live at the Property including living cats.  Trifunovich has never watered or otherwise
cared for plants and trees located at the Property.  Sidhu Decl., ¶3a.
Burth is a mortgage broker who was retained by a possible
buyer of the Property.  Burth has been
performing underwriting work in the normal course of his business.  Sidhu has no idea who Harris is.  In any event, Sidhu had nothing to do with any
actions that may have been taken by Burth or Harris.  Sidhu Decl., ¶3b.
Sidhu is not trying to steal her own Property. She is the
title owner and Trifunovich has no legal right to the Property. Trifunovich is
not a lawful tenant at the Property.  Sidhu Decl., ¶3c.
Other than changing the utilities, none of Trifunovich’s other
representations are true. There is no reason why Sidhu would ever damage her own
Property.  Sidhu Decl., ¶3d. 
Sidhu notified Trifunovich that he had to leave the Property
by August 21, 2024 because the Property is in escrow and Sidhu is required to
deliver the Property vacant.  She called
the LAPD when she observed several people on the Property and was afraid to
enter out of concern for her personal safety. LAPD officers arrived and spoke
separately with Trifunovich.  Sidhu’s goal
was to have the occupants removed from the Property and not have anyone
arrested. Trifunovich was not arrested because he presented the LAPD officers
with a fabricated lease agreement with someone named Angelica Miller pretending
to be a lawful tenant. Sidhu was sent inappropriate messages by Trifunovich,
including that he wanted to kill himself.  In no way did she ever do or say anything
remotely aggressive. Any possible threat of violence, whether to oneself or
others, solely came from Trifunovich. This is another reason Sidhu erred on the
side of asking LAPD officers to come to the Property to have the occupants
leave.  Sidhu Decl., ¶3e.
The only other time that the LAPD was called to the Property
by Sidhu occurred when she observed an unidentified vehicle parked in the
driveway and she requested that it be towed.  Sidhu Decl., ¶3f.
Trifunovich acquired the Property in 2005, which is 19 years
ago. If he was a tenant of the prior owner, it is possible that he has been
there for 28 years.  Sidhu has never
engaged in a campaign to harass Trifunovich.  Sidhu Decl., ¶3g.
Sidhu was introduced to Trifunovich when the Property was
being foreclosed. Sidhu had the opportunity to purchase the Property at a short
sale as an investment opportunity.  The plan
was to acquire the Property and develop it into an assisted living facility or
rehabilitation facility. Sidhu acquired the Property to develop it and not to
obtain tax deductions.  Sidhu Decl., ¶3h.
There was no agreement that Sidhu would be solely on title.
There was no agreement regarding the down payment and mortgage payments.  Sidhu never agreed to allow Trifunovich to
“own” and “occupy” the Property. After Sidhu purchased the Property from
Trifunovich, she attempted to convince him to vacate it.  He was unwilling to do so.  Instead of pursuing an unlawful detainer
action at that time, Sidhu allowed Trifunovich to make the mortgage payments in
exchange for his items of personal property remaining at the Property until she
was in a position to develop it.  Sidhu
Decl., ¶3i.
 When Sidhu purchased
the Property from Trifunovich, she borrowed money from both an institutional
lender and an additional amount from Trifunovich’s mother. This was
Trifunovich’s idea since Sidhu needed a loan to help cover some of the down
payment. This was purely a professional, arms-length agreement. The $58,000
referenced by Trifunovich is the approximate amount that Sidhu borrowed from
his mother.  Sidhu eventually repaid the
loan to Trifunovich’s mother when she refinanced the Property in 2012.  If Trifunovich actually had $58,000 available
to him, why would he have allowed the Property to go into foreclosure?  Sidhu Decl., ¶3j.
Sidhu acknowledges that she was in arrears in payment of
property taxes.  This is the reason why she
decided to sell the Property. Sidhu Decl., ¶3k.
 
Irreparable Harm
Trifunovich’s
attempts to frustrate the sale have caused Sidhu to incur substantial debt
which would cause him to suffer financial ruin. 
Sidhu Decl., ¶5.  Sidhu has
incurred and will continue to incur the following expenses if a preliminary
injunction prevented the sale:
(1) Property Tax
payments – The Property is currently in arrears in the amount of $49,360.00.
The amount of each payment for every six months is $2,199.05. If this case were
to linger for a period of 1 ½ years, the total additional arrears would amount
to $6,597.15 for a total of $55,957.15.  Sidhu Decl., ¶5a.  
(2) Monthly Mortgage
payments - Sidhu cannot afford to make the monthly mortgage payments of
$2,167.00. If this case were to pend for another 1 ½ years, he would have to
try to scrap together a total of $39,006. He has doubts as to whether he would
be able to make these payments. If Sidhu were unable to keep the mortgage
payments current, the lender would likely foreclose on the Property.  Sidhu Decl., ¶5b.  
(3) Present Status
of the Property - The Property is currently in escrow for a sale price of $594,000.
 Sidhu anticipates that the sales
expenses including brokers’ fees will be approximately 7% of the sale price.
The balance on the mortgage is $286,525.62. The net to him after the property
taxes and mortgage are paid would be $216,534.40. He has been informed that if he
is unable to sell the Property at the present time, the buyer will cancel the
transaction.  Sidhu Decl., ¶5c.  
(4) Litigation
expenses – Sidhu has been advised that it will cost him at least $125,000 for
attorney fees and costs should this matter be tried.  Sidhu Decl., ¶5. 
 
3. Reply Evidence
Trifunovich’s
nephew, Josh Trifunovich (“Josh”), was the mortgage broker for both the
original loan and the subsequent refinancing of the Property.  Josh Reply Decl., ¶¶ 2- 5.  Josh put together all of the paperwork for the
short sale mortgage in 2011 and the refinancing in 2017. Josh Reply Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.
 
In 2011 and 2017,
Josh interacted with both Trifunovich and Sidhu where the straw purchaser
nature of the Property was discussed.  Josh Reply Decl., ¶6.  “It was discussed during the meetings that [Sidhu]
had good credit and would be able to get a better loan than [Trifunovich] and
that she would be the straw purchaser in the short sale.  [Trifuovich] would provide the down payment
and pay the mortgage on the Property.”  Josh
Reply Decl., ¶7.  It was clear to Josh
that Trifunovich would be, and was, the actual owner of the Property with Sidhu
holding title for him.  Josh Reply Decl.,
¶ 8.
Sidhu never paid
anything for the Property until she affirmatively prevented Trifunovich from
paying the mortgage as had been doing for the past 13 years.  Reply Trifunovich Decl., ¶27. 
Credit Union has
stated that there is no current threat of any foreclosure.  Singleton Reply Decl. ¶5, Ex. M.  Trifunovich, if given credit for the tax
payment, can pay the entire tax arrearage by October 16, 2024.  Trifunovich Reply Decl. ¶¶ 30-31.  
 
D. Analysis
Plaintiff Trifunovich seeks a preliminary injunction against
Defendant Sidhu (Credit Union has been dismissed) enjoining from (1) unlawfully
evicting him from, and interfering with his quiet enjoyment of, the Property,
and (2) entering the Property without providing at least 24-hours’ notice in
writing. 
 
1. The Preliminary Injunction
The parties misunderstand the scope of the OSC by presenting
considerable evidence on who owns the Property. 
Sidhu is the legal owner – which has real meaning.  However, Trifunovich presents evidence that
he is the beneficial owner.  Both sides
have arguments supporting their positions. 
Both sides also suffer from problems in their presentation as the other
party points out.  There also is little
supporting documentary evidence, including mortgage payments, property tax
payments, and tax return deductions. 
The court need not decide who has a probability of success
on the ownership issue because it is outside the scope of the OSC.  The TRO/OSC was granted in part on September
11, 2024, restraining Sidhu from engaging in self-help to unlawfully evict
Trifunovich or interfering with his quiet enjoyment of the Property and from entering
the Property without 24-hour notice.  The
TRO/OSC did not, however, prevent Sidhu from transferring title to or selling
the Property.  Since Sidhu is not
restrained by the TRO from selling the Property, and only is restrained from
doing so by the lis pendens, the court need not decide which party probably
owns the Property. 
Sidhu does not oppose a preliminary injunction restraining
her from engaging in self-help to unlawfully evict Trifunovich or interfering
with his quiet enjoyment of the Property and entering the Property without
24-hour notice.  Opp. at 4.  She only argues that she cannot be restrained
from lawfully evicting Trifunovich through an unlawful detainer proceeding, which
is outside the scope of the OSC.  Opp. at
5.  The court agrees that lawful eviction
is not within the OSC scope.
 
2. The Bond
A preliminary injunction requires a bond.  The purpose of a bond is to cover the
defendant’s damages from an improvidently issued injunction.  CCP §529(a). 
In setting the bond, the court must assume that the preliminary injunction
was wrongly issued.  Abba Rubber Co.
v. Seaquist, (“Abba”) (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1, 15.  The attorney’s fees necessary to successfully
procure a final decision dissolving the injunction also are damages that should
be included in setting the bond.  Id.
at 15-16.  While Abba reasoned
that the plaintiff’s likelihood of prevailing is irrelevant to setting the
bond, a more recent case disagreed, stating that the greater the likelihood of
the plaintiff prevailing, the less likely the preliminary injunction will have
been wrongly issued, and that is a relevant factor for setting the bond.  Oiye v. Fox, (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th
1036, 1062.  As the scope of the
preliminary injunction is unopposed, Trifunovich shall be required to post a
modest bond of $500. 
 
E. Conclusion
The application is granted in part.  A preliminary injunction shall issue
restraining Sidhu from engaging in self-help to unlawfully evict Trifunovich or
interfering with his quiet enjoyment of the Property and entering the Property
without 24-hour notice.  Trifunovich must
post a $500 bond within five court days and provide evidence of posting to
opposing counsel.
