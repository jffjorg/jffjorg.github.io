 Case Number:  22LBCV00929    Hearing Date:   October 10, 2023    Dept:  S27  
1.     Background
Facts
Plaintiff, E.L. filed this action
against Defendant, Doe #1, a California corporation, Doe #2, an individual, and
Does 3-60 on 12/07/22.  The complaint
includes causes of action for childhood sexual abuse (Doe 2), IIED (Doe 2), negligent
hiring, supervision, and retention of unfit employee (Doe 1), and negligent
supervision of a minor (Doe 1).  
 
On 12/12/22, Plaintiff filed an
attorney certificate of merit re: Doe 2 and also one re: Doe 1; the certificates
are filed under seal and are marked “received 12/09/22.”  
 
On 12/12/22, Plaintiff filed a
mental health care practitioner certificate of merit.  The certificate appears to apply to both Doe
1 and also Doe 2; it does not specifically mention either Doe, but concludes
that Plaintiff was a victim of childhood sexual abuse.  The certificate is also marked “received
12/09/22,” and is also filed under seal.
 
On 2/06/23, Plaintiff filed an ex
parte application to serve Does 1 and 2. 
On 2/06/23 and 2/07/23, Plaintiff filed additional certificates of
merit, under seal, for Does 1 and 2.  On
2/15/23, the Court granted the ex parte application to serve the doe
defendants.  
 
On 3/21/23, Plaintiff filed proof
of service on Doe 1, which was named as Community Grace Brethren Church.  On 5/16/23, LAUSD responded to the complaint
by way of demurrer, which is scheduled for hearing today.    
 
2.     Demurrer
a.     Request
for Judicial Notice
Defendant seeks judicial notice of
various documents in the court file.  The
Court grants the RJN and has considered its entire file in ruling on the demurrer.  
 
b.     Evidentiary
Objections
Plaintiff’s attorney filed a declaration
with the opposition to the demurrer.  Defendant
objects to consideration of the declaration, contending it is outside the four corners
of the complaint.  Defendant cites Allred
v. Bekins Wide World Van Services, (1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 984, 993 to support its
position that the Court cannot consider the declaration in ruling on the
demurrer.  The portion of the holding
cited, however, confirms that the Court can consider the declaration in determining
whether to grant leave to amend or not.  Ultimately,
the Court finds the attorney declaration is not necessary to rule on the motion,
and therefore declines to rule on the objections.  
 
c.     Legal
Standard on Demurrer
A demurrer is a pleading used to test
the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact,
regarding the form or content of the opposing party’s pleading.  It is not the function of the demurrer to
challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purpose of the ruling on
the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true,
however improbable they may be.
 
A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. Blank v. Kirwan 39
Cal.3d 311 (1985). No other extrinsic evidence can be considered (i.e., no
“speaking demurrers”). A demurrer is brought under CCP § 430.10 [grounds], §
430.30 [as to any matter on its face or from which judicial notice may be
taken], and § 430.50(a) [can be taken to the entire complaint or any cause of
action within].  Specifically, a demurrer
may be brought per CCP § 430.10(e) if insufficient facts are stated to support
the cause of action asserted.  Per CCP
§430.10(a) a demurrer may be brought where the court has no jurisdiction of the
subject of the cause of action alleged in the pleading.  Furthermore, demurrer for uncertainty will be
sustained only where the complaint is so bad that the defendant cannot reasonably
respond.  CCP § 430.10(f).  
 
However, in construing the
allegations, the court is to give effect to specific factual allegations that
may modify or limit inconsistent general or conclusory allegations. Financial
Corporation of America v. Wilburn, 189 Cal.App.3rd 764, 769 (1987). And, if the
facts pled in the complaint are inconsistent with facts which are incorporated
by reference from exhibits attached to the complaint, the facts in the
incorporated exhibits control. Further, irrespective of the name or label given
to a cause of action by the plaintiff, a general demurrer must be overruled if
the facts as pled in the body of the complaint state some valid claim for relief.
Special demurrers are not allowed in limited jurisdiction courts. (CCP § 92(c).)
 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. Goodman v.
Kennedy, 18 Cal.3d 335, 348 (1976). The burden is on the complainant to show
the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.) 
 
Finally, CCP section 430.41
requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party
who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining
whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer.” (CCP §430.41(a).) The parties are to meet and confer
at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (CCP §430.41(a)(2).)
Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a declaration detailing
their meet and confer efforts. (CCP §430.41(a)(3).)
 
d.     Meet
and Confer
Defense Counsel filed a declaration
adequately showing that the parties met and conferred prior to the filing of
the demurrer.  
 
e.     Certificate
of Merit
The parties agree that the statute
of limitations ran on 12/31/22, such that Plaintiff was required to file
certificates of merit prior to that time. 
Defendant contends judicially noticeable documents show Plaintiff failed
to do so.  Plaintiff contends she did
so.  
 
The Court is unsure why Defendant
is unable to see the documents in eCourt detailed above.  The Court’s docket clearly shows the required
certificates of merit were “received” on 12/09/22 and “filed” on 12/12/22, both
of which were before 12/31/22.  This
comports with Plaintiff’s attorney’s declaration concerning what happened, but
again, the Court need not consider the extrinsic evidence in the declaration
because the Court’s own docket shows the COMs were timely received and
filed.  The demurrer is therefore overruled.  
 
3.     Case
Management Conference 
The parties are reminded that there
is a CMC on calendar today concurrently with the hearing on the above demurrer.  The Court asks Counsel to make arrangements
to appear remotely at the CMC and hearing on the demurrer.
