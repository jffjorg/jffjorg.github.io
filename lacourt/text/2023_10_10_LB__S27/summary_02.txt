And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the attorneys for both parties in a lemon law case must meet and confer in good faith to resolve their discovery disputes, rather than constantly filing motions and incurring attorneys' fees. The judge has also ordered that if the parties are unable to resolve their issues, they must file a joint statement listing each disputed discovery item and explaining why a further response should or should not be ordered. The judge expects counsel to use the court's prior rulings as a guide in their meet and confer discussions, and has continued the hearing on the motion to November 21, 2023. If the parties are unable to resolve their issues, they must also file briefs and declarations detailing their efforts to meet and confer and making any arguments against the imposition of sanctions.
