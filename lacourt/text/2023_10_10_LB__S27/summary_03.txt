Summary: This is a tentative ruling by a Judge regarding a demurrer filed by the Defendant to the Plaintiff's complaint. The Plaintiff, E.L., alleges childhood sexual abuse, IIED, negligent hiring and retention, and negligent supervision against the Defendant, Doe #1 and Doe #2. The Defendant argues that the complaint is insufficient and suggests that the Plaintiff failed to file certificates of merit before the statute of limitations. The Court grants the request for judicial notice of various documents in the court file and declines to rule on the objections to the attorney declaration. The Court finds that the certificates of merit were timely filed and overrules the demurrer. The parties are reminded of a Case Management Conference scheduled for today.
