And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel a psychological examination of the plaintiff, Ariel Knight. The defendants have shown good cause for the examination, as the plaintiff has claimed ongoing mental or physical injury resulting from their acts. The examination will be limited to the specific condition in controversy, which is the plaintiff's alleged PTSD and anxiety. The defendants did not list the diagnostic tests or procedures to be conducted in their notice of motion, but they did propound a demand for psychological examination that included a list of potential tests and procedures. The judge incorporates the list of diagnostic tests and procedures from the demand into this order by reference. The examination will not occur on October 9, 2023, as the defendants had originally requested, but instead will be scheduled at a mutually agreeable date, time, and location to be determined by counsel through meet and confer communications. If the plaintiff does not meaningfully participate in these communications, the defendants may unilaterally schedule the examination with three days' notice.
