 Case Number:  23LBCV00249    Hearing Date:   October 10, 2023    Dept:  S27 1.     Background
Facts
Plaintiff, Cataline Maese filed
this action against Defendants, Marine View Apartments, LLC and Greystar Management
for breach of the warranty of habitability, breach of the covenant of quiet
enjoyment, nuisance, negligence, and breach of contract.  The crux of the complaint is that Plaintiff’s
unit has inadequate heating, unapproved and illegal construction, rubbish,
electrical wiring not up to code, filth, intentional interference with estate,
lack of hot water, leaking plumbing, and general non-maintenance.  
 
2.     Demurrer
a.     Legal
Standard on Demurrer
A demurrer is a pleading used to test
the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact,
regarding the form or content of the opposing party’s pleading.  It is not the function of the demurrer to
challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purpose of the ruling on
the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true,
however improbable they may be.
 
A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. Blank v. Kirwan 39
Cal.3d 311 (1985). No other extrinsic evidence can be considered (i.e., no
“speaking demurrers”). A demurrer is brought under CCP § 430.10 [grounds], §
430.30 [as to any matter on its face or from which judicial notice may be
taken], and § 430.50(a) [can be taken to the entire complaint or any cause of
action within].  Specifically, a demurrer
may be brought per CCP § 430.10(e) if insufficient facts are stated to support
the cause of action asserted.  Per CCP
§430.10(a) a demurrer may be brought where the court has no jurisdiction of the
subject of the cause of action alleged in the pleading.  Furthermore, demurrer for uncertainty will be
sustained only where the complaint is so bad that the defendant cannot reasonably
respond.  CCP § 430.10(f).  
 
However, in construing the
allegations, the court is to give effect to specific factual allegations that
may modify or limit inconsistent general or conclusory allegations. Financial
Corporation of America v. Wilburn, 189 Cal.App.3rd 764, 769 (1987). And, if the
facts pled in the complaint are inconsistent with facts which are incorporated
by reference from exhibits attached to the complaint, the facts in the
incorporated exhibits control. Further, irrespective of the name or label given
to a cause of action by the plaintiff, a general demurrer must be overruled if
the facts as pled in the body of the complaint state some valid claim for relief.
Special demurrers are not allowed in limited jurisdiction courts. (CCP § 92(c).)
 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. Goodman v.
Kennedy, 18 Cal.3d 335, 348 (1976). The burden is on the complainant to show
the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.) 
 
Finally, CCP section 430.41
requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party
who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining
whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer.” (CCP §430.41(a).) The parties are to meet and confer
at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (CCP §430.41(a)(2).)
Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a declaration detailing
their meet and confer efforts. (CCP §430.41(a)(3).)
 
b.     Meet
and Confer
Counsel for the demurring defendant
filed a meet and confer declaration, stating that the parties attempted to meet
and confer but were unable to resolve the issues presented by way of the demurrer
(and motion to strike).  
 
c.     Second
Cause of Action, Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment 
i.             
Actual or Constructive Eviction
Defendant argues the problems with the
property must rise to the level of actual or constructive eviction to constitute
a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, citing Clark v. Spiegel (1971) 22
Cal.Apap.3d 74, 80.  Plaintiff argues
this is a mis-statement of the law.  The Court
has reviewed the Landlord-Tenant Rutter Guide, and finds it explains the following
in this regard:
A breach of the covenant of quiet
enjoyment “can take many forms, including actual or constructive eviction.”
[See  Nativi v. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust
Co. (2014) 223 CA4th 261, 293, 167 CR3d 173, 200 (collecting cases);  Spinks v. Equity Residential Briarwood Apts.
(2009) 171 CA4th 1004, 1036, 90 CR3d 453, 479 (collecting cases)—landlords'
removing furniture from apartment and changing locks “could support judgment”
on breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment claim; 
Ginsberg v. Gamson (2012) 205 CA4th 873, 897, 141 CR3d 62, 81]
• [4:11] Interference with a
tenant's water supply is an actionable breach of the covenant. [Marchese v.
Standard Realty & Develop. Co. (1977) 74 CA3d 142, 146, 141 CR 370, 372]
• [4:11.1] Termination or reduction
in services due under the lease breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment. [Public
Employees' Retirement System v. Winston (1989) 209 CA3d 205, 208, 258 CR 612,
613]
• [4:12] Likewise, there may be a
breach where the landlord acts to terminate the lease in “bad faith.”
…
• [4:14] Similarly, a landlord
breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment when construction work on the story
above tenant's unit exposed the unit to adverse weather conditions for 1 1/2
years, causing flooding from rainstorms and ultimately rendering the unit
uninhabitable. [ Barkett v. Brucato (1953) 122 CA2d 264, 274-275, 264 P2d 978,
986-987]
• [4:15] Violating a restrictive
covenant in the lease not to rent to a competing business in the same building
breaches the warranty of quiet enjoyment … because it interferes with the
tenant's beneficial use of the property as contemplated by the lease. [
Kulawitz v. Pacific Woodenware & Paper Co. (1944) 25 C2d 664, 669-670, 155
P2d 24, 27]
 
Notably, however, actually vacating
the property is not required.  The guide
goes on to explain the following:
Historically, there could be no
actionable breach of the covenant (either through an affirmative damages action
or as a defense or offset to an unlawful detainer for nonpayment of rent)
unless the tenant vacated the unit: i.e., there either had to be an actual
eviction, or conduct so serious on the part of the landlord as to cause the
tenant to vacate (a “constructive eviction”). [ Kulawitz v. Pacific Woodenware
& Paper Co. (1944) 25 C2d 664, 670, 155 P2d 24, 27;  Petroleum Collections Inc. v. Swords, supra,
48 CA3d at 847-848, 122 CR at 117;  Clark
v. Spiegel (1971) 22 CA3d 74, 79-80, 99 CR 86, 89; and see  Green v. Sup.Ct. (Sumski) (1974) 10 C3d 616,
625, 111 CR 704, 710, fn. 10 (dicta)]
However, this restrictive view is
now out of sync with both the common law development of tenant rights and
remedies (¶ 4:21.1 ff.) and a tenant's statutory civil penalty cause of action
for landlord intimidation interfering with the tenant's right to quiet
enjoyment (¶ 4:24.5).
(1) [4:21.1] Case law development
against conditioning actionable breach on tenant “ouster”: Case law development
takes a more liberal approach to the issue, holding that a tenant can recover
damages for a breach of the covenant although still in possession of the
premises. These cases recognize that tenants may lose the benefits of their
rental agreements by landlord conduct amounting to something less than complete
ouster—i.e., “some act of molestation, affecting, to [tenant's] prejudice, the
possession of the [tenant].” [ Guntert v. City of Stockton (1976) 55 CA3d 131,
140-141, 126 CR 690, 695 (internal quotes omitted), opn. on denial of rhng. 55
CA3d 131, 127 CR 602;  Lee v. Placer
Title Co. (1994) 28 CA4th 503, 513-514, 33 CR2d 572, 578;  Ginsberg v. Gamson (2012) 205 CA4th 873, 898,
141 CR3d 62, 81-82; see also  Nativi v.
Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co. (2014) 223 CA4th 261, 292, 167 CR3d 173, 199
(collecting cases)—“some authorities recognize that a tenant may sue for breach
of the covenant while remaining in possession”; and Erlach v. Sierra Asset
Servicing, LLC (2014) 226 CA4th 1281, 1300, 173 CR3d 159, 172 (same)]
 
Thus, the Court finds actual or
constructive eviction need not be pled in order to state a claim for breach of the
covenant of quiet enjoyment.  
ii.            
More than Mere Trivialities
While actual or constructive
eviction is no longer required, pursuant to Andrews v. Mobile Aire Estates
(2005) 125 Cal.App.4th 578, 588, in order to rise to the level of
breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, problems with the property must be
more than minor inconveniences or annoyances and must substantially interfere with
the tenant’s right to use and enjoy the premises for the purposes contemplated
by the tenancy.  
 
Defendant correctly notes that the
complaint fails to include allegations concerning the scope or duration of the
problems about which Plaintiff complains, or of how those problems have affected
the tenancy.  The cause of action alleges
that Defendants breached the covenant by failing to correct the habitability
conditions and by illegally and improperly installing fixtures in a manner that
caused gas leaks.  The cause of action
fails, however, to allege when Plaintiff reported the problems, how long the problems
persisted after they were reported, or any details about how the problems affected
the tenancy.  
 
The demurrer is sustained on the ground
that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for breach of the covenant
of quiet enjoyment.  Plaintiff seeks
leave to amend in the event the demurrer is sustained.  If Plaintiff can plead facts rising to the level
detailed above, Plaintiff is permitted leave to amend to do so.  
 
d.     Third
Cause of Action, Nuisance
Pursuant to Mendez v. Rancho
Valencia Resort Partners, LLC (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 248, 262-263,
cited in the demurrer, to support a cause of action for nuisance, the conduct
at issue must be unreasonable, meaning of such a nature, duration, or amount as
to constitute unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the property.  For the reasons detailed above in connection
with the covenant of quiet enjoyment cause of action, Plaintiff’s complaint
fails to do so.  The demurrer is therefore
sustained on the ground that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for
nuisance.  Again, leave to amend is
granted if and only if Plaintiff can plead facts rising to the level of
nuisance in an amended complaint.  
 
3.     Motion
to Strike
Defendant moves to strike Plaintiff’s
prayer for injunctive relief, punitive damages, statutory damages and
restitution, and attorneys’ fees, as well as the punitive damages allegations
in the body of the complaint.  Plaintiff failed
to timely file opposition to the motion. 
The Court finds the motion is well-taken, as Plaintiff has not pled a
basis for recovery of any of the above. 
The motion is therefore granted without leave to amend.  
 
4.     Case
Management Conference
The parties are reminded that there
is a CMC on calendar today concurrently with the hearing on the above demurrer
and motion to strike.  The Court asks
Counsel to make arrangements to appear remotely at the CMC and hearing on the demurrer
and motion to strike.
