Brown and Ann Brown Responding  Party: Defendant Michelle Pak  Motions  to Compel Further Responses to Request for Admissions (Set One) and Form  Interrogatories (Set Two)        The Court  considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply. Therefore, Plaintiffs’  Motion to Compel further responses to Requests for Admission, Set One is  GRANTED. Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel further responses to Form Interrogatories,  Set Two is GRANTED only as it pertains to RFAs No. 36-104. Ms. Pak is  ordered to provide verified code-compliant, supplemental responses to Request  for Admissions, Set One, Nos. 36-104, and Form Interrogatory, Set Two No. 17.1  within 30 days of this order. Plaintiffs’ motion  for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,560.00 is GRANTED, payable within 30  days of this order.              Background             On  November 8, 2023, Plaintiffs Baird A. Brown, an individual and as sole owner of  Baird Brown, a Professional Corporation, and Ann Brown (“Plaintiffs”) filed a  Complaint against defendants Donald G. Norris, an individual; Donald G. Norris,  a Law Corporation (“Norris Defendants”); Michelle Pak (“Ms. Pak”), an  individual; and Taurin Robinson (“Robinson”), an individual (collectively, “Defendants”),  and DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, alleging causes of action for (1) Elder  Financial Abuse – CA Welf. & Inst. Code § 15600 et seq; (2) Theft &  Conversion – CA Penal Code § 496(c); (3) Unfair Competition – CA Bus. &  Prof. Code § 17200 et seq; (4) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; and (5) Conspiracy.             The  Complaint alleges in pertinent part as follows: Ms. Pak, Mr. Brown’s former  office manager and Robinson, Mr. Brown’s former legal assistant conspired with  Norris Defendants to transfer Mr. Brown’s clients and his practice to Norris  Defendants. (Compl., ¶¶12-14.) Furthermore, defendants conspired to divert Mr.  Brown’s legal fees to Norris Defendants, and to substitute Norris Defendants as  counsel of record for many of Mr. Brown’s clients. (Id. at ¶16, 18.)  Additionally, defendants breached ethical responsibilities to timely send two  of Mr. Brown’s clients’ shares of their settlement funds, with Norris  Defendants, instead of Mr. Brown, receiving the attorney fees from the  settlements. (Id. at ¶17, 25.)             On  January 12, 2024, Norris Defendants filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiffs;  Andrew M. White, an individual; Jonathan N. White, an individual  (“Cross-Defendants”), and ROES 1-10, inclusive, alleging causes of action  for  (1) Conversion; (2) Violation of CA  Penal Code § 502; (3) Unfair Practices Act – CA Bus. & Prof. Code §17200 et  seq; (4) Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage; and (5) Breach of  Fiduciary Duty.             On  February 5, 2024, Ms. Pak filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiffs; Andrew M.  White, an individual; Jonathan N. White, an individual (“Cross-Defendants”),  and ROES 1-10, inclusive, alleging causes of action for (1) Breach of Contract;  (2) Money Had and Received; (3) Common Count - Open Book Account; (4) Common  Count - Account Stated; (5) Conversion; (6) Unauthorized Access to Computer  Files and Documents (Violation of CA Penal Code § 502); (7) Violation of the  Unfair Practices Act – CA Bus. & Prof. Code §17200 et seq; (8) Battery; (9)  Assault; (10) Sexual Battery; (11) Sexual Harassment in Violation of FEHA,  Gov’t Code 12940, et seq; (12) Failure to Prevent Sexual Harassment in  Violation of FEHA, Gov’t Code Sec. 12940(k); (13) Intentional Infliction of  Emotional Distress; and (14) Violations of the Elder And Dependent Adult Civil  Protection Act) (Wel. & Inst. § 15600, et seq.).             On  July 25, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion to compel further responses  from Defendant/Cross-Complainant Michelle Pak to (1) Request for Admissions  (Set One) and (2) Form Interrogatories (Set Two). On, August 22, 2024, Ms. Pak  filed an opposition to the motion. On August 29, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a  reply.     Timeliness              Notice  of the motion to compel further must be provided within 45 days of service of  the response, or any supplemental response, or on or before any specific later  date to which the parties have agreed.  (Code Civ. Pro., § 2030.300, subd.  (c).) This 45-day deadline runs from the date the verified response is served  and is extended for service by mail in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure  Sections 1010.6(a)(4) and 1013(a). (Ibid.) This is a jurisdictional  requirement. (Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Super. Ct. (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d  681, 685.)               Here,  on May 14, 2024, Ms. Pak served Further Responses to Plaintiffs’ Requests for  Admission, Set One (“RFAs”) and Form Interrogatories, Set Two (“FROGs”),  containing only objections and a lack of substantive responses. (White Decl., ¶  10, Exhibits G-1 and G-2.) On June 6, 2024, Ms. Pak served her Further Reponses  to Plaintiffs’ requests, following Plaintiff serving their Declaration for  Additional Discovery and Requests for Admission, Set One. (Id. ¶ 12,  Exhibit I.) Plaintiffs filed the instant motion on July 25, 2024, and the last  substantive response from Ms. Pak was on June 6, 2024, which is 49 days apart.              Thus,  the timeliness requirement is met.    Separate Statement  Motions to  compel further responses must always be accompanied by a separate statement  containing the requests and the responses, verbatim, as well as reasons why a  further response is warranted. (California Rule of Court, rule 3.1345(a).) The  separate statement must also be complete in itself; no extrinsic materials may  be incorporated by reference. (California Rule of Court, rule 3.1345(c).)  Here, on July  23, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a Separate Statement to the instant motion adhering  to the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a). Thus, this  requirement has been met.          Meet and Confer  The motion must  be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration in compliance with Code of Civil  Procedure Section 2016.040. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (b); Code Civ.  Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b).) Plaintiffs  advance the declaration of their counsel of record, Jonathan N. White,  attesting to the attempt to meet and confer made prior to the filing of the  instant motions. On June 13, 2024, Attorney White provided a meet and confer  letter to Ms. Pak’s counsel to identify the deficiencies in Ms. Pak’s responses  to Plaintiffs’ RFAs. (White Decl., ¶ 13.) On June 21, 2024, Ms. Pak’s counsel  provided their response to the meet and confer letter and refused to provide  further responses to Plaintiffs’ discovery requests. (Id. ¶ 14, Exhibit  K.) Plaintiffs’s counsel displayed a “reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal  resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., §  2016.040.)  Thus, Plaintiffs  sufficiently met and conferred in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure  Section 2016.04.    Discussion   Here, Plaintiffs  are seeking to compel further responses to their RFAs, Set One, Nos. 36-104 and  corresponding Form Interrogatory No. 17.1. (Motion, page 7.)  Request for Admissions  Regarding  requests for admissions, the only proper responses are to 1) admit, 2) deny, or  3) state that a reasonable inquiry concerning the matter in the particular  request has been made, and that the information known or readily obtainable is  insufficient to enable that party to admit the matter. (CCP § 2033.220(b).)  Where any portion of the request is true the party to whom it is directed must  admit that portion: “Each answer shall … [a]dmit so much of the matter involved  in the request as is true, either as expressed in the request itself or as  reasonably and clearly qualified by the responding party.” (CCP §  2033.220(b)(1).) Whether an admission is admitted to or denied, the admission  or denial must be “as complete and straightforward” as the information  available reasonably permits. (CCP. § 2033.220(a), (b)(1).)  Where responses  to requests for admissions have been served but requesting party believes that  they are deficient because the answers are evasive or incomplete or because an  objection is without merit, that party may move for an order compelling a  further response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (a).)  Here, on May 14,  2024, Ms. Pak served Further Responses to Plaintiffs’ Requests for Admission,  Set One (“RFAs”) and Form Interrogatories, Set Two (“FROGs”), containing only  objections and a lack of substantive responses. (White Decl., ¶ 10, Exhibits  G-1 and G-2.) On May 21, 2024, Plaintiffs served their Declaration for  Additional Discovery and Requests for Admission, Set One. (Id., Exhibit  H-2.) On June 6, 2024, Ms. Pak served her Further Reponses to Plaintiffs’  requests, which contained many of the same objections as before, as well as  refusing to provide responses to RFAs Nos. 36-104 because “[t]he requesting  party has exceeded the numerical limit imposed by Code of Civil Procedure  section 2033.030(b)” (Id., Exhibit G-1.) Ms. Pak has refused to provide  responses to RFAs Nos. 36-104 on the basis that Plaintiffs served their  Declaration for Additional Discovery “over one month later after they served  their RFAs on Ms. Pak and after they already received Ms. Pak’s initial  responses with objection as to the exceeding the limit of requests.”  (Opposition, page 6.)              According  to Code of Civil Procedure Section 2033.030, “[u]nless a declaration as  described in Section 2033.050 has been made, a party need only respond to the  first 35 admission requests served that do not relate to the genuineness of  documents, if that party states an objection to the balance under Section  2033.230  on the ground  that the limit has been exceeded.”  Here, Ms. Pak was correct in objecting to RFAs Nos. 36-104  because Plaintiffs did not provide a Declaration for Further Discovery  accompanying their initial service of RFAs, Set One. However, on May 21, 2024,  Plaintiffs then served their Declaration for Further Discovery, which was followed  by Ms. Pak refusing to provide responses because Plaintiffs served the  Declaration after Ms. Pak provided her initial responses. (White Decl., Exhibit  G-1.) There is no reason that Ms. Pak refused to provide responses to RFAs Nos.  36-104, since Plaintiffs eventually cured by serving a Declaration for Further  Discovery that is compliant with Code of Civil Procedure  Section 2033.050. Additionally, Plaintiffs’ counsel attempted to meet and  confer with Ms. Pak regarding this issue, and Ms. Pak again objected to the  overlimit of the RFAs on the same grounds of Plaintiffs providing the  Declaration for Further Discovery Ms. Pak served her initial responses. Code of  Civil Procedure Section 2033.030, subdivision (b) states that “unless a  declaration . . . has been made, a party need only respond to the first 35  admission requests . . . .” In accordance with the Code, Plaintiffs provided  Ms. Pak with a Declaration, so Ms. Pak could not have refused to respond to  Plaintiffs’ RFAs Nos. 36-104. Thus, Ms. Pak is compelled to provide further responses to Request for  Admissions (Set One) Nos. 36-104 that are code-compliant.               Form Interrogatories  Code of Civil  Procedure section 2030.220, subdivision (a) requires that “[e]ach answer in a  response to interrogatories shall be as complete and straightforward as the  information reasonably available to the responding party permits.” Pursuant to  Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, a party may move to compel further  responses to a form interrogatory if the other party’s answer is “evasive or  incomplete.” A response must “represent the interrogated party's present best  and complete answer.” (Fuss v. Sup. Ct. (1969) 273 Cal.App.2d 807, 816.) Where  respondents object or respond inadequately as to discovery requests, a motion  lies to compel further responses, as to which respondent has the burden to  justify the objections.¿ (Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Sup. Ct. (2000) 22  Cal.4th 245, 255.)¿ Where general boilerplate objections are made, courts  have authority to compel further responses (but not to find a waiver of  privilege objections).¿ (Best Products, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2004) 119  Cal.App. 4th 1181, 1189.)¿  Plaintiffs move  to compel Ms. Pak to serve a further response to FROG No. 17.1. FROG 17.1  relates to the Requests for Admissions, Set One, which was served alongside  Form Interrogatories, Set Two. (White Decl., Exhibit F-2.) The interrogatory  asked Ms. Pak: “Is your response to each request for admission served with  these interrogatories an unqualified admission? If not, for each response that  is not an unqualified admission:    state       the number of the request;    state       all facts upon which you base your response;    state       the names, ADDRESSES, and telephone numbers of all PERSONS who have       knowledge of those facts; and    identify       all DOCUMENTS and other tangible things that support your response and       state the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the PERSON who has each       DOCUMENT or thing.” (Id.)   Ms. Pak’s provided  further responses to RFAs Nos. 1-35 in her responses that were given on June 6,  2024. (White Decl., Exhibit. I-2.) Ms. Pak stated the number of the request and  provided facts upon which she based her responses. (Id.) She provided  the names of the parties who would have knowledge of the facts, including, Lucas  Granillo, Michelle Pak, and Don Norris. (Id.) She also identified  documents or other tangible things to support her responses, including text  messages and an email. (Id.) Ms. Pak further stated that “all  information she provided is what is currently available to her. Should Ms. Pak  acquire additional information or documents, she will amend and/or supplement  this response.” (Opposition, Exhibit F.) Thus, Ms. Pak is not compelled to  provide further responses to FROG 17.1 as it pertains to RFAs. Nos. 1-35.  As for FROG 17.1  relating to RFAs Nos. 36-104, Ms. Pak must provide her responses because, as  stated above, Ms. Pak cannot claim that refusing to respond to RFAs. Nos.  36-104 is justified on the basis that Plaintiffs did not serve a Declaration  for Further Discovery. Thus, Ms. Pak is compelled to provide further responses  to FROG 17.1 as it pertains to RFAs. Nos. 36-104.   Sanctions “The court shall  impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)  against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a  motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that  the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that  other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ.  Proc. § 2030.300(d).)¿¿¿ CCP  section 2033.290(d) provides for mandatory monetary sanctions “against any  party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to  compel further response, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction  acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the  imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §  2033.290(d).)     Here,  Plaintiffs argue that “Ms. Pak knowingly and intentionally provided meritless  boilerplate objections, and withheld responsive answers to Plaintiffs'  discovery requests,” and that Ms. Pak should be sanctioned $1,560.00. (Motion,  page 24.) Ms. Pak argues that Plaintiffs “have filed the instant Motion to  Compel without any basis” and “in bad faith,” and that Plaintiffs should be  sanctioned $4,250.00. (Opposition, page 7.)  As explained  above, Ms. Pak had no reason to deny responses to Plaintiffs’ RFAs Nos. 36-104  on the basis that the 35-interrogatory limit was exceeded because Plaintiffs  eventually provided a Declaration for Further Discovery, compliant with Code of  Civil Procedure Section 2033.030, subdivision (b). Ms. Pak also refused to  provide her responses after Plaintiffs sent a meet and confer letter attempting  to informally resolve the issue. (Opposition, Exhibit F.) Further, Ms. Pak has  failed to provide substantial justification to explain why she continuously  refused to give substantive answers to Plaintiffs’ RFAs Nos. 36-104, despite  Plaintiffs having cured and provided a Declaration for Further Discovery. Thus,  sanctions against Ms. Pak would be proper.  Here,  Plaintiffs’ counsel provides a declaration attesting to the calculation of the  sanctions sought. (White Decl., ¶ 18-19.) He states that his hourly rate is  $300/hour and that he spent over 15 hours on this matter, including drafting  one motion, one separate statement, one proposed orders, one declaration,  compiling declaration exhibits, finalizing all documents, anticipated work on  the reply, and anticipated preparation and appearance for the hearings. (Id.  ¶ 19.) This totals $4,500.00. However, Plaintiffs only requested $1,560.00  in expenses and attorneys’ fees in their Motion. This would amount to 5.2 hours  of work on the motion, at Plaintiffs’ counsel rate of 300$/hour. The Court find  this a reasonable amount of time to work on the motion, and a reasonable fee  per hour, given counsel’s experience in civil litigations, transactional law  and privacy law. The court will award what the Plaintiffs explicitly requested  in sanctions.    Conclusion Therefore, Plaintiffs’  Motion to Compel further responses to Requests for Admission, Set One is  GRANTED.  Plaintiffs’  Motion to Compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set Two is GRANTED  only as it pertains to RFAs No. 36-104.  Plaintiffs’ motion  for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,560.00 is GRANTED. Ms. Pak’s request  for monetary sanctions is DENIED.      It is so ordered.   Dated: October 4, 2024   _______________________ MEL RED RECANA Judge of the  Superior Court      Superior Court of

considered the moving papers, oppositions, and replies.Norris
Defendants’ and Taurin Robinson’s Motions to Compel further responses to Requests
for Production, Set One are DENIED as moot. Norris Defendants’
and Taurin Robinson’s motions for monetary sanctions are DENIED.            Background            On
November 8, 2023, Plaintiffs Baird A. Brown, an individual and as sole owner of
Baird Brown, a Professional Corporation, and Ann Brown (“Plaintiffs”) filed a
Complaint against defendants Donald G. Norris, an individual; Donald G. Norris,
a Law Corporation (“Norris Defendants”); Michelle Pak (“Ms. Pak”), an
individual; and Taurin Robinson (“Robinson”), an individual (collectively, “Defendants”),
and DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, alleging causes of action for (1) Elder
Financial Abuse – CA Welf. & Inst. Code § 15600 et seq; (2) Theft &
Conversion – CA Penal Code § 496(c); (3) Unfair Competition – CA Bus. &
Prof. Code § 17200 et seq; (4) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; and (5) Conspiracy.            The
Complaint alleges in pertinent part as follows: Ms. Pak, Mr. Brown’s former
office manager and Robinson, Mr. Brown’s former legal assistant conspired with
Norris Defendants to transfer Mr. Brown’s clients and his practice to Norris
Defendants. (Compl., ¶¶12-14.) Furthermore, defendants conspired to divert Mr.
Brown’s legal fees to Norris Defendants, and to substitute Norris Defendants as
counsel of record for many of Mr. Brown’s clients. (Id. at ¶16, 18.)
Additionally, defendants breached ethical responsibilities to timely send two
of Mr. Brown’s clients’ shares of their settlement funds, with Norris
Defendants, instead of Mr. Brown, receiving the attorney fees from the
settlements. (Id. at ¶17, 25.)            On
January 12, 2024, Norris Defendants filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiffs;
Andrew M. White, an individual; Jonathan N. White, an individual
(“Cross-Defendants”), and ROES 1-10, inclusive, alleging causes of action
for  (1) Conversion; (2) Violation of CA
Penal Code § 502; (3) Unfair Practices Act – CA Bus. & Prof. Code §17200 et
seq; (4) Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage; and (5) Breach of
Fiduciary Duty.            On
February 5, 2024, Ms. Pak filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiffs; Andrew M.
White, an individual; Jonathan N. White, an individual (“Cross-Defendants”),
and ROES 1-10, inclusive, alleging causes of action for (1) Breach of Contract;
(2) Money Had and Received; (3) Common Count - Open Book Account; (4) Common
Count - Account Stated; (5) Conversion; (6) Unauthorized Access to Computer
Files and Documents (Violation of CA Penal Code § 502); (7) Violation of the
Unfair Practices Act – CA Bus. & Prof. Code §17200 et seq; (8) Battery; (9)
Assault; (10) Sexual Battery; (11) Sexual Harassment in Violation of FEHA,
Gov’t Code 12940, et seq; (12) Failure to Prevent Sexual Harassment in
Violation of FEHA, Gov’t Code Sec. 12940(k); (13) Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress; and (14) Violations of the Elder And Dependent Adult Civil
Protection Act) (Wel. & Inst. § 15600, et seq.).            On
May 23, 2024, Defendants/Cross-Complainants Norris Defendants and Taurin
Robinson each filed a motion to compel further responses from Plaintiffs to Requests
for Production (Set One.) On September 20, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an opposition
to each of the  motions. On September 26,
2024, Norris Defendants and Taurin Robinson filed replies.   Timeliness             A
motion to compel a further response to a request for production must be noticed
within 45 days of the service of the response, or any supplemental response, or
on or before any specific later date to which the propounding party and the
responding party have agreed in writing. Otherwise, the propounding party
waives any right to compel further response to the inspection demand. (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(c); see also Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1409; Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Superior Court (1983) 147
Cal.App.3d 681, 685.)            Here,
on January 29, 2024, Norris Defendants and Taurin Robinson propounded the
Requests for Production of Documents (“RFPDs”) that are the subject of these
motions. (Oh Decl. ¶¶ 2-3, Ex. 1A-11A.) On February 14, 2024, the parties
agreed to an extension to March 25, 2024 for Plaintiffs to provide
code-compliant responses. (White Decl., Exhibit C.) On March 25, 2024,
Plaintiffs served their responses to Norris Defendants’ and Taurin Robinson’s RFPDs,
which cited numerous privacy and confidentiality issues that necessitated the
entry of a protective order. (Id. ¶ 7.) The parties then pursued
extensive correspondence regarding the entry of an SPO. (Id. ¶ 8.) On
May 16, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel sent a meet and confer letter and produced
documents claimed to not be subject to an SPO. (Oh Decl., Exhibit 18.)             Here,
Plaintiffs provided responses to Norris Defendants’ and Taurin Robinson’s RFPDs
on March 25, 2024. While it may be argued that the meet and confer letter
providing a production of documents Plaintiffs believed to not be subject to a
potential SPO, the May 16, 2024 production of documents was not accompanied
with verification. Thus, the May 16, 2024 production would not be considered a
“supplemental response” according to Code Civil Procedure Section 2031.310
subdivision (c). Given that Plaintiffs provided their verified responses to
Norris Defendants’ and Taurin Robinson’s RFPDs on March 25, 2024 and Norris
Defendants and Taurin Robinson filed their motions on May 23, 2024, which is 60
days after service of the responses, their motions are timely. Thus, the
timeliness requirement is met. Separate Statement Motions to
compel further responses must always be accompanied by a separate statement
containing the requests and the responses, verbatim, as well as reasons why a
further response is warranted. (California Rule of Court, rule 3.1345(a).) The
separate statement must also be complete in itself; no extrinsic materials may
be incorporated by reference. (California Rule of Court, rule 3.1345(c).) Here, on May 23,
2024, Counsel for Norris Defendants and Taurin Robinson filed a Separate
Statement to the instant motion adhering to the requirements of California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a). Thus, this requirement has been met.  Meet and Confer The motion must
be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration in compliance with Code of Civil
Procedure Section 2016.040. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (b); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b).)Norris
Defendants and Taurin Robinson advance the declaration of their counsel of
record, Seungjai Oh, attesting to attempt to meet and confer made prior to the
filing of the instant motions. (Oh Decl, ¶ 10.) On April 29, 2024, Attorney Oh
sent a meet and confer letter to Plaintiffs’ counsel to address the Plaintiffs’
non-code-compliant discovery responses to Norris Defendants’ and Taurin
Robinson’s RFPDs. (Id.) On May 3, 2024, the parties agreed to extend the
deadline to respond to the meet and confer to May 16, 2024, and Norris
Defendants’ and Taurin Robinson’s deadline to file motions to May 23, 2024. (Id.
¶ 11.) On May 16, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel sent a meet and confer response
letter and produced documents claimed to not be subject to a stipulated
protective order (“SPO”). (Id. ¶ 13.) On May 23, 2024, Norris Defendants
and Taurin Robinson filed the instant motions. Counsel for Norris Defendants and
Taurin Robinson displayed a “reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal
resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2016.040.) Thus, Norris
Defendants and Taurin Robinson sufficiently met and conferred in compliance
with Code of Civil Procedure Section 2016.04.  Discussion
Here, Norris
Defendants and Taurin Robinson are seeking to compel further responses to their
Request for Further Production, Set One.  Request for ProductionAny party may
obtain any discovery of information, documents, land, property or
electronically stored information so long as the discoverable matter is not
privileged, is relevant to the subject matter and can lead one to admissible
evidence.¿(Code Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.) A party can demand the production of
documents that is in the “possession, custody, or control of the party whom the
demand is made.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.010.) If a court determines the scope
of discovery imposes a burden, causes great expense or is intrusive,¿and such
outweighs the likelihood that the discoverable information sought will garner
admissible evidence, the court shall limit the scope of discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2017.020.)¿¿             When
responses to an RPD are deficient, the propounding party may file a motion to
compel further responses. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310.) A motion to compel
further responses to RPDs may be brought when the responses contain: (1) “a
statement of compliance when the demand is incomplete;” (2) “answers that are
inadequate, incomplete or evasive;” and (3) “an objection to a particular
request is without merit or too general.” (Id.)¿¿ ¿           A
motion to compel further responses must set forth specific facts showing good
cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310(b)(1).)¿It is not necessary for the motion to show that the material
sought will be admissible as¿evidence. “Good cause” may be found to justify
discovery where specific facts show that the discovery is necessary for
effective trial preparation or to¿prevent surprise at trial. (Associated
Brewers Dist. Co. v. Superior Court¿(1967) 65 Cal.2d 583, 586-58.)            Here,
Norris Defendants and Taurin Robinson do not dispute that Plaintiffs eventually
provided Norris Defendants and Taurin Robinson with Supplemental Responses
along with all requested documents. (Reply, page 2.) Norris Defendants and
Taurin Robinson concede that on September 19, 2024, Plaintiffs amended the
discovery responses to Norris Defendants’ and Taurin Robinson’s RFPDs and
“produced substantial discovery production.” (Id.) Norris Defendants
further do not argue that these supplemental responses are not code-compliant.
(Id.)            Thus,
Norris Defendants’ and Taurin Robinson’s Motions to Compel Further Responses to
their RFPDs are moot.  SanctionsNotwithstanding
the above, Norris Defendants and Taurin Robinson suggest that their request for
sanctions is still at issue. “The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2030.300(d).) Code of Civil Procedure Section 2033.290(d) provides for
mandatory monetary sanctions “against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response, unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290(d).)   Here, sanctions
against Plaintiffs would not be appropriate. Norris Defendants and Taurin
Robinson argue that sanctions against Plaintiffs are warranted because of the
extensive delay in providing the discovery responses to Norris Defendants’ and
Taurin Robinson’s RFPDs. Norris Defendants and Taurin Robinson suggest that Plaintiffs
did not produce any documents until May 16, 2024, when Plaintiffs provided
documents that they believed were not subject to an SPO. (White Decl., ¶ 7.) According
to Norris Defendants and Taurin Robinson, Plaintiffs did not provide
code-compliant responses. (Motion, page 3.) Though, the parties were engaging
in correspondence relating to the execution an SPO when Attorney Oh rescinded
and voided his signatures on all versions of SPOs, indicating that negotiations
did not prove to be fruitful. (Oh Decl, ¶ 12.) This Court then granted
Plaintiffs a Protective Order on August 19, 2024. (Id. ¶ 8.) On
September 19, 2024, Plaintiffs then produced substantial discovery production
in compliance with the Court’s Protective Order. (Reply, page 2; see 08/19/24
Protective Order) This Court finds
that Plaintiffs did not substantially delay discovery. Plaintiffs provided
supplemental production on the agreed extension deadline of May 16, 2024 with
documents Plaintiffs’ counsel believed to not be subject to an SPO. (Oh Decl.,
¶ 13-14.) This Court then entered a protective order on August 19, 2024 and
Plaintiffs provided Norris Defendants and Taurin Robinson with substantive
responses to their RFPDs 30 days later in compliance with the Court’s
protective order. (White Decl., ¶ 8-9.) The justification that Plaintiffs had
in refusing to provide further document production on May 16, 2024 (that some
documents should be subject to a protective order) thus proved to be accurate
given the Court’s entry of the protective order. Therefore,
Norris Defendants’ motion for sanctions is DENIED.  ConclusionBased on the
foregoing, Norris Defendants’ and Taurin Robinson’s Motions to Compel further
responses to Requests for Production, Set One are DENIED as moot. Norris
Defendants’ and Taurin Robinson’s motions for monetary sanctions are DENIED. It is so ordered. Dated: October 4, 2024 _______________________MEL RED RECANAJudge of the
