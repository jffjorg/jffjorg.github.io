And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion to compel further responses to the Request for Production, Set One, filed by the plaintiff, Jeff Steven Eustice. The defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., is ordered to provide further responses to the plaintiff's Request for Production, Set One Numbers 16, 17, 18, 29, 20, and 21 within twenty (20) days' notice of this order.

The court found that the plaintiff had satisfied the meet and confer requirements, and the plaintiff's requests for discovery were appropriate. The court also agreed that the defendant's objections to the discovery requests were unconvincing, and that the information requested was necessary to support the plaintiff's claims.

The court noted that the defendant's objections that the discovery requests were overly broad, not reasonably calculated to lead to discoverable evidence, and that they required the disclosure of private information were unconvincing. The court also found that the defendant had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its claims of undue burden and expense.

The court ordered the defendant to provide further responses to the plaintiff's Request for Production, Set One, and directed the moving party to give notice.
