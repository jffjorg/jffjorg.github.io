Motion to Bifurcate 




MOVING PARTIES:


Defendant Lisa Marie Vernola Salas




OPPOSING PARTY:


Plaintiff Urban Soccer 5 Center LLC


             Defendant Lisa Marie Vernola Salas,
individually and as trustee of the Vernola Family Trust (“Defendant”) moves to
bifurcate the issue of punitive damages.             Defendant is entitled to try the issue of whether Plaintiff Urban Soccer
5 Center LLC (“Plaintiff”) is to be awarded punitive damages before evidence of
defendant’s financial condition is to be admitted.  (See Civ. Code, § 3295, subd. (d) [“The court
shall, on application of any defendant, preclude the admission of evidence of
that defendant’s profits or financial condition until after the trier of fact
returns a verdict for plaintiff awarding actual damages and finds that a
defendant is guilty of malice, oppression, or fraud in accordance with Section
3294”].)  While Plaintiff purports to
oppose the motion, Plaintiff fails to address the applicable statute, which
requires the court to grant the motion, and it is hereby granted.
Defendant is
ordered to provide notice of this order and file proof of service of same.
