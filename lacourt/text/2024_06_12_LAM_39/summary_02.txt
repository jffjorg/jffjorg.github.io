And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling in a case where the defendant, Sun Plaza LLC, moves to quash the service of summons and complaint. The plaintiff, Anthony Bouyer, has not opposed the motion. The defendant asserts that its designated agent for service of process is Shalizeh Bashirian, and that she can be served at 7800 Berger Avenue, Playa Del Rey, California. However, the plaintiff served Sohail Bashirian at 1428 W. 47th Street in Los Angeles through substituted service of a co-occupant who refused service. The court finds that this proof of service does not reflect proper service on the defendant through its designated agent for service of process. The court also notes that Sohail Bashirian has never been authorized to accept service on the defendant's behalf. As a result, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving the facts requisite to an effective service. However, the plaintiff has not satisfied this burden. Therefore, the motion to quash is granted.
