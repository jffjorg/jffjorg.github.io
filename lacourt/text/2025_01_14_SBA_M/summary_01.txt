And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Ford Motor Company's motion for a protective order to limit discovery and protect confidential information. The Judge found that Ford has failed to establish good cause for the proposed protective order, and that the Los Angeles Superior Court Model Order already provides adequate protections to prevent unwarranted dissemination of confidential information. The Judge noted that Ford's proposed modifications to the Model Order are not necessary and would disrupt Plaintiff's counsel's ability to maintain their own work product. The Judge ordered the parties to continue to meet and confer to discuss and enter into any revisions to the Model Order.
