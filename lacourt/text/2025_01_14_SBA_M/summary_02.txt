And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Otto Benedict's motion to set aside the default. The motion was filed pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b), which allows a party to relieve a default judgment due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.

The judge found that the default was entered due to the mistake, inadvertence, surprise, and/or neglect of Defendant's counsel, Jason A. Kilpatrick. Specifically, Kilpatrick failed to file a responsive pleading despite obtaining information that Defendant had been served.

The judge granted the motion and set aside the default. The judge also ordered Plaintiff's counsel to pay a penalty of $99.00 to Defendant for the admitted fault of Kilpatrick. The penalty is derived from the purported 0.2 hours to prepare the entry of default with an hourly rate of $495 per hour.

The judge ordered Defendant to give notice of this ruling.
