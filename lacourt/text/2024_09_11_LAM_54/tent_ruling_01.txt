PLAINTIFF TO
NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative,

The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received. 
 
A party waives their right to a jury
trial by failing to timely post jury fees. (CCP § 631(e)(5).) Jury fees must be
paid “on or before the date scheduled for the initial case management
conference in the action.” (CCP § 631(c).) “The court may, in its discretion
upon just terms, allow a trial by jury although there may have been a waiver of
a trial by jury.” (CCP § 631(g).) “In exercising such discretion, courts are
mindful of the requirement ‘to resolve doubts in interpreting the waiver
provisions of section 631 in favor of a litigant's right to jury trial.’” (Tesoro
del Valle Master Homeowners Assn. v. Griffin (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 619,
638, quoting Grafton Partners v. Superior Court (2005) 36 Cal.4th 944,
956.) When evaluating relief from waiver, the question is whether any other
party will suffer prejudice from the relief from waiver. (Id.)
 
Plaintiff moves
for relief of jury waiver on the grounds of mistake. Plaintiff filed a demand
for jury trial with the complaint, on November 10, 2021. Plaintiff’s counsel
realized later that jury fees inadvertently had not been posted; Plaintiff posted
them on July 26, 2023. There is no opposition to this motion showing prejudice
from relief from jury waiver. The Court finds good cause to grant relief from
jury waiver.
 
Plaintiff’s
motion is GRANTED.
