And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a case between PropCo and Keyway, and has been presented with arguments and citations from both sides. PropCo has cited two unpublished federal court cases as persuasive authority, which is permissible under California Rules of Court. The judge notes that the term "Principal" is often used by sophisticated parties, but has no legal meaning in the context of a LLC such as Keyway. Instead, Keyway has members, managers, and officers who may be authorized to act. The judge is considering the significance of Leissner signing documents as a principal of Keyway and whether this put PropCo and Chicago Title on notice that Leissner was not signing in a legal capacity with authority. The judge's tentative ruling is that PropCo's arguments are persuasive and may be considered in the upcoming court hearing.
