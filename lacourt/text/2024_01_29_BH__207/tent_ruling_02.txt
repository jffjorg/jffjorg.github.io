unpublished federal district court cases. 
“Although [a court] may not rely on unpublished California cases, the
California Rules of Court do not prohibit citation to unpublished federal
cases, which may properly be cited as persuasive, although not binding,
authority.”  (Landmark Screens, LLC v.
Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, LLP (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 238, 251, fn. 6,
citing in part Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.1115.)  


[2] “The use of the term Principal was also a red flag
for sophisticated parties such as Propco, Chicago Title and their team of
lawyers and professionals. Principal has no legal meaning with respect to a LLC
such as Keyway. Rather, LLCs have members, managers and officers who may be
authorized to act. As such, the fact that Leissner was signing documents as a
principal of Keyway put Propco and Chicago Title on notice that Leissner was
not signing in a legal capacity with authority.” (FAC ¶ 24, fn. 2.)
