And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on several causes of action brought by Keyway Pride Limited LLC against PropCo LLC and its affiliates. Keyway alleges that PropCo and its affiliates fraudulently transferred property to them and are seeking to quiet title to the property, cancel the transfer, and seek declaratory relief and unfair competition law claims.

The judge has overruled PropCo's demurrer to the second cause of action for violation of Penal Code section 496, which prohibits buying or receiving stolen property. The judge found that Keyway's allegations were sufficient to state a cause of action and that PropCo had not shown that Keyway lacked standing to bring the claim.

The judge has also overruled PropCo's demurrer to the third cause of action for declaratory relief, finding that the relief sought is not duplicative of the quiet title/cancellation cause of action and that the issues presented are still live and ongoing.

Finally, the judge has denied PropCo's demurrer to the sixth cause of action for unfair competition law claims, finding that Keyway has standing to bring the claims and that the underlying violation of law is sufficient to support the claims.
