And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to strike the complaint's claims for punitive damages. The defendants had argued that the complaint did not adequately plead the necessary elements for punitive damages, specifically that the defendants had engaged in malice, oppression, or fraud. However, the judge found that the complaint's allegations were sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge noted that the complaint alleged that the defendants had failed to remedy defects in the property, had intentionally failed to make timely repairs, and had been aware of the defects and failed to correct them despite being cited by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. The judge concluded that these allegations were sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages and denied the motion to strike.
