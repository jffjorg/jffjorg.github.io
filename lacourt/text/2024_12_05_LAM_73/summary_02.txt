And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants two motions filed by the plaintiff, Merik Migliore, to compel the defendant, Premier Automotive of Placentia, LLC dba Premier Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram of Buena Park, to respond to requests for production of documents and special interrogatories. The plaintiff filed the motions on September 4, 2024, and the defendant failed to respond. The judge finds that the defendant waived its right to object to the requests and orders the defendant to provide verified, objection-free responses within 20 days. The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2017.010, 2030.260, 2030.290, and 2031.300, which govern discovery and the timing of responses to requests for production of documents and special interrogatories.
