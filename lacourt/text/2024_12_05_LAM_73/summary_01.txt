And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees. The plaintiff, Herschell Duerson, brought this action against defendants Timothy Carter and others for breach of contract, promissory estoppel, fraud, and unjust enrichment. Duerson argues that he is entitled to recover attorney's fees incurred in this action because he prevailed on his claims and defendants committed fraud. However, the court finds that California Civil Code Section 3336, which allows recovery of damages for money expended in pursuit of converted property, does not mention recovery of attorney's fees incurred due to fraud. The court also finds that Gray v. Don Miller & Assocs., Inc. (1984) 35 Cal. 3d 498 does not support the plaintiff's assertion that attorney's fees are recoverable in cases involving fraud or deceit. Therefore, the plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees is denied.
