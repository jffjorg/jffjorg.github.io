Automotive of Placentia, LLC dba Premier Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram of Buena Park’s objection free responses to Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One and a Motion

II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard 
 
A responding
party has 30 days after service of interrogatories to serve their responses on
the propounding party. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a).) However, if
interrogatories are served by electronic service, a responding party has an
additional two (2) court days to respond. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd.
(a)(3)(B).)  
 
If the
responding party fails to timely respond to the interrogatories, “The party to
whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise the option
to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the
interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010).” (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)  
  
Furthermore,
the party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling
response to the interrogatories. (Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b),
2031.300, subd. (b).) And “Unlike a motion to compel further responses, a
motion to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit, and the
propounding party does not have to demonstrate either good cause or that it
satisfied a ‘meet and confer’ requirement.” (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.)   
 
Under CCP §
2017.010, “any party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged,
that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action..., if
the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”  The Section
specifically provides that “[d]iscovery may relate to the claim or defense of
the party seeking discovery or of any other party to the action,” and that
discovery “may be obtained of the identity and location of persons having
knowledge of any discoverable matter, as well as of the existence, description,
nature, custody, condition and location of any document, electronically stored
information, tangible thing, or land or other property.”   
 
B.      Discussion
On July 5,
2024, Plaintiff served Requests for Production of Documents (Set One) and Special
Interrogatories (Set One) on Defendant Premier
Automotive of Placentia, LLC dba Premier Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram of Buena Park. (Azimtash Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A.) The
responses were due on or about August 7, 2024. As of the date of this motion, no
requests for an extension of time or responses have been served. (Id. at
¶ 8.) No opposition to Plaintiff’s motions have been filed. As such, the Court GRANTS both of Plaintiff’s
motions.
