Code Civ. Proc.
§ 708.510(a) provides for assignment orders and states: 
 
(a) Except as otherwise provided by
law, upon application of the judgment creditor on noticed motion, the court may
order the judgment debtor to assign to the judgment creditor or to a receiver
appointed pursuant to Article 7 (commencing with Section 708.610) all or part
of a right to payment due or to become due, whether or not the right is
conditioned on future developments, including but not limited to the following
types of payments: (1) wages due from the federal government that are not
subject to withholding under an earnings withholding order. (2) Rents. (3)
Commissions. (4) Royalties. (5) Payments due from a patent or copyright. (6)
Insurance policy loan value.
A court may
take into consideration all relevant factors in determining whether to issue an
assignment order, though the right to payment may be assigned only to the
extent necessary to satisfy the creditor’s money judgment and, where part of
the payments are exempt, the amount of payments assigned should not exceed the
difference between the gross amount of the payments and the exempt amount. (CCP
§§ 708.510 (c), (d) (e) and (f).) The burden is on the debtor to show that an
exemption applies. (CCP § 703.580(b).)
