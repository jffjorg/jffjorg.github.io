And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting leave to Moon Pool LLC to file a Third Amended Complaint (TAC) against Bruce Hitchman, et al. The TAC seeks to add three additional causes of action for intentional interference with contract, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and declaratory relief. The Judge found that the proposed amendments were timely and did not demonstrate any prejudice to the opposing party. The Judge also noted that the proposed amendments did not contain any invalid causes of action and that the court has a liberal policy of permitting amendments. Therefore, the Judge granted the motion for leave to file the TAC and ordered Moon Pool to file the proposed TAC within five days of the date of the order.
