And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendants' motion to quash service of the summons and complaint. The defendants, Shaquille O'Neal and Michael Parris, argued that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over them because they are not California residents and do not have a sufficient relationship with the state. However, the court found that the defendants failed to present any admissible evidence to support their claims. The court concluded that the defendants did not purposefully avail themselves of the privilege of conducting activities in California and therefore did not establish a basis for specific jurisdiction. The court deemed the defendants to have made a general appearance and ordered them to file a demurrer, answer, or other responsive pleading within 30 days.
