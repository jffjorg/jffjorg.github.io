The tentative ruling is regarding a case between Anthony Russo (Plaintiff) and the City of Pasadena and Pasadena Police Department (Defendants). The Plaintiff claims wrongful employment actions and alleges four causes of action, including whistleblower retaliation, violation of due process, and violation of the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act. The Defendants demurred to the Plaintiff's complaint, arguing that the Plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies. The Court sustained the Defendants' demurrer to the Plaintiff's second cause of action for whistleblower retaliation and the Pasadena Police Department's demurrer to the entirety of the Plaintiff's complaint. The Court also denied the Defendants' motion to strike the Plaintiff's prayer for damages and references to the Pasadena Police Department.
