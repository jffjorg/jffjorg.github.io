And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively granted the defendants' motion to continue the trial date from December 16, 2024 to January 21 or 27, 2024. The defendants are seeking a continuance because one of their lawyers, Dr. Adams, will be unavailable on the original trial date due to a pre-paid vacation. The judge has considered the factors set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subdivision (c) and found that good cause exists to continue the trial. The judge has also noted that the parties had previously stipulated to a continuance of the trial date and that the original trial date is still several months away. The judge has ordered the prevailing party to give notice and will allow oral argument from plaintiff's counsel as to why they did not file an opposition brief.
