I.                   
Background  
 
On
January 4, 2024, Plaintiff, Michael Shapiro (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint
against Defendant, United Parcel Service, Inc., and DOES 1 through 50. The
Complaint alleges causes of action for: (1) Motor Vehicle Negligence; and (2)
General Negligence.  UPS field an Answer
on February 14, 2024, and the first CMC is not set until July 31, 2024.  
 
On
May 23, 2024, Plaintiff, Michael Shapiro’s attorney, Evan Ghaffari, Esq.
(“Ghaffari”) filed a Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.  
 
II.                
Legal Standard & Discussion  
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 284 states that
“the attorney in an action…may be changed at any time before or after judgment
or final determination, as follows: (1) upon the consent of both client and
attorney…; (2) upon the order of the court, upon the application of either
client or attorney, after notice from one to the other.”  (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 284; CRC 3.1362.)  The withdrawal request may be denied if it would
cause an injustice or undue delay in proceeding; but the court's discretion in
this area is one to be exercised reasonably.  (See Mandell v. Superior
(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4; Lempert¿v. Superior Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173.) 
 
In making a motion to be relieved as
counsel, the attorney must comply with procedures set forth in Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1362.  The motion must be made using mandatory forms: Notice of
Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel directed to the client – Civil
(MC-051); Declaration “stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship” reasons the motion was
brought (MC-052); and a Proposed Order (MC-053).  (Ibid.)  The
forms must be filed and served on all parties who have appeared in the
case.  (Ibid.) 
 
Here, Michael Shapiro’s counsel,
Ghaffari, moves the Court to relieve him as attorney of record for Plaintiff.
Ghaffari properly filed a Notice of Motion, Motion to be Relieved as Counsel,
Declaration, and Proposed Order in accordance with Cal. Rules of Court 3.1362.
On May 23, 2024, all forms for the pending motion were served on Michael
Shapiro by mail. Further, Ghaffari notes that Michael Shapiro’s last known
address has been confirmed within the past 30 days via telephone. Further, on May
23, 2024, proof of service for said documents were filed with the Court. 
 
In the declaration Ghaffari
notes that he and the client have communicative differences that cannot be
resolved.   
 
Since Plaintiff, Michael
Shapiro’s attorney has complied with all procedural requirements in filing a
motion to be relieved as counsel and because the withdrawal would not cause an
injustice or undue delay in proceedings, the Court finds that withdrawal of Evan Ghaffari as
attorney of record for Plaintiff, Michael Shapiro can be accomplished without
undue prejudice to his interests. 
 
III.             
Conclusion & Order 
 
For the foregoing reasons, Evan
Ghaffari’s, Motion to Be Relieved As Counsel is GRANTED and the Order will be
signed at the hearing. “After the order is signed, a copy of the signed order
must be served on the client and on all parties that have appeared in the
case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) The Order on this Motion will not
be effective “until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on Plaintiff
and Defendant has been filed with the court.” (Id.) 
 
Moving party is ordered to
give notice.
