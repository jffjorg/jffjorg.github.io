And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling to deny the ex parte application without prejudice. The application was filed by Plaintiff Adelita B Sibal, Trustee, and seeks a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent a trustee sale. However, the Court lacks sufficient evidence to support the application. The moving papers do not contain any admissible evidence, and there is no declaration from the Plaintiff herself. Additionally, there is no notice of the trustee sale to the Plaintiff or to other parties, including the alleged convicted scam artist Mr. Tikal. The Court notes that the moving party has not carried its burden of proof, and therefore, the application will be denied.
