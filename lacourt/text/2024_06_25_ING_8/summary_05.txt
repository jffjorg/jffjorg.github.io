And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers filed by Ford Motor Company and AutoNation Ford Torrance. Ford's demurrer is OVERRULED as to the "new motor vehicle" argument and SUSTAINED as to the fraudulent concealment claim. AutoNation's demurrer is SUSTAINED.

The court finds that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for fraudulent concealment against Ford because it does not plead sufficient facts to show that Ford had a duty to disclose the defects in the transmission. The court also finds that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for negligent repair against AutoNation because it does not plead sufficient facts to show that AutoNation's conduct resulted in any damages.

The court notes that the complaint alleges that Ford concealed defects in the transmission, but the court finds that this is not sufficient to state a claim for fraudulent concealment. The court also notes that the complaint alleges that AutoNation failed to properly store, prepare, and repair the vehicle, but the court finds that this is not sufficient to state a claim for negligent repair.

The court grants Ford's demurrer as to the fraudulent concealment claim and sustains AutoNation's demurrer as to the negligent repair claim. The court orders the parties to file a notice of the ruling.
