And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ordered the parties to conduct a meaningful meet and confer to resolve their disputes over discovery responses. The parties had previously propounded discovery, and the defendant served responses, but the plaintiff claims that the responses were boilerplate and failed to produce many documents. The defendant disputes the need for further responses. The judge has also ordered the parties to file a joint statement of remaining issues, which should describe the matters in dispute and the parties' arguments. The judge has not decided the motion on the merits at this time and has instead opted to have the parties work together to resolve their differences.
