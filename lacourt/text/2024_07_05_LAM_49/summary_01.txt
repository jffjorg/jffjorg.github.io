And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint is sustained. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant, Elie George Samaha, and other defendants convinced her to make improvements to her property, but failed to exercise care in making the improvements, resulting in defects that forced her to pay additional money to remedy. The judge finds that the plaintiff has failed to plead sufficient facts to support her claims against the defendant, Forward Beverly Hills, Inc., and therefore the demurrer is sustained. The judge orders the defendant to give notice, unless waived.
