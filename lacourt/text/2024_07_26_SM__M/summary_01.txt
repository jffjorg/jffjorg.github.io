And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel further responses from the defendants, Dahlia Fox and Avrohom Fox, regarding their application or receipt of rental assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic. The defendants had objected to the requests for admission, claiming that the information sought was confidential, privileged, and protected by law. However, the judge found that the defendants failed to justify their blanket objections and that the requests were relevant to the subject matter of the pending action. The judge ordered the defendants to provide further responses within 10 days and imposed sanctions of $1,010.00 against each of the defendants. The judge also noted that the motion to compel further responses was granted because the defendants had failed to provide code-compliant responses to the requests for admission.
