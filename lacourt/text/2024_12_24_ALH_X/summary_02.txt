And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants' motion for terminating sanctions, but only in part. The request for terminating sanctions is denied without prejudice, meaning the defendants can re-file the motion at a later date. However, the judge has granted the defendants' request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,500. The defendants are entitled to this amount because the plaintiffs failed to provide Code-compliant responses to discovery requests and failed to comply with previous court orders. The judge has also ordered the plaintiffs to serve the defendants with Code-compliant responses to the discovery requests within 15 days of the order.
