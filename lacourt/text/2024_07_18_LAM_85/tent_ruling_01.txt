  Case Number:  21STCV45351    Hearing Date:   July 18, 2024    Dept:  85 
Barry Ben-Ron, et al. v. Maria De Lourdes
Ruiz, 21STCV45351

 


Tentative decision on petition for
writ of attachment: granted in part




 



Barry Ben-Ron (“Ben-Ron”) and Brian Sean Costello (“Costello”)
seek a writ of attachment against Defendant Maria De Lourdes Ruiz (“Ruiz”). 
The court has read and considered the moving papers (no
opposition has been filed) and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
On December 13, 2021, Ben-Ron and Costello filed a verified Complaint
against Ruiz alleging (1) breach of written contract and (2) breach of implied contract.
The Complaint alleges in pertinent part as follows.
On or about October, 2020, Ruiz and Ben-Ron entered into a
written contract for the purchase of real property located at 212 East 24th
Street, Los Angeles (the “Property”). The contract was on a C.A.R. form
California Residential Purchase Agreement and Joint Escrow Instructions and a
Seller Multiple Counter Offer (the “Purchase Agreement”) and signed by both the
Seller Ruiz and Buyer Ben-Ron on October 10, 2020.  Compl., ¶6, Ex. 1.  
On or about October 26, 2020 Costello became a co-buyer with
Ben-Ron under the Purchase Agreement.  Compl., ¶7, Ex. 2.
As part of the purchase process, on or about October 27,
2020, Ruiz provided a C.A.R Seller Written Property Questionnaire in which she
disclosed that the Property was subject to a PACE lien and related loan.  In that same document, Ruiz promised that she
would pay the loan related to that PACE lien through escrow.  These promises became part of the terms of the
Purchase Agreement.  Compl., ¶8, Ex. 3.
Plaintiffs Ben-Ron and Costello relied upon Ruiz’s written
promise and agreement that the PACE loan and lien would be paid off in escrow,
such that the Property would be transferred to them without the lien.  As a result, Plaintiffs completed their
purchase of the Property under the Purchase Agreement.  Compl., ¶9.
Escrow closed on or about November 25, 2020, and the
Property was transferred to Plaintiffs as tenants in common by a grant deed. Compl.,
¶10, Ex. 4.  When escrow closed, the
escrow company did not pay off the PACE loan and lien on the Property, and
instead gave Ruiz the money that would have paid off the loan.  Compl., ¶11. 

Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege,
that representatives of the escrow company contacted Ruiz once the error was
discovered  and asked her to pay off the
loan, but she failed to do so.  Compl., ¶12.  Plaintiffs also contacted Ruiz in writing and
asked her to pay off the PACE loan to remove the PACE lien from the Property.  Ruiz failed to do so.  Compl., ¶13.
Ruiz has breached the Purchase Agreement by failing to have
the loan paid off at close of escrow, by transferring the Property with the
PACE lien still it, and by failing to pay off the loan after escrow closed and
the failure became known.  Compl., ¶14.
Plaintiffs have been damaged in an amount of at least
$102,987.90, or such larger amount as may be proven at trial.  Compl., ¶16.
Plaintiffs seek damages in an amount of $102,987.90 or such
larger amount as proven at trial, costs of suit, attorney fees, and such other
relief as the court deems just and proper.
 
2. The Course of Proceedings
On June 15, 2022, Ruiz filed a verified answer and a Cross-Complaint
against Cross-Defendant Ben-Ron and Costello and other parties alleging (1) fraud
in the inducement, (2) fraud, (3) promissory fraud, (4) breach of contract, and
(5) negligence.  
On April 25, 2024, the court granted One Key Escrow Corp,
Manuel Morales, and Ruby Tang’s motion to enforce the terms of a settlement entered
into with Ruiz.  The Cross-Complaint was
dismissed against all Cross-Defendants with prejudice. 
 
B. Applicable Law
Attachment is a prejudgment remedy providing for the seizure
of one or more of the defendant’s assets to aid in the collection of a money
demand pending the outcome of the trial of the action.  See Whitehouse v. Six Corporation,
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 527, 533.  In 1972,
and in a 1977 comprehensive revision, the Legislature enacted attachment
legislation (CCP §481.010 et seq.) that meets the due process
requirements set forth in Randone v. Appellate Department, (1971) 5
Cal.3d 536.  See Western Steel
& Ship Repair v. RMI, (12986) 176 Cal.App.3d 1108, 1115.  As the attachment statutes are purely the
creation of the Legislature, they are strictly construed.  Vershbow v. Reiner, (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 879, 882.
A writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a
claim or claims for money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or
implied, where the total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily
ascertainable amount not less than five hundred dollars ($500).  CCP §483.010(a).  A claim is “readily ascertainable” where the
amount due may be clearly ascertained from the contract and calculated by
evidence; the fact that damages are unliquidated is not determinative.  CIT Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v.
Super DVD, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 537, 540-41 (attachment appropriate
for claim based on rent calculation for lease of commercial equipment).
All property within California of a corporation,
association, or partnership is subject to attachment if there is a method of
levy for the property.  CCP §487.010(a),
(b).  While a trustee is a natural
person, a trust is not.  Therefore, a
trust’s property is subject to attachment on the same basis as a corporation or
partnership.  Kadison, Pfaelzer,
Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d at 4.
The plaintiff may apply for a right to attach order by
noticing a hearing for the order and serving the defendant with summons and
complaint, notice of the application, and supporting papers any time after
filing the complaint.  CCP §484.010.  Notice of the application must be given
pursuant to CCP section 1005, sixteen court days before the hearing.  See ibid.
The notice of the application and the application may be
made on Judicial Council forms (Optional Forms AT-105, 115).  The application must be supported by an
affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the facts presented would be entitled
to a judgment on the claim upon which the attachment is based.  CCP §484.030. 

If the action is against a defendant who is a natural
person, an attachment may be issued only on a commercial claim which arises out
of the defendant’s conduct of a trade, business, or profession.  CCP §483.010(c).  Consumer transactions cannot form a basis for
attachment.   CCP §483.010(c); Kadison,
Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson, (1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4
(action involving trust property was a commercial, not a consumer,
transaction).
Where the defendant is a natural person, the description of
the property must be reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify
the specific property sought to be attached. 
CCP §484.020(e).  Although the
property must be specifically described, the plaintiff may target for
attachment everything the individual defendant owns.  Bank of America v. Salinas Nissan, Inc.,
(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
A defendant who opposes issuance of the order must file and
serve a notice of opposition and supporting affidavit as required by CCP
section 484.060 not later than five court days prior to the date set for
hearing.  CCP §484.050(e).  The notice of opposition may be made on a
Judicial Council form (Optional Form AT-155). 

The plaintiff may file and serve a reply two court days
prior to the date set for the hearing. 
CCP §484.060(c). 
At the hearing, the court determines whether the plaintiff
should receive a right to attach order and whether any property which the
plaintiff seeks to attach is exempt from attachment.  The defendant may appear the hearing.  CCP §484.050(h).  The court generally will evaluate the
attachment application based solely on the pleadings and supporting affidavits
without taking additional evidence.  Bank
of America, supra, 207 Cal.App.3d at 273. A verified complaint may
be used in lieu of or in addition to an affidavit if it states evidentiary
facts.  CCP §482.040.  The plaintiff has the burden of proof, and
the court is not required to accept as true any affidavit even if it is undisputed.  See Bank of America, supra,
at 271, 273.
The court may issue a right to attach order (Optional Form
AT-120) if the plaintiff shows all of the following: (1) the claim on which the
attachment is based is one on which an attachment may be issued (CCP
§484.090(a)(1)); (2) the plaintiff has established the probable validity of the
claim (CCP §484.090(a)(2)); (3) attachment is sought for no purpose other than
the recovery on the subject claim (CCP §484.090(a)(3); and (4) the amount to be
secured by the attachment is greater than zero (CCP §484.090(a)(4)). 
A claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than
not that the plaintiff will recover on that claim.  CCP §481.190. 
In determining this issue, the court must consider the relative merits
of the positions of the respective parties. 
Kemp Bros. Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146
Cal.App.4th 1474, 1484.  The court does
not determine whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be
made at trial and is not affected by the decision on the application for the
order.  CCP §484.050(b).
The amount to be secured by the attachment is the sum of (1)
the amount of the defendant’s indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff, and (2)
any additional amount included by the court for estimate of costs and any
allowable attorneys’ fees under CCP section 482.110.  CCP §483.015(a); Goldstein v. Barak
Construction, (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 845, 852.  This amount must be reduced by the sum of (1)
the amount of indebtedness that the defendant has in a money judgment against
plaintiff, (2) the amount claimed in a cross-complaint or affirmative defense
and shown would be subject to attachment against the plaintiff, and (3) the
value of any security interest held by the plaintiff in the defendant’s
property, together with the amount by which the acts of the plaintiff (or a
prior holder of the security interest) have decreased that security interest’s
value.  CCP §483.015(b).   A defendant claiming that the amount to be
secured should be reduced because of a cross-claim or affirmative defense must
make a prima facie showing that the claim would result in an attachment
against the plaintiff.
Before the issuance of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff
is required to file an undertaking to pay the defendant any amount the
defendant may recover for any wrongful attachment by the plaintiff in the
action.  CCP §489.210.  The undertaking ordinarily is $10,000. CCP
§489.220.  If the defendant objects, the
court may increase the amount of undertaking to the amount determined as the
probable recovery for wrongful attachment. 
CCP §489.220.  The court also has
inherent authority to increase the amount of the undertaking sua sponte.  North Hollywood Marble Co. v. Superior
Court, (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 683, 691.
 
C. Analysis
Plaintiffs seek a
right to attach order against Ruiz for $162,167.58.  No opposition is on file.
While Plaintiffs
filed a notice, an application for right to attach, and a supporting
memorandum, they failed to file their evidence (even though they provided a
courtesy copy).  They may, however, rely
on their verified Complaint as evidence.  People v. Superior Court, (1989) 207
Cal.App.3d 464, 469.  
 
1. A Claim Based
on a Contract and on Which Attachment May Be Based
            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
CCP §483.010(a).  
Plaintiffs’ claim is
based on the Purchase Agreement.  On
or about October, 2020, Ruiz and Ben-Ron entered into the Purchase Agreement to
purchase the Property.  The contract was
on a C.A.R. form California Residential Purchase Agreement and Joint Escrow
Instructions and a Seller Multiple Counter Offer (the “Purchase Agreement”) and
signed by both the Seller Ruiz and Buyer Ben-Ron on October 10, 2020.  Compl., ¶6, Ex. 1.  On or about October 26, 2020 Costello became
a co-buyer with Ben-Ron under the Purchase Agreement.  Compl., ¶7, Ex. 2.  Ruiz breached the Purchase Agreement, and the
claim exceeds $500.  This is a claim on
which attachment may be based.
 
2. An Amount Due
That is Fixed and Readily Ascertainable 
            A
claim is “readily ascertainable” where the damages may be readily ascertained
by reference to the contract and the basis of the calculation appears to be
reasonable and definite.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th
537, 540-41.  The fact that the damages
are unliquidated is not determinative.  Id.  But the contract must furnish a standard by
which the amount may be ascertained and there must be a basis by which the
damages can be determined by proof.  Id.
(citations omitted).
As part of the purchase process, on or about October 27,
2020, Ruiz provided a C.A.R Seller Written Property Questionnaire in which she
disclosed that the Property was subject to a PACE lien and related loan.  In that same document, Ruiz promised that she
would pay the loan related to that PACE lien through escrow.  These promises became part of the terms of
the Purchase Agreement.  Compl., ¶8, Ex.
3.
Escrow closed on or about November 25, 2020, and the
Property was transferred to Plaintiffs as tenants in common by a grant deed.
Compl., ¶10, Ex. 4.  When escrow closed,
the escrow company did not pay off the PACE loan and lien on the Property, and
instead gave Ruiz the money that would have paid off the loan.  Compl., ¶11. 

Plaintiffs contacted Ruiz in writing and asked her to pay
off the PACE loan to remove the PACE lien from the Property.  Ruiz failed to do so.  Compl., ¶13.
Ruiz has breached the
Purchase Agreement by failing to have the loan paid off during close of escrow,
by transferring the Property with the PACE lien still it, and by failing to pay
off the loan after escrow closed and the failure became known.  Compl., ¶14. 
Plaintiffs have been damaged in an amount of at least $102,987.90, or
such larger amount as may be proven at trial. 
Compl., ¶16.  These damages at
least arguably are readily ascertainable.
Plaintiffs also
claim $28,680 in attorney fees and $3,875 in costs incurred to date, and an
estimated additional attorney fees of $30,000 through trial.  Mem. at 3. 
None of these fees and costs is supported by evidence and they are
disallowed.
            
            3.
Probability of Success
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim. 
CCP §481.190.  In determining this
issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros.
Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474,
1484.  The court does not determine
whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial
and is not affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
            The facts showing the Purchase
Agreement, Plaintiffs’ performance, and Ruiz’s breach show a probability of
success on the merits.
 
4, Attachment Based on Commercial Claim
            If
the action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a commercial claim which arises out of the defendant’s conduct
of a trade, business, or profession.  CCP
§483.010(c).  Consumer transactions
cannot form a basis for attachment.   CCP
§483.010(c); Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson,
(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 (action involving trust property was a commercial,
not a consumer, transaction).
            Plaintiffs
contend that Ruiz was a landlord and owner of a rental duplex which they
purchased.  Mem. at 7.  The Purchase Agreement in the verified
Complaint states that the unit is occupied by tenants.  Compl., Ex. 1 (last page).  The transaction is commercial in nature and arise
out of Ruiz’s conduct of a business.
 
            5.
Attachment Sought for a Proper Purpose 
            Attachment
must not be sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon
which attachment is based.  CCP §484.090(a)(3).  Plaintiffs seek
attachment for a proper purpose.
 
            6.
Description of Property to be Attached
            Where
the defendant is a natural person, the description of the property must be
reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify the specific property
sought to be attached.  CCP §484.020(e).  Although the property must be specifically
described, the plaintiff may target for attachment everything the individual
defendant owns.  Bank of America v.
Salinas Nissan, Inc., (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268. The requirement of
specificity avoids unnecessary hearings where an individual defendant is
willing to concede that the described property is subject to attachment.  Ibid. 
A general list of categories - e.g., “real property, personal
property, equipment, motor vehicles, chattel paper, negotiable and other
instruments, securities, deposit accounts, safe-deposit boxes, accounts
receivable, general intangibles, property subject to pending actions, final
money judgments, and personal property in decedents’ estates” – is
sufficient.  Ibid. 
            Plaintiffs
seek to attach a specific real property owned by Ruiz at 849 East 41st
Street, Los Angeles.  This is an adequate
description of property to be attached.
 
            E. Conclusion
            The
application for a right to attach order is granted in the amount of $102,987.90.
