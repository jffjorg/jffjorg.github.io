[1] This
motion is scheduled to be heard on October 22, 2024. Absent objection from the
parties, the Court advances and vacates the hearing to hear the motion in
conjunction with the motion to strike.


[2] The
motion to which this motion refers has been taken off calendar by the
Defendant, and therefore the motion to strike is moot.
