And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the Judge regarding a motion to continue the trial, including expert discovery deadlines, in a case involving Alfonso Herrera, the Plaintiff, and Knight Transportation, Inc., the Defendant. The Defendant seeks a continuance to permit the Plaintiff time to recover from medically necessary surgeries and allow the parties' medical experts to offer final opinions upon the Plaintiff's recovery. The Defendant's counsel will be taking maternity leave for approximately 3.5 months and will be unable to attend trial until January 1, 2025.

The Judge has granted the motion to continue the trial, but not for the length of time requested. The trial date, currently set for November 6, 2024, is continued to January 30, 2025. The Final Status Conference, currently set for October 22, 2024, is continued to January 16, 2025. Expert discovery deadlines only will be associated with the new trial date, and fact discovery will remain closed unless otherwise stipulated by the parties.

The Judge notes that the parties' stipulation to continue the trial was denied previously because it did not set forth with specificity sufficient good cause to justify the request to continue to April 25, 2025. The Judge also notes that the Defendant's motion to continue the trial repeats arguments made in the stipulation and ex parte application, which the Court previously found were not sufficient to justify the length of continuance requested.

The Judge has granted the motion in part, but has denied the request for a continuance to April 25, 2025. The Judge has ordered that there shall be no further request for continuance.
