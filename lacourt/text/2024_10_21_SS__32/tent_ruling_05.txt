MOTION
 
Defendant Home Delivery Link, Inc. (“Defendant”) moves to continue
trial.[1]
Plaintiff Victor Manuel Leon, Jr. (“Plaintiff”) opposes and Defendant replies.  
 
Separately, Plaintiff moves to strike Defendant’s Amended Notice of
Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment.[2]
 
BACKGROUND
 
On May 27, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant
La-Z-Boy, Inc. and Does 1 to 50. Trial was initially set for November 27, 2023.

 
On September 8, 2022, La-Z-Boy, Inc. filed a cross-complaint against,
among others, Home Delivery Link, Inc. and 
 
On May 4, 2023, the parties stipulated to allow Plaintiff to file a
first amended complaint (“FAC”). 
 
On September 1, 2023, pursuant to stipulation, the Court continued trial
and all related dates to May 28, 2024. 
 
On February 14, 2024, pursuant to stipulation, the Court granted leave
for Plaintiff to file a second amended complaint (“SAC”). The SAC was filed on
February 16, 2024 and names Defendant. 
 
On April 2, 2024, pursuant to stipulation, the Court continued trial
and all related dates to November 4, 2024. 
 
On April 14, 2024, the Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to the SAC
with leave to amend. 
 
On May 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed a third amended complaint (“TAC”). 
 
On June 5, 2024, Defendant filed an answer to the TAC and a
cross-complaint against On 2 the Next Logistix, LLC. 
 
On July 17, 2024, Defendant filed and served via electronic notice, two
motions for summary judgment: one against Plaintiff’s TAC, and the other on its
own cross-complaint against On 2 the Next Logistix, LLC. Trial was set for
November 4, 2024 at this time. 
 
On September 5, 2024, pursuant to stipulation, the Court continued
trial and all related dates to February 5, 2025. 
 
Therefore, there have been three prior continuances in this case. The
motions for summary judgment are scheduled for June 5, 2025 and June 6, 2025. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Legal Standard
 
 “Continuances are
granted only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring a
continuance.”  (In re Marriage of Falcone & Fyke (2008) 164
Cal.App.4th 814, 823.)  A trial court has broad discretion in considering
a request for a trial continuance.  (Pham v. Nguyen (1997) 54
Cal.App.4th 11, 13-18.)  California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332 sets forth
factors for the Court to consider in ruling on a motion to continue
trial. 
 
“To ensure the prompt disposition of civil cases, the
dates assigned for a trial are firm. All parties and their counsel must regard
the date set for trial as certain.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(a).) 
 
“A party seeking a continuance of the date set for trial,
whether contested or uncontested or stipulated to by the parties, must make the
request for a continuance by a noticed motion or an ex parte application under
the rules in chapter 4 of this division, with supporting declarations. The
party must make the motion or application as soon as reasonably practical once
the necessity for the continuance is discovered.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(b).)
 
“Although continuances of trials are disfavored, each
request for a continuance must be considered on its own merits. The court may
grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the
continuance. Circumstances that may indicate good cause include:
 
(1)   The unavailability of an essential lay
or expert witness because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;
(2)   The unavailability of a party because
of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;
(3)   The unavailability of trial counsel
because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances; 
(4)   The substitution of trial counsel, but
only where there is an affirmative showing that the substitution is required in
the interests of justice;
(5)   The addition of a new party if:
(A) The new party has not had a reasonable
opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial; or
(B) The other parties have not had a
reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard to
the new party’s involvement in the case;
(6)   A party’s excused inability to obtain
essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent
efforts; or
(7)   A significant, unanticipated change in
the status of the case as a result of which the case is not ready for trial.” 
(Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1332(c).)
 
“In ruling on a motion or application for continuance,
the court must consider all the facts and circumstances that are relevant to
the determination. These may include:
 
(1)   The proximity of the trial date;
(2)   Whether there was any previous
continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party;
(3)   The length of the continuance
requested;
(4)   The availability of alternative means
to address the problem that gave rise to the motion or application for a
continuance;
(5)   The prejudice that parties or
witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;
(6)   If the case is entitled to a
preferential trial setting, the reasons for that status and whether the need
for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay;
(7)   The court’s calendar and the impact of
granting a continuance on other pending trials;
(8)   Whether trial counsel is engaged in
another trial;
(9)   Whether all parties have stipulated to
a continuance;
(10)  Whether the interests of justice are
best served by a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by imposing
conditions on the continuance; and
(11)  Any other fact or circumstance
relevant to the fair determination of the motion or application.
(Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1332(d).)
 
A party may move for summary judgment “at any time after 60
days have elapsed since the general appearance in the action or proceeding of
each party against whom the motion is directed or at any earlier time after the
general appearance that the court, with or without notice and upon good cause
shown, may direct.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (a)(1).)¿ Notice of the
motion and supporting papers must be served on all other parties at least 75
days before the time appointed for hearing.¿ (Id., subd. (a)(2).)¿ The
motion must be heard no later than 30 days before the date of trial, unless the
court for good cause orders otherwise.¿ (Id., subd. (a)(3).)¿¿¿ 
 
“The importance of providing the minimum statutory notice
of a summary judgment hearing cannot be overemphasized.”¿ (Robinson v. Woods
(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1262 (Robinson).)¿ “Because it is
potentially case dispositive and usually requires considerable time and effort
to prepare, a summary judgment motion is perhaps the most important pretrial
motion in a civil case.”¿ (Ibid.)¿ “Therefore, the Legislature was
entitled to conclude that parties should be afforded a minimum notice period
for the hearing of summary judgment motions so that they have sufficient time
to assemble the relevant evidence and prepare an adequate opposition.”¿ (Ibid.)¿
Thus, without the parties’ consent, “in light of the express statutory
language, trial courts do not have authority to shorten the minimum notice
period for summary judgment hearings.”¿ (Ibid.)¿¿¿ 
 
Discussion
 
In
September 2024, the parties stipulated to continue trial to February 2025 to accommodate
a mediation scheduled on October 10, 2024. Defendant asserts it reserved the
right to ask the court for a continuance or advance its hearing dates. 
 
On
September 10, 2024, Defendant found earlier summary judgment hearing dates, and
reserved them for October 24, 2024 and October 29, 2024. On September 17, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a motion to strike the amended notices (heard concurrently with
this motion), arguing they provided insufficient notice. Nevertheless, it
appears the October 2024 hearing dates are no longer on calendar, and the Court
notes that only the June 2025 dates remain. Accordingly, the motion to strike
appears to be moot.
 
Defendant requests the Court continue trial in this case to at least
30 days after the scheduled June 5, 2025 and June 6, 2025 summary judgment
hearings. A
party that timely files a motion for summary judgment under Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c has a right to have their motion heard before the start
of trial. (Cole v. Superior Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.) If served electronically, a motion for
summary judgment must be made at least 105 days before trial, plus two court
days. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(a)(2), (3).) Therefore, based on the trial date at the time the motions
were served on July 17, 2024 (trial date November 4, 2024) a motion for
summary judgment in this case needed to be filed by July 18, 2024. 
 
 Defendant timely served/filed
its motions for summary judgment on July 17, 2024. Defendant argues the
earliest dates available for a summary judgment hearing were June 5, 2025 and
June 6, 2025. (Gagas Decl. ¶ 10.) Since that date is after trial, Defendant
requests that the Court continue the trial date to allow for the motions for
summary judgment to be heard. 
 
In
opposition, Plaintiff argues Defendant has not shown sufficient good cause and states
he will be prejudiced by the continuance. Plaintiff also mentions the two ex
parte applications that were denied. However, in those, the Court did not
address the merits but instead found that Defendant has not met the initial
standard for seeking ex parte relief. (Min. Order, 3/21/24, 8/22/24.) On March
21, 2024, the Court found no exigency as the parties had filed a stipulation.
The Court further noted that the parties should submit a new stipulation and
proposed order addressing the deficiencies rather than seek relief on an ex
parte basis. (Min. Order 3/21/24.) Moreover, on August 22, 2024, the Court
indicated that the parties should first attempt to reach a stipulation and file
a joint stipulation and proposed order to continue the trial date to a date
after any timely filed motion for summary judgment. (Min. Order 8/22/24.) 
 
Here,
the record shows that Defendant first filed an answer on June 5, 2024 after
successfully demurring to Plaintiff’s SAC. The fact that it served and filed
its motions for summary judgment on July 17, 2024 shows it acted diligently.
Additionally, because they were timely filed based on the then-trial date, the
Court finds good cause to continue trial. Any prejudice that Plaintiff may experience
based on the continuance is outweighed by Defendant’s right to have the summary
judgment motions heard. 
 
Accordingly,
the Court grants the motion to continue trial. 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to continue trial.
 
The Final Status Conference is continued to June 23, 2025 at 10:00
a.m. in Department 32 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
 
Trial is continued to July 7, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 32 of
the Spring Street Courthouse.
 
All
discovery and pre-trial motion cut-off dates shall be in accordance with the
new trial date.  
 
 
Defendant shall give notice of this order, and file a proof of service
of such.
