And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has tentatively denied the defendants' motion to consolidate three cases (20STCV48811, 20STCV48002, and 21STCV16214) for all purposes. The motion was denied because the cases have not been deemed related and are not pending in the same department, as required by the Local Court Rules. The Court's denial of the motion is based on its discretion to avoid unnecessary costs or delay, duplication of procedure, and inconsistent results. The Court considers several factors when deciding whether to consolidate cases, including timeliness, complexity, and prejudice. In this case, the Court found that the motion was untimely and that consolidation would not be beneficial.
