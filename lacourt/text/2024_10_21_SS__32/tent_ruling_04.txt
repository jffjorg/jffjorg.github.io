BACKGROUND
 
            Defendant Downey GAS’N’GO, INC (“Defendant”)
moves to compel Plaintiff Alonso Ramiro (“Plaintiff”) to serve verified
responses, without objections, to Demand for Production of Documents, Set One, Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set One. Defendant also seeks
monetary sanctions. No oppositions have been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Interrogatories
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a
timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290 (b).) Failure to timely respond waives
all objections, including privilege and work product, unless “[t]he party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance” and “[t]he
party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290 (a)(1),
(a)(2).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no
responses have been served and no meet and confer is required when a party does
not respond to discovery requests. All that need be shown in the moving papers
is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party,
that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been
served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.) 
 
If a motion to compel responses is filed, the Court shall impose a
monetary sanction against the losing party “unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290 (c).) Further, “[t]he court may award sanctions under the Discovery
Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).)
 
Requests
for Production
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure Section 2031.300, if a party fails to
serve a timely response to a demand for inspection, the party making the demand
may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Code Civ. Pro §
2031.300 (b).) The party who fails to serve a timely response to a demand for
inspection waives any objection to the demand unless the court finds that the
party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance or
party’s failure was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300 (a)(1)- (2).) 
 
Courts shall impose a monetary sanction against any party who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for
inspection unless the party acted with substantial justification or other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.300 (c).) Further, “[t]he court may award sanctions under the Discovery
Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).)
 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            As a preliminary matter, the Court
notes the Motion to Compel Responses for the Form Interrogatories, Set One is
improperly combined with a Motion to Compel Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One. 
 
Here, Defendant served Demand for Production of Documents, Set One, Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set One on Plaintiff on February
21, 2024. (Germany Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. A; Germany Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. A.) Plaintiff
received three extensions to respond to these discovery requests and to this
date has not responded. (Id. at ¶ 3; Exh. B.) Therefore, because
responses have not been served, the motions to compel are granted. 
 
Defendant also
requests $1,110.00 total in monetary sanctions for two motions, against
Plaintiff and his counsel of record. This represents an hourly rate of $165 and
the $60 filing fee. (Id. at ¶¶ 5- 6.) The Court finds sanctions are
warranted because Plaintiff has failed to respond, however, the amount
requested is excessive given the type of motion, they are nearly identical, the
lack of opposition, and the fact counsel can appear at the hearing remotely. Therefore, the
Court awards sanctions in the total amount of $555.00 (1.5 hours of attorney
time to draft the motions and appear at the hearing, plus the filing fee, for two
motions). 
             
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Plaintiff is ordered to pay the Court the filing fee for the
improperly combined Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set
One prior to the hearing. 
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Motions to Compel Demand for Production of
Documents, Set One, Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Special Interrogatories,
Set One are GRANTED. Plaintiff Ramiro shall provide verified responses, without
objection, within 20 days.
 
The Court further GRANTS Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions
against Plaintiff and his attorney of record, jointly and severally, in the reduced
amount of $555.00
total. Said monetary sanctions are to be paid to counsel for Defendant
within 30 days of the date of this order.
 
Defendant
shall provide notice of the Court’s order and file a proof of service of such.
