And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Plaintiff's Counsel, Igor Fradkin, to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Gustavo Meneses-Gomez. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and communications. However, the judge denied the motion because it was procedurally defective, as no proof of service was provided, and the proposed order was incomplete. The judge also found that the proposed order did not list all dates in the case. The judge ruled that Counsel shall provide notice of the Court's ruling and file proofs of service.
