And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Maria Alarcon v. Costco Wholesale Corporation. The plaintiff, Maria Alarcon, filed a complaint against Costco alleging that she suffered a slip and fall at one of its stores and seeks damages. The defendant, Costco, answered the complaint and moved to exclude any expert witnesses called by the plaintiff at trial. The judge granted the motion, finding that the plaintiff failed to comply with discovery requirements, including providing information about its expert witnesses. The judge also noted that the plaintiff failed to file a witness list, which made it impossible for the defendant to prepare for trial. The judge ruled that the plaintiff may not call any expert witnesses at trial, including treating physicians who may have evaluated causation. The judge also noted that the plaintiff may testify to her injuries at trial, but it is unclear whether that will be sufficient to establish causation.
