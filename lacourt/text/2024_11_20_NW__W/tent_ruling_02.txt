[Tentative] Ruling
 
Plaintiff Kelsi Smith’s Motion for
Order Deeming Admitted Truth of Facts is GRANTED. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff
Kelsi Smith moves this court for an order compelling that the truth of all
specified matters in Plaintiff’s Request for Admissions, Set One served on
Defendant AMFP V ETON WARNER, LCC on June 11, 2024 is deemed admitted as well
as for an order imposing monetary sanctions against Defendant and their defense
counsel, jointly and severally, in the sum of $1,635.00.  
 
Where there
has been no timely response to a request for admission under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an order that
the truth of any matters specified in the requests and the genuineness of any
documents be deemed admitted, as well as a monetary sanction. (CCP
§2033.280(b).) The party who failed to respond waives any objections to the
demand, unless the court grants that party relief from the waiver, upon a
showing that the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially compliant
response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result of
mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. (CCP §2033.280(a)(1)-(2).) The
court shall grant the motion “unless it finds that the party to whom the
requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the
motion, a proposed response … in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”
(CCP §2033.280(c); St. Mary v. Sup. Ct. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762,
777-78.)
 
On June 11, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel propounded Plaintiff’s Request
for Admissions, Set One on Defendant. (Jensen Decl. ¶2, Exh. A.) Defendant’s responses
were due on or before July 15, 2024. (Jensen Decl. ¶3.) On July 25, 2024,
Plaintiff’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter regarding the delinquent
responses and Defendant’s waiver of objections. (Jensen Decl. ¶4, Exh. B.)
Defense counsel acknowledged the missing deadline and responded he would look
into the matter. (Jensen Decl. ¶5, Exh. C.) Defense counsel later responded
stating the volume of requests was extensive and if Plaintiff could agree to
“taper down the requests”. (Jensen Decl. ¶6, Exh. C.) Plaintiff’s counsel
agreed to the request; however, no responses were provided. (Jensen Decl.
¶¶7-8, Exh. D.) Counsel went back and forth a few more times regarding the
discovery, but as of the date of the motion, Defendant has not provided any
responses. (Jensen Decl. ¶¶3, 7-12, Exhs. D-F.) 
 
As such, Plaintiff’s unopposed
motion for an order deeming admitted truth of facts in Plaintiff’s request for
admissions is GRANTED. Defendant is ordered to produce the verified discovery
responses without objection in ten days.
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $1,635.00. 
 
If a propounding party moves for and
obtains a court order compelling a response, the court shall impose monetary
sanctions against the party failing to timely respond to interrogatories and
demands for inspection unless that party acted with substantial justification
or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (CCP §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c),
2033.280(c); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148
Cal.App.4th at 404.) 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel contends they spent
approximately 1.5 hours preparing the motion, anticipate spending another hour
reviewing the opposition and another hour appearing at the hearing per motion. (Jensen
Decl. ¶14.) Counsel’s hourly rate of $450.00 (Jensen Decl. ¶14.) Counsel also
seeks $60.00 for filing fees per motion. (Jensen Decl. ¶14.) 
 
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED, in the reduced
amount of $510.00.
