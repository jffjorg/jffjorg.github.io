And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants, Martinian & Associates, et al, to the second amended complaint filed by the plaintiff, Margarita Carranza. The demurrer was filed to challenge the sufficiency of the pleadings and to request that the court dismiss the complaint.

The court has overruled the demurrer, finding that the allegations in the second amended complaint are sufficient to state a claim for fraud. The court has also ordered the defendants to answer the second amended complaint within 10 days.

The court has declined to address certain non-identified causes of action and improperly noticed extrinsic items. The court has also declined to consider the arguments regarding the original complaint, finding that they lack a nexus with the operative pleading under challenge.

The court's ruling is based on the principles of liberal construction of pleadings and the requirement that pleadings be liberally construed to determine their effect. The court has also considered the purpose of a demurrer, which is to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading by raising questions of law.

The court's tentative ruling is subject to change based on any further submissions or arguments made by the parties.
