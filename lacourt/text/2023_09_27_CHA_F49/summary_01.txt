The court has overruled the demurrer, finding that the allegations in the second amended complaint are sufficient to state a claim for fraud. The court has also ordered the defendants to answer the second amended complaint within 10 days.

The court has declined to address certain non-identified causes of action and improperly noticed extrinsic items. The court has also declined to consider the arguments regarding the original complaint, finding that they lack a nexus with the operative pleading under challenge.

The court's ruling is based on the principles of liberal construction of pleadings and the requirement that pleadings be liberally construed to determine their effect. The court has also considered the purpose of a demurrer, which is to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading by raising questions of law.

The court's tentative ruling is subject to change based on any further submissions or arguments made by the parties.

significant\_statements:
  - "A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice."
  - "In the construction of a pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties."
  - "The court 'treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.' "
  - "Again, as addressed in the summary of the demurrer to the first amended complaint, the court only sustained the demurrer to the breach of contract cause of action, and found the negligence and fraud claims were unchallenged. Defendants elected to forego challenging the subject claims. The subject demurrer therefore constitutes an improper successive demurrer."

Summary:
The tentative ruling is for a case numbered 22CHCV00801, scheduled for a hearing on September 27, 2023, in Dept F-49. The case involves the plaintiff, Margarita Carranza, and defendants, including Martinian & Associates, Robert Yaspan, Brian Kuhn, Fennia Hakobyan, Sevana Vatazarian, Philip Craft, Ronald Whittaker, Jonathan Berger, and D.A.
