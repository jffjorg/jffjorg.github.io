And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court is considering a motion to tax the costs filed by Road Runner Land & Homes, LLC, which seeks $1,022.04 in costs and $20,000 in attorney fees. The plaintiff, Dewelt, LLC, argues that a party in pro per cannot recover fees and costs on behalf of a corporate entity. The Court notes that the memorandum of costs was filed on May 26, 2023, and the motion to tax was filed on June 2, 2023, which is timely. The Court also notes that the appellate court only awarded costs to Road Runner Land & Homes, LLC, but a prevailing party may still seek attorney fees as an item of costs. However, the Court finds that Dorene Robinson, the pro per representative of Road Runner Land & Homes, LLC, may not appear on behalf of the corporation without counsel. Therefore, the motion to tax is granted.
