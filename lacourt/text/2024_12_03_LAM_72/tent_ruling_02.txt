Background
 
            On May 23, 2023, Plaintiffs Jacqueline Artola; Jaime
Aguirre Alarcon; Samuel Joshua Aguirre, a minor, by and through his
Guardian ad Litem, Jacqueline Artola; Gualberto Castro Montoya; Maria Isabel
Varga Castanaza; Sebastian Castro-Vargas, a minor, by and through his
Guardian ad Litem, Maria Isabel Vargas Castanaza; Edgar Amilcar Pimentel; Ana
Gabriela Porres De Pimentel; and Edgar Roberto Pimentel (“Plaintiffs”)
commenced this habitability action. 
 
            The
operative complaint is the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) filed on August 3,
2023 against Defendant 596 New Hampshire LLC (“Defendant”) and DOES 1 to 100,
inclusive, alleging causes of action for: (1) Violation of Civil Code § 1942.4;
(2) Tortious Breach of the Warranty of Habitability; (3) Private Nuisance; (4)
Business & Professions Code § 17200 et seq; (5) Negligence; and (6) Los
Angeles Municipal Code § 45.33.
 
            The
FAC alleges the Plaintiffs suffered uninhabitable, substandard housing
conditions in the building and their respective rental units owned by
Defendant. (FAC ¶¶1, 3-7.) The FAC further alleges despite multiple
inspections, notices, and orders from the Housing Department, Defendant failed
to abate the uninhabitable conditions. (Id. at ¶¶15-18.)
 
            On
October 10, 2023, Defendant filed its Answer. 
 
            On
September 13, 2024, Plaintiff Artola filed a Notice of Settlement. 
 
            On
October 30, 2024, Plaintiff Maria Isabel Varga Castanaza filed the instant
Petition to Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim (Sebastian Castro-Vargas, Age: 16). The petition is unopposed. 
 
 
 
Legal Standard
 
             “A parent having the right to compromise the
disputed claim of the minor under this section may execute a full release and
satisfaction, or execute a covenant not to sue on or a covenant not to enforce
judgment on the disputed claim, after the money or other property to be paid or
delivered has been paid or delivered as provided in subdivision (c). If the
court orders that all or any part of the money to be paid under the compromise
or covenant be deposited in an insured account in a financial institution in
this state, or in a single-premium deferred annuity, the release and
satisfaction or covenant is not effective for any purpose until the money has
been deposited as directed in the order of the court.” (Prob. Code, §
3500(d).) 
 
“The court shall schedule a hearing on a
petition for compromise of a minor’s disputed claim pursuant to Section 3500
within 30 days from the date of filing. If the petition is unopposed, the court
shall issue a decision on the petition at the conclusion of the hearing.”
(Prob. Code, § 3505.) 
 
“The court making the order or giving the
judgment referred to in Section 3600, as a part thereof, shall make a further
order authorizing and directing that reasonable expenses, medical or otherwise
and including reimbursement to a parent, guardian, or conservator, costs, and
attorney’s fees, as the court shall approve and allow therein, shall be paid
from the money or other property to be paid or delivered for the benefit of the
minor or person with a disability.” (Prob. Code, § 3601(a).) 
 
 
 
Discussion
 
            Claimant
Sebastian Castro-Vargas (“Claimant”), a minor by and through his Guardian ad
Litem, Maria Isabel Vargas Castanaza (“Petitioner”), has agreed to settle his
claims against Defendant 596 New Hampshire LLC in exchange for $50,000.00. If
approved, $12,500.00 will be used for attorney’s fees, representing 25% of the
recovery.  This leaves a balance of
$37,500.00 for Claimant to be invested in a single-premium deferred annuity,
subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the court. 
            The Court has reviewed
the proposed settlement and finds that it is fair and reasonable. Neither costs
nor medical expenses are expected to be paid from the gross settlement amount.
Further, the requested attorney’s fees is 25 percent of the gross settlement
amount. (See Attach. 8b(2), 18b(3).)
            Accordingly, the
Petition to Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim (Sebastian Castro-Vargas, Age: 16) is GRANTED.
