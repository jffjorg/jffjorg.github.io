TENTATIVE RULING
 



SUNWOO LEE, et al., 
 
                                  Plaintiffs,
  
         v.
 
 
COM2US
  HOLDINGS, et al.,
 
                                  Defendants.
 


 Case No:  23STCV10395
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 3, 2024
 Calendar Number: 5



 
 
Defendants Com2us USA, Inc. and
Kyu Chang Lee move to strike portions of Plaintiffs’ third amended complaint.
 
The Court grants the motion in its
entirety, except as to paragraph 22 of the TAC, which introduces no new facts
or theories of relief.
 
Plaintiffs are ordered to file within
ten (10) days of this order an operative fourth amended complaint that conforms
to the terms of the Court’s August 16, 2024 order and this order. Subsequent to
that filing, Plaintiffs may seek leave to amend via properly noticed motion.
 
 
Background
 
            This
is a securities fraud action. Plaintiffs Sunwoo Lee and Myunga Cho (“Plaintiffs”)
sued defendants Com2us Holdings, Com2us Corp., Com2us USA, Inc., and Kyu Chang
Lee on May 9, 2023. Plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint on July 11, 2023
and a second amended complaint on October 17, 2023. On April 2, 2024,
defendants Com2us USA, Inc. and Kyu Chang Lee (“Defendants”) demurred to
Plaintiffs’ second amended complaint. On August 16, 2024, the Court sustained
Defendants’ demurrer in part and granted leave to amend.
 
            On
September 5, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their operative third amended complaint
(“TAC”). On October 8, 2024, Defendants moved to strike portions of the TAC.
Defendants argue Plaintiffs amended their complaint in a manner that falls
outside the scope of the leave the Court allowed them on August 16, 2024.
 
            On November
18, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their opposition.
 
            On November
22, 2024, Defendants replied.
 
Legal Standard
 
“The court may,
upon a motion made pursuant to Section 435 [notice of motion to strike whole or
part of complaint], or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems
proper: (a) Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in
any pleading.” (Id. § 436 (a).) Irrelevant matters include immaterial
allegations that are not essential to the claim or those not pertinent to or
supported by an otherwise sufficient claim. (Id., § 431.10.) The court
may also “[s]trike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the
court.” (Id. § 436 (b).)
 
Motions to strike
are used to reach defects or objections to pleadings that are not challengeable
by demurrer, such as words, phrases, and prayers for damages. (See Code Civ.
Proc. §§ 435, 436, and 437.) The proper procedure to attack false allegations in
a pleading is a motion to strike. (Id. § 436 (a).) 
 
Meeting and Conference
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 435.5 requires a party
moving to strike to meet and confer with its opponent prior to filing.
Defendants’ counsel filed a declaration that satisfies section 435.5. (See
Huggins Decl., ¶ 3.)
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiffs’ TAC is not drawn in conformity with the
Court’s August 16, 2024 Order.
 
Defendants argue Plaintiffs’ TAC
exceeds the leave to amend that the Court granted in its order sustaining
Defendants’ demurrer on August 16, 2024. The Court agrees.
 
On August 16, 2024, the Court
heard Defendants’ demurrer to all of the causes of action in Plaintiffs’
then-operative second amended complaint. Those causes of action included (1-3)
violations of federal securities laws, (4-7) violations of California’s
Corporations Code, (8-9) intentional and negligent misrepresentation, and (10)
conversion.
 
The Court overruled Defendants’
demurrer to all claims except the federal securities claims, to which the Court
sustained the demurrer with leave to amend (while expressing doubt that those
claims could be successfully cured).
 
“Following an order sustaining a
demurrer . . . with leave to amend, the plaintiff may amend his or her
complaint only as authorized by the court’s order.” (Harris v.
Wachovia Mortg., FSB (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1018, 1023.) “[S]uch granting
of leave to amend must be construed as permission to the pleader to amend the
cause of action which he pleaded in the pleading to which the demurrer has been
sustained.” (People By and Through Dept. of Public Works v. Clausen (1967)
248 Cal.App.2d 770, 785.)
 
Plaintiffs filed their TAC on
September 5, 2024. The TAC omits Plaintiffs’ claims under federal law. However,
it adds eleven new paragraphs of facts (TAC, ¶¶ 77-87) under the subheading
“COM2US HOLDINGS’ 2022 and 2023 Annual Report,” then introduces a new third
cause of action for violation of sections 25402 and 25502.5 of the Corporations
Code. This claim did not appear in prior iterations of the pleadings.
 
Plaintiffs concede they added
material outside the scope of the Court’s leave, but argue the expansion of
their pleading is proper because “the action is still in the early pleading
stages.” (Opp., 1:9.) 
 
Plaintiffs’ argument lacks
merit.  Plaintiffs have already amended
their complaint twice. The law does not permit them to amend their complaint
freely upon each demurrer. They must seek leave to amend via properly noticed
motion and meet the relevant standard.
