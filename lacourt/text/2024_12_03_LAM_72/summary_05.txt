Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively denied Defendant Hyundai Motor America's motion to compel Plaintiffs Brad Lee and Kathy Louise Breckenridge to arbitrate their claims. The Plaintiffs had brought a Lemon Law action against Defendant, alleging that the 2024 Hyundai Tucson they purchased exhibited substantial defects that could not be repaired after a reasonable number of attempts. Defendant had argued that the Plaintiffs were bound by an arbitration agreement contained in the Owner's Handbook and Warranty Information and the Bluelink Connected Services Agreement. However, the court found that Defendant had failed to establish that the Plaintiffs had agreed to the terms of these agreements, and that the arbitration provisions did not apply to the Plaintiffs' claims. The court has requested that the Plaintiffs address Defendant's reply argument at the hearing scheduled for December 3, 2024.
