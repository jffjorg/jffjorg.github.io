And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the motion to strike portions of the third amended complaint filed by the plaintiffs, except for paragraph 22, which introduces no new facts or theories of relief. The court orders the plaintiffs to file an operative fourth amended complaint within ten days of this order. The court agrees with the defendants that the plaintiffs' third amended complaint exceeds the leave to amend granted in the court's order sustaining the defendants' demurrer on August 16, 2024. The court finds that the plaintiffs have already amended their complaint twice and must seek leave to amend via properly noticed motion and meet the relevant standard.
