            v.
 
LUIS DIAZ ROJAS, 
                        Defendant.
  


 
  Case No.:  22STCV41020
  Hearing Date:  September 11, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to compel responses
  to discovery




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On December 30, 2022, Plaintiff Jane
Doe filed this action against Defendant Luis Diaz Rojas stemming from an
alleged sexual assault. 
            On June 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to compel responses to discovery. Defendant filed his
opposition on August 26, 2024. Plaintiff filed her reply on September 3, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Discovery responses are due 30 days after
service of the requests, unless the parties stipulate or the court orders
otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260(a), 2031.260(a), 2033.250(a).) If a
responding party fails to respond in time, the propounding party may move for
an order compelling the responses or deeming matters admitted. (Id., §§
2030.290(b), 2031.300(b), 2033.280(b).) The responding party also waives its
objections. (Id., §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a).)  
 
DISCUSSION
            This motion concerns requests for
production served on April 5, 2024 and re-served on April 10, 2024. When
Plaintiff did not receive responses within 30 days, she emailed defense counsel
on May 14, 2024, requesting a response by May 24, 2024. Defense counsel
responded on May 15, 2024, stating that he personally mailed the responses on
May 1, 2024 because he had no internet while out of town. Plaintiff replied on
May 16, 2024, denying that she had received any responses by mail and stating
that the parties agreed to serve documents by email. Plaintiff requested that
Defendant email the discovery responses by May 23, 2024. Defendant has not
emailed any responses to Plaintiff. 
            Defendant’s opposition consists
solely of defense counsel’s declaration. Defense counsel avers that on May 1,
2024, he was in Nantucket, and the power and internet were down across the
island. (Koorenny Decl. ¶ 5.) As a result, defense counsel sent the responses
via U.S. Mail on May 1, 2024. (Ibid.) Defense counsel avers that
internet service did not return until “several days later.” (Ibid.)
Defense counsel claims that Plaintiff has “on many occasions, claimed not to
receive discovery and other items timely and properly mailed and sent to her.”
(Id., ¶ 3.) 
However, this is the first motion to
compel by Plaintiff. Defense counsel does not deny that the parties have agreed
to serve documents by email, nor does he deny that Plaintiff reminded him of
this agreement. Defense counsel does not explain why he has refused to email
the responses to Plaintiff after being notified that Plaintiff did not receive
the mailed responses. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to compel
responses is GRANTED. Defendant shall serve his responses to the subject
discovery by email and U.S. Mail within 5 days of this order. Defendant’s
request for sanctions is denied.
