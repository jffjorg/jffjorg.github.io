And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by Jane Doe, the plaintiff, to compel Luis Diaz Rojas, the defendant, to respond to discovery requests. The requests were served on April 5 and 10, 2024, but the defendant did not respond within the 30-day deadline. The plaintiff emailed the defendant's counsel on May 14, 2024, requesting a response by May 24, 2024, but the defendant has not responded. The defendant's opposition to the motion claims that he mailed the responses on May 1, 2024, but the plaintiff denied receiving them. The judge grants the motion and orders the defendant to serve his responses to the discovery by email and U.S. Mail within 5 days of the order. The judge also denies the defendant's request for sanctions.
