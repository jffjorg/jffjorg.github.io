Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer filed by the defendant, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The demurrer was filed in response to the First Amended Complaint filed by the plaintiffs, Loreen Avakian and Jeffrey Garza, alleging wrongful foreclosure, violation of the homeowners' bill of rights, and other claims. The court finds that the case is barred by the doctrine of res judicata, as the plaintiffs previously filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking relief against the defendant arising out of the same alleged wrongful foreclosure, and the court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice. The court also finds that the case is barred by the statute of limitations, as the plaintiffs' claims are time-barred and cannot be saved by the relation back doctrine. The court declines to rule on other issues presented in the demurrer and sustains the demurrer without leave to amend.
