Background Facts
Plaintiffs, Cindy Asuncion, Michael Padilla, Stephanie Gomez, Anthony
Gomez, and Nathan Padilla filed this action against Defendants, Nils Kolderup,
Kari Kolderup, Propwestmanco., Inc., and Gordon Ray Inman for damages arising
out exposure to toxic mold in their apartment. 
Stephanie, Anthony, and Nathan are minors and are appearing in the action
by and through their mother and GAL, Cindy. 
The minor plaintiffs suffered rashes and eye and sinus infections as a
result of the mold growth, but have recovered fully at this time.

Petitions to Approve Compromises of Minors
a.    
Initial
Note
Plaintiffs filed a Notice of
Settlement in this case on 9/23/21.  The
Court has held a total of ten OSC hearings since 9/23/21 concerning the necessary
petition to approve minor’s compromise and dismissal in light of the settlement.  On 8/24/23, the Court continued the hearing to
11/14/23 and ordered Petitioner to file papers no later than 10/13/23.  The Court noted that this would be the final
continuance of the matter.  
Petitioner filed these petitions on
11/03/23, only six court days prior to the hearing.  Petitioner did not file proof of service of the
petitions on Defendants.  These defects
will be discussed below.
 
b.    
Settlement
The parties have agreed to a global settlement of the action whereby
Plaintiffs would collectively receive $97,500. 
If the settlement is approved, Cindy will receive $32,595.97, Michael
will receive $27,568.08, Stephanie and Anthony will each receive $11,666.67,
and Nathan will receive $14,002.42 (notably, ¶10 of Anthony’s petition
erroneously indicates he will receive $14,002.42, but ¶16 and the attachment
indicate it is $11,666.67).  At
Attachment 11b(6), Petitioner explains that the apportionment is based on who
bore the rental and associated expenses incurred (the adult plaintiffs), as
well as the size of each plaintiff’s medical lien.  
 
If the minors’ settlements are approved, as to Stephanie and Anthony, $4666.67
will be used for attorneys’ fees and $2000.00 for medical expenses, leaving a
net balance of $5000.00.  As to Nathan, $5600.97
will be used for attorneys’ fees and $3401.45 for medical expenses, leaving a
net balance of $5000.00.  
 
c.    
Analysis
At ¶18b(8), Petitioner proposes to have the net balance of the
settlements held on any conditions the court determines to be in the best
interest of the minor children.  At attachment
18b(8), Petitioner indicates she wishes to have the proceeds deposited into a
federally insured financial institution and subject to withdrawal only upon
authorization of the court or at the time the children reach the age of
eighteen.  It is unclear why Petitioner
did not simply check ¶18b(2), which permits exactly this disposition of the
proceeds of the settlement, and which requires Attachment 18b(2), which must
state the name, branch, and address of the depository.  
The Court has reviewed the settlement and finds it is fair and
reasonable.  The Court is concerned about
the request for attorneys’ fees.  With respect
to Stephanie and Anthony, Counsel seeks to recover $4666.67 on a gross settlement
of $11,666.67, or 40%.  With respect to
Nathan, Counsel seeks to recover $5600.97 on a gross settlement of $14,002.42, also
40%.  The Court typically restricts
attorneys’ fees in cases involving minors to 25%.  The Court has reviewed Attachment 13a and
finds Counsel’s declaration does not indicate any exigent circumstances that
would support a fee in excess of the typical amount.  The Court will permit argument on this issue
at the time of the hearing.  The Court notes
that Petitioner failed, at ¶17, to indicate what fees Counsel will receive in
connection with the adult plaintiffs’ settlement in this case.  The Court wishes to hear from Counsel, at the
time of the hearing, concerning the aggregate fees to be paid to all plaintiffs
as a result of the settlement.  
 
d.    
Conclusion
As noted above, there is no proof of service of the petitions on
Defendants.  Additionally, the Court
cannot locate proposed orders approving the petitions or orders to place the
funds in blocked accounts.  The Court, at
the conclusion of the hearing, will continue the hearing to require service and
proposed order.  The Court will also, if
not satisfied with the discussion re: fees, require amended petitions
reflecting the proper amount of fees.  The
Court will order a specified date for the amended petitions (if necessary),
proposed orders, and proof of service to be filed.  Petitioner MUST adhere to the specified date,
and the Court will not consider late-filed papers.  
 
e.    
Appearance
Per CRC 7.952, Petitioner and Plaintiff must appear at the hearing
unless the Court finds good cause to excuse their appearance.  The minor children are eleven (Nathan),
fourteen (Anthony), and seventeen (Stephanie). 
The Court finds the children are of sufficient age to require them to
appear and testify along with Petitioner. 
They must appear at the hearing, and the Court will hear their testimony
in determining whether to approve the settlements.
