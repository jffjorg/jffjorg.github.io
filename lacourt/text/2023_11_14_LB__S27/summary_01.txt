And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petitions to approve compromises of minors and the proposed settlement agreement. The court finds that the settlement is fair and reasonable, but has concerns about the request for attorneys' fees. The court typically restricts attorneys' fees in cases involving minors to 25%, and is concerned that the requested fees are excessive. The court will permit argument on this issue at the hearing.

The court also notes that the petitions do not include proof of service of the petitions on the defendants, and that the proposed orders approving the petitions are missing. The court will continue the hearing to require service and proposed orders, and will also require amended petitions reflecting the proper amount of fees.

The court will also hear testimony from the minor children, who are required to appear and testify at the hearing. The court will determine whether to approve the settlements based on the testimony and the evidence presented.
