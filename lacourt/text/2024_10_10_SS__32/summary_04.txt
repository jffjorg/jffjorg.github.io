And here is a summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Evan Farr DDS, Inc. dba Santo Tomas Dental Group. The motion was filed in response to a medical negligence lawsuit filed by Plaintiff Blanca Reyes. The lawsuit alleges that the Defendant's employees, Soo Jin Chang, D.D.S. and Lari Soman Esmailian, D.D.S., were negligent in their performance of dental procedures on the Plaintiff.

The Defendant argued that it maintained an independent contractor relationship with Soo Jin Chang, D.D.S. and Lari Soman Esmailian, D.D.S. and therefore is not liable for their acts. The Defendant presented evidence that Soo Jin Chang, D.D.S. and Lari Soman Esmailian, D.D.S. were independent contractors, including independent contractor agreements and testimony from the dentists themselves.

The Court found that the Defendant had met its burden of proof and that there was no triable issue of fact. The Court granted the motion for summary judgment, ruling that the Defendant is not liable for the alleged negligence of Soo Jin Chang, D.D.S. and Lari Soman Esmailian, D.D.S.

Note: As this is a tentative ruling, the parties may still submit evidence or arguments prior to the hearing date, and the Court may alter or withdraw its tentative ruling.
