And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition for a minors' compromise filed by Lizeth Galvez Radillo on behalf of Julian Campos, who was 13 years old at the time of the incident. The court denies the petition without prejudice due to the lack of current medical records showing Claimant's current condition. The court requires further documentation, such as a parent declaration, to confirm Claimant's full recovery. The court also notes that the medical records attached to the petition are outdated and do not provide sufficient information. The court gives notice to the petitioner to complete item 12a and to file a proof of service. If the parties do not reach a resolution, they are required to appear in person or remotely at the hearing on October 10, 2024.
