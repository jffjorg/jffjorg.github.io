Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel further responses to the plaintiff's request for production of documents. The defendant had sought to compel further responses to numbers 1, 2, and 3, which relate to the plaintiff's insurance. The plaintiff had served verified responses on April 22, 2024, and the defendant's motion was due on June 10, 2024, but the parties did not meet and confer until August 2, 2024. The judge found that the deadline for the motion had expired and that the defendant did not have jurisdiction to file the motion. The judge also noted that there was no evidence that the parties had agreed in writing to extend the motion deadline. As a result, the motion was denied.
