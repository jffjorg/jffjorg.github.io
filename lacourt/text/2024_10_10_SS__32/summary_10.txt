And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of the defendant's counsel to be relieved as counsel, pending the filing and service of an updated proposed order. The motion is granted due to an irreconcilable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, including the failure of the client to pay fees and the non-cooperation of the client. However, the judge orders the counsel to file an amended form MC-053 with the client's current address and telephone number within 5 calendar days of the hearing. The counsel must also serve the signed order within 10 days of the date of the order and file a proof of service of such. The counsel will remain the attorney of record until the updated proposed order is filed and served.
