The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where the Plaintiff's counsel, Olivier Taillieu and Mathew Russel, are seeking to be relieved as counsel due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The motion was unopposed, but the Judge denied it due to lack of proof of personal service of the motion on the Plaintiff and incomplete information in the proposed order. The Judge also noted that the proposed order was incorrect and incomplete. The Court intends to deny the motion and requires counsel to provide notice of the Court's ruling and file proofs of service of such.
