And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which is a motion to compel a mental examination of the plaintiff, Kanwardeep Singh. The defendant, William N. Solis dba WNS Trucking and Epifanio Amilcar Solis Tello, is seeking to compel the plaintiff to undergo a mental examination in order to assess the plaintiff's mental condition. The plaintiff has opposed this motion, citing concerns about the scope of the examination and the use of the raw test data.

The court has ruled that the defendants' motion to compel a mental examination is granted, subject to certain limitations. The court has ordered that the raw data from the examination be provided to the plaintiff's counsel and that the plaintiff be allowed to audio record the examination. The court has also ruled that any ethical issues related to the use of the raw test data can be resolved through a protective order.

The court has rejected the plaintiff's request to exclude certain claims and has instead ordered that the plaintiff stipulate to exclude claims for mental and emotional distress over and above that usually associated with a traumatic brain injury. The court has also ruled that the plaintiff will not present any expert testimony at trial in support of this claim.

The court's ruling is tentative and is subject to change based on any further submissions or appearances at the hearing. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to determine if a resolution may be reached, and if not, to submit on the tentative ruling.
