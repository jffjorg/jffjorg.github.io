And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority's (LACMTA) motion for a protective order regarding a deposition of the Person Most Qualified (PMQ) to testify regarding matters related to the hiring and employment of Defendant Jon Paul Jimenez. LACMTA argued that the deposition is not relevant because it is admitting negligence and will argue that the plaintiff was also negligent, and therefore the deposition has no probative value. The plaintiff argued that the deposition is relevant to determine the extent of LACMTA's negligence and whether their training practices contributed to the incident. The judge found that the deposition is relevant to the issue of comparative fault, and therefore denied the motion for protective order.
