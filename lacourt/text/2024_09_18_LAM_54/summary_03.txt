And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to tax costs. The plaintiff seeks to tax certain costs as unreasonably high, not reasonably incurred, and not permitted by statute. The judge has granted the motion in part, allowing recovery of some costs and taxing others.

The judge has denied recovery of certain costs, including filing and motion costs, messenger fees, and a witness fee, as they were not reasonably incurred or permitted by statute. The judge has also allowed recovery of deposition and subpoena costs, but taxed a witness fee paid to a county employee as not recoverable.

The judge has also taxed certain "other" costs, including mock trial costs, jury selection costs, mileage and parking costs, and travel and lodging costs, as they are not recoverable under the costs statutes. The judge has allowed recovery of enlargement of exhibit costs, as they are allowed under the relevant statutes.

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to tax costs in part, and the parties are invited to submit on the tentative ruling by email to the courtroom before the hearing date.
