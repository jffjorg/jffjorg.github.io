ANALYSIS
 
On receipt of a response to
interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response if the propounding party deems that an objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general. (CCP 2030.300(a)(3).) The
responding party has the burden of justifying the objections to the form
interrogatories (“FIs”) and special interrogatories (“SIs”).  (Coy v. Sup.Ct. (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210,
220-221.) 
 
The moving party on a motion to compel
further responses to requests for production of documents (“RPDs”) must submit
“specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
inspection demand.”  (CCP §
2031.310(b)(1).)  If the moving party has
shown good cause for the RPDs, the burden is on the objecting party to justify
the objections.  (Kirkland v. Sup.Ct
(2002) 95 Cal. App.4th 92, 98.)
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further
responses to SIs and RPDs. 
 
A. Special Interrogatories 
 
SIs nos. 40-45 seek information
relating to Defendant’s policies and investigation into whether Plaintiff’s
vehicle, and other vehicles, are eligible for repurchase or replacement. These
requests seek relevant and discoverable information. Defendant has not opposed
this motion to show otherwise.
 
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further
responses to SIs is GRANTED.
 
B. Requests for Production
 
RPDs nos. 1, 3, 17, 37-81, 89 and 90
seek documents relating to the repairs of the subject vehicle, relating to the
handling of warranty repairs, and complaints made about the same year, make,
model of the subject vehicle. These requests seek relevant and discoverable
information. Defendant again has not opposed this motion to show otherwise. 
 
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further
responses to RPDs is GRANTED.
