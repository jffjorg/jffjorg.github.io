[1] Although Grano was not a party to Hi
Point’s original petition, Grano and Hi Point filed joint briefs on the pending
petitions and are represented by the same counsel. In any event the Court, as
noted, finds no change in facts that would justify the Court’s reaching a
different result. The Court incorporates in this ruling its March 9, 2023
ruling on this issue.
