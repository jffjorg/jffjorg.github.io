Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint and their motion to strike. The defendants demurred to the complaint on several grounds, including that the plaintiff lacks standing, fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and that the causes of action are uncertain. The judge has overruled the demurrer and denied the motion to strike.

The judge found that the plaintiff has standing to bring the present action, as it is a successor lessor pursuant to contractual assignments of all interests. The judge also found that the plaintiff has stated facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for breach of contract, including the existence of two leases, the plaintiff's performance or excuse for non-performance, the defendant's breach, and resulting damage to the plaintiff.

The judge denied the motion to strike the plaintiff's entire FAC on the ground that the plaintiff lacks standing, as the plaintiff has pleaded a contractual basis for attorney's fees. The judge also denied the motion to strike the prayer for damages, as the grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading and the defendants' motion is based on extrinsic evidence.

The defendants are ordered to answer the complaint within ten days of the date of the ruling.
