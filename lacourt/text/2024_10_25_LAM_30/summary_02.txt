And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Jane Hong's motion for a trial preference, citing that she has not provided sufficient evidence to support her request. Hong, who is 80 years old, has health issues including weakening legs and memory, but the court does not find that these issues are severe enough to warrant a trial preference. The court notes that Hong's work history does not affect her current health, and she has not provided evidence that her health will prejudice her interest in the litigation. The judge also denies Hong's alternative request for a trial preference under section 36, subdivision (e), citing that the court's discretion to grant such a request is limited. The motion is denied without prejudice, meaning that Hong may renew her motion and present further evidence of her health issues if appropriate.
