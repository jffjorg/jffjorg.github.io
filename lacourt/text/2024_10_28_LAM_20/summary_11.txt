And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, granting their motion for trial preference. The plaintiffs, who are the parents of three minor children, are seeking a trial preference under California Code of Civil Procedure section 36(b) due to the children's exposure to hazardous living conditions, including cockroaches, bed bugs, rodents, mold, water leaks, crumbling walls and ceilings, and deteriorated floors. The children, who are under the age of 14, have a substantial interest in the case as tenants of the subject premises and have allegedly suffered from respiratory issues and skin problems as a result of their exposure to these conditions.

The defendants argued that the homeowners association (HOA) should be held liable for some of the allegations and that a necessary party has not been added to the case. However, the judge ruled that the defendants' argument fails because joint, successive, and concurrent tortfeasors are not typically necessary parties in this type of case.

The judge also noted that the Complaint hardly mentions common areas and that the defendants have not filed a motion to file a cross-complaint. The judge set the trial date for February 25, 2024, and ordered the moving parties to give notice.
