 On July 15, 2024, Plaintiff Dean R. Isaacson filed a Complaint asserting two claims for breach of contract. Defendant Trancas PCH LLC now asserts a Demurrer with respect to the entirety of the Complaint. Because there is no opposition, the subject causes of action are deemed abandoned.  (Herzberg v. County of Plumas (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1, 20.)  The Demurrer is sustained, without leave to amend. The accompanying Motion to Strike is denied as moot.Moving party to give notice.
