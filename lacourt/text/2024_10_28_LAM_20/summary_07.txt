And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a case involving an unlawful detainer, where the issue of rent remains unresolved. The defendant, Jeffrey Benjamin, is seeking summary judgment, but the court notes that a proper proof of service was not provided. Specifically, the statement of service was not made under oath by a non-party. If the plaintiff was served, the court would grant summary judgment, as there is no opposition. However, the court will not grant any affirmative relief to the defendant, as he did not file a cross-complaint. The court orders the moving party to give notice and encourages counsel to submit on the tentative or appear remotely via LACourtConnect due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
