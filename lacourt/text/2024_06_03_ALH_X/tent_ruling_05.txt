CASE:                         Grijalva v.
Monterey Park Hospital AHMC et al.
 
CASE NO.:                 22AHCV00189
 
 
 
MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL

 
 
Counsel’s motion to be relieved is
granted on the terms stated.
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff James Grijalva filed this medical malpractice
action against defendants Monterey Park Hospital AHMC, John Doe, and Does 1 to
25 on January 30, 2024. Monterey Park filed its answer on April 17, 2024.
 
Plaintiff’s counsel Khashayar Eshraghi, Esq. (Counsel) of
Downtown L.A. Law Group has represented Plaintiff since the outset of the suit.
 
Counsel now moves to be relieved. The motion is unopposed.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez
v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal. App. 2d 398.)
 
Rule of Court 3.1362 prescribes the three mandatory forms
(MC-051, -052, and -053) that counsel must use when moving to be relieved. 
 
Subdivision (d) of the rule states the requirements for
service: service must be made on the moving counsel’s client and all parties
who have appeared. (Cal. R. Ct. 3.1362(d).) Service may be made personally or
by electronic or regular mail. (Ibid.) If served by mail, counsel must
submit a declaration attesting that either (1) the address is current; or (2)
the address is the last address known to counsel, and counsel made reasonable
efforts to locate a more current address within thirty (30) days of filing his,
her, or their motion. (Id., subd. (d)(1).) Counsel serving
electronically must attest that the client’s email address is current. (Id.,
subd. (d)(2).) “Current”, as used in the rule, means the address was confirmed
within 30 days of filing the motion. (Ibid.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Counsel has filed the requisite MC-051, -052, and -053
court forms. He attests to “an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship that stands in the way of effective representation. He confirms he
served Plaintiff at his last known address, return receipt requested, after
verifying the address via TransUnion’s True Lookup service. Trial in this case
is not set. The Proposed Order gives notice of the next appearance, the June 27
Case Management Conference. Withdrawal will not cause Plaintiff any prejudice.
 
However, Counsel has not filed a proof of service
attesting that he served not only his client, but also all other interested
parties.
 
The motion is granted contingent on Counsel’s filing a
proof of service on all interested parties.
 
RULING
 
The motion is granted on the terms stated.  The court will delay the effective date of
the order relieving counsel until (1) proof of service of a copy of the signed
order on the client and (2) proof that the client has been properly served with
notice of the next trial date have been filed with the court.
