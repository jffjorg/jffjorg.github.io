BACKGROUND
 
             This is a lemon law action arising out of
Plaintiff Matthew Ryan Helganz’s (“Plaintiff”) purchase/lease of
a 2020 Land Rover Range Rover Velar with the VIN SALYK2EX3LA258017 (“Subject
Vehicle”) on or about January 6, 2019. Plaintiff claims the Subject Vehicle was
substantially impaired due to defects/nonconformities that manifested
themselves during the warranty period and Defendant Jaguar Land Rover North
America, LLC (“Defendant”) failed to promptly replace or make restitution in
accordance with the Song-Beverly Act. 
 
            Plaintiff
filed a Complaint against Defendant on September 13, 2023, asserting causes of
action for: (1) Violation of Civil Code section 1793.2(d); (2) Violation of
Civil Code section 1793.2(b); (3) Violation of Civil Code section 1793.2(a)(3);
and (4) Breach of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses to his request for production of documents
(set one) is GRANTED. Defendant is ordered to provide further responses and a
privilege log within 30 days of this order. 
 
            Plaintiff’s
request for monetary sanctions is DENIED. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.210, subdivision (a), provides: “[t]he party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling has been directed shall respond
separately to each item or category of item by any of the following: [¶] (1) A statement that
the party will comply with the particular demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling by the date set for the inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of Section 2031.030 and
any related activities. [¶] (2) A
representation that the party lacks the ability to comply with the demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of a particular item or category of
item. [¶] (3) An
objection to the particular demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.210(a).)
 
“If the responding party objects
to the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of an item or
category of item, the response shall do both of the following: [¶] (1) Identify
with particularity any document, tangible thing, land, or electronically stored
information falling within any category of item in the demand to which an
objection is being made. [¶] (2) Set forth clearly the extent of, and the
specific ground for, the objection. If an objection is based on a claim of
privilege, the particular privilege invoked shall be stated. If an objection is
based on a claim that the information sought is protected work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010), that claim shall be expressly
asserted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.240(b).)
 
“If an objection is based on a
claim of privilege or a claim that the information sought is protected work
product, the response shall provide sufficient factual information for other
parties to evaluate the merits of that claim, including, if necessary, a
privilege log.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.240(c)(1).)
 
MEET AND CONFER 
            
            Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310 provides, in pertinent part, the
moving party shall include a meet and confer declaration as provided in section
2016.040. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(b).) The meet and confer declaration
“shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal
resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2016.040.) 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel has provided a meet and confer declaration attesting
to facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve this matter
prior to filing the instant motion. (Stoliker Decl., ¶¶26-29, Exs. 7-10.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff moves to strike
Defendant’s objections and compel Defendant to provide further responses to his
request for production (“RFP”) Nos. 1-3, 7-9, 15-16, 23-24, 27-28, 37-38,
49-50, 59-60, 65-66, 69-72, 78-79, 86, 88-90, 99, 113-118, and 129-130.
 
Request for
Production of Documents (Set One)
 
            Each of the specified RFPs requests
take the same form, requesting “all documents” such as summaries, memoranda,
powerpoints, communications with government agencies, internal investigations,
policies and procedures, and analysis of the Engine and Infotainment Defects directly
concerning the Subject Vehicle. In response to these requests, Defendant blanketly
asserted objections on the basis of attorney-client privilege, attorney-work
product doctrine, trade secret, confidential business information, premature
expert opinion, vagueness, overbreadth, and burden.
 
            Here, Plaintiff has shown that
Defendant’s responses to the RFPs are not code-complaint because they fail to
identify the specific documents that fall within the category of documents
being sought for which the objection was made. Furthermore, Plaintiff has
demonstrated good cause exists for compelling further responses to the RFPs.
Specifically, the RFPs are relevant to the claims at issue in this instant case
and seek information likely to lead to discovery of admissible such as whether
Defendant had prior knowledge of the defects/nonconformities purportedly
suffered by the Subject Vehicle. Moreover, the RFPs seek information directly
concerning the Subject Vehicle. Likewise, Defendant has not shown that it would
be unduly burdensome to produce these documents. 
 
            Therefore, the Court finds that an
order compelling further response to Plaintiff’s RFPs is warranted. 
 
Monetary Sanctions
 
“Except as provided in subdivision
(j), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a demand,
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(h).)
 
Here, Plaintiff’s counsel seeks
sanctions in the amount of $3,160.00 for an hourly rate of $395.00 for 8.0
hours spent in preparing this motion. (Stoliker Decl., ¶38; Mot. 17:11-15.) However
the Plaintiff did not include this (or any) amount in its initial motion.
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses to his request for production of documents
(set one) is GRANTED. Defendant is ordered to provide further responses and a
privilege log within 30 days of this order. 
 
            Plaintiff’s
request for monetary sanctions is DENIED.
 
            Moving
party to give notice.
