CASE:                         Hwang v. Wang et
al.
 
CASE NO.:                 22AHCV00428
 
 
 
MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL

 
The hearing on Counsel’s motion is
continued for Counsel to confer with his client and supplement his filing if
necessary.
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Dolly Hwang sued defendants Judy Chou Wang, Pod
John Michael Wang, Yaya Advisor, LLC, Milkie/Ferguson Investments, Inc., and
Does 1 through 50 on June 29, 2022 for breach of contract, fraud, conspiracy,
elder abuse, and related claims. She filed her operative second amended
complaint on April 12, 2024.
 
Defendant Judy Chou Wang cross-complained against
cross-defendants Dolly Hwang (plaintiff) and Pei Wen Tsai on December 30, 2022,
in propria persona, for (1) Abuse of Process, (2) Fraud; Fraudulent
Concealments [sic], and (3) Breach of Traditional Enforceable Contract. She
filed her operative first amended cross-complaint on October 20, 2023.
 
On February 23, 2024, counsel Matthew R. Hamilton
(Counsel) of Hamilton Law, Ltd. substituted as defendant/cross-complainant
Wang’s counsel of record.
 
On April 12, 2024, Wang filed a Second Amended
Cross-Complaint.
 
On May 14, 2024, Counsel moved to be relieved.
 
On May 21, 2024, Wang filed a thirty-page (30-page)
handwritten “Response to Extend Time to Oppose or Accept Attorney’s Withdraw [sic]
Motion Due to Auto Accident that Injury [sic] My Compressed Fracture of
Spine.” It is unclear whether this Response is filed in opposition or agreement
with Counsel’s motion; it consists largely of a narrative criticism of
Counsel’s lifestyle.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez
v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal. App. 2d 398.)
 
Rule of Court 3.1362 prescribes the three mandatory forms
(MC-051, -052, and -053) that counsel must use when moving to be relieved. 
 
Subdivision (d) of the rule states the requirements for
service: service must be made on the moving counsel’s client and all parties
who have appeared. (Cal. R. Ct. 3.1362(d).) Service may be made personally or
by electronic or regular mail. (Ibid.) If served by mail, counsel must
submit a declaration attesting that either (1) the address is current; or (2)
the address is the last address known to counsel, and counsel made reasonable
efforts to locate a more current address within thirty (30) days of filing his,
her, or their motion. (Id., subd. (d)(1).) Counsel serving
electronically must attest that the client’s email address is current. (Id.,
subd. (d)(2).) “Current”, as used in the rule, means the address was confirmed
within 30 days of filing the motion. (Ibid.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
The Court sees no undue prejudice to Wang if Counsel
withdraws at this time, more than six months before trial with no hearings set
in the interim. Counsel attested to serving Wang by mail at her last known
address by telephone, and she clearly received service and had the opportunity
to respond.
 
However, Counsel did not file a Proposed Order (MC-053),
nor a proof of service on all interested parties apart from Ms. Wang.
 
The Court cannot grant the motion due to these procedural deficiencies.
The motion is continued to June 24, 2024. In the interim Counsel should confer
with his client regarding the withdrawal and, if necessary, supplement his
filing as necessary for the Court to grant his motion.
 
RULING
 
The hearing on Counsel’s motion is continued to June 24,
2024.
