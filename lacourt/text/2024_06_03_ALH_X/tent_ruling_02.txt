CASE:                         Mejia v. Garrido
et al.
 
CASE NO.:                 22AHCV00414
 
 
 
MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL

 
 
Counsel’s motion to be relieved is
granted on the terms stated.
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Heber Nahum Jordan Mejia filed this
landlord/tenant action against defendants Mario and Floridalma Garrido on February
28, 2023. Defendants cross-complained against Plaintiff on January 16, 2024 and
filed a general denial.
 
A final status conference is set for October 31, 2024, and
a jury trial for November 12, 2024. No other appearances are currently set,
apart from the instant hearing.
 
Counsel Robert F. Smith (Counsel) has represented
Defendants/Cross-Complainants beginning with their first appearance on January
16, 2024.
 
Counsel now moves to be relieved. He has filed separate
motions for each of his clients. Neither motion is opposed.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez
v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal. App. 2d 398.)
 
Rule of Court 3.1362 prescribes the three mandatory forms
(MC-051, -052, and -053) that counsel must use when moving to be relieved. 
 
Subdivision (d) of the rule states the requirements for
service: service must be made on the moving counsel’s client and all parties
who have appeared. (Cal. R. Ct. 3.1362(d).) Service may be made personally or
by electronic or regular mail. (Ibid.) If served by mail, counsel must
submit a declaration attesting that either (1) the address is current; or (2)
the address is the last address known to counsel, and counsel made reasonable
efforts to locate a more current address within thirty (30) days of filing his,
her, or their motion. (Id., subd. (d)(1).) Counsel serving
electronically must attest that the client’s email address is current. (Id.,
subd. (d)(2).) “Current”, as used in the rule, means the address was confirmed
within 30 days of filing the motion. (Ibid.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Counsel has filed the requisite MC-051, -052, and -053
court forms. He attests to service by mail at an address verified by
conversation. He attests to a breakdown in relations with his clients. The
Proposed Order gives notice of the next scheduled appearances, the earliest of
which is still nearly five months away. Withdrawal will not prejudice
Defendants / Cross-Complainants.
 
However, Counsel has not filed a proof of service
attesting that he served not only his client, but also all other interested
parties.
 
The motion is granted contingent on Counsel’s filing a
proof of service on all interested parties.
 
RULING
 
The motion is granted on the terms stated.  The court will delay the effective date of
the order relieving counsel until (1) proof of service of a copy of the signed
order on the client and (2) proof that the client has been properly served with
notice of the next trial date have been filed with the court.
