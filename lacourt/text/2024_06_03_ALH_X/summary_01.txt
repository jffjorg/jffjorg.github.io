And here is the English summary:

The tentative ruling by Judge Joel L. Lofton continues the hearing on Counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel to June 24, 2024. The court sees no undue prejudice to Wang if Counsel withdraws, but Counsel did not file a Proposed Order (MC-053) and did not provide proof of service on all interested parties. Therefore, the court cannot grant the motion at this time.
