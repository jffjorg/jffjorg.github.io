MOTION
 
This case arises from a dispute concerning a loan that was not
repaid.  On December 27, 2022, Plaintiff (and
now Judgment Creditor) New City Releasing, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed suit
against Defendants Morning-Night View LLC (“Morning-Night”) and Yvonne Niami
(“Niami”) (together, “Defendants”) alleging two causes of action for (1)
promissory note; and (2) personal guaranty. 

 
Default judgment was entered against both Defendants on January 2,
2024 in the amount of $11,907,475.58.
 
Plaintiff now moves for a charging order as to Defendant (and Judgment
Debtor) Yvonne Niami’s membership interest in the limited liability companies
Philanthropy LLC and Viva XXXII LLC. 
Plaintiff’s motion is unopposed.
 
REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
            Plaintiff requests judicial notice
of the following:
 
·      
Exhibit 2: Certified copies of n:Philanthropy
LLC’s Initial Filing with the California Secretary of State filed on November
25, 2013, and the most recent Statement of Information filed with the
California Secretary of State on May 11, 2022.
 
·      
Exhibit 3: Certified copies of Viva XXXII LLC’s
Initial Filing with the California Secretary of State filed on August 6, 2015,
Certificate of Conversion filed on February 2, 2018, and the most recent
Statement of Information filed with the California Secretary of State on June
24, 2020.
 
Plaintiff bases the request on Evidence Code section 452, subdivisions
(d) and (h), which provide that judicial notice may be taken of: 
 
(d) Records of (1) any court of this state or (2)
any court of record of the United States or of any state of the United States.
 
(h) Facts and propositions that are not
reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate
determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.
 
            Filings made with the California
Secretary of State are not court records. 
Therefore, judicial notice of these documents is not appropriate under
subdivision (d).
 
            Under subdivision (h), the Court
cannot take judicial notice of the truth of hearsay statements contained in
documents third parties filed with the California Secretary of State, as the
accuracy of the content of those documents may be subject to dispute.  (See, e.g., Lockley v. Law Office of Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875, 882.)  
 
            Therefore,
the Court may only take judicial notice of the fact that this information has
been publicly filed with the California Secretary of State, and the dates of
such filings, but not the facts contained therein.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
            Code of Civil Procedure section
708.310 provides, “If a money judgment is rendered against a partner or member
but not against the partnership or limited liability company, the judgment
debtor’s interest in the partnership or limited liability company may be
applied toward the satisfaction of the judgment by an order charging the
judgment debtor’s interest pursuant to Section 15907.03, 16504, or 17705.03 of
the Corporations Code.”
 
            Corporations Code section 17705.03,
subdivision (a) provides: “On application by a judgment creditor of a member or
transferee, a court may enter a charging order against the transferable
interest of the judgment debtor for the unsatisfied amount of the judgment. A
charging order constitutes a lien on a judgment debtor’s transferable interest
and requires the limited liability company to pay over to the person to which
the charging order was issued any distribution that would otherwise be paid to
the judgment debtor.”
 
            Here, default judgment was entered
against both Defendants in the amount of $11,907,475.58 on January 2, 2024.  (See Judgment.)  Post-judgment interest begins to accrue as of
the date of judgment, even though the exact dollar amount had not yet been
ascertained.  (See Felczer v. Apple
Inc. (2021) 63 Cal.App.5th 406.) 
Post-judgment interest accrues at a rate of 10 percent.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 685.010.)
 
Plaintiff
has provided evidence that Niami is listed as a Manager or Member and the Chief
Executive Officer (“CEO”) of N:Philanthropy LLC (Ex. 2 to Groeneveld Decl.) and
the Organizer, Manager or Member, CEO, and Agent for Service of Process for
VIVA XXXII LLC (Ex. 3 to Groeneveld Decl.). 
 Thus, Plaintiff has provided
evidence that Niami has an ownership interest in both N:Philanthropy LLC and in
VIVA XXXII LLC, and Niami has not provided any evidence to the contrary.
 
Plaintiff
also indicates “Judgment debtors have not made any voluntary payments on the
judgment and New City Releasing, Inc. has not collected anything on the
judgment.”  (Groeneveld Decl. ¶ 4.)  
 
            Therefore, Plaintiff has
demonstrated that Niami owes the balance of the judgment, and Niami has an
ownership interest in N:Philanthropy LLC and in VIVA XXXII LLC, to which
Plaintiff may attach to recover the outstanding balance of the judgment.
 
            As such, Plaintiff seeks $12,729,580.74,
representing the full $11,907,475.58 judgment plus 10% annual post-judgment interest
thereon for the 252 days from the January 2, 2024 judgment up to and including September
10, 2024, the date of Plaintiff’s motion.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion is granted and the Court will enter the Order
as proposed, except for the accounting requirements set forth in paragraphs 3
and 6.  
 
If applicable, Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling
and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
