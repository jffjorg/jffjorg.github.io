And here is the English text summary:

The Judge, Michael E. Whitaker, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Lusin Ghazaryan, counsel for Plaintiff Daniel Thomas Paul, to be relieved as counsel. The motion is unopposed. The Judge finds that the motion is procedurally proper, as Counsel has filed all required forms and served them on the client and other parties. The Judge also finds that the motion is substantively proper, as there has been an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship that makes it impossible for Counsel to effectively represent the client.

The Judge grants the motion and orders Counsel to serve the signed order on the client and other parties within 10 days of the date of the order. Counsel must also file a proof of service and update the Court's records. The Judge notes that Counsel will remain the attorney of record for the Plaintiff until the requisite proof of service is filed.
