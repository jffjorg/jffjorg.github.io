As for the English-text summary, here it is:

The tentative ruling grants Defendant Young Men's Christian Association of Metropolitan Los Angeles' motion to compel production of business records from Del Amo Hospital and Glendale Memorial Hospital. The court finds that the hospital records are "reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence" and that it is unlikely that Defendant can obtain full and accurate records through other means. The court balances the parties' rights to discovery and privacy interests and concludes that the balance weighs in favor of disclosure of the records. The Defendant may submit proposed orders to be served upon the hospitals.
