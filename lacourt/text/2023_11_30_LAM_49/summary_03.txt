And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants in part and denies in part the motion to quash the subpoena for production of business records. The Law Offices of Scott C. Glovsky, APC, are ordered to comply with paragraphs 1-7 and 13-14 of the subpoena, which seeks documents or communications involving Plaintiff and her counsel regarding amounts owed to or recoverable by counsel under the fee agreement. The law firm need not comply with paragraphs 8-12 of the subpoena, which seeks documents involving parties not involved with this litigation.

The judge also grants the motion to quash the subpoena for personal appearance of Scott C. Glovsky, APC, the individual attorney who represents Plaintiff. The judge finds that there are other practicable means to obtain the discovery sought, including the document production discussed and permitted above, and that deposing opposing counsel is unnecessary.

The judge declines to award expenses as the motions were not made or opposed in bad faith or without substantial justification. The parties are ordered to give notice of the ruling, unless waived.
