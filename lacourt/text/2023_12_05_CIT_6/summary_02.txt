And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication filed by Dr. Prakash Patel and Hardika Patel (cross-defendants) against Bhrat Patel and Dinesh Patel (cross-complainants). The motion was based on the argument that there is no triable issue of material fact regarding the cross-complaint and its five causes of action. The judge finds that the cross-defendants have failed to establish the absence of a triable issue of material fact on each of the causes of action, including breach of contract, fraud (misrepresentation), fraud (concealment), conspiracy to commit fraud, and declaratory relief. The judge also finds that the cross-defendants' arguments regarding res judicata are without merit. As a result, the judge denies the motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication and will proceed to address the motion.
