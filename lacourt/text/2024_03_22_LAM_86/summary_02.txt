Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Los Angeles is ordered to provide supplemental privilege logs for withheld and redacted documents. The City's original privilege logs are deemed insufficient by the court, and the City must provide more detail about the nature of the documents withheld or redacted. The court finds that the City acted with substantial justification in opposing the Petitioner's motion, and therefore denies the Petitioner's request for monetary sanctions.
