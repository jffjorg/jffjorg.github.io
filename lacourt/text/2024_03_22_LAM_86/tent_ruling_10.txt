[1] The
court finds City & County of San Francisco v. Daley (1993) 16
Cal.App.4th 734, relied upon by Plaintiff, inapposite. There, the court relied
on Code of Civil Procedure section 564, subdivision (b)(3) as the authority to
appoint a receiver. As there is no judgment of nuisance here, this cannot be a
post-judgment appointment of a receiver to aid the enforcement of a judgment.


[2] Bollier’s
declaration references an Exhibit Q which is not attached to his declaration.


[3] Plaintiff
has provided no evidence of trespassers or squatters at the Property after July
2023.


[4] Certainly,
the Property is unsightly. It is not clear to the court the Property represents
a dangerous condition in its current state. There is also no evidence of any
impact on neighboring businesses or the community.


[5] In
reply, Plaintiff presents hearsay evidence from “two different nearby
residential neighbors” that “transients occupy the outside and inside of the building
leaving behind trash and human waste.” (Bollier Reply Dec. ¶ 4.)
