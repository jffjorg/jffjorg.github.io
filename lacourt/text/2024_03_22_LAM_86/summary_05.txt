And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Mitchell Beckloff granting a writ of attachment to Zions Bancorporation, N.A. dba California Bank & Trust against Kurtis Rintala in the amount of $58,665.60. The basis for the attachment is a guaranty agreement executed by Rintala in connection with a business credit card issued by the bank. Rintala failed to make monthly payments, and the bank declared the unpaid balance as immediately due and payable. The bank alleges that Rintala owes $49,818.35 in principal, $5,754.01 in accrued interest, $90 in late/over limit fees, and $2,003.24 in attorney's fees and costs. The court finds that the bank has established the probable validity of its claims and that the attachment is proper. The court also orders that the bank post a $10,000 undertaking before issuance of the writ of attachment.
