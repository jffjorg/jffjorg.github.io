And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the issue of appointing a receiver to deal with a property that is allegedly in a state of disrepair. The court finds that City & County of San Francisco v. Daley (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 734, relied upon by the plaintiff, is inapplicable because there is no judgment of nuisance to enforce. The court also notes that the property is unsightly, but there is no evidence that it poses a dangerous condition or has a negative impact on neighboring businesses or the community. The court is skeptical of the plaintiff's claims about trespassers or squatters at the property, as there is no evidence of this after July 2023. The court is also concerned about the lack of attachment of Exhibit Q to the declaration of Bollier, one of the parties involved. Overall, the court's tentative ruling suggests that the appointment of a receiver may not be necessary or justified in this case.
