seemingly requires less of a showing to establish the attorney-client

the privilege has the burden of establishing the preliminary facts necessary to
support the exercise, i.e., a communication made in the course of an
attorney-client relationship. [Citations.] Once that party establishes
facts necessary to support a prima facie claim of privilege, the communication
is presumed to have been made in confidence and the opponent of the claim of
privilege has the burden of proof to establish the communication was not
confidential or that the privilege does not for other reasons apply.

Catalina arose in the context of the Civil Discovery Act while Costco
Wholesale Corp. v. Superior Court largely analyzes the Evidence Code. As
the CPRA is subject to the Civil Discovery Act (City of Los Angeles v.
Superior Court (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 272, 284-292), the court finds
compliance with Catalina appropriate. Catalina made clear the
privilege log must “identif[y] each withheld document with particularity and
provide[] sufficient factual information for [the] court to evaluate each
privilege claim.” (Catalina,
supra, 242 Cal.App.4th at 1132.)
