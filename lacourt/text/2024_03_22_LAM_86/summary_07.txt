And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to seal portions of Defendant Wittenberg's declaration, which was filed in support of his opposition to Plaintiff's ex parte application for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. The judge found that the motion did not include a declaration stating sufficient facts to justify sealing the document, and therefore, the court could not make any factual findings addressing the requirements for sealing. The judge also found that there was no overriding interest to justify sealing the record, as the allegations made by Defendant Wittenberg were not defamatory or irrelevant to the lawsuit. The judge noted that the facts in this case were different from those in Warner v. Warner, where a party's lawyer was subject to irrelevant and defamatory attacks in a pleading. As a result, the judge denied the motion to seal and ordered that the document remain publicly accessible.
