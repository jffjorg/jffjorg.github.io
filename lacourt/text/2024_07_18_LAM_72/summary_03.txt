And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Sherri Sheffield v. City of Gardena et al. regarding the demurrer to the answer filed by defendant Frazier Watts. The court sustains the demurrer to certain affirmative defenses, including those that fail to allege outside material and are simply restated denials of the factual allegations. The court overrules the demurrer to other affirmative defenses. The court also grants the motion to strike Watts' prayer for attorney's fees in his answer. The court finds that the affirmative defenses that are sustained do not state a sufficient defense to the plaintiff's claims, and therefore, the demurrer is sustained. The court's ruling is subject to change after hearing from the parties.
