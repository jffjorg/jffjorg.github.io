Summary:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the Judge's thinking based on the information presented before the hearing. The court has denied Defendant's motion for summary judgment and granted summary adjudication on some claims, but denied summary adjudication on others. The Judge has found that there are triable issues of fact regarding Plaintiff's disability and accommodation requests, and that Defendant's legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for termination may not preclude a finding of discrimination. The Judge has also found that Defendant failed to engage in the interactive process in good faith and that Plaintiff's suggested wrist strap accommodation could have improved her job performance.
