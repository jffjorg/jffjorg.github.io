Background
 
This is an unlawful detainer case. The following facts are
taken from the allegations and attached exhibits in Plaintiff’s Complaint,
except where otherwise noted.
 
Plaintiff is the owner of real property that is legally
described as “Lot 446 of Tract No. 1446, in the City of Los Angeles, County of
Los Angeles, State of California, as per Map recorded in Book 20, Page 34 of
Maps, in the office of the County recorder of said County” (the “Property”).
The Property contains a multi-unit building which is comprised of four units
with the following addresses: (1) 2757 South Mansfield Avenue, Los Angeles, CA
90016; (2) 2759 South Mansfield Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90016; (3) 5107
Westhaven St., Los Angeles, CA 90016; and (4) 5109 Westhaven St., Los Angeles,
CA 90016.
 
Defendant is a tenant at the Property pursuant to a lease
agreement that pre-dates Plaintiff’s ownership of the Property. Defendant
occupies 2759 South Mansfield Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90016 (the “Unit”).
 
Plaintiff entered an agreement to sell the Property to a
third party. The third party wished to inspect the Property, including the
Unit. On August 9, 2023, Plaintiff served on Defendant a notice requiring
Defendant to permit an inspection of the Property and Unit. Plaintiff
subsequently delivered a second letter requesting the same, on an unspecified
date. Defendant did not allow Plaintiff to inspect the Property and the Unit.
 
Plaintiff alleges that on August 11, 2023 and August 24,
2023, Plaintiff served a written notice on Defendant to allow the inspections
of the Property and Unit or quit and deliver possession of the Property and
Unit to Plaintiff within three days. (Complaint, Ex. 2 (the “August 24 Notice”.)
Plaintiff only attaches a copy of the August 24, 2023 notice, and not the
August 11, 2023 notice. Exhibit 2 does not contain a request that Defendant
permit inspection of the Property and Unit. Rather, Exhibit 2 states that
Defendant’s right to occupy the Unit will be terminated because the Property
was sold at a non-judicial foreclosure sale on May 9, 2023.
 
On September 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint against
Defendant in the Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles Stanley Mosk
Courthouse, Department 78, Case No. 23STCV21442 (the “Department 78 Action”),
raising a claim for unlawful detainer. (Request for Judicial Notice, Ex. A.)
The complaint in the Department 78 Action seeks restitution and possession of
the Property and Unit, damages, and costs of suit. The complaint in the
Department 78 action attaches as Exhibit 2 a three-day notice to quit that was
served on August 24, 2023 and is identical to the August 24 Notice attached as
Exhibit 2 in this action.
 
On October 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed this action (the
“Department 72 Action”), raising a claim against Plaintiff for unlawful
detainer. The Complaint seeks restitution of the Unit, damages, and costs of
suit.
 
On February 29, 2024, the Court stayed this case pending the
resolution of the Department 78 Action under the doctrine of exclusive
concurrent jurisdiction.
 
On May 14, 2024, judgment was entered for Defendant in the
Department 78 Action as a result of Defendant’s demurrer in that case.
 
On June 18, 2024, Plaintiff moved for an order lifting the
stay in this case and granting leave to amend the Complaint. Defendant did not
file an opposition.
 
Discussion
 
Lift Stay
 
“Under the rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction, when
two [California] superior courts have concurrent jurisdiction over the subject
matter and all parties involved in litigation, the first to assume jurisdiction
has exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over the subject matter and all
parties involved until such time as all necessarily related matters have been
resolved.” (People ex rel. Garamendi v. American Autoplan, Inc. (1993)
20 Cal.App.4th 760, 769-770 [internal quotations and citations omitted].)
“[T]he pendency of another earlier action growing out of the same transaction
and between the same parties is a ground for abatement of the second action.” (Id.
at 770 [internal quotations and citations omitted].) “The rule is based upon
the public policies of avoiding conflicts that might arise between courts if
they were free to make contradictory decisions or awards relating to the same
controversy and preventing vexatious litigation and multiplicity of suits.” (Shaw
v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (2022) 78 Cal.App.5th 245, 255
[internal citations omitted].) 
 
The rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction and the
statutory plea in abatement should be raised by demurrer where the issue
appears on the face of the complaint and by answer where factual issues must be
resolved. (Garamendi, supra, 20 Cal.App.4th at p. 771.) “Where
abatement is required [under the plea in abatement or the rule of exclusive
concurrent jurisdiction], the second action should be stayed, not dismissed.” (Ibid.)
 
Furthermore, "[a] party against whom a complaint has
been filed may object to the pleading on the grounds that “[t] is another
action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 430.10, subd. (c).)
 
            The
Court previously stayed this action pending the resolution of the Department 78
Action. The Department 78 Action has now been resolved.
 
            The
Court therefore lifts the stay on this case. 
 
Leave to Amend
 
A complainant may obtain leave from the trial court to amend
their pleading beyond the number of amendments allowed under Code of Civil
Procedure section 472 (a) by filing a noticed motion. (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1324.) The motion must be accompanied by a declaration stating: (1) the
effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3)
when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4)
why the request was not made earlier.¿(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324 (b).)
 
“Any judge, at any time before or after commencement of
trial, in the furtherance of justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, may
allow the amendment of any pleading or pretrial conference order.”¿(Code Civ.
Proc., § 576.) In the absence of a showing of prejudice from the opposing side,
the trial court ordinarily lacks discretion to deny a motion to amend a
pleading. (Honig v. Financial Corp. of America (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 960,
965.)            
 
Plaintiff seeks leave to amend in order to address a defect
that led to Defendant’s demurrers – namely, to attach the correct Notice to
Quit and Proof of Service to the complaint. The Court finds that such amendment
is in the interests of justice and grants leave to amend for this purpose.
 
Plaintiff also seeks to plead an alternate cause of action
based on a Notice to Quit that was served after this case was initiated by
Defendant. The Court finds that such amendment is in the interests of justice
and judicial economy and grants leave to amend for this purpose.
 
Plaintiff seeks to add additional parties that Plaintiff has
since discovered who may have an interest in this case. Plaintiff has not
explained when it discovered these facts, and in fact seems to simply be adding
other alleged occupants of the Property as defendants. The Court grants leave
to amend for this purpose.
