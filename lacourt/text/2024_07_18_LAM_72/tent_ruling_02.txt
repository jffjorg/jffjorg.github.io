Defendant Real Time Staffing Servies, LLC d/b/a Select
Staffing (“Real Time”) demurs to the twelfth cause of action for failure to
provide meal and rest breaks in the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) filed by
Plaintiff Maria Cristina Soto (“Plaintiff”).
 
The Court SUSTAINS Real Time’s demurrer to the twelfth cause
of action WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
Background
 
Plaintiff filed this action on April 20, 2022 against
Defendants Real Time, St. Clair, Novel Alamilla, Pirate Staffing (“Pirate”),
Pirate California Holdings, LLC (“Pirate Holdings”), and Commerce Temporary
Staffing Services, LLC (“Commerce”).
 
Plaintiff was employed by Real Time, a temporary employee
company. Real Time entered an agreement with St. Clair, whereby Real Time
provided its employees to work at St. Clair’s warehouse. Plaintiff was one such
employee.
 
While Plaintiff worked at the St. Clair Warehouse, another
temporary employee, Novel Alamilla, allegedly harassed and retaliated against
Plaintiff. Alamilla was not employed by Real Time, but by Pirate Holdings.
 
Plaintiff filed this action on April 20, 2022.
 
The FAC raises claims for (1) gender based harassment; (2)
sexual harassment; (3) failure to prevent discrimination and harassment; (4)
failure to correct and remedy discrimination and harassment; (5) retaliation
for complaints of discrimination and harassment; (6) violation of
whistle-blowing law; (7) wrongful termination; (8) hostile work environment;
(9) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (10) negligent infliction of
emotional distress; (11) failure to permit inspection of personnel and payroll
records in violation of Labor Code section 1198.5; (12) failure to provide meal
and rest breaks; and (13) violation of Business and Professions Code, sections
17200 et seq.
 
Real Time demurred to the twelfth claim on June 25, 2024.
Plaintiff filed an opposition and Real Time filed a reply.
 
Legal Standard
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading
alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants,
Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) The court assumes the truth
of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.) The only issue a demurrer is
concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of
action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be
allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335,
348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Ibid.;
Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f
there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause
of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).
 
Discussion
 
Claims for unpaid wages and missed breaks generally have a
3-year statute of limitations. (Code Civ. Proc., § 338, subd. (a).) 
 
Plaintiff was terminated in June, 2020. Plaintiff first
moved for leave to amend on April 11, 2024. Thus, in order to satisfy the
statute of limitations, Plaintiff’s meal and rest break claim must relate back
to her other claims.
 
“[I]f an amendment is sought after the statute of
limitations has run, the amended complaint will be deemed filed as of the date
of the original complaint provided recovery is sought in both pleadings on the
same general set of facts.” (Amaral v. Cintas Corporation No. 2 (2008)
163 Cal.App.4th 1157, 1199.) “A new cause of action in an amended complaint is
held to relate back to the earlier pleaded claims if the later cause of action
‘(1) rest[s] on the same general set of facts, (2) involve[s] the same
injury, and (3) refer[s] to the same instrumentality, as the
original one.’” (Brumley v. FDCC California, Inc. (2007) 156
Cal.App.4th 312, 323 [emphasis in original].) 
As both parties agree, “the critical inquiry is whether the defendant
had adequate notice of the claim based on the original pleading.”  (Pointe San Diego Residential Community,
L.P. v. Procopio, Cory, Hargreaves & Savitch LLP (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th
265, 276.)  
 
The allegations in the FAC that Plaintiff argues “relate
back” to the Original Complaint do not meet these standards.  The FAC alleges that Defendants consistently
required Plaintiff to work periods well over four hours a day without being
provided breaks, and over five hours a day without being provided meal periods.
(FAC ¶¶ 98-99.) 
 
By contrast, Plaintiff’s allegations in her original
Complaint regarding meal and rest breaks are very limited. In particular,
Plaintiff alleged:
 
“Throughout
Plaintiff’s employment with Defendants, her manager at [St. Clair] forbade her,
and other female employees, from using the restroom while on the clock. When
Plaintiff would need to use the restroom, her manager would snap his fingers
and call her back to her station. Plaintiff would have to wait for a break or
clock out in order to use the restroom. Plaintiff’s male counterparts were not
prevented from using the restroom at any given time.” 
 
(Complaint ¶ 17.)
 
This allegation in the Original Complaint was part of the
basis for Plaintiff’s discrimination and harassment claims.
 
The Original Complaint does not allege that Defendants
denied her any break periods. The Original Complaint alleged only that
Plaintiff was prevented from using the bathroom outside of break time.  These are not the same facts—not even the
same “general” facts—alleged in the FAC. Nor do they have the same injury or
instrumentality.  They certainly did not
give Real Time notice that there was a claim that Plaintiff was denied any
breaks or meal periods.
 
Apart from the argument that the claim relates back,
Plaintiff does not dispute that the twelfth claim runs afoul of the statute of
limitations.  Because the claim does not
relate back, it is time-barred.
 
The Court therefore sustains Real Time’s demurrer to the
twelfth cause of action without leave to amend.
