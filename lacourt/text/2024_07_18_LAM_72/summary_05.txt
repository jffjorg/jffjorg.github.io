And here is a summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Oren Ben Elisha and Yosef Ben Elisha (Plaintiffs) against Christina Ying Dong and Sylmar Calvert LLC (Defendants). The case concerns a dispute over a notice of lis pendens recorded on a property in Van Nuys, California. The Plaintiffs filed a notice of lis pendens on April 5, 2024, and the Defendants moved to expunge the notice on July 9, 2024.

The Court found that the Plaintiffs did not substantially comply with the notice statute and that their claims do not satisfy the probable validity test. Specifically, the Court found that the Plaintiffs' claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, accounting, and dissolution of partnership are not real property claims. The Court also found that the Plaintiffs' claims for resulting trust, constructive trust, and quiet title are not supported by the evidence.

As a result, the Court granted the Defendants' motion and ordered the expungement of the Plaintiffs' lis pendens on the Property. The Court's ruling means that the Plaintiffs' claims will be dismissed, and the Defendants will be allowed to proceed with the sale of the Property.
