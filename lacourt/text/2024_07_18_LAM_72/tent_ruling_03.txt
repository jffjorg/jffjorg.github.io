Background
 
The following facts are taken from the allegations in
Plaintiff’s FAC.
 
Plaintiff is an employee of Defendant City of Gardena
(“Gardena”). Plaintiff has been a bus driver who works for Gardena’s
transportation department (“G-Trans”) for more than 20 years.
 
On September 19, 2022, Plaintiff went to the G-Trans
dispatch window to meet with her supervisor, Donnie Harris. Harris asked
Plaintiff to instead meet with him in the supervisor’s office.
 
Plaintiff went to enter the supervisor’s office, where she
encountered Defendant Watts, a manager of the Training Department of G-Trans.
Watts grabbed Plaintiff by her left arm, wrenching it and hurting her, and told
her “you can’t come in.” Plaintiff called out and told Watts that he was
hurting her. Watts responded, “so what?” Watts provided no subsequent
explanation for the attack.
 
Plaintiff alleges that Gardena has known for years that
Watts was a danger to the safety of female employees. Plaintiff alleges that
there have been multiple complaints and even lawsuits filed against Watts and
Gardena based on Watts’ mistreatment of women, including physical attacks.
Plaintiff alleges that no adequate investigations or disciplinary actions have
been instituted to curb Watts’ abuses or protect female employees who come into
contact with Watts.
 
Plaintiff filed this action against Gardena and Watts on
June 30, 2023. The operative complaint is now the FAC, which raises claims for
(1) assault; (2) gender discrimination; (3) gender-based harassment; (4)
failure to prevent harassment; (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress
(“IIED”); (6) negligence; (7) retaliation; and (8) failure to engage in the
interactive process.
 
Watts filed an answer to the FAC on May 6, 2024, stating a
general denial and raising 26 affirmative defenses.
 
Plaintiff demurred to the answer on June 12, 2024. Watts
filed an opposition and Plaintiff filed a reply.
 
Legal Standard
 
Demurrer to Answer
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading
alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants,
Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) The court assumes the truth
of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.) The only issue a demurrer is
concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of
action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
A demurrer to an answer may be brought on one of three
grounds: (1) the answer does not include facts sufficient to constitute a
defense; (2) uncertainty; and (3) the facts, as pleaded, are insufficient to
determine whether an alleged contract in the answer is written or
oral. Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20. 
 
Defenses should be relevant to a plaintiff’s legal claims
and averred carefully, and with as much detail as the facts constituting the
corresponding causes of action in the complaint.  FPI Development, Inc.
v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 384 (FPI Development). They
should not be proffered in the form of “terse legal conclusions.” (Ibid.)
             
Motion to Strike
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436(a).) The
court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 436(b).) The grounds for a motion to strike are that the
pleading has irrelevant, false or improper matter, or has not been drawn or
filed in conformity with laws. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436.) The grounds for moving
to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437.)
 
Discussion
 
Demurrer
        
“The answer to a complaint shall
contain: (1) [t]he general or specific denial of the material allegations of
the complaint controverted by the defendant … [and] (2) [a] statement of any
new matter constituting a defense.” (Code Civ. Proc., 431.30, subd. (b).)
 
“The defenses shall be separately
stated, and the several defenses shall refer to the causes of action which they
are intended to answer, in a manner by which they may be intelligibly
distinguished.” (Code Civ. Proc., 431.30, subd. (g).)
 
“The phrase ‘new matter’ refers to
something relied on by a defendant which is not put in issue by the plaintiff.”
(State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1991) 228 Cal.App.3d
721, 725.) “A plea controverting the original cause of action and tendering no
new issue is a mere traverse and cannot be properly described as a plea setting
up new matter.” (Rancho Santa Margarita v. Vail (1938) 11 Cal.2d 501,
543.)
 
“However, [n]o error or defect in a
pleading is to be regarded unless it affects substantial rights …. The primary
function of a pleading is to give the other party notice so that it may prepare
its case …, and a defect in a pleading that otherwise properly notifies a party
cannot be said to affect substantial rights. (Harris v. City of Santa Monica
(2013) 56 Cal.4th 203, 240 [internal citations and quotation marks omitted].)
 
Plaintiff argues that Watts’s
answer improperly fails to state which claim each affirmative defense applies
to. This issue can be resolved with a simple interrogatory, and therefore does
not affect Plaintiff’s substantial rights.
 
However, a number of Watts’s
affirmative defenses fail to allege outside material, and are simply restated
denials of the FAC’s allegations. The Court sustains the demurrer to the
following affirmative defenses on this basis: 1, 6, 7, 26.
 
Other affirmative defenses fail to
state even basic facts in support of their contentions. On this basis, the
Court sustains the demurrer to the following affirmative defenses: 13, 14, 16,
17, 18, 19, 21.
 
Motion to Strike
 
Plaintiff moves to strike Watts’s prayer for attorney’s fees
in his answer.
 
“Affirmative relief may not be claimed in the answer.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 431.30, subd. (c).)
 
The Court therefore grants the motion to strike.  This will not, however, affect Watts’s rights
to attorney’s fees under Government Code section 12965, subdivision (c)(6), if
such fees are otherwise appropriate.
