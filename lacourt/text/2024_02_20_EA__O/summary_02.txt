The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case. The Plaintiff is requested to file a proposed judgment. The Defendant's answer largely admits to the allegations related to the agreement and modifications, but denies allegations related to the Plaintiff's performance on the Loan and the Defendants' alleged default. The Plaintiff is seeking a total judgment of $3,298,303.13, which includes the principal sum of $3,000,000.00, plus interest, late fees, and attorney's fees. The Judge notes that the Fifth Modification to the Loan agreement contains a "Continuing Validity" provision, which means that the terms of the original obligations remain unchanged and in full force and effect.
