Background
 
This case
arises from the breach of a promissory note. Plaintiff alleges the following
against Defendants: On 2/25/2020, Defendants borrowed $2 million from Plaintiff
for real estate business capital needs with a maturity date of 2/21/2021
(“Note”). The Note included interest and late charges. The parties entered into
five modifications, whereby, among other things, the maturity date of the loan
was extended, and the loan amount was changed. Defendants have defaulted on the
Note, resulting in damages of $3 million in principal owed; accrued interest at
the Note Rate of $48,854.17; plus $44,666.67 at the Default Rate; late charges
$5,296.88; and attorney fees and costs. 
 
On July 20,
2023, Plaintiff filed suit against Defendants. 
 
On September
20, 2024, Defendants NAUM NEIL SHEKHTER AND MARGOT SHEKHTER filed their answer.[2]

 
On December
4, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant summary judgment motion. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
The law of summary judgment provides courts “a mechanism
to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite
their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” 
(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826,
843 (Aguilar).)  In reviewing a motion for summary judgment,
courts employ a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues framed by the
pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent’s
claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence
of a triable, material factual issue.”  (Hinesley
v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289,
294.) “The motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers
submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)   
 
A moving
defendant bears the initial burden of production to show that one or more
elements of the cause of action cannot be established or that there is a
complete defense to the cause of action, at which point the burden shifts to
the plaintiff to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a
triable issue.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) “The motion shall be supported by affidavits,
declarations, admissions, answers to interrogatories, depositions, and matters
of which judicial notice shall or may be taken. The supporting papers shall
include a separate statement setting forth plainly and concisely all material
facts that the moving party contends are undisputed. Each of the material facts
stated shall be followed by a reference to the supporting evidence. The failure
to comply with this requirement of a separate statement may in the court’s
discretion constitute a sufficient ground for denying the motion.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (b)(1).) 
 
The opposing
party may not rely on the mere allegations or denials of the pleadings, but
instead must set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue exists
as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.  (Aguilar, supra,
at p. 849.) Specifically, “[t]he
opposition, where appropriate, shall consist of affidavits, declarations,
admissions, answers to interrogatories, depositions, and matters of which
judicial notice shall or may be taken.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subd. (2).) 
 

Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the
party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in
favor of that party.”  (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006)
39 Cal.4th 384, 389; see also Hinesley, supra, 135
Cal.App.4th at p. 294 [The court must “view the evidence in the light most
favorable to the opposing party and accept all inferences reasonably drawn
therefrom.”].)  In determining whether
the papers show that there is a triable issue as to any material fact, the
court shall consider all of the evidence set forth in the moving papers, except
that as to which objections have been made and sustained, and all inferences
reasonable deducible from such evidence. (Hayman v. Block (1986)
176 Cal.App.3d 629, 639.)

 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff
moves for summary judgment on its sole COA for breach of the Note/contract seeking
judgment in the total sum of the unpaid principal plus interest and late fees.[3] 
 
Plaintiff
argues that Defendants have breached the Loan documents (referencing the
multiple modifications) “by failing to make the payments due for June 11,
2023.” (Motion p. 3:14-15, emphasis added.) 
 
The Fifth
Modification, entitled ‘Change in Terms Agreement,’ was entered on 5/11/23. (See
Complaint, Ex. 7, p.39 of 46 of PDF; see also ‘APPENDIX OF EXHIBITS IN SUPPORT
OF PREFERRED BANK'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT,’ Ex. 7, p. 32 of 59 of PDF.)[4]
Specifically, the clause that references the June 11, 2023 date provides as
follows:
 
DESCRIPTION OF CHANGE IN TERMS. 
1) Maturity Date. The Maturity Date of
the Note is hereby changed from November 2, 2023 to May 11, 2026. 
2) Principal Amount. The Principal
Balance of the Note, $3,000,000.00 is termed out. 
3) The Payment is changed as detailed
within the "PAYMENT" paragraph below. 4) The Payment due date is
changed as detailed within the "PAYMENT" paragraph below. 
5) Effective May 11, 2023, the Interest
Rate is changed as detailed within the "VARIABLE INTEREST RATE"
paragraph below All other terms and conditions of the Note and all related
documents shall remain unchanged
 
PAYMENT. Borrower will pay this loan in 35 principal payments of
$83,333.33 each and one final principal and Interest payment of $83,941.09. Borrower's
first principal payment is due June 11, 2023, and all subsequent
principal payments are due on the same day of each month after that. In
addition, Borrower will pay regular monthly payments of all accrued unpaid
Interest due as of each payment date, beginning June 11, 2023, with all
subsequent interest payments to be due on the same day of each month after that.
Borrower’s final payment due May 11, 2026 will be for all principal and all
accrued Interest not yet paid. (emphasis and underline added). 
 
In
conjunction with the foregoing provision, the original loan agreement provides
that Defendants default on the loan should they “fail[] to make any
payment when due under the Loan.” (Exhibit List, Ex. 2, p. 8 of 59 of PDF.)
Upon default, “at Lender's option, all Indebtedness immediately will become due
and payable.” (Ibid.) Consequently, as the first payment under the Fifth
Modification was due 6/11/23 and Defendants failed to make said payments, they
defaulted on the Loan, rendering the entire principal now due. 
 
With that, the court finds that Plaintiff has met its
evidentiary burden to show that there are no triable issues of material fact as
to the breach of contract claim. Though the burden should shift to Defendants,
Defendants have not filed an opposition and any attempt to do so one court date
before the hearing would be grossly untimely. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, the motion is granted.
