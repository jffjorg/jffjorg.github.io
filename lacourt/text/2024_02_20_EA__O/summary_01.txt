And here is a summary in English text:

The court's tentative ruling grants Preferred Bank's motion for summary judgment against Naum Neil Shekhter and Margot Shekhter, the defendants. The case arises from the breach of a promissory note, where Preferred Bank loaned $2 million to the defendants for real estate business capital needs with a maturity date of 2/21/2021. The loan was modified five times, and the defendants defaulted on the loan. Preferred Bank alleges that the defendants breached the loan documents by failing to make payments due, resulting in damages of $3 million in principal owed, interest, and late charges.

The court finds that Preferred Bank has met its evidentiary burden to show that there are no triable issues of material fact as to the breach of contract claim. The defendants have failed to file an opposition to the motion, and any attempt to do so would be grossly untimely. Therefore, the motion is granted, and Preferred Bank is entitled to a judgment in the total sum of the unpaid principal plus interest and late fees.
