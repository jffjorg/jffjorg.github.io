And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Wintrust Specialty Finance v. Reyes Express International, Inc. et al. regarding the plaintiff's unopposed applications for a writ of possession. The court grants the applications and finds that the plaintiff has established the probable validity of its claim to possession of a 2019 ISU TB (Serial No. JALC4W161K7009029). The court also orders a turnover under CCP § 512.070, which requires the plaintiff to post an undertaking in the amount of $11,120.96. The court strikes a portion of the proposed orders that attempts to establish probable cause that the equipment is located at an unknown location, as the plaintiff has not demonstrated probable cause that the equipment is at any location other than the address specified in the Equipment Finance Agreement, namely, 1243 Alvarado Street, Suite C1, Los Angeles, CA 90006-4178.
