Case:                           Mark Williams v.
Noreen McClendon (23STCP01687)
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Petitioner Mark Williams’ Motion to Compel Nonparty Los
Angeles Unified School District to Comply with Plaintiff Subpoena is DENIED. 
 
Los Angeles Unified School District’s request for judicial
notice as to Exhibit A is GRANTED, pursuant to Evidence Code § 452(d). The
other requests are DENIED as “unnecessary to the resolution” of the issues
before the Court. (Martinez v. San Diego County Credit Union (2020) 50
Cal.App.5th 1048, 1075.) 
 
Petitioner Mark Williams moves to compel compliance with a
subpoena duces tecum directed to Los Angeles Unified School District (“LAUSD”),
wherein petitioner requested the technical evaluation of the Carver Middle
School Artificial Turf Soccer Field Joint Use Agreement between the Los Angeles
School District and Concerned Citizens of South Central Los Angeles. (See Motion
Ex. 9.) 
 
LAUSD first opposes the motion on the ground that it did not
consent to electronic service of the motion. (See Proof of Service [LAUSD
counsel served by email on 10/16/24].) However, as a “represented litigant,” it
is required to electronically file documents with the Court. (11/5/18 General
Order Re Mandatory Electronically Filing for Civil at subd. (b)(1).) “[A] party
or other person that is required to file documents electronically in an
action must also serve documents and accept service of documents electronically
from all other parties or persons, unless: [¶] (A)  The court orders otherwise, or [¶] (B) The
action includes parties or persons that are not required to file or serve
documents electronically, including self-represented parties or other
self-represented persons; those parties or other persons are to be served by
non-electronic methods unless they affirmatively consent to electronic
service.” (Rule of Court 2.251(c)(3).) Because LAUSD is represented and
required to file documents electronically with the Court, it must also accept
electronic service of documents. 
 
LAUSD next argues that, even if electronic service was
proper, electronic filing and service of the motion was untimely. Based on the
hearing date of 11/7/24, the deadline to file the motion was 10/16/24 and the
deadline to electronically serve the motion was 10/14/24. (CCP §§ 1005(b) [16
court days to file motion], 1010.6(a)(3)(B) [two court days added for
electronic service].) Petitioner untimely filed the motion on 10/17/24 and untimely
served the motion electronically on 10/16/24. However, because LAUSD addresses
the merits of the motion, the Court proceeds to rule on the merits. Contrary to
LAUSD’s contention, the service and filing deadlines are not “discovery
deadlines,” which have been treated as jurisdictional. (See Sexton v.
Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410 [discussing 45-day deadline
under predecessor to CCP §§ 2030.300(c), 2031.310(c).) 
 
As the Court ruled on 9/19/24 (RJN Ex. A), petitioner does
not dispute LAUSD’s assertion that the requested technical evaluation is the
result of an investigation by the Inspector General. Education Code § 35401(c)
provides: “Every investigation, including, but not limited to, all
investigative files and work-product, shall be kept confidential, except that
the inspector general may issue any report of an investigation that has been
substantiated, keeping confidential the identity of the individual or individuals
involved, or release any findings resulting from an investigation conducted
pursuant to this article that is deemed necessary to serve the interests of the
district.” The statute expressly provides that every investigation, including
the underlying investigative files, are confidential. Therefore, plaintiff does
not have a right to discover the report. (See Office of Inspector General v.
Superior Court (2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 695, 705 [report held as confidential
under statute is not subject to disclosure under California Public Records
Act].) While the statute provides that the Inspector General may issue and
release any report of an investigation, the statute does not require the
Inspector General to do so. LAUSD cannot produce any investigative report that
is within the discretion of the Inspector General to produce. No argument
asserted by petitioner in the instant motion changes this conclusion. 
 
The motion is DENIED.
