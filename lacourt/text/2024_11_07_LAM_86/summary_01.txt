And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel nonparty Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) to comply with a subpoena duces tecum directed by Plaintiff Mark Williams. The motion is DENIED. LAUSD had objected to the motion on the grounds that it did not consent to electronic service of the motion and that the service and filing deadlines were untimely. However, the Judge ruled that LAUSD, as a represented litigant, is required to electronically file documents with the Court and accept electronic service of documents. The Judge also noted that LAUSD's contention that the requested technical evaluation is confidential is supported by Education Code § 35401(c), which provides that every investigation, including underlying investigative files, are confidential. The Judge concluded that Plaintiff does not have a right to discover the requested technical evaluation, and therefore, the motion is DENIED.
