Ruling
Roth
v. Arakelian Enterprises, Inc., et al., Case No. 22SMCV01418
Hearing
Date:  May 2, 2024
Plaintiff
Roth’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production
 
Plaintiff
Roth alleges a sanitation vehicle driven by an employee of defendant Arakelian
Enterprises, Inc. struck and damaged his car. On June 13, 2023 Roth served
requests for production of
documents. On December 13, 2023, the court granted plaintiff’s motion to compel
further responses. On March 4, 2024, plaintiff filed a motion to compel further
responses, arguing Arakelian’s further responses were insufficient and
contained improper objections.
 
Request 2
The court ordered Arakelian to
provide further responses without objections to this request. See Code Civ.
Proc. §2031.300(a) [objections must be asserted by due date of original
responses or else the objections are waived]. Arakelian’s further response contains
improper objections. Also, Arakelian indicated in its response to plaintiff’s Special
Interrogatory Number 3 that there were a few emails between Mariangela
Caraballo and Emily Harvey of the Boys and Girls Club on September 30, 2021.
GRANTED to the extent the unproduced responsive emails exist.
 
Request 4
Request 4 is for plaintiff’s special
interrogatory number 4, not a request for production, and is outside the scope
of this motion. DENIED.
 
Requests 16-17
Arakelian improperly asserted only
objections in response to these requests, violating the court’s December 13,
2023 order. GRANTED.
 
Requests 5-6, 13-15, 19-20, 24
While Arakelian improperly asserted
objections to these requests, the Court otherwise finds Arakelian’s responses
sufficient since they either provided documents or stated an inability to
comply following a diligent search. DENIED.
 
Arakelian to produce further
documents, without objection, in accordance with the rulings above within 20
days or, if no further documents exist, provide a verified statement that a
diligent search has been conducted.
 
Monetary Sanctions
The court DENIES plaintiff’s request
for monetary sanctions, finding the imposition of sanctions would be unjust.
See Code Civ. Proc., §§2023.050(c), 2031.300(c).
