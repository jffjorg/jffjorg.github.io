And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Edward Bass Films, to the plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint. The plaintiff, Jane Doe, alleges that the defendant raped her in 2021 when she was 17. The defendant argues that the complaint is uncertain and fails to state a cause of action. The judge agrees that the complaint is unclear and fails to provide specific factual allegations for each cause of action. The judge orders the plaintiff to amend the complaint to provide more specific facts. The defendant also requests judicial notice of certain documents and allegations, but the judge denies this request as the defendant has not cited any statute or basis for these documents to be judicially noticed.
