Paul J. Cohen v. Michael Kaplan, et al., Case No.
20SMCV01214 
Hearing date May 2, 2024 
Cross-Defendant Bloch’s Special Motion to Strike Third
Amended Cross-Complaint 
Plaintiffs
Cohen sued defendants Kaplan and Johnson for quiet title and trespass related
to property in Malibu. (Complaint ¶ 2.) Defendant Kaplan cross-complained on
April 1, 2021 for prescriptive easement, adverse possession and added claims
against Sotheby’s International. On July 5, 2023 the parties represented to the
court that a settlement agreement had been signed.
On
December 20, 2023 this court denied Kaplan’s motion to enforce settlement on
the grounds that Elaine Cohen had not signed the agreement. Kaplan filed a
Third Amended Cross-Complaint (TACC) on January 26, 2024, adding claims for
breach of settlement agreement, negligent misrepresentation and fraud against
the Cohens and their attorney, cross-defendant Bloch.
On
March 12, 2024 this court sustained the Cohens’ demurrer to the claims for
breach of settlement and estoppel in the TACC with leave to amend. The court
also granted sanctions to Kaplan against attorney Bloch for his failure to
disclose that Elaine Cohen had not signed the settlement agreement. Bloch now brings
this anti-SLAPP motion against the TACC.
In
ruling on an anti-SLAPP motion, a trial court uses a “summary-judgment-like
procedure at any early stage of the litigation.” Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino (2005) 35 Cal.4th 180, 192.
This two-step process first requires defendant to show the acts of which the
plaintiff complains were taken “in furtherance of the [defendant]’s right of
petition or free speech under the United States of California Constitution in
connection with a public issue.” Code Civ. Proc. §425.16(b)(1). If defendant
carries that burden, the burden shift to plaintiff to demonstrate a probability
of prevailing on the claim. Code Civ. Proc. §425.16(b)(3). In making both
determinations the trial court considers “the pleadings, and supporting and
opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is
based.” Code Civ. Proc. §425.16(b)(2); Equilon
Enterprises v. Consumer Cause (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 67.
 
Bloch
moves to strike the negligent misrepresentation claim, arising from his
representations in May 2023 that the Cohen plaintiffs both signed the
settlement agreement, when in fact Elaine Cohen had not (TACC ¶¶ 77–78). Bloch argues
these allegations arise from protected litigation-related activity — i.e.
settlement negotiations — and any claim based upon them is barred by the
litigation privilege. 
 
a.      Protected Activity
 
The
anti-SLAPP statute defines protected activities as: “(1) any written or oral
statement or writing made before a legislative, executive, or judicial
proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law, (2) any written
or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration
or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other official
proceeding authorized by law…” Code Civ. Proc. §425.16(e).
 
Courts “have adopted a fairly expansive view of what constitutes
litigation-related activities within the scope of section 425.16.” Kashian
v. Harriman (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 892, 908. “Correspondence made in
anticipation of litigation “contemplated in good faith and under serious
consideration can be a petitioning activity protected by the anti-SLAPP
statute.” Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez
(2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 472. Defendant bears the burden of making this
initial showing. See, e.g., Navellier v.
Sletten (2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 88. Communications related to settlement
negotiations have been held to constitute protected activity. Optional Capital, Inc. v. Akin Gump Strauss,
Hauer & Feld LLP (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 95, 114 [“[B]ecause
settlement negotiations are regarded as an exercise of the right to petition,
communications during such negotiations are regarded as having been made in
connection with the underlying lawsuit for purposes of section 425.16,
subdivision (e)(2).”].
 
Kaplan argues the
motion is moot, as all causes of action against Bloch were dismissed. A notice
of dismissal was filed February 9, 2024, stating the following causes of action
were dismissed without prejudice: “Third Amended Cross-Complaint causes of
action 4 (Fraud), 5 (Conspiracy), 7 (Negl. Misrep.) only.” (See 2/9/2024
dismissal.) 
 
This dismissal is
ambiguous as to the status of the negligent misrepresentation claim alleged
against Bloch in the TACC because there are two negligent misrepresentation
claims alleged, neither of which is the seventh cause of action. The cause of
action alleged against Bloch is labeled the sixth cause of action for negligent
misrepresentation, and another claim labeled the fourth cause of action for
negligent misrepresentation is alleged against Sotheby’s and other
cross-defendants. TACC at pp. 17, 21. Adding to the confusion are the existence
of duplicative “sixth” and “fourth” causes of action— one for false advertising
and one for fraud (which has been dismissed) — and two “seventh” causes of
action, one for estoppel and one for unfair competition. TACC at pp. 18, 24. 
 
Bloch sent an
email to Kaplan’s counsel on February 15, 2024, calling the TACC a “poorly
drafted pile of feathers,” asking counsel whether he was “intoxicated when you
drafted and filed this?” and seeking filing of “an additional dismissal in this
matter, which dismisses the sixth cause of action for negligent
misrepresentation against me and the Cohens, and makes clear I am completely
dismissed from the TACC.” Zuidema Decl., Exh. K. 
 
Kaplan’s counsel
responded, “it is clear that the tort claims (which are the only claims
involving you) have been dismissed without prejudice. . . . If there is any
confusion regarding which claims were dismissed, we can address it on March 8
at the hearing and will follow the Court’s direction and guidance on the issue if
any further actions are needed.” Id.
 
On March 12, 2024
the court heard the Cohens’ motion to strike the fourth, fifth and sixth causes
of action for fraud, conspiracy and negligent misrepresentation, granting the
motion based on litigation privilege and directing that a fourth amended
cross-complaint was to omit such claims. See 3/12/2024 Minute Order at
p. 3.
 
Timely
dismissal of protected claims renders a pending anti-SLAPP motion moot. Catlin Ins. Co., Inc. v. Danko Meredith Law Firm, Inc. (2022) 73 Cal.App.5th 764, 774 [“After Catlin's voluntary dismissal, the request to decide the anti-SLAPP
motion was moot;
the trial court could not strike a complaint that Catlin had already
voluntarily dismissed.”]. 
Here, the February 9, 2024 notice of dismissal does not address
the sixth cause of action for negligent misrepresentation, and the confused
nature of the TACC renders the dismissal unclear. Rather than enter a
clarifying dismissal either in response to Bloch’s email or this motion, Kaplan
elected to stand on the defective February 9 notice, arguing in opposition to
this motion that the negligent misrepresentation claim is, in fact, legally
sufficient. Opposition at pp. 9–10. Because the fault for any ambiguity lies
with Kaplan, and because this court already entered an order directing that the
claim be struck, the motion is not moot, and the court may proceed to the
second prong of the anti-SLAPP analysis.
b.      Likelihood
of Prevailing
After a defendant
meets the burden of showing the gravamen of the complaint involves protected
activity, plaintiff must “demonstrate that the complaint is both legally
sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to
sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is
credited.” Matson v. Dvorak (1995) 40
Cal.App.4th 539, 548. A defendant meets the burden by establishing plaintiff
cannot overcome an affirmative defense. Birkner
v. Lam (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 275, 285. 
“[A]
plaintiff cannot simply rely on his or her pleadings, even if verified. Rather,
the plaintiff must adduce competent, admissible evidence.” Grenier v. Taylor
(2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 471, 480. “Legally
sufficient” means the cause of action would satisfy demurrer. Dowling v. Zimmerman (2001) 85
Cal.App.4th 1400, 1421. The evidentiary showing must be made by competent and
admissible evidence. Morrow v. Los
Angeles Unified School Dist. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 1424, 1444. The
question is whether plaintiff presented evidence that, if believed by the trier
of fact, is sufficient to support a judgment in plaintiff’s favor. Zamos v. Stroud (2004) 32 Cal.4th 958,
965.
The motion hinges on application of the litigation privilege in Civil
Code §47. “The usual formulation is that the privilege applies to any
communication (1) made in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by
litigants or other participants authorized by law; (3) to achieve the objects
of the litigation; and (4) that have some connection or logical relation to the
action.” Silberg v. Anderson (1990)
50 Cal.3d 205, 212. “[T]he litigation privilege bars all tort causes of action
except malicious prosecution.” Jacob B.
v. County of Shasta (2007) 40 Cal.4th 948, 960. Otherwise, the privilege
“is absolute and applies regardless of malice.” Id. at 955.
Kaplan’s negligent misrepresentation claim is
precluded by the litigation privilege because it concerns settlement
communications made in judicial proceedings by attorneys authorized by law to
participate in those proceedings, designed to achieve the objects of the
litigation and directly connected thereto. “Numerous
courts have held that statements relating to settlements also fall within the
[litigation] privilege, including those made during settlement negotiations.” Bonni
v. St. Joseph Health System (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 288, 304.
Kaplan’s sole argument contesting application of the privilege is
the contention that it does not apply in cases of “extrinsic fraud.” Opposition
at p. 9. But the authority Kaplan relies on does not identify an “extrinsic
fraud” exception to the litigation privilege; it recognizes an “extrinsic
fraud” exception to the presumption of the finality of judgments. Silberg,
supra, 50 Cal.3d at 214 [“To allow a litigant to attack the integrity of
evidence after the proceedings have concluded, except in the most narrowly
circumscribed situations, such as extrinsic fraud, would impermissibly burden,
if not inundate, our justice system.”].) 
Numerous courts recognized that while extrinsic fraud may form a
basis “to seek equitable relief from the judgment” so entered, “a tort remedy
is precluded by the litigation privilege.” Bonni, supra,   83
Cal.App.5th at p. 304; see Weeden v. Hoffman (2021) 70
Cal.App.5th 269, 290 [same];  Herterich
v. Peltner (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 1132, 1147 [holding tort claim alleging
extrinsic fraud to be barred by the litigation privilege].) Kaplan’s claim is
legally deficient. GRANTED.
