Here is a summary of the document in English text:

The tentative ruling is regarding an anti-SLAPP motion filed by Bloch, the attorney for the Cohen plaintiffs, to strike the negligent misrepresentation claim against him. Bloch argues that the claim arises from protected litigation-related activity, specifically settlement negotiations. The court finds that the litigation privilege applies to the claim, precluding the tort claim. The court also finds that the claim is legally insufficient and not supported by sufficient evidence. The court grants the anti-SLAPP motion.
