The judge's tentative ruling continues the hearing to June 18, 2024, due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with court orders. The plaintiff had filed an amended petition on April 18, 2024, but failed to serve notice to the required agencies and lodge the petition with the Probate Division. The court had previously ordered the plaintiff to amend the petition and lodge it with the Probate Division at least 30 days before the hearing. The plaintiff also filed a motion to seal documents without a court order permitting sealing. The court will consider the application to seal prior to the continued hearing date.
