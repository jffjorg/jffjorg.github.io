[TENTATIVE] ORDER
GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR ISSUE, EVIDENTIARY, MONETARY AND/OR TERMINING
SANCTIONS FOR DEFENDANT’S FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE COURT’S JANUARY 9, 2024, ORDER
RE PLAINTIFF’S SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE 
 
I.       
BACKGROUND
       The
complaint alleges that Defendant issued a written express warranty to
Plaintiffs in connection with Plaintiffs’ lease of a 2022 Kia Nero-EV. The
vehicle developed electrical and other defects. Defendant allegedly failed to
fulfill its statutory duties under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act
(“SBA”).
       The Court’s
file indicates that a Plaintiff has filed a motion for issue and other
sanctions for Defendant’s continued failure to provide responses to special
interrogatories, set one. 
 
II.     
ARGUMENTS
       Plaintiffs’
motion filed April 2, 2024, argues that on January 9, 2024, the Court ordered
Defendant to serve further responses to special interrogatories by February 8,
2024. Defendant has historically engaged in delaying tactics and willfully
fails and refuses to comply with the Court’s orders. Defendant failed to comply
with the January 9, 2024, order although the Court granted Defendant’s request
at the hearing to allow 30 days for Defendant to respond. The Court should
strike Defendant’s answer. Plaintiffs also request monetary sanctions and issue
sanctions establishing Defendant had knowledge of the defects and that the
defects were not repairable. Evidentiary sanctions may also be appropriate. 
       In
opposition filed April 17, 2024, Defendant argues that that the parties agreed
to settlement with Defendant’s repurchase of the vehicle. The settlement has
not been finalized. If the matter is not settled, Defendant intends to comply
with the November 16, 2023, order to produce additional documents. Defendant
argues that it has not been able to complete searches and produce documents
because of the breadth of the document request. The court should extend the
production date to May 14, 2024. 
       In
reply, Plaintiffs assert that the trial date is in less than three months, and
Defendant has not provided responses. Plaintiffs object to defense counsel’s
declaration.  
III.   
LEGAL STANDARDS
       Discovery
sanctions are not to be imposed for punishment, but instead are used to
encourage fair disclosure of discovery to prevent unfairness resulting from the
lack of information. (Midwife v. Bernal (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d
57, 64.) The type of sanction imposed should be “appropriate to the
dereliction,” and tailored to accomplish the discovery sought. (Do It Urself Moving &
Storage, Inc. v. Brown, Leifer, Slatkin & Berns (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 27, 35.)
There are two prerequisites for the imposition of a discovery sanction: “(1)
there must be a failure to comply [with a valid discovery order] . . . and (2)
the failure must be willful.” (Young v.
Rosenthal (1989) 212 Cal. App. 3d
96, 114.)
       Abuses of the discovery process include employing
a discovery method that causes unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or
oppression, or undue burden and expense; making unmeritorious objections or
evasive responses to discovery; and failing to meet and confer in good faith.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)
       Defendant’s opposition does not discuss
the discovery order at issue which required a further response to special
interrogatories, set one. Defendant’s opposition addresses its failure to comply
with the Court’s November 16, 2023, order for production of documents. Accordingly,
the Court SUSTAINS all of Plaintiffs’ evidentiary objections as the Jordan
Pratty declaration is irrelevant. 
       Defendant has not shown any justification
for failure to comply with its order of January 9. Defendant’s willful failure
to comply with its discovery obligations and the Court’s orders are
established. Plaintiff was required to file motions to compel Defendant’s
cooperation in discovery as follows:



Compel
  Defendant’s further Responses to request for production of documents set two


2/29/24




Compel
  Defendant’s Compliance to Order Re: request for production of documents, set
  one; 


12/19/23




Compel
  Defendant’s Further Responses to Special interrogatories, Set One


11/13/23




Compel
  Defendant’s further responses to request for production of documents, set one
  


10/20/23



 
       Defendant’s recalcitrance in responding
to discovery and complying with court orders is further established, as
Plaintiffs have been required to file other motions for terminating and other
sanctions set to be heard on May 7, 2024, and May 16, 2024, for failing to
comply with court orders. Plaintiffs served the special interrogatories at
issue on March 3, 2023. Defendant has not complied with the Court’s order to
provide responses, and trial is currently set for July 1, 2024.
       Based on the foregoing, issue sanctions
are warranted for costs and fees required to establish the discrete issues
against Defendant as outlined in the motion. (Mot. 9:24 – 10:3.) Evidentiary
sanctions in the form outlined in Plaintiffs’ motion are warranted given that Plaintiffs
have not been able to prepare for trial for over a year. (Mot. 12:3 – 13:9.)
       Monetary sanctions are also warranted for
Defendant’s abuse of the discovery process. The Court finds that Plaintiffs'
counsel’s hourly rate of $375.00 per hour is reasonable. Plaintiffs’ counsel’s
representations regarding the amount of time spent preparing and arguing the
motion are also reasonable.  
IV.   
CONCLUSION
       Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs’
motion for issue and evidentiary sanctions is GRANTED. The Court imposes sanctions
of $4,312.50 per hour plus the cost to file the motion. Defendant Kia America,
Inc. is ordered to pay monetary sanctions to Plaintiffs within 10 days.
