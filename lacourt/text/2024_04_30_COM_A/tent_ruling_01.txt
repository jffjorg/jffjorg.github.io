  Case Number:  19STCV03192    Hearing Date:   April 30, 2024    Dept:  A 19STCV03192 Apolonio
 Garcia, by and through his Guardian ad Litem, Rafael Garcia v. Antonio Uribe
 Caracheo, et al.
Tuesday,
 April 30, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER 
 
       This
action arises from a December 14, 2018, incident wherein Defendant, Antonio
Uribe Caracheo, while driving a tractor trailer with the consent of Lincoln
Transportation Services, Inc.  struck
Plaintiff resulting in disabling injuries.
       At the
last hearing on March 21, 2024, regarding the Plaintiff’s requested approval for
distributing net settlement funds to a pooled trust, the Court ordered
Plaintiff to amend the petition correcting the defects identified and lodge the
trust instrument with the Probate Division at least 30 days before the hearing.
Plaintiff filed an amended and redacted petition on April 18, 2024, less than
30 days before the continued hearing date, which is insufficient time for
either the court or the Probate Division to consider the amended petition and
the terms of the proposed trust.     
       As the
net settlement funds are proposed to be deposited into a pooled trust, notice
of the hearing and service of the petition must be made upon three state
agencies including the Dept. of Mental Health, Dept. of Developmental Services,
and Dept. of Health Care Services. 
(Probate Code sections 3602(f), 3611(c).)  The proof of service attached to the petition
does not indicate such service was made. 
       Contrary
to the Court’s March 21, 2024, order, Plaintiff filed the amended petition
without a court order permitting sealing of documents. Plaintiff filed the
motion to seal three court days before the hearing, and after Plaintiff filed
the amended petition. 
       Based
on the foregoing, the Court continues the hearing to June 18, 2024, at 8:30
a.m. in Department A of the Compton Courthouse. Plaintiff is required to serve
notice to the appropriate agencies identified above and to lodge the amended
and unredacted petition with both this Court and the Probate Division. The
Court will consider the application to seal prior to the continued hearing
date.
