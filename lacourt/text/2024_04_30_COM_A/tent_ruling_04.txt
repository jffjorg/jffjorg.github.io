[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S
 MOTION FOR ENTRY OF JUDGMENT PURSUANT TO SETTLEMENT 
 
       
       The first
amended complaint alleges that Plaintiff agreed to provide abatement services
to Defendants pursuant to a written contract. Defendants failed to pay
$29,861.59. The parties settled this case on December 18, 2023. 
       Plaintiff moves
to enforce the terms of the parties written settlement agreement. Plaintiff
served Defendants with the motion on March 14, 2024. Defendants did not file an
opposition.
       A party can move for entry of judgment
pursuant to the terms of the settlement. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 664.6.) The court’s power is limited to
determining the existence of the agreement and to enforce its settlement. (Corkland
v. Boscoe (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 989, 994.) The court
may receive oral testimony or may determine the motion upon declarations alone.
(Id.) 
       Plaintiff
submits the parties’ settlement agreement signed on December 12, 2023. (Adam
Lieber decl., Ex. 1.). Defendants agreed to pay $30,000 to Plaintiff. (Id.,
¶ 3.a.) Defendants failed to make the agreed payment.
(Lieber decl., ¶ 6.) The parties agreed that the court may enforce the terms of
settlement in the event of a breach. (Id., Ex.
1, ¶ 10.) 
       Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED. The court enters judgment pursuant to the terms
of the settlement agreement. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.)
