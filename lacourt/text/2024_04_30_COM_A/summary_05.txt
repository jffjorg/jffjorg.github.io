Here is a brief summary in English:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion to compel arbitration in the case brought by Mayra Castaneda and others against Prime Healthcare and others. The plaintiffs, healthcare workers, allege that they were retaliated against by being terminated from their employment after they complained about unlawful employment practices. The defendants argue that the dispute should be resolved through arbitration, as the plaintiffs signed agreements to arbitrate any disputes arising out of their employment. The court finds that the arbitration agreement is enforceable and grants the defendants' motion. The case is stayed pending the completion of the arbitration.
