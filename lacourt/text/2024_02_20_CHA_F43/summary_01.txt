And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a special motion to strike a cross-complaint filed by Road Runner Land & Homes, LLC against DeWelt, LLC. The motion was filed under California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) ยง 425.16, which provides for an anti-SLAPP motion. The Court has denied the motion, finding that the cross-complaint does not arise from protected activity under the anti-SLAPP statute.

The Court concluded that the cross-complaint is not a petitioning activity, but rather arises from the same transaction or occurrence as the original complaint. The Court also found that neither of Road Runner's causes of action, cancellation of instrument and conversion, affect or challenge DeWelt's ability to petition the Court.

DeWelt argued that Road Runner does not have standing to bring the cross-complaint, but the Court ruled that standing is not a proper subject for an anti-SLAPP motion and is unrelated to the merits of the action. The Court denied the motion, finding that DeWelt failed to meet its burden for the first step of the anti-SLAPP motion.
