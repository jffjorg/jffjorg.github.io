[1] A party’s contentions are waived when a
party fails to support them with reasoned argument and citations to
authority.  (Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v. Colombo (2003) 111
Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215.)  


[2]
Moving Defendant served subpoenas on four entities that are related to
Outfront.  These subpoenas are the
subjects of pending motions to compel that are scheduled to be heard in May
2024.


[3]
Although Moving Defendant contends that Outfront waived any objections to the
Subpoena by failing to timely object or respond, the Motion cites to no
authority that squarely addresses the issue of a nonparty’s waiver of
objections in circumstances where the nonparty fails to respond to a subpoena
altogether, and the Court finds the caselaw cited in the Motion inapposite to
this issue. 


[4]
Should Moving Defendant take the position that Outfront’s verified responses
are inadequate, he is not precluded from filing another motion to compel.
