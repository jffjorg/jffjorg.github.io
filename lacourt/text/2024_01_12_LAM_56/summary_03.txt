Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant, Century Towers Association (Moving Defendant), and has granted the motion as to the fourth and sixth causes of action. The fourth cause of action alleges a violation of Civil Code section 789.3, which prohibits a landlord from intentionally interrupting or terminating utility services. The judge finds that the suspensions of the plaintiff's common area privileges were not intended to terminate the plaintiff's tenancy, but rather were disciplinary responses to the plaintiff's failure to comply with the mask mandate. Therefore, the judge grants the motion with respect to the fourth cause of action.

The sixth cause of action alleges intentional infliction of emotional distress. The judge finds that Moving Defendant's decisions to suspend the plaintiff's common area privileges were not extreme or outrageous behavior, but rather were within its discretion to enforce rules imposed on the community it governs. Therefore, the judge grants the motion with respect to the sixth cause of action.

The judge notes that the moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling, and that parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court as directed by the instructions provided on the court's website.
