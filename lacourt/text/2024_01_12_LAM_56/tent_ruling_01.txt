AND RELATED
CROSS-ACTION
 
MOVING PARTY:
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Brian Kennedy (“Moving Defendant”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Nonparty
Outfront Media, Inc. (“Outfront”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers.
 
BACKGROUND
The currently
operative fifth amended complaint (the “FAC”) alleges: (1) breach of contract;
(2) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (3) breach
of fiduciary duty; (4) fraud; (5) intentional interference with contractual
relations; and (6) aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty.  
 
The cross-complaint
(the “XC”) alleges: (1) breach of fiduciary duty; (2) breach of covenant of
good faith and fair dealing; (3) misappropriation of trade secrets; (4) common
law right of publicity; (5) statutory misappropriation of name and likeness;
(6) trademark infringement; (7) intentional interference with prospective
economic relations; (8) unfair business practices; and (9) unjust enrichment.
 
On December 13,
2023, Moving Defendant filed a motion to enforce compliance with a deposition
subpoena (the “Subpoena”) for the production of documents that was served on
Outfront (the “Motion”).  
 
DISCUSSION
Under California Code of Civil Procedure
(“CCP”) section 1987.1, subdivision (a), if a subpoena requires the attendance
of a witness or the production of books, documents, electronically stored
information, or other things before a court, or at the trial of an issue
therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the court, upon motion made by any
person described in CCP section 1987.1, subdivision (b), or upon the court’s
own motion after giving counsel notice and an opportunity to be heard, may make
an order quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it or directing compliance
with it upon those terms or conditions as the court shall declare.  (CCP § 1987.1, subd. (a).)  
 
Although the statute does not explicitly
state so, a motion to compel the production of documents from a nonparty
witness requires that the moving party show good cause for the production.  (See Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v.
Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 223-24; cf. CCP §
2040.410, subd. (a).)  To establish good
cause, a discovery proponent must identify a disputed fact that is of
consequence in the action and explain how the discovery sought will tend in
reason to prove or disprove that fact or lead to other evidence that will tend
to prove or disprove the fact.  (Digital
Music News LLC v Superior Court (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 216, 224
(disapproved of on other grounds by Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3
Cal.5th 31).)  To meet this standard, a
party seeking to compel production of records from a nonparty must articulate
specific facts justifying the discovery sought; it may not rely on mere
generalities.  (Board of Registered
Nursing v. Superior Court of Orange County (2021) 59 Cal.App.5th 889,
908.)  In assessing the party's proffered
justification, courts must keep in mind the more limited scope of discovery
available from nonparties.  (Id.)
 
On September 20, 2023, Moving Defendant
served Outfront with the Subpoena. 
(Declaration of Sarah A. Swanson (“Swanson Decl.”) ¶ 4, Exhibit
2.)  The Subpoena seeks documents that
are related to a potential breach of a settlement agreement placed at issue in
the FAC and XC.  (See Swanson
Decl. ¶ 7.)  Outfront did not object
or respond to the Subpoena before the October 13, 2023 deadline.  (Swanson Decl. ¶ 4.)  Moving Defendant’s counsel contacted Outfront,
but the parties were unable to resolve the dispute before Moving Defendant
filed the Motion.  (See Swanson
Decl. ¶¶ 5-6, Exhibit 5.) 
 
In its opposition (the “Opposition”),
Outfront contends that it may have been improperly served with the Subpoena,
but it provides no evidence or argument as to why service was insufficient.[1]  Notwithstanding the propriety of service, Outfront
indicates that it was unaware of the Subpoena at issue in the Motion until
December 21, 2023, when its attorneys reviewed the Motion.  (See Declaration of Brianna Kostecka
(“Kostecka Decl.”) ¶¶ 9-10; Declaration of James Swearingen (“Swearingen
Decl.”) ¶ 8.)[2]  Outfront served objections to the Subpoena on
December 22, 2023.  (Swearingen Decl. ¶
9, Exhibit E.)  
 
As a preliminary matter, the Court finds that
Moving Defendant has demonstrated good cause for the production of documents
identified in the Subpoena.  Although
Outfront served objections on December 22, 2023, these responses are
unverified.[3]  Unverified responses are tantamount to no
responses at all.  (Appleton v.
Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)
The Court therefore GRANTS the Motion.[4]  Outfront is ordered to comply with the
Subpoena within 20 days of the date of this order. 
 
Monetary Sanctions
            In connection with the
Motion, Moving Defendant requests $9,400 in monetary sanctions.  (Swanson Decl. ¶ 8.)  This amount represents: ten hours preparing
the moving papers at a rate of $398 per hour; (2) an anticipated five hours
preparing the reply papers at a rate of $398 per hour; and (3) an anticipated
five hours preparing for the hearing at a rate of $687 per hour.  (Id.) 

 
            Given Outfront’s inadvertent
oversight regarding the Subpoena and its subsequent attempt to respond, the
Court declines to impose monetary sanctions on a nonparty at this time. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of
this ruling. 
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
