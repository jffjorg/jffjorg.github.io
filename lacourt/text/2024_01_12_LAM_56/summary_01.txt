And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling is in response to a motion to enforce compliance with a deposition subpoena served on Outfront Media, Inc. (Outfront) by defendant Brian Kennedy (Moving Defendant). The subpoena seeks documents related to a potential breach of a settlement agreement placed at issue in the FAC and XC. Outfront did not object or respond to the subpoena before the deadline, and Moving Defendant's counsel contacted Outfront but was unable to resolve the dispute before filing the motion. The Court finds that Moving Defendant has demonstrated good cause for the production of the documents and grants the motion. The Court orders Outfront to comply with the subpoena within 20 days. Outfront served objections to the subpoena, but these responses are unverified and therefore deemed ineffective. The Court declines to impose monetary sanctions on Outfront at this time.
