  JUDGMENT/ADJUDICATION
 
Date:

Time: 8:30 a.m. 
Dept. 56
Jury Trial: March 18, 2024



 
MOVING
PARTY: Defendant Century Towers Association (“Moving Defendant”)
 
The
Court has considered the moving papers. 
No opposition papers were filed. 
Any opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at
least 14 days before the hearing under California Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”)
section 437c, subdivision (b)(2).
 
BACKGROUND
This
action arises out of a landlord/tenant relationship.  The currently operative second amended
complaint (the “SAC”) alleges: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (3) violation of the Fair Employment
and Housing Act (“FEHA”); (4) violation of Civil Code section 789.3; (5) breach
of quiet enjoyment; (6) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (7)
negligence; and (8) malicious prosecution—wrongful use of civil proceeding.
 
In
relevant part, the SAC alleges: On or about May 18, 2021, Plaintiff began
leasing a unit in a building that is part of Moving Defendant’s common interest
development.  (See SAC ¶¶ 9,
12.)  In or around July 2021, Moving
Defendant issued an emergency rule mandating that residents wear masks in
common areas of the building.  (SAC ¶
13.)  Plaintiff sought a medical
exemption from the mask mandate that was denied by Moving Defendant.  (See SAC ¶¶ 20-22.)  In addition to fining Plaintiff for not
complying with the mask mandate, Moving Defendant limited Plaintiff’s access to
internet and cable services, valet parking, and the gym.  (SAC ¶¶ 25-26.)  
 
On
October 25, 2023, Moving Defendant filed a motion for summary
judgment/adjudication (the “Motion”) to the fourth and sixth causes of action on
the grounds that there are no triable issues of material fact regarding the
claims alleged against Moving Defendant and Moving Defendant is therefore
entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL
NOTICE
            Moving Defendant’s Request for Judicial Notice is GRANTED
as to the existence of the
documents and their legal effect, but not to the truth of the matters stated
therein.  (See Dominguez
v. Bonta (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 389, 400.)
 
 
 
DISCUSSION
The function of a motion for summary judgment or
adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot
show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of
summary dismissal without the need for trial.  (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  CCP section 437c, subdivision (c)
requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence
submitted, and all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence and
uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)
 
As to each claim as framed by the complaint, the
defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial burden of proof
by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to establish a defense.  (CCP § 437c, subd. (p)(2); Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.)  Courts
liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that
party.  (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
 
Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.  To establish a triable issue of material
fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive
evidence.  (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)  
 
Undisputed
Material Facts
In support of the Motion, Moving Defendant provides
evidence that it implemented a mask requirement as a preventative measure to
limit the spread of the COVID-19 virus in its community.  (See Separate Statement of Undisputed
Material Facts (“UMF”) 3-10.)  On
multiple occasions in July and August of 2021, Plaintiff was seen maskless in
common areas.  (UMF 12.)  Moving Defendant’s board of directors subsequently
voted to deny Plaintiff’s request for an exemption from the mask mandate.  (See UMF 19.)  Moving Defendant notified Plaintiff of this
decision on August 17, 2021.  (UMF
20.)  Plaintiff was thereafter observed
not wearing a mask in common areas.  (See
UMF 21.)  Moving Defendant held a
disciplinary hearing on October 19, 2021 to consider Plaintiff’s ongoing
violations of the mask mandate, and decided to fine Plaintiff for violating the
rule.  (UMF 25, 27-28.)  On November 15, 2021, Moving Defendant held
another disciplinary hearing to address Plaintiff’s continued violations of the
mask mandate and implemented an escalated fine due to the ongoing nature of
Plaintiff’s violations.  (See UMF
29-32.)  On January 12, 2022, after
conducting another disciplinary hearing to address Plaintiff’s mask mandate
violations, Moving Defendant imposed an additional fine and suspended
Plaintiff’s common area privileges for 30 days. 
(UMF 33-34.)  The common area
privileges that were suspended as a result of the vote at the January 12, 2022
hearing were: switchboard calls, door attendants, valet parking, non-emergency
engineering, loading dock, Spectrum cable television, and gym, sauna, swimming
pool, and tennis courts.  (UMF 35.)  The temporary suspension of these common area
privileges was consistent with Moving Defendant’s policy and procedures, and
these privileges were reinstated on February 12, 2022.  (UMF 36-37.) 
After Plaintiff was again observed not wearing a mask in common areas,
another disciplinary hearing was held on February 16, 2022 that resulted in a
second temporary suspension of common area privileges.  (UMF 38-42.) 
Moving Defendant’s enforcement of the mask mandate was not unique to
Plaintiff.  (UMF 44.)  
 
Fourth
Cause of Action: Civil Code Section 789.3
Under Civil Code section 789.3, subd. (a), a
landlord shall not with intent to terminate the occupancy under any lease or
other tenancy or estate at will, however created, of property used by a tenant
as his residence willfully cause, directly or indirectly, the interruption or
termination of any utility service furnished the tenant, including, but not
limited to, water, heat, light, electricity, gas, telephone, elevator, or
refrigeration, whether or not the utility service is under the control of the landlord.  (Civ. Code § 789.3, subd. (a).)
 
            The Court finds that Moving Defendant has met its burden
to show that there are no triable issues of material fact regarding the fourth
cause of action.  Moving Defendant’s
evidence establishes that its suspensions of Plaintiff’s common area privileges
were not intended to terminate Plaintiff’s tenancy; rather, the suspensions were
disciplinary responses to Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the mask
mandate.  Furthermore, Moving Defendant’s
evidence indicates that the privileges that were suspended do not constitute
utility services within the meaning of Civil Code section 789.3, subdivision
(a).  For this reason and because
Plaintiff has not introduced evidence to raise a triable issue of material
fact, the Court GRANTS the Motion with respect to the fourth cause of action.  (Sexton
v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
Sixth Cause of Action: Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress
The
elements of a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress are: (1)
the defendant’s extreme and outrageous behavior with the intention of causing,
or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2)
the plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress; and (3) the defendant’s
extreme and outrageous conduct was the actual and proximate cause of the severe
emotional distress.  (Hughes v. Pair
(2009) 46 Cal.4th 1035, 1050.)  Conduct
is considered extreme and outrageous when it is so extreme as to exceed all
bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.  (Id.) 
Behavior may be considered outrageous if a defendant: (1) abuses a
position that gives him power over a plaintiff’s interest; (2) knows the
plaintiff is susceptible to injuries through emotional distress; or (3) acts
intentionally or unreasonably when the conduct is likely to result in mental
distress and illness.  (Agarwal v.
Johnson (1979) 25 Cal.3d 932, 946.) 
Whether conduct is extreme or outrageous is generally a question of
fact.  (See Barker v. Fox &
Associates (2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 333, 356.)
 
            Moving Defendant’s evidence satisfies Moving Defendant’s
burden to demonstrate that its decisions to suspend Plaintiff’s common area
privileges were not extreme or outrageous behavior; rather, Moving Defendant’s
evidence demonstrates that its conduct was within its discretion to enforce
rules imposed on the community it governs. 
For this reason and because Plaintiff has not introduced evidence that
raises a triable issue of material fact, the Court GRANTS the Motion with
respect to the sixth cause of action.  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
