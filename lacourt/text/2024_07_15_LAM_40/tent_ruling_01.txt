Background
Plaintiff 5007 Holdings, LLC sues Defendants Jun I. Yoon, an individual,
and as Trustee of the Jun I. Yoon Trust UDT August 15, 1994 (“Yoon”) and Does 1
to 10 pursuant to an August 7, 2023 Second Amended Complaint (SAC) alleging
claims of (1) Breach of Contract and (2) Misrepresentation.
The claims arise from allegations that Plaintiff 5007 Holdings—a
successor-in-interest borrower on a loan made pursuant to a promissory note (as
amended) and deed of trust secured by real property owned by Plaintiff in
Marina Del Rey, California—was overcharged interest and late fee payments, as
well as attorney fees charged in relation to loan renegotiations with
Defendants Yoon, the lender, and that Yoon made misrepresentations in relation
to the principal and interest owned on the loan.
