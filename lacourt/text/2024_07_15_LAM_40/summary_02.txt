Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the State's demurrer to the First Amended Complaint filed by Apex Development, Inc. The complaint alleges two claims: quasi-contract—restitution and intentional interference with contractual relations. The Court finds that the complaint fails to cite a statute permitting Apex to sue a public entity for unjust enrichment or intentional interference with contractual relations, and that the claims are not sufficiently stated. The Court also notes that Apex failed to file an opposition to the demurrer and that the failure to oppose may be deemed an abandonment of the claims. As a result, the Court denies leave to amend and orders the State to file a proposed order of dismissal within 20 days.
