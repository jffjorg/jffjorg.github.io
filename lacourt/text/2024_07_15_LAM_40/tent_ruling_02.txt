Background
Pleadings
Plaintiff Apex Development, Inc. (Apex) sues Defendant The People of the
State of California (the State), acting by and through the Department of
Transportation (erroneously sued as “California Department of Transportation, a
department of the State of California”)
and Does 1 through 20 pursuant to a February 9, 2024 First Amended Complaint
alleging claims of (1) quasi-contract—restitution and (2) Intentional
Interference with Contractual Relations.
The claims arise from the following allegations. Apex rents multiple
airspace leases from the California Department of Transportation (CalTrans),
which are typically adjacent to freeway onramps and exists or under elevated
portions of freeways, including a CalTrans lot located under the Interstate 10
freeway in Los Angeles, California at the intersection of 14th Street and
Lawrence, Los Angeles 90021, subject an airspace lease [No. 07-LAX010-0012]
(the Property). In relation to the Property, Apex has invested $139,899 to
improve the lot, including by cleaning debris and other refuse from the
Property, making repairs to the Property due to CalTrans freeway retrofitting,
making safety repairs to paving and crack filler on the Property, and making
repairs to the fence on the Property. Apex had reported these issues to
CalTrans prior to making repairs, but CalTrans failed to act and offered no
contribution toward possible expenses, forcing Apex to incur the above costs.
Apex later requested restitution for its expenses maintaining the Property,
which CalTrans rejected. As a result, in May 2023, Apex filed a government
claim. Shortly prior to this, in April 2023, a CalTrans employee named “Daryll”
entered the Property without Apex’s permission and directed Apex’s tenants not
to pay rent to Apex. Apex complained of Darryll’s actions with CalTrans, which
dismissed Apex’s claims and continued to send Darryll and other employees to
enter the Property without notifying Apex and instructing Apex’s tenants to not
pay rent to Apex.
Motion Before the Court
On March 26, 2024, the State filed
a demurrer to the first and second causes of action of the FAC based on
sufficiency of pleading.
As of July 12, 2024, no opposition
has been filed.
The State’s demurrer is now before
the Court.
 
Demurrer
Legal
Standard
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (e).) This device can be used only to challenge defects that
appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the
pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.) To sufficiently allege a cause of action,
a complaint must allege all the ultimate
facts—that is, the facts needed to establish each element of the cause of
action pleaded. (Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods
Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 212, superseded by statute as stated in Branick
v. Downey Savings & Loan Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.)
Thus, “[t]o survive a [general] demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts
sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might
eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v.
William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) In
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth
of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) A demurrer, however, “does not admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab
Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept.
of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other
grounds, Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th
1158, 1162.) The face of the complaint includes exhibits attached to the
complaint. (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.) If facts
appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits
take precedence. (Holland v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86
Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in White
v. Cridlebaugh (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 506, 521.)
Demurrer,
Complaint, First and Second Causes of Action, Quasi-Contract—Restitution and Intentional
Interference with Contractual Relations: SUSTAINED, without leave to
amend.
After
review, the Court SUSTAINS the State’s demurrer.
The
Court initially notes that the demurrer was served on Plaintiff Apex’s counsel
via email to the same email address appearing in the Complaint. (Demurrer,
Proof of Service [service by email to mdattaray@dattaraylaw.com]; cf. FAC, p. 1
[caption page containing same email address for Plaintiff’s counsel].)
Despite
service, no opposition has been filed.
Moving
to the merits, as with the prior demurrer to the original complaint, the Court
finds that one argument is availing as to both causes of action: the Complaint
fails to cite a statute permitting Apex to sue a public entity for unjust
enrichment or intentional interference with contractual relations. (See Demurrer,
pp. 4-5, 7-8.) “Except as otherwise provided by statute,” “(a) [a] public
entity is not liable for an injury, whether such injury arises out of an act or
omission of the public entity or a public employee or any other person.” (Gov.
Code, § 815, subd. (a).) A review of the Complaint shows that no statute is
referenced. Rather, the two counts stated in the Complaint are tort claims—and
unjust enrichment is not a claim at all, as discussed below. It therefore
follows that the Complaint’s claims are not sufficiently stated. This is
particularly the case where “to state a cause of action against a public
entity, every fact material to the existence of its statutory liability must be
pleaded with particularity” (Lopez v. Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist.
(1985) 40 Cal.3d 780, 795, citations omitted), including the existence of a
statutory duty, where “[d]uty cannot be alleged simply by stating ‘defendant
had a duty under the law’; that is a conclusion of law, not an allegation of
fact” (Searcey v. Hemet Unified School Dist. (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 792,
902, citations omitted).
In
addition, as to the quasi-contract cause of action, applicable law holds that
no such claim may be brought against a public entity.  “As a general rule, a public entity cannot be
sued on a implied in law or quasi-contract theory, because such a theory is
based on quantum meruit or restitution considerations which are outweighed by
the need to protect and limit a public entity’s contractual obligations.”  (Lundeen Coatings Corp. v. Department of
Water & Power (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 816, 831, fn 9.)  
The
State’s demurrer is thus SUSTAINED.
The
Court previously granted Plaintiff leave to amend despite its failure to file
an opposition.  Plaintiff has again
failed to file an opposition to Defendant’s demurrer to the FAC.  Plaintiff’s FAC failed to cure the defects
raised by the prior demurrer, i.e. the failure to cite any statutory basis for
liability.  As such, Plaintiff fails to
establish that the defects can be cured with leave to amend.  (Hendy v. Losse (1991) 54 Cal.3d 723,
742.)  In addition, Plaintiff’s failure
to oppose may be deemed an abandonment of the claims alleged in the FAC.  (Herzberg v. County of Plumas (2005)
133 Cal.App.4th 1, 20.)  For these
reasons, leave to amend is denied. 

Conclusion
Defendant The People of the State
of California, acting by and through the Department of Transportation’s
Demurrer to Complaint is SUSTAINED, without leave to amend.  Defendant The People of the State of
California, acting by and through the Department of Transportation, to file a
proposed order of dismissal within 20 days.
