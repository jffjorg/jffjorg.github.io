This tentative ruling is in response to a motion filed by Plaintiff Kimberly Harwood's counsel, Neil Steiner, seeking to be relieved from representation due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The Court has reviewed the motion and finds that the counsel has not provided sufficient information to justify the request, particularly given the proximity of the trial date and the age of the case. As a result, the Court denies the motion to relieve counsel.
