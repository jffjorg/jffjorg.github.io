The motion is related to a deposition held on October 24, 2023, where the Plaintiff, Alejandro Choy, failed to produce any documents requested in the deposition notice. The Defendant made a good faith effort to meet and confer with the Plaintiff, but since no response was received, the Defendant filed the motion to compel production of the documents. The Court finds that the motion is timely and that the Plaintiff failed to object to the deposition notice, so the motion is granted. The Court also awards monetary sanctions in the amount of $400 against the Plaintiff and his counsel of record, jointly and severally, to be paid within 30 days. The Defendant shall provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service of such.
