MOTION
 
On
January 20, 2022, Plaintiffs TC Nevada, LLC and TLC Luxury, LLC (“Plaintiffs”)
filed a complaint against Defendants Ramon Valdez, Ramon Valdez dba Matrix
Mattresses, Elias Hernandez, Elias Hernandez dba H&H Pallet Company,
Luzelena Hernandez, Luzelena Hernandez dba H&H Pallet Company, and Does 1
to 50 for negligence and negligence per se.  
 
On August 2, 2023, Plaintiffs filed an amendment to the complaint,
substituting Defendant Tere Pallets Corporation (“Defendant”), as Doe 26. 
 
Defendant now demurs to the entire complaint on the basis that it
fails to state facts to constitute a cause of action. Plaintiffs oppose and
Defendant replies. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
The primary function of a pleading is to give the other party notice
so that it may prepare its case [citation], and a defect in a pleading that
otherwise properly notifies a party cannot be said to affect substantial
rights.” (Harris v. City of Santa Monica (2013) 56 Cal.4th 203, 240.) “A demurrer tests the
legal sufficiency of the factual allegations in a complaint.” (Ivanoff v.
Bank of America, N.A. (2017)
9 Cal.App.5th 719, 725.) It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form
or content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or
cross-complaint).  (Code Civ. Proc. §§
422.10, 589; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th
968, 994.)  It is not the function of the
demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of
the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to
be true.  (Donabedian, 116
Cal.App.4th at 994.)
 
A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the
face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that
are judicially noticeable.  (Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th
at 994.)  No other extrinsic evidence can
be considered.  (Ion Equip. Corp. v.
Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court to consider facts
asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States
Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other
grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d
287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court record].)
 
A demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is
incomplete or discloses some defense that would bar recovery.  (Guardian North Bay, Inc. v. Superior
Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-72.) 

 
Where a demurrer is sustained,
leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of
successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court
that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.; Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.)
However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state
a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to
amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation
Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).  
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this
chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.
(a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the
responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).)
Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a declaration detailing
their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(3).)
 
According to the Declaration of Rebecca D. Webster, it does not appear a
meet and confer took place by telephone or in-person. Nevertheless, “[a]
determination by the court that the meet and confer process was insufficient
shall not be grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
430.41 (a)(4).)
 
JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
The Court takes judicial
notice of the existence of the Declarations of Nina Scotti and Stephen Bucklin
as part of the Court’s record but does not take notice of the truth of the
matters asserted within. (Evid. Code § 452(d).)
 
ANALYSIS
 
The elements of a cause of action for negligence are: (1) a
duty on the part of defendant toward plaintiff; (2) defendant’s breach of that
duty; and (3) harm to the plaintiff caused by that breach. (Kesner v.
Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1142.) 
 
“The negligence per se doctrine, as codified in Evidence
Code section 669, creates a presumption of negligence if four elements are
established: (1) the defendant violated a statute, ordinance, or regulation of
a public entity; (2) the violation proximately caused death or injury to person
or property; (3) the death or injury resulted from an occurrence of the nature
of which the statute, ordinance, or regulation was designed to prevent; and (4)
the person suffering the death or the injury to his person or property was one
of the class of persons for whose protection the statute, ordinance, or
regulation was adopted.” (Spates v. Dameron Hospital Association (2003)
114 Cal.App.4th 208, 218, quotation marks omitted.) “The doctrine of negligence
per se is not a separate cause of action, but creates an evidentiary
presumption that affects the standard of care in a cause of action for
negligence.” (Johnson v. Honeywell International Inc. (2009) 179
Cal.App.4th 549, 555, quotation marks and brackets omitted.)   
 
Here, the complaint contains the following
allegations:
 
“The
true names and capacities of Defendants DOES 26 through 50, inclusive, and the full
extent of the facts linking those fictitiously designed Defendants with the
causes of action alleged herein, are unknown to Plaintiff, who therefore sues
said Defendants by such fictitious names. Plaintiff is informed, believes, and
alleges that at all times alleged herein, each Defendant designated as a DOE
was acting as an agent, servant, employee, and/or alter ego of its Co-Defendants,
and was acting in the course and scope of its authority as such agent, servant,
employee, and/or alter ego of its Co-Defendants. Each Defendant designated
herein as DOE. is in some manner legally responsible to Plaintiff for damages
or other relief as prayed for herein.”
(Complaint, 3:21–4:1.)
 
The complaint alleges that the
defendants also knew or should have known of a dangerous condition on their property,
namely negligently stacked pallets and negligently stored propane. (Complaint,
4:3–8.) It also alleges they owed a duty not to stack the pallets beyond the
height allowed by law, and that this caused Plaintiff’s damages. (Complaint, 4:9–15.)
Although Defendant argues that certain evidence contradicts Plaintiff’s claims (see
Reply at pp. 4-5), the truth of such evidence is not judicially noticeable and
therefore cannot be considered for purposes of this demurrer.
 
However, the Court agrees that
the complaint does not identify which statutes, ordinances, regulations, or
codes form the basis of the negligence per se claim. Without naming which
requirement Defendant has failed to satisfy, the pleading is subject to
demurrer. (See Evraets v. Intermedics Intraocular, Inc. (1994) 29
Cal.App.4th 779, 794 [“Evraets’s complaint fails to illuminate which of the
innumerable regulatory requirements respondents failed to satisfy. In this
regard, his pleading is inadequate. Evraets must specify which of the protocols
respondents violated. He cannot make respondents and the court guess at which
law was violated.”] [abrogated on other grounds by Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr
(1996) 518 U.S. 470, 497-502].) To the extent that Plaintiffs are able to
specify at the hearing which regulation will be asserted, they will be granted
leave to amend.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiffs’ complaint is overruled
in part and sustained in part.
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
