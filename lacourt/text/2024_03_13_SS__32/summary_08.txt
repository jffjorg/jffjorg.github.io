And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively denied the petition for minors' compromise filed by Petitioner Armando Castillo on behalf of Claimant Angela Castillo, age 17, without prejudice. The reason for this denial is that the most recent medical report from July 2022 indicates that Claimant was still experiencing symptoms from the injury, and the Court requires a more recent report or medical record to confirm that Claimant is fully recovered. The Court has also approved Petitioner's request for $1,000 in attorney fees, which represents 22.5% of the gross settlement. Finally, the Court has instructed Petitioner to correct the proposed order (MC-351) by including the gross settlement amount and to provide notice and file proof of service.
