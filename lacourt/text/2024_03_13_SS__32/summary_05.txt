And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Tere Pallets Corporation to the complaint filed by Plaintiffs TC Nevada and TLC Luxury, LLC. The court has overruled the demurrer in part and sustained it in part. Specifically, the court has found that the complaint does not identify which statutes, ordinances, regulations, or codes form the basis of the negligence per se claim, and therefore, the demurrer is sustained in part. However, the court has also found that the complaint alleges a cause of action for negligence and that the parties are encouraged to meet and confer concerning the tentative ruling. The court will grant leave to amend if the parties can specify at the hearing which regulation will be asserted. The court's final ruling will be issued after considering the parties' responses to this tentative ruling.
