And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has sustained the demurrer filed by the defendants without leave to amend. The plaintiff, Consuela Hubbard, has failed to adequately plead the necessary elements of a breach of contract claim. The complaint is uncertain and lacks specificity, making it difficult for the defendants to respond. The court has also noted that the plaintiff has failed to attach a copy of the alleged written agreement to the complaint, and that the terms of the agreement are not clear. The court has concluded that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient information to state a cause of action, and therefore the demurrer is sustained. The plaintiff has not responded to the demurrer and has not indicated that she can cure the defects in her pleading, so the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.
