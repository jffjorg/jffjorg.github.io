RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Robert Moynihan
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order
compelling
Defendant Robert Moynihan to serve responses to Plaintiff Siegfred Conson’s
Form Interrogatories, Set 2, served on 8/15/24.

in the amount of $1,568.91.  

 
RULING: The motion is denied, in part, and
granted, in part, as set forth below.    
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a motor vehicle v. bicycle
collision that occurred on 10/22/21 in Santa Clarita.  Plaintiff Siegfred Conson (Plaintiff) alleges
that while making a right turn, Defendant Robert Moynihan (Defendant) struck
Plaintiff while Plaintiff was riding his bicycle within the cross-walk on a
green light.
 
On 3/8/23, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendant
and Patricia Moynihan for negligence.  On
4/14/23, Defendant and Patricia Moynihan answered the complaint.
 
On 8/15/24, Plaintiff electronically served his Form
Interrogatories, Set 2, on Defendant making responses due on or before 9/16/24.  (Herron Decl., Ex.1).  No responses were received; therefore, on
9/19/24, Plaintiff’s counsel’s office sent a meet and confer email to
Defendant’s counsel requesting complete, verified responses, without objection,
within 7 days.  (Gordon Decl.,
Ex.1).  No response to the meet and
confer letter was received and Defendant failed to serve responses to the Form
Interrogatories.  (Gordon Decl.; Herron
Decl.).  
 
On 10/2/24, Plaintiff filed and electronically served the
instant motion seeking an order compelling Defendant Robert Moynihan to serve
responses to Plaintiff Siegfred Conson’s Form Interrogatories, Set 2, served on
8/15/24.  Additionally, Plaintiff
requests sanctions against Defendant and/or his counsel, Collison, Daehnke,
Inlow & Greco, in the amount of $1,568.91. 
The motion was originally scheduled for hearing on 3/24/25 but was then
rescheduled to be heard on 12/16/24. 
Notice of the change of hearing date was served on 10/15/24.  Defendant has not opposed or otherwise
responded to the motion.  On 12/5/24,
Plaintiff filed and served a Notice of Non-Opposition to the motion along with additional
declarations in support of the motion.  
ANALYSIS
 
The additional declarations filed with the Notice of
Non-Opposition indicate that since the filing of the motion, Defendant has
served responses, first amended responses and second amended responses to the
subject Form Interrogatories.  (See
Additional Herron and Gordon Decls.).  
 
The  Court finds
that the service of responses to the subject Form Interrogatories renders the
request to compel responses moot.  If
Plaintiff is not satisfied with the various responses served by Plaintiff, he
must file and serve a timely motion to compel further responses based on the
12/2/24 service of the second amended responses.  See CCP 2030.300(c).  
 
The Court finds that sanctions against Defendant and his
counsel are warranted because the second amended responses without objections
were not served until 12/2/24, after the filing of the motion and Plaintiff’s
counsel’s multiple meet and confer efforts. 
See CCP 2030.290(c); CCP 2023.010(d), (i); CCP 2023.020; CCP
2023.030(a); CRC 3.1348(a).  The Court
finds that the $1,568.91 requested by Plaintiff to be reasonable based on 2
hours to prepare the motion + 1 hour to prepare the notice of non-opposition
and additional declarations at $500/hour + a filing fee of $68.91.  (See Herron Decls. submitted in
support of the motion and reply).      
 
CONCLUSION
 
The request to compel responses is denied as moot.  Plaintiff’s request for sanctions against
Defendant Robert Moynihan and his counsel, Collison, Daehnke, Inlow & Greco,
in the amount of $1,568.91 is granted. 
Sanctions are payable within 30 days. 

 
The Court notes that in violation of CRC 3.1110(f)(4)
Plaintiff has failed to electronically bookmark the exhibits submitted in
support of the moving papers (the exhibits submitted with additional
declarations are electronically bookmarked). 
Counsel for the parties are warned that failure to comply with this rule
in the future may result in matters being continued so that papers can be
resubmitted in compliance, papers not being considered and/or the imposition of
sanctions.
