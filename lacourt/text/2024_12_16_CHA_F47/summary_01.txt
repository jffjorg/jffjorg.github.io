```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request to compel the defendant to serve responses to the Form Interrogatories, Set 2, as moot. The defendant has since served responses to the interrogatories, making the request unnecessary. However, the judge has granted the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant and his counsel, Collison, Daehnke, Inlow & Greco, in the amount of $1,568.91. The sanctions are payable within 30 days. The judge notes that the plaintiff failed to electronically bookmark the exhibits submitted in support of the motion, in violation of CRC 3.1110(f)(4), and warns the parties that failure to comply with this rule in the future may result in sanctions.
