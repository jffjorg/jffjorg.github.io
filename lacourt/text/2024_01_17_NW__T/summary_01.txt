And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing to a future date and has requested that the petitioner, Julia Gandelsman, file a copy of the respondent, Vladislov Shuliko's, Claim of Exemption within five court days. The judge has made this decision because the Claim of Exemption was not filed with the court despite being served with the notice of opposition, and the briefing on the matter is incomplete without a copy of the Claim of Exemption. The judge is continuing the hearing to allow for further proceedings and to ensure that the matter is fully briefed before making a final decision.
