Petitioner Julia Gandelsman’s Notice of Opposition on Claim of Exemption
and Respondent Vladislov Shuliko’s Claim of Exemption is CONTINUED to
__________________, 2024.  The Court
requests Petitioner Julia Gandelsman to file a copy of Respondent Vladislov
Shuliko’s Claim of Exemption within five court days.  
Introduction 
Petitioner/Judgment Creditor Julia Gandelsman (Gandelsman)
noticed the hearing for and filed an opposition to Respondent/Judgment Debtor
Vladislov Shuliko (Shuliko) Claim of Exemption (COE).  
Procedure
Upon filing and service of the notice of opposition and
notice of motion with the levying officer and the court, the levying officer is
mandated to “promptly file the claim of exemption with the court.”  (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 703.550.)  The notice of opposition filed by Gandelsman
attached a proof of service showing service of the notice of opposition to the
levying officer, Los Angeles County Sheriff (Sheriff).  Despite service of the notice of opposition
upon the Sheriff, the Court record does not reflect the filing of Shuliko’s COE
by the Sheriff.  Without a copy of the
COE from the Sheriff, the briefing on this matter is incomplete.  
In the interest of judicial economy, the Court requests
Gandelsman to file a courtesy copy of the Shuliko’s COE within five court
days.  
The Court CONTINUES the instant hearing.  
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
