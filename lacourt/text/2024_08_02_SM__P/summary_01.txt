The court has reviewed the unopposed motion by Stiffelman to compel Rubin to produce his expert witnesses and documents for depositions, as well as his request for sanctions. Stiffelman served Rubin with deposition notices on April 12, 2024, but Rubin failed to produce the expert witnesses and documents on the scheduled deposition dates. The court finds that Stiffelman has demonstrated good cause for the requested documents, which are relevant to the deposition of Rubin's expert witnesses. The court grants sanctions of $7,500, plus costs, payable within 30 days, due to Rubin's failure to comply with discovery requests.
