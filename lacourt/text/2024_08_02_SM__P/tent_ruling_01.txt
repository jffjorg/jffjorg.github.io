Ruling 
Stiffelman v.
Rubin et al., Case No. 19SMCV01908 
Hearing Date:
August 02, 2024 
Plaintiff
Stiffelman’s Motion to Compel Defendant Rubin to Produce his Experts for
Depositions and Request for Sanctions - UNOPPOSED
 
Stiffelman served
Stewart Rubin with deposition notices of Rubin’s three expert witnesses and a
request to produce documents on April 12, 2024. The depositions were scheduled
for May 23, 28 and 30, 2024. Rubin failed to produce both expert witness and
the requested documents on the scheduled deposition dates. Stiffelman moves to
produce David E. Abshier, Dara L. Hendrix, and Heather H. Xitco for depositions,
to produce the documents requested in the notices of each expert and for
sanctions. 
 
In California, discovery
statutes “must be construed liberally in favor of disclosure unless the request
is clearly improper.” Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531,
541. “Under the discovery statutes, information is discoverable if it is
unprivileged and is either relevant to the subject matter of the action or
reasonably calculated to reveal admissible evidence.” John B. v. Superior
Court (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1177, 1186. “Discovery may relate to the claim or
defense of the party seeking discovery or of any other party to the action.” Id.

 
“The service of a deposition
notice under Section 2025.240 is effective to require any deponent who is a
party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party to attend and to testify, as well as produce any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and copying.” Code Civ.
Proc. §2025.280(a).¿¿“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the
action . . . without having served a valid objection . . . fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.” Code Civ. Proc. §2025.450(a).  
 
A motion made pursuant to
Code Civ. Proc. §2025.450 must “set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.” Code Civ.
Proc. §2025.450(b)(1). If a motion under Code Civ. Proc. §2025.450(a) is
granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . in favor of the
party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or party with whom
the deponent is affiliated unless the court finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.” Code Civ. Proc.
§2025.450(g)(1).¿   
 
Stiffelman
provides a declaration from counsel stating Rubin failed to provide his expert
witnesses on the date they were scheduled and produced none of the requested
documents. Laquer Decl. ¶ 4-5; Exh. E, F, & G. Counsel states he sent
several letters inquiring about the expert witnesses' non-appearance but
received no responses. Id. ¶¶ 6-7; Exh. H & I. Stiffelman
demonstrates good cause for the requested documents in his separate statement
as they are relevant to the deposition of Rubin’s expert witnesses. There is no
opposition.
 
Stiffelman requests
$10,245.90 in attorney’s fees as sanctions. This figure includes 9 hours from
Laquer billed at $225 an hour, 12.7 hours billed by Capozzola at $290 an hour,
2.9 hours billed by Wilkowski at $200 an hour in relation to the depositions
and $200 in costs. Id. ¶¶ 15-20. It additionally includes 4 hours from
Laquer and 2.5 hours billed by Capozzola to prepare a reply. Id. Since
there was no opposition, there is no need for a reply, which is not necessary,
as no opposition was filed. 
 
The court notes
sanctions were previously ordered (3/24/23, 12/20/23 and 4/24/24) due to prior
discovery abuses.
 
The number of
hours and total amounts requested seem excessive, given that this was a pro
forma discovery motion that was unopposed. The court will grant sanctions of
$7,500, plus costs, payable within 30 days. GRANTED.
