And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Elysienne, LLC and Courtney Cohen (cross-defendants) against Vincent Zadeh and Pineapple Ventures, Inc. (cross-complainants). The cross-defendants argue that the cross-complainants are unable to state causes of action due to the court's issue and evidentiary sanctions imposed on May 17, 2024. The court has granted the motion, finding that the cross-complainants are precluded from asserting or offering any evidence to establish their causes of action, and as no opposition was filed, the cross-defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
