12518 Sunset
Group, LLC, et al. v. Lionscove Fund 1, LLC, Case No. 24SMCV00772
Hearing Date:
August 02, 2024
Defendant Lionscove
Fund 1 LLC’s Demurer to First Amended Complaint 

 
Plaintiffs 12518
Sunset Group and Campbell brought this foreclosure action, alleging Lionscove
Fund 1 LLC failed to provide funds under the parties’ loan agreement. Lionscove
demurrers to the first, second and third causes of action, arguing they fail to
state a cause of action and are uncertain. Lionscove also argues Campbell lacks
standing, as he is not a real party in interest.
 
Plaintiffs'
request for judicial notice of a copy of the mortgage modification recorded as
Document No. 20230284765 on May 2, 2023 (Exhibit A), is granted under Evid.
Code §452(c), as an official document of the Los Angeles County recorder’s
office. 
 
Lionscove’s
request for judicial notice of 1) the Assignment of Deed Trust recorded on
October 17, 2022, as Document No. 202200993294; 2) Notice of Default and
Election to Settle Under the Deed of Trust recorded on September 27, 2023, as
Document No. 20230650599; 3) Notice of Trustee’s Sale recorded on January 3,
2024, as Document No. 20240003475 are also granted under Evid. Code §452(c), as
documents of the Los Angeles County recorder’s office. 
 
“[D]emurrers for
uncertainty are disfavored, and are granted only if the pleading is so
incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably respond.” Lickiss v. Fin. Industry Regulatory
Authority (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135. A demurrer for uncertainty
does not address whether the pleading fails to “incorporate sufficient facts in
the pleading but is directed at the uncertainty existing in the allegations
actually made.” Butler v. Sequeira (1950)
100 Cal.App.2d 143, 145-146. Rather, a demurrer is intended to address whether
a pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot understand the
allegations actually made. Id. at p.
146.
 
The FAC is not
incomprehensible because it alleges Lionscove's actions interfered with plaintiffs'
contract performance and it acted in bad faith by stalling reimbursements,
delaying inspections, and disbursing smaller payments than warranted. Lionscove’s
arguments are largely brought on the grounds that the three causes of action
fail to state sufficient facts.
 
Lionscove argues Campbell lacks standing to sue under CCP §367 because
the complaint does not provide facts to describe his role in underlying
allegations or to allege wrongdoing against him. CCP section 367 provides
“[e]very action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest,
except as otherwise provided by statute.” Code Civ. Proc. §367. “Only the real
party in interest has ‘an actual and substantial interest in the subject matter
of the action,’ and stands to be ‘benefited or injured’ by a judgment in the
action.” City of Santa Monica v. Stewart (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 43, 60.
The FAC alleges
Campbell is owner of the property located at 12518 West Sunset. Sunset Group executed
a deed transferring title to Campbell in January 2024. FAC ¶ 2. Campbell is a
necessary party, as the action deals with the dispute over the foreclosure of
the property. Campbell stands to be benefited or injured by a judgment because the
outcome would affect his interest in the property. The court cannot say, on the
face of the pleadings, that Cambell lacks standing. 
 
Breach of Covenant
of Good Faith and Fair Dealing 
Lionscove argues the cause of action fails because the
FAC does not allege: 1) plaintiffs performed, 2) all conditions for defendant
to perform were met, 3) defendant unfairly interfered with plaintiff's right to
receive the benefit of the contract, and 4) damages. Defendant argues the allegations
are inapplicable because, as a private money lender, Lionscove did not exceed
its conventional role and acted merely as a lender without ownership or control
over the Loan, having fully assigned its beneficial interest in the Note and
Deed of Trust to EF Mortgage. Lionscove additionally argues the claim is
duplicative of the second cause of action.  

“A breach of the implied covenant of good faith and
fair dealing involves something beyond breach of the contractual duty itself
and it has been held that bad faith implies unfair dealing rather than mistaken
judgment.” Careau & Co. v. Security
Pacific Business Credit, Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1371, 1394. “If the
allegations do not go beyond the statement of a mere contract breach and,
relying on the same alleged acts, simply seek the same damages or other relief
already claimed in a companion contract cause of action, they may be
disregarded as superfluous as no additional claim is actually stated … [T]he
only justification for asserting a separate cause of action for breach of the
implied covenant is to obtain a tort recovery.” Id. at pp. 1394-1395. To recover in tort for breach of the implied
covenant, the defendant must “have acted unreasonably or without proper cause.”
Id. at p. 1395, citations and italics
omitted. 
The FAC alleges Sunset Group refinanced its mortgage
with a loan from Lionscove in August 2022. FAC ¶13. On October 17, 2022 the
beneficial interest in the mortgage loan was transferred to EF Mortgage, LLC,
unbeknownst to plaintiffs. Id. ¶21. Plaintiffs allege performance under
the contract because Sunset Group continued to deal with Lionscove regarding
loan disbursements. Id. Under the agreement for Sunset Group to obtain
construction withdrawals, Sunset Group had to request them, prompting Lionscove
or EF Mortgage, LLC to send an inspector to assess construction progress and
determine the disbursement amount. Id. ¶15. Although Sunset Group could
request draws at any time, Lionscove had control over the disbursement amounts.
Id. ¶22. 
Plaintiffs allege Lionscove unfairly interfered with its
right to receive the benefit of the contract because Lionscove stalled
payments, underestimated completion percentages and delayed inspections,
causing additional fees and delays. Id. ¶¶20-39. The resulting damage
was that Sunset Group had to extend the loan to avoid foreclosure, despite Lionscove
retaining substantial construction funds. Id. ¶¶40-41. This cause of
action differs from the breach of contract claim because it requires a showing
that defendant's conduct was unreasonable. OVERRULED. 
Breach of Contract 
Lionscove argues the cause of action for breach of
contract fails because it fails to identify relevant provisions of the contract
or attach the written agreement to the FAC. Lionscove further argues the claim
does not adequately lay out its breach of the loan modification and is
duplicative of the second cause of action. To state a cause of action for
breach of contract, plaintiff must establish “(1) the existence of the contract,
(2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s
breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821. If a
breach of contract claim “is based on alleged breach of a written contract, the
terms must be set out verbatim in the body of the complaint or a copy of the
written agreement must be attached and incorporated by reference.” Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999)
74 Cal.App.4th 299, 307. In some circumstances, plaintiff may “plead the legal
effect of the contract rather than its precise language.” Construction Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co.
(2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198-199. 
The FAC sufficiently identifies the relevant portions
of the contract, citing Sections 2.85 and 2.86 of the Loan and Security
Agreement, which set forth the condition’s precedent to reimbursement and final
disbursement of the construction funds. FAC ¶15. Plaintiffs allege Lionscove
breached the agreement by declining Sunset Group’s November 16, 2022 request
and refusing to provide a disbursement on December 15, 2022. Id. ¶26,
29. The FAC also pleads other instances in which defendants delayed or failed
to distribute construction proceeds as required under the agreement Id.
¶43-44, 47. This is enough to put Lionscove on notice both as to the relevant portions
of the parties' agreement and alleged breach. Therefore, at the pleadings stage,
this is enough to state a cause of action. OVERRULED.
Violation of Business and Professions Code
sec. 17200 
Finally, Lionscove
asserts the third cause of action for unfair business practices fails to
identify which section of the statutory scheme under the UCL was violated and
states no specific facts to support any such allegation. To set forth a claim
for a violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200, plaintiff must
establish defendant was engaged in an “unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business
act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising” and
certain specific acts. Bus. & Prof. Code §17200. A cause of action for
unfair competition “is not an all-purpose substitute for a tort or contract
action.” Cortez v. Purolator Air
Filtration Products Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 163, 173.
The FAC alleges defendant's conduct constituted unfair
business practices in violation of §17200. FAC ¶74. The FAC details specific
acts by Lionscove, allegin its refusal to disburse the requested funds harmed plaintiff,
causing it to incur loan extension fees, additional interest expenses exceeding
$350,000, a decreased projected property valuation due to market changes,
default interest charges and risk of foreclosure. Id. ¶¶ 47, 75-76. At
the pleadings stage, this is enough to state a cause of action. OVERRULED. 
Lionscove is to answer within 15 days.
