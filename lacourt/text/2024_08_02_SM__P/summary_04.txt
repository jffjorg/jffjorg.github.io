**Significant Statements**
```
Significant Statements:
  - The FAC is not incomprehensible because it alleges Lionscove's actions interfered with plaintiffs' contract performance.
  - Campbell lacks standing to sue only if the complaint does not provide facts to describe his role in underlying allegations or to allege wrongdoing against him.
  - A demurrer for uncertainty does not address whether the pleading fails to "incorporate sufficient facts in the pleading but is directed at the uncertainty existing in the allegations actually made."
  - To state a cause of action for breach of contract, plaintiff must establish the existence of the contract, plaintiff's performance or excuse for nonperformance, defendant's breach, and the resulting damages to the plaintiff.
  - The FAC sufficiently identifies the relevant portions of the contract and alleges Lionscove breached the agreement by declining Sunset Group's November 16, 2022 request and refusing to provide a disbursement on December 15, 2022.
  - At the pleadings stage, this is enough to state a cause of action for unfair business practices.
