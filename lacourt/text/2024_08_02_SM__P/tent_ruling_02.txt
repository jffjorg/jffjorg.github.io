Elysienne, LLC v.
Mehdizadeh, et al Case No. 21SMCV01266
Hearing Date:  August 2, 2024
Cross-Defendants
Elysienne, LLC and Courtney Cohen’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings –
UNOPPOSED
 
Vincent Zadeh and
Pineapple Ventures, Inc. bring a cross-complaint for breach of an interior
design service agreement for the design of an office space and retail location.
Cross-Defendants Elysienne and Cohen move for judgment on the pleadings on the
grounds that the court’s May 17, 2024 order renders cross-complainants unable
to state a cause of action. Cross-complainants have not filed an opposition. 
 
Cross-defendants’
request for the Court to take judicial notice of the court’s minute order
entered on May 17, 2024 is GRANTED under Evid. Code §452(d) as a record of the
court. 
 
The
standard for ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially
the same as that applicable to a general demurrer, that is, under the state of
the pleadings, together with matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears
that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Bezirdjian
v. O'Reilly (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th
316, 321-322, citing Schabarum v. California Legislature (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216. 
Matters which are subject to mandatory judicial notice may be treated as part
of the complaint and may be considered without notice to the parties. Matters
which are subject to permissive judicial notice must be specified in the notice
of motion, the supporting points, and authorities, or as the court otherwise
permits. Id. The motion may not be supported by extrinsic evidence. Barker
v. Hull (1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 221, 236.
 
When the moving party is a defendant, they must demonstrate either
of the following conditions exist: (i) the court has no jurisdiction of the
subject of the cause of action alleged; or (ii) the complaint does not state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against defendant. Code Civ.
Proc. §438(c)(1)(B). A motion for judgment on the pleadings must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. Code Civ. Proc. §439. See Marrow Decl.
 
Cross-defendants argue
that based on the issue and evidentiary sanctions imposed, cross-complainants
are unable to state the causes of action alleged: (1) breach of contract, (2)
breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, (3) fraud, (4) professional
negligence, and (5) unfair business practices. See SACC.
The court issued issue
and evidentiary sanctions on May 17, 2024, prohibiting cross-complainants from
supporting their causes of action against cross-defendants under CCP
§2023.030(b) and from introducing evidence in support of their claims under CCP
2023.030(c). RJN, Exh. 1, p. 2. The motion is unopposed. Because
cross-complainants are precluded from asserting or offering any evidence to
establish their causes of action, and because no opposition was filed, cross-defendants
are entitled to judgment as a matter law. GRANTED.
