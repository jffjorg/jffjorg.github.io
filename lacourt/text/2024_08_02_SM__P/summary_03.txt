Here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants James River Insurance Co.'s (JRIC) motion to compel arbitration in a case against Alexis Alvelo. The case arises from an uninsured motorist claim by Alvelo against JRIC, which is based on a motor vehicle accident on February 24, 2017. JRIC argues that the matter should be submitted to binding arbitration pursuant to Insurance Code § 11580.2(f) and CCP §128, et seq. Since no opposition has been filed, JRIC satisfied its burden under CCP §1281.2 by showing the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate and the refusal of Alvelo to arbitrate. The agreement covers the action because a dispute exists between the parties regarding the uninsured motorist's claim. The judge orders the parties to arbitrate the controversy and stays the proceedings pending the resolution of plaintiff's claims through arbitration.
