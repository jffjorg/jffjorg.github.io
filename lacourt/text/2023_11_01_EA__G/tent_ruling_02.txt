Corporation’s Demurrer to Complaint
Respondent: Plaintiff Guadalupe
Triner
TENTATIVE RULING
Defendant Costco Wholesale
Corporation’s Demurrer to Complaint is OVERRULED.  Defendant to file
its Answer in ten (10) days.
BACKGROUND
This
is a premises liability action. Defendant Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco)
owns and operates a warehouse in Azusa on Foothill Boulevard. In March 2021,
Plaintiff Guadalupe Triner was in the deli section of Costco’s Azusa warehouse
when Triner slipped and fell.
On
March 14, 2023, Triner filed a complaint against Costco, Joel Doe, and Does
1-50, alleging (1) negligence and (2) premises liability.
On
August 31, 2023, Costco filed a notice of removal to federal court. On
September 6, the United States District Court for the Central District of
California issued an order remanding this action.
On September
28, 2023, Costco filed the present demurrer. Prior to filing on August 31, Costco’s
counsel met and conferred telephonically with Triner’s counsel and was unable
to reach a resolution. (Breuer Decl., ¶ 2.)
A hearing
on the demurrer is set for November 1, 2023, along with a status conference re:
removal to federal court on December 5.
ANALYSIS
Costco
demurs to Triner’s entire Complaint on the grounds that it is uncertain and
inadequately pled. For the following reasons, the court OVERRULES Costco’s demurrer.
Legal Standard
A
party may demur to a complaint on the grounds that it “does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.
(e).) A demurrer tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747 (Hahn).) When considering
demurrers, courts accept all well pleaded facts as true. (Fox v. JAMDAT
Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) In a demurrer proceeding,
the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face
of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court
(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, at p. 747.)
Discussion
In
this case, Costco argues Triner’s Complaint is uncertain and inadequately pled
because its two causes of action for negligence and premises liability are
duplicative of each other.
The
court acknowledges there is a split of authority on whether a demurrer can be
sustained on grounds that a cause of action is duplicitous. In Blickman
Turkus, LP v. MF Downtown Sunnyvale, LLC (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 858 (Blickman
Turkus), the Sixth District Court of Appeal held a demurrer could not be
sustained on grounds that it is duplicative pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.10. (Id., at p. 890.) In Palm Springs Villas Homeowners
Assn., Inc. v. Parth (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 268 (Palm Springs Villas),
the Fourth District Court of Appeal held the opposite, noting a duplicative
cause of action is grounds upon which a demurrer may be sustained according to Rodrigues
v. Campbell Industries (1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 494, 501 (Rodrigues). (Palm
Springs Villas, supra, 248 Cal.App.4th at p. 290.)
Code
of Civil Procedure section 430.10 authorizes a party to bring a demurrer on
eight different grounds, none of which explicitly include grounds that a cause
of action is duplicative or superfluous. In Rodrigues, the Fourth
District Court of Appeal noted the cause of action at issue merely combined all
the previous causes of action and did not add anything to the complaint by way
or fact or theory of recovery. (Rodrigues, supra, 87 Cal.App.3d
at p. 498, 501.) But the court finds the reasoning in Blickman Turkus more
persuasive. Noting the jurisprudential maxim that “superfluity does not
vitiate” (Civ. Code, § 3537), the court held “[t]his is the sort of defect
that, if it justifies any judicial intervention at all, is ordinarily dealt
with most economically at trial, or on a dispositive motion such as summary
judgment.” (Blickman Turkus, supra, 162 Cal.App.4th at p. 890.)
Accordingly,
because a duplicative cause of action is not grounds for demurrer, Costco’s
demurrer is OVERRULED.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Costco’s
demurrer to Triner’s Complaint is OVERRULED.  Defendant to file its Answer in ten (10) days.
