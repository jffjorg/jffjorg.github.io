And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant's demurrer to the complaint is overruled. The plaintiff, Guadalupe Triner, slipped and fell in the deli section of Costco's warehouse in Azusa in March 2021. Triner filed a complaint against Costco, Joel Doe, and Does 1-50 alleging negligence and premises liability. Costco filed a notice of removal to federal court, which was later remanded to the state court. Costco then filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that it is uncertain and inadequately pled. The Judge found that a duplicative cause of action is not grounds for demurrer, citing the case Blickman Turkus, LP v. MF Downtown Sunnyvale, LLC. Therefore, the Judge overruled the demurrer and ordered the defendant to file its answer within 10 days.
