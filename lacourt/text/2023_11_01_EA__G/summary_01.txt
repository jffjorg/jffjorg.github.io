And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiffs, Shirley White and Gerald White, have applied for default judgment against Home Matters USA (also known as South West Consulting Enterprises, Inc.) for breaching a contract and committing fraud. The plaintiffs paid Home Matters USA a total of $32,474.70, but Home Matters USA failed to forward most of the money to the loan servicer, leading to the plaintiffs' mortgage becoming delinquent and on the verge of foreclosure. The court finds that Home Matters USA failed to respond or appear in court and therefore grants the plaintiffs' application for default judgment in the reduced amount of $40,589.81, which includes $32,474.70 in damages and $7,865.11 in interest.
