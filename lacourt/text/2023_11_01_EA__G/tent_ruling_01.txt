  Case Number:  21PSCV01053    Hearing Date:   November 1, 2023    Dept:  G Plaintiffs Shirley White  and Gerald White’s Application for Default Judgment Respondent: NO OPPOSITION TENTATIVE RULING Plaintiffs Shirley White  and Gerald White’s Application for Default Judgment is GRANTED in the reduced  amount of $40,589.81. BACKGROUND This  is a breach of contract and fraud action. In March 2020, Plaintiffs Shirley  White and Gerald White retained the services of Defendant Home Matters USA to  modify the mortgage encumbering their property in Baldwin Park. The Whites paid  $2,314.58 at intake followed by monthly payments of approximately $2,000 for a  total amount of $32,474.70. While less than one-third of the Whites’ money was  forwarded to their loan servicer, Home Matters USA kept the rest of the money.  As a result, the Whites’ mortgage became several months delinquent and on the  verge of foreclosure. On  December 16, 2021, the Whites filed a verified complaint against Home Matters  USA and Does 1-50 alleging the following causes of action: (1) breach of  contract, (2) intentional misrepresentation, (3) negligent misrepresentation,  (4) fraudulent concealment, (5) violations of Civil Code section 2944.7, (6)  breach of fiduciary duty, and (7) conversion. On December 20, the Whites’  process server served Home Matters USA with substitute service in Los Angeles. On  March 18, 2022, default was entered against Home Matters USA. On September 19,  the Whites submitted an application for default judgment. On September 27, the  Whites amended the Complaint to reflect that Home Matters USA was a business  name for Defendant South West Consulting Enterprises, Inc. On December 15, the  court denied the Whites’ application for default judgment. On  March 27, 2023, the Whites submitted a second application for default judgment.  But on April 26, the court directed the Whites to reserve Home Matters USA  under their correct name and resubmit their application if Home Matters USA  failed to appear. On the same day, the Whites’ process server served Home  Matters USA with substitute service in Los Angeles. On  July 21, 2023, default was entered against Home Matters USA. On July 24, the  Whites filed another application for default judgment. An  OSC Re: Default Judgment is set for November 1, 2023. LEGAL STANDARD Code  of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a  party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on  the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a  brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in  support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)  a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a  dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application  for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for  each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees  if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of  Court 3.1800.) ANALYSIS The  Whites seek default judgment against Home Matters USA in the total amount of $50,592.30,  including $42,474.70 in damages, $7,867.60 in interest, and $250 in costs. Because  the court finds the Whites have submitted sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS  their application with the following modifications. First,  while the Whites seek $42,474.70 in damages, the maximum amount requested in  their Complaint is only $32,474.70. (Complaint, ¶ 8.) A party may not obtain  damages in a default judgment that exceed the amount requested in the  complaint. (Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 826.) In determining  the maximum amount of damages allowable, “courts must look to the prayer of the  complaint¿or¿to ‘allegations in the body of the complaint of the damages  sought’ to determine whether a defendant has been informed of the ‘maximum  liability’ he or she will face for choosing to default.” (People ex rel.  Lockyer v. Brar (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 659, 667, quoting National  Diversified Services, Inc. v. Bernstein (1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 410,  417-418.) Allegations “according to proof” are insufficient in a default  judgment proceeding as they do not inform defendants of their maximum  liability. (Yu v. Liberty Surplus Ins. Corp. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 1024,  1032.) Thus, because the Whites only requested $32,474.70, the court will  not award damages in excess of that amount. Second,  while the Whites request $7,867.60 in interest, the court finds the correct  amount of interest is $7,865.11. Accordingly, the total judgment awarded to the  Whites is $40,589.81. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, the Whites’ application  for default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $40,589.81.  Plaintiffs to submit a revised judgment consistent with the court's ruling.
