 Case Number:  23PSCV01030    Hearing Date:   November 1, 2023    Dept:  G Plaintiff M&K, LLC’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees Respondent: Defendant Belle Gonzales  Halili TENTATIVE RULING Plaintiff M&K, LLC’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is  GRANTED in the reduced amount of  $26,795. BACKGROUND This  is an unlawful detainer action. In September 2016, Defendant Belle Gonzales  Halili agreed to lease a West Covina property from Plaintiff M&K, LLC  (M&K) for three years with a monthly rent of $3,375. The lease was extended  from October 2019 to September 2024 with monthly rent being increased to  $3,800. On February 23, 2023, Gonzales Halili failed to comply with a three-day  notice to quit or pay rent by M&K. At the time of the notice, Gonzales  Halili owed $45,600 in rent. On April  7, 2023, M&K filed a complaint against Gonzales Halili and Does 1-10 for  unlawful detainer. The court then held a bench trial and entered judgment in  favor of M&K on July 19. On  September 20, 2023, Gonzales Halili filed a motion to strike M&K’s costs.  On September 29, M&K filed the present motion. A hearing on M&K’s  motion is set for November 1 while a hearing on Gonzales Halili’s motion is set  for November 20. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE Gonzales  Halili requests judicial notice of this court’s ruling in another action  between the same parties. This request is DENIED as it is neither precedent nor binding  authority for this court. (B.F. v. Superior Court (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th  621, 627, fn. 2.) EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS Gonzales  Halili’s evidentiary objections to the declaration of M&K’s counsel are OVERRULED. ANALYSIS M&K  moves the court for an award of reasonable attorney fees in the amount of $65,208.  For the following reasons, the court GRANTS M&K’s motion in the reduced amount of $26,795. Legal Standard “Except as attorney’s fees  are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation  of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or  implied, of the parties; but parties to actions or proceedings are entitled to  their costs . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1021.)  The prevailing party on a  contract which specifically provides for attorney fees and costs incurred to  enforce the agreement is entitled to reasonable attorney fees in addition to  other costs.  (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1032,  1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(A).)  The court, upon notice and motion by a party,  shall determine the prevailing party and shall fix, as an element of the costs  of suit, the reasonable attorney fees.  (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a),  (b).) “The  amount to be awarded to a party as attorney fees is a matter within the sound  discretion of the trial judge.” (Contractors Labor Pool, Inc. v. Westway  Contractors, Inc. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 152, 168.) In determining the  reasonableness of an attorney fees award, the court considers “the nature,  difficulty, intricacy and importance of the litigation, the amount involved,  the skill required and success of the attorney's efforts, his or her learning,  age and experience, and the time consumed.” (Id., at p. 169.) Discussion M&K requests reasonable  attorney fees pursuant paragraph 31 of the lease agreement. In relevant part,  the provision states as follows: “Attorneys’  Fees. If any Party or Broker brings an action or proceeding involving the  Premises whether founded in tort, contract or equity, or to declare rights  hereunder, the Prevailing Party (as hereafter defined) in any such proceeding,  action, or appeal thereon, shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees. . .  . The term, ‘Prevailing Party’ shall include, without limitation, a Party or  Broker who substantially obtains or defeats the relief sought, as the case may  be, whether by compromise, settlement, judgment, or the abandonment by the  other Party or Broker of its claim or defense. . . .” (Symons Decl., Ex. E, ¶  31.) In  this case, the court issued a judgment for M&K that entitles M&K to  possession of the West Covina property, forfeiture of the lease, damages,  reasonable attorney fees, and costs. (8/25/2023 Amended Decision, p. 7.)  Because M&K was the only party who received relief in this action, the  court finds M&K is the prevailing party as defined in Civil Code section  1717, subdivision (b)(1). Here,  M&K’s counsel requests attorney fees for 104.4 hours of work billed at $570  per hour. (Symons Decl., ¶ 9, 12.) Because there was limited discovery and a  brief bench trial, the court finds a reduced hourly rate of $250 per hour is  reasonable. M&K’s counsel also requests an additional 10 hours for work on  this motion. (Symons Decl., ¶ 11.) But the court will reduce this to a  reasonable amount of 3.5 hours[1]  (1 hour for reviewing the opposition, 2 hours for drafting a reply, and 0.5  hours for attending the hearing). Accordingly, the court finds and awards  reasonable attorney fees in the amount of $26,795 at $250 an hour for 107.9  hours. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, M&K’s  motion for attorney fees is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $26,795.
