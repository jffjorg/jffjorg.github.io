And here is the summary text:

The Judge has denied Brenda E. Vargas' Motion to Intervene in the case. The motion was filed because Ms. Vargas claims to be the assignee of the breach of contract claim brought by Plaintiff Faustino Pacheco Morales against Defendants Ravit and Sharon Ohana. Ms. Vargas argues that she has a real, immediate, and concrete interest in the action because she purchased the debt from Plaintiff. However, the court denied the motion because Ms. Vargas failed to provide a copy of the agreement between her and Plaintiff, and also failed to provide a copy of the proposed complaint in intervention. Additionally, the court is unclear about the timeliness of the application.
