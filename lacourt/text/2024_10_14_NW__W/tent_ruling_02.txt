On January 25, 2024,
Plaintiff Americu Credit Union filed a complaint against Lateasha Deguzman Sutton
aka Lateasha D. Deguzman-Sutton for (1) Breach of Loan Agreement (Signature
Loan) (2) Account Stated (3) Money Lent (4) Breach of Loan Agreement (VISA) (5)
Account Stated and (6) Money Lent. 
 
Request for entry of
default was entered July 25, 2024. 
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: CONTINUE
 
Plaintiff has provided sufficient evidentiary and factual support
for the requested relief. However, Paragraph 12 of the Signature Loan Agreement
provides that the account must be used as personal family or household purposes
unless Americu gives written permission otherwise. Because of that, the 12.99%
interest appears to exceed the default judgment prejudgment interest rate of
10% for contract claims.  (See Civ. Code
§ 3287 et seq. and Cal. Const. Art. 15 § 1). “If interest is requested in
excess of the usury limitations of California Constitution Article XV, Section
1, proof must be presented of plaintiff’s exemption from the usury limitations
unless an exemption has been pleaded in the complaint and admitted by the entry
of default.” (Rule 3.206 new and effective July 1, 2011.)  Plaintiff must either recalculate the
interest based on 10%, or present evidence as to why it is exempt from the
usury limitations.
