And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to strike portions of the complaint. The motion is granted in part and denied in part. The defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's request for attorney fees is granted, as the plaintiff failed to identify a specific contractual or statutory basis for the request. The defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's allegations of back rent owed is also granted, as the amount appears to be miscalculated. However, the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's request for damages of $123,480.00 is denied, as the amount is not appropriate for adjudication with a motion to strike. The defendants are given 20 days to amend their pleadings in response to the ruling.
