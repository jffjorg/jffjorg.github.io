1.     
Avner Mandel, et
al.’s Motion to Strike Portions of Complaint
 
TENTATIVE RULING

Avner Mandel, et al.’s Motion to Strike Portions of
Complaint is granted with 20 days leave to amend, in part, and denied, in part.
 
 
Background 
 
Plaintiff filed the Complaint on April 9, 2024.
Plaintiff alleges the following facts. Plaintiff leased real property to
Defendants. Defendants failed to pay rent and failed to vacate the premises.
Plaintiff alleges causes of action for Breach of Contract and Common Counts. 
 
Meet and Confer
 
Defendants filed a meet and confer declaration in
sufficient compliance with CCP § 435.5. (Decl., Ali R. Kazempour.)
 
Motion to
Strike  
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading. 
CCP § 436(a).  The court may also
strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with
the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.  CCP § 436(b). 
The grounds for a motion to strike are that the pleading has irrelevant,
false or improper matter, or has not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws.  CCP § 436. 
The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading
or by way of judicial notice.  CCP § 437.

 
Defendants move to strike the following: “1. Page 2,
paragraph 10, line a: “…$123,480.00.” 2. Page 2, paragraph 10, lines c and
c(2): “attorney fees… according to proof.” 3. Page 3, paragraph BC-4, first
sentence: “…$14,400.00…” 4. Page 3, paragraph BC-4, first sentence: “In
addition to the back rent owed, totaling at least $14,400.00, Plaintiff had to
lease additional space beginning September 30, 2023.” 5. Page 3, paragraph
BC-4, second sentence: “Plaintiff had to enter into a long-term lease at this
alternative location at significant cost, according to proof.” 6. Page 3,
paragraph BC-5: “Plaintiff is entitled to attorney fees by an agreement or
statute… according to proof.” 7. Page 4, paragraph CC-2: “$14,400.” 8. Page 4,
paragraph CC-3: “Plaintiff is entitled to attorney fees by an agreement or
statute… according to proof.”” (Notice of Motion, page 2, lines 2-13.) 
 
As to Items 2, 6, and 8, the motion is granted with 20
days leave to amend. Plaintiff failed to identify a specific contractual or
statutory basis for the request for attorneys’ fees.
 
As to Items 3, 4, and 7, the motion is granted with 20
days leave to amend. Upon the face of the allegations of the Complaint, the
amount of back rent owed from May 1, 2023 to April 10, 2024 appears to be
miscalculated.
 
As to Items 1 and 5, the motion is denied. Defendants
rely on facts outside the scope of the pleadings in attempting to strike the
request for damages of $123,480.00. Whether Defendants will ultimately prove
this amount of damages through evidence and the application of proper legal
authority is not appropriate for adjudication with a motion to strike.
 
Defendants are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
