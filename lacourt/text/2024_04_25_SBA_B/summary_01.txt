The plaintiff has established causes of action for open book account and account stated, and the defendant has failed to raise a triable issue of material fact. The court finds that the plaintiff has met its burden of showing that there is no defense to its causes of action and that the defendant has not met his burden of presenting evidence to raise a triable issue of material fact. The motion for summary adjudication is moot in light of the ruling on the motion for summary judgment.
