[TENTATIVE] ORDER:   Plaintiff Golf Projects Lindero, Inc.’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatoreis, Set One, is
CONTINUED to ____________, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Dept. T.  The Court ORDERS a Joint Separate Statement
(i.e., a single brief) in compliance with California Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(c) to be filed nine court days prior to the new hearing date.  
Discussion
During a March 16, 2024 telephone
call between Mr. Salomons and Mr. Labrum, plaintiff claims Defendant asserted
that supplemental responses would be served by March 18, 2024 but none were
served.  However, Defendant asserted that
he had until March 25, 2024 to serve supplemental responses.  (Gary Salomons (Salomons) Decl. pars.
18-19.)  In support of Defendant’s
contention, Defendant submitted correspondence sent by Ms. Makovoz dated March
15, 2024 (the day before the Salomons/Labrum telephone call), showing that Ms.
Makovoz granted Defendant until March 25, 2024 to respond to the FI.  (Michael Labrum (Labrum) Decl. par. 2, Exh.
1.)  Despite Mr. Salomons contention
otherwise, the Court finds that Defendant had until March 25, 2024 to serve
supplemental responses to the FI.  
The motion’s separate statement
does not contain all the information necessary for the Court to rule upon the
discovery disputes.  Specifically,
Plaintiff’s Reply provided a copy of the March 25, 2024 Supplemental Responses
and Plaintiff’s arguments for further responses.  However, Defendant has been deprived of an
opportunity to submit their arguments against further responses.  
In order for Defendant to have
proper notice and opportunity to be heard on the issues related to the March
25, 2024 supplemental response, the motion is CONTINUED.
The parties are ORDERED to submit
a Joint Separate Statement (i.e., a single brief) providing all the required
contents listed in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(c) related to FI 4.1,
15.1, and 50.1.  The parties should take
care that California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(c)(2) requires the verbatim
“text of each response, answer, or objection, and any further responses or
answers.”  No other discovery demands are
to be added into the Joint Separate Statement.  
The Joint Separate Statement shall be filed nine court days prior to the
new hearing date.  
Issues as to monetary sanctions
are also CONTINUED to the new hearing date.
IT IS SO ORDERED, MOVING PARTY TO
GIVE NOTICE.
