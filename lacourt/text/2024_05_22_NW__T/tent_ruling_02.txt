 Case Number:  24VECV00780    Hearing Date:   May 22, 2024    Dept:  T 24VECV00780
Feigenbaum v. Loguidice
Tentative
ruling: Motion for trial setting preference: Denied.  Plaintiff makes this motion pursuant to CCP
section 36(e) which states that the court may grant trial setting preference
for reasons that satisfy the court that the interests of justice will be served
by granting this preference.  The reasons
given by plaintiff are that there would be economic hardship to plaintiff
because of loss of income and wage theft. 
The court finds that the interests of justice for all litigants in this department
would not be served by giving this case trial setting priority.
This
department has 1000 cases assigned to it. 
There are myriad types of cases including severely injured plaintiffs
from motor vehicle collisions and medical malpractice.  There are elder abuse cases including financial
elder abuse.  There are sexual assault
and harassment cases.  There are people
who have lost money from fraud and conversion. 
In other words, everyone who has a case in this department would have
compelling reasons to have their trials heard early.  Plaintiff’s case here is the same as most
other plaintiffs.  There is no reason in
which this case should have priority over the other 1000 cases which will be assigned
or have been assigned trial dates. Some cases are 2-3 years old. The usual practice
is that a Trial Setting Conference will be set 6 months from the filing of the
answer and a Trial date will be set 6 months from the Trial Setting Conference,
which means the case will go to trial approximately 1 year after the answer was
filed or in approximately March 2025. 
The court also notes that plaintiff filed two lawsuits against
defendant, one on 2/21/2024 at 10:35 a.m. (24VECV00776) and one on 2/21/2024 at
11:35 a.m. (this case, 24VECV780) which is active.  The court sets an Order to Show Cause why
both cases should not be consolidated for all purposes under the 24VECV00780
case number (as they appear to be the same case) for _____, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
in Dept. T.  Any objection to
consolidation shall be file 5 court days before the hearing. Verbatim notice of ruling shall be served by defendant.
