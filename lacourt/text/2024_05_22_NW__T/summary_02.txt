And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for trial setting preference filed by plaintiff Feigenbaum against defendant Loguidice. The plaintiff argues that the court should grant priority to her case due to economic hardship caused by loss of income and wage theft. However, the judge finds that the interests of justice would not be served by giving this case priority over the other 1000 cases in the department. The judge notes that the department has a wide range of cases, including severe injuries, elder abuse, and fraud, and that every case has compelling reasons for an early trial date. The judge denies the motion for trial setting preference and instead sets an order to show cause for consolidation of two lawsuits filed by the plaintiff against the defendant.
