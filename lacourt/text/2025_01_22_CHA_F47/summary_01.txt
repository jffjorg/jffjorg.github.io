And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a motion filed by Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital (Henry Mayo) to file a cross-complaint against TLC Travel Staff, LLC (TLC). The motion was filed on June 26, 2024, and no opposition was filed. Henry Mayo seeks to file a cross-complaint against TLC, alleging that TLC is liable for Henry Mayo's failure to timely diagnose and treat signs and symptoms of fetal distress during a labor and delivery on July 18, 2022. The judge found that it is in the interests of justice and judicial economy to allow Henry Mayo to file the cross-complaint in this action, rather than filing a separate action. Henry Mayo must separately file the cross-complaint and serve it on all parties in compliance with California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) 428.60.
