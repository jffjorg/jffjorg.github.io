May 22, 2023, Plaintiff Maidia Leola Stillitano (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Juventina Acosta Funez (“Acosta”), Jorge Hernandez
(“Hernandez”), and Does 1-25 for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. 
On
June 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed proofs of service showing substituted service on Acosta
and Hernandez of the summons, complaint, statement of damages, and other documents
on May 31, 2023.  On July 24, 2023, Plaintiff
filed amended proofs of service. 
On
July 24, 2023, the clerk entered Acosta’s and Hernandez’s defaults. 
On
November 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed a request for Court judgment to be heard on
January 24, 2024. 
On
December 5, 2023, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
Maidia Leola Stillitano requests that the Court enter a default judgment
against Defendants Juventina Acosta Funez and Jorge Hernandez and award
Plaintiff $321,421.70, consisting of $250,000.00 in general damages, $70,831.29
in special damages, $0.00 in prejudgment interest, $0.00 in attorney’s fees, and
$590.41 in costs.
LEGAL STANDARD 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties and
the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal
of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for
separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section
579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
          “Where a cause of action is stated in the complaint,
plaintiff merely needs to introduce evidence establishing a prima facie case
for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow,
Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal. Practice Guide), citing Johnson
v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred in applying
preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
          The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a
defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or, for
personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494 (Becker).) The statute insures that “defendants in cases
which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may
be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is
demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in
court—a right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p.
493.) A trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of
the amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at
p. 494; see Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:258,
p. 5-70.) 
DISCUSSION 
Section
8 of Plaintiff’s CIV-100 form, the declaration of nonmilitary status, states
only that “Defendant indicated she was not a US resident and did not have a
license.”  Plaintiff is seeking judgment
against two defendants.  Plaintiff has not
provided a declaration of nonmilitary status for Hernandez. 
Plaintiff
has filed proof of service of statements of damages on both defendants but has
not submitted copies of the statements of damages to the Court. Plaintiff
should submit copies of the statements of damages to enable the Court to
confirm that the damages Plaintiff is seeking in the request for default judgment
do not exceed the amounts listed in the statements of damages. 
Plaintiff
requests $70,831.29 in special damages.  According
to Plaintiff, this amount includes $15,654.09 in medical expenses, $25,117.20 in
lost wages, $20,000.00 in future medical expenses, and $10,000.00 future lost
earnings.  (When these amounts are added
together, the total is $60.00 less than $70,831.29, the amount of special
damages Plaintiff requests.)  However,
Plaintiff has not provided evidence supporting the amounts she is requesting
for future medical expenses and future lost earnings. 
The
Court denies the motion without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Maidia Leola Stillitano’s application for default
judgment filed on November 29, 2023 without prejudice. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
