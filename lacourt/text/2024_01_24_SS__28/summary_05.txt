Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion of Defendant Ralphs Grocery Company dba Ralphs to compel Plaintiff Kaveh Kavian to attend his deposition and orders Plaintiff to attend his deposition within 45 days of the hearing. The judge also grants Defendant's request for sanctions and orders Plaintiff and his counsel to pay Defendant $1,050.00 within 30 days of the hearing. The judge denies Plaintiff's request for sanctions. The ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, which requires a party to set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice. The judge finds that Plaintiff's counsel confirmed availability for deposition and that Plaintiff failed to appear for deposition, and therefore, the motion is granted.
