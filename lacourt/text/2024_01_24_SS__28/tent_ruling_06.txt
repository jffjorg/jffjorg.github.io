LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order
compelling a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including
the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent exceptional
circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or any attorney
of a party for failure to provide electronically stored information that has
been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of the routine, good
faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides: 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.220 provides: 
“(a) Each answer in a response to interrogatories
shall be as complete and straightforward as the information reasonably
available to the responding party permits. 
“(b) If an interrogatory cannot be answered
completely, it shall be answered to the extent possible. 
“(c) If the responding party does not have personal
knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an interrogatory, that party shall so
state, but shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the
information by inquiry to other natural persons or organizations, except where
the information is equally available to the propounding party.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.220.) 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300 provides: 
“(a) On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the
propounding party deems that any of the following apply: 
“(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is
evasive or incomplete. 
“(2) An exercise of the option to produce documents
under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those
documents is inadequate. 
“(3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit
or too general. 
“(b) (1) A motion under subdivision (a) shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040. 
“(2) In lieu of a separate statement required under
the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a
concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute. 
“(c) Unless notice of this motion is given within 45
days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding
party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party
waives any right to compel a further response to the interrogatories. 
“(d) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further
response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust. 
“(e) If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
further response to interrogatories, the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
lieu of, or in addition to, that sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.300.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to form
interrogatories 
On
April 19, 2023, Plaintiff served form interrogatories, set one, on Hanhil.  On May 23, 2023, Hanhil served
responses.  Plaintiff met and conferred
with Hanhil about the responses.  On
September 20, 2023, the parties participated in an informal discovery conference
with the Court.  On October 11, 2023,
Hanhil served further responses. 
Plaintiff’s
counsel attempted to meet and confer with Hanhil’s counsel about the adequacy
of Hanhil’s further responses.  Hanhil did
not provide additional responses by the time Plaintiff filed this motion. 
In
his opposing declaration, Hanhil’s counsel asserts that Hanhil’s further
responses served on October 11, 2023 were adequate and Plaintiff was required
to schedule an additional informal discovery conference if Plaintiff wished to
challenge the adequacy of the further responses. 
The
Court grants the motion to compel further responses.  Hanhil’s original and further responses did
not answer the “subparts” of the questions.  No additional informal discovery conference was
required.  
The
Court orders Hanhil to provide further verified, code-compliant responses to form
interrogatories, set one (number 17.1) by February 23, 2024. 
Plaintiff
requests sanctions of $561.65 in sanctions. 
Counsel spent approximately 3.0 hours engaging in the meet and confer
process (including the IDC) and approximately 2.0 hours in preparing the motion.  Counsel’s billing rate is $500 per hour.  Plaintiff also requests $61.65 in filing fees. 
The
Court does not award sanctions for meeting and conferring.  The Court awards $561.65 in sanctions based
on two hours of attorney time at a reasonable rate of $250 per hour and one
filing fee. 
B.   Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to requests for
production of documents and special interrogatories 
On
October 11, 2023, Plaintiff served requests for production of documents, set two,
and special interrogatories, set two, on Hanhil.  Hanhil did not serve timely responses and had
not served responses by the time Plaintiff filed these motions on December 7,
2023. 
On
December 29, 2023, Hanhil served responses to the requests for production of
documents and special interrogatories. 
The responses are code-compliant and contain no objections.  Therefore, Plaintiff’s motions are moot with
respect to the requests to compel responses to the discovery. 
Sanctions
are not available because Hanhil has not unsuccessfully made or opposed a
motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff Euler Angel Valverde Garcia’s
motion to compel Defendant Hanhil Properties, Inc.’s further responses to form
interrogatories, set one (number 17.1) and orders Defendant Hanhil Properties,
Inc. to provide further verified, code-compliant responses by February 23,
2024. 

The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Euler Angel Valverde Garcia’s request for sanctions on
the motion to compel Defendant Hanhil Properties, Inc.’s further responses to
form interrogatories, set one (number 17.1) and orders Defendant Hanhil
Properties, Inc. and its counsel to pay Plaintiff Euler Angel Valverde Garcia
$561.65 by February 23, 2024. 
The
Court DENIES as moot Plaintiff Euler Angel Valverde Garcia’s motion to compel
Defendant Hanhil Properties, Inc.’s responses to request for production of
documents, set two, and denies Plaintiff’s request for sanctions. 
The
Court DENIES as moot Plaintiff Euler Angel Valverde Garcia’s motion to compel
Defendant Hanhil Properties, Inc.’s responses to special interrogatories, set
two, and denies Plaintiff’s request for sanctions. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
