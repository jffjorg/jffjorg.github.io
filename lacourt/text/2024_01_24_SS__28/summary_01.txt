And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. The plaintiff, Corentin Villemeur, filed a complaint against the defendant, Elvis Orlando Guevara Vasquez, on July 15, 2020, alleging motor vehicle negligence, negligence entrustment of vehicle, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, hit and run, with punitive damages. The plaintiff later filed an amended complaint. After the defendant's default was entered, the court dismissed the action without prejudice on March 1, 2023. The plaintiff then filed a motion to vacate the dismissal, which was continued to January 24, 2024.

The plaintiff's counsel submitted a declaration stating that counsel inadvertently failed to appear at the March 1, 2023 hearing due to a miscalendared hearing date, resulting in the dismissal. The judge finds that the dismissal was the result of attorney mistake. Therefore, the court grants the motion to vacate the dismissal and sets a hearing on the OSC Re: Dismissal for Failure to Enter Default Judgment for February 23, 2024.
