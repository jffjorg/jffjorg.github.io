PROPOSED SETTLEMENT:
$3,000.00 
INJURIES:
Back and neck pain 
MEDICAL
EXPENSES: $800.00 
COSTS:
$200.00 
ATTORNEY’S
FEES: $1,000.00, which is 33% of the gross settlement 
BALANCE
OF PROCEEDS: $1,000.00 
DISCUSSION: 
Petitioner
requests $200.00 in costs for “litigation/administrative expenses.” Petitioner
should provide information supporting this request.  (The Court notes that the petition includes a
December 19, 2023 document titled “Settlement Distribution,” which Plaintiff and
his guardian ad litem signed, stating that litigation/administrative expenses
would be $130.25.) 
Counsel
has requested an attorney’s fee award of $1,000.00, which is one third of the $3,000.00
gross settlement amount.  Counsel notes
that Petitioner approved the retainer agreement that supports this request. 
California
Rules of Court, rule 7.955, “requires a trial court, in determining reasonable
attorney fees, to balance an attorney's interest in fair compensation with the
protection of the interests of a minor client. Thus, a trial court ‘must give
consideration to the terms of any representation agreement made between the
attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a disability and
must evaluate the agreement based on the facts and circumstances existing at
the time the agreement was made.’ ” (Schulz v. Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc.
(2018) 27 Cal.App.5th 1167, 1176-1177 (Schultz), quoting Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 7.955(a)(2).) 
The
Court has considered the factors listed in rule 7.955 and concludes that an
attorney’s fee award of 30 percent is reasonable in this case.  (See Schultz, supra, 27
Cal.App.5th at p. 1175 [“Even if there is no benchmark starting point for
attorney fees in cases under California Rules of Court, rule 7.955, a court may
of course reasonably determine that 25 percent is an appropriate percentage in
a given case”].) 
Therefore,
the attorney’s fee award will be $900.00, which is 30 percent of the gross
settlement amount. 
The
Court denies the petition without prejudice.
