And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

This is a tentative ruling on an expedited petition without a hearing, which is permitted under California Rules of Court, rule 7.950.5. The petition is brought by Beatriz Cortez Pacheco, represented by an attorney, and seeks a settlement of $3,000.00 for the claimant, Gabino Chavez, who tripped on a spilled bottle of fabric softener and suffered from back and neck pain. The settlement includes medical expenses of $800.00, costs of $200.00, and attorney's fees of $1,000.00, which is 33% of the gross settlement amount. However, the court denies the petition without prejudice, as the attorney's fee award is reduced to $900.00, which is 30% of the gross settlement amount, in accordance with California Rules of Court, rule 7.955. The court also requests that the petitioner provide information supporting their request for $200.00 in costs for "litigation/administrative expenses."
