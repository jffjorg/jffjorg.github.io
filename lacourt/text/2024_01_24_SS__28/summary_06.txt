And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the motions to compel responses from Hanhil Properties, Inc. The court grants the motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories, set one, and orders Hanhil to provide further verified, code-compliant responses by February 23, 2024. The court also awards sanctions of $561.65 to the plaintiff.

The court denies as moot the motions to compel responses to requests for production of documents, set two, and special interrogatories, set two, since Hanhil has already served code-compliant responses.

The court also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions in these two matters.
