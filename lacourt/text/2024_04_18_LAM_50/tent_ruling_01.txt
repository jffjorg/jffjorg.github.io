[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: 
 
DEFENDANTS JESSE
  FRENCH, KYLE TRACY AND SHANE V. HAPUARACHY’S MOTION TO BIFURCATE PUNITIVE
  DAMAGE PHASE OF ACTION PURSUANT TO CIVIL CODE SECTION
  3295
 




 
            Background
Plaintiff Christina Garcia (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on November
2, 2018 against a number of Defendants, including, inter alia, Jesse E.
French, Esq., Kyle Tracy Esq., and Shane V. Hapuarachy, Esq. 
Plaintiff filed the operative Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”) on
August 19, 2020. The TAC alleges causes of action for (1) legal malpractice and
(2) breach of fiduciary duty. In the TAC, Plaintiff alleges that she seeks, inter
alia, punitive damages. (TAC, p. 33:13.) 
Jesse French, Kyle Tracy, and Shane Hapuarachy (collectively, the
“Moving Parties”) now move for an order (1) “[p]recluding plaintiff, her
counsel and all witnesses from offering any evidence or making any statements
in the presence of the jury concerning Jesse French, Kyle Tracy and Shane
Hapuarachy’s profits or financial condition until after the trier of fact
returns a verdict for plaintiffs awarding actual damages and finds that Jesse
French, Kyle Tracy and Shane Hapuarachy are guilty of malice, oppression or
fraud in accordance with Civil Code section 3295,
subdivision (d),” (2) “[t]o have all court documents which go before the
trier of fact scrutinized and corrected so as to adhere to the previous
instruction,” and (3) “[t]o preclude plaintiff or her counsel from referring to
the fact that this Motion has been filed or granted.” The motion is unopposed. 
Discussion 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1048,
subdivision (b) provides: “[t]he court, in furtherance
of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive
to expedition and economy, may order a separate trial of any cause of action,
including a cause of action asserted in a cross-complaint, or of any separate
issue or of any number of causes of action or issues, preserving the right of
trial by jury required by the Constitution or a statute of this state or of the
United States.” ((Id., § 1048, subd. (b).) 
Code
of Civil Procedure sections 597 and 598 allow a court to order that the trial of any issue or part thereof
proceed before the trial of any other issue to promote the ends of justice or
the economy and efficiency of handling the litigation. Additionally, Evidence Code section 320 provides
that trial courts have discretion to regulate the order of proof. “[T]rial
courts have broad discretion to determine the order of proof in the interests
of judicial economy.” ((Grappo v. Coventry
Fin. Corp. (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d
496, 504.) The objective of bifurcation is “avoidance
of the waste of time and money caused by the unnecessary trial of damage
questions in cases where the liability issue is resolved against the plaintiff.”
((Horton v. Jones (1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 952, 955.)
Civil Code section 3295, subdivision (d) provides that “[t]he court shall, on application of any defendant,
preclude the admission of evidence of that defendant’s profits or financial
condition until after the trier of fact returns a verdict for plaintiff
awarding actual damages and finds that a defendant is guilty of malice,
oppression, or fraud in accordance with Section 3294.”
Civil Code section 3295, subdivision (d) goes on to state that “[e]vidence of profit and financial condition
shall be admissible only as to the defendant or defendants found to be liable
to the plaintiff and to be guilty of malice, oppression, or fraud.” This
section “requires a court, upon application of any defendant, to bifurcate a
trial so that the trier of fact is not presented with evidence of the
defendant’s wealth and profits until after the issues of liability,
compensatory damages, and malice, oppression, or fraud have been resolved
against the defendant.” ((Torres v. Automobile
Club of So. California (1997) 15
Cal.4th 771, 777-778.) 
Accordingly, the Court
finds that the punitive damages phase of trial must be bifurcated from the rest
of trial. Evidence of the profits and financial condition of each of the
Moving Parties will not be
admissible at trial “until after the trier of
fact returns a verdict for plaintiff awarding actual damages and finds that
[such moving party] is guilty of malice, oppression, or fraud in accordance
with Section 3294.” (Civ. Code, § 3295, subd. (d).) 
As set forth
above, the Moving Parties also request an order “[t]o have all
court documents which go before the trier of fact scrutinized and corrected so
as to adhere to the previous instruction.” (Notice of Mot. at p. 2:8-9.) In
addition, the Moving Parties seek an order “[t]o preclude plaintiff or her
counsel from referring to the fact that this Motion has been filed or granted.”
(Notice of Mot. at p. 2:10-11.) The Moving Parties do not appear to cite any
legal authority to support such requests. Accordingly, the Court denies these
requests. 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing,
the Court grants the Moving Parties’ motion in part. The issue of the amount of punitive damages will not
be tried and evidence of the Moving Parties’ profits and financial condition will not be admitted unless and until the trier of fact
returns a verdict for Plaintiff awarding actual damages and finds that the Moving
Parties are
guilty of malice, oppression, or fraud in accordance with Civil Code section 3294. 
The
Moving Parties’ motion is otherwise denied, as set forth above.
