Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The judge has overruled the demurrer to the second cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, finding that the complaint adequately pleads a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress, finding that negligent infliction of emotional distress is not an independent tort and that the plaintiff's claim is based on the defendants' alleged breach of a duty to the plaintiff, which is not alleged in the complaint.

The judge has also denied the motion to strike the second cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress and granted the motion to strike the fourth cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress.

The plaintiff has 14 days to file an amended pleading, if desired. The defendants must file their answer to the operative complaint within 30 days of the ruling.
