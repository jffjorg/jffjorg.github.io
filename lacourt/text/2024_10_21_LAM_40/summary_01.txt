Summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion to enforce a court order and a motion for terminating sanctions filed by the defendants, Clifford Harris, Tameka Harris, and Shekinah Jones Anderson. The plaintiffs, Sabrina Peterson, failed to pay attorneys' fees and costs of $96,702.70 ordered by the court on October 17, 2023. The defendants argue that they are entitled to an entry of judgment for attorneys' fees and costs and request terminating sanctions dismissing the two remaining causes of action with prejudice. The court denies the motion to enforce the court order, finding that the award of attorneys' fees and costs originated in the anti-SLAPP statute and are not immediately enforceable as a separate judgment. The court also denies the motion for terminating sanctions, citing the recent substitution of attorney and leaving the option open for the defendants to file a further motion for terminating sanctions if Peterson fails to prosecute the case. The trial date set for December 10, 2024, remains firm.
