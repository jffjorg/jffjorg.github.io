Counsel Smith complied with the requirements of California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 by serving the plaintiffs and defendants via email and mail, and by filing the required forms. The judge finds that relief is appropriate under the circumstances and grants the motion, effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed order upon the client.
