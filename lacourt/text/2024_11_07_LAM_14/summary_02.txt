And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the Plaintiffs' motion to compel the deposition of Defendant's Person Most Qualified (PMQ), Bryan Jensen. The Plaintiffs had filed a motion to compel the deposition after Defendant refused to produce a witness for certain categories. The Judge notes that Defendant's objections to the deposition notice were waived because they did not serve objections to the second amended notice of deposition in a timely manner.

The Judge finds that Defendant failed to proceed with the deposition by failing to produce a witness for the requested categories. The Judge also rejects Defendant's argument that the information sought is not relevant, finding that information about other vehicles is relevant to the dispute. Finally, the Judge rejects Defendant's argument that certain information is trade secret material, finding that it is already protected by a protective order.

As a result, the Judge grants the Plaintiffs' motion to compel the deposition of Defendant's PMQ, but does not award sanctions to the Plaintiffs. The hearing date for this motion is set for November 7, 2024.
