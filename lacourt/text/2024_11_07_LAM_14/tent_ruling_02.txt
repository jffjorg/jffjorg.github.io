Plaintiffs move to compel the deposition of Defendant’s
PMQ.
Decision

Defendant’s PMQ is GRANTED.
Legal Standard
Any
party may obtain discovery, subject to restrictions, by taking the oral
deposition of any person, including any party to the action. (Code Civ. Proc., section
2025.010.) A properly served deposition notice is effective to require a party
to attend and to testify, as well as to produce documents for inspection and
copying. (Code Civ. Proc., section 2025.280, subd. (a).) The party served with
a deposition notice waives any error or irregularity unless that party promptly
serves a written objection at least three calendar days prior to the date for
which the deposition is scheduled. (Code Civ. Proc., section 2025.410, subd.
(a).) 
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action … without having
served a valid objection … fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with
it, or to produce for inspection any document, … described in the deposition
notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the
deponent's attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any
document … described in the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., section
2025.450, subd. (a).)  
Discussion
The
Court first notes that it is now less than 30 days before trial, meaning
discovery is closed. However, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion to advance
the hearing date on this motion and will rule on this dispute.
Plaintiffs’
counsel, Vanessa Oliva, alleges that she originally noticed the deposition of
Defendant’s PMQ, Bryan Jensen, in February 2023. (Oliva Decl., ¶19.) Defendant
refused to produce a witness for categories 6, 8-9, 11-13, 15-16, 18-19, 21-22
and 24-27, and refused to give Plaintiffs Jensen’s availability. (Id.,
¶18.) On August 9, 2024, Plaintiffs served an amended notice of deposition. (Id.,
¶24.) On August 14, 2024, Plaintiffs served a second amended notice of
deposition setting the deposition for the new agreed date of August 20, 2024. (Id.,
¶25.) Oliva took Jensen’s first deposition on August 20, 2024. (Id., ¶26.)
Defendant did not serve a response or objections to the second amended notice.
(Id., ¶27.) Jensen only testified as to categories 1-4, 7, 14, and 20 at his
deposition. (Id., ¶26.)
Defendant
first argues that its objections to the deposition notice were not waived.
Defendant alleges that it did not object to the second amended deposition
notice due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. However, this
standard only appears in statutes governing written discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., sections 2030.290, 2031.300, and 2033.280.) Code Civ. Proc., section
2025.410 provides that objections to any error or irregularity with a
deposition notice must be served at least three calendar days before the
deposition date, or the objections are waived. The section does not contain any
provisions allowing relief from waiver of objections. Here, Defendant’s
objections to the deposition notice were waived because it did not serve timely
objections.
The
Court notes that the August 14, 2024, second amended notice of deposition was
served less than 10 days before the deposition date. However, any objection to
the timeliness of the notice was waived when Defendant failed to respond to the
notice. In any event, the second amended notice includes the same categories as
the first amended notice. The only change appears to be the date of the
deposition, which both parties agreed to. Thus, the deposition was properly
noticed.
Defendant
next argues that Plaintiffs’ notice seeks information that is not relevant
because Plaintiffs do not need information about other consumers or vehicles.
Information about whether a violation of the Song Beverly Act was willful is
relevant to whether a defendant is liable for a civil penalty. (Oregel¿v.
American Isuzu Motors, Inc.¿(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1094.) Here, information
about other vehicles is relevant to whether Defendant was aware of defects in
vehicles of the same year, make, and model as Plaintiffs’ vehicle and willfully
refused to repurchase the vehicle. Defendant’s argument with respect to
relevance is without merit.
Finally, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs impermissibly
seek production of trade secret material. This argument is without merit
because, as Plaintiffs point out, there is already a protective order in place
shielding trade secret material from discovery. 
The Court finds Defendant failed to proceed with a
deposition by failing to produce a witness for categories 6, 8-9, 11-13, 15-16, 18-19, 21-22 and 24-27. Defendant
waived objections to the notice by failing to serve objections to the second
amended notice of deposition. Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion to compel the
deposition of Defendant’s PMQ is GRANTED. Plaintiffs do not seek sanctions.
Conclusion
Plaintiffs’ motion to compel the deposition of
Defendant’s PMQ is GRANTED.
