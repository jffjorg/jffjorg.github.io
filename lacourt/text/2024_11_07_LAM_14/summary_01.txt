And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint is overruled. The plaintiff's claims for breach of the warranty of habitability, violation of Civil Code section 1942.4, nuisance, and negligence are considered sufficient to state a cause of action. The judge found that the plaintiff's allegations of habitability issues, including a lack of adequate heating and ventilation, a lack of fire and carbon monoxide alarms, and defective electrical outlets, are sufficient to state a cause of action for nuisance. Additionally, the judge found that the plaintiff's allegations of the defendant's negligent conduct in maintaining and managing the property are sufficient to state a cause of action for negligence. The defendant is ordered to answer the complaint within 10 days of notice of the court's order.
