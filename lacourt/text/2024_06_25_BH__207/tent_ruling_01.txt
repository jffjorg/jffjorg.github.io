OPPOSING PARTY


Cross-Complainant 4711 Berryman, LLC



 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Francisco Barron (“Plaintiff”) worked for FR Construction,
Inc. (“FR Construction”) as a laborer.  In
August or September of 2020, FR Construction secured a “job” at 4711 Berryman
Ave in Culver City, California.  The
owner of the property at that time was 4711 Berryman LLC (“Berryman”). 
 
On September 16 2020, Plaintiff and other workers were instructed to
fix some tile, pipes and grout. The work was situated on the exterior of the project
about 10 feet above ground level. There was no scaffolding or ladders present.  Rodriguez directed the workers to place
several garbage bins in a line and place wooden planks across the garbage bins
so that the workers could reach the work area. While working on top of the
planks, on top of garbage bins, the contraption gave way.  Plaintiff was on top of one area and fell to
ground about 8 feet and landed on his leg, breaking it.  
 
FR Construction and Francisco Rodriguez (“Rodriguez”), the principal
of FR Construction, did not maintain either workers’ compensation insurance or general
liability insurance, among other alleged shortcomings in their business
practices.  Plaintiff filed suit against
FR Construction, Rodriguez and Berryman on September 15, 2022 alleging various
claims under the Labor Code including a failure to maintain workers'
compensation insurance coverage.  
 
On May 6, 2024, Berryman filed an Amended Cross-Complaint alleging eight
causes of action for (1) indemnity; (2) apportionment of fault; (3) comparative
fault; (4) declaratory relief; (5) intentional misrepresentation; (6) negligent
misrepresentation; (6) negligence; and (7) indemnity.[1]
 
Cross-Defendant State Compensation Insurance Fund (“State Fund”) now
demurs to the first, second, third, fourth, seventh, and eighth causes of
action alleged in the First Amended Cross-Complaint (“FACC”) on the grounds
that they fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and
are uncertain under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivisions (e)
and (f), respectively.  The fifth and
sixth causes of action are alleged as to Cross-Defendants Icon Remodeling, Inc.
(“Icon”) and Yoni Eliyaho only.  
 
4711 Berryman opposes the demurrer and State Fund replies.
 
ANALYSIS
 
1.     DEMURRER
 
“It is black letter law that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of
the allegations in a complaint.”  (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015)
235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  In testing the sufficiency of a cause of
action, a court accepts “[a]s true all material facts properly pled and matters
which may be judicially noticed but disregard contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.  [A court
also gives] the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole
and its parts in their context.”  (290
Division (EAT), LLC v. City & County of San Francisco (2022) 86
Cal.App.5th 439, 450 [cleaned up]; Hacker v. Homeward Residential, Inc.
(2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 270, 280 [“in considering the merits of a demurrer,
however, “the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however
improbable they may be”].)
 
Further, in ruling on a demurrer, a court must “liberally construe”
the allegations of the complaint “with a view to substantial justice between
the parties.”  (See Code Civ. Proc., §
452.)  “This rule of liberal construction
means that the reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not
the defendant.”  (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.)   
 
In summary, “[d]etermining whether the complaint is sufficient as
against the demurrer on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action, the rule is that if on consideration of all the
facts stated it appears the plaintiff is entitled to any relief at the hands of
the court against the defendants the complaint will be held good although the
facts may not be clearly stated, or may be intermingled with a statement of
other facts irrelevant to the cause of action shown, or although the plaintiff
may demand relief to which he is not entitled under the facts alleged.”  (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193
Cal.App.2d 636, 639.)
 
A.   
UNCERTAINTY
 
“[D]emurrers for uncertainty are disfavored.”  (Lickiss v. Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135.)  A demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained
only where the pleading is so bad that the responding party cannot reasonably
respond - i.e., he or she cannot reasonably determine what issues must be
admitted or denied, or what claims are directed against him or her.  (Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993)
14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  Where a
demurrer is made upon the ground of uncertainty, the demurrer must distinctly
specify exactly how or why the pleading is uncertain, and where such
uncertainty appears by reference to page and line numbers.  (See Fenton v. Groveland Comm.
Services Dist. (1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 797, 809.)  
 
State Fund argues that the allegations are uncertain because it is
unclear which Cross-Defendant is allegedly responsible for which acts.
 
Following the Court’s sustaining of State Fund’s prior demurrer, 4711
Berryman has added the following allegations with respect to State Fund:
 
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST STATE COMPENSATION FUND

 
24. Cross-Defendant STATE COMPENSATION INSURANCE
FUND (“SCIF”) is a worker’s compensation carrier which insured Cross-Defendant
ICON REMODELING, INC. at the time of Plaintiff’s alleged injury. 
 
25. At the time of his alleged injury, Plaintiff
was either an employee of Cross-Defendant ICON REMODELING, INC. or a subsidiary
thereof, as California Courts have determined that under Labor Code section
2750.5, employees of an unlicensed subcontractor are statutory employees of the
general contractor. 
 
26. Even though Plaintiff was an employee of
SCIF’s insured at the time he allegedly suffered a work injury, SCIF has
refused to provide coverage for Plaintiff’s injury. 
 
27. Because SCIF has wrongfully refused to
provide coverage for Plaintiff’s injuries, Plaintiff has therefore brought this
civil action in an attempt to collect reimbursement for his alleged injuries. 
 
28. In fact, Plaintiff has informed
Cross-Complainant that if SCIF changes course and provides coverage for his
injuries, then Plaintiff will dismiss this action (or at least dismiss Cross-Complainant).

 
29. As such, it is SCIF’s wrongful actions that
are the direct and proximate cause of Cross-Complainant’s inclusion in this
action and the resulting attorney’s fees and costs that Cross-Complainant has
suffered in order to defend itself and assert its crossclaims.
 
(FACC
¶¶ 24-29.)
 
            Thus, it is clear that 4711
Berryman’s theory of liability against State Fund is that it “wrongfully denied
Plaintiff’s claims for injuries[.]” 
(FACC ¶ 31.)  Accordingly, State
Farm does not demonstrate that the FACC is so bad that State Farm cannot
reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied or what claims are
directed against it.  The Court thus
declines to sustain State Fund’s demurrer on the basis of uncertainty.
 
B.   
FAILURE TO STATE A CAUSE OF ACTION
 
“The elements of any negligence
cause of action are duty, breach of duty, proximate cause, and damages.”  (Peredia v. HR Mobile Services, Inc.
(2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 680, 687.)
 
Similarly, 4711 Berryman seeks
indemnity and declaratory relief under a theory of comparative/apportionment of
fault that State Fund’s negligence contributed to the Plaintiff’s harm.  (See Opp. at p. 5.)   Thus,
4711 Berryman’s allegations against State Fund all rest on State Fund’s alleged
negligence.
 
But State Fund argues it owed
no duty to 4711 Berryman because there is no contractual or insurer-insured
relationship alleged between State Fund and 4711 Berryman, and 4711 Berryman’s
allegations do not assert otherwise.  The
Court agrees.  
 
In the FACC, 4711 Berryman
alleges as follows:
 
60. Cross-Defendants owed a duty to
Cross-Complainant to follow all applicable statutes, rules, and regulations for
the renovations and construction at the Subject Property and to carry the
necessary and appropriate insurance, including workers' comp insurance. 
 
61. Cross-Defendants were negligent in fulfilling
this duty. 
 
62. Cross-Complainant was harmed. 
 
63. Cross-Defendants’ negligence was a
substantial factor in causing Cross-Complainant’s harm
 
(FACC ¶¶ 60-63.)  
 
            As
the insurer, State Fund is not alleged to have violated any statutes, rules, or
regulations for the renovation and construction at the subject property.  Nor would State Fund be obligated to carry
“the necessary and appropriate insurance, including workers’ comp
insurance.”  Thus, in reading the FACC in
full and context, the Court finds that the allegations set forth in paragraphs
60-63 pertain to the Cross-Defendants directly involved in the construction
project, not to State Farm, the alleged workers’ compensation insurance carrier.
 
            Furthermore,
“Negligence is not among the theories of recovery generally available against insurers.”  (See Sanchez v. Lindsey Morden Claims
Servs., Inc. (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 249, 254, citing Croskey et al., Cal.
Practice Guide: Insurance Litigation 2 (The Rutter Group 1998) ¶¶ 12:818,
11:205, pp. 12C-6, 11-48 to 11-49, rev. #1, 1996] [outlining the few
exceptions, such as duty to defend, not relevant here].)
 
            Therefore,
4711 Berryman has not alleged that insurer State Fund owed it any duty.  As such, the FACC fails to state facts sufficiently
to support any of the causes of action alleged against State Fund.
 
2.    
LEAVE TO AMEND
 
A plaintiff has the burden of showing in what
manner the complaint could be amended and how the amendment would change the
legal effect of the complaint, i.e., state a cause of action. (See The
Inland Oversight Committee v. City of San Bernardino (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th
771, 779; PGA West Residential Assn., Inc. v. Hulven Int'l, Inc. (2017)
14 Cal.App.5th 156, 189.) A plaintiff must not only state the legal basis for
the amendment, but also the factual allegations sufficient to state a cause of
action or claim. (See PGA West Residential Assn., Inc. v. Hulven Int'l, Inc.,
supra, 14 Cal.App.5th at p. 189.) Moreover, a plaintiff does not meet his
or her burden by merely stating in the opposition to a demurrer or motion to
strike that “if the Court finds the operative complaint deficient, plaintiff
respectfully requests leave to amend.” (See Major Clients Agency v Diemer
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1133; Graham v. Bank of America (2014) 226
Cal.App.4th 594, 618 [asserting an abstract right to amend does not satisfy the
burden].)
 
Here, 4711 Berryman indicates it has additional facts to plead to
establish that Plaintiff was an employee of Cross-Defendant Icon Remodeling,
Inc. (“Icon”) at the time of the incident,  and 4711 Berryman entered into a contract with
Icon in reliance upon Icon’s representation that it was properly licensed and
insured.  However, these additional
allegations would only demonstrate that Icon owes indemnity to 4711 Berryman,
and, to the extent State Fund’s denial of coverage was wrongful, Icon may have
recourse against State Fund.  But it does
not establish that State Fund owed 4711 Berryman any duty.
 
Therefore, 4711 Berryman has not met its burden to demonstrate
there are additional facts that could be pleaded to correct the identified
deficiencies.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
For the reasons stated, the Court sustains State Fund’s Demurrer to
the First Amended Cross-Complaint without leave to amend.  
 
State Fund shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file the
notice with a proof of service forthwith.
