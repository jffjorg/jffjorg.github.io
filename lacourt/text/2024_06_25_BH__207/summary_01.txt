And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the First Amended Cross-Complaint filed by Cross-Defendant State Compensation Insurance Fund against Cross-Complainant 4711 Berryman, LLC. The Court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend, finding that the allegations in the cross-complaint do not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against State Fund. The Court concludes that State Fund did not owe a duty to 4711 Berryman, as there is no contractual or insurer-insured relationship alleged between the two parties. The Court also finds that the allegations are uncertain and do not demonstrate that State Fund's denial of coverage was wrongful. The Court notes that 4711 Berryman has not met its burden to demonstrate that there are additional facts that could be pleaded to correct the identified deficiencies. The ruling is subject to change after oral argument.
