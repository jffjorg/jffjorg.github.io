English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint to reassert the elder abuse cause of action and seek punitive, exemplary, and treble damages. The judge finds that the plaintiff's daughter, Megan Frilot, is not a proper successor in interest to the plaintiff because Frilot was adopted and the parent-child relationship was severed. The judge also concludes that the plaintiff's motion is substantively proper but denies it because of the lack of a proper successor in interest. The case is continued to September 25, 2024, for a status conference.
