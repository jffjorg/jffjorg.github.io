And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the issue of justiciability in a case between John Doe, the plaintiff, and Jane Smith, the defendant. The Judge finds that the case is not founded on an actual controversy between the parties and therefore lacks standing. Furthermore, the Judge determines that the controversy is not ripe because the facts have not sufficiently congealed to permit an intelligent and useful decision. The Judge cites the Supreme Court's decision in City of Santa Monica v. Stewart (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 43, 59, which holds that a controversy becomes ripe once it reaches, but has not passed, the point that the facts have sufficiently congealed to permit an intelligent and useful decision.
