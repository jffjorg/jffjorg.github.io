Hearing Date: November 22, 2024
Department 54, Judge Maurice A. Leiter
Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Discovery
Moving Party: Cross-Complainant Christopher Ball
Responding Party: Cross-Defendant Cross River Bank
 
T/R:      CROSS-COMPLAINANT'S MOTION TO COMPEL
FURTHER RESPONSES IS DENIED AS MOOT.
 
CROSS-COMPLAINANT TO NOTICE. 
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
The Court considers the moving papers,
opposition, and reply.
 
On receipt of a response to
interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response if the propounding party deems that an objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general. (CCP 2030.300(a)(3).) The
responding party has the burden of justifying the objections to the form
interrogatories (“FIs”) and special interrogatories (“SIs”).  (Coy v. Sup.Ct. (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210,
220-221.)
 
Cross-Complainant moves to compel
further responses to FIs, set one, from Cross-Defendant Cross River Bank. In
opposition, Cross-Defendant represents that supplemental responses were served
on October 24, 2024. In reply, Cross-Complainant asserts that the responses
remain deficient. 
 
As Cross-Defendant has served supplemental
responses, the motion is moot. The parties must meet and confer on the latest
responses before further response can be compelled.
 
The motion to compel further is DENIED
as MOOT.
