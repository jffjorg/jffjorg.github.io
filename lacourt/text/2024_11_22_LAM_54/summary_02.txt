And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to strike the Defendant's answer. The Plaintiff sought to strike the Defendant's answer because it is a suspended corporation, citing Timberline, Inc. v. Jaisinghani (1997). However, the Defendant presented evidence showing it was in good standing with the California Secretary of State, and the Plaintiff presented evidence showing several tax liens against the Defendant, but this did not show that the Defendant remains a suspended corporation. The Judge has granted the Plaintiff's request for judicial notice. If the parties wish to submit on the tentative ruling, they must email the courtroom by 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
