Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
Judge: Holly J. Fujie
 



 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Lompoc Unified School District (“Moving
Defendant”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
 
The Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply papers.
 
BACKGROUND
            This action, which
was initiated on June 13, 2023, arises out of alleged sexual abuse of a minor while
Plaintiff attended a school in Moving Defendant’s school district.  The currently operative first amended
complaint (the “FAC”) alleges: (1) sexual assault; and (2) negligence. 
 
On October 26, 2023, Moving Defendant filed a
demurrer (the “Demurrer”) on the grounds that the FAC fails to allege
sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action.  The Demurrer argues that Plaintiff’s claims
are time-barred and violate the California Constitution’s prohibition against
gifts of public funds.  
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
            The Requests for
Judicial Notice filed by Moving Defendant and Plaintiff are GRANTED as to the
existence of the documents and their legal effect, but not to the truth of the
matters stated therein.  (Dominguez v.
Bonta (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 389, 400.)
 
DISCUSSION
Meet and Confer
The meet and
confer requirement has been met.
 
Legal Standard
A demurrer tests
the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law.  (Durell
v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)  The court accepts as true all material
factual allegations and affords them a liberal construction, but it does not
consider conclusions of fact or law, opinions, speculation, or allegations
contrary to law or judicially noticed facts. 
(Shea Homes Limited Partnership v.
County of Alameda (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1246, 1254.)  With respect to a demurrer, the complaint
must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from the facts
pleaded.  (Rodas v. Spiegel (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 513, 517.)  While the allegations of a complaint must be
accepted as true for purposes of demurrer, the facts appearing in exhibits
attached to the complaint will also be accepted as true, and, if contrary to
the allegations in the pleading, will be given precedence.  (Moran v. Prime Healthcare
Management, Inc. (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th
1131, 1145-46.)  A demurrer will be
sustained without leave to amend if there exists no reasonable possibility that
the defect can be cured by amendment.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.)  
 
Childhood Sexual Abuse Statute
of Limitations
Under California Code of Civil
Procedure (“CCP”) section 340.1, as amended by Assembly Bill No. 218 (“AB
218”), in an action for recovery of damages suffered as a result of childhood
sexual assault, the time for commencement of the action shall be within 22
years of the date the plaintiff attains the age of majority or within five
years of the date the plaintiff discovers or reasonably should have discovered
that psychological injury or illness occurring after the age of majority was
caused by the sexual assault, whichever period expires later, for any of the
following actions: (1) an action against any person for committing an act of
childhood sexual assault; or (2) an action for liability against any person or
entity who owed a duty of care to the plaintiff, if a wrongful or negligent act
by that person or entity was a legal cause of the childhood sexual assault that
resulted in the injury to the plaintiff. 
(CCP § 340.1, subd. (a)(1)-(a)(2).)[1]
 
The version of
the statute that applied when Plaintiff initiated this action contains a
provision that states: “Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any claim
for damages described in paragraphs (1) through (3), inclusive, of subdivision
(a) that has not been litigated to finality and that would otherwise be barred
as of January 1, 2020, because the applicable statute of limitations, claim
presentation deadline, or any other time limit had expired, is revived, and
these claims may be commenced within three years of January 1, 2020.  A plaintiff shall have the later of the
three-year time period under this subdivision or the time period under
subdivision (a) as amended by the act that added this subdivision.”  (CCP § 340.1, subd. (q) [effective from
January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022].)
 
Under California
Rules of Court (“CRC”), Emergency Rule 9, the statutes of limitations and repose of civil causes of action that
exceed 180 days are tolled from April 6, 2020, until October 1, 2020.  (CRC, appen. I, emer. r. 9.)  
 
Moving Defendant argues that the FAC’s
claims are expired because Plaintiff did not file this action until June 13,
2023 and that Emergency Rule 9 does not supersede the statutory filing deadline
imposed by former CCP section 340.1, subdivision (q).  The Court is not persuaded by Moving
Defendant’s argument on this point and declines to hold that Emergency Rule 9
does not apply to CCP section 340.1.  The
Court adopts the reasoning set forth in a recent appellate court decision
finding that the tolling provision of Emergency Rule 9 is applicable to CCP
section 340.1, subdivision (q.)  (See Roe v. Doe (Cal. Ct. App., Dec. 20, 2023, No. F086315) 2023 WL 9184651, at *4.)
 
Gifts of
Public Funds
Article XVI, section 6 of the
California Constitution (the “Anti-Gift Provision”) provides, in relevant part:
“The Legislature shall have no power to give or to lend, or to authorize the
giving or lending, of the credit of the State, or of any county, city and
county, city, township or other political corporation or subdivision of the
State now existing, or that may be hereafter established, in aid of or to any
person, association, or corporation, whether municipal or otherwise, or to
pledge the credit thereof, in any manner whatever, for the payment of the
liabilities of any individual, association, municipal or other corporation
whatever; nor shall it have power to make any gift or authorize the making of
any gift, of any public money or thing of value to any individual, municipal or
other corporation whatever… .”  (Cal.
Const., art. XVI, § 6.)
 
It is generally held that in
determining whether an appropriation of public funds is to be considered a
gift, the primary question is whether the funds are to be used for a “public”
or “private” purpose; the benefit to the state from an expenditure for a public
purpose is in the nature of consideration and the funds expended are therefore
not a gift even though private persons are benefited therefrom.  (County of Alameda v. Carleson
(1971) 5 Cal.3d 730, 745-46.)  The
determination of what constitutes a public purpose is primarily a matter for
the Legislature to determine, and its discretion will not be disturbed by the
courts so long as that determination has a reasonable basis.  (Id.) 
An appropriation of money by the legislature for the relief of one who
has no legal claim therefor must be regarded as a gift, within the meaning of
that term as used in the section, and is none the less a gift that a sufficient
motive appears for its appropriation, if the motive does not rest upon a valid
consideration.  (Powell v. Phelan
(1903) 138 Cal. 271, 274-75.)  The
California Supreme Court has held that creating liability against the state for
any past acts of negligence on the part of its officers, agents or employees
would, in effect, be the making of a gift. 
(Heron v. Riley (1930) 209 Cal. 507, 517.)  
 
 
AB 218 amended the provision that
lists exceptions to the Government Claims Act, Government Code section 905, by
removing language in subdivision (m) that limited the exception to claims
arising out of conduct that occurred on or after January 2009 and adding
subdivision (p), which made this change retroactive.  (See Coats v. New Haven Unified School
District (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 415, 424; Gov. Code § 905, subds. (m),
(p).)  
 
Moving Defendant argues that the
portion of AB 218 that retroactively exempts childhood sexual abuse claims from
the Government Claims Act is unconstitutional with respect to public entities
and constitutes an impermissible gift of public funds.  Moving Defendant’s argument turns on the
distinction between the nature of the statutes of limitation for childhood
sexual abuse cases and the substantive requirements of the Government Claims
Act for stating a claim against a government entity.  (See State of California v. Superior Court
(2004) 32 Cal.4th 1234, 1240-41.)  
 
The Court does not agree with Moving Defendant’s argument that AB 218’s
amendment of the Government Claims Act to add an exemption for claims of the
type alleged herein constitutes a “gift of public money or thing of value”
within the meaning of the Anti-Gift Provision of the Constitution.  As the California Supreme Court held in Heron
v. Riley (1930) 209 Cal. 509, 517:
 
“We
are not strongly impressed with the contention of the respondent that the
application of funds to pay judgments obtained against the state constitutes a
gift of public money, within the prohibition of the Constitution.  The state cannot be subjected to suits
against itself express by its express consent; but it may surrender its
sovereignty in that particular.  The
judgments which are to be paid bear no semblance to gifts.  They must first be obtained in courts of
competent jurisdiction, to which the parties have submitted their claims in the
manner directed by law.  In other words,
they are judgments obtained after the requirements of due process of law have
been complied with.”
 
The Court finds that AB 218 did not create an obligation on the part
of a governmental agency to pay a claim made by Plaintiff.  In order for Plaintiff to recover money from Moving
Defendant, Plaintiff must first obtain a judgment in this case.  Plaintiff’s potential recovery of monetary
damages from Moving Defendant after obtaining a judgment would not constitute a
gift under the circumstances.  (See Heron
v. Riley (1930) 209 Cal. 509, 517.) 
The Court therefore OVERRULES the Demurrer in its entirety.  Moving Defendant is ordered to file a
responsive pleading within 20 days of the date of this order. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to
the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on
the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive
an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed
off calendar.
