Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the demurrer filed by the defendant, Lompoc Unified School District, and has determined that the complaint filed by the plaintiff, John LFS Doe, is sufficient. The judge has also considered the arguments made by the defendant that the claims are time-barred and that the amendment to the Government Claims Act by AB 218 is unconstitutional. The judge has concluded that the amendment to the Government Claims Act did not create an obligation on the part of a governmental agency to pay a claim made by the plaintiff, and therefore the claims are not barred by the statute of limitations. The judge has also concluded that the amendment is constitutional and does not constitute a gift of public funds. The judge has therefore overruled the demurrer in its entirety and has ordered the defendant to file a responsive pleading within 20 days of the date of this order.
