And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motions for final approval of the PAGA/class action settlement and attorney's fees. The parties have agreed to a settlement agreement that provides for a gross settlement amount of $640,000 to be allocated among 323 class members. The settlement agreement also provides for attorney's fees in an amount up to one-third of the total GSA and litigation expenses not to exceed $25,000.

The court finds that the terms of the settlement agreement are fair and reasonable, and that the settlement is a reasonable compromise given the magnitude and apparent merit of the claims being released, discounted by the risks and expenses of attempting to establish and collect on those claims by pursuing the litigation.

The court grants the Settlement Motion and the Fees Motion in their entirety, and awards attorney's fees in the amount of one-third of the GSA. The court also approves the incentive award of $10,000 to the class representatives, Jose Luis Velasquez and Marvin Glenn Holloway, for their participation in the litigation.
