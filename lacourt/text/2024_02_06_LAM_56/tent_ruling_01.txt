Jury Trial: April 15, 2024



 
MOVING
PARTY: Defendants City of Los Angeles, acting by and through its Department of
Water and Power (“LADWP”) and Kevin Rodriguez (“Rodriguez”) (collectively,
“Moving Defendants”)
 
RESPONDING
PARTY: Plaintiff 
 
The
Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply papers.
 
BACKGROUND
On
March 29, 2021, Plaintiff filed a complaint (the “Complaint”) alleging: (1)
unlawful harassment under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (“FEHA”); (2)
FEHA race discrimination; (3) FEHA disability/medical condition discrimination;
(4) FEHA age discrimination; and (5) unlawful retaliation in violation of FEHA.

 
In
relevant part, the Complaint alleges: Plaintiff, a 59-year-old African
American, began working for Moving Defendants in 2003.  (Complaint ¶ 1.)  
 
After
Plaintiff complained about being singled out for hazardous duty and denied
protective equipment in 2017, Rodriguez, who worked as Plaintiff’s supervisor,
engaged in behavior that negatively impacted Plaintiff’s employment.  (See Complaint ¶¶ 3, 5.)  After Plaintiff made his complaint in 2017,
Rodriguez issued Plaintiff an official reprimand and instructed his assistant
Richard Gonzalez (“Gonzalez”) to harass Plaintiff.  (Complaint ¶ 6.)[1]
 
At
some point in late June or early July of 2017, Plaintiff was approved for sick
leave through July 18, 2017 by his physician. 
(Complaint ¶ 6.)  Plaintiff’s
inquiries about how July 4, 2017 would be classified for payroll purposes were
ignored.  (See Complaint
¶ 6.)  Rodriguez prevented
Plaintiff’s absence from being properly classified by barring Gonzalez from
approving a Time Roll Correction Authority (“TRCA”) form to reclassify
Plaintiff’s time off work.  (See Complaint
¶¶ 6-7.)  
 
In
August 2017, Plaintiff was placed on extended medical leave due to a stomach
cancer diagnosis, and he did not return to work until March 25, 2019.  (Complaint ¶¶ 7-8.)  During Plaintiff’s medical leave, Rodriguez
and Gonzalez continued to refuse approving a TRCA form, which delayed
Plaintiff’s receipt of disability benefits and shorted his pay upon his 2019
return to work.  (See Complaint
¶ 9.)
  
Rodriguez
again refused to approve Plaintiff’s TRCA Form in 2019.  (See Complaint ¶¶ 10-11.)  In 2019, Plaintiff learned that his pay was
being docked $150 per paycheck due to the misclassification of his July 2017
leave and that he was being denied a longevity premium of 2.5 percent.  (Complaint ¶ 11.)  
 
When
Plaintiff resumed working, Rodriguez continued to belittle him and refused to
issue Plaintiff a truck with crane capabilities, which aggravated Plaintiff’s
work conditions.  (Complaint ¶ 13.)  Rodriguez finally assigned Plaintiff with a
truck with a crane on March 17, 2020, after Plaintiff complained to the offices
of the Equal Opportunities Commission. 
(Complaint ¶ 14.)  Around this time,
Rodriguez removed Plaintiff from LADWP’s call out list, which limited
Plaintiff’s ability to perform extra work that would entitle him to overtime
pay.  (See id.)  During the COVID-19 pandemic, Rodriguez also
targeted Plaintiff on the basis of his race by soliciting information about
Plaintiff’s medical history.  (See Complaint
¶ 15.)  
 
Plaintiff
filed an administrative complaint with the Department of Fair Employment and
Housing (“DFEH”) on March 29, 2020. 
(Complaint ¶ 17.)
 
On
November 7, 2023, Moving Defendants filed a motion for summary
judgment/adjudication to the claims alleged in the Complaint on the grounds
that Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case, LADWP had legitimate,
non-discriminatory justifications for its actions, and the first, second,
third, and fifth causes of action are based on time-barred conduct that
occurred before January 1, 2019.  
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL

            Moving Defendants’ Request for Judicial Notice is GRANTED
as to the truth of the documents and their legal effect, but not to the truth

DISCUSSION
The function of a motion for summary judgment or
adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot
show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of
summary dismissal without the need for trial.  (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  California Code of Civil Procedure
(“CCP”) section 437c, subdivision (c) requires the trial judge to grant summary
judgment if all the evidence submitted, and all inferences reasonably deducible
from the evidence and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that
there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 
(Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp.
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)
 
As to each claim as framed by the complaint, the
defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial burden of proof
by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to establish a defense.  (CCP § 437c, subd. (p)(2); Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.)  Courts
liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that
party.  (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
 
Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.  To establish a triable issue of material
fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive
evidence.  (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.) 
 
Summary
Judgment Standard in Employment Discrimination Claims
In analyzing an employee’s claim for unlawful
discrimination under FEHA, California courts have adopted the three-stage,
burden-shifting test the U.S. Supreme Court established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green (1973) 411 U.S. 792.  (Swanson
v. Morongo Unified School Dist. (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 954, 964.)  The McDonnell
Douglas test reflects the principle that direct evidence of intentional
discrimination is rare, and that such claims must usually be proved
circumstantially.  (Id.)  Thus, by successive steps of increasingly
narrow focus, the test allows discrimination to be inferred from facts that
create a reasonable likelihood of bias and are not satisfactorily explained.  (Id.)  
 
California courts have recognized that the McDonnell Douglas test was originally
developed for use at trial, not in summary judgment proceedings.  (Id. at 965.)  California summary judgment law places the
initial burden on a moving party defendant to either negate an element of the
plaintiff’s claim or establish a complete defense to the claim.  (Id.
at 965-66.)  The burdens and order of
proof therefore shift under the McDonnell
Douglas test when an employer defendant seeks summary judgment.  (Id. at 966.)  An employer defendant may meet its initial
burden on summary judgment and require the employee plaintiff to present
evidence establishing a triable issue of material fact, by presenting evidence
that either negates an element of the employee's prima facie case or
establishes a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for taking the adverse
employment action against the employee. 
(Id. at 966.)  To avoid summary judgment on the second of
these two grounds, an employee claiming discrimination must offer substantial
evidence that the employer's stated nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse
action was untrue or pretextual, or evidence the employer acted with a
discriminatory animus, or a combination of the two, such that a reasonable
trier of fact could conclude the employer engaged in intentional
discrimination.  (Id.)
 
Moving
Defendants’ Evidence
In support of the Motion, Moving Defendants present
evidence that Plaintiff was born in 1961 and was appointed to his current
position as a plumber on September 23, 2013. (See Separate Statement of
Undisputed Material Facts (“UMF”) 2-3.)  
 
In June 2017, at a safety meeting, Plaintiff stated
that he would contact CalOSHA about personal protective equipment for himself
and colleagues assigned to work with hazardous materials.  (UMF 28.) 
Plaintiff has never been suspended, received a Notice to Correct
Deficiencies, or received an oral warning that has been documented in his
personnel file.  (See UMF
31.)  On September 15, 2017 and October
10, 2017, Plaintiff filed complaints with CalOSHA and the Department of
Industrial Relations regarding safety conditions at work sites and alleging
that he was retaliated against for raising concerns about unsafe work
conditions.  (See UMF 32-33.)  
 
From July 3, 2017 through July 17, 2017, Plaintiff
was not at work pursuant to a doctor’s note. 
(See UMF 35.)  Plaintiff
intended to utilize LADWP’s “2 for 10” policy during his time off work, but his
supervisors did not respond to his inquiries about the impact the July 4th
holiday would have on his leave.  (See
UMF 36-41.)  After Plaintiff returned
to work on July 18, 2017, Plaintiff spoke to his supervisor Michael Nering
(“Nering”) and requested approval for a TRCA to convert one of his days off
from a sick day to a vacation day.  (See
UMF 44-45.)  From July through
September 2017, LADWP sent Plaintiff four letters to inform him that his
disability claim could not be processed until he provided certain
documentation.  (UMF 47.)  
 
Plaintiff began a second disability leave due to
stomach cancer on August 9, 2017, and he did not return to work until March 25,
2019.  (UMF 48.)  Plaintiff’s absences between August 9, 2017
through August 17, 2017 were incorrectly recorded as sick time.  (UMF 50.) 
On October 19, 2017, Plaintiff was notified that his disability claim
for July 17, 2017 was closed due to his failure to provide proper medical
certification, and that he did not qualify for disability benefits between
August 9, 2017 through August 22, 2017. 
(UMF 51.)  A TRCA was processed on
September 13, 2017 to convert Plaintiff’s absences between August 8, 2017 and
August 17,  2017 from sick to disability
leave; as result, Plaintiff was required to reimburse LADWP for salary
overpayment.  (See UMF 52.)  Pay deductions were authorized for the pay
periods spanning from March 31, 2019 through December 9, 2019.  (UMF 53.) 

 
 
When Plaintiff returned to work on light duty in
2019, Plaintiff was assigned a truck that did not have crane capabilities.  (UMF 81.) 
The tasks Plaintiff was assigned to perform did not require a
crane.  (Id.)  A younger employee was assigned a truck with
a crane.  (UMF 78.)  Plaintiff never asked for a newer truck, and
other coworkers likewise worked with trucks that lacked crane
capabilities.  (See UMF
79-80.)  
 
Beginning on March 25, 2020, Plaintiff has worked
remotely due to his immunocompromised status. 
(UMF 83.)  Plaintiff filed a
complaint with the DFEH on March 29, 2020. 
(UMF 90.)  LADWP’s Equal
Employment Opportunity Services has no record of internal complaints of
discrimination, harassment, or retaliation filed by Plaintiff.  (UMF 109.) 
 
Timeliness

As of 2020, the period to file an administrative
charge that is the prerequisite for a civil lawsuit for FEHA violations is
three years.  (A.B. 9, 2019 Cal Stats.
Ch. 709, Sec. 3; Pollock v. Tri-Modal Distribution Servs., Inc., (2021)
11 Cal.5th 918, 931.)  The three-year
limitations period does not apply to claims that lapsed under the previous
one-year limitations period.  (See A.B.9,
2019 Cal Stats. Ch. 709, Sec. 3.)  
 
A DFEH complaint is timely under the continuing violations
exception to the deadline for filing an administrative complaint if
discriminatory practices occurring outside the limitations period continued
into that period.  (Dominguez v.
Washington Mutual Bank (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 714, 720-21.)  Continuing violations, which toll the statute
of limitations, exist where the employer’s acts: (1) were similar; (2) occurred
with reasonable frequency; and (3) have not become permanent, such that it
would be clear to a reasonable employee that further efforts at informal
conciliation to obtain reasonable accommodation or end harassment, would be
futile.  (Richards v. CH2M Hill, Inc.
(2001) 26 Cal.4th 798, 823.)
 
First
Cause of Action: Harassment
Under
FEHA, it is unlawful for an employer to harass an employee because of their race,
age, or disability.  (Gov. Code § 12940,
subd. (j)(1).)  A harassment claim
requires the following elements: (1) the plaintiff belongs to a protected
group; (2) plaintiff was subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment
complained of was based on protected status; (4) the harassment complained of
was sufficiently pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create an
intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment; and (5) defendants are
liable for the harassment.  (Thompson
v. City of Monrovia (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 860, 876.)  In
determining what constitutes sufficiently pervasive harassment, courts have
held that acts of harassment cannot be occasionally, isolated, sporadic, or
trivial, rather the plaintiff must show a concerted pattern of harassment of a
repeated, routine or a generalized nature. 
(Hope v. California Youth
Authority (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 577, 588.) 
The plaintiff must prove that the defendant’s conduct would have
interfered with a reasonable employee’s work performance and would have
seriously affected the psychological well-being of a reasonable employee and
that the plaintiff was offended.  (Id.) 
To determine harassment, a court looks at factors such as: (1) the
frequency of the discriminatory conduct; (2) its severity; (3) whether it is
physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and (4)
whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee’s work performance.  (Harris
v. Forklift Systems, Inc. (1993) 510 U.S. 17, 23.)  
 
Harassment
focuses on situations in which the social environment of the workplace becomes
intolerable because the harassment (whether verbal, physical, or visual)
communicates an offensive message to the harassed employee.  (Roby v. McKesson (2009) 47 Cal.4th
686, 706.)  Moreover, harassing conduct
takes place outside the scope of necessary job performance, conduct presumably
engaged in for personal gratification, because of meanness or bigotry, or for
other personal motives.  (Serri v.
Santa Clara University (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 830, 869.)  
Harassment is
distinguishable from discrimination under FEHA. 
(Id.)  Discrimination
refers to bias in the exercise of official actions on behalf of the employer,
and harassment refers to bias that is expressed or communicated through
interpersonal relations in the workplace. 
(Id.)  Harassment claims
are based on a type of conduct that is avoidable and unnecessary to job
performance.  (Id.)  Making personnel decisions is an inherent and
unavoidable part of the supervisory function. 
(Id.)  Without making personnel
decisions, a supervisory employee simply cannot perform his or her job
duties.  (Id. at 860-70.)  
 
            The Complaint’s harassment claim is based on an
amalgamation of the allegations underpinning the discrimination and retaliation
claims spanning from 2017 through 2020. 
(See Complaint
¶ 19.)  
 
            As a preliminary matter, the Court
notes that the allegations both in the Complaint and the DFEH state that
Rodriguez’s harassment campaign was affecting Plaintiff physically and
psychologically before he took medical leave in July 2017.  (See
Complaint ¶ 8; RJN, Exhibit 1.)  Without deciding the issue of whether Plaintiff’s
pre-2019 allegations may be considered as part of a continuing violation, the
Court finds that there no triable issues of material fact regarding the
harassment claim.  The vast majority of
the evidence regarding Rodriguez’s alleged harassment relates to personnel decisions.  Plaintiff has not provided evidence to provide
a factual dispute over whether any of Moving Defendants’ actions vis a vis the conditions
of Plaintiff’s employment constitute severe and pervasive harassment based on
his membership in a protected class.  Plaintiff’s frustration about his disability
payroll classification, the personnel decisions that were made once he returned
from disability, and the current regulations governing his current remote work
performance are insufficient to raise a triable issue of material fact.  (See
Doe v. Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 721, 737-38.)[2]
 The
Court therefore GRANTS the Motion with respect to the first cause of action. 
 
Second Cause of Action:
Racial Discrimination in Violation of FEHA
To
establish a claim for discrimination in violation of FEHA, the plaintiff must
generally prove that: (1) he or she was a member of a protected class; (2) he
or she was qualified for the position he or she sought or was performing
competently in the position he or she held; (3) he or she suffered an adverse
employment action, such as termination, demotion, or denial of an available job;
and (4) some other circumstance suggesting discriminatory motive.  (Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc. (2000)
24 Cal.4th 317, 355.) 
 
 
 
Although an adverse employment action must materially affect the terms,
conditions, or privileges of employment to be actionable, the determination of
whether a particular action or course of conduct rises to the level of
actionable conduct should take into account the unique circumstances of the
affected employee as well as the workplace context of the claim.  (Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc. (2005)
36 Cal.4th 1028, 1052.)  Thus, in
determining whether there was an adverse employment action to show discrimination
or retaliation, courts look at the totality of circumstances and not just at
each isolated act.  (Id. at 1055.)  Adverse employment actions can include
demotions, reassignments, refusals to promote, unwarranted evaluations,
tolerating harassment by coworkers, reprimands and suspensions.  (Id.
at 1061.)  Minor or relatively trivial
adverse actions or conduct by employers or fellow employees that, from an
objective perspective, are reasonably likely to do no more than anger or upset
an employee cannot properly be viewed as materially affecting the terms, conditions,
or privileges of employment and are not actionable, but adverse treatment that
is reasonably likely to impair a reasonable employee's job performance or
prospects for advancement or promotion falls within the reach of the
antidiscrimination provisions of  FEHA.  (Id. at
1054-55.)
 
A legitimate nondiscriminatory justification for an adverse
employment action is one that is facially unrelated to prohibited bias and
which, if true, would preclude a finding of discrimination.  (Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc. (2000) 24
Cal.4th 317, 358.)  Once a defendant
employer articulates such a reason, the burden shifts to the plaintiff employee
to establish that the defendant intentionally discriminated against her.  (Cornell v. Berkeley Tennis Club
(2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 908, 926.)  The
plaintiff must offer substantial evidence that the employer’s stated
non-discriminatory reason for the adverse action was untrue or pretextual, or
evidence the employer acted with a discriminatory animus, or a combination of
the two, such that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude the employer
engaged in intentional discrimination.  (Hersant
v. Department of Social Services (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 997, 1005.)  A plaintiff’s suspicions of improper motives
primarily based on conjecture and speculation are insufficient to raise a
triable issue of fact on this issue.  (Kerr
v. Rose (1990) 216 Cal.App.3d 1551, 1564.)
 
The second cause of action is based on Moving Defendants’ failure
to properly remit Plaintiff’s disability payments and the denial of overtime
opportunities.  (See Complaint ¶¶ 29-30.)
 
Moving
Defendants have met their burden to show nondiscriminatory justifications for
the alleged adverse employment actions: (1) official internal policy regarding
reclassifying sick leave; and (2) the distance between Plaintiff’s residence compared
to his coworkers which affects his suitability for being selected to perform
emergency plumbing jobs.  (See UMF 54, 74-75.)  
 
Plaintiff presents speculative anecdotal evidence
of a white colleague who was allowed to reclassify his sick time by filling out
a TRCA form before he retired in 2018.  (See UMF 56.)  This
speculative evidence is insufficient to raise a question of fact about the
legitimacy of LADWP’s internal policy.  (See Hersant v. Department of Social
Services (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 997,
1009.)  Nor does this evidence raise a
factual dispute that Moving Defendants were motivated by racial bias.  Plaintiff’s evidence regarding overtime opportunities
similarly fails to raise factual issues. 

 
In addition, Plaintiff argues that he has suffered
adverse employment actions since he began telecommuting—by limiting his opportunities
to be promoted, for example.  (See Additional Material Fact “AMF”) 7-8.)  The evidence and arguments about conduct that
occurred after Plaintiff filed the DFEH complaint are outside the scope of the
pleadings and are therefore not relevant to the Motion.  (See
Vulk v. State Farm General Insurance Company (2021) 69 Cal.App.5th 243, 255.)
 
The
Court therefore GRANTS the Motion with respect to the second cause of action.
 
Third and Fourth Causes
of Action: Disability/Age Discrimination
            As with the racial discrimination claim, Plaintiff has
not provided evidence to raise a factual dispute about Moving Defendants’
proffered nondiscriminatory justifications for processing of Plaintiff’s
disability and sick leave, or for the accommodations that they made when Plaintiff
returned to work.  Plaintiff’s anecdotal
evidence about younger colleagues, without anything further, is insufficient to
indicate that LADWP’s nondiscriminatory justifications are pretext for discriminatory
animus.  As to the sufficiency of the
truck he was equipped with upon his return to work in 2019, the Court notes
that Plaintiff’s arguments seem to relate more to the sufficiency of his
accommodations.  Failure to provide
reasonable accommodations is a distinct claim from disability discrimination
that is not alleged in the Complaint.  (See
Lui v. City and County of San Francisco (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 962, 970.) 
 
The
Court therefore GRANTS the Motion with respect to the third and fourth causes
of action. 
 
Fifth
Cause of Action: Retaliation
FEHA
makes it unlawful for an employer to retaliate against an employee who has
opposed any discriminatory action or¿who has filed a complaint, testified, or
assisted in a FEHA proceeding.  (George
v. California Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd.¿(2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 1475,
1489.)  As a general rule, close temporal
proximity is sufficient to establish a prima facie¿causal¿connection¿between
protected activity and adverse employment action.  (Arteaga v. Brink's, Inc.¿(2008)
163¿Cal.App.4th¿327, 334-35.)  It is difficult
to resolve claims of retaliation on summary judgment, where the court draws all
reasonable inferences in favor of the party opposing such a motion.  (Nazir v. United Airlines, Inc.¿(2009)
178 Cal.App.4th 243, 286.)  
 
In
order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under FEHA, a plaintiff
must show that: (1) he or she engaged in a protected activity; (2) the employer
subjected the employee to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link
existed between the protected activity and¿the employer's action.  (Yanowitz¿v.¿L'Oreal¿USA, Inc.¿(2005)
36 Cal.4th 1028, 1042.)¿ Once an employee establishes a prima facie case,
the employer is required to offer a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for the
adverse employment action.  (Id.)  If the employer produces a legitimate reason
for the adverse employment action, the presumption of retaliation drops out of
the picture, and the burden shifts back to the employee to prove intentional
retaliation.  (Id.)
 
Plaintiff
has not presented evidence to raise a factual dispute over Moving Defendants’
knowledge of Plaintiff’s protected activity. 
Plaintiff presents evidence of a 2017 complaint he made regarding
workplace safety; however, Plaintiff’s whistleblower complaints do not include
facts that implicate the anti-discrimination provisions of FEHA.  (See UMF 109 and response.)  The Court therefore GRANTS the Motion with
respect to the fifth cause of action. 
 
As
summary adjudication is granted as to each of Plaintiff’s five causes of action,
the Court GRANTS Summary Judgment as to the entire action.  
            
 
            Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
In consideration
of the current COVID-19 pandemic situation, the Court strongly encourages
that appearances on all proceedings, including this one, be made by
LACourtConnect if the parties do not submit on the tentative.  If
you instead intend to make an appearance in person at Court on this matter, you
must send an email by 2 p.m. on the last Court day before the scheduled date of
the hearing to SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org stating your intention to appear in
person.  The Court will then inform you by close of business that day
of the time your hearing will be held. The time set for the hearing may be at
any time during that scheduled hearing day, or it may be necessary to schedule
the hearing for another date if the Court is unable to accommodate all personal
appearances set on that date.  This rule is necessary to ensure that
adequate precautions can be taken for proper social distancing.
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
