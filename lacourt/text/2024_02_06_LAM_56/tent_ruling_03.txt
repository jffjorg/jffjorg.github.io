MOVING
PARTY: Plaintiffs Jose Luis Velasquez (“Velasquez”) and Marvin Glenn Holloway (“Holloway”)
(collectively, “Plaintiffs”)
 
The
Court has considered the moving papers. 
No opposition papers were filed. 
Any opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at
least nine court days before the hearing pursuant to California Code of
Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision (b). 
 
BACKGROUND
            The currently operative first amended complaint (the “FAC”) alleges ten
causes of action arising out of an employment relationship, including a claim
arising under the Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”).  
 
 
            On September 6, 2023, the Court
granted Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary approval of PAGA and class action
settlement (the “PA Motion”).  On January
12, 2024, Plaintiffs filed: (1) a motion for final approval of PAGA and class
action settlement (the “Settlement Motion”); and (2) a motion for attorney’s
fees and costs (the “Fees Motion”). 
 
DISCUSSION
Approval
of class action settlements occurs in two steps.  First, the court preliminarily approves the settlement,
and the class members are notified as directed by the court.  (Cal. Rules of Court (“CRC”), r. 3.769(c),
(f); Cellphone Termination Fee Cases
(2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1118.) 
Second, the court conducts a final approval hearing to inquire into the
fairness of the proposed settlement.  (CRC,
r. 3.769(e); Cellphone Termination Fee
Cases, supra, 180 Cal.App.4th at 1118.)  
 
The
trial court has broad discretion to determine whether the settlement is
fair.  (Cellphone Termination Fee Cases, supra, 180 Cal.App.4th at
1117.)  In determining whether to approve
a class settlement, the court’s responsibility is to “prevent fraud, collusion
or unfairness to the class” through settlement and dismissal of the class
action because the rights of the class members, and even named plaintiffs, “may
not have been given due regard by the negotiating parties.”  (Consumer
Advocacy Group, Inc. v. Kintetsu Enterprises of America (2006) 141
Cal.App.4th 46, 60.)
 
 
 
Terms
of the Settlement
Plaintiffs
entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Defendant
Water Damage Rescue, Inc. (“Defendant”) after the parties participated in
private mediation.  (See Declaration
of Jean-Claude Lapuyade (“Lapuyade Decl.”) ¶¶ 3, 10, Exhibit 1.) The Settlement
Agreement provides for a gross settlement amount (the “GSA”) of $640,000 to be
allocated among 323 class members.  (Lapuyade
Decl. ¶¶ 10, 20.) 
 
 The Parties have agreed to a disbursement of
the GSA as follows: (1) attorney’s fees in an amount up to one third of the
total GSA and litigation expenses not to exceed $25,000; (2) an incentive award
to Plaintiffs in the amount of up to $10,000 each; (3) fees and expenses of
administration of the Settlement Agreement to the settlement administrator in
an amount not to exceed $10,000; (4) PAGA penalties in the amount of $30,000, with
25 percent to be part of the remaining net settlement amount (the “NSA”) that
will be distributed to PAGA class members and the other 75 percent paid to the California
Labor and Workforce Development Agency (“LWDA”).  (See Lapuyade Decl. ¶¶ 20, 46.)  The NSA is approximately $341,667 and will be
allocated to participating class members on a pro-rata basis according to the
number of weeks each class member worked during the relevant class period,
resulting in an average individual payment of $1,077.81.  (Lapuyade Decl. ¶ 11.)  
 
Class
Certification
Before the court may approve the settlement,
the settlement class must satisfy the normal prerequisites for class actions.  (Amchem.
Products, Inc. v. Windsor (1997) 521 U.S. 591, 625-27.)  The party advocating class treatment must
demonstrate the: (1) existence of an ascertainable and sufficiently numerous
class; (2) well-defined community of interest; and (3) substantial benefits
from certification that render proceeding as a class superior to the
alternatives.  (Brinker Restaurant Corp. v. Superior Court (2012) 53 Cal.4th 1004,
1021.)
 
            When it granted the PA Motion, the Court determined that
Plaintiff satisfied the prerequisite showing required for class
certification.  The Court incorporates
its analysis in the PA Motion of the class. 
On November 2, 2023, notice was sent to the 323 class members.  (Declaration of Madely Nava (“Nava Decl.”) ¶
3.)  As of the filing of the Settlement
Motion, a total of three notice packets were deemed undeliverable, and the
Settlement Administrator had not received any objections to the Settlement
Agreement or requests for exclusion. 
(Nava Decl. ¶¶ 10-13.)  The
Court finds that no circumstances have arisen that undermine the contours of
the class and thus certifies the class.  
 
Fairness
of Settlement
In
determining whether a settlement is fair, the Court considers all relevant
factors, including the strength of the plaintiffs’ case, the risk, expense,
complexity and likely duration of further litigation, the risk of maintaining
class action status through trial, the amount offered in settlement, the extent
of discovery completed and the stage of the proceedings, the experience and
views of counsel, the presence of a governmental participant, and the reaction
of the class members to the proposed settlement.  (Kullar
v. Foot Locker Retail, Inc. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 116, 128.)  The recovery should represent a reasonable
compromise, given the magnitude and apparent merit of the claims being
released, discounted by the risks and expenses of attempting to establish and
collect on those claims by pursuing the litigation.  (Id. at
129.)  Nevertheless, the strength of the
case on the merits for the plaintiffs is the most important factor, balanced
against the amount offered in settlement. 
(Id.
at 130.)
 
The
fact that a proposed settlement may only amount to a fraction of the potential
recovery does not, in and of itself, mean that the proposed settlement is
grossly inadequate and should be disapproved. 
(City of Detroit v. Grinnell
Corporation (2d Cir. 1974) 495 F.2d 448, 455.)  The test is not the maximum amount plaintiff
might have obtained at trial on the complaint but, rather, whether the
settlement is reasonable under all of the circumstances.  (Wershba
v. Apple Computer, Inc. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 224, 250.)
 
A
presumption of fairness exists where: (1) the settlement is reached through
arm’s-length bargaining; (2) investigation and discovery are sufficient to
allow counsel and the court to act intelligently; (3) counsel is experienced in
similar litigation; and (4) the percentage of objectors is small.  (Cellphone
Termination Fee Cases (2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1118.)
 
The
average settlement payment is estimated to be $1,077.81, with the highest
payment estimated as being $7,049.13 and the lowest payment estimated as being
$3.46.  (Nava Decl. ¶ 15.)  The average PAGA payment is estimated to be
$94.97.  (Nava Decl. ¶¶ 17.)  The Court incorporates its analysis of the
Settlement Agreement set forth in the PA Motion and finds that the terms of the
Settlement Agreement are fair.
 
 
 
PAGA
Settlement
Labor Code section 2699, subdivision (l)(2) provides
that the superior court shall review and approve any settlement of any civil
action filed pursuant to PAGA.  (Lab.
Code § 2699, subd. (l)(2).)  Section 2699,
subdivision (l)(2) requires submission of the proposed settlement to the Labor
Workforce and Development Agency (the “LWDA”) at the same time it is submitted
to the court.  (Id.)  Any settlement of any
civil action filed under PAGA must be “fair and adequate in view of the
purposes and policies of the statute.”  (Flores v. Starwood Hotels & Resorts
Worldwide, Inc. (C.D. Cal. 2017) 253 F.Supp.3d 1074, 1077.)  Seventy five percent of all PAGA penalties
must be paid to the LWDA and the remaining 25 percent must be paid to the
aggrieved employees.  (Lab. Code, § 2699,
subd. (i).)  
 
Based on the terms of the Settlement Agreement and
the allocation of the GSA to the LDWA described above, the Court finds that the
PAGA Settlement complies with Labor Code section 2699, subdivision (i).
 
Incentive
Award
The
Settlement Motion seeks approval of an incentive award of $10,000 to Plaintiffs
for acting as class representatives in this action.  The Court approves this amount based on
Plaintiffs’ participation in this litigation.  (See Declaration of Jose Luis Velasquez
(“Velasquez Decl.”); Declaration of Marvin Glenn Holloway (“Holloway Decl.).)
 
 
 
Attorney’s Fees and Costs
Under California
Rules of Court (“CRC”), rule 3.769, any agreement, express or implied, that has
been entered into with respect to the payment of attorney’s fees or the
submission of an application for the approval of attorney’s fees must be set
forth in full in any application for approval of the dismissal or settlement of
an action that has been certified as a class action.  (CRC, r. 3.769(b).)  Ultimately, the award of attorney’s fees is
made by the court at the fairness hearing, using the lodestar method with a
multiplier, if appropriate.  (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22
Cal.4th 1084, 1095-96.)  In common fund
cases, the court may utilize the percentage method, cross-checked by the
lodestar.  (Laffitte v. Robert Half Int’l, Inc. (2016) 1 Cal.5th 480,
503.)  Despite any agreement by the
parties to the contrary, the court has an independent right and responsibility
to review the attorney fees provision of the settlement agreement and award only
so much as it determined reasonable.  (Garabedian v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone
Company (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 123, 128.)
 
Plaintiffs seek approval of attorney’s fees in the
amount of up to $238,333.33, which represents $213,333.33 in attorney’s fees
and up to $25,000 in costs.[1]  Based
on the evidence set forth in the supporting declarations regarding the
qualifications of the attorneys who billed time in this matter, the
reasonableness of counsels’ hourly rates, the complexity of negotiating this
case, and the results obtained, the Court finds that an attorney’s fee award in
the amount of one-third of the GSA is warranted.  This amount is reasonable given the facts of
this case and is consistent with fee awards in class actions.[2]  The Court further finds that
the costs incurred were reasonable and necessary to carrying out the
representation in this matter. 
 
CONCLUSION
Based
on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the Settlement Motion and the Fees Motion in
their entirety.
