Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all five causes of action alleged by the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleged that he was subjected to harassment, racial discrimination, disability discrimination, age discrimination, and retaliation by his employer, the City of Los Angeles, Department of Water and Power (LADWP).

The court finds that the plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of fact on any of the claims. The defendants presented legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for their actions, and the plaintiff failed to provide evidence that these reasons were pretextual or motivated by discriminatory animus.

The court notes that the plaintiff's allegations regarding his disability and sick leave were not supported by evidence, and that his claims of harassment and retaliation were based on speculative and anecdotal evidence. The court also finds that the defendants' actions were not discriminatory, but rather were based on legitimate business reasons.

As a result, the court grants summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all five causes of action.
