And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling denying without prejudice the application of Sara E. Abston to appear as counsel pro hac vice to represent plaintiff Shannon Jaworski in this action. The Judge ruled that the application cannot be granted because there is no proof of service indicating that the State Bar of California was served with a copy of the application. The Judge noted that the applicant must first resolve the issue of service before proceeding with the application. The Judge encouraged the parties to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement and ordered the parties to give notice of the tentative ruling. The Judge also warned that if the parties neither submit nor appear at the hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.
