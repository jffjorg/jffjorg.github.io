And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a dispute between Plaintiff Briana Hudson and Defendant Mansfield and Associates, Inc. regarding a slip and fall on allegedly defective stairs. The Plaintiff seeks to strike Defendant's orthopedic expert witnesses, arguing that they are cumulative and redundant. The Defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the experts are not cumulative and that Plaintiff has not demonstrated prejudice.

The court has denied the Plaintiff's motion to strike the Defendant's orthopedic expert witnesses, finding that the Plaintiff has not provided any specific evidence of prejudice. The court has also granted the Defendant's motion for leave to augment its expert witness list designation, allowing the Defendant to formally distinguish and clarify the expected testimony of its experts.

The court has ordered the parties to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement, and has set a hearing date for oral argument.
