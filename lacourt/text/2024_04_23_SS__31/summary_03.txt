```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment against Rudy Alberto Rayo and Lydia Rodriguez. The reasons for the denial are: 1) the plaintiff did not file a default package for all defendants, including Jennifer Saavedra and Down and Out Bar (Doe 1); 2) the plaintiff has not dismissed all unnamed Doe defendants; and 3) the plaintiff appears to be seeking duplicative damages against Rayo and Rodriguez. The court has given the plaintiff an opportunity to correct these defects and submit a new default judgment package. Failure to do so may result in sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal.
