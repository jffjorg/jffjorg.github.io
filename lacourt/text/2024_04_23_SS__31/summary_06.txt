The defendant's attorney must also continue the hearing on the motion to compel further discovery responses using the online reservation system. The court is hoping that the hearing will not be necessary and is encouraging the parties to meet and confer to resolve the issues. The court also notes that parties should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.
