Abston (“Applicant”) seeks admission to appear as counsel pro hac vice to represent plaintiff Shannon Jaworski in this action.  Before proceeding on the merits of this application, Applicant must first resolve the issue of service. Cal. Rules of Court, rule 9.40(c)(1) provides, in relevant part, that a copy of the application and of the notice of hearing must be filed on all parties who have appeared in the cause and on the State Bar of California at its San Francisco Office.
