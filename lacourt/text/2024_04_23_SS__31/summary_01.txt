And here is a summary in English text:

Vista General Engineering Company, Inc. (Vista) has moved for summary judgment, arguing that Arturo Orozco Torres (Torres), its former employee, was not acting within the scope of his employment at the time of a motor vehicle accident on August 24, 2018. The accident occurred while Torres was on his way to his cousin's house to perform personal work unrelated to Vista. Vista has demonstrated that Torres was not compensated for travel time and that the truck he was driving was owned by him personally. Plaintiffs Adam Glick and Mary Glick, who were injured in the accident, argue that Torres was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident. However, the court has found that Vista has met its prima facie burden, and the Plaintiffs have not provided evidence of a triable issue of material fact. The court has granted Vista's motion for summary judgment.
