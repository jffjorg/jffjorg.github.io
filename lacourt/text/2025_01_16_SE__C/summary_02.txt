The judge is granting the unopposed motions of Richard J. Rosiak and The Law Offices of Richard J. Rosiak & Assoc. to withdraw as counsel of record for defendants Jose Chavez, Luz Chavez, and Jasmin Chavez. The court finds that counsel has met the procedural requirements, including proper notice to the clients, and that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship(s). The judge believes that Attorney Rosiak's continued representation would not serve the interests of justice and therefore grants the motions to withdraw.
