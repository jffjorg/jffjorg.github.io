Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants
ZHIDONG HAO and FANG WANG’s Demurrer to the Cross-Complaint is OVERRULED.

 
 
Opposing
Party to give notice. 
 
This
contractual fraud action was filed by Plaintiffs ZHIDONG HAO and FANG WANG
(collectively “Plaintiffs”) on August 17, 2023. On September 26, 2024, the
operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) was filed. 
 
On
January 12, 2024, the Subject Cross-Complaint was filed by Cross-Complainants
SG INVESTMENT LLC (“SGI”); and USIH, LLC (“USIH”) against Cross-Defendants
ZHIDONG HAO (“Hao”); FANG WANG (“Wang”) and Roes 10 through 10.  
 
Cross-Complainants
allege: “On or about May 17, 2023, Cross-Complainants and Cross-Defendants
executed a Settlement Agreement…. Cross-Defendants were paid the sum of
$200,000 pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. [¶] On August 17, 2023,
Cross-Defendants filed a Complaint… against Cross-Complainants in this
proceeding. In the first cause of action in the Complaint, Cross-Defendants
alleged a cause of action for Recission of the Settlement Agreement. In the
Complaint, Cross-Defendants served notice of recission of the Settlement
Agreement. Complaint ¶33. On or about October 9, 2023, Cross-Complainants,
through their attorneys,  notified
Cross-Complainants’ attorneys of their consent to the recission…. The
Settlement Agreement was thus rescinded, and under the law deemed extinguished
of that date. As a result, Cross-Defendants were required to return to
Cross-Complainants the $200,000 paid to Cross-Defendants. Despite
Cross-Complainants’ demands, Cross-Defendants have not returned any portion of
the $200,000 to Cross-Complainants. Cross-Complainants hereby seek a return of
the $200,000 from Cross-Defendants.” (XC ¶¶5-6.) 
 
The
Cross-Complaint asserts the following causes of action: 


(1)
Restitution; and 
(2)
Unjust Enrichment
 
Cross-Defendants
Hao and Wang generally demur to each cause of action. 
 
First
Cause of Action – Restitution 
 
Cross-Defendants
argue that Cross-Complainants have failed to adequately allege a claim for
“Rescission”. Cross-Complainants do not allege a claim for Rescission. The
first cause of action is Restitution. 
 
Under
the law of restitution, “an individual is required to make restitution if he or
she is unjustly enriched at the expense of another.” (Frist Nationwide Savings
v. Perry (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1657, 1662-1663.)
 
Cross-Complainants
have alleged sufficient facts to show that they may be entitled to restitution
from Cross-Defendants. (XC ¶¶5-6.) The demurrer to the first cause of action is
OVERRULED. 
 
Second
Cause of Action – Unjust Enrichment 
There
is a split of authority across the appellate courts regarding whether unjust
enrichment is a cause of action or a principle of law. Jogani v. Superior
Court (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 901, 911 and Melchior v. New Line Prods.,
Inc. (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 779, 794 hold that unjust enrichment is a
principle underlying various doctrines and remedies, including quasi-contract.
On the other hand, Hirsch v. Bank of America (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 708,
First Nationwide Savings v. Perry (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1657, and Lectrodryer
v. Seoul Bank (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 723 view it as a separate cause of
action.
Regardless
of whether unjust enrichment is a cause of action or not, Cross-Complainants
may still allege it as a theory supporting the remedy of restitution. A
complaint may state multiple legal theories upon which recovery might be
predicated for one claim for relief. (Newhall Land & Farming Co. v.
Superior Court (1993) 19 Cal. App. 4th 334, 351.)
Here,
Cross-Complainants allege that Cross-Defendants may be liable for restitution
to Cross-Complainants based on the purported rescission of the Settlement
Agreement. The demurrer to the second cause of action is OVERRULED.
