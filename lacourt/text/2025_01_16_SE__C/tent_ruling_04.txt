This action (22NWCV01769) is hereby consolidated with Ledezma v. Gutierrez (23NWCV02962); and Preciado v. County of Los Angeles (23NWCV03025), with the subject action acting as the lead case.All dates in case numbers 23NWCV02962 and 23NWCV03025 are hereby VACATED. The dates already set in the subject action remain set.Moving Party to give notice.No Opposition filed as of January 13, 2025.This personal injury action was filed by Plaintiff Derek Perez against Defendants Nicholas Joseph Gutierez and the County of Los Angeles on December 30, 2022. Plaintiff Carlos Ramirez filed his action against Defendants Nicholas Joseph Gutierrez and the County of Los Angeles on September 18, 2023. Plaintiffs Laruen Preciado; Dianna Fernandez; Jose Arias; and Asteria Arias filed their lawsuit against Defendant County of Los Angeles on September 21, 2023. On December 30, 2024, the Court ordered the cases related.The underlying incident giving rise to these actions involves an auto v. pedestrians accident. Plaintiffs allege that while the recruits of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department were participating in an organized training run, Defendant Nicholas Joseph Gutierrez, without warning, veered out of control and crashed into the runners.Defendant County of Los Angeles now moves to consolidate the cases of Derek Perez v. Nicholas Joseph Gutierrez (22NWCV01769); Carlos Ramirez Ledezma v. Nicholas Joseph Ramires (23NWCV02962); and Laren Preciado v. County of Los Angeles (23NWCV03025).Trial courts may consolidate actions involving common questions of law or fact. (CCP §1048.) Consolidating actions does not affect the rights of the parties. Consolidation’s purpose is to avoid unnecessary costs or delay, avoid procedural duplication, particularly in proof or issues common to both actions, and avoid inconsistent results by hearing and deciding common issues together. (Estate of Baker (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 471, 485.) Deciding a motion to consolidate rests in the trial court’s sounds discretion and will not be reversed except upon a clear abuse of discretion showing. (Feliner v. Steinbaum (1955) 132 Cal.App.2d 509, 511.) Two types of consolidation are available: “(a) When actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay. (b) The court, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trial will be conducive to expedition and economy, may order a sperate trial of any cause of action, including a cause of action asserted in a cross-complaint, or of any separate issue or of any number of causes of action or issues, preserving the right of trial by jury….” (CCP §1048.)Each case presents its own facts and circumstances, but trial courts generally consider the following factors: (1) the timeliness of the motion: whether granting consolidation would delay the trial of any of the cases involved; (2) complexity: whether joining the actions involved would make the trial too confusing or complex for a jury; and (3) prejudice: whether consolidation would adversely affect the rights of any party (State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1956) 47 Cal.2d.428, 430-431.) In deciding a motion consolidate, a court should weigh whether the common issues predominate over the individual issues and whether any risks of jury confusion or prejudice to the parties outweigh reducing time and expense that would result from the consolidation. (Todd-Stenberg v. Shield (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 946, 978.)In its Moving Papers, Defendants argue that consolidation for all purposes is proper where Case Numbers 22NWCV01769, 23NWCV02962, and 23NWCV03025 arise from the same motor vehicle accident and would result in the efficient utilization of judicial resources.The Motion is unopposed.It is undisputed that both cases involve the same operative facts. It is also undisputed that the related cases involve the same parties and will likely involve some or all of the same witnesses. In the interests of judicial efficiency, the Court finds that the actions involve common questions of law and fact, and should be consolidated. Therefore, the Motion to Consolidate is GRANTED.
