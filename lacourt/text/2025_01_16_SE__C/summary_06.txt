And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant MARK REYNOLDS, M.D. The demurrer was filed to certain causes of action in the complaint, including negligent infliction of emotional distress, loss of consortium, and medical negligence. The judge has sustained the demurrer to these causes of action with 30 days leave to amend. The judge found that the plaintiff's limited opposition to the demurrer was untimely and did not substantively oppose the demurrer. The judge also found that the plaintiff's allegations were conclusory and did not state a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress. The judge granted the defendant's demurrer to the fourth cause of action for loss of consortium, finding that the plaintiff's allegations did not restrict the claim to the lifetime of the injured spouse. The judge also granted the defendant's demurrer to the fifth cause of action for medical negligence, finding that the defendant did not owe a separate legal duty of care to the plaintiff's husband, children, and estate.
