And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's Fourth Amended Complaint is sustained without leave to amend. This means that the plaintiff will not be allowed to re-file their complaint to address the defendant's arguments. The defendant argued that the plaintiff cannot impose liability on them for events that occurred before they were formed, and the judge agreed. The judge also granted the defendant's request for judicial notice of the existence of certain documents, but not of any hearsay statements contained within those documents. The plaintiff had not opposed the demurrer, and the judge found that there were no arguments raised in opposition that would indicate that the plaintiff could cure the deficiency if leave to amend was granted. The case will proceed with the defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint.
