Defendant
B/W COUNTRY PARK (ABC), LLC’s Demurrer to Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amended Complaint
is SUSTAINED without leave to amend. 
 
Moving
Party to give notice.
 
No
Opposition filed as of January 13, 2025. Due by January 3, 2025. (CCP
§1005(b).) 
 
Defendant’s
Requests for Judicial Notice are GRANTED as to the existence of the documents,
but not as to any hearsay statements contained therein. 
 
This
action for wrongful death was filed by Plaintiff BLANCA PONCE, individually and
as Successor in Interest to the Estate of Maria Dolores Rodriguez (“Plaintiff”)
on February 18, 2020. 
 
On
June 28, 2023, the operative Fourth Amended Complaint (“4AC”) was filed. 
 
Defendant
B/W COUNTRY PARK (ABC), LLC was named as a Doe defendant on November 15, 2023,
and served on December 5, 2023. 
 
The
relevant facts, as alleged, are as follows: “This is a wrongful death action
arising out of the death of Maria Dolores Rodriguez (hereafter DOLORES, or Ms.
RODRIGUEZ, and/or Decedent) on November 2, 2019, due to the negligence, and
willful misconduct, committed upon the Decedent at the herein Defendant nursing
facility, BLYTHE/WINDSOR COUNTRY PARK HEALTHCARE CENTER, dba WINDSOR GARDENS
CONVALESCENT CENTER OF LONG BEACH (hereafter ‘WINDSOR GARDENS’).” (4AC ¶2.)  “Doe Defendants… were agents and servants…of
WINDSOR GARDENS at the time of the Subject Incident…” (4AC ¶11.) 
 
Plaintiff’s
4AC asserts the following causes of action: 
 
(1)
Wrongful
Death; 
(2)
Negligent
Hiring/Retention; and
(3)
Negligent
Failure to Warn, Train, or Educate; 
 
Defendant
B/W COUNTRY PARK (ABC), LLC (“Defendant”) generally demurs to each cause of
action because Plaintiff’s 4AC “seeks to impose liability on BW County Park for
events occurring prior to BW Country Park’s formation, apparently under the
theory that BW Country Park is either the ‘agent[] and servant[]” of Defendant
Blythe/Windsor BW Country Park Healthcare Center d/b/a Windsor Gardens
Convalescent Center of Long Beach (‘Windsor Gardens’)….” (Notice 2:13-17.) 
 
It
is undisputed that Defendant B/W Country Park (ABC), LLC did not exist at the
time of the Subject Incident. No facts are alleged to support
“successor-in-interest” liability. As of January 13, 2025, the Demurrer is
unopposed. Therefore, there are no arguments raised in Opposition to indicate
that Plaintiff would be able to cure the deficiency if leave to amend is
granted. 
 
The
demurrer is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
