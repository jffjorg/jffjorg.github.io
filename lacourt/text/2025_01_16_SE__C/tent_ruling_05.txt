Plaintiff’s unopposed Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment
against Defendant RODOLFO OLMEDO, aka Rodolfo G. Olmedo, aka Rudy Olmedo is GRANTED.  
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
No Opposition filed as of January 14, 2025. Due by January
3, 2025. (See CCP § 1006(b).)  
 
On December 26, 2023, Plaintiff and Defendant executed a
Stipulation for Entry of Judgment. 
 
Plaintiff contends that Defendant defaulted on his
obligations under the Stipulation and argues that Plaintiff is now entitled to
entry of Judgment in its favor in accordance with the terms of the Stipulation
for Entry of Judgment. (Keith Decl., ¶¶8 and 10.) 
 
“If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the
court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may
enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the
parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the
settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.” (emphasis
added.) (CCP. §664.6.) 
 
The Stipulation for Entry of Judgment indicates that
Defendant  agreed to make installment
payments according to a detailed time-table agreed upon by the parties. (See Keith
Decl., Ex. A.) 
 
Defendant is in default of the Stipulation for Entry of
Judgment. Therefore, Defendant is in undisputedly in breach of the written
settlement agreement entered into by the parties. The unopposed Motion is
GRANTED. The Dismissal entered on January 19, 2024 is VACATED. The Motion to
Enter Judgment is GRANTED. Judgment is entered against Defendant RODOLFO OLMEDO
in the total amount of $270,352.01. The Court will sign the Proposed Order
submitted by the Moving Party on March 22, 2024.
