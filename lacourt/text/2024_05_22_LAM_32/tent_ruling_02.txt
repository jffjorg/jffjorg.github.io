  Case No.:  23STCV24858
  Hearing Date:  May 22, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motions to compel further
  responses (CRS# 0806, 5371, 6092, 8885)




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On October 11, 2023, Plaintiff
Ronald Acito filed this action against Defendants Lance Soares Incorporated and
Lance Soares, alleging wage violations and retaliation. 
            On April 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant four motions to compel further responses from Defendant Lance
Soares Incorporated as to interrogatories, requests for admission, and requests
for production. Defendant has not filed an opposition. All four motions are
advanced and heard on this date (May 22, 2024). 
LEGAL STANDARD
Upon receiving responses to its discovery
requests, the propounding party may move for an order compelling further
responses if the responses are incomplete or evasive, or objections are without
merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(a), 2031.310(a),
2033.290(a).) 
MEET AND CONFER
A motion to compel further must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration demonstrating an attempt to
resolve the matter informally. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(b)(1),
2031.310(b), 2033.290(b).) The Court finds that Plaintiff has satisfied the meet
and confer requirement. (See Camilleri Decl.)
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff’s motions and separate
statements set forth good cause for the requested information. Defendant’s
responses interposed boilerplate objections which Defendant makes no attempt to
substantiate. Defendant also provided evasive or incomplete responses and
failed to produce documents in accordance with its statements of
compliance.  
            As no substantial justification has
been provided for Defendant’s failure to properly respond to discovery, monetary
sanctions are warranted. Given the simplicity of the motions and lack of
opposition, the reasonable time spent is 4 hours, and the reasonable rate is
$400 per hour. Plaintiff also incurred $240 in filing fees. Therefore,
sanctions are awarded in the amount of $1,840.
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motions to compel are
GRANTED. Defendant Lance Soares Incorporated shall provide further responses to
the subject discovery within 15 days of this order. The Court sanctions
Defendant in the amount of $1,840, to be paid within 30 days of this order.
