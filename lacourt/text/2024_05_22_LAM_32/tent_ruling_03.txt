     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendants’ motion for judgment on the
  pleadings 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On October 23, 2023, Plaintiffs
filed this action arising from alleged uninhabitable conditions. Plaintiffs are
two adults and their four minor children. Defendants are the alleged owners or
operators of the subject property. 
            On April 24, 2024, Defendants filed
the instant motion for judgment on the pleadings. Plaintiffs filed their
opposition on May 7, 2024. Defendants filed their reply on May 15, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
A motion for judgment on the pleadings may
be made on the same grounds as those supporting a general demurrer, i.e., that
the pleading fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a legally cognizable
claim or defense. (Stoops v. Abbassi (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 644, 650.) A
motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general
demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings
or by matters that can be judicially noticed. (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman
Corp. (1999) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999.) Judgment on the pleadings must be
denied where there are material factual issues that require evidentiary
resolution. (Schabarum v. Calif. Legislature (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205,
1216.)  
DISCUSSION
I.
Breach of the Warranty of Habitability 
            “[T]here is a warranty of
habitability implied in residential leases in California.” (Erlach v. Sierra
Asset Servicing, LLC (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1281, 1296.) “[A] tenant may
bring suit against the landlord for damages resulting from such breach.” (Id.
at p. 1297.) “The elements of such an affirmative claim are the existence of a
material defective condition affecting the premises' habitability, notice to
the landlord of the condition within a reasonable time after the tenant's
discovery of the condition, the landlord was given a reasonable time to correct
the deficiency, and resulting damages.” (Ibid.) “[A] tenant may
maintain a tort action against his landlord for damages suffered by way of
annoyance or discomfort or for injury to his personal property caused by the
landlord's failure to keep the premises in a habitable condition.” (Id.
at p. 1298.)
            Here, Plaintiffs allege that the
premises was subject to “a severe mold contamination, severe rodent and termite
infestation; lack of ventilation maintained in good working order; roof,
windows, foundation and/or structural damage to the walls and ceiling due to
deterioration, water intrusion, damage, and/or improper repairs.” (Compl. ¶
22.) Plaintiffs allege that they notified Defendants of the defective
conditions and that Defendants have intentionally ignored the issues. (Id.,
¶¶ 36-38.) Plaintiffs allege that they have incurred medical expenses, pain and
suffering, and damage to property. (Id., ¶ 45.) Plaintiffs also allege
that they have paid rent above the fair rental value of the property given the
defective conditions. (Ibid.) These facts fulfill the elements of a
claim for breach of the warranty of habitability.   
Defendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot
maintain claims for “tortious” breach of the warranty of habitability because
Plaintiffs have remained on the premises. Defendants contend that Plaintiffs
are limited to a contract claim arising from the implied covenant of
habitability within the lease. However, the cited authority does not stand for
this proposition. (See Andrews v. Mobile Aire Estates (2005) 125
Cal.App.4th 578, 590.) The court in Andrews did not distinguish between
tortious and contractual breach of the warranty of habitability, much less hold
that tenants who maintain possession of the premises cannot assert a tort
claim. As stated in Erlach, a tenant may maintain a tort claim for
uninhabitable conditions that cause injury to himself or his property. (Erlach,
supra, 226 Cal.App.4th at p. 1298.) Therefore, the first cause of action is
adequately pled. 
II.
Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment 
            “[E]very lease contains an implied
covenant of quiet enjoyment” which “insulates the tenant against any act or
omission on the part of the landlord, or anyone claiming under him, which
interferes with a tenant's right to use and enjoy the premises for the
purposes contemplated by the tenancy.” (Nativi v. Deutsche Bank National
Trust Co. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 261, 291.) Though the Supreme Court once
held that “the covenant of quiet possession in a lease is not breached until
there has been an actual or constructive eviction” (Standard Livestock Co.
v. Pentz (1928) 204 Cal. 618, 625), more recent authorities “recognize that
a tenant may sue for breach of the covenant while remaining in possession” (Nativi,
supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 292 [citing Guntert v. City of Stockton
(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 131, 141; Andrews, supra, 125 Cal.App.4th at pp.
590–591; Marchese v. Standard Realty & Dev. Co. (1977) 74 Cal.App.3d
142, 148]). “Breach can take many forms, including actual or constructive
eviction.” (Nativi, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 293.) 
            The same facts that support the
habitability claim also satisfy the definition of interfering with a tenant’s
quiet enjoyment of the premises. (See Compl. ¶¶ 22, 36-38, 45.) Based on the
above authority, the fact that Plaintiffs have remained on the premises does
not defeat the quiet enjoyment claim as a matter of law. Therefore, the third
cause of action is adequately pled.
III.
Statutory Habitability Claim
            Plaintiffs’ second cause of action
is for violation of Civil Code sections 1941 et seq. Defendants
acknowledge that a statutory habitability claim is actionable but argue that
the complaint here fails the heightened pleading standard for statutory claims.
(See Covenant Care, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 32 Cal.4th 771, 790.)
Defendants contend that Plaintiffs should have pled “which defective conditions
started when, what health conditions they were diagnosed with, when they
contacted Defendants for repairs, or what Defendants’ responses were.” (Mtn.
7:7-9.) Defendants cite no authority requiring this level of detail in pleading
a statutory habitability claim. 
The complaint specifies the alleged
defective conditions. (Compl. ¶ 22.) These conditions satisfy the definition of
“untenantable” under Civil Code section 1941.1(a). Plaintiffs allege that
Defendants responded to complaints by intentionally ignoring the issues. (Id.,
¶¶ 36-38.) For pleading purposes, these facts sufficiently establish a
violation of statutory habitability. 
IV.
Nuisance
            “Anything which is injurious to
health . . . or is indecent or offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to
the free use of property, so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of
life or property . . . is a nuisance.” (Civ. Code, § 3479.) “It is settled that
where conduct which violates a duty owed to another also interferes with that
party's free use and enjoyment of his property, nuisance liability arises.” (Cutujian
v. Benedict Hills Estates Assn. (1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1390.)  “[C]ourts have allowed plaintiffs to litigate
nuisance causes of action in cases involving housing conditions.” (El
Escorial Owners' Assn. v. DLC Plastering, Inc. (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 1337,
1348.) 
In Stoiber v.
Honeychuck (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903, the court held that “[a] nuisance may
be either a negligent or an intentional tort.” (Id. at p. 920.) “The
fact that the defendants' alleged misconduct consists of omission rather than
affirmative actions does not preclude nuisance liability.” (Ibid.) The
plaintiff in Stoiber managed to demonstrate intentional conduct by
alleging that the landlord had actual knowledge of uninhabitable conditions and
“acted with full knowledge of the consequences thereof and the damage being
caused to plaintiff, and their conduct was willful, oppressive and malicious.”
(Ibid.) 
The alleged
defects in this case are sufficiently offensive to the senses or obstructive to
use of the property so as to constitute a nuisance. (See Compl. ¶ 22.) As
discussed above, Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled the defective conditions and
that Defendants intentionally ignored the issues, thus allowing them to
continue. Defendants cite no authority for their position that they must have
“created” the conditions in order to be liable for nuisance. The law holds
otherwise. Omissions are actionable under nuisance as much as affirmative
conduct (Stoiber, supra, 101 Cal.App.3d at p. 920), and nuisance
liability attaches to those who create or maintain a nuisance (City
of Modesto Redevelopment Agency v. Superior Court (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th
28, 38).  
Defendants cite
no authority supporting their contention that Plaintiffs must allege a
diagnosed medical condition in order to maintain a nuisance claim. The
complaint adequately specifies the nature of Plaintiffs’ injuries. (See, e.g.,
Compl. ¶ 31.) Lastly, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have waived their right
to bring a nuisance claim by remaining on the premises. None of the cited
authority suggests that remaining on premises waives a nuisance claim, or even
discusses nuisance at all. (See Gould v. Corinthian
Colleges, Inc. (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 1176; Salton Community
Services Dist. v. Southard (1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 526.) Therefore, the
fourth and seventh causes of action are adequately pled. 
V. Negligence 
            The
elements of negligence are: (1) a duty to exercise ordinary care; (2) breach of
that duty; (3) causation; and (4) damages. (Ladd v. County of San Mateo
(1996) 12 Cal.4th 913, 917.) 
            Defendants
first argue that the negligence claim conflicts with Plaintiffs’ allegation
that Defendants intentionally refused to repair the property. However, “[a] plaintiff may
plead cumulative or inconsistent causes of action.” (Gherman v. Colburn (1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 544, 565.)
Plaintiff is entitled to plead multiple theories arising from the same facts. “A nuisance may be either a negligent or an
intentional tort.” (Stoiber, supra, 101 Cal.App.3d at p. 920.) 
            Defendants
then argue that the complaint fails to allege “Defendants’ actions or
inactions, when Plaintiffs first discovered the deficiencies with the subject
property, when they first notified Defendants of any issues, when Defendants
responded, and what the response was.” (Mtn. 10:12-14.) These are evidentiary
facts not required for pleading. As discussed above, the complaint adequately
identifies the defective conditions and alleges that Defendants ignored
Plaintiffs’ complaints and refused to repair the premises. These facts support
a reasonable inference that Defendants negligently maintained the premises and
harmed Plaintiffs as a result. 
VI. Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress
            To
state a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, a
plaintiff must establish: (1) outrageous conduct by the defendant; (2) the
defendant’s intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of
causing, emotional distress; (3) the plaintiff’s suffering severe or extreme
emotional distress; and (4) actual and proximate causation of the emotional
distress by the defendant’s outrageous conduct. (Vasquez v. Franklin
Management Real Estate Fund, Inc. (2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 819, 832.) “For
conduct to be outrageous, it must be so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that
usually tolerated by a civilized community.” (Faunce v. Cate (2013) 222
Cal.App.4th 166, 172.) “Severe
emotional distress [is] emotional distress of such substantial quantity or
enduring quality that no reasonable man in a civilized society should be
expected to endure it.” (Fletcher v. Western Life Insurance Co. (1970)
10 Cal.App.3d 376, 397.) A landlord’s willful failure to correct
defective conditions can constitute intentional infliction of emotional
distress. (Burnett v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1069.)
            Plaintiffs allege that as a result
of Defendants’ conduct, they have suffered “illness, physical injury, severe
mental stress, extreme emotional distress, anxiety, annoyance, discomfort,
fear, humiliation, anger, loss of appetite.” (Compl. ¶ 106.) These allegations
are too conclusory and vague to state a claim for severe emotional distress. (See Hughes v. Pair (2009) 46
Cal.4th 1035, 1051 [“discomfort, worry, anxiety, upset stomach, concern, and
agitation” do not satisfy the severity standard].) Therefore, the IIED claim fails as a matter of law.
VII. Unfair
Business Practices
            Business
and Professions Code section 17200 prohibits unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent
business acts or practices. Each of the three prongs is an independent basis
for relief. (Smith v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. (2001)
93 Cal.App.4th 700, 718.) Unlawful conduct is defined as any practice forbidden
by law. (Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 377,
383.) UCL actions alleging unlawful conduct “borrow” from other statutes or
common law causes of action outside Section 17200. (Klein v. Chevron
U.S.A., Inc. (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1342, 1383.) 
            The
causes of action discussed above sufficiently constitute “unlawful” conduct for
purposes of the UCL. Defendants argue that the UCL does not permit damages,
only restitution or injunctive relief. (See Korea
Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (2003) 29
Cal.4th 1134, 1144.) Plaintiffs explicitly seek “restitution and disgorgement
of all sums of money wrongfully
obtained by the Defendants during the entire term of
leasehold.” (Compl. 19:17-20.) Therefore, the complaint properly seeks
restitution, not damages. Whether Plaintiffs are ultimately entitled to
restitution, and to what extent, are factual matters unsuited for demurrer. 
Lastly,
Defendants cite Code of Civil Procedure 425.10 to argue that the complaint
fails to specify a precise amount. However, Section 425.10(b) states that “where
an action is brought to recover actual or punitive damages for personal injury
or wrongful death, the amount demanded shall not be stated.” The complaint here
is for actual and punitive damages for personal injury. Therefore, Plaintiffs
need not allege a precise amount. The UCL claim is adequately pled.  
VIII. Punitive
Damages
“In an action
for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract, where it is proven
by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of
oppression, fraud, or malice, the plaintiff, in addition to the actual damages,
may recover damages for the sake of example and by way of punishing the
defendant.” (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a).) “‘Malice’ means conduct which
is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable
conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious
disregard of the rights or safety of others.” (Id., subd. (c)(1).)
“‘Oppression’ means despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and
unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.” (Id.,
subd. (c)(2).) Fraud is “intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment
of a material fact known to the defendant with the intention on the part of the
defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights or
otherwise causing injury.” (Id., subd. (c)(3).) 
The conduct
discussed above is sufficiently malicious or oppressive for pleading purposes.
The allegations support a reasonable inference that Defendants were aware of
the defective conditions and their potential for harm, yet ignored the issue in
spite of Plaintiffs’ complaints. This sufficiently demonstrates willful
disregard for Plaintiffs’ rights and safety, or imposing undue hardship on
Plaintiffs. The complaint adequately pleads a basis for punitive damages.  
IX. Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress
            The
motion is moot as to the fifth cause of action for negligent infliction of
emotional distress because Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed that claim on May 8,
2024. 
 
 
CONCLUSION
            Defendants’
motion for judgment on the pleadings is GRANTED with leave to amend as to the
eighth cause of action and DENIED in all other respects.
