And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the plaintiff's motions to compel further responses from the defendant, Lance Soares Incorporated, in response to interrogatories, requests for admission, and requests for production. The defendant has failed to provide substantial justification for its lack of response to the discovery requests, and has instead provided boilerplate objections without supporting evidence. The court finds that the plaintiff has satisfied the meet and confer requirement and has made a good faith effort to resolve the issue informally. Therefore, the court grants the plaintiff's motions to compel and sanctions the defendant in the amount of $1,840 to be paid within 30 days. The defendant is ordered to provide further responses to the discovery requests within 15 days.
