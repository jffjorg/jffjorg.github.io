Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court issued a tentative ruling on May 22, 2024, regarding the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court found that the complaint adequately pleads a claim for breach of the warranty of habitability, statutory habitability, and nuisance. The court also found that the complaint adequately pleads a claim for punitive damages and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The court denied the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the fifth cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress.

The court's decision is based on the allegations in the complaint, which state that the defendants failed to maintain the subject property in a habitable condition, and that the defendants intentionally ignored the plaintiffs' complaints and refused to repair the property. The court found that the allegations are sufficient to state a claim for breach of the warranty of habitability, and that the defendants' arguments that the complaint fails to plead sufficient facts to support the claims are without merit.

The court also found that the complaint adequately pleads a claim for statutory habitability, and that the defendants' arguments that the complaint fails to plead sufficient facts to support the claim are without merit. The court further found that the complaint adequately pleads a claim for nuisance, and that the defendants' arguments that the complaint fails to plead sufficient facts to support the claim are without merit.

The court denied the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the fifth cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress, as the plaintiff had voluntarily dismissed that claim on May 8, 2024.
