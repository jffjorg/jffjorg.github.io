Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Defendant Diana McIntyre to the Eighth Cause of Action in the complaint filed by Plaintiff Gloria Balderrama. The Eighth Cause of Action alleges that McIntyre violated Labor Code section 1102.5, which prohibits retaliation against employees who engage in protected activities. The Judge has sustained the demurrer, finding that McIntyre is not liable for retaliation under Labor Code section 1102.5 because she was a supervisor and not an employer. The Judge relied on two California Supreme Court cases, Reno v. Baird and Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership, which held that individual non-employers are not liable for retaliation under similar statutes. The Judge also considered a federal district court case, Tillery v. Lollis, which reached a similar conclusion. The Judge has denied leave to amend the complaint because it would be futile.
