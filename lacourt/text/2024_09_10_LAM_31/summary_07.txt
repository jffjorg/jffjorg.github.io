And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion for entry of judgment for possession of a real property located at 448 S. Hill Street, Suite 1101-1102, Los Angeles, CA 90013. The judge notes that this portion of the motion is moot because a writ of possession was issued on June 26, 2024, and returned on July 12, 2024, indicating that the defendant had vacated the property. The judge also finds that the legal ground for the motion is unclear, as the notice of motion does not identify any law in support of the motion, and the plaintiff's citation of a case referencing Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 does not provide any authority for amending the judgment under that statutory provision.
