And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to a motion to compel arbitration. The judge notes that the arbitration agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) and that California law applies to the causes of action. The judge is not persuaded by the defendant's argument that the FAA requires a plausibility standard to be applied to the plaintiff's complaint, citing a California court's decision that federal and state pleading standards differ. The judge also rejects the defendant's reliance on a New York court's decision, Yost v. Everyrealm, Inc., which did not address the issue of pleading standards in the context of a motion to compel arbitration. The judge's tentative ruling suggests that the motion to compel arbitration will be denied.
