[1] Plaintiff sought entry of judgment
for possession of the real property located at 448 S. Hill Street, Suite
1101-1102,Los Angeles, CA 90013.  This portion
of the motion is moot.  As indicated by
Plaintiff, and as reflected in the court’s electronic case file, Plaintiff applied
for a writ of possession.  The writ was
issued on June 26, 2024, returned on July 12, 2024, and indicated that
Defendant had vacated the property.


[2] The court further notes that the
legal ground for its motion is similarly unclear.  The notice of motion does not identify any
law in support of its motion.  In a
footnote, Plaintiff cites one case which references Code of Civil Procedure
section 664.6.  To the extent Plaintiff
seeks to amend the judgment pursuant to Section 664.6, Plaintiff does not provide
any authority that a judgment may be amended under that statutory provision.
