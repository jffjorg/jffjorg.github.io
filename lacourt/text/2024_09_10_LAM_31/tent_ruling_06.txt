I.          BACKGROUND           
 
            This
case is a commercial unlawful detainer (“UD”) action by Plaintiff JMF Pershing
Square, LLC (“Plaintiff”) against Defendant Home Furniture International, LLC (“HFC”
or “Defendant”) for possession of residential real property located at 448 S.
Hill Street, Suite 1101-1112, in Los Angeles (the “Property”). 
 
On February 21, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a verified UD complaint against Defendant. 
 
On March 1, 2024, Defendant filed its
answer to Plaintiff’s UD complaint. 
 
On March 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
motion for summary judgment against Defendant pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure sections 1170.7 and 437c. 
 
            On
March 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed an amendment to the complaint naming Abraham
Amouyal (Amouyal) as Doe 1.
                        
On March 19, 2024, Plaintiff
dismissed Amouyal from this action without prejudice.
 
            On
March 20, 2024, the court granted the unopposed motion for summary judgment.
 
            On
March 28, 2024, the court entered judgment in Plaintiff’s favor as
follows:  
 
1.      For possession of the property
located at 448 S. Hill Street, Suite 1101-1112, Los Angeles, California 90013; 
2.      For forfeiture of the lease
agreement; 
3.      For back rent in the amount of
$65,831.27; 
4.      For daily damages from March
1,2024 through March 20,2024, totaling $11,533.20 (20 days at $576.66 per day
($17,300.00/30 days)); 
5.      Attorney's fees per motion; and 
6.      Costs per memorandum.
 
On June 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed
this Motion to Enter Judgment for Possession and Money Judgment Pursuant to
Stipulation.[1]
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD
 
            Code
of Civil Procedure section 187 states: “[w]hen jurisdiction is, by the
Constitution or this Code, or by any other statute, conferred on a Court or
judicial officer, all the means necessary to carry it into effect are also
given; and in the exercise of this jurisdiction, if the course of proceeding be
not specifically pointed out by this Code or the statute, any suitable process
or mode of proceeding may be adopted which may appear most conformable to the
spirit of this code.”  
 
“Section
187 contemplates amending a judgment by noticed motion. 
[Citations.]  The court is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing on
a motion to amend a judgment, but may rule on the motion based solely on
declarations and other written evidence. [Citation.]” (Highland Springs
Conference & Training Center v. City of Banning (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th
267, 280.)  “In the interests of justice, the greatest liberality is to be
encouraged in the allowance of amendments brought pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 187.” (Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Weinberg (2014)
227¿Cal.App.4th 1, 7 (cleaned up).) 
 III.           
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff moves to amend the
judgment entered in its favor and against Defendant and Amouyal to reflect the
following: 
1.     
Entry of a money judgment in favor of plaintiff and
against defendants, jointly and severally, in the amount of $111,967.61 ($129,882.61
for principal minus $20,000.00 in payments plus $2,025.00 for attorney's fees
and $60.00 for costs); 


2.     
 For forfeiture
of the lease agreement.
In support, Plaintiff provides a
stipulation executed by Plaintiff, HFC, and Amouyal, on April 1, 2024.  Under the stipulation, HFC and Amouyal agreed
“that a judgment may be rendered against them, jointly and severally, for money
judgment for $129,882.61, plus reasonably attorney’s fees and costs, less
payments made by defendants, if defendants fail to do any of the following: 
[¶]
B.        Pay
plaintiff $10,000.00 on or before April 15, 2024 . . . and 
C.        $10,000.00 per month on or before the 1st
day of each month commencing May 1, 2024 and continuing on or before the 1st
day of each month thereafter, until the $129,882.61 is paid in full.”
(Horowitz Decl., Ex. 1, Stipulation.) 
            HFC and
Amouyal failed to make the $10,000.00 payments due on April 15 or May 1.  HFC and Amouyal then requested to pay
$10,000.00 and agreed to vacate the Property on May 31,2024 and Plaintiff
agreed to postpone the April 15, 2024, payment to the end of the repayment
period if vacated by May 31, 2024. HFC and Amouyal made a payment of $10,000.00
on May 24, 2024, but did not vacate the Property on May 31, 2024, and did not
make the June 1, 2024, payment.  (See
Rosenbaum Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. 2.)
Based on the foregoing, the Court
finds that Plaintiff is entitled to an order amending the judgment in favor of Plaintiff
and against HFC.  However, it is not
clear whether the court may enter judgment against Amouyal because Amouyal is
not a party to this action, nor does Plaintiff move to amend the judgment to
add Amouyal under an alter ego theory.[2]  Perhaps a stipulation is sufficient, but
Plaintiff does not provide authority to support the proposition. Moreover, the
proof of service on the motion identifies counsel for HFC, not Amouyal or
counsel for Amouyal.     
 IV.           
CONCLUSION  
The Court
will hear from the parties.
