And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling in a commercial unlawful detainer action brought by JMF Pershing Square, LLC against Home Furniture International, LLC for possession of a residential property. On March 20, 2024, the court entered a judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for possession of the property, forfeiture of the lease agreement, back rent, daily damages, attorney's fees, and costs. The Plaintiff has now moved to amend the judgment to reflect a money judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants, jointly and severally, in the amount of $111,967.61.

The Plaintiff's motion is based on a stipulation executed by Plaintiff, HFC, and Amouyal on April 1, 2024, which provides that a judgment may be rendered against them, jointly and severally, for money judgment for $129,882.61, plus reasonably attorney's fees and costs, less payments made by Defendants. The stipulation also provides that HFC and Amouyal failed to make certain payments and agreed to vacate the property on May 31, 2024.

The court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to an order amending the judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against HFC. However, it is not clear whether the court may enter judgment against Amouyal because Amouyal is not a party to this action, and Plaintiff does not move to amend the judgment to add Amouyal under an alter ego theory.
