MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL



 
MOVING PARTY:               Frank
Revere, Revere & Wallace
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
            
            On August 1,
2024, Frank Revere, counsel for Plaintiff Nivo 1, LLC, filed this Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel. 
 
The Motion is unopposed. 
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD
 
            California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1)
notice of motion and motion to be directed to the client (made on the Notice of
Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a
declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under
Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of
Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3) service
of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who
have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel
(prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)).¿¿ 
 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.¿ (See Ramirez
v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)¿ 
 
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
            Frank Revere seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiff
for the following reason: “There has been and continue to exist failures to
communicate with counsel as well as Client's failure to accept counsel's
advice. These circumstances make it impossible for counsel to represent the
Client in this litigation.”  (Form MC-052.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿ 
Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s
request for withdrawal should be granted.¿ (People v. Prince (1968) 268
Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)¿¿¿ 
¿ 
Upon review, the court finds that the Motion complies with
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.¿ Given the lack of opposition, the
court further finds no prejudice will result from the granting of plaintiff’s
counsel’s request to withdraw.   
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            Accordingly,
the unopposed Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED and effective upon
the filing of the proof of service of this signed order upon Plaintiff.  
 
The court sets a Status Conference re: Counsel for Plaintiff
for October 11, 2024. 
 
Counsel to give notice.
