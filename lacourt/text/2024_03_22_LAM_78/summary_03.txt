And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted defendant Audrey Webb's motion for attorney fees and costs related to her special motion to strike, which was granted on October 31, 2023. The court has awarded a total of $12,114.55 in attorney fees and costs, which are payable within 15 days after the date of this order. The case is dismissed with prejudice as the decision on the Anti-Slapp Motion was dispositive. The court has found that the proposed fees appear reasonable, given the experience and qualifications of defendant's counsel, Roger Rosen, and the difficulty of the matter. The court has rejected plaintiff's argument that the fees are excessive, as plaintiff did not explain how the time billed was excessive.
