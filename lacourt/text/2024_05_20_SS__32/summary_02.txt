Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling denies the motion for terminating sanctions brought by Uber Technologies, Inc. against Prince Nortey. However, the court imposes $1,620 in monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel of record for failure to comply with discovery orders. The court finds that Plaintiff failed to provide a proper explanation for non-compliance and that less severe sanctions could have produced compliance.
