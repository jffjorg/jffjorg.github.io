Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, City of Burbank, filed a renewed motion to set a reasonable rate for the plaintiff's experts' witness fees. The motion was filed after the denial of the original motion on August 9, 2023. The court found that the renewed motion was based on new facts and circumstances that were not previously considered.

The court reviewed the deposition testimony of the experts and found that they did not contradict the declarations in a way that would justify setting a different rate. The experts testified that they had demanded and received payment for their services, but the number of times they had demanded the rate was not accurate.

The court denied the renewed motion and declined to award sanctions to either party. The court also declined to award monetary sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030. The court's decision is based on the Code of Civil Procedure and the court's discretion to consider the facts and circumstances of the case.

The court's ruling is tentative and may be changed or modified at the hearing on May 20, 2024.
