RULING
 



DEPT:

HEARING DATE:


May
  20, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


21STCV04645




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  for Terminating Sanctions   




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc. 




OPPOSING PARTY:


Plaintiff
  Prince Nortey



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Defendant
Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Defendant”) moves for terminating
sanctions against Plaintiff Prince
Nortey (“Plaintiff”) for failure to comply with the Court’s February 5, 2024 discovery
order and for failure to respond to other discovery served November 6, 2023,
and January 4, 2024. Defendant also seeks $1,620 in monetary sanctions. On
April 18, 2024, co-defendant Sung Kwan Choi filed a notice of joinder to this
motion. 
 
Plaintiff opposes and Defendant replies. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“To
the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method
or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected
party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may
impose…sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the
discovery process.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 2023.030.) The court may impose a
terminating sanction for misuse of the discovery process by any of the
following: “(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings
of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process; (2) An order
staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed; (3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that
party; (4) An order rendering a judgment by default against that party.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(d).)  Failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery, or
disobeying
a court order to provide discovery, constitutes a
misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d), (g).)

 
“The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse
‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the
party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the
propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the
discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 377, 390,
quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 1225, 1246.)   
 
“Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be
made lightly.  But where a violation is
willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’” (Los Defensores,
supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390 [citation omitted].)    
 
“Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating
sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders.”
(Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 citing Lang, supra, 77
Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244-1246 [discussing cases]; see, e.g., Collisson &
Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 [terminating
sanctions imposed (by striking the defendant’s Answer and subsequently granting
default judgment) after defendants failed to comply with one court order to
produce discovery]; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 481, 491, disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen (1997)
16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4 [terminating sanctions imposed against the plaintiff
for failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating various
discovery statutes].)  
 
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300(c), “[i]f a party then fails to obey the
order compelling a response [to requests for production], the court may make
those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).”
 
DISCUSSION
 
On
August 3, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with Request for Production of
Documents, Set One. On February 5, 2024, after Plaintiff failed to respond, the
Court granted Defendant’s unopposed motion to compel said discovery. Plaintiff
was ordered to provide verified responses, without objection, within 15 days.
Monetary sanctions were also imposed against Plaintiff and his counsel of
record, for $360. (Min. Order, 2/5/24.) On February 7, 2024, Defendant
electronically served notice of the order on Plaintiff’s counsel. Upon filing
the instant motion, Defendant contends Plaintiff has not complied with the
order. 
 
On
November 6, 2023, Defendant served Request for Production, Set Two on
Plaintiff. (Sharma Decl. ¶ 12, Exh. 4.) No responses have been served. On
December 12, 2023, Defendant served Request for Production, Set Three. (Id.
¶ 13, Exh. 5.) No responses have been served.
 
In
opposition, Plaintiff asserts he sent verified responses, without objections to
the discovery on April 22, 2024. (Panah Decl. ¶¶ 2–3, Exh. 1.) The opposition asserts
the discovery was inadvertently overlooked due to staff turnover. (Opp., 2.)
However, this assertion is not contained in a declaration. Nevertheless, it
appears Plaintiff has provided verified responses to Request for Production,
Set One. 
 
In
reply, Defendant does not dispute that the order has been complied with but
contends that Plaintiff has not responded to the November 6, 2023 and January
4, 2024 discovery. 
 
Defendant
argues Plaintiff is seeking double damages because he has a second lawsuit involving
a separate car accident on October 19, 2018. The car accident in this case took
place on February 14, 2019. Defendant appears to contend that terminating
sanctions are warranted because Plaintiff has disclosed medical treatment for
both of these accidents in discovery for this case. (Motion, 5.) However, since
this motion is brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
Defendant fails to specify a provision therein that provides the relief sought.

 
While
Defendant argues that the other discovery requests warrant terminating
sanctions, the Court notes that Defendant has not sought a motion to compel and
finds that less severe sanctions could produce compliance. Additionally, it
appears that Plaintiff is continuing to litigate this case, since Defendant
asserts that it took Plaintiff’s deposition on December 12, 2023. (Motion, 4.)
In light of this information, Defendant has not shown that less severe
sanctions could produce compliance. However, the Court finds that Plaintiff did
not provide a proper explanation, supported by a declaration, for why the
February 5, 2024 order was not followed. Therefore, the Court imposes $1,620 in
monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and his attorney of record. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2031.300(c).)
 
CONCLUSION
 
Therefore,
Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions is DENIED. 
 
The
Court orders Plaintiff and his counsel of record, jointly and severally, to pay
$1,620 in monetary sanctions to counsel for Defendant within 30 days of this
order. 
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
