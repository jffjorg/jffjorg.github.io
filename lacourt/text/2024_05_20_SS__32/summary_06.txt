And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to continue the trial to November 13, 2024. The judge finds that there is good cause to continue the trial due to the delay in discovery and the need for additional time to complete discovery. The judge also denies the defendants' request for sanctions, as the notice of motion did not specify the grounds for the request. The final status conference is continued to October 30, 2024.
