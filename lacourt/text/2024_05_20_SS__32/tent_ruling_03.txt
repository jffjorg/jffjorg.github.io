HEARING DATE:


May
  20, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


21STCV08556




MOTIONS:  


Renewed
  Motion for Order Setting a Reasonable Rate for Plaintiff’s Experts’ Witness
  Fees




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant City of Burbank   




OPPOSING PARTY:


Plaintiff Juana Gladys Cruz Acosta  



 
BACKGROUND
 
On March 4,
2021, Plaintiff Juana Gladys Cruz
Acosta (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against City of Burbank, Nancy L. Thomas, and Does 1 to 50
after allegedly tripping on a raised portion of sidewalk. 
 
On August
9, 2023, the Court denied Defendant City of Burbank’s
(“Defendant”) motion for an order setting a reasonable rate for Plaintiff’s
expert witness fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.470. The Court
found that the declarations from Plaintiff’s experts showed that their rates
were reasonable. (Min. Order, 8/9/23.) 
 
On April 4, 2024, Defendant
filed the instant motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008(b), arguing
that newly discovered facts show that the declarations in support of the August
9, 2023 motion did not accurately reflect the number of times the experts had
received the fees they requested. Plaintiff opposes and Defendant replies.  
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 provides, in pertinent
part:   
 
“(a) When an application for an order has been made to a
judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted
conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days
after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based
upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make an application to the
same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify,
amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.  
 
(b) A party who originally made an application for an order
which was refused in whole or in part, or granted conditionally or on terms,
may make a subsequent application for the same order upon new or different
facts, circumstances, or law, in which case it shall be shown by affidavit what
application was made before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions
were made, and what new or different facts circumstances, or law are claimed to
be shown. For a failure to comply with this subdivision, any order made on a
subsequent application may be revoked or set aside on an ex parte
motion.   
… 
(e)¿This section specifies the court’s jurisdiction with
regard to applications for reconsideration of its orders and renewals of
previous motions, and applies to all applications to reconsider any order of a
judge or court, or for the renewal of a previous motion, whether the order
deciding the previous matter or motion is interim or final. No application to
reconsider any order or for the renewal of a previous motion may be considered
by any judge or court unless made according to this section.”  
(Code Civ. Proc. section 1008, subds. (a),
(b), (e).)   
 
A motion for
reconsideration under Section 1008 requires that the moving party present new
or different facts that were not previously considered by the Court. (New
York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212-13.)
However, the burden under Section 1008 “is comparable to that of a party
seeking a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence: the information
must be such that the moving party could not, with reasonable diligence, have
discovered or produced it at the trial.” (Id.; Even Zohar
Construction & Remodeling, Inc. v. Bellaire Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61
Cal.4th 830, 833 [finding that Section 1008 imposes the special requirement of having
to not only show new or different facts, circumstances, or law, but also to
“show diligence with a satisfactory explanation for not presenting the new or
different information earlier…”].)¿¿A disagreement with a ruling is not a new
fact that will support the granting of a motion for reconsideration. (Gilberd
v. AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.)  
 
If the above
statutory requirements are granted, reconsideration should be granted. However,
a court is not required to change its decision upon reconsideration. (Corns
v. Miller (1986) 181 CA3d 195, 202, 226 CR 247, 251.) Although parties may
move for reconsideration only as authorized by Code of Civil Procedure section
1008, the statute “do[es] not limit the court's ability, on its own motion, to
reconsider its prior interim orders so it may correct its own errors.” (Le
Francois v. Goel¿(2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1107.)  
 
A motion to renew, under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1008(b), based on new facts, does not have a time limitation.
(Graham v. Hansen (1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 965, 970–71 [“It is apparent to
us that the 10-day limitations period for motions for reconsideration based on ‘different’
facts (§ 1008, subd. (a)) describes a remedy wholly discrete from the motion
for renewal based on ‘new’ facts long provided by statute and presently found
in the recently enacted section 1008, subdivision (b).”].) “Whether the ‘new'
facts alleged on a motion for renewal are sufficient to satisfy the
requirements of section 1008, subdivision (b), is a question confided to the
sound discretion of the trial court” which will not be disturbed “absent an
obvious showing of abuse.” (Id. at 971.)
            
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant’s original motion sought
to set the reasonable rate for the following experts: Kapil Moza,
M.D., Neil Ghodadra, M.D., Jonathan Frank, M.D., and Andrew S. Morris, D.C. However,
in the instant renewed motion, Defendant only asks that the Court set the
reasonable fees of Dr. Moza, Dr. Ghodadra, and Dr. Morris.[1]  In the original motion, the Court examined the
declarations of each expert and observed in relevant part the following:
 
“As to
Dr. Moza, his declaration indicates that he has demanded the $2,000 more than
700 times outside the present litigation and to the best of his memory, he has
received that fee. (Moza Decl. ¶ 7.) . . . Dr. Ghodadra’s declaration
states that he is a board-certified orthopedic surgeon, and similarly states
that he has demanded the fee more than 700 times outside the present litigation
and to the best of his memory, has received that fee.  (Ghodadra Decl. ¶
8-9.) . . . Dr. Morris’s declaration similarly states that he has demanded the
fee more than 700 times outside the present litigation, and to the best of his
memory, has received the fee each time.  (Morris Decl. ¶ 9-10.)”
(Min. Order, 8/9/23.)
 
Defendant argues the following facts contradict the
declarations. 
 
On December 5, 2023, Defendant deposed Dr.
Andrew Morris who testified he did not recall signing a declaration regarding
his fees in this matter, did not know how many cases had requested the same
fees in this case, and admitted that his fees were reduced once. (Aguado Decl.
¶ 13, Exh. 10, Morris Depo. 9:19–11:17.)
 
On December 15, 2023, Defendant deposed
Dr. Ghodadra who testified that he received the fees requested in this case 100
to 200 times, and not 700 times as represented in his declaration. (Id.
¶ 15, Exh. 11.) 
 
On February 21, 2024, Defendant deposed
Dr. Moza who testified that he received the fees requested in this case 50
times, and not 700 times as represented in his declaration. (Id. ¶ 17,
Exh. 13.) 
 
Upon reviewing the deposition transcripts
provided, the Court finds that they state new facts and will consider the
renewed motion to set a reasonable rate for Plaintiff’s expert fees. 
 
Motion to Set Expert Fees
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.470, subdivision (a)
provides that, “[i]f a party desiring to take the deposition of an expert
witness . . . deems that the hourly or daily fee of that expert for providing
deposition testimony is unreasonable, that party may move for an order setting
the compensation of that expert.  Notice of this motion shall also be
given to the expert.”  The motion must be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under section 2016.040.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.470, subd.
(b).)  
 
“In addition to any other facts or evidence, the expert or
the party designating the expert shall provide, and the court’s determination
as to the reasonableness of the fee shall be based on, proof of the ordinary
and customary fee actually charged and received by that expert for similar
services provided outside the subject litigation.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §
2034.470, subd. (c).)  “[T]he expert or the party designating the expert
shall also provide, and the court’s determination as to the reasonableness of the
fee shall also be based on, both of the following:  [¶]  (1) The
total number of times the presently demanded fee has ever been charged and
received by that expert.  [¶]  (2) The frequency and regularity with
which the presently demanded fee has been charged and received by that expert
within the two-year period preceding the hearing on the motion.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2034.470, subd. (d).)  
 
“The court may also consider the ordinary and customary
fees charged by similar experts for similar services within the relevant
community and any other factors the court deems necessary or appropriate to
make its determination.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.470, subd. (e).) 
 
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to set the expert witness fee, unless
it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2034.470(g).)
 
Analysis
 
Here, the deposition testimony does not contradict the declarations
in a way to justify that the fees are unreasonable. Dr. Morris testified that
he has charged $1,000 per hour since 2014 for every case. (Aguado Decl. ¶
13, Exh. 10, Morris Depo. 10:11–20.) His fee was reduced one time, but Dr.
Morris could not estimate when that occurred, stating, “it was ages ago.”
(Morris Depo. 10:19–22.) As for not recalling that he signed the declaration
for the original motion, Dr. Morris testified: “Oh, I don't know,
did it? I might have signed a declaration; I am in a lot of matters, I do a lot
of things, sometimes I forget.” (Id., 10:1–3.)
 
Dr. Ghodadra
testified that he had demanded a $2,000 hourly rate for more than 700 times
outside this lawsuit. (Aguado Decl. ¶ 15, Exh. 11, Ghodadra Depo. 18:18–23.)
But when pressed, he admitted that he actually received the fee in the past 100
to 200 depositions. (Ghodadra Depo. 18:24–19:20.) 
 
Dr. Moza
testified that he had been deposed more than 30 times. (Aguado Decl. ¶ 17, Exh.
13, Moza Depo. 5:11–13.) His current fee schedule has been in effect for three
years. (Moza Depo. 15:15–24.) Dr. Moza testified that he may have seen his
signed declaration to oppose the August 9, 2023 motion. (Id., 16:7–22.)
He generally testified that he did not recall writing the statements in the declaration.
(See id., 18:20–19:12.) However, Dr. Moza stated that he had been
retained as a treating expert on around 50 cases but could not provide a more
specific number. (Id., 20:17–21:11.) When asked why his declaration
claimed he had received a $2,000 hourly rate 700 times, Dr. Moza responded: “That
could be a typo. Maybe it means 70. I'm not sure. There's also a typo about the
specialty where it says neurologist. I'm a neurosurgeon. I didn't do a
residency in neurology, so possibly a typo.” (Id., 21:12–17.) Dr. Moza
later testified: “I don't know if that means there's 700 cases or we actually
told people 700 times that's what my fee is. That's what I read that as. I've
demanded in 700 cases just tells people that, hey, if you want me to do it,
this is what we charge. Maybe that's why there's a discrepancy. I don't see
anywhere there saying it's 700 cases I was deposed in. It says I've demanded it
that many times. For all I know I could have demanded it more than that.” (Id.,
23:9–18.) 
 
Here, the declarations in support stated
that the fee was demanded more than 700 times outside the present case. However,
even when considering the deposition testimony, the experts do not contradict that
they have collected payment for their rates, only the number of times they have
demanded the rate. The Court agrees that 700 is different than 50 or 100, as
Defendant argues. However, the lower values represent when the rate was paid,
and still support that the fees are ordinarily charged and received. Therefore,
the renewed motion is denied. 
 
Both parties seek monetary sanctions
against each other. However, the Court finds that Defendant acted with
substantial justification and declines to award sanctions. The Court also
declines Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.030. (See City of Los Angeles v.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504 [holding a court
may not award monetary sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure sections
2023.010 and 2023.030 standing alone or read together without regard to any
other provision of the Discovery Act].) 
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court DENIES Defendant’s Renewed Motion for an
Order Setting a Reasonable Rate for Plaintiff’s Experts’ Witness Fees.
 
Defendant shall provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
