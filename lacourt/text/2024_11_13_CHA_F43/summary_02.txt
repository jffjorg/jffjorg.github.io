And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's request for punitive damages. The plaintiff, Christopher Anderson, alleges that he was attacked by a dog on the defendant's premises and that the defendant acted willfully and maliciously by allowing the dog to remain on the premises despite its dangerous and aggressive tendencies. However, the judge has found that the plaintiff's allegations do not rise above the level of ordinary negligence to malicious conduct and that the plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to demonstrate that the defendant acted with malice. The judge has given the plaintiff 30 days to amend their complaint and has stricken the request for punitive damages from the complaint.
