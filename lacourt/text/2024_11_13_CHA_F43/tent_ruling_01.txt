the requirements of Cal. Rules of Court Rule 9.40.  
 
Rule 9.40

residence and office address; (2) the courts to which the applicant has been
admitted to practice and the dates of admission; (3) that the applicant is a
licensee in good standing in those courts; (4) that the applicant is not
currently suspended or disbarred in any court; (5) the title of each court and
cause in which the applicant has filed an application to appear as
counsel pro hac vice in this state in the preceding two years,
the date of each application, and whether or not it was granted; and (6) the
name, address, and telephone number of the active licensees of the State Bar of
California who are the attorneys of record for the case. (See Cal. Rules
of Court Rule 9.40(d).)
 
Ms. Dombey’s
declaration contains all of the information required by Rule 9.40(d). The Court
grants her application. 
 
The attorney’s
application to be admitted pro hac vice is granted.
