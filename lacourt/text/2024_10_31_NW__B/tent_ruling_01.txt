Plaintiff United Financial Casualty
Company’s Request for Default Judgment
 
Defendant: Sargis Tovmasyan
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff United Financial Casualty
Company’s request for default judgment against Defendant Sargis Tovmasyan is DENIED.
            
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from an August 23, 2019,
motor vehicle accident. Plaintiff United Financial Casualty Company
(“Plaintiff”) alleges that Defendant Sargis Tovmasyan (“Defendant”),
negligently operating their motor vehicle, caused property damage to their
insured.
 
On June 16, 2022, Plaintiff filed a
complaint alleging one cause of action for motor vehicle negligence.
 
On June 5, 2024, the case was reassigned
to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East,
effective June 24, 2024.
 
On June 28, 2024, Defendant entered
default. Plaintiff then filed the instant request for default judgment against Defendant.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 585 permits
entry of a default judgment after a party has failed to timely respond or
appear. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 585.) A party seeking judgment on the
default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief
summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support
of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a
memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration of nonmilitary status;
(6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom
judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579,
supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary;
and (9) a request for attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement
of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800.) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff seeks damages in the amount of
$52,150.45, representing $51,631.45 in general and special damages and $519.00
in costs.
 
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment
is DENIED for the following deficiencies:
 
1.     
Plaintiff failed to file a copy of
Defendant’s Statement of Damages. A copy was provided as to dismissed party Javier
Cazares, but not as to Defendant Tovmasyan. (CRC 3.250(a)(20).)
2.     
Plaintiff failed to complete Item 2 on
CIV-100 in full. Special damages and general damages must be specified.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
