MOTION
In four separately
filed motions, Plaintiff Yuehua Guo (“Plaintiff”)” moves to compel further
responses from Defendant AWA Forged Composites, LLC (“Defendant”) to Requests
for Production of Documents, set one (“RPD”), Form Interrogatories, set one
(“FROG”), Special Interrogatories, set one (“SROG”), and Requests for
Admission, set one (“RFA”).  Defendant
has not opposed the motions. 
 
ANALYSIS
As of May 9, 2024,
Defendant is without counsel, whose motion to be relieved as counsel for all
named defendants was granted on May 3, 2024, and notice was served on May 9,
2024.  As Defendant is an entity, it
cannot represent itself.  (Gamet v.
Blanchard (2001) 91 Cal. App. 4th 1276, 1284 fn. 5.)  The court, therefore, in accordance with CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1148-1150In
particular, , continues the matter to July 12, 2024 to provide Defendant with
an opportunity to retain counsel to oppose the motions.  The court gives notice that, if Defendant has
not retained counsel and opposed the motion by that date, the court intends to
enter an order granting Plaintiff’s motions to compel an awarding Plaintiff
sanctions in keeping with the discussion  below.  
If the propounding
party deems responses to interrogatories, requests for production of documents,
or requests for admissions unsatisfactory, the propounding party may move to
compel further responses.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.300, 2031.310, 2033.290.)  
Defendant’s
responses to the RPDs, FROGs, SROGs, and RFAs at issue consist of boilerplate
objections.  As Plaintiff timely filed
these motions to compel further responses, Defendant has the burden to justify its
objections.  (Fairmont Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.) 
Defendant has not opposed this motion and, therefore, cannot meet that
burden.  
In particular, Plaintiff
notes it has moved to compel further responses to the SROGs because Defendant
references other documents instead of providing complete responses. Defendant’s
responses are insufficient. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1984) 84 Cal.App.3d 771,
783-784.)  To respond to interrogatories
by reference to documents, the responding party must specify responding to the
interrogatories requires a compilation, abstract, audit or summary of records
and identify the documents from which the answer may be derived.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, Fuss v.
Superior Court (1969) 273 Cal.App.2d 807, 815-817.)   Defendant
has not satisfied these requirements in this instance.
While Defendant
agreed to comply with some of Plaintiff’s RPDs, Defendant has not produced
responsive documents.  The court may
compel a party to comply with its agreement to produce documents in response to
a request for production of documents. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320, subd.
(a).)  The court, therefore, would grant Plaintiff’s motion regarding the RPDs and order Defendant to produce
responsive documents within two weeks of this court’s order.   The court
concludes Defendant’s failure to properly respond to the discovery at issue is
an abuse of the discovery process and awards Plaintiff sanctions.  Consequently, the court imposes sanctions against Defendant
in the amount of $2,940, which represents six hours of attorney time at $450 per
hour to prepare the motions and to attend the hearing, plus filing fees.
Plaintiff is
ordered to give notice of this order and file proof of service of same.
