And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel arbitration. The plaintiff, Negar Matian, has a 5% membership interest in 14143-7 Burbank Blvd LLC and has filed a petition to compel arbitration against the defendants, who are also members of the company. The dispute arose when the defendants denied that the plaintiff is a member of the company, and the plaintiff demanded arbitration. The plaintiff has met its burden of producing prima facie evidence of a written agreement to arbitrate the dispute, which is contained in the company's operating agreement. The agreement provides for arbitration in the event of a dispute, and the plaintiff has alleged that the defendants have refused to participate in arbitration. The judge has ordered the parties to arbitrate the dispute, and a status review/OSC re: dismissal is set for September 4, 2025.
