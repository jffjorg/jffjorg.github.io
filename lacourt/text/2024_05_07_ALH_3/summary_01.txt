And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants plaintiff Yanhong Xing's motions to deem admitted the truth of matters in her requests for admissions, and also grants her request for monetary sanctions. The defendants, Shunjun Zhang and Meiju Group, LLC, failed to respond to the requests for admissions, which is a mandatory requirement under California law. As a result, the court imposes monetary sanctions against each defendant in the amount of $460. The court's order is tentative and may be modified or adopted as a final order after the hearing on May 7, 2024.
