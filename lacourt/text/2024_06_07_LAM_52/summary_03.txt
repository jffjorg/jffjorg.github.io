And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted Defendant Abel Rivera's motion to set aside the default and default judgment against him. The judge finds that Abel Rivera did not receive actual notice of the summons and complaint in time to defend the action, and that his lack of notice was not caused by his own avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect. The judge cites the policy favoring trial on the merits and finds that Abel Rivera has presented sufficient evidence to show that he lacked actual notice in time to defend the action. The court hereby vacates the default and default judgment for possession of the premises entered against Abel Rivera and quashes the writ of possession issued by the clerk. Abel Rivera is ordered to file his proposed answer forthwith.
