 Case Number:  23STCV07063    Hearing Date:   June 7, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff Hayley Sipe’s Motions to Compel Responses Without
Objections to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for
Production 
            Plaintiff
Hayley Sipe moves to compel defendant SXC Studio City, LLC (SXC) to respond
without objections to form interrogatories – employment law, special
interrogatories, and requests for production, set one.  When the responding party fails to timely
respond to interrogatories or requests for production, the requesting party may
move for an order compelling responses. 
(CCP §§ 2030.290(b) [interrogatories], 2031.300(b) [requests for
production].)  Failing
to timely respond waives any objections. 
(CCP §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a).) 

            Plaintiff
is entitled to orders compelling SXC to respond to these discovery
requests.  Plaintiff served this
discovery on February 1, 2024.  (Ranen
Decls., ¶ 2, Ex. A.)  Responses were due
March 5.  SXC had not served any
responses as of April 24, 2024, when plaintiff filed these motions.  (Id., ¶ 13.)  SXC did not timely respond to form interrogatories, special
interrogatories, and requests for production, set one.  SXC therefore waived any objections to them.
Sanctions
On each motion, plaintiff moves for $1,558.50 in
sanctions against SXC and its counsel, Sina Law Group.  Failing to respond to an authorized method of
discovery is a misuse of the discovery process subject to monetary
sanctions.  (CCP § 2023.010(d).)  SXC did not respond to authorized
discovery.  SXC did not act with
substantial justification.  Sanctions are
just under the circumstances.  
 Plaintiff did
not, however, reasonably incur $1,558.50 in expenses for each motion.  That amount includes 0.5
hours to review the opposition and 1 hour to prepare a reply at $450 hourly.  (Palencia Decls., ¶ 2.)  SXC did not file any oppositions.  Plaintiff filed only notices of
non-opposition, not reply briefs. 
Plaintiff therefore reasonably incurred 1.83 hours of attorney fees ($823.50)
plus the $60 filing fee on each motion.
