MOTION
FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS
 
 
Meet and Confer:
 
Before filing a motion for judgment on
the pleadings, “the moving party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone,
or by video conference with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to
the motion for judgment on the pleadings for the purpose of determining if an
agreement can be reached that resolves the claims to be raised in the motion
for judgment on the pleadings.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 439, subd. (a).)
 
Counsel for Defendant
met and conferred with counsel for Plaintiffs regarding this motion via
telephone on November 8, 2024, but the parties were unable to reach a
resolution. (Bennett Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. B.) The Court deems these efforts
sufficient.
 
Analysis
 
Allstate Northbrook Indemnity Company
(Defendant) moves for judgment on the pleadings against the first amended
complaint (FAC) of Maria Garcia et al. (Plaintiffs). The motion is granted.
 
A.    Legal Standard
 
A
motion for judgment on the pleadings may be made after the time to demur has
expired and an answer has been filed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (f).) A
motion by a defendant may be made on the grounds that the complaint or
cross-complaint “does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action against that defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c)(B)(ii).) A
motion for judgment on the pleadings has the same function as a general
demurrer but is made after the time for demurrer has expired. Except as
provided by statute, the rules governing demurrers apply. (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999.)  Pursuant to Code Civ Proc. Section 438(d) the
Court shall consider not only the face of the pleading, but also any matter of
which the Court is required to take judicial notice.   
 
Like
a general demurrer, “ordinarily, a [motion for judgment on the pleadings] does
not lie as to a portion of a cause of action, and if any part of a cause of
action is properly pleaded, the [motion] will be overruled.” (Fire Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452.) In considering a motion for judgment on the
pleadings, courts consider whether properly pled factual allegations—assumed to
be true and liberally construed—are sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
(Stone Street Capital, LLC v. Cal. State
Lottery Com’n (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 109, 116.)
 
When a demurrer is sustained, the Court determines
whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  When
a plaintiff “has pleaded the general set of facts upon which his cause of
action is based,” the court should give the plaintiff an opportunity to amend
his complaint, since plaintiff should not “be deprived of his right to maintain
his action on the ground that his pleadings were defective for lack of
particulars.” (Reed v. Norman (1957) 152 Cal.App.2d 892, 900.) 
 
B.     Discussion
 
This action arises out of an automobile
collision that occurred on August 26, 2017. (FAC ¶ 1.) Plaintiffs allege causes
of action for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith
and fair dealing, violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200,
unjust enrichment, injunctive relief, and declaratory relief.  
 
            Uninsured motorist (UM) coverage
claims must be determined by an agreement between the insurer and the insured,
or through arbitration. (Ins. Code, § 11580.2, subd. (f).) No cause of action can
accrue to an individual availing themselves of UM coverage under Insurance Code
section 11580.2 unless, within two years of the date of the accident, the insured:
(1) files a suit against the uninsured motorist; (2) reaches an agreement as to
the amount due under the policy; or (3) formally institutes arbitration proceedings.
(Id.,
§ 11580.2, subd. (i)(1).) Arbitration proceedings instituted pursuant to this
section shall conclude within five years from the institution of the
proceeding. (Id., § 11580.2, subd. (i)(2)(A).) This
limitations period acts similarly to a dismissal for failure to prosecute. (Santangelo
v. Allstate Ins. Co. (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 804, 813–814.)
 
On October 16, 2024, the Court ruled
that Plaintiffs’ UM claims are barred under Insurance Code section 11580.2,
subdivision (i)(2)(A), because more than five years have passed since the
institution of arbitration proceedings. Defendant now moves for judgment on the
pleadings as to all causes of action on the basis that any benefits Plaintiffs
were previously entitled to are now time-barred, causing Plaintiffs’ causes of
action to fail as a matter of law.
 
            Plaintiffs’ cause of action for
breach of contract fails as a matter of law.
 
            Defendant argues that Plaintiffs
cannot state a claim for breach of contract considering the Court’s previous
ruling. The elements for a cause of action for breach of contract are: (1) the
existence of a contract; (2) the plaintiff’s performance or excuse for
nonperformance; (3) defendant’s breach; and (4) damage to plaintiff therefrom.
(Property California SCJLW One Corp. v. Leamy (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th
1155, 1162.) Generally, an insured may pursue a breach of contract claim
against an insurer by alleging “the insurance contract, the insured’s
performance or excuse for nonperformance, the insurer’s breach, and resulting
damages.” (Case v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., Inc. (2018) 30
Cal.App.5th 397, 402 (Case).) Because contract-related damages are
required, the insured’s cause of action for breach of contract fails if there
are no unpaid policy benefits. (Ibid.)
 
Here, Defendant does not contest the
existence of a contract between it and Plaintiffs. Rather, Defendant argues
that Plaintiffs cannot show that they suffered any damages because Plaintiffs’
UM claims are now time-barred by Insurance Code section 11580.2. Plaintiffs
allege damages in the form of “unpaid policy benefits, interest on contract
amounts owed, and other out-of-pocket expenses, as well as consequential
damages, in a sum exceeding $100,000.00.” (FAC ¶ 52.) Because Plaintiffs’ UM
benefits are now time-barred, Defendant no longer owes Plaintiffs any unpaid
policy benefits. Thus, Plaintiffs’ cause of action fails under Case, as
Plaintiffs cannot prove any damages because they are no longer entitled to UM
benefits, having failed to arbitrate them within the limitations period. Accordingly,
the Court grants the motion of Defendant on Plaintiffs’ first cause of action
for breach of contract. 
 
Plaintiffs’ cause of action
for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing fails as a
matter of law.
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiffs are
also barred from stating a cause of action for breach of the implied covenant
of good faith and fair dealing. There are two separate requirements for
establishing breach of the implied covenant: “(1) benefits due under the policy
must have been withheld; and (2) the reason for withholding benefits must have
been unreasonable or without proper cause.” (Love v. Fire Ins. Exchange
(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1151.) Thus, a bad faith claim may not be
maintained where benefits are no longer due. (Id. at p. 1153.) Here, as discussed above,
Plaintiffs are not entitled to UM benefits because they failed to arbitrate
their claims within the five-year limitations period. Thus, Plaintiffs cannot
maintain a cause of action for breach of the implied covenant. Accordingly, the
Court grants the motion of Defendant on Plaintiffs’ second cause of action.
 
Plaintiffs’ cause of action under the
Unfair Competition Law fails as a matter of law.
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiffs are
also barred from stating a cause of action under the Unfair Competition Law
(UCL). Unfair competition includes “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business
act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising.” (Bus.
& Prof. Code, § 17200.) A court may issue injunctive relief to “restore to
any person in interest any money or property, real or personal, which may have
been acquired by means of such unfair competition.” (Id., § 17203.) A
party alleging unfair competition under section 17200 must “state with
reasonable particularity the facts supporting the statutory elements of the
violation.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th
612, 619 (Khoury).) Actions may only be brought by a private individual
if that person has “suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a
result of the unfair competition.” (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17204.)
 
Here, Plaintiffs cannot show that they
have lost money or property as a result of any unfair competition, because they
are not owed any UM benefits, as discussed above. Thus, Plaintiffs’ cause of
action fails as a matter of law, as they are unable to allege all the required
statutory elements of a UCL violation. Accordingly, the Court grants the motion
of Defendant as to Plaintiffs’ third cause of action.
 
Plaintiffs’ cause of action for unjust
enrichment fails as a matter of law.
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiffs’ fourth
cause of action for unjust enrichment fails as well. The causes of action for
unjust enrichment and restitution are interchangeable. One who is enriched at
the expense of another is required to make restitution. (Prof. Tax Appeal v.
Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 230, 238 (Kennedy-Wilson).)
The elements of a cause of action for unjust enrichment or restitution are
“receipt of a benefit and unjust retention of the benefit at the expense of
another.” (Ibid.)
 
Here, Plaintiffs allege that the
relevant benefit consists of the insurance premiums they paid Defendant leading
up to the accident given Defendant’s subsequent failure to pay Plaintiffs’
claim. (FAC ¶¶ 57–58.) However, Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that Defendant
owed Plaintiffs any benefits under the insurance policy, since these benefits
are now barred by Insurance Code section 11580.2, subdivision (i)(2)(A). Thus, Defendant
has not been unjustly enriched through Plaintiffs’ payment of premiums under
the terms of the contract between the parties, and Plaintiffs have failed to
plead a cause of action for unjust enrichment. Accordingly, the Court grants
the motion of Defendant as to Plaintiffs’ fourth cause of action.
 
Plaintiffs’ fifth and sixth causes of
action for declaratory and injunctive relief are moot. 
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiffs’
causes of action for injunctive and declaratory relief are moot. With respect
to injunctive relief, Plaintiffs request that the Court issue a “permanent
injunction prohibiting the Defendant from requiring that any aspect of the arbitration
be bifurcated, and further that Defendants . . . be estopped from contacting
either directly or indirectly any Plaintiffs, for any reason, without the
express consent of their attorneys of record.” (FAC ¶ 57.) Plaintiffs’ request
concerning the bifurcation of arbitration proceedings is moot given that those
proceedings have been dismissed by the Court. And Plaintiffs’ other request
concerning the prevention of communication between Defendant and Plaintiffs is
moot given the dispositive nature of the present motion.
 
With respect to declaratory relief,
Plaintiffs request that the Court “issue a declaratory order including the
determination that Defendants have waived any rights to compel arbitration due
to their untimely petition for the same.” (Id. ¶ 62.) This request is
moot given that the Court has already compelled, and later dismissed,
arbitration. Plaintiffs further request that the Court issue a declaratory
order determining that the arbitration agreement between Plaintiffs and
Defendant is unenforceable. (Id. ¶ 63.) This request is moot for the
same reason. Thus, Plaintiffs have not pled facts sufficient to support a cause
of action for either injunctive or declaratory relief. Additionally, the Court
does not find any reasonable possibility that Plaintiffs’ may cure the defects
in their FAC if granted leave to amend, given that their causes of action rely
on insurance benefits which are irretrievable given the statutory time bar on
their arbitration. Accordingly, the Court grants the motion of Defendant as to
Plaintiffs’ fifth and sixth causes of action and does not grant leave to amend
as to any cause of action.
 
Conclusion :
 
            The motion is granted, without leave to
amend. Counsel for Defendant is to prepare and submit a proposed Judgment.
