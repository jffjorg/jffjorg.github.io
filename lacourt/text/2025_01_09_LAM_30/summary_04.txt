And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to Plaintiff Maria Reyes' motion to compel further responses to deposition questions from Defendant Living Spaces Manufacturing, LLC. The judge finds that the motion is stayed pending participation in an informal discovery conference (IDC) because the parties did not participate in an IDC before filing the motion. The judge notes that under Local Court Rules, the court will not hear a discovery motion unless the parties have participated in an IDC. The judge also notes that the parties met and conferred following the deposition, but Plaintiff did not agree to continue the deposition testimony and canceled the second day of testimony. The judge does not impose sanctions and stays the motion pending participation in an IDC.
