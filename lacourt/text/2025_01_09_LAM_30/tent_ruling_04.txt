MOTION
TO COMPEL DISCOVERY 
 
Tentative Ruling:
Local Court Rules:
Department 30
 
            Defendant asserts that Plaintiff did not participate in
an informal discovery conference prior to moving to compel further responses.
Local Court rules dictate “The court will not hear a discovery motion, other
than a motion to compel where there has been no response, until the parties
participate in an informal discovery conference with the court.” The present
motion qualifies under this rule, since Defendant produced a PMQ for deposition
and Plaintiff objects to Defendant’s responses at that deposition.
 
            On September 24, 2024, Plaintiff took the deposition of
Defendant’s PMQ. (Chami Decl. ¶ 4.) Defendant’s counsel objected to many
questions at the deposition and advised the PMQ not to answer questions. (Id.
¶ 5.) The parties met and conferred following the deposition, with Defendant’s
counsel agreeing to another day of deposition testimony on October 10. (Chang
Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. 3.) Plaintiff did not agree to this proposal and canceled the
second day of deposition testimony already set for September 28. (Id. ¶¶
6–7, Exs. 4–5.) Plaintiff did not request or participate in an informal
discovery conference prior to filing the motion. Because the present motion
seeks to compel further responses to deposition questions where Defendant has
already offered a response, local rules dictate that Plaintiff first
participate in an informal discovery conference. Accordingly, the present
motion is stayed pending participation in an IDC. 
 
            The Court does not impose sanctions as the present motion
is stayed
            The Court stays
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to deposition questions pending
participation in an informal discovery conference.
