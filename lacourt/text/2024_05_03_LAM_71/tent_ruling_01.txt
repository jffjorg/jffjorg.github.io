 Hearing Date:  May 3, 2024



 
Petitioner
ABP Parcel 8, LLC’s motion for attorneys’
fees and interest is granted. Petitioner’s motion for attorneys’ fees is
granted in the reduced total amount of $242,194.00, and interest from the date
of the Arbitration Award on October 10, 2023, to the date of the instant
hearing on May 3, 2024, in the amount of $159,688.59, plus $775.19 each day
thereafter.  
 
Petitioner ABP Parcel 8, LLC (“ABP”) (“Petitioner”)
moves for an order awarding it attorneys’ fees and interest against Respondent Marina Pacifica,
LLC (“MP”) (“Respondent”) as the prevailing party in the instant case by way of
the Court granting Petitioner’s petition to confirm the arbitration award
(“Award”) and denial of Respondent’s cross-petition to vacate (“March 29
Ruling”).  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-2; Civ. Code §1717.)  Petitioner moves on the basis (1) there is a contractual
prevailing party attorney’s fees provision as declared in the Award and March
29 Ruling; (2) Petitioner was awarded prevailing party attorney’s fees and
costs in the Award; and (3) the court ruled that Petitioner may move for
attorney’s fees and interest in this case.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)
 
Background
On
October 25, 2023, Petitioner filed its Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award,
and later on October 27, 2023, Petitioner filed its Notice of Petition and
Hearing on Petition.  On November 3,
2023, Respondent filed its opposition to Petitioner’s petition, as well as its
cross-petition to vacate the contractual arbitration award.  On December 15, 2023, Petitioner filed its
reply to its petition and opposition to Respondent’s cross-petition.  Respondent filed its reply to its
cross-petition on January 26, 2024.
On
February 28, 2024, this Court heard argument on parties’ motions and took the
matters under submission.  On March 29,
2024, this Court granted Petitioner’s petition and denied Respondent’s
cross-petition.  (3/29/24 Minute Order (Ruling
on Submitted Matter).)
On
April 8, 2024, Petitioner filed the instant motion.   On April 15, 2024, Petitioner filed its
Memorandum of Costs.  On April 22, 2024,
Respondent filed its opposition.  On
April 26, 2024, Petitioner filed its reply.
 
Discussion
Civil Code §1717(a) provides, in part:
In any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that
attorney’s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce the contract, shall be
awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party
who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she
is the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable
attorney’s fees in addition to other costs.
 
(Civ. Code §1717(a).)
A party who obtains an “unqualified
victory” on a contract dispute is considered the prevailing party for purposes
of Civil Code §1717 as a matter of law.  (Hsu v. Abbara (1995) 9 Cal.4th 863,
876-877.)  Additionally, the phrase
“prevailing party” is understood to include,
[T]he party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a
dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains
any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any
relief against that defendant. If any party recovers other than monetary
relief and in situations other than as specified, the ‘prevailing party’ shall
be as determined by the court, and under those circumstances, the court, in its
discretion, may allow costs or not and, if allowed, may apportion costs between
the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules adopted under
Section 1034.  
 
(C.C.P. §1032(a)(4), emphasis added.)
Here, the Award provides, “Paragraph 23
of both Ground Leases contain a provision for attorney’s fees to be awarded to
the prevailing party. (Exhs. 8, 15) This is confirmed in the written term sheet
and release agreement entered into August 31, 2021, and is consistent with JAMS
Rule 24(f).”  (10/25/23 Petition, Attach.
8(c) [“Award”] at pg. 9.)  Paragraph 23
declares: “Should either party hereto institute any action or proceeding in
court to enforce any provision hereof or for damages by reason of an alleged
breach of any provision of this Lease, except as may otherwise be specified in
this Lease, the prevailing party shall be entitled to receive from the losing
party such amount as the court may adjudge to be reasonable attorneys’ fees . .
. in such action or proceeding.”
The arbitration order awarding fees and
costs states:
Paragraph 23 of the Ground Leases says: [quoting]. [¶] ABP argues that
this language means that fees are available either “to enforce any provision
hereof” or “for damages by reason of an alleged breach of any provision of this
Lease,” and that “enforcement” of a provision of contract includes declaratory
relief. See Cussler v. Crusader Ent., LLC (2012) 212 Cal. App. 4th 356,
365-366 (provision granting either party the right to recover attorneys’ fees
in the event of litigation ‘on the contract’ includes declaratory relief). 
 
ABP’s reading of Paragraph 23 is reasonable.
Its reasonableness is borne out by the fact that MP also prayed for an award of
attorney’s fees and costs under the same language. MP further argues that ABP did not
include a request for fees in its baseball statement, and, after having successfully
urged the Arbitrator to rule that only a single baseball statement could be
adopted, ABP cannot now be heard to seek relief it did not include there. ABP counters
that this case is not an “amount of money damages” baseball choice under JAMS
Rule 33(a), and therefore, under JAMS Rule 33(d), the provisions of JAMS Rule
24 apply. JAMS Rule 24(g) provides that the Arbitrator may allocate attorneys’
fees if provided by the parties’ agreement or allowed by applicable law. ABP’s
reading of the JAMS Rules is correct, and, since the parties’ agreement
provides for fees, ABP, as the prevailing party, is entitled to fees.
 
(Decl. of Bertzyk ¶4, Exh. 2 at pgs.
2-3.)
The foregoing is determinative and
applies equally to awarding fees for this petition case.  Arbitration awards have res judicata and
collateral estoppel effect. (See, e.g., JPV I L.P. v. Koetting (2023)
88 Cal.App.5th 172, 192 [“[I]t is well settled that an arbitration award may
provide the basis for issue preclusion.”].)
Further, under Civil Code §1717, “[i]f
any party recovers other than monetary relief and in situations other than as
specified, the ‘prevailing party’ shall be as determined by the court.”  (C.C.P. §1032(a)(4).)  Here, the Court determined Petitioner is the
prevailing party.  (3/29/24 Minute Order (Ruling
on Submitted Matter) at pg. 10.)
Accordingly, ABP is the undisputed
prevailing party in this action and is entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees.
 
Reasonable
Fees
To calculate
a lodestar amount, the Court must first determine the reasonableness of the
hourly rates sought by Petitioner’s counsel. The Supreme Court of California
has concluded that a reasonable hourly lodestar rate is the prevailing rate for
private attorneys “conducting non-contingent litigation of the same type.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1133, emphasis added.)
Petitioner’s
Counsel declares the following hourly rates for attorneys who worked on this
case based on the JAMS Rate approved by Judge Elizabeth A. White (Ret.) during
the arbitration: (1) Erika Arambula ($260.00/hour in 2023, $290.00/hour in 2024);
(2) Timothy Baumann ($400.00/hour); (3) Yvette Etnire ($275.00/hour); (4) Jules
L. Kabat ($800.00/hour); (5) Alexandra Loew ($90.00/hour and $225.00 in 2023, and
$100.00/hour in 2024); (6) Nate D. Meyer ($550.00/hour); (7) Don Moody ($125.00/hour
in 2023, $135.00/hour in 2024); (8) Matthew Rips ($650.00/hour); and (9) KeiAna
Sanderlin ($75.00/hour).  (Decl. of Kabat
¶8, Exh. B.)  Petitioner has sufficiently
demonstrated its counsel’s hourly rates are reasonable in their community of
practice in their specialized area of law. 
(Decl. of Kabat ¶¶4-8, Exh. B.)
Respondent challenges
Petitioner’s counsel’s hourly rates. 
(Opposition, pgs. 8-9.)  Petitioner’s
counsel’s declarations of work, hours, fees, etc. are entitled to a presumption
of credibility, including respecting an attorney’s professional judgment as to
whether time spent was reasonably appropriate to the matter.  (See, e.g., Horsford v. Board
of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396 [“We
think the verified time statements of the attorney as officers of the court are
entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are
erroneous.”].)  Therefore, the Court
determines Petitioner’s counsel’s hourly rates are reasonable.
 
Billed
Hours
The party
seeking fees and costs bears the burden to show “the fees incurred were
allowable, were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and were
reasonable in amount.”  (Nightingale
v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.) 
In this
case, the declarations and billing records provided by Petitioner’s counsel are
sufficient to meet the burden of proving the reasonableness of the claimed fees
in terms of amounts and tasks. To satisfy this burden, evidence and
descriptions of billable tasks must be presented in sufficient detail, enabling
the court to evaluate whether the case was overstaffed, the time attorneys
spent on specific claims, and the reasonableness of the hours expended.  (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 486-487.)
Petitioner’s
counsel’s fee recovery is based on the 464 hours spent litigating this case.  (Decl. of Kabat ¶8, Exh. B.)  Respondent argues Plaintiffs’ counsel’s
billed hours were overbilled. 
(Opposition, pgs. 3-8.)  The Court
has reviewed Respondent’s objections to Petitioner’s counsel’s billed hours
finds them to be unavailing.  A losing
party cannot litigate aggressively only to complain too much work addressed its
aggressiveness or dispute that concomitant fees should be fully compensatory,
including for obtaining the fees award.  (See, e.g., Peak-Las Positas
Partners v. Bollag (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 101, 114 [“A
defendant cannot litigate tenaciously and then be heard to complain about the
time necessarily spent by the plaintiff in response, in disputing the amount of
a contractual attorney fee award.”].)
          Respondent objects to Petitioner’s
hours billed on three grounds.  First, Respondent’s
objection to Petitioner billing $61,308.00 in fees for
“checking
boxes and writing less than 10 sentences,” on its form petition to confirm the
arbitration award is not supported by legal argument and does not meet the
requisite specificity to challenge Petitioner’s fees.  Therefore, Respondent failed to meet its
burden to challenge Petitioner’s fees on its motion to confirm the arbitration
award.
          Second and Third, Respondent’s
objections to Petitioner’s 12/20/23 time entry by Nathan D. Meyer and 12/21/23
time entry by Matthew A. Rips are unavailing. 
Petitioner submitted a supplemental declaration clarifying that the times
billed were to review Respondent’s notice of related cases.  (Supp.-Decl. of Kabat ¶8.)
Accordingly,
Petitioner’s requested fees are granted in the requested amount of $195,235.
 
Motion
for Attorneys’ Fees
Petitioner’s
counsel requests an additional $46,959.00 in fees, or 73.40 hours, for oral
argument at the hearing on the Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award and on the
instant motion for attorney’s fees: (1) 51.70 hours and $13,925 fees preparing
for and conducting oral argument on the petition; and 38.10 hours and $22,115
fees through filing this motion.  (Reply,
pg. 11; Supp.-Decl. of Kabat ¶5, Exh, A.) 
Petitioner estimates that preparing for, appearing in court and
conducting the instant hearing will entail at least another 15 hours by Kabat
and Meyer.  (Reply, pg. 11.)  Anticipated fees are not fees reasonably
incurred, and accordingly, the Court will not grant the anticipated 15
additional hours, or $20,250, requested. 
Accordingly, the Court grants Petitioner the reduced total of $46,959.00
in fees incurred on the instant motion and for oral argument on the Petition to
Confirm Arbitration Award.
 
Interest
Like judgments,
arbitration awards impose res judicata and collateral estoppel certainty: “it
is well settled that an arbitration award may provide the basis for issue
preclusion.”  (JPV I L.P., 88
Cal.App.5th at pg. 192.)  The judicial
council petition to affirm an arbitration award states interest is properly
sought at “the statutory rate.”  (See
Petition §10(d).)
Respected as having
the legal consequence of judgments, arbitration awards should bear C.C.P.
§685.010 “statutory rate” 10% interest.  Arbitration
awards are not mere sum certain contracts limited to Civil Code §3287 7%
interest.  The Award was made on October
10, 2023.  (See Petition §8a,
cross-petition to
vacate §8a.)  The Award gave $2,829,433.78 to ABP.  From that date to the date of the instant
hearing on May 3, 2024, is 206 days, resulting in interest at the rate of 10%
of $159,688.59, plus $775.19 each day thereafter.
          Accordingly, Petitioners are entitled
to interest of $159,688.59 to the date of this hearing on May 3, 2024, plus
$775.19 each day thereafter.
 
Conclusion
Accordingly, Petitioner’s
motion for attorneys’
fees is granted in the reduced total amount of $242,194.00, and interest from
the date of the Arbitration Award on October 10, 2023, to the date of the
instant hearing on May 3, 2024, in the amount of $159,688.59, plus $775.19 each
day thereafter.
