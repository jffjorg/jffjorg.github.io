Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has granted Defendant's unopposed motion to compel James P. Hall, D.O. (Dr. Hall) to comply with Defendant's Deposition Subpoena for Production of Business Records. The subpoena seeks records related to the mental state of Decedent Le'Wayne Anthony Wright, which is relevant to the lawsuit. The court finds that the records are well within the scope of permissible discovery and that Dr. Hall's privacy concerns do not outweigh the need for discovery. The court notes that the subpoena was properly issued and that the Defendant has exhausted all legal avenues to obtain the requested records.
