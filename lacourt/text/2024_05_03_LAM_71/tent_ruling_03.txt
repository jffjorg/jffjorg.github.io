Plaintiff Areeb Pirani (“Pirani”) (“Plaintiff”)
moves unopposed to compel further responses from Defendant Faisal Iqbal
(“Iqbal”) (“Defendant”) to his Request for Production of Documents (Set One)
(“RFP”).  (Notice Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§2031.310,
et seq.)  Plaintiff further requests
monetary sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $2,897.00.  (Notice Motion, pg. 2.)
The
Court denies Plaintiff’s motion on the basis Plaintiff failed to follow the
Information Regarding Procedures in Department 71, which requires that “[p]arties
seeking to compel further responses to discovery, must schedule an Informal Discovery
Conference (IDC) before the Court will hear their motions. The Court may deny a
motion to compel further responses to discovery if parties fail to schedule and
complete an IDC before the scheduled hearing on the motion.”  (Information Regarding Procedures, pg. 4.)
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s unopposed motion is denied, and Plaintiff’s request for sanctions
against Defendant is denied.
Moving
Party to give notice.
