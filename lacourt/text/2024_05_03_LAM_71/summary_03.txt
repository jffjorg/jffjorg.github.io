The judge has also denied Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,897.00. The judge's decision is based on the fact that Plaintiff failed to follow the procedures in Department 71, which requires that parties schedule an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) before the Court will hear their motions.
