And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the motion to amend judgment filed by Marius Denisiu, the judgment creditor, to add Patricia Stephenson and Stori Bolton as additional judgment debtors. The motion is based on the theory that Stephenson and Bolton are alter egos of the original judgment debtor, Executive Network Enterprises, Inc., dba Executive Limousine, and that they are liable for the judgment debt under Labor Code section 558.1. The Judge has found that the evidence presented demonstrates a basis for liability against Stephenson and Bolton as Judgment Debtor's alter egos. The opposition filed by Judgment Debtor, which raises issues of lack of service of the judgment and the sufficiency of the evidence, has been rejected. The Judgment Creditor is ordered to file a proposed amended judgment within 20 days of this order.
