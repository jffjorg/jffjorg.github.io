And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Alejandro Diaz's Motion for Attorney's Fees in the amount of $15,800.00. The Court finds that Plaintiff is the prevailing party in this action and is entitled to attorney's fees under Civil Code section 52. The Court awards attorney's fees based on the lodestar method, which takes into account the number of hours reasonably expended by the attorneys and the reasonable hourly rate. The Court reduces the fee award by $250.00 due to duplicative work performed. Plaintiff is ordered to file and serve a proposed amended judgment within 20 days of this order.
