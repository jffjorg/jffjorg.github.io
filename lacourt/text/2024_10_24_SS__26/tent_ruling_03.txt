v. Velasquez, et al.MOTION FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES
(Civ.
Code § 52; CRC Rule 3.1702)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff
Alejandro Diaz’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED IN THE AMOUNT OF
$15,800.00. PLAINTIFF IS TO FILE AND SERVE A PROPOSED AMENDED JUDGMENT WITHIN
20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
On October 29, 2021, Plaintiff Alejandro Diaz (“Plaintiff”) filed the Complaint in this action against Defendants
Victor A. Velasquez and Melissa Vargas, among others
(“Defendants”). The Complaint alleges a single violation of section 51
of the Unruh Civil Rights Act. (Compl., ¶7.) 
 
The Court overruled Defendants’ demurrer to the Complaint
on February 16, 2022 and they filed an answer the next day. On May 23, 2023,
Defendants filed a notice of related case with respect to Diaz v. Velasquez,
et al., LASC Case No. Case No. 23STLC01386 and a Motion to
Consolidate Cases. The Court granted the Motion to Consolidate on August 2,
2023, designating this case as the lead case. (Minute Order, 08/02/23.) 
 
Defendants filed a
Motion for Order Requiring Plaintiff to Post Security Pursuant to CCP
391.1 as a Vexatious Litigant, or in the alternative, for an Order Dismissing
the Consolidated Cases which was set for hearing on February 28, 2024. The day
before the hearing, February 27, 2024, Defendants took that motion off calendar
and filed another Motion for Order Requiring
Plaintiff to Post Security Pursuant to CCP 391.1 as a Vexatious Litigant, or in
the alternative, for an Order Dismissing the Consolidated Cases. That motion
was denied on May 6, 2024. (Minute Order, 05/06/24.) 
 
The action came for trial on August 5, 2024
after which the Court took the matter under submission. (Minute Order,
08/05/24.) On August 6, 2024, the Court issued its statement of decision in
favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants jointly and severally in the amount
of $8,000.00. (Minute Order, 08/06/24.) 
 
Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs on August 22, 2024. No
opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Timing of
Motion
 
Plaintiff brings the instant Motion pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 52 and Cal. Rules of Court rule 3.1702. A
motion for attorney’s fees must be filed and served with the time for filing a
notice of appeal under Cal. Rules of Court Rule 8.822. (Cal. Rules of Court
Rule 3.1702(a).) Cal. Rules of Court Rule 8.822 states that an attorneys’ fees
motion must be filed within either (1) 30 days after the trial court clerk
served the party filing the motion with notice of entry of judgment; or (2) 90
days after entry of judgment. (Cal. Rules of Court 8.822(1).) Here, the Motion was
timely brought less than 30 days after entry of judgment. 
 
Prevailing Party
 
Plaintiff contends it is entitled to
attorney’s fees as the prevailing party in this action pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 52, subdivision (a), which states:
 
Whoever denies, aids or incites a denial, or
makes any discrimination or distinction contrary to Section 51, 51.5, or 51.6,
is liable for each and every offense for the actual damages, and any amount
that may be determined by a jury, or a court sitting without a jury, up to a
maximum of three times the amount of actual damage but in no case less than
four thousand dollars ($4,000), and any attorney's fees that may be determined
by the court in addition thereto, suffered by any person denied the rights
provided in Section 51, 51.5, or 51.6.
 
(Civ.
Code, § 52, subd. (a).) The Court found Defendants violated Plaintiff’s rights
under Civil Code section 51 on two occasions, and entered judgment in favor of
Plaintiff in the amount of $8,000.00. (Minute Order, 08/06/24, pp. 3-4.)
Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to an award of attorney’s fees as determined
by the Court. 
 
Amount of Attorney’s Fees
 
Plaintiff moves for an award of $16,050.00
in attorney’s fees based on 32.1 hours billed
at $500.00 per hour. (Motion, Mehrban Decl., ¶¶3-4.) The moving party bears the
burden of proof with respect to attorney’s fees. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5,
subd. (c)(5)(A).) Specifically, a party seeking fees has the burden of
showing the fees incurred are “allowable,” are “reasonably necessary to the
conduct of the litigation,” and are “reasonable in amount.”  (Levy v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc.
(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 807, 816.)
 
The Court’s objective is to award attorney’s fees at the fair market value based
on the particular action. (Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) “The reasonable
hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.” (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000)
22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “‘[T]he fee setting inquiry in California
ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate . . . .’” (Ketchum v.
Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1134.) 
The lodestar method is based on the
factors, as relevant to the particular case: “(1) the novelty and difficulty of
the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the
extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.”  (Id. at 1132.) “The ‘‘experienced
trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in
his court, and while his judgment is of course
subject to review, it will not be disturbed unless the appellate court is convinced that it is clearly wrong.’’” (Id.) A negative modifier was appropriate
when duplicative work had been performed.
(Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819.)
 
$500.00 per hour is a reasonable hourly rate
for an attorney with more than 30 years of experience in civil rights cases. (Motion,
Mehrban Decl., ¶4.) The number of hours billed is also reasonable. This was a
contentious case where Defendants filed serveral unsuccessful motions,
including a demurrer to the Complaint and two Motions
for Order Requiring Plaintiff to Post Security Pursuant to CCP 391.1 as
a Vexatious Litigant, or in the alternative, for an Order Dismissing the
Consolidated Cases. The case also went to trial and following entry of judgment
in Plaintiff’s favor, involving the filing of a memorandum of costs and the
instant Motion for Attorney’s Fees. The only time that was not reasonably
incurred was 0.5 hours of time spent to review the opposition to the instant
Motion. As no opposition has been filed, the fee award is reduced by $250.00. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff
Alejandro Diaz’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED IN THE AMOUNT OF $15,800.00.
PLAINTIFF IS TO FILE AND SERVE A PROPOSED AMENDED JUDGMENT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF
