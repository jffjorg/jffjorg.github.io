The Petition was initially filed on February 14, 2024, and was continued to a later date to allow Petitioner to demonstrate service of the petition and notice of the hearing date in accordance with statutory requirements. However, Petitioner has not filed any proof of service, and the judge cannot grant the Petition without compliance with the statutory service requirements. The Petition contains all the required information, but Civil Code section 8486 requires service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing to be made in a specific manner.
