Denisiu v. Executive Network Enterprises, Inc., et 
MOTION TO AMEND JUDGMENT
(CCP § 187)

 
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Judgment Creditor Marius
Denisiu’s Motion to Amend Judgment is GRANTED. JUDGMENT CREDITOR IS TO FILE A
PROPOSED AMENDED JUDGMENT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
On
April 10, 2019, the Court entered judgment in favor of Marius Denisiu (“Judgment
Creditor”) and against Executive Network Enterprises, Inc. dba Executive
Limousine (“Judgment Debtor”) pursuant to an Order, Decision or Award of the
Labor Commissioner.
 
On September 4, 2024, Judgment Creditor filed
the instant Motion to Amend Judgment. Judgement Debtor filed an opposition on
October 14, 2024 and Judgment Creditor replied on October 18, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Judgment Creditor moves
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 187 to add Patricia Stephenson and
Stori Bolton as additional judgment debtors.
 
“Under
section 187, the trial court is authorized to amend a judgment to add
additional judgment debtors.... As a general rule, ‘a court may amend its
judgment at any time so that the judgment will properly designate the real
defendants.’.... Judgments may be amended to add additional judgment debtors on
the ground that a person or entity is the alter ego of the original judgment
debtor.... ‘Amendment of a judgment to add an alter ego “is an equitable
procedure based on the theory that the court is not amending the judgment to
add a new defendant but is merely inserting the correct name of the real
defendant...
 
(Greenspan
v. LADT, LLC (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 486, 508 [citing Hall, Goodhue,
Haisley & Barker, Inc. v. Marconi Conf. Center Bd. (1996) 41
Cal.App.4th 1551, 1554-1555].) Alter ego liability exists when there is such
“unity of interest” and ownership that the individuality or separateness of the
corporation has ceased to exist (or never existed in the first place). (Mesler
v. Bragg Management Co. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 290, 300.) Also, “the facts of the
case must be such that adherence to the “fiction” of the corporation's
“separate existence” would sanction a fraud or promote injustice.” (Ibid.)

 
In support of its alter ego
analysis, the Motion cites Labor Code section 558.1, which states in relevant
part: “Any employer or other person acting on behalf of an employer, who
violates, or causes to be violated, any provision regulating minimum wages or
hours and days of work in any order of the Industrial Welfare Commission, or
violates, or causes to be violated, Sections 203, 226, 226.7, 1193.6, 1194, or
2802, may be held liable as the employer for such violation.” (Lab. Code, §
558.1, subd. (a).) “[T]he term “other person acting on behalf of an employer”
is limited to a natural person who is an owner, director, officer, or managing
agent of the employer . . . .” (Lab. Code, § 558.1, subd. (b).) The Motion is
supported by evidence that Stephenson and Bolton are owners and officers of
Judgment Debtor. (Motion, Denisui Decl., ¶¶2-4; RJN, Exh. 2.) The Court grants
Judgment Creditor’s request for judicial notice of Judgment Debtor’s Statement
of Information filed with the California Secretary of State, pursuant to
Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (c). Judgment Debtor’s Statement of
Information lists Stephenson as Judgment Debtor’s Chief Executive Officer,
Secretary, and Chief Financial Officer. (Id. at RJN, Exh. 2.) It also
lists Bolton as Judgment Debtor’s director. (Ibid.) This evidence
demonstrates a basis for liability against Stephenson and Bolton as Judgment
Debtor’s alter egos. 

 
Judgment Debtor filed an
opposition that appears to be based on lack of service of the judgment. No
authority is cited for why this is a basis to deny the motion to amend
judgment. (Opp., p. 1:14-18.) The opposition also cites a case for the
proposition that a person’s mere status as owners, directors, or officers,
without a showing of personal involvement is not sufficient to impose
liability. The case cited is a Superior Court case, Sydney v. HB Business
Solutions, Inc., Case No. 21STCV12338, which is not controlling authority.
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Judgment Creditor
Marius Denisiu’s Motion to Amend Judgment
is GRANTED. JUDGMENT CREDITOR IS TO FILE A PROPOSED AMENDED JUDGMENT WITHIN 20
DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
