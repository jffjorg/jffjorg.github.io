And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to continue the trial date, which was set for January 27, 2025. The judge has also struck the amended cross-complaint, amended answer, and second amended answer filed by the defendant in 2024, as they were filed without leave of court. The judge based this decision on the defendant's failure to provide a memorandum of points and authorities in support of the motion, which is required by the court's rules. The judge also noted that the defendant failed to serve the motion on the plaintiff, which is a violation of the statutory requirements.
