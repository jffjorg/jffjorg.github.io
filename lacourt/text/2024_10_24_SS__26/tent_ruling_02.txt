TENTATIVE RULING: 
 
Defendant Pablo Nunez’s Motion to Continue Trial Date is DENIED. THE
COURT HEREBY STRIKES THE AMENDED CROSS-COMPLAINT FILED ON JANAURY 31, 2024, THE
AMENDED ANSWER FILED ON FEBRUARY 8, 2024, AND SECOND AMENDED ANSWER FILED ON

ANALYSIS:
 
On October 15, 2019, Plaintiffs United Investment Realty,
Inc. and Sam Oh (“Plaintiffs”) filed the instant action for breach of contract
against Defendant Pablo Nunez (erroneously sued as “Pablo N. Russo”) (“Defendant”).
Following Plaintiffs’ failure to appear at trial on April 13, 2021, the Court
dismissed the action without prejudice. Thereafter, the Court granted
Plaintiffs’ motion to vacate the dismissal and reinstated the trial date on May
27, 2021. (Minute Order, 05/27/21.) 
 
Due to Defendant’s failure to file a responsive pleading,
the Court entered their default on March 21, 2022 and default judgment on June
6, 2022. Defendant filed a motion to vacate default and default judgment on
July 26, 2022, which was never set for hearing. Defendant re-filed the motion
on May 11, 2023. The Motion initially came for hearing on July 11, 2023, at
which time the Court continued the matter and ordered Defendant to file a
supplemental declaration in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure section
2015.5 and with a copy of his proposed responsive pleading. (Minute Order,
07/11/23.) The Court granted the motion to vacate default and default judgment
on September 12, 2023. 
 
Defendant, in propria persona, filed an Answer and
Cross-Complaint on October 18, 2023. Defendant then filed a first amended
cross-complaint, first amended answer, and second amended answer in the first
half of 2024. Those pleadings were filed without leave of Court, and
accordingly, the Court strikes them pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
436, subdivision (b). On May 30, 2024, the Court set the trial date for January
27, 2025. 
 
Defendant filed the instant Motion to Continue Trial Date on
September 4, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The Motion is not accompanied by a proof of service
demonstrating that it, or notice of the hearing date, were served on Plaintiff.
Failure to give notice of a motion is not only a violation of the statutory
requirements but of due process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones v. Otero
(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754, 757.) Also, the Motion is not supported by a
memorandum of points and authorities. “The memorandum must contain a statement
of facts, a concise statement of the law, evidence and arguments relied on, and
a discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks cited in support of the
position advanced.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(b).) Indeed, Defendant’s
failure to provide a memorandum as required by the Rule is an “admission that
the [request] is without merit and cause for its denial.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1113(a), (b); In re Marriage of Falcone & Fyke (2012) 203
Cal.App.4th 964, 976.)
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant Pablo Nunez’s Motion to Continue Trial
Date is DENIED. THE COURT HEREBY STRIKE THE AMENDED CROSS-COMPLAINT FILED ON
JANAURY 31, 2024, THE AMENDED ANSWER FILED ON FEBRUARY 8, 2024, AND SECOND
AMENDED ANSWER FILED ON MAY 9, 2024.
