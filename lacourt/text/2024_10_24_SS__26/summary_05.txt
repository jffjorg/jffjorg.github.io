And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff California Injury PLC's motion to discharge interpleader stakeholder from liability and award costs and fees. The plaintiff initiated an interpleader action against multiple defendants, including Platinum Chiropractor Center, alleging that it holds settlement proceeds in the amount of $7,000.00. The plaintiff claimed more than half the amount for its attorney's fees and costs lien, but the judge found that the plaintiff is not properly an interpleader stakeholder. The judge noted that an attorney cannot assert a lien via an interpleader action as the alleged disinterested stakeholder of the remaining proceeds.
