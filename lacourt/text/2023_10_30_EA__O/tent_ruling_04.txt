[1] Though demurred to on the grounds
of uncertainty, the FAC is not uncertain as used in the context of CCP section
430.10(f). A demurrer for uncertainty will be
sustained only where the complaint is so bad that defendant cannot
reasonably respond—i.e., he or she cannot reasonably
determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are
directed against him or her.” (Weil & Brown, Civil Procedure Before Trial
(The Rutter Group) § 7:85 (emphasis in original); see also Khoury
v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Here,
though there may some need for clarification, the FAC is not “so bad” that
Cascade cannot respond. Therefore, for purposes of this demurrer, only
subdivision (e) will be of focus. 
 
 


[2] To the extent that
Cascade avers “An expired dig ticket does not automatically create liability”
(Demurrer p. 7:14-15), that would involve assessment of more facts and
evidence, which exceeds the scope of a demurrer. 
 


[3] Which would
undermine Cascade’s contention that proximate cause is not sufficiently
alleged. There is a long line of decisions that allow negligence to be pled in
general terms. See e.g., Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747 [“Negligence may be
alleged in general terms; that is, it is sufficient to allege an act was
negligently done without stating the particular omission which rendered it
negligent. [intenral citations omitted]. ‘[T]here is no requirement that [the plaintiff] identify and
allege the precise moment of the injury, or the exact nature of the wrongful
act.’ [internal citation omitted].” Therefore, for clarity, the court is
not sustaining the demurrer on the grounds that it has generally pled
negligence but that the complaint improperly lumps together Defendants.
