  - "To say someone was negligent without explaining what duty they owed (statutory or common law) and why they owed it, and how they breached said duty does not apprise Cascade of the allegations against it."
  - "Pleadings like this that assert multiple claims against multiple defendants without specifying which defendants are liable for which acts or omissions make it difficult for defendants to make informed responses to a Plaintiff's allegations."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by Cascade Drilling, L.P. (Cascade) to the first four causes of action asserted against it by Southern California Edison Company (SCE). The court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend. The court finds that the complaint lacks sufficient details to apprise Cascade of the allegations against it. Specifically, the complaint fails to differentiate between the duties owed by Cascade and the consulting engineers to SCE, and what each defendant supposedly did or failed to do. The court also finds that the complaint improperly lumps allegations against multiple defendants without specifying which defendants are liable for which acts or omissions. The court concludes that the complaint does not state a cause of action and grants leave to amend.
