And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment with prejudice. The plaintiff, Rebecca Castillo, is a visually impaired and legally blind individual who filed suit against the defendant for violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (UCRA). However, the judge found that the plaintiff's complaint fails to plead particular, sufficient facts that establish an UCRA violation. Specifically, the complaint lacks specific, relevant facts that support a cause of action and fails to state a cognizable cause of action against the defendant. The judge further found that the plaintiff's complaint does not demonstrate a connection between the website barriers and a physical location, which is necessary to establish a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or intentional discrimination under the UCRA. Therefore, the judge denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment with prejudice.
