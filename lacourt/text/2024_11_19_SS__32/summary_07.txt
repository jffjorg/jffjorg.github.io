And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case 23STCV16580, a motion to quash service of summons and complaint filed by Specially Appearing Defendant Deeran Demanco Anderson. The defendant argues that the service was defective and that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over him. The plaintiff, Cory Bouthillette, has not filed an opposition to the motion. The court has found that the defendant has provided sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that the information in the proof of service is incorrect. Since the plaintiff has failed to meet his burden to establish the prima facie facts entitling the court to assume jurisdiction, the court grants the motion to quash. The defendant is ordered to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
