Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling in a case where Plaintiffs are seeking to compel Defendant to serve verified responses to discovery requests. The Plaintiffs served Special Interrogatories, Set One and Request for Production, Set Three on June 4, 2024, but Defendant failed to respond. The Plaintiffs then served a Supplemental Pre-Trial Interrogatory on June 17, 2024, and Defendant again failed to respond. The Defendant argues that the motions were not timely filed because Defendant's counsel did not consent to electronic service, but the judge finds that the Defendant does not dispute that the Plaintiffs used the correct email address and therefore the motions were timely filed. The judge grants the Plaintiffs' motions to compel and orders Defendant to serve verified responses within 10 days. The judge also awards Plaintiffs $1,530 in monetary sanctions against Defendant and his counsel of record.
