And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition filed by Arminda Orellana on behalf of Freddy Garcia, a 16-year-old minor. The court denies the petition without prejudice due to several issues with the petition and supporting documents. The court requires the petitioner to provide more information on the settlement terms, including the name of the claimant (Federico Garcia Valencia) and the amount of attorney fees. The court also finds that the attorney fees are not supported by the attorney declaration and requires an English translation of the fee agreement. The court orders the petitioner to give notice and file proof of service.
