And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies Target Corporation's motion to vacate the order deeming requests for admissions admitted under CCP 473(d). The motion was filed after the court granted Plaintiff Nancy Pogue's motion to deem admitted Request for Admissions against Target Corporation. Target Corporation argues that the order is void due to lack of notice, claiming that it did not receive proper notice of the motion. However, the court finds that Target had sufficient notice of the continued hearing dates, as Plaintiff's counsel emailed the new hearing dates to Target's counsel on July 2, 2024, and Target's counsel replied to the email and copied her paralegal. The court also finds that Target has not established that a purported failure to comply with Code of Civil Procedure 1010.6(b)(4) renders a prior order void. Therefore, the court denies Target Corporation's motion and orders the moving party to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
