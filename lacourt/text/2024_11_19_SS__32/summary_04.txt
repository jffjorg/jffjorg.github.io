And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a petition for minors' compromise filed by Petitioner Henry Utama on behalf of Claimant Ian Law, age 16. The petition has been denied without prejudice due to several issues. Firstly, Attachment 10c must contain the terms of the settlement and not the annuity. Secondly, the petition seeks $37,484.58 in attorney fees, which exceeds the 40% fee agreed upon in the fee agreement. The declaration submitted by the Petitioner is insufficient to support the 40% fee sought. The judge has denied the petition without prejudice and has instructed the Petitioner to give notice and file a proof of service of such.
