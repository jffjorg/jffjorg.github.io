[1] The
Court notes that Plaintiff’s opposition was electronically served and filed on
November 8, 2024. The opposition was due November 1, 2024. Nevertheless, the
Court exercises its discretion to consider the late-filed opposition absent
prejudice to Target or a request to continue.


[2] As the
Court previously noted, the paralegal’s declaration did not address the failure
to take action after being copied on the July 2, 2024 email. (See Minute Order
10/15/24.) 


[3] Here,
the issue is not failure to serve altogether. The issue is the failure to serve
multiple people. Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6(b) does not expressly
address this. Section 1010.6(b)(3) provides that the person effecting service
“shall confirm the appropriate electronic service address for the counsel being
served.” Section 1010.6(b)(4) provides that the person shall “electronically
serve the requesting person.” Neither party addresses the proper interpretation
of this language, which by its plain terms does not address multiple service
addresses. Moreover, neither party sufficiently addresses whether a violation
of this statute renders an order “void” for purposes of section 473(d).
