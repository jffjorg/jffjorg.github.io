And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the late-filed opposition from the plaintiff and will take it into account, despite being filed after the deadline. The court notes that the paralegal's declaration did not address the issue of failing to take action after being copied on an email. The main issue is not whether service was made at all, but whether multiple people were served properly. The court is concerned with interpreting Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6(b), which does not explicitly address serving multiple people. The court is also unsure whether a violation of this statute renders an order "void" for purposes of section 473(d).
