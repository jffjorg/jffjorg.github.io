BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff,
the owner of certain real property located at 11116 Balboa Blvd., Granada
Hills, CA 91344, brings this unlawful detainer action against Defendant, the
tenant, to recover possession of the property. Plaintiff alleges that
Defendant’s lease was intended to expire on 6/30/20 without renewal, of which
Plaintiff was given notice. (Compl. ¶¶ 17b, 17d.) However, Defendant remained
in possession of the premises under City and County eviction moratoria created
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, without paying rent or common area
maintenance fees. (Id. at ¶¶ 17b., 17e.) On 5/13/22, after the County
moratorium was lifted, Plaintiff served a 30-day notice to quit on Defendant. (Id.
at ¶ 17c.) Nevertheless, Defendant remained in possession of the property. (Id.
at ¶ 3a.) 
 
On 6/20/22, Plaintiff filed its complaint against
Defendant, alleging a sole cause of action for unlawful detainer, and
requesting forfeiture of the lease agreement, damages, and reasonable attorney
fees. On 7/12/22, Defendant filed a motion to quash service of summons, which
the Court denied on 9/22/22. On 9/27/22, Defendant filed a motion to strike
portions of Plaintiff’s complaint, which the Court denied on 10/21/22.
 
On 12/22/22, the Court denied Defendant’s special
anti-SLAPP motion to strike Plaintiff’s entire complaint. On 1/23/23, Defendant
filed an Appeal thereof. On 7/11/24, the Court of Appeal dismissed Defendant’s
appeal pursuant to her 7/1/24 request for dismissal. 
 
On 8/23/24, Plaintiff filed the instant motion. No
opposition has been filed to date.
 
ANALYSIS
 
An award of
attorney fees is proper when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code
Civ. Proc. §§ 1032, subd. (b); 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).) Here, if the court finds
that a special motion to strike is frivolous or is solely intended to cause
unnecessary delay, the court shall award costs and reasonable attorney’s fees
to a plaintiff prevailing on the motion, pursuant to Section 128.5.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 425.16, subd. (c)(1).) 
 
Here, the
Court previously found that Defendant’s anti-SLAPP motion to strike was “frivolous,
and Plaintiff is entitled to costs and reasonable attorney fees” in the amount
of $1,000. (12/22/22 Min. Order, p. 6.) Based on the foregoing, the Court finds
that the instant motion is authorized by statute.
 
1.     
Attorney Fees Incurred
 
In
determining a reasonable fee award, the Court begins with the lodestar method
of calculation, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate.¿(Karton v. Ari Design & Construction, Inc.
(2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 734, 744; PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22
Cal.4th 1084, 1095–1096.) Here, Plaintiff seeks to recover $29,355.00 in
attorney fees, encompassing 61.80 hours of its attorneys’ time spent with
respect to Defendant’s anti-SLAPP motion and the appeal thereof. (Ex. 5 to
Decl. of Jeffrey B. Endler.) 
 
The Court
notes that Defendant has failed to file any opposition to the instant motion,
and therefore does not challenge the reasonableness of Plaintiff’s attorney
fees incurred. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to recover $29,355.00
in reasonable attorney fees.
 
 
2.     
Costs Incurred
 
Plaintiff
asserts that it incurred costs and expenses totaling $249.86, accounting for
electronic filing fees in connection with Defendant’s anti-SLAPP motion and the
appeal thereof. (Ex. 5 to Decl. of Jeffrey B. Endler.) The Court again notes
that Defendant has failed to oppose the instant motion and challenge the
purported costs incurred by Plaintiff in this action.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The unopposed motion is granted. Plaintiff is awarded $29,604.86
in attorney fees.
