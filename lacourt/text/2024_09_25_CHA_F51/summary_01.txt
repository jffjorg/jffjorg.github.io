The judge finds that the defendant's anti-SLAPP motion to strike was frivolous and intended to cause unnecessary delay, and therefore, the plaintiff is entitled to recover attorney fees and costs. The judge awards the plaintiff $29,604.86 in attorney fees and costs, which includes the costs and expenses incurred by the plaintiff in connection with the defendant's anti-SLAPP motion and the appeal.

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion and awards the plaintiff the requested attorney fees and costs.
