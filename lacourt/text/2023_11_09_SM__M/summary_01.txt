And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to compel answers at deposition filed by Plaintiff Cynthia Wilborn against Defendant John M. Compoginis, M.D. The motion seeks to compel Defendant to answer certain questions about his residence, potential witnesses, and his medical knowledge and training. The judge has reviewed the deposition transcript and finds that Defendant failed to answer questions nos. 1-2, which asked about his residential address and who lives with him. The judge believes that these questions are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and that Defendant has no justification for refusing to answer them. Therefore, the judge will grant the motion as to questions nos. 1-2.

The judge also considered Defendant's objection to question no. 3, which asked about his understanding of the standard of care for plastic surgeons. The judge finds that this question is not permissible because it calls for after-the-fact expert opinions, which Defendant is not authorized to provide. Therefore, the judge will deny the motion as to question no. 3.

Finally, the judge notes that the parties have not noticed any sanctions, and therefore, no sanctions will be granted.
