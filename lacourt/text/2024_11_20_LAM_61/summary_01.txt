And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Fulgent Therapeutics LLC, has moved to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's claims. However, the judge has denied this motion because the arbitration agreement executed by the plaintiff does not apply to PAGA claims, which are the only claims brought in this action. The agreement specifically excludes PAGA claims from arbitration, and the defendant's arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. The judge has determined that the specific terms of the agreement control over broader language regarding representative claims, and therefore, the motion to compel arbitration is denied.
