Kadosh v. Allarie-Larson,
Case No. 20SMCV01208
Hearing Date: June
10, 2024
Defendant’s Motion
to Set Aside Default 
 
Defendant Allarie-Larson
seeks to set aside the default entered on November 02, 2023 in this failure to
pay rent case. Allarie-Larson seeks relief under CCP 473.5, asserting she did
not have notice because she was not served. The court continued the hearing
from 4/23/24 to allow Allarie-Larson to file a supplemental declaration. 
 
Defendant argues
she did not receive notice of summons and complaint and the proof of service
was inaccurate. In considering that public policy favors relief, the court allowed
Allarie-Larson to file a supplemental brief regarding whether she has (1) a
meritorious defense and (2) shown diligence in seeking to set aside the default
once discovered. 04/23/24 Minute Order. In opposition, Kadosh argues Allarie-Larson
has not shown reasonable diligence nor filed a proposed answer. 
 
Allarie-Larson
states she first learned she was being sued in September or October 2020
after receiving notice of a Case Management Conference. Def. decl. ¶2. She
sought legal counsel from the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, but her
efforts were unsuccessful. Id. ¶ 8. On March 1, 2021 she contacted the court
clerk, who informed her the hearing had been canceled, as default judgment had
been entered. Id. Two and a half years later, in November 2023, a friend
informed her she had not been properly served, and she took steps to obtain an
attorney but was unable to find one. Id. ¶ 18d-e.
 
The supplemental
declaration fails to show diligence because Allarie-Larson has not shown she
moved “quickly” to set aside the default once discovered. Rappleyea v.
Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 984. Allarie-Larson’s declaration indicates
more than two years elapsed before she sought relief from default. Default was
entered by the clerk on November 02, 2020. 11/02/20 Request for Entry of
Default. Default judgment was entered on February 17, 2021. 02/17/2021
Judgment. Allarie-Larson states she out about the lawsuit in October 2020. She could
have filed a response or motion to set aside at that time, with no barriers to
filing it on her own. 
 
Allarie-Larson discovered
the default March 1, 2021 and waited two and a half years without an attempt to
set aside the default. Again, nothing prevented her from filing for relief in
pro-per. The court cannot find that she acted with due diligence. As to a
meritorious defense, the opposition is silent on this issue, so the court has
no basis to conclude that there is a meritorious defense. The opposition papers
fail on both issues. Additionally, defendant has not filed a proposed
answer. DENIED.
