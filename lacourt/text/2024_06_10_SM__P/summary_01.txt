And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to set aside the default in the failure to pay rent case. The defendant, Allarie-Larson, seeks relief under CCP 473.5, arguing that she did not receive notice of the summons and complaint, and that the proof of service was inaccurate. However, the court finds that Allarie-Larson failed to show reasonable diligence in seeking to set aside the default. The court notes that Allarie-Larson did not take immediate action to set aside the default after learning of it in March 2021, and instead waited two and a half years to file the motion. The court also finds that Allarie-Larson failed to show a meritorious defense. The motion is denied.
