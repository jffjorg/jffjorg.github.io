Cargill,
et al. v. Greenberg, Glusker, et al., Case No. 23SMCV02152 
Hearing
date June 10, 2024
Defendant
Greenberg Glusker’s Petition to Compel Arbitration - UNOPPOSED
Plaintiffs
allege defendant Greenberg Glusker and Rothstein Law committed legal
malpractice in their representations of plaintiffs in an underlying federal
lawsuit. Greenberg Glusker seeks to compel arbitration based on the arbitration
provision in the engagement agreement. No opposition has been filed. 
Existence
of an Arbitration Agreement
In a motion
to compel arbitration, moving party must prove by a preponderance of evidence
existence of the arbitration agreement and that the dispute is covered by the
agreement. The burden then shifts to the resisting party to prove by a
preponderance of evidence a ground for denial (e.g., fraud, unconscionability,
etc.). Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin. Securities Corp. (1996) 14
Cal.4th 394, 413-414; Hotels Nevada v. L.A. Pacific Center, Inc. (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 754, 758. See also Code of Civ. Proc. §1281.2.
The signed arbitration
agreement, dated May 15, 2020, contains an arbitration provision that states: “By
signing this letter, you agree … and we agree that, in the event of any dispute
arising out of or relating to this agreement, our relationship, or the services
performed (including but not limited to disputes regarding fees or costs,
claims of negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud or any claim based upon a
statute or rule), such dispute shall be resolved by submission to binding arbitration….”
Steinberg Decl., Exh. 3 at pg. 7.
Greenberg Glusker
contends the arbitration agreement covers the subject dispute because the
claims arise from the legal representation in the underlying federal action. The
arbitration provision covers “any dispute arising out of or relating to this
agreement, our relationship, or the services performed…”  Steinberg Decl, Exh. 3 at pg. 7. 
The
arbitration provision covers all alleged conduct. The petition is unopposed and
is GRANTED.
