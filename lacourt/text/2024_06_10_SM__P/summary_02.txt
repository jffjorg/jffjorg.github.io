And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the petition to compel arbitration filed by Greenberg Glusker, as the petition is unopposed. The dispute arises from the legal representation in the underlying federal action, and the arbitration provision in the engagement agreement covers all alleged conduct. The burden is on the moving party to prove the existence of the arbitration agreement and that the dispute is covered by the agreement, and the resisting party must prove a ground for denial. In this case, the arbitration agreement exists and covers the subject dispute.
