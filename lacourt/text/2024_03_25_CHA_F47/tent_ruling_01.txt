SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arose out of Plaintiff Janet Louise Wilkes,
Trustee of the Janet Louise Wilkes Living Trust (Plaintiff) and Defendant Gary
William Wilkes’ (Defendant) ownership of real property commonly known as
17622-17624 Los Alimos Street, Los Angeles, California (APN 2712-028-008) (the
Property) as co-tenants.  In 2022, the
parties began discussions to end their joint ownership of the property.  When they could not agree as to the purchase
price, on 7/12/22, Plaintiff filed this action for partition of the property. 
 
On 2/2/24, the Court entered its order granting
Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment for partition by sale of the Property.  On 2/21/24, the Court granted interlocutory
judgment for partition by sale explaining that a hearing on the appointment of
a partition referee to manage the sale of the Property be set for 3/25/24, with
briefing according to code.  Plaintiff
attempted to meet and confer with Defendant’s counsel and proposed Matthew L.
Taylor (Taylor) as the referee. 
(Gonzalez Decl.).  However, Defendant
refused to engage in the meet and confer process.  Id. 

 
Therefore, pursuant to the Court’s order, on 2/28/24, Plaintiff
filed and served the instant motion seeking an order appointing a referee and
to clarify the referee’s duties to sell the Property in accordance with the
2/21/24 Interlocutory Judgment and CCP 873.010, et seq.  Defendant has not opposed or otherwise
responded to the motion.
 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
A court may appoint a referee to sell property.  See CCP 873.010.  The referee may not be: (1) a clerk or deputy
of the clerk; (2) a former or present partner or employee of the judge; (3) a
relative within the third degree of the judge or the judge’s spouse or the
spouse of such a relative; or (4) an owner of any interest that is the subject
of the action.  CCP 873.050.  
 
The Court finds that Taylor is qualified to act as
partition referee in this matter.  (See
Taylor Decl.).  Additionally, the Court
finds that the instructions set forth in the proposed Order are appropriate in
this matter.  See CCP
873.010(b)(2); CCP 873.060; CCP 873.070.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted.
