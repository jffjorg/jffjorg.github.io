And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The motion filed by the Plaintiff, Janet Louise Wilkes, Trustee of the Janet Louise Wilkes Living Trust, to appoint a partition referee to sell the subject real property (APN 2712-028-008) is granted. The property was previously owned by the Plaintiff and Defendant, Gary William Wilkes, as co-tenants, but they were unable to agree on the purchase price, leading to the filing of the partition action. The Court previously granted summary judgment for partition by sale and interlocutory judgment for partition by sale. The Plaintiff proposed Matthew L. Taylor as the referee, but the Defendant refused to engage in the meet and confer process. As a result, the Plaintiff filed the instant motion seeking an order appointing a referee and clarifying the referee's duties to sell the property in accordance with the interlocutory judgment and CCP 873.010, et seq. The Court finds that Taylor is qualified to act as partition referee and that the instructions set forth in the proposed Order are appropriate in this matter.
