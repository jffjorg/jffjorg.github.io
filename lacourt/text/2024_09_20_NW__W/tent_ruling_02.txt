BACKGROUND
 
On August 3, 2022, Plaintiff Tannette
Gates filed a complaint against Warner Center Condominiums, Ross Morgan &
Company, Inc., Amber Hill, Valerie Vincent, Joanne Catran, Mimi Himes, Afsaneh
Safaei, Arash Safaei, and Hippo Analytics, Inc. for damages arising out of a
kitchen pipe exploding in the unit upstairs and water from the upstairs unit
damaging Plaintiffs. On January 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint
asserting causses of action for: (1) Breach of CCRs; (2) Enforcement of
Equitable Servitudes; (3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (4) Nuisance; (5)
Negligence; (6) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (7) Breach of
Contract and Implied Covenant of Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (8)
Third-Party Beneficiary Breach of Contract; (9) Professional Negligence and
(Negligent Misrepresentation (10) Violation of Business and Professional Code §
17200; (11) Declaratory Relief; and (12) Unjust Enrichment against. Plaintiff
also named Topa Insurance Company as a defendant. On November 30, 2023,
Plaintiff named Chetan Chandrakant Rane as Doe 1. 
 
On January 30, 2023, Plaintiff
dismissed Amber Hill, Valerie Vincent, Joanne Catran, and Mimi Himes. 
 
Plaintiff filed a Second Amended
Complaint on May 11, 2023. On September 7, 2023, Plaintiff dismissed Hippo
Analytics, Inc. Plaintiff has now filed a Third Amended Complaint as of January
4, 2024. The Third Amended Complaint did not include Chetan Chandrakant Rane. On
January 9, 2024, Plaintiff named Abidya Bahl as Doe 2. 
 
Request for entry of default was
entered against Afsaneh Safaei and Arash Safaei on September 28, 2022. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Defendant
Afsaneh Safaei’s Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Entry of Default is GRANTED. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendant
Afsaneh Safaei moves the court or an order setting aside/vacating the default
entered against Defendant on September 28, 2022 on the grounds: (1) the default
was improperly entered as Plaintiff failed to serve any statement of damages on
Defendant (CCP §473(d); (2) California Rules of Court, Rule 3.110(h); (3) when
a complaint is substantively amended after default is entered against a
defendant, the amendment “opens” the default (Ford v. Superior Court
(1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 338, 342-43); (4) that the default was taken by reason of
mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect (CCP §473(b); and (5) the
inherent equitable power of the Court. 
 
I.                   
Improper Service
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 473(d) provides that “[t]he court may . . . on motion of
either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or
order.” (CCP §473(d).) A default judgment is void against a defendant who was
not served with a summons in the manner prescribed by statute. (See Sakaguchi
v. Sakaguchi (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 852, 858.) Relief pursuant to section
473(d) may be made at any time. (See Manson, Iver & York v. Black
(2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 36, 42.)  
 
Defendant
argues Code of Civil Procedure section 425.11 provides in part that, before a
default may be taken in an action to recover damages for personal injury
against a non-appearing defendant, the plaintiff must serve the non-appearing
defendant with a statement of damages in the same manner as a summons. (CCP §
425.11, (b), (c) & (d).) This requirement was “designed to give defendants
one last clear chance to respond to allegations of complaints by providing them
with actual notice of their exact potential liability.” (Lopez v. Fancelli
(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 1305, 1310.) Defendant contends Section 425.11 is
applicable to this action because Plaintiff’s causes of action for Nuisance,
Negligence, and Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress alleged against
Defendant in the original Complaint apparently seek to recover damages for
Plaintiff’s alleged personal injuries. As a result, Plaintiff was to serve
Defendant with a Statement of Damages. 
 
In
opposition, Plaintiff argues this is not an action that involves personal
injury or death. Moreover, Section 425.11(b) states that the defendant may
request a statement of damages from Plaintiff. However, Defendant Afsaneh’s
counsel did not and refused to contact Plaintiff by phone or otherwise, until
instructed by this court to do so. 
 
Regardless of
whether Section 425.11 is applicable to the facts at hand, the court agrees
that the complaint failed to allege the amount of damages and Defendant did not
receive the Statement of Damages. Therefore, Defendant did not receive adequate
notice of the specific relief sought against Defendant before default was
entered. Since relief pursuant to Section 473(d) can be made at any time, the
court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to set aside the request for default. 
 
The court
will briefly discuss Defendant’s other contentions below. 
 
II.                 
California
Rules of Court, Rule 3.110
 
Defendant
argues that they must be relieved from default because Plaintiff failed to
obtain a default judgment within 45 days of the entry of default pursuant to
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.110(h). Specifically, Plaintiff never sought
to obtain a default judgment against Defendant, let alone within 45 days after
default was entered. 
 
In
opposition, Plaintiff argues this argument fails because Defendant’s own motion
to set aside the default is untimely. The court finds Rule 3.110(h) is not
grounds to set aside the request for entry of default. Rather, the failure to
obtain a default judgment within 45 days should have resulted in the issuance
of an OSC re dismissal. 
 
III.               
Amended
Pleadings
 
Defendant
next argues because Plaintiff made substantial additions and changes to the
nature of their complaint, the filing of the FAC “opened” the default entered
against Defendant and waived Plaintiff’s right, if any, to obtain judgment on
the default. (See Ford v. Superior Court (1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 338, 342.)

 
In
opposition, Plaintiff argues none of the amendments to Plaintiff’s Second
Amended Complaint relate to Afsaneh or any causes of action against Afsaneh. 
 
Default was
entered against Defendant on the original complaint. Against Afsaneh, Plaintiff
alleged breach of CC&Rs, Enforcement of Equitable Servitude, Nuisance,
Negligence, Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress, and Declaratory Relief.
In the Second Amended Complaint, which was filed after default was obtained,
Plaintiff added a cause of action for Unjust Enrichment against Defendant
Afsaneh. Moreover, the SAC contained more allegations against Defendant Afsaneh
including that she engaged in conduct that created loud obnoxious noises. (SAC
¶21.) 
 
Accordingly,
such an amended did “open” the default and give Defendant Afsaneh another
opportunity to respond. (See Sass v. Cohen (2020) 10 Cal.5th 861, 880.)
This is not like the distinction in Cole since no judgment has been
obtained. 
 
IV.              
Code of Civil
Procedure 473(b)
 
Defendant
argues the default should be set aside due to mistake. Specifically,
Defendant’s new counsel was never notified from prior counsel of the default
and instead told that the FAC was erroneously filed and that further amendments
were forthcoming. After being made aware of the default on January 22, 2024,
Defendant’s counsel promptly, yet unsuccessfully, sought to meet and confer
with Plaintiff to set aside the default. 
 
The motion is
untimely under Section 473(b). Under Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b),
defendants are required to bring any motion to vacate a default judgment within
six months of its entry.
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant Afsaneh Safaei’s Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Entry of
Default is GRANTED.
