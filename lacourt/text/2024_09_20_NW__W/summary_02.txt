And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted defendant Afsaneh Safaei's motion to set aside the default entered against her. The judge found that the default was improperly entered because the plaintiff failed to serve Afsaneh Safaei with a statement of damages, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.11. Additionally, the judge found that the complaint failed to allege the amount of damages, which is a necessary element of a valid default judgment. The judge also took into account the fact that Afsaneh Safaei's new counsel was not notified of the default and that the plaintiff made substantial changes to the complaint, which "opened" the default and gave Afsaneh Safaei another opportunity to respond. The judge found that these circumstances constituted a mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, which is a ground for setting aside a default judgment under California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b).
