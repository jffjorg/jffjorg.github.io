Defendants West Hills Hospital and Medical Center, Jonathan S. Matthew, M.D.,
Jamshid Nazarian, M.D., and Laurance J. Friedman, M.D. for medical malpractice.
Plaintiff alleges on December 10, 2016, Plaintiff underwent an

assistance of Dr. Laurence Friedman. However, the procedure fell below the
standard of care. Plaintiff further alleges on January 23, 2020, she was seen
by Dr. Li for what appeared to be multiple adhesions. Plaintiff alleges and
believes that the foreign bodies were left there from the esophagogastroduodenoscopy
procedure. Plaintiff named John J. Li, M.D. as Doe 1 on January 30, 2024. 
 
Plaintiff dismissed Defendant Jamshid Nazarian, M.D.
on November 29, 2023. The court dismissed Defendant Laurence J. Friedman, M.D. On
August 8, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed John J. Li, M.D. Summary Judgment was

DISCUSSION
 
Defendant West Hills Hospital and Medical Center moves
the court for an order compelling Plaintiff Maria De La Cruz Bravo Fernandez to
provide full and complete, verified responses to Defendant’s Form
Interrogatories, Set One; Request for Production, Set One; and Special
Interrogatories, Set One, all without objections. Defendant also seeks
Plaintiff and/or her counsel of record to pay monetary sanctions for reasonable
expenses and attorney fees incurred by Defendant having to bring these motions.

 
Where a party fails to serve timely responses to
discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (CCP §§
2030.290, 2031.300, 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails
to serve a timely response to the discovery request waives any objection to the
request, including one based on privilege or the protection of attorney work
product. (CCP §§2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.) Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may also move for an order
that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in
the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. (CCP §
2033.280(b).)
 
On February 27, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiff with
Defendant’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One,
and Request for Production, Set One. (Paggabao Decl. ¶4, Exh. A.) Plaintiff’s
responses were due by April 2, 2024. (Paggabao Decl. ¶5.) Counsel met and
conferred with Plaintiff’s counsel regarding the overdue discovery responses.
(Paggabao Decl. ¶6, Exh. B.) Plaintiff’s counsel confirmed they had ten days to
provide responses. (Paggabao Decl. ¶7, Exh. C.) By June 14, 2024, Defendant
still had not received responses to any discovery. (Paggabao Decl. ¶8.)
Defendant notified Plaintiff of the overdue responses on June 24, 2024 and July
2, 2024 (Paggabao Decl. ¶¶8, 9, Exh. D, E.) On July 8, 2024, Plaintiffs counsel
contacted Defendant's counsel and asked to extend the due date to July 11,
2024, to which Defendant's counsel agreed. (Paggabao Decl. ¶10, Exh. E.) To
date, Plaintiff has failed to serve any objections or responses to the
discovery requests. (Paggabao Decl. ¶11.) 
 
Based on the foregoing,
Defendant West Hills
Hospital and Medical Center’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff Maria De La Cruz Bravo
Fernandez’s Responses to Defendant’s Request for Production, Set One; Motion to
Compel Plaintiff Maria De La Cruz Bravo Fernandez’s Responses to Defendant’s
Form Interrogatories, Set One; and Motion to Compel Plaintiff Maria De La Cruz
Bravo Fernandez’s Responses to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Set One are GRANTED. 
 
Plaintiff is ordered to
produce responses, without objection, within 20 days. 
 
Sanctions 
 
Defendant seeks $1,297.50
in monetary sanctions per motion. If a propounding party moves for and obtains
a court order compelling a response, the court shall impose monetary sanctions
against the party failing to timely respond to interrogatories and demands for
inspection unless that party acted with substantial justification or the
sanction would otherwise be unjust. (CCP §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c),
2033.280(c); Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.) 
 
The court GRANTS the request for monetary sanctions in
the reduced amount of $847.50 for the first motion and $285.00 each for the
other two motions. The court finds the motions were largely identical and only
one appearance fee necessary.
