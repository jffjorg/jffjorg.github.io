And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a petition for approval of a compromise of minors' settlement in the case of Jorge Huitron, et al v. Derrick Cabrera, City of Hawthorne. The plaintiffs, Jenny Oliden and her twin daughters, Audrey and Scarlett Huitron, were involved in an incident on March 21, 2016, in which a police cruiser struck their vehicle, resulting in premature birth and traumatic brain injury. The parties have reached a global settlement agreement for $11,400,000, with each claimant receiving a share of the amount. The judge is reviewing the proposed distribution of the settlement, including attorney's fees and costs, and is inclined to approve the terms of the settlement. However, the judge notes that the settlement involves a transfer to a trust, which must be reviewed by the Probate Division. Therefore, the judge continues the hearing to February 9, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton Courthouse.
