```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Linda Love's motion for sanctions against Plaintiff De’Wone Howard. The motion was filed under California Civil Procedure Code § 128.5, which allows for sanctions against a party who files a frivolous lawsuit or engages in bad faith tactics. The Judge found that Defendant failed to comply with the 21-day "safe harbor" provision, which requires the moving party to serve the offending party with a motion for sanctions 21 days before filing it. As a result, the motion is denied. The dispute centers around the validity of the complaint filed by Plaintiff, which Defendant alleges was frivolous and filed solely to prevent Defendant from selling the property and to extort a financial settlement. The Judge notes that Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the action, but Defendant has the right to seek costs after dismissal.
