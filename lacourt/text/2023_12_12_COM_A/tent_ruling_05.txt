[TENTATIVE] ORDER CONTINUING THE HEARING ON TWO PETITIONS
FOR APPROVAL OF COMPROMISE OF MINORS’ SETTLEMENT
 
      The
complaint filed on April 3, 2017, alleges that Plaintiffs sustained injury on March
21, 2016, when Defendants’ police cruiser struck Plaintiffs’ vehicle.
Plaintiff, Jenny Oliden, was pregnant at the time of the incident. The twin
Plaintiffs, Audrey Huitron and Scarlett Huitron, were born prematurely, five
days after the incident. 
      Petitioner
is Plaintiff, Jenny Oliden, the mother, and Guardian ad Litem of the minor
claimant who seeks approval of the Plaintiffs’ settlement, as shown below. (CA
R LOS ANGELES SUPER CT Rule 4.115.) The parties globally settled the claims
for $11,400,000 to be distributed as follows:



Jenny Oliden,
  Mother


$1,400,000.00




Audrey Oliden,
  Claimant


5,000,000.00




Scarlett
  Huitron, Claimant


5,000,000.00




TOTAL
  SETTLEMENT


$11,400,000.00



 
      Both
claimants suffered traumatic brain injury as a result of the incident,
resulting cognitive and speech delays. 
      Each claimants’
medical expenses were reduced from $481,616.84 for Scarlett and $572,845.04 for
Audrey. The following expenses will be reimbursed to the medical care providers
according to their letter agreements to accept a reduced lien amount. Decl of
John J. Rice, Lien Negotiator. 



Bakersfield Family
  Medical Group (Scarlett)


$20,000.00




Bakersfield Family
  Medical Group (Audrey


$20,000.00



 
      Plaintiff’s
counsel requests attorney’s fees totaling $1,750,000, which is 35 percent of
each minor claimant’s recovery. (Cal.
Rules of Court, 7.955.) In determining a reasonable fee, the court may consider
the following non-exclusive factors: the fact that a person with a disability
is involved and that person’s circumstances; the amount of the fee in
proportion to the value of the services performed; the novelty and difficulty
of the questions involved and the skill required; the amount involved and the
results obtained; the experience, reputation, and ability of counsel and the
attorney’s relative sophistication. If the fee is contingent, the court
considers the risk of loss borne by counsel, the amount of costs advanced, and
the delay in payment of fees and obtaining reimbursement for costs. (Cal.
Rules of Court, 7.955 subd. (b).)
      The
Court has considered the declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel, Gregory Rizio, who
took this case on a contingency fee basis and who advanced costs. He attests to
the case’s difficulty and complexity, specifically in establishing that the
Claimants’ injuries were caused by Defendants, and establishing whether
Claimants’ mother should have been on bed rest at the time of the incident. The
Court finds the fee request is reasonable under all the circumstances. 
      The
Court has reviewed the billing records of counsel for costs incurred in
litigating this matter. Costs incurred exclusively on behalf of the minor
Claimants were divided equally. Otherwise, counsel allocated 1/3 of the
remaining costs between the three Plaintiffs. Accordingly, the distribution of
the gross settlement amount for each Claimant is as follows:



Gross Settlement


 


$5,000,000.00




Medical expenses


$20,000.00


$20,000.00




Attorney’s fees 


1,750,000.00


1,750,000.00




Attorney’s costs


265,919.17


265,919.17




<Total costs>


 


-$2,035,919.17




Net settlement for
  each Claimant


 


$2,964,080.83



 
      For
each Claimant, the Guardian ad Litem proposes to use $2,500,000 from each
Claimant’s net settlement to fund a single-premium deferred annuity for their
benefit. The balance of $464,080.83 will be transferred to a trust created for
each Claimant. 
      Because
the settlement involves a transfer to a trust, the Probate Division must review
the trust terms. (CA
R LOS ANGELES SUPER CT Rule 4.115.)  Petitioner
must lodge with the filing window of the Probate Division at Stanley Mosk
Courthouse at least 30 days before the hearing a physical copy of the face page
of the petition to approve the compromise and attach a copy of the proposed
trust instrument and the proposed order approving the compromise and trust. (Id.)

      Accordingly, while the Court is
inclined to approve the terms of settlement, an order cannot be submitted
without the Probate Division’s review. Accordingly, the Court continues the
hearing on this Petition to February 9, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton
Courthouse. Plaintiff is ordered to comply with Local Rule 4.115.
