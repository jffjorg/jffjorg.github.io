5.     Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further
Responses to RFP 
Meet and Confer
On November 15, 2024, the parties met with the Court for an IDC
regarding the instant motion, and after discussion the Court deemed the issues
unresolved.  (11/15/24 Minute Order.)
 
Discussion
Having reviewed Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses from Defendant
to his RFP, the Court rules as follows:
          On January 31, 2024, Plaintiff
propounded RFP on Defendant.  (Decl. of Nielsen
¶4.)  On April 2, 2024, after a 30-day extension,
Defendant provided incomplete discovery responses.  (Decl. of Nielsen ¶5.)  Plaintiff now moves to compel further responses.  
          Plaintiff’s motion to
compel further Code-compliant responses from Defendant to RFP Request Nos. 2-3
is denied.  
RFP Request No. 2 states: “Produce all Documents that support any of
Your contentions in response to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories – General -
Set One, served concurrently herewith.” 
(MTCF RFP SS, pg. 2.)
          Defendant’s objection to
Request No. 2 is well taken.  The request
is unintelligible as to the phrase “Your Contentions.”  Request No. 2 seeks all documents supporting Defendant’s
contentions in response to Form Interrogatories.  Plaintiff fails to define the term
“contentions,” it is unclear what Plaintiff is referring to with the statement
“your contentions” in response to Form Interrogatories.
          RFP Request No. 3 states:
“Without individually identifying any claimant other than Plaintiff, or
providing any other constitutionally or statutorily protected information,
produce each and every claim denial letter for each and every claim for
property damage under any automobile insurance policy that You issued to any
Person Related to wind, sand, or dust damage occurring on May 28, 2022 in Riverside
County, including, without limitation, in zip codes 92201, 92203, 92211, 92234,
92236, 92270, or 92276, for which You denied coverage.”  (MTCF RFP SS, pg. 3.)
          Defendant’s objection to
Request No. 3 is well taken.  The only
instances when documents related to other insureds may be relevant and
discoverable is when the insured alleges the insurer’s acts “were engaged in
with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice.”  (Colonial Life & Accident Insurance Co.
v. Superior Court (1982) 31 Cal.3d 785, 791.)  In such instances, “[d]iscovery aimed at
determining the frequency of alleged unfair settlement practices is . . .
likely to produce evidence directly relevant to the action.”  (Id.)  Here, Plaintiff makes no such allegations that
Defendant acted in a “pattern and practice” of wrongfully investigating and
denying property damage claims like Plaintiff’s claim.  The request is therefore not relevant to
Plaintiff’s claims.  
Further, even in instances where “pattern and practice” discovery may be
warranted, courts limit the discoverability of information related to other
insureds to those claims handled by a single adjuster.  (Id. at pg. 789.)  Additionally, before allowing the
discoverability of such information, courts require that the other insureds
respond to a court-approved letter before the propounding party can obtain the
information and/or documents to preserve the insured’s privacy rights and
confidentiality.  (Id. at pg. 794 [“The
court barred plaintiff’s counsel from contacting other claimants until those
claimants responded to a court-approved letter. In addition, the court’s
November 9 protective order barred plaintiff’s attorney from disclosing or
publishing [the information], and from ‘making any use thereof except for
preparation for trial and trial in this action.’”].)
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $788.00 against Defendant.  As a preliminary matter, Plaintiff fails to
provide notice to Defendant of the statute under which it moves for sanctions,
thereby depriving Defendant of due process. 
Therefore, the Court declines to award Plaintiff’s request for monetary
sanctions.
Defendant, in its opposition, requests monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff and/or his counsel of record in the amount of $1,040.00 pursuant to
C.C.P. §2023.010(c) and 2031.310(h) for having to oppose the instant
motion.  (Notice Opposition MTCF RFP, pg.
2.) 
          The Court declines to award
sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel pursuant to C.C.P. §2031.310(h) in
the amount of $1,040.00, on the basis Defendant’s counsel failed to file a
declaration in support of her request for sanctions on this opposition;
Defendant appears to have filed its memorandum of points and authorities twice
instead of filing Moutes-Lee’s declaration for this motion.  Therefore, Defendant’s request for sanctions
is denied.
Moving Party is to give notice of this ruling. 
 
6.     Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further
Responses to FROG 
Meet and Confer
On November 15, 2024, the parties met with the Court for an IDC
regarding the instant motion, and after discussion the Court deemed the issues
unresolved.  (11/15/24 Minute Order.)
 
Discussion
Having reviewed Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses from
Defendant to his FROG, the Court rules as follows:
          On January 31, 2024,
Plaintiff served FROG on Defendant. 
(Decl. of Nielsen ¶4.)  On April 2, 2024, after a 30-day extension,
Defendant provided incomplete discovery responses.  (Decl. of Nielsen ¶5.)  Plaintiff now moves to compel further responses.
          Plaintiff’s motion to
compel further Code-compliant responses from Defendant to FROG Request Nos. 12.1,
12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 12.6, 12.7, 13.1,
13.2, 14.1, 16.1, 16.7, 16.8, and 50.2 is granted.  Defendant is ordered to provide further Code-compliant
responses to FROG within 20 days of this ruling.
Defendant’s objections to Plaintiff’s requests on the basis the term “INCIDENT”
was not specifically defined is unavailing. 
Defendant can apply a reasonable interpretation to the interrogatories
with respect to Plaintiff’s cause of action for breach of contract.  Further, Defendant’s objections on the basis
of “attorney-client privilege, attorney work product doctrine, and/or
litigation privilege” is not a sufficient ground for an objection; a privilege
log must identify with particularity each document it claims is protected from
disclosure and provide sufficient factual information for the propounding party
and court to evaluate whether the claim has merit.  (E.g., Catalina Island Yacht Club v.
Superior Court (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1130, citing C.C.P. §§2031.240(b),
(c).)  Defendant’s notation on the
privilege log does not list any documents withheld on the grounds of “attorney-client
privilege, attorney work product doctrine, and/or litigation privilege” and
only specifies that it has withheld or redacted documents that are “[i]rrelevant;
confidential; proprietary.”  (Decl. of
Nielsen ¶¶16-17, Exh. B.)  The
description of “Claim activity re SFI Invoice” is not sufficient factual
information for this Court to evaluate whether Defendant’s position has merit.
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $518.00 against
Defendant.  As a preliminary matter,
Plaintiff fails to provide notice to Defendant of the statute under which it
moves for sanctions, thereby depriving Defendant of due process.  Therefore, the Court declines to award
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.
Defendant, in its opposition, requests monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff and/or his counsel of record in the amount of $1,040.00 pursuant to
C.C.P. §2023.010(c) and 2030.300(d) for having to oppose the instant
motion.  (Notice Opposition MTCF FROG,
pg. 2.) 
          In light of the Court’s
ruling on this motion, the Court declines to award sanctions against Plaintiff
and his counsel.
Moving Party is to give notice of this ruling. 
 
7.     Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further
Responses to SROG 
Meet and Confer
On November 15, 2024, the parties met with the Court for an IDC
regarding the instant motion, and after discussion the Court deemed the issues
unresolved.  (11/15/24 Minute Order.)
 
Discussion
Having reviewed Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses from
Defendant to his SROG, the Court rules as follows:
          On January 31, 2024,
Plaintiff served SROG on Defendant. 
(Decl. of Nielsen ¶4.)  On April 2, 2024, after a 30-day extension,
Defendant provided incomplete discovery responses.  (Decl. of Nielsen ¶5.)  Plaintiff now moves to compel further responses.
          Plaintiff’s motion to
compel further Code-compliant responses from Defendant to SROG Request Nos. 1-5
is denied.
SROG Request No. 1 states: “Without individually identifying any
claimant other than Plaintiff, or providing any other constitutionally or
statutorily protected information, state the number of claims for property
damage that You received, under any automobile insurance policy that You issued
to any Person, that Relate to wind, sand, or dust damage occurring on May 28,
2022, in Riverside County, including, without limitation, in zip codes 92201,
92203, 92211, 92234, 92236, 92270, or 92276.” 
(MTCF SROG SS, pg. 2.)
SROG Request No. 2 states: “Without individually identifying any
claimant other than Plaintiff, or providing any other constitutionally or
statutorily protected information, state the number of claims for property
damage under any automobile insurance policy that You issued to any Person
Related to wind, sand, or dust damage occurring on May 28, 2022, in Riverside
County, including, without limitation, in zip codes 92201, 92203, 92211, 92234,
92236, 92270, or 92276, for which You denied coverage.”  (MTCF SROG SS, pg. 3.)
SROG Request No. 3 states: “Without individually identifying any
claimant, or providing any other constitutionally or statutorily protected
information, state the number of claims for property damage under any automobile
insurance policy that You issued to any Person, Related to wind, sand, or dust
damage occurring on May 28, 2022 in Riverside County, including, without
limitation, in zip codes 92201, 92203, 92211, 92234, 92236, 92270, or 92276,
under which You tendered any payment for repairs.”  (MTCF SROG SS, pgs. 3-4.)
SROG Request No. 4 states: “Without individually identifying any
claimant, or providing any other constitutionally or statutorily protected
information, for each and every claim for property damage under any automobile insurance
policy that You issued to any Person, Related to wind, sand, or dust damage
occurring on May 28, 2022 in Riverside County, including, without limitation,
in zip codes 92201, 92203, 92211, 92234, 92236, 92270, or 92276, under which
You tendered any payment for repairs, state the total payment tendered with
respect to each such claim.”  (MTCF SROG
SS, pg. 6.)
SROG Request No. 5 states: “Without individually identifying any
claimant, or providing any other constitutionally or statutorily protected
information, for each and every claim for property damage under any automobile insurance
policy that You issued to any Person, Related to wind, sand, or dust damage
occurring on May 28, 2022 in Riverside County, including, without limitation,
in zip codes 92201, 92203, 92211, 92234, 92236, 92270, or 92276, under which
You tendered any payment for repairs, state the claim number of each such
claim.”  (MTCF SROG SS, pg. 7.)
          Defendant’s objection to
Request Nos. 1-5 are well taken.  The
only instances when information related to other insureds may be relevant and
discoverable is when the insured alleges the insurer’s acts “were engaged in
with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice.”  (Colonial Life & Accident Insurance Co.,
31 Cal.3d at pg. 791.)  In such
instances, “[d]iscovery aimed at determining the frequency of alleged unfair
settlement practices is . . . likely to produce evidence directly relevant to
the action.”  (Id.)  Here, Plaintiff makes no such allegations that
Defendant acted in a “pattern and practice” of wrongfully investigating and

Plaintiff’s claims.  
Further, even in instances where “pattern and practice” discovery may be

discoverability of such information, courts require that the other insureds
respond to a court-approved letter before the propounding party can obtain the
information and/or documents to preserve the insured’s privacy rights and
confidentiality.  (Id. at pg. 794.)
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,633.00 against
Defendant.  As a preliminary matter,
Plaintiff fails to provide notice to Defendant of the statute under which it
moves for sanctions, thereby depriving Defendant of due process.  Further, in light of the instant motion, the
Court declines to award Plaintiff sanctions.  Therefore, Plaintiff’s request for monetary
sanctions is denied.
Defendant, in its opposition, requests monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff and/or his counsel of record in the amount of $1,040.00 pursuant to
C.C.P. §2023.010(c) and 2030.300(d) for having to oppose the instant
motion.  (Notice Opposition MTCF SROG,
pg. 2.) 
The Court grants Defendant’s request for sanctions against Plaintiff
and/or his counsel of record, Champion Law Firm, jointly and severally,
pursuant to C.C.P. §2023.010(c) and 2030.300(d), in the reduced amount of $520.00,
calculated as follows:
$260/hour x 2.0 to draft opposition = $520.00
          Sanctions are due within
20 days of this ruling.
