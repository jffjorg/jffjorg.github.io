 Case No.: 
  24STCV06736
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 4, 2024



 
Defendant
Lida Mirzakhanian’s, individually and as trustee of the Lida Mirzakhanian
Living Trust UTD 9/15/2021, demurrer to Plaintiff Alexander Margarian’s first
amended complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
          Defendant
Lida Mirzakhanian, individually and as trustee of the Lida Mirzakhanian Living
Trust UTD 9/15/2021 (“Mirzakhanian”) (collectively, “Defendant”) demurs to
Plaintiff Alexander Margarian’s (“Margarian”) (“Plaintiff”) first amended
complaint (“FAC”) on the grounds the FAC fails to state facts sufficient to
allege causes of action; is uncertain; and fails to identify the terms of the
contract and whether it is oral, written, or implied by conduct.  (Notice of Demurrer; C.C.P. §430.10(e).)[1]
 
Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer, the
moving party must meet and confer in person, by
telephone, or by video conference with the party who
filed the pleading to attempt to reach an agreement that would resolve the objections
to the pleading and obviate the need for filing the demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41, emphasis added.) 
Defendant’s counsel’s declaration
states that on September 9, 2024, he “conferred by electronic mail with
Plaintiff’s Counsel to determine whether a resolution can be reached that would
resolve the issues to be raised in Defendants’ demurrer. On September 13, 2024,
Plaintiff’s Counsel responded via electronic mail providing responses in
opposition to the issues to be raised in Defendants’ demurrer and made it exceedingly
clear that a resolution could be reached without the filing of Defendants’
demurrer.”  (Decl. of Jawlakian.)
Defendant’s counsel’s declaration
is in violation of numerous statutes, the first being C.C.P. §2015.5, that his
declaration is not certified under penalty of perjury that his attestation is
true and correct.  Second, Defendant’s
counsel’s meet and confer declaration is in violation of C.C.P. §430.41 because
he does not state he attempted to meet and confer in person, by telephone,
or by video conference.  However, failure
to sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a)(4); Dumas
v. Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 348, 355; Olson
v. Hornbrook Community Services District (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 502, 515.)  Accordingly, the Court will consider
Defendant’ demurrer.
The Court notes that it has the
discretion to continue the hearing, or take the motion off calendar, and order
a conference pursuant to C.C.P. §430.41(c) before ruling on a demurrer where
(1) the demurring party failed to file a declaration reporting on the meet and
confer, or (2) the other party refused to meet or failed to meet in good faith.
 A party’s violation of C.C.P. §430.41
might draw C.C.P. §128.5 sanctions.  Continued
violations of the meet and confer requirement may result in future consequences
to Defendant.
 
          Background
          Plaintiff
filed his initial complaint on March 18, 2024, against Defendant alleging two
causes of action: (1) specific performance; and (2) damages.  
          On July 24,
2024, this Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to the Complaint with 20 days
leave to amend.  (See 7/24/24
Minute Order.)
          On August 19,
2024, Plaintiff file the operative FAC for the same two causes of action.  Plaintiff’s causes of action arise from his
July 19, 2024, offer to purchase 1907 Alpha Rd., Glendale California 91208
(“Subject Property”) owned by Defendant for $2,400,000 pursuant to the terms
and conditions of the California Residential Purchase Agreement and Joint
Escrow Instructions (“Plaintiff’s Offer”). 
(See FAC ¶5, Exh. 2.)
          Defendant
filed the instant demurrer on September 19, 2024.  Plaintiff filed his opposition on November 15,
2024.  As of the date of this hearing no
reply has been filed.
 
Summary of
Demurrer
Defendant demurs
to the FAC, and the 1st and 2nd causes of action on the basis they fail to
state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action and are uncertain.  (Demurrer.)
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a
complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385,
388.)  A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Insurance Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider
declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted
for the truth of their contents].)  For
purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed
to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of
law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital
District (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Failure to State
a Claim
Entire FAC
A cause of action
for breach of contract for specific performance requires the following
elements: (1) Contract breach; (2) inadequacy of a legal remedy; (3) underlying
contract reasonable and supported by adequate consideration; (4) existence of a
mutuality of remedies; (5) contractual terms sufficiently definite to know what
it is to enforce; and (6) substantial similarity between requested performance
and promised performance.  (Real Estate Analytics, LLC v. Vallas
(2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 463, 472; see also Patel v. Liebermensch (2008) 45 Cal.4th 344, 349 [stating if
contract terms are certain enough, judges carry into effect ascertainable,
reasonable intentions of the parties]; Mansouri
v. Superior Court (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 633, 642 [“elements of a cause of
action for specific performance of a contract include not only the contract . .
. , but defendant’s breach of the contract.”].)  (But see Union Oil Co. of California v. Greka Energy Corp. (2008) 165
Cal.App.4th 129, 134 [“‘Specific performance . . . decreed whenever: (1) . . . terms
are sufficiently definite; (2) consideration is adequate; (3) there is
substantial similarity of the requested performance to the contractual terms;
(4) there is mutuality of remedies; and (5) plaintiff’s legal remedy is
inadequate.’”].) 
Plaintiff alleges
that on or about January 19, 2024, he offered to purchase the Subject Property
for $2,400,000 pursuant to the terms and conditions of Plaintiff’s Offer.  (FAC ¶5.) 

Plaintiff alleges
¶32A of Plaintiff’s Offer provided that “This offer shall be deemed revoked . .
. unless by the date and time in paragraph 3C [3 calendar days after Buyer’s
signature] the offer is signed by Seller and a Copy of the Signed offer is
delivered to Buyer or Buyer’s Authorized Agent.”  (FAC ¶6.) 
Plaintiff alleges Defendant, the Seller, signed Plaintiff’s Offer more
than 3 days later, on February 2, 2024.  (FAC ¶6.) 
Plaintiff alleges because paragraph 3C constituted a condition for
Plaintiff’s benefit Plaintiff was entitled to, and did, waive that condition,
thereby accepting Defendants’ tardy acceptance. 
(FAC ¶6.)  
Plaintiff alleges
he waived the three-day condition by urging Defendant to sign Plaintiff’s Offer
more than 3 days after it was presented to Defendant.  (FAC ¶7.) 
Plaintiff alleges that on January 30, 2024, he emailed Defendant, “Steve
are you going to send me the RPA [the Residential Purchase Agreement]?”  (FAC ¶7.) 
Plaintiff alleges Defendant responded on February 3, 2024, “You will
have the seller signed purchase agreement sent to you by Monday.”  (FAC ¶7.) 
Plaintiff alleges Plaintiff received the purchase agreement executed by
Defendant on February 5, 2024.  (FAC ¶7,
Exh. 2.)  Plaintiff alleges rather than
reject it or notify Defendant that it was too late and would not be accepted,
Plaintiff confirmed Defendants’ acceptance and on February 6, 2024, emailed Defendants,
“According to the document you have provided, Lida has ACCEPTED our offer as it
was submitted WITHOUT any counteroffer.” 
(FAC ¶7.)  
Plaintiff alleges
after he initially accepted Plaintiff’s Offer on February 2, 2024, and after he
tolerated Defendants’ attempt to modify it, Defendants breached the Agreement
by wrongfully denying its existence and their obligations imposed by the
Agreement and refused to consummate the sale for reasons which subsequently
became known to Plaintiff.  (FAC
¶10.)  Plaintiff alleges on information
and belief that Defendant had been secretly attempting to obtain a $1,900,000
loan to encumber the very Subject Property Defendant had offered to sell to
Plaintiff.  (FAC ¶10.)  Plaintiff alleges that on February 2, 2024,
the Defendant Trustee executed (a) a deed transferring the Subject Property
from the Trust (which the Trust was obligated to sell to Plaintiff) to the
individual Defendant, (b) a promissory note for $1,900,000, and (c) a Deed of
Trust securing the promissory note and which encumbered the Subject Property.  (FAC ¶10.) 
Plaintiff alleges that because Defendant was uncertain that the loan
would be made, Defendant continued negotiating with Plaintiff and on February
7, 2024, again made the same counteroffer previously made on January 22, 2024
(but which they had disregarded on February 2, 2024) which Plaintiff then
accepted on February 10, 2024.  (FAC ¶10,
Exh. 2.)   Plaintiff alleges that because the loan was consummated
on February 8, 2024, and individual Defendant received the loan proceeds,
Defendant decided to abort the sale and conceal their decision from Plaintiff
for reasons best known to them.  (FAC
¶10.)  Plaintiff alleges on information
and belief that Defendant is now attempting surreptitiously to sell the Subject
Property to others, breaching the Agreement and exposing as false their
commitment in section 6 of the Deed of Trust, namely that “Borrower must occupy
. . . the Property as Borrower’s principal residence within 60 days for at
least one year . . ..”  (FAC ¶10.)
Plaintiff alleges
Defendant has breached the Agreement by denying its existence and refusing to abide
by any of its terms and conditions including their obligation to open escrow.  (FAC ¶12.) 
Plaintiff alleges the terms and conditions of the Agreement including
the consideration was equitable fair, just, and reasonable.  (FAC ¶13.) 
Plaintiff alleges he has duly performed all the terms and conditions
required of him and was and is ready, willing and able to perform the Agreement.  (FAC ¶14.) 
Plaintiff alleges that Paragraph 22 of the Agreement provides that the
prevailing party is entitled to attorney fees and costs of litigation, which
are hereby requested.  (FAC ¶15.)  Plaintiff alleges that although the Agreement
provides for mediation, Plaintiff is excused from mediating before filing this
action because Defendant is currently attempting to sell the Subject Property
and if successful, mediation would inhibit Plaintiff’s right to specific
performance.  (FAC ¶15.)  
Plaintiff fails
to sufficiently assert a cause of action for breach of contract for specific
performance.  Plaintiff alleges an agreement
was breached (¶12), but fails to allege the inadequacy of a legal remedy by
simultaneously requesting a cause of action for damages for breach of contract,
without such damages being alleged in the alternative.  (See Brandolino v. Lindsay
(1969) 269 Cal.App.2d 319, 324 [“A complaint may allege inconsistent theories
of a cause of action in the alternative (2 Witkin, Cal.Procedure,
Pleading, s 181, p. 1160), including theories seeking specific performance of
an agreement, or in the alternative, damages for the breach thereof  [Citations.] and, the court may award damages
if plaintiffs are not entitled to specific performance. [Citations].”],
internal citations omitted, emphasis added.) 
Further, Plaintiff fails to allege that the underlying contract is both
reasonable and supported by adequate consideration; the existence of a
mutuality of remedies; and whether the contractual terms are sufficiently
definite to enable the court to know what it is to enforce.
Accordingly,
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s FAC is sustained with 20 days leave
to amend.
 
          Conclusion
Defendant’s
demurrer to Plaintiff’s FAC is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
