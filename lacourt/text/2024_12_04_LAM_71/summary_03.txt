And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by Defendant Lida Mirzakhanian and has found that the Plaintiff Alexander Margarian's first amended complaint fails to state a cause of action for breach of contract. The court has sustained Defendant's demurrer with 20 days leave to amend. The court has also noted that Plaintiff's complaint fails to allege the inadequacy of a legal remedy, the existence of a mutuality of remedies, and whether the contractual terms are sufficiently definite to enable the court to know what it is to enforce.

The court has also taken issue with the Plaintiff's failure to sufficiently meet and confer with the Defendant before filing the demurrer, in violation of California Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41. However, the court has concluded that this failure is not grounds to overrule or sustain the demurrer.

The court has granted Defendant's demurrer and has sustained it with 20 days leave to amend. The court has also ordered the parties to give notice of the decision.
