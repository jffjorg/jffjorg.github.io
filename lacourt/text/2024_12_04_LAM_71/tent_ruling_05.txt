[1] The Court notes Defendant’s demurrer does not contain
page numbers in violation of CRC, Rule 2.109. 
“Each page must be numbered consecutively at the bottom unless a rule
provides otherwise for a particular type of document. The page numbering must
begin with the first page and use only Arabic numerals (e.g., 1, 2, 3). The
page number may be suppressed and need not appear on the first page.”  (CRC, Rule 2.109.)  Defendant is admonished for her failure to
number pages, which creates unnecessary delay for all who review Defendant’s
demurrer, including the Court.
