And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the dispute between Gutierrez and the City over whether Gutierrez used profanity during a safety briefing. The City claims that Gutierrez used profanity, while Gutierrez denies it. The judge finds that the witnesses who testified at the hearing denied hearing any profanity and would have remembered if they had. The judge also notes that the investigation into the incident was classified as "Not Resolved". The judge concludes that the City failed to present any additional evidence at the hearing that could change the Not Resolved finding, and that Gutierrez fails to show that the outcome of the investigation has any preclusive effect on the Board of Rights evidentiary hearing. The judge's tentative ruling is that the City's claim that Gutierrez used profanity is not supported by the evidence.
