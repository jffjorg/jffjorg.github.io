            [1] Coronado
failed to provide courtesy copies of the application for a right to attach
order and notice of the application, in violation of the Presiding Judge’s
First Amended General Order Re:
Mandatory Electronic Filing. 
His counsel is admonished to provide courtesy copies in all future
filings.

Coronado also presents evidence that Defendants currently list Yireh’s other
properties for sale and have listed Rodriguez’s home in the past.  Coronado Decl., ¶¶ 11-12, 14-16, Exs. 12,
14-17.  He asserts Defendants intend to put
the proceeds of these sales beyond creditors’ reach.  Coronado Decl., ¶¶ 11, 16-17.  The court need not discuss this in detail; Coronado
does not need to demonstrate a likelihood of harm for a noticed application for
a right to attach order.
