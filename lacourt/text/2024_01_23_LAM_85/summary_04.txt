And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses two issues. First, Coronado failed to provide courtesy copies of the application for a right to attach order and notice of the application, which is in violation of the Presiding Judge's mandatory electronic filing order. As a result, Coronado's counsel is admonished to provide such copies in all future filings. Second, Coronado presents evidence that the defendants have listed Yireh's properties for sale and have listed Rodriguez's home in the past, and Coronado asserts that the defendants intend to put the proceeds of these sales beyond creditors' reach. The judge finds that Coronado does not need to demonstrate a likelihood of harm for a noticed application for a right to attach order, so the court need not discuss this issue in detail.
