Plaintiff alleges that Defendant made payments in the total sum of $5,000.00,

Plaintiff submitted the declaration of Humberto
Matz, the Vice President of Creditors Adjustment
Bureau, Inc. (Matz Decl., ¶ 1.) Matz provided a
summary of the case and attached the executed promissory note between the
parties reflecting the terms and conditions of the agreement. (Matz Decl.,
¶¶ 4-7, Ex. 1.) Plaintiff also submitted the
declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel, Eric Jun, stating that Plaintiff calculated
the prejudgment interest at 10% per annum from January 27, 2024 to October 30,
2024. (Jun Decl., ¶ 4.) Thus, Plaintiff claims $69,421.74 in total accrued
interest. 
 
Further, Mr. Jun represents that the agreement
provides “that if legal actions be taken to collenct any sums due and owing
thereunder, Defendant shall pay resasonable attorneys’ fees necessitated
thereby.” (Jun Decl., ¶ 5.) Thus, Plaintiff seeks an
award of attorneys fees pursuant to Local Rule 3.214 in the amount of
$11,037.83. (Ibid.) According to the fee schedule in Local Rule 3.214,
attorney’s fees in default cases over $100,000 are calculated as $2,890 plus 1%
of the excess over $100,000. In this case, $11,037.83 reflects the total amount in accordance with Local Rule
3.214 ($2,890 plus 1% of the excess over $100,000.00, which is $8,147.83, for a
total amount of $11,037.83). 
 
Since Plaintiff has complied with all the
requirements, Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is GRANTED. 
 
III. CONCLUSION 
 
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment
is GRANTED.
