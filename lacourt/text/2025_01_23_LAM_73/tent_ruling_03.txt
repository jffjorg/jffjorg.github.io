The Court GRANTS IN PART Defendant HPC Vineburn, LLC’s Motion to Tax
Plaintiffs’ Costs. Plaintiffs are awarded costs in the sum of $29,265.45.  
 
I.           
BACKGROUND
 
On January 6, 2023, Plaintiffs Joseph F. Farivar Investment Group,
Inc. (“FIG”) and Bordan Shoe Company, Inc. (“Bordan”) filed this action against
Defendants HPC Vineburn, LLC (“HPC”); Nardon Liquidating Corp. (“Nardon”);
Meruelo Maddux Properties – 1919 Vineburn Street, LLC (“Maddux”); Vineburn
Property, LLC; Benedetta Nardon, as an individual and as a Trustee of the
Nardon Family Trust dated October 27, 1982 and as Trustee of the M Nardon
Marital Trust; Marilyn N. Knoop, as an individual; Louis H. Knoop, as an
individual; George Mavredakis, an individual; Vivian Mavredakis, an individual;
Mario P. Minni, as an individual and as the Trustee of the Minni Family Trust
dated April 18, 1996 f/b/o the Minni Family; Patricia J. Minni, as an
individual and as the Trustee of the Minni Family Trust dated April 18, 1996
f/b/o the Minni Family and as Trustee of the Minni Family Bypass Trust; Armando
B. Tomasulo, as an individual and as Trustee of the Tomasulo Family Trust dated
October 20, 1994 f/b/o the Tomasulo Family; Pasqua S. Tomasulo, as an individual
and as Trustee of the Tomasulo Family Trust dated October 20, 1994 f/b/o the
Tomasulo Family; and Does 1-100, inclusive. 

 
On March 1, 2023, Defendant HPC filed a Cross-Complaint against
Plaintiff FIG. 
 
On May 10, 2023, pursuant to a request for dismissal, the
following defendants were dismissed from this action: Louis H. Knoop, as an
individual; George Mavredakis, an individual; Vivian Mavredakis, an individual;
Mario P. Minni, as an individual and as the Trustee of the Minni Family Trust
dated April 18, 1996 f/b/o the Minni Family; Armando B. Tomasulo, as an
individual and as Trustee of the Tomasulo Family Trust dated October 20, 1994
f/b/o the Tomasulo Family; and Pasqua S. Tomasulo, as an individual and as
Trustee of the Tomasulo Family Trust dated October 20, 1994 f/b/o the Tomasulo
Family. 
 
On June 27, 2023, Defendant Maddux filed an answer to the
complaint. On such date, Defendant Maddux also filed a Cross-Complaint against
cross-defendant Highpoint Capital LLC. The Cross-Complaint alleges causes of
action for: (1) Express Indemnity; (2) Implied Indemnity; (3) Comparative
Contribution; (4) Total Equitable Indemnity; and (5) Declaratory Relief. 
 
On September 1, 2023, Defendant Maddux dismissed the first cause
of action in its cross-complaint. 
 
On September 26, 2023, the Court sustained Plaintiff FIG’s
demurrer to the Cross-Complaint filed by HPC, and HPC did not file an amended
Cross-Complaint.
 
On February 28, 2024, Plaintiffs FIG and Bordan filed the
operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against HPC; Nardon; Maddux; Vineburn
Property, LLC; Benedetta Nardon, as an individual and as a Trustee of the
Nardon Family Trust dated October 27, 1982 and as Trustee of the M Nardon
Marital Trust; Marilyn N. Knoop, as an individual; Patricia J. Minni, as an
individual and as the Trustee of the Minni Family Trust dated April 18, 1996
f/b/o the Minni Family and as Trustee of the Minni Family Bypass Trust; and
Does 1-100, inclusive.
 
The FAC alleged the following causes of action: (1) Continuing
Nuisance; (2) Permanent Nuisance; (3) Continuing Trespass; (4) Permanent
Trespass; (5) Negligence; (6) Negligence Per Se; (7) Contribution; (8)
Equitable Indemnity; and (9) Declaratory Relief. 
 
On June 5, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary
adjudication. 
 
On June 28, 2024, Plaintiffs dismissed their claims against
Defendants Marilyn N. Knoop and Benedetta Nardon. 
 
On August 21, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment on the
pleadings as to all affirmative defenses asserted by Defendant HPC in its
answer. 
 
On September 3, 2024, the Court granted Defendants Benedetta
Nardon and Marilyn Knoop’s Application for Determination of Good Faith
Settlement.
 
On September 24, 2024, after hearing oral argument, the Court
granted Plaintiffs’ motion for summary adjudication of the first, third, fifth,
sixth, and ninth causes of action against Defendants HPC and Maddux. (09/24/24
Minute Order at p. 20.) The Court deemed Plaintiffs’ motion for summary
adjudication of the first, third, fifth, sixth, and ninth causes of action
against Defendants Benedetta Nardon and Marylin Knoop as moot. (09/24/24 Minute
Order at p. 20.) 
 
On October 2, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a motion for entry of final
judgment in conformance with grant of summary adjudication.
 
Also, on October 2, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a request for dismissal
as to the following remaining claims against Defendants HPC and Maddux:
permanent nuisance, permanent trespass, contribution, and indemnity. Dismissal
of such causes of action against said defendants was entered on October 3,
2024.
 
On October 8, 2024, after hearing, the Court granted Plaintiffs’
motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the answer of Defendant HPC with 10
days leave to amend. (10/08/24 Minute Order at p. 6.) 
 
On October 15, 2024, Defendant HPC filed an amended answer to the
FAC. 
 
On October 24, 2024, after hearing, the Court granted Plaintiffs’
motion for entry of judgment. (10/24/24 Minute Order.) The Court indicated that
“Plaintiffs have established that an entry of final judgment is appropriate in
the total amount of $12,245,108.42 against Defendants HPC and Maddux, jointly
and severally. (10/24/24 Minute Order at p. 10.) 
 
On October 31, 2024, pursuant to a request for dismissal filed by
Plaintiffs, Defendant Patricia J. Minni was dismissed from this action. 
 
On November 7, 2024, after hearing, the Court granted the motion
to set aside the determination of good faith settlement filed by Defendant HPC
and Cross-Defendant Highpoint Capital LLC. 
 
Also, on November 7, 2024, the Court entered judgment in this
action following the granting of Plaintiffs’ motion for summary adjudication. (See
11/07/24 Judgment.) Judgment was entered in favor of Plaintiffs and against
Defendants HPC and Maddux as to the first, third, fifth, sixth, and ninth
causes of action in the FAC. (11/07/24 Judgment at ¶ 1.) The Court incorporated
its September 24, 2024 order granting the motion for summary adjudication in
the judgment. (11/07/24 Judgment at ¶ 2.) Plaintiffs are to recover
$12,245,108.42 from Defendants HPC and Maddux, jointly and severally, with
interest thereon at the rate of ten percent per annum from the date of entry of
judgment until paid. (11/07/24 Judgment at ¶ 3.) As to the ninth cause of
action for declaratory relief, the Court indicated that Defendants HPC and
Maddux “are the cause of, and are responsible for, the 1,4-dioxane
contamination in the subsurface at 4335 Valley Boulevard, Los Angeles,
California, and . . . Plaintiffs are not the cause of, or responsible for, such
contamination.” (11/07/24 Judgment at p. 2:26-3:1.) Further, the judgment
indicates that Plaintiffs are to recover their costs and disbursements to be
determined following entry of judgment. (11/07/24 Judgment at ¶ 4.) 
 
On November 14, 2024, pursuant to a request for dismissal filed by
Plaintiffs, the causes of action asserted against Defendants Nardon and
Vineburn Property, LLC were dismissed. 
 
On November 15, 2024, Plaintiffs filed and served notice of entry
of judgment via e-mail. 
 
On November 22, 2024, Plaintiffs filed and served a memorandum of
costs, in which Plaintiffs seek total costs of $30,765.48 consisting of the following
items: (1) $3,123.68 for filing and motion fees (Item 1); (2) $150.00 for jury
fees (Item 2); (3) $18,588.60 for deposition costs (Item 4); (4) $7,403.20 for
service of process (Item 5); and (5) $1,500.00 for court reporter fees as
established by statute (Item 12). 
 
On December 27, 2024, Defendant HPC filed a notice of appeal,
which indicates that Defendant HPC is appealing the judgment entered in this
matter. 
 
On January 3, 2025, Defendant Maddux filed a notice of appeal,
which indicates that Defendant Maddux is appealing the judgment entered in this
matter. 
 
On December 9, 2024, Defendant HPC filed a Motion to Tax
Plaintiffs’ Costs, arguing: 
 
·      
The costs sought are not recoverable or are unreasonable and
unsubstantiated.
·      
The Court lacks jurisdiction to award costs at this juncture. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiffs argue that:
 
·      
All costs presented by Plaintiffs are recoverable. 
·      
A costs award is appropriate at this time.
 
Defendant Maddux filed a notice of joinder, which indicates that
it joins Defendant HPC’s motion to tax Plaintiffs’ costs. 
 
As of January 17, 2025, no reply brief has been filed. Any reply
brief was required to have been filed and served at least five court days
before the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 
 
II.           
ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard for Motion to Tax Costs 
 
“Except as otherwise provided by statute, a
prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any
action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).) A prevailing party
is “the party with a net monetary recovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd.
(a)(4).) 
 
“The right to recover . . . costs is
determined entirely by statute.” (Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp. (2009)
178 Cal.App.4th 44, 71.) “In ruling upon a motion to tax costs, the trial
court’s first determination is whether the statute expressly allows the
particular item and whether it appears proper on its face.” (Ibid.)
“If so, the burden is on the objecting party to show the costs to be
unnecessary or unreasonable.” (Ibid., citation omitted.) Items not
expressly allowed or prohibited by CCP § 1033.5 “may be allowed or denied in
the court’s discretion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(4).) An award of
costs is subject to the limitation that “[a]llowable costs shall be reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or
beneficial to its preparation.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(2).)
Moreover, costs which are allowed “shall be reasonable in amount.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(3).) 
 
“[I]tems on a verified cost bill are prima
facie evidence the costs, expenses and services listed were necessarily
incurred, and when they are properly challenged the burden of proof shifts to
the party claiming them as costs.” (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167
Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) “[T]he burden is upon the moving party to establish the
illegality of the challenged items; otherwise the amount demanded in the
verified cost bill is controlling.” (Wilson v. Nichols (1942) 55
Cal.App.2d 678, 682-83.) “If the items appearing on a cost bill appear to be
proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that
they were not reasonable or necessary.” (Ladas v. California State Auto
Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.) “On the other hand, if the items are
properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the
party claiming them as costs.” (Ibid.) “[T]he mere filing of a motion to
tax costs may be a proper objection to an item, the necessity of which appears
doubtful, or which does not appear to be proper on its face.” (Nelson v.
Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131, internal quotations omitted.)
 
B.      The Effect of
the Pending Appeal

 
Initially, the Court will address
Defendant HPC’s argument that the Court lacks jurisdiction to award costs given
the pending appeal of the judgment. (Memo. of Ps and As at p. 8:8-25.) Defendant
HPC argues that the “proceeding seeking costs should be stayed pending the
outcome of the forthcoming appeal.” (Memo. of Ps. and As at p. 4:24-25.) 
 
“[T]he perfecting of an appeal stays
proceedings in the trial court upon the judgment or order appealed from or upon
the matters embraced therein or affected thereby, including enforcement of the
judgment or order, but the trial court may proceed upon any other matter
embraced in the action and not affected by the judgment or order.” (Varian
Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino (2005) 35 Cal.4th 180, 189.) “Unless an undertaking is given, the
perfecting of an appeal shall not stay enforcement of the judgment or order in
the trial court if the judgment or order is for . . . (1) [m]oney or the payment
of money, whether consisting of a special fund or not, and whether payable by
the appellant or another party to the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 917.1, subd.
(a)(1).)
 
“Under
section 916, the trial court is divested of subject matter jurisdiction over
any matter embraced in or affected by the appeal during the pendency of that
appeal.” (Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino, supra, 35 Cal.4th 180, 196-97.) “Thus, [the trial court]
is without power to proceed further as to any matter embraced therein until the
appeal is determined.” (Ibid.) Any proceedings “taken after [a] notice
of appeal [is] filed are a nullity.” (Davis v. Thayer (1980) 113
Cal.App.3d 892, 912.) “The purpose of the automatic stay under section 916 is
to preserve the status quo until the appeal is decided . . . by maintaining the
rights of the parties in the same condition they were before the order was
made.” (Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino, supra, 35
Cal.4th 180, 198.) “Otherwise, the trial court could render the appeal futile
by altering the appealed judgment . . . by conducting other proceedings that
may affect it.” (Ibid.) “The primary example of collateral matters not
affected by a notice of appeal are awards of attorney fees or sanctions.” (United
Grand Corp. v. Malibu Hillbillies, LLC (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th 142, 161.) 
 
Initially,
the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that Defendant HPC’s request for a stay is
procedurally deficient as it was not articulated in the notice of motion. “A
notice of motion must state in the opening paragraph the nature of the order
being sought and the grounds for issuance of the order.” (Cal. R. Ct., rule
3.1110(a).) The Court therefore DENIES Defendant HPC’s procedurally improper
request for a stay. 
 
Irrespective
of the procedural deficiencies of Defendant HPC’s request for a stay, the Court
is aware that both Defendants HPC and Maddux are appealing this Court’s entry
of judgment. The Court, however, finds that Defendant HPC’s argument that the
Court lacks jurisdiction to award costs at this juncture is not persuasive. The
Court informs Defendant HPC that “filing a notice of appeal does not stay any
proceedings to determine the matter of costs . . . .” (Korchemny v. Piterman (2021) 68 Cal.App.5th 1032, 1052.) Here, the
judgment indicates that Plaintiffs shall recover their costs and disbursements.
(11/07/24 Judgment at ¶ 4.) The Court finds that awarding costs is a collateral
matter and does not deprive this Court of subject matter jurisdiction from
determining Plaintiffs’ entitlement to certain costs. Defendant HPC has
presented no applicable legal authority which stands for the proposition that a
pending appeal prevents the trial court from awarding costs. 
 
C.      The Cost
Items at Issue
 
Filing and
Motion Fees
 
Defendant HPC
takes issue with the $1,268.72 of the $3,123.68 in filing and motion fees that
is claimed in Plaintiffs’ memorandum of costs. 
 
Initially,
the Court notes that there is a three (3) cent discrepancy as the March 7, 2023
ex parte application for extension of time to serve was not $74.95 as
claimed on the memorandum of costs but was rather $74.92 as set forth in the
invoice attached to counsel’s declaration in opposition to the motion. (See
Memorandum of Costs Worksheet at p.4; see also McCormick Decl., ¶ 11(a), Exh. A
at p. 1.) 
 
Filing and motion fees are allowable as costs. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1033.5, subd. (a)(1).) Here, Plaintiffs submitted a memorandum of costs which
is prima facie evidence that the costs and expenses were necessarily
incurred. Additionally, Plaintiffs have presented evidence of the costs
incurred, and their counsel has attested to the necessity of the filing and
motion fees. (McCormick Decl., ¶¶ 3, 4, 5, 13, 14; Exh. A.) Defendant HPC has
not met its burden in challenging the reasonableness of such costs. Defendant HPC
merely argues that certain cost items concerning filing and motion fees were
not reasonably incurred but does not present any evidence on such point. In
fact, the declaration of Brian M. Ledger in support of the motion is void of
any statement that the costs incurred by Plaintiffs were unreasonable or were
unnecessary to this litigation.  Defendant
HPC has therefore not met its burden “of showing that an item is not properly
chargeable or is unreasonable . . . .” (Nelson v. Anderson, supra,
72 Cal.App.4th 111, 132.) “In law and motion practice, factual evidence is
supplied to the court by way of declarations.” (Calcor Space Facility, Inc.
v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 224.)
 
Given the
discrepancy in costs as to the March 7, 2023 ex parte application, the
Court will tax three (3) cents from Plaintiffs’ costs for filing and motion
fees. Thus, Defendant HPC’s request to tax filing and motion fees is GRANTED IN
PART. Plaintiffs are awarded filing and motion fees in the sum of $3,123.65
instead of the claimed $3,123.68. 
 
Deposition
Costs
 
Defendant HPC
contends that the Court should strike all $18,588.60 of Plaintiffs’ costs for
depositions as such depositions were not reasonably necessary for litigation.
(Memo. of Ps and As at p. 6:18-19.)
 
“Taking,
video recording, and transcribing necessary depositions, including an original
and one copy of those taken by the claimant and one copy of depositions taken
by the party against whom costs are allowed” are allowable as costs. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(3)(A).) “The burden of proof that the deposition was
unnecessary or that the costs of taking the deposition were unreasonable is on
the party seeking to have that item taxed or reduced.” (County of Kern v.
Ginn (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 1107, 1113.) 
 
Here,
Plaintiffs’ counsel has attested to the necessity and reasonableness of the
challenged deposition costs. (McCormick Decl., ¶¶ 6-10, 14.) Defendant HPC has not met its burden to
challenge the reasonableness of such costs under County of Kern v. Ginn,
supra, 146 Cal.App.3d 1107, 1113. Again, Defendant HPC merely argues,
without setting forth any facts in the declaration of its counsel, as to the
unreasonableness of such costs.
 
The Court therefore DENIES Defendant HPC’s request to strike and/or tax Plaintiffs’
deposition costs. 
 
Service of Process Fees
 
Defendant HPC seeks to strike $5,690.95 in costs related to service of
parties unrelated to Defendant HPC in this matter. (Memo. of Ps and As at p.
7:14-15.)
 
Costs for service of process are recoverable. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5,
subd. (a)(4).) “Ordinary witness fees pursuant to Section 68093 of the
Government Code” are also recoverable as costs. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5,
subd. (a)(7).) 
 
The Court notes that the challenged service of process costs concern
persons or entities that are not Defendant HPC. (Ledger Decl., Exh. B.)
Plaintiffs’ counsel states that the subpoenas served on Hazard Management
Consulting, South Coast Air Quality Management District, and the Workers
Compensation Insurance Bureau were reasonably necessary as the documents
received from such entities were reasonably necessary to the prosecution of
Plaintiffs’ claims. (McCormick Decl., ¶ 12.) 
 
Plaintiffs’ citation to Acosta v. SI Corp. (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th
1370 is inapposite as such case did not address the issue of imposing service
costs on now-dismissed defendants onto the remaining defendants. The Court
informs Plaintiffs that “[a] case is not authority for a proposition not
considered therein or an issue not presented by its own particular facts.” (McConnell
v. Advantest America, Inc. (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 596, 611.) Thus, the Court
fails to see how it is appropriate to impose service costs on Defendants HPC
and Maddux for service on now-dismissed defendants and third party entities. 
 
On the other hand, Defendant HPC cites to no legal authority standing for
the proposition that “[i]t is unreasonable for Defendant to pay for the service
of other persons or parties in this matter as those parties should be
responsible for costs related to their own service of process fees.” (Memo. of
Ps and As at p. 7:15-18.) The Court informs Defendant HPC that “[c]ontentions
are waived when a party fails to support them with reasoned argument and
citations to authority.” (Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v. Colombo (2003)
111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215.) 
 
Plaintiffs’ counsel has stated that the service of subpoenas on
third-party entities and all costs for service of process were all reasonably
necessary to the prosecution of Plaintiffs’ claims. (McCormick Decl., ¶¶ 12,
14; Exh. C.) Plaintiffs have also provided invoices to substantiate such costs.
(Id.) Given that the memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence
that the cost items were necessary incurred, and Plaintiffs’ counsel has
attested that the costs for service of process were all reasonably necessary,
the Court finds that Plaintiffs have substantiated such costs. Defendant HPC,
however, offers no evidence that the costs for service of process are
unreasonable or were unnecessary. As stated above, the declaration of Mr.
Legder is severely deficient and states no facts attesting to unreasonableness
or the lack of necessity of the challenged cost items. 
 
The Court therefore DENIES Defendant HPC’s request to tax $5,690.95 in
costs related to service of process. 
 
Court Reporter Fees
 
Defendant HPC argues that the $1,500.00 in claimed court reporter fees
should be stricken. 
 
Court
reporter fees as established by statute or allowable as costs. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(11).) Transcripts of court proceedings not ordered
by the court are not allowable as costs. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (b)(5).)
Charges for court reporter fees, which are an entirely different expense than
transcripts of court proceedings, are allowable. (Chaaban v. Wet Seal, Inc. (2012)
203 Cal.App.4th 49, 58-59.)  
 
The
opposition brief does not specifically address the appropriateness of the costs
claimed for court reporter fees. The Court takes such lack of response as a
waiver that such costs are inappropriate and were not ordered by the Court
under Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v. Colombo, supra, 111
Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215. Moreover, Plaintiffs have failed to provide any
invoices to substantiate court reporter fees. 
 
The Court
therefore GRANTS Defendant HPC’s request to strike Item 12 from Plaintiff’s
memorandum of costs for court reporter fees in the amount of $1,500.00. 
 
III.           
DISPOSITION

 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS IN PART Defendant HPC’s
Motion to Tax Plaintiffs’ Costs. Plaintiffs are awarded costs in the sum of
$29,265.45.
