The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal and enter judgment. The plaintiff, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., brought a collections case against the defendant, Senait Estifanos, for credit card debt in the amount of $27,895.85. The parties had previously stipulated that the action would be dismissed without prejudice, but with the understanding that the court would retain jurisdiction to enforce the settlement until payment was made in full. Defendant failed to cure a default on its payment obligation, and the plaintiff is seeking to vacate the dismissal and enter judgment in its favor. The court has granted the motion, vacating the dismissal and awarding the plaintiff $16,735.85 against the defendant.
