Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment (filed 11/25/24)
TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Plaintiff’s
motion to vacate dismissal and enter judgment pursuant to stipulation is
GRANTED. 
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
This is a
collections case. On October 28, 2021, Plaintiff Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
(“Plaintiff”) commenced this action by filing its Complaint against Defendant
Senait Estifanos (“Defendant”) for credit card debt in the amount of
$27,895.85.
 
On December 15,
2021, the Court approved the Stipulation for Entry of Judgment and Settlement
and Release & Dismissal of Action With Consent to Court Retaining
Jurisdiction Pursuant to C.C.P § 664.6 6 (“Stipulation”) submitted by Plaintiff
and signed by the parties. The Court ordered Plaintiff’s Complaint dismissed
without prejudice and stated that it retains jurisdiction to make orders to
enforce any and all terms of settlement, including judgment, pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure Section 664.6. 
 
On November 25,
2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to vacate dismissal under C.C.P. § 664.6 6
& enter judgment pursuant to stipulation, arguing:
·               
Defendant is in default and has failed to cure such
default. 
·               
The Court should therefore vacate the dismissal and
enter judgment pursuant to the Stipulation. 
Defendant has failed to oppose the motion. 
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.     
Legal
Standard for Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment  
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6
provides in part: 
 
(a) If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the
court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof,
the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over
the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of
the settlement.
 
(b) For purposes of this section, a
writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any of the following:
 
(1) The party.
 
(2) An attorney who represents the
party. “(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is authorized in writing
by the insurer to sign on the insurer’s behalf
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subds. (a),
(b).)
 
B.     
Dicussion
 
Plaintiff and Defendant stipulated
that the Court would dismiss the action without prejudice. (Declaration of
Ashley Mulhorn, ¶ 3; Ex. 1.) In return,
Defendant agreed to make specified monthly payments to Plaintiff until
Defendant paid the amount it owed Plaintiff ($27,895.85). (Id. at ¶ 4.)
 
Defendant made monthly payments
totaling $11,160.00 but then defaulted on its payment obligation. (Id.
at ¶ 5.) Plaintiff’s
counsel sent a default payment letter to Defendant on May 30, 2024 advising
Defendant that it was in default. (Id. at ¶ 6; Ex. 2.) Defendant has failed to bring its
payments current. (Id. at ¶ 7.)

 
Because
Defendant did not cure the default, Plaintiff asks the Court to enter judgment
in Plaintiff’s favor for $16,735.85, plus $510.00 in costs, for a total
judgment amount of $17,245.85. The Court grants the motion.
 
III.
DISPOSITION 
 
The Court
GRANTS Plaintiff Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.’s motion to vacate dismissal and enter
judgment. The Court vacates the December 15, 2021 dismissal and awards
Plaintiff $16,735.85 against Defendant Senait Estifanos. 
 
Moving party
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
