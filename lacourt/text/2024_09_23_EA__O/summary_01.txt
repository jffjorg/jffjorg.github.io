And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by WC Homes, LLC to the Plaintiff's first amended complaint. The court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, citing that the Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts that the Defendant controlled the public wash. The court found that the Plaintiff's allegations of damage to the safety fence and failure to repair it do not constitute sufficient control to give rise to a duty of care. The court also rejected the Plaintiff's argument that the Defendant caused the damage to the fence, finding that the Plaintiff's allegations were sufficient to establish causation. Finally, the court sustained the demurrer on the ground that the Plaintiff's first and second causes of action were duplicative and not distinct claims.
