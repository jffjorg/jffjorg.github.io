[1] Plaintiff did not
sue any Doe defendants. 
 


[2] The FAC is a form
complaint. 
 


[3] Plaintiff filed an
untimely opposition to the original demurrer.  
 


[4] The elements of a negligence claim and
a premises liability claim are the same: a legal duty of care, breach of that
duty, and proximate cause resulting in injury.” (Kesner v. Superior Court
(2016) 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1158.) “Premises liability ‘is grounded in the
possession of the premises and the attendant right to control and manage the
premises’ accordingly, ‘mere possession with its attendant right to control
conditions on the premises is a sufficient basis for the imposition of an
affirmative duty to act.’” (Ibid.) (See also Donnell v. California
Western School of Law (1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 715, 725-726 [“The existing
standard for premises liability, based on ownership, possession or control,
provides predictability and reasonably clear limits. Such limits on premises
liability are also consistent with the general policy underlying much of tort
law.”]; see also Preston v. Goldman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 108, 119 [“ownership and control [is] a fundamental requirement for ascribing
liability.”].) 
 


[5] In opposition,
Plaintiff argues that the FAC also alleges inadequate security. (Opp. p.
6:23-24.) However, a review of the FAC shows no such allegation. Therefore, as
this statement is not found within the four corners of the complaint, it will
not be considered. As for the allegation about no lighting on Defendant’s
property, that too will not be considered because neither party addressed the
allegation. Instead, both parties appear to focus on the alleged damage to the
fence. 
 


[6] The extent of the applicable law is found on page 6
of the opposition and focuses on the element of “control.” (See e.g., Opp. p. 6
[6 references to the word ‘control’].) 
 


[7] Plaintiff
argues that control can be shown is by evidence
that a defendant derived a commercial benefit from the use of public property.
(Opp. p. 6:8-10, citing Alcarez, supra, at p. 1164.) Plaintiff misstates the law. The
Alcarez court expressly rejected notions that liability for injuries on
adjacent property should depend upon whether the defendant derives a
commercial benefit from that property. (Id. at p. 1165-1166; see also p.
1166 [“[N]o case [] in which a defendant that exercised control over
property on which an injury occurred was found not liable simply because the
defendant derived no commercial benefit from that property.”]; see also dis.
opn. of Brown, J., at p. 1193 [“The
majority's response to these reasoned analyses is simply to sweep aside these
limiting principles as “dicta,” and to disapprove the language.”]; see also
dis. Opn. of Kennard, J. p. 1174.].)
 


[8] Additionally, another
tenant provided a declaration stating that he told the landlord on several
occasions that the cover of the meter box was either broken or missing. (Id.
at p. 1154.)
