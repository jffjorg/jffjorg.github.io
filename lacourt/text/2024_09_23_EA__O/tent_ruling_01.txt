  Case Number:  23PSCV03238    Hearing Date:   September 23, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
WC Homes,
LLC’s DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFF’S FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT is SUSTAINED with
leave to amend namely because Plaintiff has not alleged that
Defendant controlled the wash.  
 
Background
 
This is a
premises liability case. 
 
On October
19, 2023, Plaintiff Jerry Lobo filed suit against WC Homes LLC[1]
for (1) general negligence and (2) premises liability arising from an incident
on 1/26/2021 wherein Plaintiff “entered Defendant’s property” and fell into the
adjacent flood wash. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant “damaged and knocked down
part of the safety fence protecting people from injury in the adjacent wash.
The defendant knowing it had damaged the fence, took no steps to repair it, or
otherwise protect people from crossing their land and being injured in the
adjacent wash.” (First Amended Complaint (FAC) p. 4 of 5 of PDF.)[2]

 
On February
26, 2024, Plaintiff filed POS, indicating that Defendant was served via
personal service on 2/26/24.
 
On May 3,
2024, Defendant a demurrer,[3]
which the court on May 30, 2024 sustained with 30 days leave to amend.
 
On June 28,
2024 Plaintiff filed his FAC for general negligence and premises liability.[4]

 
On August 20,
2024, Defendant filed the instant demurrer to the FAC.
 
On September
4, 2024, Plaintiff filed his opposition. 
 
On September
16, 2024, Defendant filed its reply. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
Defendant (again)
brings forth the demurrer pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(e) and (f)
which provides that a demurrer may be asserted when the pleading does not state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and the pleading is uncertain
(“uncertain” includes ambiguous and unintelligible), respectively. A demurrer
tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer must appear
on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters. (Code
of Civ. Proc. § 430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)
 
Discussion
 
Defendant (again)
demurs on the grounds that it does not own, possess or control the public wash;
the San Bernardino County flood wash is owned by the County of San Bernardino.
 
Previous
Ruling and Amendments
 
Previously,
the court sustained the demurrer because the “pleading could use additional
facts and clarity” as to whether Defendant created a dangerous condition;
namely, ultimate facts about what Defendant allegedly did on its own
land or on the County’s property. (See Ruling p. 3 of 5 of PDF, citing Sexton
v. Brooks (1952) 39 Cal.2d 153, 157.) Now, the FAC has pled more
facts: Defendant allegedly “damaged and knocked down part of the safety
fence protecting people from injury in the adjacent wash” and had “no lighting
on [Defendant’s] land.” (FAC p. 4 of 5 of PDF, emphasis added.)[5]

 
The issue is whether Defendant WC Homes, who does
not possess nor own the wash, controls the wash.[6]
For reasons to be discussed below, Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts
that Defendant controlled the wash. 
 
Case
Law[7]
 
Generally, “A defendant cannot be held
liable for the defective or dangerous condition of property which it [does] not
own, possess, or control.” (Isaacs v. Huntington Memorial Hospital
(1985) 38 Cal.3d 112;
see also Sprecher v. Adamson Cos. (1981) 30 Cal.3d 358, 372.) As
for how much control is sufficient control to give rise to a duty, the court turns
to Alcaraz v. Vece (1997) 14 Cal.4th 1149, the predominant
case relied upon by Plaintiff in opposition. 
 
In Alcarez,
a plaintiff was injured when he walked from
the public sidewalk onto a narrow strip of land located in front of the rental
property where he lived and stepped on a broken water meter box. Both the land
and the meter box were owned by the city, but the plaintiff sued his
landlord arguing that the landlord controlled the land by (i) periodic mowing
and (2) constructing (after the accident) a picket fence enclosing both
his land and the city’s strip of land.[8] The Alcaraz court
concluded that such evidence was sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact as
to whether the landlord exercised control over the strip of land. (Id. at
p. 1170.) For clarity, the Alcaraz court did not hold that mere
maintenance of an adjoining strip of land owned by another constitutes an
exercise of control over that property. “[T]he simple act of mowing a lawn on
adjacent property (or otherwise performing minimal, neighborly maintenance of
property owned by another) generally will [not], standing alone, constitute an
exercise of control over [the] property....” (Id. at p. 1167, 1170.)  The
court found the enclosure “highly relevant” because “[i]t is obvious that the
act of enclosing property with a fence constitutes an exercise of control over
that property.” (Id. at p. 1167.) Effectively, what Alcaraz stands for is that control can be shown by some affirmative
action that affects the adjoining landowner's ability to control their
property; the conduct of the defendant landowner amounts to a “notorious and
open public display of control” over adjacent property. (Id. at
p. 1167.) 
 
Here, there is no allegation that Defendant erected the fence nor
allegations of any assertive, controlling conduct that
Defendant WC Homes controlled the wash. 
 
Therefore, as Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts that Defendant
controlled the wash, the demurrer is SUSTAINED. 
 
Causation

 
Defendant
argues that “Plaintiff’s FAC on its face does not allege WC Homes caused the
damage to the fence that was the subject of Plaintiff’s alleged fall.”
(Demurrer p. 8.) 
 
Here, the
allegation is as follows:
 
On information and belief, the owners of 1792 East
Mission Boulevard used its raw land as a storage lot for large steel
containers, heavy equipment, and semi tractor type vehicles and machinery, and
at some time prior to the incident in question and prior to January 2021 had
damaged and knocked down part of the safety fence protecting people
from injury in the adjacent wash. The defendant knowing it had damaged the
fence, took no steps to repair it, or otherwise protect people from
crossing their land and being injured in the adjacent wash. (FAC p. 4 of 5 of
PDF, emphasis added.)
 
Accordingly, assuming the reasonable inferences that
may be drawn from those facts (Miklosy v. Regents of University of
California (2008) 44 Cal.4th 876, 883), Plaintiff is alleging that
Defendant damaged the fence, and that Defendant caused the
injury. 
 
Therefore, contrary to Defendant’s assertion that
Plaintiff has not expressly alleged “that WC Homes actually caused the
damage to the fence where Plaintiff allegedly fell” (Demurrer p. 8:19-21), the
demurrer on the grounds of causation is overruled. 
 
Duplicative COAs
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s first and second causes
of action are really the same claim since liability of landowners is governed
by general negligence principals. (Demurrer pp. 8-9.) Where only one set of
operative facts is pled, based on the same primary right and same primary duty,
the additional COAs are only additional counts based on the same obligation and
thus the same cause of action. (Demurrer p. 9, citing Kaufman & Broad Bldg.
Co. v. City & Suburban Mortg. Co. (1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 206, 215; see also
Panos v. Great Western Packing Co. (1943) 21 Cal.2d 636, 638-639; see also
Peiser v. Mettler (1958) 50 Cal. 2d 594, 605.) With such a pleading, a demurrer
is properly sustained. (Demurrer p. 9, citing Careau & Co. v. Security
Pacific Business Credit, Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1371, 1401.)
 
Here, Plaintiff has not advanced any arguments rebutting
the foregoing authority. 
 
Therefore, the court sustains the demurrer on said
ground. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, the demurrer is sustained with leave to amend.
