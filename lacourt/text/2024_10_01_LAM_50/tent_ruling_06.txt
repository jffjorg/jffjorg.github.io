[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:

 
DEFENDANTS [sic]
  1346 STANLEY, LLC MOTION TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT UNDER MANDATORY PROVISION OF
  C.C.P. § 473(b)




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 



 
Background
Plaintiff Nawal
Bengholam (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on October 27, 2023, against
Defendants 1346 Stanley, LLC (“1346 Stanley”), Stanley 1, LLC, and Charles
& Cynthia Eberly Inc. The Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) breach
of contract/covenant of quiet enjoyment/warranty of habitability, (2) tortious
breach of the implied warranty of habitability, (3) negligence, (4) violation
of unfair business practices, (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress,
and (6) wrongful eviction. 
            On January 18, 2024, default was
entered against 1346 Stanley. 
            On
February 23, 2024, 1346 Stanley filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff. The
Cross-Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) implied indemnity, (2) express
indemnity, 
(3) declaratory relief, (4)
contribution, (5) negligence, and (6) breach of contract. 
1346 Stanley now moves for
an order setting aside the default entered against it. Plaintiff opposes. 
Discussion
Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (b) provides in pertinent part: 
 
“The court may, upon any terms as may
be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or
her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this
relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed
to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall
be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.”
 “[B]ecause the law strongly favors trial and
disposition on the merits, any doubts in applying section
473 must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from default.” ((Elston v. City of Turlock (1985) 38 Cal.3d 227, 233 [negative treatment on other grounds].) Where the party in default moves promptly to seek relief, and no prejudice to the opposing
party will result from setting aside the default, “very slight evidence will be required to justify a court in
setting aside the default.” (Ibid.)
Code
of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) also contains a mandatory provision:
“Notwithstanding any other requirements of this section, the court shall,
whenever an application for relief is made no more than six months after entry
of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s sworn
affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect,
vacate any (1) resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her
client, and which will result in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting
default judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client, unless the
court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the
attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” 
In support of the
motion, 1346 Stanley submits the declaration of its counsel, who states that “[o]n
May 7, 2024, counsel for Defendants [sic][1]
became aware that they were in default, and that their declaration had not
extended the deadline by 30 days as anticipated…” (Derflinger Decl., ¶ 4.) The
Court notes that 1346 Stanley’s counsel does not appear to specify what “declaration”
he is referring to. 1346 Stanley’s counsel further states that “[o]n that same
day, counsel for Defendants [sic] requested counsel for Plaintiffs [sic] agree
to stipulate to set aside the default. Counsel for Plaintiff did not respond.”
(Derflinger Decl., ¶ 4.)
1346 Stanley’s counsel
states that “[d]efault was entered against Defendants [sic] as a result of
their attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, and/or neglect – i.e., my mistake,
inadvertence and neglect. The entry of default against Defendants [sic] was not
due to any conduct or neglect of Defendants [sic] themselves. The error was
solely attributable to Defendants’ [sic] counsel.” (Derflinger Decl., ¶ 5.) 
1346 Stanley indicates
that it is “moving for mandatory relief from entry of default under C.C.P. § 473(b) on the grounds of their [sic] attorney’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (Mot. at p. 2:8-9, emphasis
omitted.) 
In the opposition,
Plaintiff asserts that 1346 Stanley’s motion is untimely, as it was not filed
within six months of the entry of default. However, as discussed, 1346 Stanley
seeks relief under the mandatory provision of Code of
Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), which provides that “[n]otwithstanding
any other requirements of this section, the court shall, whenever an
application for relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment,
is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit
attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any
(1) resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her client, and which
will result in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting default judgment
or dismissal entered against his or her client, unless the court finds that the
default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney’s mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (Emphasis added.) No judgment has yet been
entered in this matter. Accordingly, the Court does not find that Plaintiff has
shown that the instant motion is untimely. 
Plaintiff also argues
that “STANLEY’s counsel contends that they filed a declaration regarding an
extension of time to meet and confer on the pleadings which is the reason they
were late in the filing of their responsive pleading. No such declaration was
attached, filed with the court, or sent to Plaintiff’s counsel likely because
it does not exist. Absent this, they have provided no excuse for not timely
responding to the complaint or not timely filing this motion.” (Opp’n at p.
3:4-8.) However, 1346 Stanley’s counsel states in his declaration under penalty
of perjury that “[d]efault was entered against Defendants [sic] as a result of
their [sic] attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, and/or neglect – i.e., my
mistake, inadvertence and neglect.” (Derflinger Decl., ¶ 5.) The Court notes
that under the mandatory provision of Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), the attorney’s neglect does not
need to be excusable. ((Henderson v. Pacific
Gas & Electric Co. (2010) 187
Cal.App.4th 215, 225.) 
Based on the foregoing,
the Court grants 1346 Stanley’s motion to set aside the default under the
mandatory provision of Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (b). 
Lastly, the Court notes
that under Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (b), “[t]he court shall, whenever relief is granted based on an
attorney’s affidavit of fault, direct the attorney to pay reasonable
compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing counsel or parties.” Here, however,
Plaintiff has not provided evidence of any legal fees or costs. 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, 1346 Stanley’s
motion is granted. The default entered against 1346 Stanley on January 18, 2024 is ordered set aside. 
1346 Stanley is ordered to file its
answer to the Complaint within 10 days of the date of this
Order.¿    
1346 Stanley is ordered to give notice
of this Order.
