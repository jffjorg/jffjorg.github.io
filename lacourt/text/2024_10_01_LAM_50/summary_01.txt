And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is a response to a motion filed by the plaintiff, Hyung M. Do, to compel the defendant, Genoveva Rincon, to serve further responses to the plaintiff's form interrogatories (Set One) and to grant monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,599.77. The judge has decided to continue the motion to a new date and has ordered the parties to participate in a meet and confer/Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) to resolve their discovery disputes. The IDC is a mandatory conference where parties must discuss and attempt to resolve their discovery disputes in person or via telephone. The judge has also ordered the parties to have with them whatever materials are needed to make the IDC session productive and successful. If the parties resolve their discovery disputes before the IDC date, the plaintiff is ordered to take both the IDC and the motion off the calendar as soon as possible.
