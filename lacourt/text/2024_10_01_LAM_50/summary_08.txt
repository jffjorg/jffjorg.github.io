And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where plaintiff Circa 1200, LLC is seeking a default judgment against defendant Darius Kennedy. The judge notes that the default judgment package submitted by the plaintiff has some defects. Specifically, the proof of service does not indicate the date of service, and the plaintiff's counsel did not submit a declaration attesting to the amount of attorney's fees requested. As a result, the judge denies the request for default judgment without prejudice and will discuss with counsel a schedule for submitting a new default judgment package.
