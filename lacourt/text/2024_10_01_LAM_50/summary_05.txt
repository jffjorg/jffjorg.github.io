The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion to substitute Wendy Rosen as successor in interest to the deceased plaintiff, Cindy Rosen. The motion is unopposed. The judge reviewed the relevant California Code of Civil Procedure sections, including sections 377.30, 377.31, 377.11, and 377.32. The judge found that Wendy Rosen's supporting declaration does not provide all of the necessary information required by Code of Civil Procedure section 377.32, specifically the statements regarding Wendy Rosen's status as the decedent's successor in interest and her authority to act on behalf of the estate. As a result, the judge denied the motion without prejudice, requiring Wendy Rosen to provide the necessary information in a revised declaration.
