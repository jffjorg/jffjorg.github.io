And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted 1346 Stanley, LLC's motion to set aside the default entered against it. The default was entered on January 18, 2024, and 1346 Stanley's counsel became aware of it on May 7, 2024. The counsel claims that the default was caused by his own mistake, inadvertence, and/or neglect. The judge found that the motion is timely, as it was filed within six months of the entry of default, and that the attorney's neglect does not need to be excusable under the mandatory provision of Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). The judge also noted that Plaintiff has not provided evidence of any legal fees or costs to be paid by 1346 Stanley's counsel. The default is hereby set aside, and 1346 Stanley is ordered to file its answer to the Complaint within 10 days of the date of this Order.
