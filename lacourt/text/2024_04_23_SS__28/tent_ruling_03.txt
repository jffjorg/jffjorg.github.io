 Case Number:  21STCV31743    Hearing Date:   April 23, 2024    Dept:  28 On
August 26, 2021, Plaintiff Malvina Mkchyan (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Margaret Mary Lewis (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 for motor
vehicle tort and general negligence. 
On
May 15, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
November 3, 2023, Defendant’s counsel received Plaintiff’s responses to
Defendant’s demand for production and inspection of documents, set one. (Kelian
decs. ¶ 5.) 
On
January 19 and 30, 2024, Defendant’s counsel asked Plaintiff’s counsel for a
60-day extension of time to file a motion to compel further responses to the demand for production and inspection of documents. (Exhs. G & H.) Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond to the
request. (Kelian dec. ¶¶ 11-12.) 
On
February 22, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to compel further responses to the demand for production and inspection of documents, set one, and for sanctions,
to be heard on April 23, 2024. Plaintiff did not file an opposition. 
“Unless
notice of [a motion to compel further responses to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling] is given within 45 days of the service of the
verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any
specific later date to which the demanding party and the responding party have
agreed in writing, the demanding party waives any right to compel a further
response to the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).) “The 45-day
time limit is mandatory and ‘jurisdictional’ (court has no authority to grant a
late motion).”  (L. Edmon & C.
Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 8:1491,
p. 8H-38 (Cal. Practice Guide), citing Sexton v. Superior Court (Mullikin
Medical Center) (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) 
Defendant
filed her motion to compel further responses to the demand for production and inspection of documents well beyond the 45-day limitation period. Although Defendant’s
counsel asked Plaintiff’s counsel to extend the time to file the motion,
Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond to the request. 
It
is unclear, however, if Plaintiff’s responses to the demand for production and
inspection of documents were verified. “The 45-day deadline runs from the date
the verified response is served, not from the date originally set for
production or inspection.”  (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 8:1491.1, p. 8H-39.)
“If the responding party served unverified responses containing objections and
substantive responses, presumably the 45-day time limit does not commence until
the verifications are served.”  (Id.,
¶ 8:1491, pp. 8H-38 to 8H-39.) 
Defendant’s
motion does not appear to assert that Plaintiff’s responses were unverified.  However, the responses attached to the motion
as an exhibit contain only the signature of Plaintiff’s counsel. “The party to
whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed shall
sign the response under oath unless the response contains only objections.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.250, subd. (a).) Plaintiff’s responses do not contain
only objections. 
The
Court continues the hearing on Defendant’s motion for further responses to demand
for production and inspection of documents and for sanctions to a date to be
provided at the April 23, 2024 hearing. 
The
Court orders Defendant  to file a
supplemental declaration or brief explaining whether her motion is timely under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (c). Plaintiff may file a
response to Defendant’s supplemental filing. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court CONTINUES the hearing on Defendant Margaret Mary Lewis’s motion to
compel further responses to demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling,
set one, and for sanctions, to a date to be provided at the April 23, 2024 hearing. 
No
later than ten days before the continued hearing, Defendant Margaret Mary Lewis
shall file a supplemental declaration or brief explaining whether her motion to
compel further responses to demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, set one, and for sanctions is timely under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.310, subdivision (c). 
No
later than five days before the continued hearing, Plaintiff Malvina Mkchyan
may file a responsive declaration or brief explaining whether Defendant
Margaret Mary Lewis’s motion to compel further responses to demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, set one, and for sanctions is timely
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (c). 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
