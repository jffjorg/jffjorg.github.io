And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Shawnda Thomas. The Court finds that Shawnda Thomas did not owe Plaintiff a duty of care because she did not own, possess, or control the premises where the shooting took place. The Court has considered all the evidence and inferences reasonably drawn from it and views the evidence and inferences in the light most favorable to the opposing party. The Court concludes that the evidence is incapable of supporting a judgment for the losing party. The Court grants the motion and orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling.
