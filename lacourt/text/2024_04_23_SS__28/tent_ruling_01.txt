  Case Number:  20STCV10279    Hearing Date:   April 23, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers, the Court rules as  follows.  BACKGROUND  On  March 12, 2020, Plaintiff David Smiley (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against  Defendants Queen Arms Homeowners Association, Shawnda Foster, Kibron Asrat,  International Realty & Investments, Malcolm Bennett, and Does 1-100 for  general negligence and premises liability.  On  October 6, 2020, the Court granted the motion to strike filed by Defendant  Shawnda Thomas (erroneously sued and served as Shawnda Foster) and struck  Plaintiff’s claim against Defendant Shawnda Thomas for punitive damages with  leave to amend.  On  November 17, 2020, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint against Defendants  Queen Arms Homeowners Association (“HOA”), Steven Thomas (“Steven Thomas”),  Shawnda Foster, Kibron Asrat, International Realty & Investments, Malcolm  Bennett, and Does 1-100 for general negligence and premises liability.  On  December 16, 2020, Defendants HOA and Mac Bennett Enterprises, Inc. dba  International Realty & Investments filed answers to the first amended  complaint. In addition, Defendants HOA and Mac Bennett Enterprises, Inc. dba  International Realty & Investments filed a cross-complaint against  Cross-Defendants Steven Thomas and Roes 1-25 for equitable indemnity,  contribution, and declaratory relief.  On  December 30, 2020, Steven Thomas filed an answer to Plaintiff’s first amended  complaint.  On  February 3, 2021, Defendant Kibrom Asrat, erroneously sued and served  as Kibron Asrat (“Asrat”), filed an answer and a cross-complaint against  Cross-Defendants Steven Thomas and Roes 1-100 for implied indemnity,  contribution, and declaratory relief. On January 25, 2022, Steven Thomas filed an answer to Asrat’s  cross-complaint.  On  February 18, 2021, the Court (1) sustained Defendant Malcolm Bennett’s demurrer  to Plaintiff’s first amended complaint with leave to amend and (2) overruled  the demurrer of Defendant Shawnda Thomas (erroneously sued and served as  Shawnda Foster) (“Shawnda Thomas”).  On  March 18, 2021, Shawnda Thomas filed an answer to Plaintiff’s first amended  complaint.  On  March 24, 2021, the Court dismissed Defendant Malcolm Bennett with prejudice at  Plaintiff’s request.  On  April 20, 2023, the Court granted Asrat’s motion for summary judgment.  On May 5, 2023, the Court entered judgment  for Asrat.  On June 30, 2023, Plaintiff  filed a notice of appeal.  On  March 10, 2024, Shawnda Thomas filed a joinder in the motion for summary  judgment filed by HOA and International Realty & Investments on March 10,  2023.  Shawnda Thomas filed her own separate  statement of undisputed material facts and documentary evidence in support of  her joinder.  On  February 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition to Shawnda Thomas’s motion for  summary judgment. On March 28, 2024, Shawnda Thomas filed a reply.  On  April 9, 2024, the Court ruled that Shawnda Thomas’s joinder in the motion  for summary judgment, without reserving a separate hearing date, was not proper  because she had filed a separate statement and supporting evidence. The Court  took the joinder off calendar.  On April  11, 2024, Shawnda Thomas filed a motion for summary judgment to be heard on September  26, 2024.  On April 18, 2024, the Court  advanced the hearing on the motion (previously filed as a joinder) to April 23,  2024.  On  April 18, 2024, the Court granted the summary judgment motion filed by HOA and  International Realty & Investments.  Trial  is currently set for May 23, 2024.  PARTIES’ REQUESTS  Shawnda  Thomas asks the Court to grant summary judgment.  Plaintiff  asks the Court to deny the motion. SHAWNDA THOMAS'S EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS  SustainedLEGAL STANDARD  A.   Summary judgment  “‘[F]rom  commencement to conclusion, the party moving for summary judgment bears the  burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that  he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.’”  (LAOSD Asbestos Cases (2023) 87  Cal.App.5th 949, 945, quoting Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001)  25 Cal.4th 826, 850 (Aguilar).) “[T]he party moving for summary judgment  bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the  nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact; if he carries his burden of  production, he causes a shift, and the opposing party is then subjected to a  burden of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence  of a triable issue of material fact.”  (Aguilar,  supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 850.)             When the moving party is a  defendant, it must show that the plaintiff cannot establish at least one  element of the cause of action.  (Aguilar,  supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 853.) “The defendant has shown that the  plaintiff cannot establish at least one element of the cause of action by  showing that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain,  needed evidence.”  (Id. at p.  854.) The defendant must “present evidence, and not simply point out that the  plaintiff does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, needed  evidence.”  (Ibid.) Thus, “the  defendant must ‘support[ ]’ the ‘motion’ with evidence including ‘affidavits,  declarations, admissions, answers to interrogatories, depositions, and matters  of which judicial notice’ must or may ‘be taken.’ [Citation.] The defendant  may, but need not, present evidence that conclusively negates an element of the  plaintiff’s cause of action. The defendant may also present evidence that the  plaintiff does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, needed evidence—as  through admissions by the plaintiff following extensive discovery to the effect  that he has discovered nothing.”  (Id.  at p. 855, original emphasis.)             “Supporting and opposing affidavits or declarations . . .  shall set forth admissible evidence.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (d).)  “Matters which would be excluded under the rules of evidence if proffered by a  witness in a trial as hearsay, conclusions or impermissible opinions, must be  disregarded in supporting affidavits.”  (Hayman  v. Block (1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 629, 639.)            In addition, a party moving for summary judgment must support the motion with “a separate statement setting forth  plainly and concisely all material facts which the moving party contends are  undisputed. Each of the material facts stated shall be followed by a reference  to the supporting evidence.” (Parkview Villas Assn. v. State Farm Fire &  Casualty Co. (2006) 133 Cal.App.4th 1197, 1209 (Parkview Villas),  quoting Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (b)(1).)  The party opposing the motion must file with the opposition papers “a separate  statement that responds to each of the material facts contended by the moving  party to be undisputed, indicating whether the opposing party agrees or  disagrees that those facts are undisputed. The statement also shall set forth  plainly and concisely any other material facts that the opposing party contends  are disputed. Each material fact contended by the opposing party to be disputed  shall be followed by a reference to the supporting evidence.” (Code Civ. Proc.,  § 437c, subd. (b)(3).)  If either party  fails to comply with the applicable separate statement requirement, that  failure may in the court’s discretion constitute a sufficient ground to decide  the motion adversely to the offending party. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subds.  (b)(1), (3).)              In ruling on the motion, the court  must consider all the evidence and all the inferences reasonably drawn from it  and must view such evidence and inferences in the light most favorable to the  opposing party.  (Aguilar, supra,  25 Cal.4th at p. 843.)  “[A] court  cannot grant summary judgment based on inferences that are contradicted by  other inferences or evidence. And a triable issue of fact exists when the  evidence permits a reasonable trier of fact to find a contested fact in favor  of the party opposing the motion.   [Citation.] Put slightly differently, a summary judgment may not be  granted unless the evidence is incapable of supporting a judgment for the  losing party.” (California-American Water Co. v. Marina Coast Water Dist.  (2022) 86 Cal.App.5th 1272, 1296.)  B.   Negligence and premises liability  “The elements of a negligence claim and a premises  liability claim are the same: a legal duty of care, breach of that duty, and  proximate cause resulting in injury.” (Kesner v. Superior Court (2016) 1  Cal.5th 1132, 1159.)  DISCUSSION  A.   The first amended complaint  The first  amended complaint alleges the following:  Queen  Arms is a common interest development consisting of eight condominium units and  common areas in Inglewood.  Defendant International Realty & Investments is  a property management company that manages the property.  Steven  Thomas and Shawnda Thomas lived in unit 7 of the development. They engaged in  domestic disputes including a stabbing incident. Thomas threatened other HOA  residents and visitors.  Asrat  lived in unit 3.  Asrat hired Plaintiff, a general contractor, to perform  construction renovations in his condominium unit.  In  October 2018, Steven Thomas threatened to shoot and kill an electrician working  on Asrat’s unit.  On December 12, 2018, Steven Thomas attacked Plaintiff, but  Plaintiff subdued him.  On  January 19, 2019, Steven Thomas shot Plaintiff in the abdomen, injuring him.  B.   Undisputed facts  From  before 2018 through the present, Shawnda Thomas has been the president of the Queen Arms Owners Association Board.  Plaintiff  alleges that on January 19, 2019, Steven Thomas shot him.   At the time of  the incident, Shawnda Thomas and Steven Thomas were co-owners and lived  together in Unit #7 of the property.  Prior  to the incident, Plaintiff visited the property and had several encounters with  Steven Thomas, without incident.  However, Plaintiff alleges that on December  12, 2018, he and Steven Thomas had an altercation when Steven Thomas initiated  a fistfight.  Shawnda  Thomas did not own or possess the public sidewalk where the incident occurred.   She did not maintain, manage, fence in,  repair, or alter the sidewalk where the subject incident occurred and did not  block or restrict public access to the sidewalk.  C.   The summary judgment motion and opposition  “A  defendant's control over property is sufficient to create a duty to protect  owed to persons using the property.” (Colonial Van & Storage, Inc. v.  Superior Court (2022) 76 Cal.App.5th 487, 497 (Colonial Van &  Storage), citing Alcaraz v. Vece (1997) 14 Cal.4th 1149, 1162, 1166;  Soto v. Union Pacific Railroad Co. (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 168, 177 (Soto)  [“the rationale being that whoever has the means to control the property can  take steps to prevent the harm”].) “Conversely, absent any control of the  property, a defendant cannot be held liable for a dangerous condition on that  property.” (Ibid., citing Cody F. v. Falletti (2001) 92  Cal.App.4th 1232, 1241 [“ ‘[t]he law does not impose responsibility where there  is no duty because of the absence of a right to control’ ”]; Soto, supra,  45 Cal.App.5th at p. 177; Vasilenko v. Grace Family Church (2017) 3  Cal.5th 1077, 1084 [generally, there is no right to control another's  property].)  “  ‘In premises liability cases, summary judgment may properly be granted where a  defendant unequivocally establishes its lack of ownership, possession, or  control of the property alleged to be in a dangerous or defective condition.’ ”  (Seaber v. Hotel Del Coronado (1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 481, 487, quoting Gray  v. America West Airlines, Inc. (1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 76, 81; see Rosenbaum  v. Security Pacific Corp. (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1084, 1091 [“California  cases which have considered a property owner's duty in the context of injuries  occurring off the property have imposed liability only if the harm was  foreseeable and the owner controlled the site of the injury [citation],  or affirmatively created a dangerous condition on the site [citation] or if  there was a functional connection between the owner's conduct and the injury  suffered [citation]. None of these factors are present in the case before us”  (original emphasis)].)  Shawnda  Thomas has presented evidence that the shooting occurred on public property  which she did not own, possess, or control. (See Exh. B [Smiley depo.] pp. 80-81,  117; Exh. D [Steven Thomas depo.] p. 19; Exh. E [Shawnda Thomas dec.] ¶¶ 5-7.)  Shawnda Thomas has carried her initial summary  judgment burden on this issue, shifting the burden to Plaintiff.  In  response, Plaintiff argues that Steven Thomas’s deposition testimony  establishes that the shooting occurred while Plaintiff and Asrat were talking  in the entranceway to the driveway going down to the carport of the HOA's  property. (See Plaintiff’s response to UMF 3.) At his deposition, Steven Thomas  testified that he saw Plaintiff talking to Asrat “in the entranceway of the  driveway going down to the carport.” (Steven Thomas depo. p. 18.) Steven Thomas  “had just pulled up and stuff and drove up in [his] car when [he saw]  [Plaintiff].” (Steven Thomas depo. p. 18.) At that point, Steven Thomas did not  have his gun with him. (Steven Thomas depo. p. 19.) Steven Thomas walked up the  stairs to his unit and came back downstairs with his gun. (Steven Thomas depo.  p. 19.) Then “I went -- I was on the sidewalk. I asked [Plaintiff] – you know,  I made a statement to him and stuff and asked him to leave.” (Steven Thomas  depo. p. 19, emphasis added.) Steven Thomas then shot Plaintiff. (David Smiley  depo. pp. 80-81.)          Plaintiff  has failed to raise a triable issue of fact concerning whether Steven Thomas  shot Plaintiff on the public sidewalk next to the HOA’s property.  It is  undisputed that Shawnda Thomas did not own or possess the public sidewalk where  the shooting took place, did not maintain,  manage, fence in, repair, or alter the sidewalk where the incident  occurred, and did not block or restrict public access to the sidewalk.  (UMF 10-11.)  Because Shawnda Thomas did not own, possess,  or control the premises where the shooting took place, Shawnda Thomas did not  owe Plaintiff a duty of care.  The  Court grants the motion.  CONCLUSION  The  Court GRANTS the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Shawnda Thomas.  Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
