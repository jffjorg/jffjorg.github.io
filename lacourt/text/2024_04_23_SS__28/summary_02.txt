The judge's tentative ruling is summarized as follows:

The court grants the motion to compel the plaintiff's mental examination. The court orders the plaintiff to appear for a neuropsychological examination with Dr. Roger Light on May 20 and 21, 2024. The court also denies the defendant's request to limit the scope of the examination and permits the plaintiff to record the entire examination, including the testing portion. The court orders the defendant's examining doctor to release the raw testing data to the plaintiff's counsel subject to a protective order along with the examining doctor's detailed written report within 30 days after the examination.
