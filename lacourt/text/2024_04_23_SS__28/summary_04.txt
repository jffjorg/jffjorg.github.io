Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to produce Shehzad Peermahomed, a former employee of Schueleke, Inc., for deposition testimony. The court finds that the plaintiff has satisfied the statutory requirements for producing a witness who is a prisoner. The court also granted Schueleke's motion to continue the trial and related dates to September 9, 2024, due to the plaintiff's upcoming hip replacement surgery and the need for additional discovery.
