[1] Douglas Kwi Ching
filed an “Opposition to Motion to Compel in Form of Declaration” on July 31,
2024.  As the Court stated in its July
16, 2024 order, he is not a licensed attorney with the State Bar of California
and cannot represent himself or Kathy Kwang Nam Ching as Trustees of the Trust.  Accordingly, the Court orders this
declaration STRICKEN for being filed in violation of law and in violation of
the Court’s July 16, 2024 order.
