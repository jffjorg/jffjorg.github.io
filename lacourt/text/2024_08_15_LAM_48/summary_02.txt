And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendants in a case brought by Maria Eugenia Tapia against the Los Angeles Unified School District, Henry Ponce, and Oscar Pedroza. The plaintiff alleges discrimination, harassment, and retaliation by the defendants, but the judge has sustained the demurrer to the first through eighth causes of action with 30 days' leave to amend. The judge has overruled the demurrer to the ninth cause of action, which alleges failure to permit inspection of personnel and payroll records.

The judge's ruling is based on the plaintiff's failure to plead specific facts to support her claims of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, as well as her failure to allege facts showing that she suffered harm because of her protected status. The judge has also ruled that the defendants did not prevent the plaintiff from reporting her harassment to her supervisor and did not take action to stop the harassment.

The plaintiff has 30 days to amend her complaint to address the issues raised by the demurrer.
