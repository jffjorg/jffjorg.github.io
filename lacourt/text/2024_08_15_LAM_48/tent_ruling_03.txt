  CASE NO.: 23STCV22550
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO
  COMPEL RESPONSES AND MOTIONS TO DEEM RFAs ADMITTED
 
Dept. 48

On
September 18, 2023, Plaintiff Anthony Bouyer filed this action against Defendants
Little Caesar Enterprises Inc., Douglas Kwi Ching (as Trustee of The Douglas Kwi
Ching and Kathy Kwang Nam Ching Revocable Trust Dated 10/19/99), and Kathy Kwang
Nam Ching (as Trustee of The Douglas Kwi Ching and Kathy Kwang Nam Ching Revocable
Trust Dated 10/19/99).  Plaintiff later
dismissed Little Caesar Enterprises Inc.
On
April 15, 2024, Plaintiff served Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special
Interrogatories (Set One), Requests for Production of Documents (Set One), and Requests
for Admissions (Set One) on the Trustee Defendants.
On
July 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed motions to compel responses and to deem the RFAs
admitted.  Each motion also requests
$600.00 in sanctions.
On
August 8, 2024, Plaintiff withdrew the motion to compel Douglas Kwi Ching as
Trustee’s responses to RFPs.
Where
a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may
make an order compelling responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)   A party that
fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including
ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a),
2031.300, subd. (a).)
When
a party fails to timely respond to a request for admission, the propounding
party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(b).)  The party who failed to respond
waives any objections to the demand, unless the court grants them relief from
the waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently served a
substantially compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds.
(a)(1)-(2).)  The court shall grant a
motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the
party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before
the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission
that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
The
Trustee Defendants filed no oppositions to these motions and did not serve
timely responses.[1]  It does not appear that the Trustee Defendants
served substantially compliant responses prior to the hearing.
Accordingly,
the motions are GRANTED.
Both
Trustee Defendants ordered to provide verified responses, without objections,
to Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Special Interrogatories (Set One) no
later than September 16, 2024.
Defendant
Kathy Kwang Nam Ching as Trustee is also ordered to provide verified responses,
without objections, to Requests for Production of Documents (Set One) no later
than September 16, 2024.
The
Requests for Admission (Set One) served on April 15, 2024 are deemed admitted
by both Trustee Defendants.
The
requests for sanctions are granted in part. 
Defendant Douglas Kwi Ching as Trustee is ordered to pay total sanctions
of $1,000.00 to Plaintiff no later than September 16, 2024.  Defendant Kathy Kwang Nam Ching as Trustee is
ordered to pay total sanctions of $1,000.00 to Plaintiff no later than
September 16, 2024.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
