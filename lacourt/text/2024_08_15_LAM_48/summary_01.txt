And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion to vacate the joint stipulation, strike the plaintiff's amended complaint, and compel arbitration. The parties had agreed to lift the arbitration stay and permit the plaintiff to amend his complaint to reinstate class allegations. The defendants argued that the stipulation did not reflect the parties' true material terms of the agreement, citing a misunderstanding about the term "re-allege." However, the court found that the parties' conduct suggested an understanding of the term and that the defendants did not show any mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect that would require striking the joint stipulation. The court also found that the defendants' additional arguments about the statute of limitations and the Federal Arbitration Act were irrelevant at this stage. The parties have agreed to proceed in the judicial forum with respect to the individual claims.
