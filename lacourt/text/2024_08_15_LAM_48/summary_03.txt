And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the plaintiff's motions to compel responses to discovery requests and to deem requests for admissions (RFAs) admitted. The plaintiff had served the discovery requests on the Trustee Defendants, but they failed to serve timely responses. The judge notes that the Trustee Defendants did not file oppositions to the motions and did not serve substantially compliant responses prior to the hearing. As a result, the judge is ordering the Trustee Defendants to provide verified responses to the discovery requests without objections by September 16, 2024. The judge is also deeming the RFAs admitted by both Trustee Defendants. Additionally, the judge is granting the plaintiff's request for sanctions and ordering each Trustee Defendant to pay $1,000.00 to the plaintiff by September 16, 2024.
