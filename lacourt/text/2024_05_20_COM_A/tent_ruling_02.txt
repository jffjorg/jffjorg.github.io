[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING COURT
JUDGMENT (WITH MODIFICATIONS)
 
      
      This
unlawful detainer action arises from the alleged breach of a commercial lease
agreement. Plaintiff alleges Defendant failed to pay rent totaling $36,985.52.
The clerk entered Defendant’s default on January 22, 2024.
      Plaintiff
did not credit the security deposit of $20,583.11, which Plaintiff intends to
retain pending inspection of the premises for wear and tear. (Brenda Joy decl.,
¶ 6.) The landlord of non-residential property must refund the deposit within
30 days after landlord receives possession of the premises. (Civ. Code, § 1950.7 subd. (c).) A landlord in a
commercial lease may not retain the security deposit to cover damages for
future rent; it is applied only against unpaid rent accrued as of the date
required for return of the deposit. (250 L.L.C. v. PhotoPoint Corp. (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 703, 712 [otherwise “landlords could retain
security deposits well beyond the statutory deadline in every case, on the
ground that the deposit ‘might’ not cover prospective damages, and could do so
with relative impunity given the modest penalty for acting in bad faith. Such a
result would thwart the statutory purpose of compelling the prompt refund of
security deposits."].) 
      The
supplemental declaration of Brenda Joy otherwise substantiates back rent owed.
When credited for the amount of security deposit and adding holdover damages, total
damages is $21,333.77.
      Plaintiff
asks for attorney’s fees of $2,207.51 pursuant to Orange County Superior Court
rules. The court applies the fee schedule applicable to default judgments in
actions involving breach of a note, totaling $1,030.01. (CA
R LOS ANGELES SUPER CT Rule 3.214.)
      Accordingly,
the Court enters judgment as follows:
