 DbestProducts, Inc. v. Elite Anywhere Corp.; Robert Sabo; All Unnamed
 Occupants
 

Monday, May 20, 2024, 

 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER: GRANTING REQUEST
FOR COURT JUDGMENT (REDUCED)
 
      This
is an unlawful detainer action based on a written, commercial lease agreement
for a definite term. Defendant, Robert Sabo, signed a personal guaranty. Plaintiff
served a 3-day notice to pay rent or quit. Plaintiff sues for possession, forfeiture
of the lease agreement, past due rent, and holdover damages. 
      The
Court entered default against Elite Anywhere Corporation, a California
Corporation and Robert Sabo on September 7, 2023, and issued a writ of
possession on December 15, 2023, which was returned on February 9, 2024,
showing that possession was returned to Plaintiff. 
Plaintiff
submits a supplemental declaration and accounting showing damages sustained up
to the point of possession (January 17, 2024.) 
      Plaintiff
tacks on “holdover late fees” of $3,500.00 which is not a part of the damage
claim. Damages are broken into two distinct categories, back rent and holdover
damages, the latter of which is the amount of reasonable rental damages the
landlord has suffered. (Superior Motels, Inc. v. Rinn Motor
Hotels, Inc. (1987)
195 Cal.App.3d 1032, 1066.)
Holdover damages are calculated at $486.30 per day for 201 days as alleged in
the Complaint. (Complaint, ¶ 13.)      
      The
landlord of non-residential property must refund the deposit within 30 days
after landlord receives possession of the premises. (Civ. Code, § 1950.7 subd. (c).) Plaintiff did not apply
the security deposit of $21,291.80, claiming that it will be credited “against
any post lock out damages” which is not permitted by statute. A landlord in a
commercial lease may not retain the security deposit to cover damages for
future rent; it is applied only against unpaid rent accrued as of the date
required for return of the deposit. (250 L.L.C. v. PhotoPoint Corp. (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 703, 712 [otherwise “landlords could retain
security deposits well beyond the statutory deadline in every case, on the
ground that the deposit ‘might’ not cover prospective damages, and could do so
with relative impunity given the modest penalty for acting in bad faith. Such a
result would thwart the statutory purpose of compelling the prompt refund of
security deposits."].)

      Plaintiff requests attorney’s fees of $4,169.24
but does not provide any basis for its calculation. The Court calculates
attorney’s fees pursuant to the court’s fee schedule for default matters based
on contract or note, totaling $2,956.33.
      Accordingly, the Court enters judgment as
follows:

$29,178.52

97,746.30
