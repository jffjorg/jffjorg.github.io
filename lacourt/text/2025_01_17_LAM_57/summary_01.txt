And here is the summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions in limine (MIL) filed by Defendant Aziz-Lavi. The Court has granted some of the motions, while denying others. Specifically, the Court has granted MIL #1, which excludes testimony by Plaintiffs' experts regarding any damages caused by Aziz-Lavi and the amount of any such damages. The Court has also granted MIL #5, which allows expert testimony by Ziegler regarding Aziz-Lavi's alleged breach of fiduciary duty.

The Court has denied the following motions: MIL #2, which would have excluded testimony by Plaintiffs' experts regarding any damages caused by Aziz-Lavi and the amount of any such damages; MIL #3, which would have excluded evidence of Plaintiffs' conspiracy claim; MIL #6, which would have excluded evidence regarding the subpoena to Aziz-Lavi and his untimely response; and MIL #7, which would have excluded testimony by Plaintiffs' experts that was not included in their deposition testimony or designations.

The Court has also denied MIL #10, which would have excluded evidence related to the allegation that Aziz-Lavi incorporated Athletix Fabrics for the Hersel parties. The Court has further denied MIL #11, which would have excluded evidence that Aziz-Lavi was a business advisor to the Plaintiffs. The Court has also denied MIL #12, which would have excluded village elder evidence, and MIL #13, which would have excluded evidence regarding any conspiracy engaged in by Aziz-Lavi beyond conspiring to violate Hersel's fiduciary duty.
