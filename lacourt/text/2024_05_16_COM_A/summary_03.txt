And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court denies Honda's motion to compel arbitration in this case. Honda argues that the plaintiff is bound by the arbitration provision in the sales contract and that the court should stay the action pending arbitration. However, the court finds that Honda is not a signatory to the sales contract and therefore does not have the power to elect arbitration. The court also finds that the plaintiff's claims are not intertwined with the sales contract and therefore equitable estoppel does not apply. The court concludes that Honda's motion to compel arbitration is denied.
