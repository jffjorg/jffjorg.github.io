[TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING
DEMURRER TO THE FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT WITH LEAVE TO AMEND
 
I.       
BACKGROUND
      This
action arises from the alleged mishandling of Plaintiffs’ uninsured motorist
claim by Plaintiffs’ insurer, Defendant, Progressive Insurance (“Progressive”).
The verified first amended complaint (“(FAC, ¶”) alleges that Progressive
issued an insurance policy to Plaintiff providing full coverage of Plaintiffs’
Maserati, including coverage for damages caused by uninsured motorists. 
      Plaintiffs
allege that an unidentified driver caused an auto accident resulting in
personal injuries and property damage. Plaintiffs made an insurance claim with
Defendant who allegedly “lowballed” offers for Plaintiffs’ damage claim.
Plaintiffs allege claims against Progressive for (1) breach of contract, (2)
fraud, (3) unfair competition, and (4) bad faith denial of an insurance claim.
The sixth cause of action for negligence is alleged against the unknown driver.
(A fifth cause of action is omitted.)      
II.     
ARGUMENTS
      Progressive
demurs to all four causes of action alleged against it on grounds the claims
are barred by the statute of limitations. Plaintiffs did not allege
satisfaction of conditions precedent to filing a lawsuit against their insurer,
the fraud claim is not alleged with specificity, Plaintiffs are not entitled to
damages for violation of the Unfair Competition Law (“UCL”) under Business &
Professions Code, section 17200), and Plaintiffs did not allege facts to
support Plaintiff, Verni L. Franklin, Jr.’s (“Franklin”) standing to sue.
      In
opposition, Plaintiffs argue that there is no statute of limitations issue, each
claim is adequately alleged, and Plaintiffs are entitled to damages. The bad
faith insurance claim arises from the breach of the insurance contract. Alternatively,
Plaintiffs ask for leave to amend.
      In
reply, Progressive argues that Plaintiffs have not addressed any of the issues
raised by the demurrer.        
 
 
III.   
LEGAL STANDARDS
      The
bases for demurrer are limited by statute and may be sustained for reasons including
failure to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action and uncertainty. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.10.) A demurrer “tests the sufficiency
of a complaint as a matter of law and raises only questions of law.” (Schmidt
v. Foundation Health (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)
The court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The court may not
consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. (Moore
v. Conliffe (1994) 7 Cal.4th 634, 638.)    
IV.   
DISCUSSION
A.     
Plaintiffs have not alleged that they complied
with conditions precedent to filing suit against the insurer.
      To sustain demurrer on grounds of the statute of limitations, “the defect
must clearly and affirmatively appear on the face of the complaint; it is not
enough that the complaint shows that the action may be barred." (Marshall v. Gibson, Dunn &
Crutcher (1995) 37
Cal.App.4th 1397, 1398.)
      Uninsured motorist coverage is governed by
Insurance Code, section 11580.2. The insured’s claims do not accrue unless, within
two  years from the date of accident, the
insured files suit against the uninsured motorist, the amount due under the
policy has been agreed upon, the insured formally instituted arbitration
proceedings. (Ins. Code, § 11580.2 subd. (i)(1).)
      These are conditions precedent to asserting
a claim against the insurer, otherwise, the insured’s rights under the policy
are waived. (Pacific
Indem. Co. v. Superior Court In and For City and County of San Francisco (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 63, 67 [“It appears to be the legislative intent that
compliance with subdivision (h) [former subdivision (i)] is a condition
precedent to arbitration as well as to the enforcement of any other right under
the policy. Failure to act within this time limit constitutes a waiver of the
right to arbitrate, and such waiver may be determined by a court whose
jurisdiction is invoked for that purpose.”].) This provision has been construed
as a statute of limitations. (Pacific
Indem. Co. v. Superior Court In and For City and County of San Francisco (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 63, 67.) Plaintiffs have not alleged facts to support
that their claims against Progressive have accrued. 
      Plaintiffs commenced this action on
February 2, 2023, alleging contract-based claims and fraud against Progressive
only. While Plaintiffs alleged that an unidentified driver caused the accident,
Plaintiffs did not allege claims against the driver until filing the FAC on March
8, 2024, wherein Plaintiffs alleged a sixth cause of action for negligence
against the driver. The accident occurred on January 30, 2021, but Plaintiffs
filed this action on February 2, 2023, outside of the two-year period. (FAC, ¶
14.) 
      The statute also provides that Plaintiffs’
claims have not accrued unless, within two years, an “agreement as to the
amount due has been concluded.” (Ins. Code, § 11580.2 subd., (h)(2)(i)(1)(B.) The pleading suggests that
the parties have engaged in efforts to settle the claim, but when that
conversation occurred is not alleged. (FAC, ¶ 19 [Progressive has “contacted
Plaintiffs with lowball offers for the damages sustained.”].)  Nor have Plaintiffs alleged that they  demanded arbitration within two years of the date
of accident. Absent any factual allegations demonstrating that Plaintiffs’
claims have accrued, the FAC is defective.
 
B.     
The fraud
claim is not alleged with specificity.
      A claim for fraud
requires facts to support the following elements: (1) a misrepresentation, (2)
made with knowledge of its falsity, (3) Defendant intended to defraud
Plaintiff, i.e., induce Plaintiff’s reliance, (4) Plaintiff justifiably relied
on the misrepresentation, (5) causing damage. (Nagy v. Nagy (1989) 210
Cal.App.3d 1262, 1268.) Fraud claims are subject to
strict requirements of particularity in pleading. (Id.) The
particularity requirements necessitate pleading facts showing “how, when,
where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered." (Stansfield
v. Starkey (1990) 220
Cal.App.3d 59, 73.) The requirement “applies not only to the alleged
misrepresentation, but also to the elements of causation and damage." (Moncada
v. West Coast Quartz Corp. (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 768, 776.)

      Where fraud is alleged against a
corporation, the pleading standards are even greater. Plaintiff must allege
“the names of the persons who made the allegedly fraudulent representations,
their authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when
it was said or written." (Lazar
v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal. 4th 631, 645.)
      Plaintiffs allege the claim against
Progressive in general terms and without the detail required by Lazar. (FAC, ¶¶ 32-41.)The alleged misrepresentation was
the policy provision requiring Progressive to indemnify Plaintiffs for
accidents and provide “reasonable” offers  (FAC, ¶ 33.). Plaintiffs allege that
Progressive extended “reasonable” offers to induce Plaintiffs to sign the
policy. (FAC, ¶ 32.) These are conclusory facts without the required
specificity. 
 
C.     
The claim
for unfair competition is not well-stated. 
      The UCL
claim alleged here is predicated on the allegations that Defendant breached its
contract and made fraudulent misrepresentations. Plaintiffs have “tethered” the
unlawful practice to Defendants’ common law and statutory violations; the claim
is adequately alleged. (Gutierrez
v. CarMax Superstores (2018) 19 Cal. App. 5th 1234, 1265, ["Virtually
any statute or regulation (federal or state) can serve as a predicate for a UCL
unlawful practice cause of action."].) The UCL is stated in the
disjunctive; plaintiff need only allege a claim that is unlawful, unfair, or
fraudulent. Under Section 17200, a practice is prohibited as ‘unfair’ or
‘deceptive’ even if not ‘unlawful’ and vice versa.” (Cel-Tech
Communications Inc., v. Los Angeles Celluar Telephone Co. (1999) 20
Cal. App. 4th 163, 180.)  The UCL claim is “tethered” to the underlying
claims which are also defective as previously discussed. 

      Additionally, Plaintiffs pray for cosmetic
and financial damages arising from Progressive’s unlawful practices. (FAC, ¶ 51.)
A claim under the UCL “is a separate equitable cause of action and only restitution
and injunctive relief are available”; damages are not available. (Hodge
v. Superior Court (2006) 145
Cal.App.4th 278, 284.)
D.    
The fourth
cause of action for insurance bad faith is also defective. 
      The prerequisite for any action for
breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is the existence
of a contractual relationship between the parties, since the covenant is an
implied term in the contract." (Smith
v. City and County of San Francisco (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 38, 49.)  Secondly, benefits due been withheld, and the
reason for withholding benefits must have been unreasonable or without proper
cause.” (Love
v. Fire Ins. Exchange (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1151.)
      While
the existence of a contractual relationship is alleged, Plaintiffs have not
demonstrated that they have complied with the requirements of the Insurance
Code to satisfy conditions precedent to filing suit against the insured as
previously discussed.  
E.     
Plaintiff, Verni Franklin, has not alleged facts
to support her standing to sue Progressive.
The issue of a person’s standing to
sue is properly raised at the demurrer stage. (Buckland
v. Threshold Enterprises, Ltd. (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 798, 813.) Plaintiffs allege that Plaintiff Diaz entered into
an insurance contract with Progressive. The breach of contractual and other
duties are allegedly owed to Diaz not to Franklin. (FAC, ¶¶ 12-13, 25, 32, 51, 66.)

 
V.     
CONCLUSION
      Leave to amend is proper where the
plaintiff has not had a fair opportunity to amend, and the defect (although
substantive) is capable of being cured. (Colvig v. RKO
General, Inc. (1965) 232 Cal.App.2d 56, 69–70.)
Accordingly, Defendant’s demurer to the First Amended Complaint is SUSTAINED
with 10 days leave to amend.
