Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer to the first amended complaint with leave to amend. The court finds that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the statute of limitations. The plaintiff has not alleged that they complied with the conditions precedent to filing suit against the insurer. The court also finds that the fraud claim is not alleged with specificity, the claim for unfair competition is not well-stated, and the fourth cause of action for insurance bad faith is defective. Additionally, the court finds that the plaintiff, Verni Franklin, has not alleged facts to support her standing to sue. The court grants the defendant 10 days' leave to amend the complaint.
