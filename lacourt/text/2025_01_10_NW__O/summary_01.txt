And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies Nabi Youssef Associates' (NYA) motion for reconsideration of the court's November 25, 2024, order sustaining WPIC Construction, LLC's demurrer to NYA's cross-complaint. NYA argues that it was not provided a fair opportunity to amend its cross-complaint and that it has added new facts and allegations that require factual findings and evidence. The court finds that NYA has not provided new or different facts, circumstances, or law to support its motion and that it did not act with reasonable diligence in finding or producing new facts or evidence. The court also finds that NYA's proposed new allegations are simply legal arguments that were available at the time of the original hearing and not new facts. Therefore, the court denies NYA's motion for reconsideration.
