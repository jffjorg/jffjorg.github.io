And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the motion for an order setting the scope of trial. The judge believes that the best use of the court's time would be to focus on the two probate cases and the quiet title action in September, but not the elder abuse case. The judge reasons that the issues in the elder abuse case overlap with the Utah court's findings and that the appeal in Utah has not concluded, so it is not possible to try the case at the same time. The judge also believes that the trial would exceed the allotted time and that witnesses would have to testify remotely. The judge will hear any motion for claim or issue preclusion arising from the Utah elder abuse case and will set a trial date in the elder abuse case once the appeal in Utah is concluded.
