Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has reviewed the proposed settlements and finds them to be fair and reasonable. The proposed settlements involve two minors, Alexia and Genesis Lopez, who have agreed to settle their claims against the defendants, Leonidas, Dolores, and Rafael Ramirez, in exchange for $70,000.00 and $35,000.00, respectively. The Court finds that the attorney fees, which are 40% of the funds, are fair and reasonable. The proposed settlements are conditioned on the deposit of the funds into blocked accounts, which will be subject to withdrawal only upon authorization of the Court. The Court grants the petitions to approve the minor's compromise and sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Proof of Deposit Into Blocked Accounts for September 6, 2024.
