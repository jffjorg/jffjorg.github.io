And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants in part the motion to compel further responses. The Defendant, Downey Unified School District, is ordered to produce certain documents related to K.G., a student who allegedly assaulted the Plaintiff, Jane Doe L.P. The documents to be produced include K.G.'s student profile, enrollment history, class schedule, entry into special education program, IEP/504 Triennial Plans, behavioral and psychosocial reports, and disciplinary records. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant failed to supervise K.G. and breached its duty to properly supervise K.G. The Court finds that the Defendant's limitation to K.G.'s student profile, enrollment/attendance history, entry into special education program, and September 2019 IEP is too narrow. The motion to compel further responses is granted in part, and the Defendant is ordered to produce the requested documents within 30 days.
