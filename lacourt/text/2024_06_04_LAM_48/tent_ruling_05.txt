  CASE NO.: 23STCV11392
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT THE
  WALT DISNEY COMPANY’S MOTION TO DECLARE VEXATIOUS LITIGANT 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
June 4, 2024



 
On May 8, 2024, Defendant
the Walt Disney Company’s filed the Motion to Declare Dylan Scott Perry a
Vexatious Litigant. On May 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed his opposition. On May 28,
2024, Defendant filed the reply.  
The
Walt Disney Company (erroneously named as “d.b.a. Twentieth Century Studios”)
moves the Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 391 et seq. for an
Order designating Plaintiff Dylan Scott Perry a “vexatious litigant” under Code
of Civil Procedure sections 391 et seq. and entering a pre-filing order
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 391.7 that prohibits Perry from
filing any new litigation in the courts of California in propria persona
without first obtaining leave of the presiding justice or presiding judge of
the court where there the litigation is proposed to be filed. 
Section
391.7 allows courts to take preemptive action to curb future litigation abuse
by a vexatious litigant. Code Civ. Proc. § 391.7. The Court, on its own motion
or the motion of a party, may enter a pre-filing order that prohibits a
vexatious litigant from filing new litigation without the prior authorization
of the presiding justice or judge of the court in which the litigation is
proposed to be filed. Id. § 391.7(a). A vexatious litigant subject to a
prefiling order may only bring suit by employing a lawyer, or by proceeding pro
se and demonstrating to the presiding judge or justice of the relevant court
that the proposed “litigation has merit and has not been filed for the purposes
of harassment or delay.” Id. § 391.7(b); see also Bravo, 99 Cal.
App. 4th at 221. Code of Civil Procedure section 391(b) defines a “vexatious
litigant” as a pro se litigant who, among other things, “repeatedly files
unmeritorious papers or engages in other frivolous litigation tactics.” Code
Civ. Proc. § 391(b)(3).
Here,
Perry filed a nearly identical complaint in a new action (23STCP01900) on June
1, 2023. Defendant filed demurrers to Perry’s complaints in both cases on June
23, 2023. While those demurrers were pending, Perry filed a third complaint in
a third case (23STCV15449, filed July 10, 2023). That complaint alleged the
same basic conduct that Perry had previously alleged in his prior two cases and
sought $1 billion in monetary relief to be able to afford security, including
“electric fences, razor wire, top of the line security, attack dogs, a moat,
alligators, a drawbridge, nuclear defenses, anti-air missiles, and to hire 4 or
more Mercenaries wielding M16s to secure the perimeter of my home.” (23STCV15449
Compl. at p. 4.) Defendant filed a demurrer to this complaint on September 8,
2023. At
the May 7, 2024, hearing on Defendant’s demurrers, Perry sought leave to file
an amended complaint that would “no longer alleg[e] anything” and would instead
seek declaratory relief in the form of answers to 25 questions. (Payne Decl. ¶¶
2–3 & Ex. A; see also Payne Decl. ¶ 4 & Ex. D.) At the same hearing,
Perry insisted that he needed certain information from Defendant before he
could “file articles of impeachment with congress.” (Payne Decl. ¶ 3.) 
On
May 7, 2024, this Court sustained all three demurrers without leave to amend.
Defendant’s counsel also submitted an additional supplemental declaration where
he states that after filing the instant motion, he was threatened by Plaintiff.
(Payne Decl. ¶ 3.) Plaintiff’s one-line opposition was “Penis boner banana.” (Opp’n
at p.2.) 
Accordingly,
the motion to declare Plaintiff Dylan Scott Perry a vexatious litigant is GRANTED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit.  If all parties in the case submit on the
tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are required unless a
companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference) is also on
calendar.
