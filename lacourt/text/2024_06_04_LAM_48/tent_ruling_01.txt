Claimant
Genesis Lopez, a minor, by and through her parent and guardian ad litem, Sonia Calderon,
has agreed to settle her claims against Defendants Leonidas Ramirez, Dolores Ramirez,
and Rafael Ramirez in exchange for $35,000.00. 
Of this amount, $122.28 is allocated for reimbursement of medical expenses
to Medi-Cal and $14,000.00 is allocated for attorney fees, leaving a balance of
$20,877.72 for Claimant.  If approved, the

authorization of the court.
Court
approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code
Civ. Proc. § 372.)  The Court has reviewed
the proposed settlement and finds that it is fair and reasonable.  The Court also finds that the attorney fees, which
are 40% of the funds, are fair and reasonable. 
Additionally, they were agreed to by the parent and guardian ad litem.
Accordingly,
the Petitions to Approve Minor’s Compromise are GRANTED.  The Court sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Proof
of Deposit Into Blocked Accounts for September 6, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.  (California Rules of Court, rule 7.953(a).)  If acknowledgements of receipt by the financial
institution are filed before that date, no appearance will be required.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
