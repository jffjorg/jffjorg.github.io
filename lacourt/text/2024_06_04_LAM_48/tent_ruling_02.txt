[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING IN PART MOTION
  TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
June 4, 2024



 
On December 11, 2023, Plaintiff
Jane Doe L.P. served a Notice of Taking Deposition of Defendant Downey Unified School
District’s Person Most Knowledgeable and Fact Witness Principal Tom Houts and Request
for Production of Documents (“RFPs”) on Defendant Downey Unified School District.  On February 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion
to compel further responses to RFP No. 4.
At
the March 19, 2024, hearing, the Court found that some information about K.G., such
as that related to Defendant’s knowledge of his prior similar misconduct and need
for supervision, may be relevant.  However,
the Court found that RFP No. 4 was overbroad. 
The Court also noted that the request infringed on K.G.’s privacy rights
without giving him notice before the disclosure.  Accordingly, the Court continued the hearing,
ordered the parties to meet and confer about the scope of RFP No. 4, and ordered
Defendant to provide K.G.’s guardian’s last known address and phone number to Plaintiff
so that Plaintiff could provide notice of the motion and the continued hearing date.
On
May 3, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel filed a supplemental declaration.  Plaintiff has served K.G.’s guardian with notice
of the motion via U.S. mail and email.  (Baldermann
Suppl. Decl. ¶ 13 & Ex. 13.)  Since the
last hearing, Plaintiff and Defendant have been discussing the scope of RFP No.
4.  (Baldermann Suppl. Decl. ¶¶ 6-10.)  However, from April 18, 2024 through May 1, 2024,
Defendant’s counsel stopped responding to Plaintiff’s counsel.  (Baldermann Suppl. Decl. ¶ 11.)
As
propounded, RFP No. 4 requests “Any and all SCHOOL RECORDS in YOUR possession, custody
or control for K.G.”  “SCHOOL RECORDS” is
defined as “any and all written notes, memos, reports, or other writings regarding
a student including but not limited to report cards, progress reports, letters,
notes, nurses’ notes, attendance records, health records, incident reports, IEP
reports, correspondence, class schedules, or any other written material having anything
whatsoever to do with the student in YOUR possession, custody or control.”
Defendant’s
last specific offer (March 26, 2024) was for K.G.’s “student profile, enrollment
history, attendance history, entry into the special education program dates, and
the September 2019 IEP outlining the supervision/services that his IEP called for
at the time of the incident.”  (Baldermann
Suppl. Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. 7.)
Plaintiff’s
last request (April 25, 2024) was for “K.G.’s student profile, enrollment history,
class schedule for the 2019-2020 school year, entry into the special education program
dates, IEP/504 Triennial Plans for the time period of August 1, 2012 - December
6, 2019, behavioral and psychosocial reports up until December 6, 2019, Disciplinary
Records from August 1, 2012 - December 6, 2019, if any, which shall include written/recording
verbal warnings, written warnings, incident reports, suspensions, detentions, complaints
regarding behavioral issues and incidents, reprimands, and any similar admonishments
of inappropriate behavior demonstrated by K.G.” 
(Baldermann Suppl. Decl. ¶ 10 & Ex. 11.)
Plaintiff
alleges that on December 6, 2019, her 1-on-l aide abandoned her, resulting in Plaintiff
being assaulted by K.G.  (Complaint ¶ 22.)  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant “negligently
failed to carry out its duties to properly and adequately supervise Plaintiff L.P.”
and “failed to discipline, investigate, warn, appropriately supervise, or suspend
[K.G.] despite having actual or constructive knowledge that he had engaged in inappropriate
conduct with other minor student.”  (Complaint
¶¶ 23, 46.)  “California courts have long
recognized that a student may recover for injuries proximately caused by a breach
of [a school’s] duty to supervise.”  (M.
W. v. Panama Buena Vista Union School Dist. (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 508, 518.)  “The existence of a duty of care of a school district
toward a student depends, in part, on whether the particular harm to the student
is reasonably foreseeable.”  (Ibid.)  The harm may be foreseeable when the alleged perpetrator
was repeatedly disciplined for “grave acts of defiance and inappropriate and violent
behavior.”  (Id. at p. 520.)  Accordingly, Defendant’s limitation to K.G.’s
student profile, enrollment/attendance history, entry into the special education
program, and the September 2019 IEP is too narrow.
Defendant
did not file any supplemental information, and K.G.’s guardian did not file any
objections.
The
motion to compel further is GRANTED IN PART.
Defendant
is ordered to respond to RFP No. 4 by producing the following documents to Plaintiff
within 30 days:  K.G.’s student profile; enrollment
history; class schedule for the 2019-2020 school year; dates of entry into the special
education program; IEP/504 Triennial Plans for the time period of August 1, 2012
to December 6, 2019; behavioral and psychosocial reports up until December 6, 2019;
and Disciplinary Records from August 1, 2012 to December 6, 2019, if any, including
written/recording verbal warnings, written warnings, incident reports, suspensions,
detentions, complaints regarding behavioral issues and incidents, reprimands, and
any similar admonishments of inappropriate behavior demonstrated by K.G.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
