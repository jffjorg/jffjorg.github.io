And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the petition to change name, but with certain conditions. The Petitioner must review the proposed decree and ensure that the new name is clear and correctly spelled. If the Petitioner is satisfied with the proposed decree, they do not need to appear at the hearing. However, if the new name is not clearly written or correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the date of the hearing. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
