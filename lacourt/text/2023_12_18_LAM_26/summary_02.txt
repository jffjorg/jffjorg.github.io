And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling concerns a petition to change the name of the Petitioner. The Judge has reviewed the proposed decree and requires the Petitioner to double-check the spelling and legibility of the new name. If the Petitioner is satisfied with the spelling and legibility of the new name, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled on the proposed decree, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The petition is granted, and a copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the date of the hearing. Once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
