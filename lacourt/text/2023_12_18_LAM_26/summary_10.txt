This tentative ruling from the judge addresses a petition for a change of name. The judge grants the petition, but notes that the petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the name is satisfactory, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the name is not clearly written or correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A signed copy of the decree will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing.
