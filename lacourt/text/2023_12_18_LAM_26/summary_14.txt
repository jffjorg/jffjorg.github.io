The judge's tentative ruling grants the petition and outlines the next steps. The Petitioner must double-check the spelling and legibility of the new name on the proposed decree. If the name is correct, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
