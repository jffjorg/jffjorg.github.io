And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the petition for a name change, but with certain conditions. The petitioner must ensure that the new name on the proposed decree is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the new name meets these criteria, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the new name is not legible or correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
