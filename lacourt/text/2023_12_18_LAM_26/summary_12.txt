And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the petition to change name is granted. The Petitioner must ensure that the new name on the proposed decree is correctly spelled and legible. If the Petitioner is satisfied with the new name, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
