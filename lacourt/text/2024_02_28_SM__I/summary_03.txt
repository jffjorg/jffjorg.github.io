And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering two motions: a motion to be relieved as counsel and an OSC re: Sanctions. However, the defendant has recently filed for bankruptcy in New York and the court has not seen the notice of bankruptcy stay or the order lifting the stay. The court is requesting that defense counsel repeat their statements under oath to establish jurisdiction. Assuming this is done, the court intends to grant the motion to be relieved as counsel and discharge the OSC re: Sanctions, as the court lacks jurisdiction to consider it.
