 Case Number:  23SMCV01468    Hearing Date:   February 28, 2024    Dept:  I The motion to quash is MOOT because the moving party has
been dismissed.  The court will hold the
CMC as to the remainder of the case.  The
court notes that there are four discovery motions set for May.  There are reservations for all of them, but
only the notice of motion has been filed. 
There are no supporting memoranda or other papers.  This strikes the court as a prophylactic
reservation, which the court disfavors. 
Therefore, the motions are STRICKEN (because they must be accompanied by
the supporting papers), as are the reservation dates.  The court notes that it hears motions on 4-6
weeks’ notice, so it ought not be necessary to reserve dates “just in
case.”
