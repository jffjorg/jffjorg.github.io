And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is to grant the application to continue the trial due to a conflict with the lead counsel for the defense, who is engaged in a trial in Orange County. The Judge believes it is not reasonable to expect counsel to be in two places at once and does not want to deprive the defendants of their lead counsel. The Judge will discuss a new trial date and order all counsel to be available for that date. The deadlines for summary judgment and adjudication remain tied to the original trial date, and the FSC and trial dates are vacated.
