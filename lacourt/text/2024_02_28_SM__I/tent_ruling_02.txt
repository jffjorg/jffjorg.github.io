 Case Number:  20STCV39460    Hearing Date:   February 28, 2024    Dept:  I The court will GRANT the application to continue the
trial.  Lead counsel for the defense is
actually engaged in trial in Orange County. 
The court cannot compel counsel to be in two places at once, nor does
the court believe it should deprive defendants of their lead counsel.  The court will discuss when it has some
availability to re-set the matter for trial. 
The court will order all counsel to not be otherwise engaged for the new
date.  The various deadlines, including
summary judgment and adjudication, remain tied to the prior trial date,
however.  Nothing re-opens.  This continuance is for convenience of
counsel only due to the conflict.
The court reminds all parties that they will need to comply
with the court’s FSC and trial orders, which can be found on line.
In the meantime, the FSC and Trial dates are VACATED.
