And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case alleging fraud and violation of the Unfair Competition Law (UCL) against General Motors (GM). The defendant has demurred to the fourth and fifth causes of action, alleging that there is no fraud and no UCL violation. The judge has not been persuaded by most of the claims. The key issue is whether the dealer acted as GM's agent, and the court has decided to await the outcome of a pending California Supreme Court case before resolving this issue. The court has also decided to continue the matter for 60 days to see what the Supreme Court decides and whether an argument date is set.
