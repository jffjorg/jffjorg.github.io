And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling states that the motion to quash is moot due to the moving party being dismissed. The court will hold a Case Management Conference (CMC) to manage the remaining aspects of the case. The court notes that there are four discovery motions set for May, but only the notice of motion has been filed, without supporting memoranda or other papers. The court disfavors "prophylactic reservations" and therefore strikes the motions and their reserved dates. The court suggests that motions can be heard on 4-6 weeks' notice, making reservations unnecessary.
