  Case Number:  24STCV10339    Hearing Date:   June 21, 2024    Dept:  82 D.A. BEEC–007, LLC v. Eric Liu, et al.
Case No. 24STCV10339
Order to Show Cause re: Preliminary Injunction
 
Plaintiff
D.A. BEEC–007,
LLC (“Plaintiff”) seeks a preliminary injunction
enjoining Defendants Eric Liu, Lin Dee Liu, Yu Sheng Victor Liu, and Building
Futures Foundation (collectively, “Defendants”) from proceeding with a
foreclosure of 2637 Third Street in Santa Monica, California 90405 (the
“Property”).  The parties stipulated to a
temporary restraining order.  (See
Court’s Minute Order, dated April 30, 2024.) 
Now, Plaintiff seeks a preliminary injunction.
 
            According to Defendants’ counsel,
Plaintiff has declared bankruptcy and therefore the senior foreclosure has not
occurred.  (Sahae Decl., ¶ 2.)  In fact, on June 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Chapter
11 bankruptcy petition in the Central District of California, which is Case
Number 24-BK-14433-WB.  Plaintiff has not
obtained relief from the automatic stay in order to pursue this action.  Nor did Plaintiff file a notice informing the
court of the automatic stay.     
 
            Based upon the foregoing, the court
orders as follows:
 
            1.         The
court discharges the order to show cause re: preliminary injunction.  
 
            2.         The
court orders that this case shall be stayed pending resolution of Plaintiff’s
bankruptcy.    
 
            3.         The
court advances and vacates the case management conference currently set for
August 26, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 51.
 
            4.         The
court issues an Order to Show Cause why the stay should not be lifted.  The hearing shall be held in Department 51 on
December 10, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
 
            5.         Plaintiff’s
counsel shall file a status report concerning the status of the bankruptcy case
on or before December 2, 2024.
 
            6.         After
the stay is lifted, if necessary, Plaintiff may file a noticed motion for a
preliminary injunction in the home court, per Local Rule 2.8, which
states that a “[n]oticed motion for a preliminary injunction, whenever made”
shall be heard in the “[d]epartment where [the] case is assigned.”  
 
            7.         The
court’s clerk shall provide notice.
