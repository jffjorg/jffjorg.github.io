And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the application for a writ of possession filed by VW Credit Leasing Ltd. (Plaintiff) against Gary Williams and Ronald Martinez (Defendants). The Plaintiff seeks to repossess a 2021 Volkswagen Jetta (Vehicle) that was transferred to LA's Bestway Towing Service (Body Shop) after Ronald Martinez defaulted on the vehicle lease contract.

The judge has denied the application for a writ of possession against Ronald Martinez because the Plaintiff has not served him with the necessary documents. However, the judge has granted the application for a writ of possession against Gary Williams, individually and doing business as LA's Bestway Towing Service, because the Plaintiff has established the probable validity of its claim and the wrongfulness of the detention of the Vehicle.

The judge has also ruled that the Plaintiff does not need to post an undertaking because LA's Bestway Towing Service has no claim against the Plaintiff. The judge has ordered the Plaintiff to provide notice and file proof of service with the court. Finally, the judge has noted that the Plaintiff may seek up to $1,750 in attorneys' fees if it prevails in the case, but the Plaintiff is not yet the prevailing party.
