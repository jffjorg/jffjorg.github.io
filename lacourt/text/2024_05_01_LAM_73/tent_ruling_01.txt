his guardian ad litem Seschwana Costello; and Iriii Costello Stevens, a minor

and electrical wiring damage. (Compl., ¶ 13.) The Complaint alleges the

Breach of Contract
2.    
Breach of Implied Warranty of
Habitability 
3.    
Nuisance
4.    
Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress
5.

On
March 6, 2023, the TRN Law Group filed this Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel.
It also filed a supporting declaration and proposed order.  
 
Defendants
have not filed an opposition. 
 
II.DISCUSSION
 
A.     Legal
Standard
 
California
Rules¿of Court,¿rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1)
notice of motion and motion to be directed to the client (made on the Notice of
Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil¿form (MC-051)); (2) a
declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under
Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of
Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil¿form (MC-052)); (3) service
of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who
have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel
(prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil¿form (MC-053)).¿ 
 
The¿court has discretion
to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted¿provided
that¿there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly
process of justice.¿¿(See¿Ramirez v.¿Sturdevant¿(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th
904, 915.)¿ 
 
B.     Application
Here,
Plaintiffs’ attorney, Tanner Nielsen and the TRN Law Group, seek relief under
Code of Civil Procedure, Section 284(2). Mr. Nielsen correctly completed and
filed the notice (Form MC-051) and declaration (MC-052). (Code Civ. Proc., §
284(2); Cal. Rules Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a) & (c).) In the
declaration Mr. Nielsen sufficiently explains that this motion is being brought
under Section 284(2) instead of 284(1) because Ms. Costello did not voluntarily
consent to counsel’s request to be relieved and there has been a breakdown in
the attorney/client relationship. Mr. Nielsen states that Ms. Costello is
failing to communicate or respond to her counsel despite their attempt to get
in contact with her via letters, emails and phone calls.  
Mr.
Nielsen served the notice (MC-051), the declaration (MC-052), and the proposed
order (MC-053) on Plaintiffs and filed a Proof of Service with the Court. 
Mr.
Nielsen has completed all the requirements for relief. Additionally, trial has
not been scheduled in this case and Plaintiffs have a reasonable amount of time
to obtain new counsel, such that they should not be prejudiced by the TRN
Law Group’s withdrawal.
III. CONCLUSION 
 
The
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is granted.
