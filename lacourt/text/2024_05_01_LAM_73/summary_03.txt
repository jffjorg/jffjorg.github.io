```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge sustains the demurrer as to each of the Plaintiff's causes of action with 20 days leave to amend. The demurrer was filed by the Defendants, arguing that the Plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with CalPERS. The Plaintiff argues that he had no duty to exhaust administrative remedies before suing Anthem, but the judge disagrees. The judge finds that the express terms of the plan require exhaustion prior to filing suit. The Plaintiff's reliance on Mintz v. Blue Cross of California is unpersuasive, as the court noted that a member has to exhaust the Blue Cross and CalPERS appeal process before appealing to the courts. The judge also finds that the language of the Evidence of Coverage indicates that members have the option of appealing the denial, but not the option to forego the appeal and file a civil action instead.
