TENTATIVE RULING 
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for
Interlocutory Judgement of Partition by Sale and Appointment of Partition
Referee is GRANTED.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On June 1, 2023,
Plaintiff Sundo Hong (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendant Sun
Be Hong (“Defendant”). 
 
This is an
action for partition by sale of the commercial property at 6840 S. Crenshaw
Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90043, held equally as joint tenants by Plaintiff and
Defendant. (FAC, ¶ 1.) Plaintiff
alleges Defendant refused to voluntarily sell the real property in question or
buy out the share of Plaintiff’s interest. (Ibid.)
 
On
March 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed this Motion for Interlocutory Judgment of
Partition by Sale and Appointment of Partition Referee.  
 
Defendant
has not filed an opposition. 
 
II.DISCUSSION
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 873.010,
subdivision (a) states “[t]he court shall appoint a referee to divide or
sell the property as ordered by the court” in a partition proceeding. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 873.010, subd. (a) (emphasis added).) Under
California law, “ordinarily, if the party seeking partition is shown to be a
tenant in common, and as such entitled to the possession of the land sought to
be partitioned, the right is absolute.” (Bacon v. Wahrhaftig (1950) 97
Cal.App.2d 599, 603, quoting Priddel v. Shankie (1945) 69 Cal.App.2d
319, 325. See also CCP § 872.710(b) (“partition as to concurrent interests in
the property shall be as of right”).) 
 
The
procedure of a partition actions is as follows: (1) determine whether the
plaintiff has an interest in the property sufficient to maintain a partition
action (CCP § 872.710); (2) determine whether the plaintiff has waived her
right to partition (CCP § 872.710(b)); (3) entry of an interlocutory judgment
of partition (CCP § 872.720(a)) and determination of the manner of partition;
(4) appointment of a referee to divide or sell the property (CCP § 873.010(a));
(5) the referee sells the property (CCP §§ 873.670, 873.680); and (6) the
referee delivers a report and the Court confirms the sale (CCP §§ 873.710,
873.720(b), 873.730(a) and 873.790(a)). 
 
Plaintiff
and Defendant each have 50% interest in the property. (Illoulian Decl., ¶ 4,
Ex. 3, pp. 2-3) Therefore, Plaintiff has a sufficient interest in the property
to maintain a partition action. Additionally, there is no indication that either
party has waived their right to petition the property. (Motion, p. 4.)
 
The
Court does not see any reason to not enter an interlocutory judgment of
partition. Defendant has not filed an opposition to Plaintiff’s motion.
Further, since the property is a commercial property on a single lot, partition
in kind (physical division) of the property is not possible and partition by
sale would be the best method by which to divide the property in this case.  
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s motion for interlocutory judgment of partition is granted. Brandon
J. Anand is appointed as referee for the sale of the property.
 
III. CONCLUSION 
 
Plaintiff’s
motion for interlocutory judgment of partition by sale of the property is
granted. 
 
Plaintiff’s
motion to appoint Brandon J. Anand as referee is granted. 
 
Upon sale of the
property, Mr. Anand is ordered to deliver a report to the Court so that the
Court may confirm the sale.
