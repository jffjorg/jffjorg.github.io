And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel filed by the TRN Law Group. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship between the TRN Law Group and Plaintiff Seschwana Costello. The TRN Law Group had attempted to contact Ms. Costello to discuss her representation, but she failed to respond. The court finds that the TRN Law Group has complied with all requirements for relief under California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, and Code of Civil Procedure, Section 284. The court also finds that there will be no prejudice to the client and that the orderly process of justice will not be disrupted.
