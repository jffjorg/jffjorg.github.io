And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition for settlement filed by the Claimants, Kelly Dubon and Gensis Dubon, against the City of Gardena. The settlement would have awarded $13,500 to the Claimants, with $6,000 going to Kelly and $7,500 going to Gensis. However, the judge is denying the petition because the Petitioner failed to provide medical records for the Claimants, specifically a doctor's report containing a diagnosis of their injuries and a report of their current condition. Additionally, the Petitioner did not file an Order to Deposit Funds Into Blocked Account (MC-355) for both Claimants. The judge is ordering the Petitioner to file new petitions curing these defects no later than 9 court days prior to the next hearing date.
