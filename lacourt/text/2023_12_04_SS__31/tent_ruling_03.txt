Petitioner did not provide a copy of Claimants’ medical records. Item 8 requires a copy of a any doctor’s report containing a diagnosis of Claimants’ injuries and a report of Claimants’ current condition. A new report is not necessary if a previous report accurately describes Claimants’ current condition.   Lastly, because Petitioner proposes to deposit the net balance into a blocked account, Petitioner must file an Order to Deposit Funds Into Blocked Account (MC-355) for both Claimants.   Petitioner is to file new petitions curing the above-noted defects no later than 9 court days prior to the next hearing date.   Moving party is ordered to give notice.
