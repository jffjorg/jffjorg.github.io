And here is the summary in English:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion to compel a neurological examination of the Plaintiff, Scott Coleman, by Defendant Joshua Finn. The Defendant seeks to compel the examination because the Plaintiff claims traumatic brain injury from a motor vehicle incident and has identified neurological conditions in written discovery. The Judge finds good cause for the examination and grants the Defendant's motion. The examination will be conducted by Dr. Jeffrey Bounds on December 19, 2023, and will include a detailed evaluation of the Plaintiff's cranial nerves, sensory examination, motor examination, coordination, and station and gait. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to appear for the examination and appoints defense counsel to meet and confer with the Plaintiff to determine a date and time for the examination.
