**Case Information**
  Case Number: 23STCV07569
  Hearing Date: May 29, 2024
  Department: 73

**Parties**
  Plaintiffs: SMITH, et al.
  Defendant: GENERAL MOTORS, LLC

**Counsel**
  Plaintiffs' Counsel: David Barry (The Barry Law Firm)
  Defendant's Counsel: Mary McBride (Erskine Law Group, PC)

**Case Summary**
  The case involves a dispute between Plaintiffs SMITH, et al. and Defendant GENERAL MOTORS, LLC. Plaintiffs brought this action against Defendant in 2021 alleging breach of implied warranty of merchantability, breach of express warranty, and violation of Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. The dispute stems from Plaintiffs' purchase of a 2018 Chevrolet Camaro LT.

**Tentative Ruling**
  The Judge grants Plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses to Special Interrogatory Nos. 14 and 42. Defendant shall serve supplemental responses within 30 days of the Court's order. The Judge denies Plaintiffs' request for sanctions.

**Key Points**
  - Defendant failed to provide a complete response to Special Interrogatory No. 14, which requested the names of technicians who performed warranty repairs on the Subject Vehicle.
  - Defendant's response to Special Interrogatory No. 42 was evasive and nonresponsive, failing to provide information about the investigation into whether the Subject Vehicle qualified for repurchase or replacement under the Song-Beverly Warranty Act.
  - The Judge finds that Plaintiffs made a reasonable attempt to meet and confer with Defendant, but the parties were unable to agree on the supplementation of Defendant's responses.
