And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted plaintiff Landon Strattan's motion for trial preference under California Code of Civil Procedure section 36(a). Strattan, who is 87 years old, alleges that defendants Cedar Corporation dba McDonald's, Richard Ruby, and Vladimir Lopez were negligent in allowing excessive water to accumulate on their restaurant floor, causing him to slip and fall on February 15, 2022. Strattan has undergone various medical treatments, including PRP injections and physical therapy, but still requires surgery and around-the-clock care. The judge found that Strattan has a substantial interest in the action and that his health is such that trial preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing his interest in the litigation. The judge also sustained defendants' objections to Exhibits D and E filed in reply to the opposition.
