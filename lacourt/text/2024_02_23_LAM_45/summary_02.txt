And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the demurrer filed by Tsai Defendants, which argues that the allegations in the complaint do not state a valid claim. The court has reviewed the allegations and finds that the complaint does adequately state claims for sexual harassment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and fraud.

The court finds that the allegations of sexual harassment are sufficient to state a claim, as they allege that Tsai Defendants made comments ridiculing and misgendering the plaintiff during the surgery. The court also finds that the allegations of intentional infliction of emotional distress are sufficient to state a claim, as they allege that Tsai Defendants' conduct was intentional and caused the plaintiff emotional distress.

The court sustains the demurrer as to the fifth, sixth, and ninth causes of action, which alleged breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and violation of the California Unruh Civil Rights Act, respectively. The court finds that these allegations do not state a valid claim.

The court overrules the demurrer as to the first, second, third, and eighth causes of action, which alleged sexual harassment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, fraud, and violations of the California Unruh Civil Rights Act, respectively.

The court grants the motion to strike the prayer for damages, attorneys' fees, and treble damages, as these are not specified in the complaint.

The court sets the matter for hearing on February 23, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
