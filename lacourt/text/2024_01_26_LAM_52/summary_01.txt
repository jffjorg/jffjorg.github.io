And here is a summary in English text:

In this tentative ruling, the judge reviews a motion filed by Plaintiff Perry Lazar to deem matters specified in a request for admissions, set one, to be admitted as true against Cross-Defendant Michelle Pascual. The judge finds that Pascual did not timely respond to the request for admissions, but subsequently served proposed responses that are in substantial compliance with the Code of Civil Procedure. The judge therefore denies Lazar's motion to deem the matters admitted. The judge also exercises its discretion not to impose monetary sanctions against Pascual or her counsel, citing a lack of evidence that Pascual's failure to timely respond necessitated the motion. The judge notes that both parties' counsel corresponded after the responses were due, but Lazar's counsel failed to notify Pascual's counsel of the overdue responses or warn him that a motion to deem the matters admitted would be filed. The judge concludes that imposing sanctions would be unjust in the circumstances and that both parties would have benefited from more effective communication and a pro forma discussion of the motion before it was filed.
