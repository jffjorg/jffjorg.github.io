 Case Number:  23STCV07744    Hearing Date:   January 26, 2024    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment
Plaintiff Mesa Underwriters Specialty Insurance Company brings an action against
defendants Cory Greenwell and Does 1-10 for insurance subrogation.  The clerk entered defendant Cory Greenwell’s
default on October 6, 2023.  On November
14, 2023, the court granted plaintiff’s request to continue this matter to
permit additional time to submit a default judgment packet.  The court set this order to show cause for
January 26, 2024.
Plaintiff
has not submitted a default judgment application.  “When a default is entered, the party who
requested the entry of default must obtain a default judgment against the
defaulting party within 45 days after the default was entered, unless the court
has granted an extension of time.  The
court may issue an order to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed if
that party fails to obtain entry of judgment against a defaulting party or to
request an extension of time to apply for a default judgment within that time.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.110(h).)
The
court granted plaintiff’s request for an extension of time to obtain default
judgment.  The court therefore will count
the 45 days beginning today.  The court
will set an order to show cause re: sanctions under rule 3.110(h) for more than
45 days from now.  Plaintiff may be
sanctioned if it does not submit a default judgment application before that
hearing.
The order to show cause re: default judgment is
hereby continued to March 22, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  The court hereby sets an order to show
cause re: why plaintiff should not pay $100 in sanctions under rule 3.110(h)
for March 22, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
