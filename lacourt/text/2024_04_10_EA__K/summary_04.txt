And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant, Maryam Rouillard, has partially succeeded in her motion to quash or modify the deposition subpoena issued by the plaintiff, Annex Walnut Automotive Colors & Supply, Inc. The judge has granted the motion to quash or modify Categories Nos. 19-24 of the subpoena, which seek information about Rouillard's personal financial records. The judge has also limited Categories Nos. 6-16 of the subpoena to the last seven years. The judge has denied Rouillard's request for sanctions and has denied her motion to quash or modify Categories Nos. 17 and 18 of the subpoena. The judge has also denied Rouillard's motion to modify Categories Nos. 19-24 of the subpoena as moot.

The judge has ruled that the bank records sought by the plaintiff are relevant to the facts and causes of action asserted in both the petition and the cross-complaint and are necessary to prove or disprove the same. The judge has also ruled that the parties' entry into a stipulated protective order can adequately safeguard third-party privacy rights.

Finally, the judge has denied Rouillard's request for sanctions, finding that the motion was made or opposed in bad faith or without substantial justification.
