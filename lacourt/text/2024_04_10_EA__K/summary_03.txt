And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling arises from a motion seeking document production related to a vehicle rollover accident. The plaintiff seeks documents regarding sales, repairs, modifications, and aftermarket parts, as well as documents comparing the aftermarket ROPS system with the manufacturer's system. The judge also notes the plaintiff's request for documents related to the defendant's knowledge of rollover accidents and injuries, as well as the defendant's insurance policy. The defendant, Seidner, is a Polaris dealership, and the plaintiff is seeking discovery related to the purchase and sale of the subject vehicle. The judge cites Code of Civil Procedure ยง 2025.480, which requires the motion to be made no later than 60 days after the completion of the record of the deposition.
