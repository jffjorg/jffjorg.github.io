And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Rasier-CA LLC, has moved to compel responses to form interrogatories, request for admissions, and request for production of documents served on the plaintiff, Michael Roth. The court finds that the defendant properly served the discovery requests and the plaintiff failed to provide responses, despite the due date of January 17, 2024. Therefore, the court grants the defendant's motions to compel responses. The defendant also sought sanctions against the plaintiff, but the court denies this request as it is only mandatory in connection with a motion to compel responses when the motion is unsuccessfully opposed.
