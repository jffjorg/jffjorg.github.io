And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant has moved to compel the plaintiff to undergo an additional independent medical examination (IME) with a neurologist, Dr. Lorne Label. The plaintiff has already undergone an IME with an orthopedist regarding his injuries to his head, neck, and back. The defendant contends that the additional IME is necessary to examine the plaintiff's complaints regarding headaches and dizziness, which are neurological issues. The court finds that there is good cause to compel the plaintiff to submit to the additional IME, as it is relevant to the subject matter of the action and will likely lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The motion is granted, and the plaintiff is ordered to submit to the additional IME with Dr. Label.
