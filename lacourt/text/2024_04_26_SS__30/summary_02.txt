And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The case was dismissed on August 31, 2023, and the plaintiff's counsel did not appear in court for trial because they believed the trial had been continued to March 5, 2024. The plaintiff's counsel filed a motion to set aside the dismissal under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b), which provides for mandatory and discretionary relief from dismissal. The court finds that the plaintiff's counsel has filed an attorney declaration attesting to fault which sufficiently establishes mistake, inadvertence or neglect. The court grants the motion and sets aside the dismissal. The trial is calendared to a date convenient to the court and parties, but no later than February 28, 2025.
