And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's allegations of punitive damages. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's complaint did not sufficiently allege that the defendant's conduct was malicious or oppressive. The judge found that the plaintiff's allegations were sufficient to state a claim for punitive damages, as the plaintiff alleged that the defendant's managing agent was personally guilty of malice by attacking the plaintiff and directing employees to cut him with a sharp knife or box cutter. The judge also rejected the defendant's argument that the plaintiff had not identified the specific individuals who attacked him, as the defendant pointed to no authority that requires the plaintiff to name the managing agent. The judge noted that the grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice, and that the defendant had not requested judicial notice of any documents.
