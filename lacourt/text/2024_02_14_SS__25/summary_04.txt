And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to relieve counsel, Lawrence C. Ecoff, as counsel of record for defendant Construction Servicing Center, Inc. The judge finds that all procedural requirements have been satisfied and there is no showing that withdrawal would cause injustice or undue delay in the proceedings. The breakdown of the attorney-client relationship has made it impossible for counsel to represent the defendant's best interests, and the judge determines that it is in the best interest of the defendant to have new counsel. The judge's ruling is not effective until proof of service of the order is filed in the action.
