And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 1200, LLC vs. Michael Marcus. The plaintiff, 1200, LLC, filed a complaint against the defendant, Michael Marcus, seeking to recover unpaid rent, fees, and repairs for damages from the defendant. The defendant failed to make payments as required by the lease and was eventually evicted. The plaintiff filed a proof of service and a declaration of non-service, indicating that the defendant was served by substituted service to a resident of his household, Salwa Marcus, at the Sarasota address.

The judge found that the defendant was not properly served, as there is no evidence that the Sarasota address is his "dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address" under Code of Civil Procedure section 415.20, subdivision (b). Therefore, the judge vacated the entry of default and denied the request for default judgment.

The judge noted that the plaintiff's default prove-up packet generally met the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800, but there was some confusion regarding the calculation of attorney fees. The judge also found that the plaintiff failed to include a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought, as required by the rule.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling denied the request for default judgment and vacated the entry of default, citing the lack of proper service to the defendant.
