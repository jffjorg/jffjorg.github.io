And here is a summary of the document in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel General Motors, LLC (GM) to provide further responses to their Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Nos. 16-21. The motion was filed on October 18, 2023, and the Judge's ruling was made on March 26, 2024.

The case involves a dispute over a 2019 Chevrolet Blazer, which the Plaintiff purchased under a manufacturer's express warranty. The Plaintiff alleges that GM failed to repair or replace the vehicle, and seeks compensation under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.

The Judge found that the Plaintiff had demonstrated good cause for requesting the documents, and that GM's objections were not sufficient to overcome the established basis for relevance. The Judge also found that GM had not met its burden to demonstrate that a protective order would be inadequate to safeguard its trade secrets and confidential information.

As a result, the Judge ordered GM to provide verified supplemental responses to the Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Nos. 16-21, within 10 days.
