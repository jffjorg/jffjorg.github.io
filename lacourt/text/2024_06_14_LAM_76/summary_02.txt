And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has sustained Defendant Screamline Investment Corporation's demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint, dismissing the first through fourth causes of action. The judge finds that Plaintiff Coaction Specialty Insurance Group, Inc. (f/k/a Prosight Specialty Insurance) lacks standing to sue for breach of contract because it is not a party to the insurance contract and has not demonstrated that it is the real party in interest. The judge notes that the insurance contract does not contain language indicating that Plaintiff is an intended third-party beneficiary. The judge also finds that Plaintiff has failed to plead facts demonstrating that it is the real party in interest as to each of the causes of action, despite being warned that it would only be given one final opportunity to do so. As a result, the judge has sustained the demurrer to each of the four causes of action, dismissing them without leave to amend.
