And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's (Los Angeles Unified School District) motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff (Jane Doe) alleges that the defendant was negligent in its hiring, supervision, and retention of a teacher, Joseph Brown, who sexually assaulted her in 1981. The plaintiff claims that the defendant failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the assault and failed to report the abuse when it was known or should have been known.

The judge found that there are disputes of material fact regarding whether the defendant staff should have reasonably suspected Joseph Brown of child abuse prior to the assault. The judge noted that Joseph Brown's behavior towards students was suspicious and that other teachers may have witnessed his inappropriate behavior. The judge also found that the defendant staff did not receive prior complaints about Joseph Brown's behavior and that the investigation into the assault did not discover any prior complaints.

The judge concluded that the defendant's evidence did not eliminate the allegations that the teachers at Canyon Elementary should have reasonably suspected Joseph Brown of child abuse prior to the assault. Therefore, the judge denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment and the case will proceed to trial.
