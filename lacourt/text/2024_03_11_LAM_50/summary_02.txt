And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for an order to enter judgment in accordance with the stipulated settlement agreement. The agreement, known as the Proposed Consent Judgment, requires the defendants to discontinue the manufacturing of the Covered Product, which contains lead, and to provide clear and reasonable warnings to consumers. The judge finds that the warning required by the settlement does not comply with the relevant laws and regulations. The judge also finds that the attorneys' fees and civil penalty amount are reasonable. The ruling is without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff can refile the motion if the warning is revised to comply with the relevant laws and regulations.
