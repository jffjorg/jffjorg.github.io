[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:  
 
DEMURRER TO
  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES
 




Background
On April 17, 2023,
Plaintiff Lawrence Adams (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants
Neutral Ground, Corey Sims, City of Los Angeles, and Los Angeles Housing
Department. 
On December 15,
2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), alleging
causes of action for (1) declaratory relief, (2) breach of contract, (3) breach
of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and (4) common count –
account stated. 
City of Los Angeles (the “City”) now demurs to the first and fourth
causes of action of the FAC. Plaintiff opposes. 
Discussion 
As an initial
matter, the Court notes that Plaintiff’s opposition to the demurrer was
untimely filed and served. Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b), “[a]ll papers opposing a motion so noticed shall be filed
with the court and a copy served on each party at least nine court days, and
all reply papers at least five court days before the hearing.” In addition,
“[a]ny period of notice, or any right or duty to do any act or make any
response within any period or on a date certain after the service of the
document, which time period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of court,
shall be extended after service by electronic means by two court days…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6,
subd. (a)(3)(A).) 
Here, Plaintiff’s opposition to
the demurrer was filed on March 5, 2024. The proof of service attached to
Plaintiff’s opposition appears to indicate that the opposition was served on
the City on March 4, 2024 by electronic transmission. However, the hearing on
the instant demurrer was noticed for March 11, 2024. Nine court days prior to
March 11, 2024 is February 27, 2024. Two court days prior to this date is
February 23, 2024. As set forth above, Plaintiff’s opposition was served by
electronic transmission well after February 23, 2024, on March 4, 2024. 
In addition, the Court notes
that the City has not yet filed any reply in support of the demurrer. The
deadline for filing a reply would be five court days prior to the March 11,
2024 hearing, or March 4, 2024. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005,
subd. (b).) As discussed, this is the date Plaintiff’s opposition was
served. Thus, the City has not had the requisite time to prepare any reply in
support of the demurrer.   
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the Court continues the
hearing on the City’s demurrer to __________________, at 2:00 p.m. in Dept. 50.

The City may file
and serve a reply in support of the demurrer per
Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b).¿
The City is ordered to give notice of this
Order.
