ORDER RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUESTS FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff
Michelle Pesce (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default judgment against Defendants
1745 San Ysidro Drive, LLC and Christian Toxboe. Plaintiff seeks judgment in
the total amount of $132,202.23, comprising $100,000.00 in damages, $28,523.40 in
prejudgment interest, $3,175.23 in attorney’s fees, and $503.60 in costs. Plaintiff
also seeks interest at the daily rate of $27.40 from February 13, 2024 to the
date the judgment is entered.
The Court finds that
Plaintiff has sufficiently supported her request with the submitted
declarations and evidence. In addition, Plaintiff states in a supporting
declaration that “I
entered into the written agreement (promissory note) attached hereto as exhibit
‘A.’ Exhibit A is a true and correct copy of the promissory note and is
incorporated herein. An original note is not available to me…” (Pesce Decl., ¶
2.) The Court will accept the copy of the promissory note in lieu of the original. 
///
Based on the foregoing,
Plaintiff’s request is granted, and the Court will sign the judgment. No
appearance at the hearing is necessary.¿¿
