[1]The Court noted in the January 10, 2024 Order that “the SAC shows that it was ‘electronically received’ on
August 31, 2023 and the docket shows ‘entered 9/1/23.’ It is unclear whether
the SAC has been ‘filed.’ The Court notes that on August 4, 2023, the parties
filed a ‘Stipulation of the Parties Regarding the Filing of a Second Amended
Complaint and Response by Defendants.’ The Stipulation provides, inter alia,
that ‘Plaintiff shall file and serve a Second Amended Complaint on
Defendants…within thirty (30) days of this Stipulation.’ An Order on the
Stipulation was issued on August 4, 2023.” (January 10, 2024 Order at pp.
2:22-3:5.) The Court notes that the docket now appears to show that the SAC was
filed on September 1, 2023.
