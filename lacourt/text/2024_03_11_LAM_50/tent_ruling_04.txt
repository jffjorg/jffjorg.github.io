[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:  
 
MOTIONS TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
(2)




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 



 
Jeffrey D. Cawdrey and Holly L.K. Heffner of Gordon Rees Scully
Mansukhani, LLP (“Counsel”) move to be relieved as counsel for Defendants Tony Wim Struyk and Oakcrest Manor SD, Inc. 
The Court finds that Counsel has provided
sufficient reason for withdrawal. However, the proposed orders for both motions
(Forms MC-053) do not reference the hearing scheduled for March 15, 2024 on a
motion for judgment on the pleadings, or the May 2, 2024 Informal Discovery
Conference. In addition, Item 5(b) of both proposed orders are checked, but
blank. 
If Counsel provides the Court with revised
orders prior to the hearing, the Court will grant the motion.¿
Counsel are ordered to give notice of this
order.¿
