[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:  
 
DEMURRER BY DEFENDANTS
  JOSEPH DANIEL DAVIS AND HILARY DAVIS TO PLAINTIFF’S SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT
 



 
Background
            Plaintiff
Douglas A. Bagby (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on December 22, 2022 against
defendant Joseph Daniel Davis. 
            On
September 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Verified Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”)
against defendants Joseph Daniel Davis, Hilary Davis, and Randi Desnoes.
The SAC alleges causes of action for (1) “perjury by Defendants Joseph
D. Davis and Hilary Davis Regarding the Transfer of Title of the Ketchum Home
to Hilary Davis,” (2) “intentionally transferring $3.5 million to Nevis Island
to ‘Hinder, Delay, or Defraud’ Plaintiff,” (3) “perjury regarding [Defendant
Joseph D. Davis’s] alleged move to Florida in 2020,” (4) “transfers of assets
to Hilary Davis to ‘hinder, delay, or defraud’ Plaintiff,” (5) “aiding and
abetting defendant Joseph D. Davis in violating the Uniform Voidable
Transactions Act,” (6) “violating orders of the court,” and (7) “assets
transferred to any such Doe Defendants.” The caption page of the SAC
states that the SAC is for “(1) perjury, (2) violations of the Uniform
Voidable Transactions Act, (3) aiding and abetting defendant in transferring
and concealing assets, (4) violations of orders of the court, (5) injunctive
orders, and (6) punitive and exemplary damages.” The Court notes that the
caption page of the SAC is inconsistent with the causes of action alleged in
the remainder of the SAC.
            Joseph Daniel Davis and Hilary Davis
(jointly, the “Davis Defendants”) demurred to the first, second, third, fourth,
sixth, and seventh causes of action of the SAC, as well as the request for
punitive damages in the SAC. Plaintiff opposed. 
Discussion
On January 10, 2024, the Court issued an Order on the Davis
Defendants’ demurrer providing, inter alia, that “the Davis Defendants’
counsel’s declaration and the letter
attached thereto as Exhibit 1 do not
demonstrate that the parties met and conferred by telephone or in person.”
(January 10, 2024 Order at p. 2:13-15.) The Court continued the hearing on the Davis Defendants’
demurrer from January 10, 2024 to March 11, 2024. 
The January 10,
2024 Order further provides that “[t]he Davis Defendants are¿ordered to meet¿and confer¿with
Plaintiffs¿within 10 days of the date of this order.¿If the parties are unable
to resolve the pleading issues¿or if the parties are otherwise unable to meet
and confer in good faith, the Davis Defendants are to¿thereafter¿file and
serve¿a declaration setting forth the efforts to meet and confer in compliance
with¿Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a)(3) within 15 days
of this order.¿The
Davis Defendants shall also include in such declaration an update regarding the
status of the filing of the SAC.”[1] (January 10, 2024 Order at p. 3:8-13.) 
On January 25, 2024, the
Davis Defendants’ counsel filed a declaration stating that “[o]n January 17,
2024, I had a telephone call with Plaintiff Douglas A. Bagby (‘Mr Bagby’)
regarding Defendants Joseph Daniel Davis and Hilary Davis’ Demurrer to Mr.
Bagby’s Second Amended Complaint (‘SAC’)…Mr. Bagby agreed to dismiss the third
and sixth causes of action in his Second Amended Complaint.” (Niedbalski Decl.,
¶¶ 3-4.) 
The Davis Defendants’
counsel further states that “[o]n January 18, 2024, I raised the issue
mentioned in the Court’s January 10, 2024 tentative ruling that the caption
page of the SAC is inconsistent with the causes of action alleged in the
remainder of the SAC to Mr. Bagby via email…On January 18, 2024, Mr. Bagby
responded to my email and agreed with the Court’s comments and stated ‘I do not
know if that mistake requires the filing of a Third Amended Complaint. Do you
have authority suggesting I am required to file an amended complaint to correct
that mistake?’…On January 22, 2024, I responded to Mr. Bagby’s email and
requested a Third Amended Complaint (‘TAC’) be filed to address the mistake and
the Davis Defendants would then withdraw the demurrer to the SAC as it would be
moot if a TAC is filed.” (Niedbalski Decl., ¶¶ 6-8.) 
The Court notes that on
February 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Third Amended Complaint. As set forth
above, the Davis Defendants’ counsel states that the “the Davis Defendants
would…withdraw the demurrer to the SAC as it would be moot if a TAC is filed.”
(Niedbalski Decl., ¶ 8.) In light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the Davis Defendants’ instant demurrer to
the SAC is moot. 
The Davis Defendants are ordered to give
notice of this ruling.
