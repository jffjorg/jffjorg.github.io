And here is the English summary:

The Court's tentative ruling notes that it is unclear whether the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) has been "filed" despite being "electronically received" on August 31, 2023, and being marked as "entered" on September 1, 2023. The Court points out that the parties filed a stipulation on August 4, 2023, which provided for the filing of the SAC within 30 days. The Court notes that the docket now appears to show that the SAC was filed on September 1, 2023. The Court will likely address the status of the SAC at the upcoming hearing.
