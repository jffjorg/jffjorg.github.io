And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by the defendants, Build for You Remodeling Corporation and Igor Rahlin, against the complaint filed by Jason Aguilar. The defendants argued that the complaint does not state a cause of action, and the court has sustained their demurrer. However, the court has stayed the action pending the resolution of an earlier-filed PAGA case brought by the plaintiff against the same defendants. The court has also set a status conference in the current case for June 26, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. The court has determined that staying the action is in the interest of justice, as it would prevent duplicative litigation and allow the parties to engage in more realistic settlement negotiations in the later case.
