And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a consumer protection case filed by Plaintiffs Victor Walker, et al. against E & S Ring Management Corp. The Plaintiffs demurred to the Defendant's answer, which raised 20 affirmative defenses. The judge has sustained the demurrer to some of the affirmative defenses without leave to amend, while sustaining others with leave to amend. The judge has also overruled the demurrer as to the remaining affirmative defenses. The judge's ruling is based on the grounds that some of the affirmative defenses are not properly pleaded, while others are insufficient to constitute a defense. The judge has also considered the requirements of the Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies Act (ICRAA) and the California Code of Civil Procedure (Code Civ. Proc.). The ruling will be finalized after a hearing on December 12, 2024.
