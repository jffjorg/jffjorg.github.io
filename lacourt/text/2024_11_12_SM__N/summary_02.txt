And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that the Defendant's motion to strike portions of the Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint is denied. The Defendant must file and serve an answer to the Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint within 10 days of the entry of this order. The Judge has also granted the Plaintiff's request for judicial notice of an Environmental Protection Agency fact sheet and 40 Code of Federal Regulations section 261.32.

The Judge's analysis focuses on the Plaintiff's allegations of professional negligence and malice against the Defendant. The Defendant had moved to strike the prayer for punitive damages, arguing that the Plaintiff had failed to allege facts supporting such an award. However, the Judge found that the Plaintiff's allegations, including the Defendant's failure to locate obvious information, its representation about the type of dye used, and the presence of a single dry-cleaning machine at the property, supported a claim for punitive damages.

The Judge noted that while allegations of negligence may not typically support a claim for punitive damages, the Plaintiff's allegations of malice, fraud, or oppression may support a claim for punitive damages. The Judge also noted that the Plaintiff's allegations of the Defendant's failure to take action to minimize the risk of contaminated conditions at the property, despite evidence putting it on notice of concerning conditions, could support a claim for punitive damages.

Overall, the Judge's tentative ruling allows the Plaintiff to proceed with its claim for punitive damages, while also giving the Defendant the opportunity to file and serve an answer to the Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint.
