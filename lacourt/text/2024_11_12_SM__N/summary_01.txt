Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Hans Joerg Dau, has moved to quash the service of summons and complaint against him, arguing that the plaintiff, Javier Napoles, failed to serve him properly. The judge has granted the motion. The issue arose because the plaintiff attempted to serve the defendant through substituted service in California and Wyoming, but failed to provide a declaration of diligence for these attempts. The plaintiff then applied for publication in a Los Angeles newspaper, but the application was deficient because it did not include a personal knowledge declaration concerning the defendant's out-of-state activities. The judge found that the plaintiff failed to follow the order for publication because he did not file a declaration of mailing as required by statute and court order. Therefore, the defendant's motion to quash service of summons and complaint is granted.
