And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Khashayar Eshraghi, counsel for plaintiff Hope Montague, may be relieved as counsel. The motion to be relieved as counsel was granted due to a breakdown of the relationship between the counsel and the client. The judge found that Eshraghi had filed the required declaration and shown sufficient reasons for the motion. The judge also noted that Eshraghi had filed and served a proposed order on the client. As a result, the attorney is relieved as counsel of record for the client, effective upon the filing of proof of service of the signed order upon the client.
