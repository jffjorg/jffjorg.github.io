And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a motion filed by KTL Logistics, LLC (the plaintiff) to compel Colliers International Greater Los Angeles, Inc. (the defendant) to produce documents responsive to the plaintiff's requests. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant failed to produce documents that were responsive to their requests, and sought monetary sanctions. The defendant claimed that the delay in producing the documents was due to the voluminous nature of the documents and other factors.

The judge found that the defendant's production of documents was slightly late, but had provided a reasonable explanation for the delay. Therefore, the judge deemed the motion to compel compliance moot. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, finding that the defendant's delay was not unreasonable and that the plaintiff had not shown that the defendant acted in bad faith.

The judge reminded the parties to contact the court to schedule an informal discovery conference to address any further issues related to the production of documents.
