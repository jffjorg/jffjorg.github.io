And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the defendants to transfer the venue of the case to Ventura County. The plaintiff, Firras Naji, alleges that the defendants, Advantage Hospitalist, Inc. and Jack Shenouda, M.D., discriminated against him due to his disability. The defendants argue that the case should be moved to Ventura County because that is where the alleged discriminatory acts occurred and where the relevant witnesses reside. The judge has reviewed the evidence and has denied the motion, finding that the defendants have not met their burden of showing that the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice would be promoted by transferring the case to Ventura County. The judge has also denied the defendants' request for attorney's fees and has ordered that the case proceed in Los Angeles County.
