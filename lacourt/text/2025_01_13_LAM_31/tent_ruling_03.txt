[i] The court previously noted that the
Declaration of Carol Lanehart-King referenced exhibits which were not attached
to her declaration.  The exhibits were
yearbooks wherein Ms. Lanehart-King attested to her ability to accurately
identify to whom she reported Dyer’s sexual assault against her.  The court directed Plaintiff to submit an
amended declaration which included the missing exhibits, or if submitted
elsewhere, to apprise the court where the exhibits may be found.  Plaintiff did neither.  However, given that LAUSD does not challenge the
accuracy of Ms. Lanehart-King’s identification, the court will deny LAUSD’s
motion.  The court cautions Plaintiff to
comply with the court’s order.  Failure
to do so will result in sanctions.
