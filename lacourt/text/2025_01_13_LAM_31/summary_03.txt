And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the case and has made a tentative ruling. The court previously noted that a declaration submitted by Plaintiff, Carol Lanehart-King, referenced exhibits that were not attached. The court directed Plaintiff to submit an amended declaration with the missing exhibits, but Plaintiff failed to do so. Despite this, the court will deny LAUSD's motion to challenge the accuracy of Ms. Lanehart-King's identification, as LAUSD does not dispute her claims. The court cautions Plaintiff to comply with its order and warns that failure to do so will result in sanctions.
