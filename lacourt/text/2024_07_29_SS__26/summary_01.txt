The tentative ruling grants Defendant Jin Koo's Motion for Summary Judgment on the Complaint. The Court finds that the evidence presented by Defendant, including Plaintiff's admissions, shows conclusively that Defendant did not cause Plaintiff's damages. The Court concludes that Plaintiff has failed to establish the elements of causation and damages, and therefore, Defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted. The Court orders Defendant to file and serve a proposed judgment within 20 days of this order.
