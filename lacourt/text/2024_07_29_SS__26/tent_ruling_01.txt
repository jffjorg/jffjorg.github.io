ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiffs Luis Caceres (“Plaintiff”) and Belkys Suazo filed
the instant action for motor vehicle negligence against Defendants Jin Koo
(“Defendant”) and Jenna Koo on October 6, 2022. Defendants filed an answer and
cross-complaint on August 29, 2023. Jenna Koo was dismissed from the action on
September 25, 2023. 
 
On March 27, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s Motion to
Deem Requests for Admission Admitted against Plaintiff. (Minute Order,
03/27/24.) The Court then granted Plaintiff’s counsel’s Motion to be Relieved
as Counsel on April 17, 2024. (Minute Order, 04/17/24.) Belkys Suazo was voluntarily
dismissed from the action on May 24, 2024. 
 
Defendant filed
the instant Motion for Summary Judgment on April 8, 2024. No opposition has
been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The Complaint alleges causes of action for motor vehicle
negligence and general negligence based on a motor vehicle accident that
occurred on October 11, 2020 on the southbound 101 freeway in Los Angeles, California.
(Compl., ¶¶MV-1.) Defendant is alleged to be the person who negligently
operated a motor vehicle involved in the accident and thereby proximately
caused Plaintiff’s injuries. (Id. at ¶¶MV-1 and MV-2.) 
 
Defendant moves for summary judgment on the Complaint
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 437c. A defendant seeking summary
judgment must show either (1)
that one or more elements of the cause of action cannot be established; or (2) that there is a complete
defense to that cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)
Plaintiff is under no evidentiary burden to produce rebuttal evidence until
Defendant meets its initial moving burden. (Binder v. Aetna Life Insurance
Company (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832, 839-840.) 
 
Defendant’s Initial Burden of Proof
 
The Motion is brought on the grounds that Plaintiff has
admitted facts showing conclusively that Defendant did not cause Plaintiff’s
damages. Causation and damages are essential elements of a negligence cause of
action. (County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2006) 137
Cal.App.4th 292, 318.) In support of the Motion, Defendant presents the
following facts. On October 11, 2020, the parties were involved in a two-car
accident in Los Angeles. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 1; Compl., p.
4.) On October 10, 2023, Defendant served Requests for Admission, Set One, on
Plaintiff. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 2; Bhatia Decl., Exh. A.)
Following Plaintiff’s failure to serve responses, the Court granted Defendant’s
Motion to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted on March 27, 2024. (Motion,
Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 4; Bhatia Decl., ¶4 and Exh. B.) Via the
admissions, Plaintiff admits that (1) they were driving a 2011 black Nissan at
the time of the alleged incident on October 11, 2020; (2) at the time of the
alleged incident on October 11, 2020, Plaintiff did not have a valid driver’s
license to operate a vehicle; (3) Plaintiff negligently operated the 2011 black
Nissan at the time of the alleged incident on October 11, 2020; (4) Plaintiff’s
actions caused their 2011 black Nissan to contact Defendant's 2020 black Range
Rover; (5) Defendant was not negligent at the time of the alleged incident on
October 11, 2020. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 3-5; Bhatia Decl.,
¶¶4-7 and Exhs. A-B.)
 
This evidence of Plaintiff’s admissions, as established by
the Court’s March 27, 2024 order, carries Defendant’s initial burden of proof
that Plaintiff cannot establish the elements of causation and damages. The
burden now shifts to Plaintiff to demonstrate the existence of a triable issue
of material fact. Plaintiff, however, has not filed any opposition to the
instant Motion.
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Defendant Jin Koo’s Motion for Summary Judgment is
GRANTED ON THE COMPLAINT. DEFENDANT IS TO FILE AND SERVE A PROPOSED JUDGMENT
WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
