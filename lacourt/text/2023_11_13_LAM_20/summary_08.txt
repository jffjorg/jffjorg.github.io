Significant Statements: 
  - "California favors contractual forum selection clauses so long as they are entered into freely and voluntarily, and their enforcement would not be unreasonable."
  - "Mere inconvenience or additional expense is not the test of unreasonableness . . . of a mandatory forum selection clause."
  - "A court may exercise specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant only if: (1) the defendant has purposefully availed himself or herself of forum benefits; (2) the controversy is related to or arises out of the defendant’s contacts with the forum; and (3) the assertion of personal jurisdiction would comport with fair play and substantial justice."

And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling concerns a habitability matter involving defendants Henry Siegel and Bancroft Towers, LLC, who seek to quash service of summons due to a forum selection clause in the subject lease that requires litigation in Kentucky and a claimed lack of personal jurisdiction in this forum. The court finds that the plaintiff must carry the initial burden of demonstrating facts by a preponderance of evidence justifying the exercise of jurisdiction in California. The court also finds that the forum selection clause is not enforceable as it relates to unwaivable rights grounded in California public policy. Additionally, the court finds that there is specific jurisdiction over the defendants as they have purposefully availed themselves of forum benefits through their ownership and renting of real property in California. As a result, the motions to quash are denied.
