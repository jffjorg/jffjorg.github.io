This is a habitability matter.  Defendants Henry Siegel and Bancroft Towers, LLC seek to quash service of summons because (1) a forum selection clause in the subject lease requires litigation in Kentucky and (2) there is no personal jurisdiction in this forum.  A defendant may move to quash service of summons on the ground the Court lacks personal jurisdiction.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 418.10(a)(1).)  “Although the defendant is the moving party, the plaintiff must carry the initial burden of demonstrating facts by a preponderance of evidence justifying the exercise of jurisdiction in California.”  (In re Automobile Antitrust Cases I and II (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 100, 110.) Defendants first argue that the subject lease requires litigation in Kentucky.  “California favors contractual forum selection clauses so long as they are entered into freely and voluntarily, and their enforcement would not be unreasonable.”  (Am. Online, Inc. v. Superior Court (2001) 90 Cal. App. 4th 1, 11.)  A mandatory forum selection clause is generally given effect unless enforcement would be unreasonable or unfair.  (Verdugo v. Alliantgroup, L.P. (2015) 237 Cal. App. 4th 141, 147.)  “Mere inconvenience or additional expense is not the test of unreasonableness . . . of a mandatory forum selection clause.”  (Berg v. MTC Elecs. Techs. (1998) 61 Cal. App. 4th 349, 359, internal quotation marks omitted.)  A clause is reasonable if it has a logical connection with at least one of the parties or their transaction.  (Verdugo v. Alliantgroup, L.P. (2015) 237 Cal. App. 4th 141, 147.)  The party opposing enforcement of a forum selection clause ordinarily “bears the ‘substantial’ burden of proving why it should not be enforced.” (Global Packaging, Inc. v. Superior Court (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1623, 1633.)However, “California courts will refuse to defer to the selected forum if to do so would substantially diminish the rights of California residents in a way that violates our state's public policy.”  (Am. Online, Inc. v. Superior Court (2001) 90 Cal. App. 4th 1, 12.)  The party opposing enforcement of a forum selection clause ordinarily “bears the ‘substantial’ burden of proving why it should not be enforced.” (Global Packaging, Inc. v. Superior Court (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1623, 1633.)  “That burden, however, is reversed when the claims at issue are based on unwaivable rights created by California statutes. In that situation, the party seeking to enforce the forum selection clause bears the burden to show litigating the claims in the contractually-designated forum will not diminish in any way the substantive rights afforded . . . under California law.”  (Verdugo v. Alliantgroup, L.P. (2015) 237 Cal. App. 4th 141, 147, internal quotation marks omitted.)The Court finds that Plaintiffs’ claims relating to the warranty of habitability relate to unwaivable rights grounded in California public policy, and that Defendants make no showing that Plaintiffs would have equivalent rights in Kentucky.  Therefore, the Court will not enforce the forum selection clause.Defendants also argue there is no general or specific jurisdiction over them in this forum.By statute, the courts of this state may exercise personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendants to the extent permitted by the United States Constitution.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 410.10.)  Constitutional due process requires that a nonresident defendant have “certain minimum contacts” with a forum such that the Court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.  (International Shoe Co. v. State of Washington (1945) 326 U.S. 310, 316.)  The extent of the defendant’s contacts with the forum determines whether the Court’s jurisdiction is general or specific.  (Daimler AG v. Bauman (2014) 134 S.Ct. 746, 754-755.)  Courts may assert general jurisdiction where the foreign defendant’s contacts with the forum “ ‘are so “continuous and systematic” as to render them essentially at home in the forum State.’ ”  (Id. at p. 754.)  To determine whether the exercise of specific jurisdiction is proper in a given case, courts consider the relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation.  (Pavlovich v. Superior Court (2002) 29 Cal.4th 262, 269.)  “A court may exercise specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant only if: (1) the defendant has purposefully availed himself or herself of forum benefits; (2) the controversy is related to or arises out of the defendant’s contacts with the forum; and (3) the assertion of personal jurisdiction would comport with fair play and substantial justice.”  (Elkman v. National States Ins. Co. (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1314.)  It is the plaintiff’s burden to demonstrate that the defendant’s conduct giving rise to the pleaded causes of action amounts to constitutionally cognizable “minimum contacts.”  (Id. at p. 1313.)The Court finds that there is specific jurisdiction because this matter arises out of Defendants’ purposeful ownership and renting of real property in this state, as is apparent from the subject lease.Therefore, the Motions to Quash are denied.Moving parties to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
