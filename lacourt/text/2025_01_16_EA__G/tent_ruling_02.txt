BACKGROUND
On
November 17, 2023, Plaintiffs Jose Guzman Salcedo and Rafael R. Salcedo filed a
complaint against Defendants Franchise Tax Board (FTB), E*TRADE Securities
Inc., E*TRADE Securities LLC, E*TRADE Clearing LLC (E*TRADE Clearing), E*TRADE
Financial Corp., E*TRADE Financial LLC, E*TRADE Group Inc. (E*TRADE), TIR
Holdings Limited (TIR Holdings), John Edward Bersin, Michael D. Lane, Bank of
America, N.A., (Bank of America) and Does 1-100, alleging the following causes
of action: (1) general negligence against the FTB, (2) general negligence
against E*TRADE Securities LLC and E*TRADE Financial Corp., (3) fraud against
E*TRADE Securities LLC, (4) intentional tort against Bersin, (5) intentional
tort against Lane, (6) negligence against Lane, (7) negligence and fraud
against Bank of America by Guzman Salcedo, and (8) negligence against Bank of
America by Salcedo.
On
June 24, 2024, the court sustained demurrers to the Complaint by E*TRADE
Securities LLC, Bersin, and Bank of America without leave to amend. The court
also granted E*TRADE Securities LLC and Bersin’s motion to compel arbitration.
On
July 24, 2024, Lane filed a special motion to strike pursuant to California’s
anti-SLAPP statute. On September 4, 2024, the court granted Lane’s motion.
A
hearing on the present motion is set for January 16, 2025, along with an OSC
Re: Arbitration Status.
ANALYSIS
Lane
moves the court for an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs against
Guzman Salcedo and Salcedo pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16,
subdivision (c)(1). For the following reasons, the court GRANTS IN PART and
DENIES IN PART Lane’s motion.
Legal
Standard
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (c)(1), “a prevailing
defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover that
defendant’s attorney's fees and costs.” However, that defendant is not entitled
to recover attorney fees if the underlying “cause of action is brought pursuant
to Section 11130, 11130.3, 54960, or 54960.1 of the Government Code, or
pursuant to Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 7923.100) of Part 4 of Division
10 of Title 1 of the Government Code.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd.
(c)(2).)
“The
amount to be awarded to a party as attorney fees is a matter within the sound
discretion of the trial judge.” (Contractors Labor Pool, Inc. v. Westway
Contractors, Inc. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 152, 168.) In determining the
reasonableness of an attorney fees award, the court considers “the nature,
difficulty, intricacy and importance of the litigation, the amount involved,
the skill required and success of the attorney's efforts, his or her learning,
age and experience, and the time consumed.” (Id., at p. 169.)
Discussion
In this case,
Lane seeks an award of attorney fees in the amount of $83,314.50. As to Guzman
Salcedo, Lane is a prevailing defendant as the court granted Lane’s special
motion to strike Guzman Salcedo’s fifth cause of action for intentional tort
and sixth cause of action for negligence on September 4, 2024. But as to
Salcedo, Lane did not strike any of Salcedo’s causes of action as Salcedo did
not allege any against Lane. Thus, the court finds Lane is only entitled to
attorney fees and costs from Guzman Salcedo.
The requested
attorney fees are split between two attorneys. The first attorney, Mark Drooks,
requests $5,902.00 at an hourly rate of $1,135.00 for 5.2 hours. (Mayer Decl.,
¶ 11, 15.) The second attorney, Sharon Mayer, requests $75,162.50 at an hourly
rate of $875.00 for 85.9 hours. (Mayer Decl., ¶ 11, 15.) In addition to the
attorney fees, they also request $2,250.00 in fees for 5.7 hours of paralegal
work. (Mayer Decl., ¶ 11, 15.) In a declaration, Mayer provides each attorney’s
education and experience. (Mayer Decl., ¶ 3-4.) Mayer also provides billing
statements to support Lane’s fee request. (Mayer Decl., Ex. 2.) Upon review,
the amount requested is reasonable.
Lane has also
requested the award of $1,314.41 costs. Because Guzman Salcedo failed to file
any objection or request to tax costs, an award of these costs is also granted.
Accordingly,
the court GRANTS Lane’s motion in part as to Guzman Salcedo and DENIES
Lane’s motion as to Salcedo.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Lane’s
motion for attorney fees and costs is GRANTED IN PART as to Guzman
Salcedo and DENIED IN PART as to Salcedo.
