 Case Number:  24PSCV01241    Hearing Date:   January 16, 2025    Dept:  G Plaintiff Redwood Fire and Casualty Insurance Company’s
Motion to Relate and Consolidate Actions
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Redwood Fire and Casualty Insurance
Company’s Motion to Relate and Consolidate Actions is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This is a personal injury
action arising from a motor vehicle collision. On April 18, 2024, Plaintiff Redwood
Fire and Casualty Insurance Company (Redwood) filed a complaint against
Defendants Lun Qiafeng and Does 1-25, alleging causes of action for (1) general
negligence and (2) motor vehicle negligence.
On December 4, 2024, Redwood
filed the present motion. A hearing on Redwood’s motion is set for January 16,
2025, along with a CMC/status conference re: ADR on January 23, 2025.
ANALYSIS
Redwood
moves to consolidate the present action with a personal injury action brought
by David Vaca (LASC Case No. 24PSCV02654). For the following reasons, the court
GRANTS
Redwood’s
motion.
Legal Standard
Code
of Civil Procedure section 1048 grants trial courts discretion to consolidate
actions involving common questions of law or fact. The purpose of consolidation
is to eliminate unnecessary costs or delays by avoiding duplication of
procedure, especially when there are issues common to both actions. (Estate
of Baker (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 471, 485.)
Discussion
In
this case, Redwood argues both cases involve common questions of law and fact.
In the present action, Redwood seeks to hold Qiafeng liable for injuries sustained
by David Vaca on July 18, 2022, in the City of Industry. At the time of the
injury, Vaca was employed by Redwood’s insured. In the other action, Vaca seeks
to hold Qiafeng liable for the same incident.
Based
upon the allegations in the operative pleadings for both actions, they appear
to involve common questions of law and fact. Both actions seek to hold Qiafeng
liable for negligently causing injury to Vaca in motor vehicle collision. Furthermore,
pursuant to Labor Code section 3853, “[i]f either the employee or the employer
brings an action against such third person. . . . the other may, at any time
before trial on the facts, join as party plaintiff or shall consolidate his
action, if brought independently.”
Accordingly,
the court GRANTS Redwood’s motion.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Redwood’s motion to consolidate is GRANTED. 
Cases
24PSCV01241 and 24PSCV02654 are consolidated. 
All dates in Case 24PSCV02654 are advances and vacated.  At the hearing on January 16, 2025, the court
intends to set a Further Case Management Conference in 120 days for the
consolidated matter.
