Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The court has reviewed the defendant, Michael D. Lane's, motion for attorneys' fees and costs. The court has granted the motion in part as to Jose Guzman Salcedo and denied it in part as to Rafael R. Salcedo.

The court's decision is based on the fact that it granted Lane's special motion to strike Guzman Salcedo's fifth cause of action for intentional tort and sixth cause of action for negligence. However, Lane did not strike any of Salcedo's causes of action, as Salcedo did not allege any against Lane.

Lane has requested an award of $83,314.50 in attorney fees and $1,314.41 in costs. The court finds that the amount requested is reasonable and grants the motion in part as to Guzman Salcedo. The court denies the motion in part as to Salcedo, as Lane is only entitled to attorney fees and costs from Guzman Salcedo.

The court's decision is based on California's anti-SLAPP statute and Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (c)(1) and (c)(2). The court finds that the amount of attorney fees and costs to be awarded is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial judge.
