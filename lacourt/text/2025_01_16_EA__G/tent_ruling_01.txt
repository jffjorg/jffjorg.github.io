Proposition 65 Settlement
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Clean Product Advocates LLC’s Motion Confirm
Proposition 65 Settlement is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
BACKGROUND
This a Proposition 65
enforcement action. On November 7, 2023, Plaintiff Clean Product Advocates LLC
(CPA) filed a complaint against Defendants OCM Globe, Inc. (OCM); Calco Farm,
Inc. (Calco); and Does 1-100, alleging a single cause of action for violation
of Proposition 65.
On December 20, 2023, CPA
dismissed Calco from the present action.
On March 20, 2024, CPA filed
a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against OCM and Does 1-100, alleging the same
cause of action.
On April 22, 2024, OCM filed
a cross-complaint against Roes 1-50, alleging causes of action for (1)
comparative indemnity and apportionment of fault, (2) total equitable
indemnity, and (3) declaratory relief.
On October 31, 2024, CPA
filed the present motion. A hearing on the present motion is set for January
16, 2025, along with an OSC Re: Dismissal.
ANALYSIS
CPA
moves for court approval of its proposed settlement with OCM. For the following
reasons, the court DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE CPA’s motion.
Legal Standard
Proposition
65 prohibits “‘knowingly and intentionally expos[ing] any individual to a
chemical known to the state to cause cancer’ without ‘first giving clear and
reasonable warning’ to that individual.” (Consumer Defense Group v. Rental
Housing Industry Members (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 1185, 1213.) Pursuant to
Health and Safety Code section 25249.7, subdivision (d), a litigant may bring a
private enforcement action to enforce Proposition 65. If a private enforcement
action results in settlement, the settlement must be submitted to the court for
approval through a noticed motion. (Health & Safety Code, § 25249.7, subd.
(f)(4).) The court’s approval of the settlement requires “all of the following
findings: (A) The warning that is required by the settlement complies with this
chapter[;] (B) The award of attorney's fees is reasonable under California law[;
and] (C) The penalty amount is reasonable based on the criteria set forth in
paragraph (2) of subdivision (b).” (Health & Safety Code, § 25249.7, subd.
(f)(4).)
Discussion
Pursuant
to the terms of the proposed settlement agreement, OCM is enjoined from
manufacturing, distributing, or directly selling certain products that expose a
person to more than 0.5 micrograms of lead per day unless they utilize certain
warning labels. (Motion, Ex. A, § 3.1.) The covered products include Korean
Style Vermicelli (UPC 854316006269), Sweet Potato Starch Noodles (UPC 141816200021),
Artificial Hot & Sour Pork Flavor Soup (UPC 6921555541524), and Chinese
Gourmet Hot & Sour Pork Bone (UPC 692155556279). (Motion, Ex. A, § 1.3.)
When
warnings labels are required, OCM has agreed to utilize one of the two
following warnings:
“OPTION 1:
WARNING: Consuming this product can expose you to chemicals
including [lead] which is [are] known to the State of California to cause
[cancer and] birth defects or other reproductive harm. For more information go
to www.P65 Wamings.ca.gov/food.
OPTION 2:
WARNING: [Cancer and] Reproductive Harm — www.P65Warnings.ca.gov/food.”
(Motion, Ex. A, § 3.2.)
The
first option complies with the clear and reasonable requirement of Proposition
65. (Health & Safety Code, § 25249.6; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 27, § 25607.2,
subd. (a)(5).) The second option does not, however, as it is not one of the
approved short-form warnings listed in Title 27, section 25607.2, subdivision (b)
of the California Code of Regulations. Thus, the court cannot make the finding
that the proposed settlement requires the use code-compliant Proposition 65
warnings.
Accordingly,
the court DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE CPA’s motion.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, CPA’s
motion to confirm settlement is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
