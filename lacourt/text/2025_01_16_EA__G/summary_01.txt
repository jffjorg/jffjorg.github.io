And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied without prejudice a motion filed by Clean Product Advocates LLC (CPA) to confirm a settlement with OCM Globe, Inc. (OCM). The settlement agreement requires OCM to use certain warning labels on certain products, but the judge found that one of the options for warning labels does not comply with California's Proposition 65. The judge cannot make the required finding that the proposed settlement requires the use of code-compliant Proposition 65 warnings. Therefore, the judge denied the motion to confirm the settlement.
