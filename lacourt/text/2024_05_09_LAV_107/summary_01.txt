And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's application for a right to attach order and writ of attachment against the defendants. The plaintiff sought to attach the defendants' interests in a certain real property to secure a claim for breach of lease and guaranty. The court found that the plaintiff had failed to meet its burden of showing that its claims arose out of the defendants' conduct of a trade, business, or profession. The court also found that the plaintiff's claims were not secured by any interest in real property. Therefore, the court did not reach the probable validity of the claim, the purpose of the attachment, or the amount to be secured.
