  Case Number:  21STCV24281    Hearing Date:   October 1, 2024    Dept:  T Motions  to CompelMoving Party: Defendant University of Southern California (“USC”)Responding Party: N/ATentative Ruling: GRANTBACKGROUNDPlaintiff, Julianne Lattner (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint on June 30, 2021 stating a cause of action of negligence. Plaintiff amended her complaint on May 1, 2024, naming Defendant as Doe 1. Defendant filed an Answer to Plaintiff’s Complaint on June 21, 2024, and the same day served Request for Production of Documents (Set One), Form Interrogatories (Set One), and Special Interrogatories (Set One) on Plaintiff. (Declaration of Patrick E. Stockalper ¶ 2.) Responses to Defendant’s Requests were due by July 23, 2024; Plaintiff failed to serve responses. (Stockalper Decl. ¶ 3). On July 26, 2024, defense counsel sent a correspondence to Plaintiff’s counsel and requested that Plaintiff’s responses, without objections, be provided within 10 days of the date of the letter, and received no response from Plaintiff. (Stockalper Decl. ¶ 4). Defendant has still not received Plaintiff’s responses to the Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Form Interrogatories (Set One), or Special Interrogatories (Set One). MOVING PARTY POSITIONDefendant argues it is entitled to full and complete responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One), Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Request for Production of Documents (Set One), without objections, due to Plaintiff’s failure to provide timely responses.Defendant also argues the Court should impose sanctions in the amount of $735.00 with respect to each of the three motions to compel – totaling $2,205.00. Defendant’s request is based on two hours of work as to each motion at a $225.00 per hour rate, in addition to a $60.00 filing fee as to each motion. (Declaration of Patrick E. Stockalper ¶ 7.)OPPOSITIONNo opposition was filed in response to this motion. ANALYSISI. Motions to Compel A plaintiff may make a demand for production of documents and propound interrogatories without leave of court at any time 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the party to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for production of documents is not limited by number, but the request must comply with the formatting requirements in Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.030. A party may propound 35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action and any additional number of official form interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (a)(1) - (a)(2).)The party whom the request is propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service of a demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a) - (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).) If a party fails to timely respond to a request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request is directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) There is no requirement to meet and confer before filing a motion to compel responses. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 906 [“Where no objections have been made within the statutorily permitted time, they are deemed waived. There is thus nothing to ‘resolve’ . . . .”].Here, it is appropriate to grant all three of Defendant’s motions to compel. The reasoning with respect to each motion is identical. Namely, Defendant timely served Plaintiff with Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One) and Request for Production of Documents (Set One). Plaintiff subsequently failed to provide responses to any of Defendant’s three discovery requests; nor did Plaintiff seek any extensions to provide responses prior to Plaintiff’s July 23, 2024 deadline. The Court therefore finds it is appropriate to grant Defendant’s motions.II. SanctionsThe party who propounded the discovery request may bring a motion to compel and the court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for production of documents or interrogatories, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)Here, Defendant requests $2,205.00 in sanctions against Plaintiff – $735.00 for costs and attorney fees incurred for each of Defendant’s three motions. Defendant requests is based on three hours of work – two on the motion and one to attend the hearing – in addition to a $60.00 filing fee. The Court finds Defendant’s request is reasonable.  RULINGThe Court rules as follows: The Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One) is GRANTED. The Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) is GRANTED. The Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Request For Production of Documents (Set One) is GRANTED.The request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff is GRANTED in the amount of $2,205.00
