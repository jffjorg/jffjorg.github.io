And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to the discovery requests, including the request for production of documents, form interrogatories, and special interrogatories. The judge found that the plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests and did not seek any extensions to provide responses prior to the deadline. The judge also granted the defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $2,205.00, which is based on the costs and attorney fees incurred for each of the three motions to compel. The judge found that the defendant's request is reasonable. The judge's ruling is that the motions to compel are granted, and the defendant is entitled to the requested discovery responses and sanctions.
