Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of J.B. Hunt Transport, Inc. v. Contractor's Wardrobe, Inc. The plaintiff, J.B. Hunt Transport, Inc., alleges that the defendant, Contractor's Wardrobe, Inc., breached a contract and seeks damages. The defendant has demurred to the plaintiff's second and third causes of action and moved to strike the plaintiff's request for attorneys' fees and costs.

The court has sustained the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's second cause of action for common counts, finding that the counts should be listed separately and that the plaintiff's pleading is unclear. The court has also sustained the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's third cause of action for unjust enrichment, finding that unjust enrichment is not a valid cause of action in California.

The court has granted the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's request for attorneys' fees and costs, finding that the request is not supported by the contract. The court has also ordered the plaintiff to strike its request for special and consequential damages, finding that the damages are not allowed under the contract.

The court has given the plaintiff 30 days to amend its complaint and has ordered the defendant to give notice to all parties. The court's ruling is subject to change after a hearing.
