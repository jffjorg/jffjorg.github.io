And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant Los Angeles Unified School District's motion to bifurcate the trial to resolve the issue of field trip immunity first. The defendants argued that bifurcating the trial would promote judicial economy and efficiency, but the judge disagreed. The judge found that the defendants have not shown that bifurcation would serve judicial economy, and that the parties would be required to present the vast majority of the liability evidence twice. The judge also noted that the defendants have not alleged field trip immunity as an affirmative defense in the litigation, and that the court should not bifurcate the litigation to hear a "non-issue." The judge further found that the defendants have waived their statutory immunity defense by not raising it as an affirmative defense.
