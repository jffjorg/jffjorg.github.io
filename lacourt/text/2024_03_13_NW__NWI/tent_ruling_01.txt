BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiffs R.L. alleges they were sexually
assaulted and abused by third party co Defendant Arlan Wesley Harrell while
R.L. was attending a school field trip during their enrollment as a
kindergarten student at Cowan Avenue Elementary School during the 2016-2017
school year. Plaintiff R.L. further alleges Defendants LAUSD and Da Sylveira
failed to properly report, investigate, reprimand, discipline or ban Harrell
and failed to notify the parents of R.L. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Defendant LAUSD’s Motion to Bifurcate
Trial to Resolve Issue of Field Trip Immunity First is DENIED.
 
discussion
 
Defendants Los Angeles Unified School
District and Richard Da Sylveira move for an order requesting the court
bifurcate and try the issue of the application of the field trip immunity prescribed
by Education Code section 35330 before all other issues in this case.
Defendants make the motion on the grounds that the requested bifurcation will promote
judicial economy and efficiency of handling the litigation and will not prejudice
any party. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 598 provides
in pertinent part that, “[t]he court may, when the convenience of witnesses,
the ends of justice, or the economy and efficiency of handling the litigation
would be promoted thereby, on motion of a party, after notice and hearing, make
an order . . . that the trial of any issue or any part thereof shall precede
the trial of any other issue or any part thereof.” Similarly, CCP § 1048(b)
provides in pertinent part that, “[t]he court, in furtherance of convenience or
to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and
economy, may order a separate trial of any cause of action, including a cause
of action asserted in a cross-complaint, or of any separate issue or of any
number of causes of action or issues.”  
 
The court’s discretionary authority to
sever claims and try them separately may also be employed to avoid undue
prejudice to a party. (Stencel Aero Engineering Corp., v. Superior Court
(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 988.) Courts have inherent power to regulate the order of
trial, and therefore can entertain a motion to bifurcate at any time—even
during the trial itself. (McLellan v. McLellan (1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 343,
353.)  
 
The discretion of the trial court to
bifurcate claims and try them separately is broad and will not be disturbed on
appeal, except for abuse. (National Electric Supply Co. v. Mt. Diablo
Unified School Dist. (1960) 187 Cal.App.2d 418; see Buran Equip. Co. v.
H & C Investment Co. (1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 338, 343-344 [commending the
trial court for bifurcating the trial and ordering a specific issue be tried
first, “since, if it had been correctly decided, trial would not have been
required of any other issues.”].) 
 
Defendants state bifurcating the trial
will expeditiously resolve a critical issue that is case determinative, i.e.,
whether field trip immunity under Education Code § 35330 applies to shield Defendants
from liability. Defendants contend almost all of the
evidence on liability and damages are separate and distinct from the immunity
issue. According to Defendants, if immunity is bifurcated and determined to be
applicable, that determination would be potentially dispositive and the need
for a protracted trial could very well be obviated. Alternatively, a finding
adverse to Defendants on this issue could greatly increase the prospects of
this matter being settled and it would afford a more streamlined presentation
of evidence to the jury. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiffs argue Defendants
have not alleged field trip immunity as an affirmative defense in the
litigation, and the court should not bifurcate the litigation to hear a “non-issue.”
The court agrees. 
 
As noted by Plaintiffs, a defendant
waives any statutory immunity the defendant might have by not raising the issuing
of statutory immunity as an affirmative defense. (See Quigley v. Garden
Valley Fire Protection Dist. (2019) 7 Cal.5th 798, 802-803, 808-816.) While
generally referring to the section may be deemed non waiver (see Hata v. Los
Angeles County Harbor/UCLA Medical Center (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1791, 1804),
that is not the case here. In Hata, the county argued the trial court
erred in determining it had not adequately pleaded the section 854.8 immunity
in its answer, and, therefore, waived this defense. The Court of Appeals agreed
and found the “[c]ounty [properly] stated that each of Hata's purported causes
of action and damages claims were ‘limited and/or barred by the terms of
California Government Code §§ 854–856.6.’” (Ibid.) The court found the affirmative
defense “referred to the immunities directly related to medical activities
under the Tort Claims Act and included the relevant code provision, section
854.8. The applicable provision was neither hidden nor omitted from the answer,
and County provided Hata sufficient notice it was relying on a specific type of
immunity defense.” (Id. at p. 1805.) In other words, the County’s answer
claiming immunity under Gov. Code “§§ 854-856.6” was sufficient to raise
immunity under § 854.8. 
 
Here, Defendants’ immunity defenses
include Immunity (Thirteenth Affirmative Defense), Governmental Immunities under
Government Code §§815, 815.2, 815.6, 818, 818.2, 818.6, 818.8, 820, 820.2, 820.4, 820.6, 820.8, 821, 821.4,
and 840 (Fourteenth Affirmative Defense), Absolute Immunity (Sixteenth
Affirmative Defense), and Qualified Immunity (Seventeenth Affirmative Defense).
None of which refer specifically to Education Code section 35330(d) or
Education Code sections 35330 – 35332 generally. The court further notes it is
true Section 35330(d) provides “absolute” immunity; however, “absolute
privileges and immunities, too, ordinarily apply only if the defendant invokes
them.” (Quigley, supra, Cal.5th at p. 809.) 
 
LAUSD is correct though “whether the
filing of an amended pleading should be allowed at the time of trial is
ordinarily committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Moss
Estate Co. v. Adler (1953) 41 Cal.2d 581, 585.) 
 
So even considering LAUSD is allowed the
belated assertion of the affirmative defense of Education Code section 35300(d)
upon amendment, the court finds Defendants still have not shown bifurcation
will serve judicial economy. Defendants argue it should be left within the purview
of the jury to determine whether the Kidspace Museum trip meets the requirements
to be deemed a field trip, excursion or school-sponsored activity, and
therefore, determining whether the immunity applies or does not apply. However,
as noted by Plaintiffs, it is not undisputed that the events which give rise to
Plaintiff's alleged injuries occurred during a field trip. Instead, Plaintiffs
argue this was a ‘school sponsored activity’ and subject to Education Code
section 44808. Moreover, Plaintiffs' contend their cause of action for both
negligence and IIED do not rely solely on the actions which took place on the
Kidspace trip. Instead, they reply on the lack of reporting/delayed reporting
of the alleged molestation. As such, the parties will be required to present
the vast majority of the liability evidence twice. 
 
Accordingly, Defendant LAUSD’s Motion to
Bifurcate Trial to Resolve Issue of Field Trip Immunity First is DENIED.
