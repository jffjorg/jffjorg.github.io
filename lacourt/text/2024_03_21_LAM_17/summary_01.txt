And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend to file a first amended complaint (FAC). The plaintiff had filed a complaint against the defendants alleging breach of contract, fraud and concealment, conversion, and money had and received. The plaintiff sought to add new allegations that the defendants knowingly concealed the existence of a bank loan that was subject to a repayment hierarchy. The defendants argued that the plaintiff was aware of the repayment hierarchy and that they did not conceal the existence of the bank loan. However, the judge found that the plaintiff's evidence indicated that the defendants failed to disclose the existence of the bank loan until January 2024, and that the plaintiff's claims were not barred by any prejudice to the defendants. The judge noted that the policy favoring leave to amend is strong and that it is an abuse of discretion to deny an amendment unless the adverse party can show meaningful prejudice. Therefore, the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend is granted, and the plaintiff will be allowed to file a FAC.
