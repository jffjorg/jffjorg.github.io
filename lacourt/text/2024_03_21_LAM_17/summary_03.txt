This is a tentative ruling by Judge Jon R. Takasugi in a case between HK Yuntao, Inc. Limited (Plaintiff) and American Fashion Network, et al. (Defendants). The Plaintiff filed a complaint alleging breach of contract, goods sold and delivered, account stated, open book account, fraud, and unfair business practices. The Defendants demurred to the complaint, arguing that the Plaintiff lacks subject matter jurisdiction, standing, and has insufficiently pled claims. The Court agrees with the Defendants and sustains their demurrer, giving the Plaintiff 20 days to amend. The Court also notes that if the Plaintiff resolves the deficiencies in its complaint, it may have alleged sufficient facts to support its underlying claims. The Court rules that the Plaintiff's allegations of fraud are sufficient, but that the Plaintiff must allege facts that show the existence of binding contracts.
