And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from the defendant to his requests for production (RFPs) in part, and denied it in part. The judge agrees that good cause exists to compel further responses, but finds that the scope of some requests must be narrowed. The judge also finds that some requests are overly broad and would be unduly burdensome to produce. The judge has declined to award sanctions at this time. The parties must submit on this tentative by email to the court by 4 p.m. the day prior to the hearing. If all parties submit, the court will adopt this tentative as the final order.
