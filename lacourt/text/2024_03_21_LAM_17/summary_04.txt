And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by BJ's Restaurant, Inc. (Defendant) to the complaint filed by Eduardo Valentin Cruz (Plaintiff) alleging various labor code violations. The Plaintiff argued that his claim was timely filed, but the court found that the Plaintiff did not file his PAGA claim until December 20, 2023, nearly two months after the one-year statute of limitations period had expired. The court also rejected the Plaintiff's argument that his untimely filing was related back to an earlier-filed PAGA claim. The court concludes that the Plaintiff's claim appears time-barred on its face and sustains the demurrer without leave to amend.
