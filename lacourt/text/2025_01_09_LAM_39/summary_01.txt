And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motion by the Defendant, Hartford Gold Group, to enforce a settlement agreement with the Plaintiff, Robert Scheff, under California Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The settlement agreement requires the Plaintiff to indemnify the Defendant from any liability arising from the Defendant's defense of a cross-complaint by Paychex Business Solutions, LLC. The Plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that he is only obligated to defend the Defendant if the Defendant accepts his proposed attorneys.

The Court finds that the Defendant has the better of this argument because it has a right to conduct its own defense and request reimbursement from the Plaintiff for defense costs. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff's refusal to indemnify the Defendant for the cost of an attorney selected by the Defendant is improper.

The Court grants the Defendant's motion to the extent that it seeks a determination that the Plaintiff must reimburse the Defendant for the reasonable attorney fees incurred in defending the cross-complaint. If the parties are unable to agree on the reimbursement, the Court directs the Defendant to file a motion to recover its attorney fees, which will permit the Court to determine the reasonable amount of attorney fees incurred.

The Court denies the Defendant's request for attorney fees incurred in connection with the motion to enforce the settlement agreement. The Court orders the Defendant to give notice of this order and to file proof of service thereof.
