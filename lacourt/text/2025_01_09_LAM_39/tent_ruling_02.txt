Motion for Protective Order

OPPOSING PARTY:


Defendant Homeboy Industries



 
MOTION
            Plaintiff
Jose Sevilla moves for a protective order in this case.  Defendant Homeboy Industries (“Defendant”)
opposes the motion.
ANALYSIS
In his notice of
motion, Plaintiff does not specify the protective order he seeks.  As such, the Court cannot grant the
motion.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1010
[“the notice of a motion, other than for a new trial, must state when, and the
grounds upon which it will be made, and the papers, if any, upon which it is to
be based”]; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1110(a) [“A notice of motion must state
in the opening paragraph the nature of the order being sought and the grounds
for issuance of the order”]; People v. American Surety Ins. Co. (1999)
75 Cal.App.4th 719, 726 [same].)  
As authority for
this motion, Plaintiff cites Code of Civil Procedure sections 2017.020 and
2031.060.  Code of Civil Procedure
section 2017.020 permits the court to restrict a party’s right to limit the
scope of discovery if it determines the method of discovery is unduly
burdensome, expensive, or intrusive.  It
is unclear how this provision could apply to the matter at hand, as Plaintiff
does not state how he seeks to restrict the scope of permissible discovery.  Likewise, Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.060
permits a party to seek a protective order if the number of requests for
production of documents another party serves on it is excessive.  Plaintiff does not assert he seeks to limit
the number of requests for production in this action.  Further, Defendant contends Plaintiff has
already responded to discovery requests Defendant propounded on him.  If Plaintiff has served responses to all
pending discovery requests, the motion for protective order regarding such
requests is moot.  
Accordingly, the
motion is denied, but without prejudice to its renewal if Plaintiff deems a
protective order is warranted.
Plaintiff is
ordered to give notice of this order and to file proof of service thereof.
