And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the motion of Charles E. Smith, the plaintiff's counsel, to be relieved from representing the plaintiff. The motion was filed with necessary documents, including a notice of motion, an order granting attorney's motion to be relieved, and a declaration in support. The judge is satisfied that the counsel has a compelling reason to withdraw. The next hearing in the case is a final conference on December 22, 2023, and trial is set to begin on January 5, 2024. The judge is requiring the counsel to serve a copy of the signed order on the client and all parties that have appeared in the case, and the effective date of the order relieving counsel is delayed until proof of service has been filed with the court.
