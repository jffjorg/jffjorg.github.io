Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the motion to compel the deposition of non-party witness Koen "Ken" Kim is denied. The judge notes that Kim's deposition was originally scheduled for August 9, 2023, but was postponed after Kim's counsel provided a doctor's note stating that Kim was under medical care and needed to delay his deposition for medical reasons. The judge finds that there is no evidence that Kim failed to appear for his deposition, as the deposition was agreed to be postponed. The judge also notes that it is not improper to "unilaterally" pick a date for a deposition, and that the parties must agree on a date in order to have a proper notice or subpoena. The judge denies the motion and orders the moving party to give notice to all parties.
