Here is the YAML summary of the tentative ruling:

```
Case Number: 20STCV09554
Case Name: Maria Lopez; Martin Gonzalez v. Matrix Service, Inc., et al.
Moving Party: Defendant, Torrance Refining Company, LLC (“TORC”)
Responding Party: Defendant, Matrix Service, Inc.
Trial Date: May 6, 2024
Motion: (1) TORC’s Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the alternative, Summary Adjudication; (2) Ex parte application for entry of issue sanctions; (3) Belated request for PMK deposition

Case Summary:
Plaintiffs brought a negligence action against several defendants, including Matrix Service, Inc. and Torrance Refining Company, LLC, after a worker was fatally injured on a job site. The court granted summary judgment in favor of Matrix, finding that the worker was an independent contractor and that the company had no liability for the worker's injuries.

Key Issues:

1. Privette Doctrine: The court applied the Privette doctrine, which holds that a hirer of an independent contractor is not liable for the contractor's injuries if the contractor was responsible for his own safety.
2. Retained Control Exception: The court found that there was no evidence that TORC retained control over the manner in which the contractor performed the work, and therefore no retained control exception to the Privette doctrine applied.
3. Negligence: The court found that there was no evidence that TORC had notice or actual knowledge of the use of the jack stand and airbag combination, and therefore no triable issue of fact as to the negligence claim.

Conclusion:
The court granted summary judgment in favor of TORC, finding that the Privette doctrine applied and that there was no evidence of negligence by TORC.
