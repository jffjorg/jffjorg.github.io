Summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The Court has granted Plaintiff Millstone Point, LLC's motion for summary judgment against Defendants Stay LLC and Empathy Labs LLC. The motion is granted because Plaintiff has established its burden of showing that Defendants failed to make rental payments as agreed in the Lease and failed to cure the default after receipt of the Notice. The Court has also ruled that Empathy's self-representation is improper, but since Empathy's answer has already been stricken and Stay LLC is in default, no further action is taken. The Court orders Plaintiff to lodge a proposed judgment with the Court and serve it on Defendants within 10 days.
