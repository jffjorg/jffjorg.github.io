And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling continuing the hearing on Dr. Khouganian's motion to strike portions of the Fifth Amended Complaint (5AC) to November 3, 2023. The motion was filed on August 18, 2023, and the judge finds that it would promote judicial economy to hear this motion concurrently with Nevro's motion to strike, scheduled for November 3, 2023. The judge notes that the Stipulation to Continue the Hearing filed by Nevro was rejected because it was not accompanied by a proposed order for the court's signing. The judge orders that Dr. Khouganian's motion to strike be heard at 8:30 a.m. on November 3, 2023, and that the defendant provide notice of this order.
