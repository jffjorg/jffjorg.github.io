[1] Defendant argues
that Plaintiffs have not alleged any facts that Defendant made any
representations to Plaintiffs directly. 
However, the allegations of the complaint allege that Defendant produced
and distributed informational marketing materials, such as brochures and
manuals, which touted the characteristics of the subject vehicle and its
transmission, but failed to disclose the defects of the transmission.  (See Compl., ¶¶119-122.)
