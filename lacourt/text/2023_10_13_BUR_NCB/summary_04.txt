This is a tentative ruling by a Judge regarding a case between Margaret Stephens (Plaintiff) and City of Burbank (Defendant). The case involves a personal injury lawsuit filed by Plaintiff, alleging that she fell and was injured due to a dangerous condition on a sidewalk in Burbank. Defendant has moved for terminating, issue, and/or evidentiary sanctions against Plaintiff for her failure to provide timely discovery responses. The Judge has denied Defendant's motion for terminating sanctions, finding that Plaintiff's failure to provide responses was due to inadvertence and not willful. The Judge has also denied Defendant's alternative request for issue and/or evidentiary sanctions. However, the Judge has granted Defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $900. The Judge has ordered Plaintiff and her counsel to pay the monetary sanctions to Defendant within 20 days of notice of this order.
