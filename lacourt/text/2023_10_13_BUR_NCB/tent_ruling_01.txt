[TENTATIVE] order RE:
motion to STRIKE



 
On July 19,
2023, Plaintiff Jasper Rose (“Plaintiff”) filed the Fifth Amended Complaint
(“5AC”) against Defendants Raymond G. Tatevossian, Greg Khouganian, and Nevro
Corporation for: (1) misrepresentation against Nevro and (2) failure to obtain
informed consent against Dr. Khouganian. 

On August 18,
2023, Dr. Khouganian filed a motion to strike portions of the 5AC.  On September 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed an
opposition brief.  On October 5, 2023,
Dr. Khouganian filed a reply brief.
On October 3,
2023, Nevro filed a Stipulation to Continue the Hearing on the Motion to Strike
so that Dr. Khouganian’s motion to strike could be heard concurrently with
Nevro’s motion to strike reserved for November 3, 2023.  The Clerk of the Court rejected the
Stipulation because it was not accompanied by a proposed order for the Court’s
signing. 
As a proposed
order was not attached, the Court issues this written order continuing the
hearing on Dr. Khouganian’s motion to strike to November 3, 2023.  The Court finds that it would promote
judicial economy to hear Dr. Khoguanian’s motion to strike with Nevro’s motion
to strike so that there are not multiple orders regarding the 5AC.  
Dr. Khouganian’s
motion to strike portions of the 5AC is continued to November 3, 2023 at 8:30
a.m. in this Department B.  
Defendant shall provide
notice of this order.
