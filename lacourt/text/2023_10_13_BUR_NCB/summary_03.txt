And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer and motion to strike filed by TheOldSchool, LLC and Netflix, Inc. and has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the sole cause of action for gross negligence. The court finds that the plaintiff, Marco Morante, has failed to allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action for gross negligence against the defendants. The court notes that the plaintiff's allegations of gross negligence are conclusory and do not support these allegations with facts.

As a result, the court has dismissed the case with prejudice. The court has also taken off-calendar the motion to strike as it is moot in light of the ruling on the demurrer.

The defendants are ordered to provide notice of this order.
