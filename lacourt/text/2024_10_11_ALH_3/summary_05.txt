And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively granted the application for default judgment filed by Porsche Leasing Ltd. and Porsche Financial Services, Inc. against Xusheng An. Previously, the court found the application defective because it did not include an interest calculation showing the basis for the request for $6,943.84 in prejudgment interest. However, the plaintiffs have since filed a declaration from their attorney stating that the interest calculation is based on An's default date of May 30, 2023, and accrues at a rate of 10% per annum. The court has found that the interest rate is correct based on the applicable statute for calculating prejudgment interest, Civil Code section 3289. The judge has granted the application for default judgment.
