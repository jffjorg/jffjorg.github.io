And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is regarding an application for default judgment by Plaintiffs Porsche Leasing Ltd. and Porsche Financial Services, Inc. against Defendant Junkui Peng. The Court previously found the application defective because it did not include an interest calculation showing the basis for the requested prejudgment interest of $6,485.01. However, on September 25, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a declaration from their attorney, Stacey A. Miller, which shows that the amount of prejudgment interest is based on Peng's default date of June 26, 2023, and accrues at a rate of 10% per annum. The Court granted the application for default judgment, citing California Code of Civil Procedure section 685.010 for money judgments and Civil Code section 3289 for calculating prejudgment interest.
