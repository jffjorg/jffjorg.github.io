Plaintiffs Porsche Leasing Ltd. and Porsche
Financial Services, Inc. (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) apply for a default
judgment against defendant Xusheng An. The Court previously found that the application
was defective because Plaintiffs did not include an interest calculation
showing the basis for their request for $6,943.84 in prejudgment interest. (CRC
3.1800(a)(3).) On September 24, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a declaration from their
attorney, Stacey A. Miller, who states that the amount of prejudgment interest
is based on An’s default date of May 30, 2023, and accrues at a rate of 10% per
annum pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 685.010. Code of Civil Procedure
section 685.010 only applies to money judgments, but the stated rate of 10% per
annum is correct based on the applicable statute for calculating prejudgment
interest, Civil Code section 3289. Accordingly, the application for default
judgment is GRANTED.
