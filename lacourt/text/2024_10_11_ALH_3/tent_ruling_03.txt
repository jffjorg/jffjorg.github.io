I.           
INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff Francisco Teletor Sente
(“Plaintiff”) moves to tax $1,305 in costs claimed by defendants Anthony Griego
and Diana Griego, individually and as trustee for the Diana Griego Trust
(collectively, “Defendants”) for filing fees in their memorandum of costs filed
on August 20, 2024. 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
The “prevailing party” is entitled to
recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd.
(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606.) “Prevailing party”
includes the party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a
dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains
any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any
relief against that defendant. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)
Recoverable costs “shall be reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or
beneficial to its preparation.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(2).) “If
the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is
on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or
necessary.” (Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th
761, 774.) Verification of the memorandum of costs by the prevailing party’s
attorney establishes a prima facie showing that the claimed costs are proper.¿(See Jones v. Dumrichob (1998)
63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1267 [“There is no requirement that copies of
bills, invoices, statements, or any other such documents be attached to the
memorandum.”].) Mere conclusory assertions are
insufficient to rebut a prima facie showing by the prevailing party. (Rappenecker
v. Sea-Land Service, Inc. (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 256, 266.)  “On the other hand, if the items are properly
objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party
claiming them as costs. [Citations.] Whether a cost item was reasonably
necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for the trial court and
its decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion.” (Ladas, supra,
19 Cal.App.4th at p. 774.)
 
III.       
DISCUSSION
Defendants’ memorandum of costs claims
3 first appearance fees associated with their demurrer to Plaintiff’s first
amended complaint. Plaintiff argues that Defendants should not be able to
recover $1,305 in filing fees without submitting documentation. Plaintiff also
argues that Defendants have “included the cost three times for each defendant.”

These arguments are unpersuasive
because the verified memorandum is a prima facie showing of allowable costs and
does not require any documentation to be attached. (See Jones, supra,
93 Cal.App.3d at p. 266.) In addition, the listed costs are for Defendants’ filing
fees for their demurrer and first appearance. Filing fees are allowable as
costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 10333.5, subd. (a)(1).) Moreover,
the claimed total cost of $1,305 is reasonable because there are three
defendants and each defendant must pay a “first paper” filing fee. (Townzen
v. Cty. of El Dorado (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358 [awarding each of eleven
defendants a filing fee for responsive pleading as costs].) Under the Superior
Court of California’s civil fee schedule, each defendant is required to pay an
initial filing fee of $435 for their Answer or other first paper filed. (Gov.
Code, §§ 70611; 70602.5, subd. (a); 70602.6, subds. (a), (b); 70612.)
Therefore, three first appearance fees of $435, which amount to $1,305, is not
excessive and the amount will not be taxed.   
IV.       
CONCLUSION
Plaintiff’s motion to tax costs is
DENIED.
