And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Alhambra is seeking a summary judgment or summary adjudication in a case involving a woman who was injured when a tree branch fell on her head in Almansor Park. The City of Alhambra argues that it did not have actual or constructive notice of the tree's dangerous condition and that the woman's injuries were caused by a freak accident. The woman argues that the City of Alhambra was negligent in its inspections and maintenance of the park and that it should have detected the tree's problems before the incident.

The Court notes that the City of Alhambra had inspected the tree before the incident, but did not detect any problems. The Court also notes that the woman's expert, Evin Lambert, opined that the tree exhibited moderate to severe stem cankers, which are a significant indicator of adverse tree health and structural weakness.

The Court finds that there are triable issues of fact regarding whether the City of Alhambra was negligent in its inspections and maintenance of the park and whether it had actual or constructive notice of the tree's dangerous condition. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication is denied.

The Court also notes that the City of Alhambra's motion for summary adjudication of the woman's negligence cause of action is improper because it is asking the Court to limit the scope of liability, which is not a proper basis for summary adjudication.
