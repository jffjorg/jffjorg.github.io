The judge's ruling is based on 1155 Angelo Dr LLC's failure to provide sufficient grounds for consolidation and its failure to provide all pleadings and supporting documents. The judge is concerned about the possibility of inconsistent rulings and urges the parties to work together informally to streamline their claims.
