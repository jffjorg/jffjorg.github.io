And here is the English-text summary:

The court is considering a request from the plaintiff, John Tebbens, to continue all hearings to January 12, 2024, due to his medical disability. The court has previously continued hearings on the pending motions to compel due to the plaintiff's purported medical necessity, despite the lack of evidence of his medical status. The court is exercising its discretion to continue the hearings to January 12, 2024, as the plaintiff submits evidence of disability until January 2, 2024. The court notes that there is no legal authority allowing for repeated continuances based on a party's disability, particularly where the nature of the disability does not preclude the party's ability to comply with discovery obligations or attend hearings remotely. The plaintiff is advised to seek legal assistance if his medical status prevents him from participating in the action, as the parties are entitled to a timely resolution of the case.
