And here is the English summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the hearing on the motion to confirm the arbitration award is continued to February 9, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The Petitioners/Defendants, Century Law Group LLP, Edward Lear, and Rizza Gonzales, served the Plaintiff/Respondent in pro per via email only, despite there being no indication that the Plaintiff agreed to accept service by email. As the Plaintiff's counsel has passed away, the Judge notes that a pro per is not required to accept electronic service. The Petitioners/Defendants are required to serve the petition and notice of the continuance by proper means.
