And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the court's March 23, 2023 ruling on the defendant's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories. The plaintiff argues that the ruling was unfair and that the defendant illegally brought the motion on behalf of a suspended corporation. The plaintiff also argues that the court should consider the plaintiff's inability to pay attorney fees.

The court has considered the plaintiff's arguments and finds that there is no basis for reconsideration of the court's ruling. The court's ruling is based on the law and the facts presented at the original hearing, and the plaintiff has not demonstrated new or different facts, law, or circumstances that justify reconsideration. The court's ruling is DENIED.
