SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
Plaintiffs Michellyn Russel (Michellyn) and Joseph Angulo
(Joseph) filed this action on behalf of themselves and their son Plaintiff
William Angulo (William) (collectively, Plaintiffs) against several medical
providers, including Defendant Janet Schori, M.D. (Dr. Schori), for
professional/medical negligence (alleged on behalf of Michellyn and William) and
negligent infliction of emotional distress (alleged on behalf of Michellyn and
Joseph) arising out of the care and treatment provided to Michellyn and William
during the course of the pregnancy and the birth of William.  (Complaint ¶¶3, 8).  Plaintiffs allege that all of the defendants
acted below the standard of care by improperly and negligently providing continuing
prenatal care and care associated with the birth of William which resulted in
injuries.  (Complaint ¶¶8-9). 
 
On 12/6/23, this Court overruled Dr. Schori’s demurrer to
the 1st cause of action for professional/medical negligence and
sustained with 30 days leave to amend Dr. Schori’s demurrer to the 2nd
cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress.  (See 12/6/23 Minute Order).  On 12/11/23, 5 days later, Dr. Schori filed
an answer to the complaint.  No amended
complaint nor dismissal of the 2nd cause of action was filed leaving
the status of the 2nd cause of action unclear.  
 
On 5/7/24, Dr. Schori filed and served the instant motion
seeking an order granting summary judgment in favor of Defendant Janet Schori,
M.D. and against Plaintiffs William Angulo, a minor through his Guardian ad
Litem, Joseph Angulo, and Michellyn Russell on the issue of Medical Negligence.  The motion was originally set for hearing on
8/13/24.  On 7/30/24, Plaintiffs’
attorney filed and served a request for a 60-day continuance of the hearing on
the motion and for the submission of opposition papers.  On 8/13/24, the request for a continuance was
granted and the hearing was continued to 10/23/24.  (See 8/13/24 Minute Order).  At the 8/13/24 hearing, the Court also dismissed
the 2nd cause of action without prejudice.  Id.     
On 10/9/24, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ ex parte
application for another continuance of the hearing on the motion and continued
the hearing to 1/9/25.  (See 10/9/24
Minute Order).  
 
On 12/24/24, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Non-Opposition
to the motion.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
A defendant may move for summary judgment or summary
adjudication if it is contended that the cause of action has no merit.  CCP 437c(a).  A cause of action has no merit if: (1) one or
more of the elements of the cause of action cannot be separately established,
even if that element is separately pleaded, or (2) a defendant establishes an
affirmative defense to the cause of action. CCP 437c(o).  The motion shall be granted if all of the
papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact
and that the defendant is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.  CCP 437c(c).
 
The elements of a cause of action for professional
negligence/medical malpractice are: (1) the duty of the professional to use
such skill, prudence and diligence as other members of the  profession commonly possess and exercise; (2)
breach of that duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between the negligent
conduct and the resulting injury; and, (4) actual loss or damage resulting from
the professional negligence.  Banerian
(1974) 42 CA3d 604, 611-612.   
 
The standard of care in a medical malpractice action is
beyond the knowledge of a layperson and, therefore, must be addressed by a
qualified expert.  Landeros (1976)
17 C3d 399; See also Huber, Hunt & Nichols, Inc. (1977) 67
CA3d 278, 313; Wynner (1976) 97 CA3d 166.  When a defendant moves for summary judgment
and supports the motion with an expert declaration that the defendant’s conduct
fell within the community standard of care, the defendant is entitled to
summary judgment unless the plaintiff presents conflicting expert evidence.  Munro (1989) 215 CA3d 977, 984-985.  Additionally, with regard to causation, a
plaintiff must prove with a reasonable medical probability, based on competent
expert testimony, that a defendant’s negligent conduct was a substantial factor
in bringing about (causing) the injury.  Bromme
(1992) 5 CA4th 1487, 1498-1499; Dumas 235 CA3d 1593, 1603.
 
Dr. Schori has submitted the expert opinion of James
Macer, M.D., an OB/GYN expert, who opines that the care and treatment provided
by Dr. Schori to Michellyn complied with the applicable standard of care.  (Separate Statement (SS) 17-23).  Dr. Macer also opines that to a reasonable
degree of medical probability, Plaintiffs’ alleged harm was not the result of
anything Dr. Schori did or failed to do. 
(SS 17-23).
 
Plaintiffs have not submitted any expert opinion to
contradict the foregoing opinions of Dr. Macer. 
In fact, Plaintiffs have filed a non-opposition to the motion indicating
that they do not oppose the instant motion. 
(See Notice of Non-Opposition filed 12/24/24).
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted.
