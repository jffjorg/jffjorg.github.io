And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the petition for approval of a minor's compromise. The claimant, Ebeny Arellano, is exempt from personal appearance, and counsel may appear by telephone or video conference. The court reviewed the petition and submissions, including a new petition filed on September 11, and found that all substantive and procedural requirements are satisfied. The court also reviewed the proposed settlement and fees and finds them fair and reasonable. The only issue noted is an incorrect amount listed in the proposed order, which the court directs the judicial assistant to correct. The court sets an OSC (Order to Show Cause) regarding proof of deposit of funds into a blocked account.
