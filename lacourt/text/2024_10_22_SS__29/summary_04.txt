And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint. The motion was filed on September 25, 2024, after the complaint was dismissed on September 9, 2024, due to the failure of the plaintiff's attorney to appear at an Order to Show Cause (OSC) hearing. The judge found that the dismissal was entered as a result of the mistake of the plaintiff's attorney, and therefore, granted the motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 473. The judge also ordered the plaintiff's attorney to pay $250 to the State Bar Client Security Fund. Additionally, the judge set an OSC regarding why monetary sanctions in the amount of up to $500 should not be imposed on the plaintiff and/or counsel of record for failure to serve the defendant within the time period set forth in California Rules of Court, Rule 3.110(b).
