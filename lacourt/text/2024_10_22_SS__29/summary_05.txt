And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion for issue, evidence, and monetary sanctions filed by the City of Los Angeles against plaintiff Gregory Blaine Heffron. The motion is denied in part and granted in part. The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the court's order to provide a further response was due to a misreading of the order by the plaintiff's counsel, and therefore, the imposition of an issue or evidence sanction would result in an improper windfall to the City. The court grants the request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $570, which is calculated based on two hours of attorney time multiplied by counsel's reasonable billing rate of $285 per hour. The sanctions are imposed solely against the plaintiff's counsel, Christopher Mesaros, Esq.
