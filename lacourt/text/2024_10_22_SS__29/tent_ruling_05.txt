 Case Number:  23STCV02887    Hearing Date:   October 22, 2024    Dept:  29 Heffron v. City
of Los Angeles
23STCV02887
Defendant’s Motion for Issue, Evidence, and Monetary Sanctions 
Tentative
The motion is denied in part and granted in
part.
Background
On February 9, 2023, Gregory Blaine Heffron (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against City of Los Angeles (“City”), Los Angeles Department
of Water and Power (“DWP”), County of Los Angeles (“County”), State of
California (“State”), and Does 1 through 200 for liability of a public
entity under Government Code section 815 and negligence for a scooter accident
occurring on May 13, 2022.
 
On May 15 and 16, 2023, County and State filed
answers.  These defendants were dismissed, at the request of
Plaintiff, on April 19, 2024.
 
On June 26, 2023, City filed an answer (on its own behalf
and acting by and through DWP) and a cross-complaint against Roes 1 through 10.
 
On August 22, 2024, the Court ordered
Plaintiff to provide a further response to City’s Form Interrogatory (Set Two)
17.1 within 15 days of notice.  City
provided notice by electronic means on August 23, 2024.  (Houle-Sandoval Decl., ¶ 13 & Exh. H.)
 
On September 24, 2024, City filed
this motion for issue, evidence, and monetary sanctions.  As of that date, Plaintiff had not provided
the court-ordered response.  (Id., ¶ 15.)
 
On September 23, 2024, one day before
City filed its motion, Plaintiff served the required responses.  (Mesaros Decl., ¶¶ 4, 10 & Exh. A.)  Plaintiff served the responses by mail.  (Id., Exh. A.)
 
Plaintiff filed an opposition to this
motion on October 9.  City filed a reply
on October 15.
 
Legal Standard
When a plaintiff fails to obey an order compelling answers to
interrogatories, “the court may make those orders that
are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction,
or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010).  In lieu of or in addition to,
that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.030 provides
for monetary, evidence, issue, and terminating sanctions for any “misuse of the
discovery process,” “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this title.”  A “misuse of
the discovery process” is defined to include (among other things) failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery; making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to a discovery request; disobeying a court order to provide
discovery; and making or opposing, unsuccessfully, a motion to compel without
substantial justification. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d)-(h).)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and
“incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate
with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser
sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.) 
The
primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil
Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v.
Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super
Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery
sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a
better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery
Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,
1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2024), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
Discussion
Defendant
seeks issue, evidence, and monetary sanctions against Plaintiff arising from
his failure to comply with the Court’s Order of August 22, 2024.
 
The
requests for issue and evidence sanctions are denied.  Plaintiff has served the responses.  The responses were served approximately two
weeks late, but City now has them.  Plaintiff’s
counsel states that the reason for the late response was counsel’s own misreading
of the Court’s order.  (Mesaros Decl., ¶¶
2, 5.)  Under these circumstances, the
imposition of an issue or evidence sanction would result in an improper
windfall to City. 
 
The
request for monetary sanctions is granted. 
Plaintiff disobeyed the Court’s order. 
That is a misuse of the discovery process, for which sanctions are authorized.  Because the mistake was solely that of Plaintiff’s
counsel, sanctions will be imposed solely against counsel. 
 
The
Court sets sanctions in the amount of $570, calculated based on two hours of
attorney time multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $285 per
hour.  (See Houle-Sandoval Decl., ¶ 18.)
 
Conclusion
The Court DENIES the request of Defendant City of Los Angeles for
issue or evidence sanctions.
The Court GRANTS the request of Defendant City of Los Angeles
for monetary sanctions.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff’s counsel Christopher Mesaros, Esq.,
to pay monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act to City of Los Angeles
(through counsel) in the amount of $570 within 30 days of notice.
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
