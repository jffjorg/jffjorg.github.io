21STCV33534
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Deposition of Plaintiff
Tentative
The motion is DENIED without prejudice for
procedural reasons.
Background
On September 10, 2021, Dane Brown (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Edward Buck (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 20 for (1)
sexual battery, (2) assault, (3) battery, (4) hate violence, (5) negligence,
(6) intentional infliction of emotional distress, and (7) human trafficking.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant caused
Plaintiff to overdose on methamphetamines twice in one week in September 2019.  According to the complaint, Defendant was
criminally charged with (among other things) distribution of methamphetamines
resulting in death and convicted in July 2021.
 
Defendant filed his answer on July 13, 2023.
 
Plaintiff initially represented himself, but on February
13, 2024, Plaintiff substituted in counsel.
 
On September 25, 2024, Defendant filed this motion to
compel the deposition of Plaintiff. Defendant filed a notice of non-opposition
on October 15.  
 
Legal Standard
“Any
party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any
person, including any party to the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the
requirements for (among other things) what must be included in a deposition
notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice
must be served.  
“The
service of a deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a
party to the action … to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection
and copying.”  (Id., § 2025.280,
subd. (a).)
Section
2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at
least three days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition
notice does not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through
2025.280.
Section
2025.450, subdivision (a), provides:
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization
that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  
Any
such motion to compel must show good cause for the production of documents and,
when a deponent has failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.”  (Id.,
subd. (b).)  
When
a motion to compel is granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses
of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to
an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Id., § 2023.030,
subd. (a).)
Discussion
Defendant
seeks an order compelling Plaintiff to appear for deposition.
 
On
August 16, 2024, Defendant noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for September 10,
2024.  (Myer Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh.
A.)  Plaintiff did not object to the
notice and did not appear for the deposition. 
(Id., ¶¶ 10 & 14 & Exh. E.)
 
With one
critical exception, Defendant has satisfied all substantive and procedural requirements
for the requested order.
 
Defendant
has not, however, submitted proof that this motion was served on Plaintiff’s
counsel.  The proof of service attached
to the motion is unsigned.
 
Accordingly,
the motion is denied without prejudice on procedural grounds. 
 
Conclusion
 
The Court
DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE Edward Buck’s motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff
Dane Brown.
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
