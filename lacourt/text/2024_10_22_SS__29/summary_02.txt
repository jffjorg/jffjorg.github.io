The defendant had noticed the plaintiff's deposition for September 10, 2024, but the plaintiff did not appear. The defendant has satisfied most of the substantive and procedural requirements for the requested order, but has not submitted proof that the motion was served on the plaintiff's counsel. The judge orders the moving party to give notice.
