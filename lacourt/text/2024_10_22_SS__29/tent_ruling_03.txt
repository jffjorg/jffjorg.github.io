 Case Number:  22STCV16423    Hearing Date:   October 22, 2024    Dept:  29 Miranda v. Melkonian
22STCV16423
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel filed by Anthony T.
Nehme, Esq.
Tentative
The motions as to Plaintiff Ilsa Miranda and Plaintiff
Erick Ojeda are granted.
The motion as to Plaintiff Bryan Miranda is
denied without prejudice for procedural reasons.
Background
On May 17, 2022, Ilsa Miranda, Bryan Miranda,
and Erick Ojeda (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Vardui
Melkonian (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 10 for motor vehicle negligence arising
out of an automobile accident occurring on December 19, 2019. Plaintiffs filed a
First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) on July 17, 2023.
On October 4, 2023, Defendant filed an answer.
In December 2023 and February 2024, Plaintiffs
amended the FAC to name Wanda Ivascyn as Doe 1 and John Ivascyn as Doe 2. 
On March 22, 2024, Wanda Ivascyn and John
Ivascyn filed an answer and cross-complaint against Defendant. The
cross-complaint was dismissed on May 1, 2024.
On September 24, 2024, Anthony T. Nehme, Esq.
(“Counsel”) filed these motions to be relieved as attorney of record for
Plaintiffs.
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Except as set
forth below, the three motions satisfy all applicable substantive and
procedural requirements.  Counsel has
established good cause to be relieved as counsel for all three Plaintiffs.
 
As to Plaintiff
Erick Ojeda, the Court notes that he was a minor at the time of filing but he
has reached the age of majority.
 
As to Plaintiff Bryan
Miranda, however, Counsel did not file and serve a proposed order, as required.  Instead, it appears that Counsel
inadvertently submitted two copies of the declaration supporting the
motion.  
 
Accordingly, the
motions as to Ilsa Miranda and Erick Ojeda are granted.  The motion as to Bryan Miranda is denied
without prejudice.
 
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS
the motions as to Plaintiffs Ilsa Miranda and Erick Ojeda.  The order is effective upon filing with the
Court a proof of service showing service of the signed order (not just the
minute order) on the clients.
 
The Court DENIES
WITHOUT PREJUDICE the motion as to Plaintiff Bryan Miranda.
 
Moving Counsel
to give notice.
