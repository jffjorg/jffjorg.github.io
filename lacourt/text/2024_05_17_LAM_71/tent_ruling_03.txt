1.   
Motion to Compel- FROG
Having reviewed Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Responses to Plaintiff’s FROG,
the Court rules as follows.
           On or about February 14,
2024, Plaintiff served FROG on Busoni. 
(Decl. of Dreblow ¶7, Exh. E.)  Defendant’s
deadline to respond was March 16, 2024.  Plaintiff
provided Defendant with two extensions of time to respond, with her final
deadline falling on April 16, 2024.  (See
Decl. of Dreblow ¶8, Exh. F.)  Despite
Defendant confirming receipt of the FROG and Plaintiff providing her with
multiple extensions to the deadline to respond to the FROG, Defendant has failed
to respond, forcing Plaintiff to bring the instant Motion.  (Decl. of Dreblow ¶8, Exh. F.)  Plaintiff now moves to compel responses.  
           Plaintiff’s motion to
compel responses is granted pursuant to C.C.P. §2030.290(b).  Busoni
is ordered to provide verified responses to Plaintiff’s FROG compliant with
C.C.P. §§2030.210(a) and 2030.220 without objections within 20 days.
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions totaling $1,665.00 against Busoni. 
           The
Court awards sanctions pursuant to C.C.P. §2030.290(c) in the amount of $595.00,
calculated as follows:
(1 hour to prepare instant
motion x $535.00) + $60.00 filing fee = $595.00

The sanctions are payable by
Busoni within 20 days of this order.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling.

Compel- RFP

(Decl. of Dreblow ¶7, Exh. E.)  Defendant’s deadline to respond was March 16,
2024.  Plaintiff provided Defendant with
two extensions of time to respond, with her final deadline falling on April 16,
2024.  (See Decl. of Dreblow ¶8,

receipt of the RFP and Plaintiff providing her with multiple extensions to the
deadline to respond to the RFP, Defendant has failed to respond, forcing
Plaintiff to bring the instant Motion.
