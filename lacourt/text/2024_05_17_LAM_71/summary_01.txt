And here is a summary in English text:

This document is a tentative ruling by a judge in a lawsuit between Markella Thanou, Amalia Thanou, and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The lawsuit is based on the medical treatment and care of Demetrios Fotinatos, who died as a result of the defendant's negligence. The defendant demurred to the plaintiffs' complaint, alleging that the complaint failed to state a cause of action for medical negligence. The court sustained the demurrer with 10 days leave to amend. The defendant's motion to strike portions of the complaint was denied as moot. The plaintiff Markella moved for trial preference, which was continued to June 10, 2024, at 8 a.m. The court ruled that the plaintiff's motion was not supported by sufficient evidence of her advanced age and health issues, and therefore required supplemental briefing on this matter.
