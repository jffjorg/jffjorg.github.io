 Hearing
  Date:  May 17, 2024



 
The Court denies
Plaintiff’s default judgment packet.  
The
Court sets a hearing on an order to show cause why the complaint should not be
dismissed and/or Plaintiff’s counsel sanctioned $250 for failing to enter
default judgment (California Rule of Court, rule 3.110(h)) on July 2, 2024, at
8:30 AM in Department 71 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse for the following reasons:

1.   
Declarations do not properly lay the
foundation for the exhibits to support damages.
 
2.   
Plaintiff does not demonstrate evidence
in support of claim for damages for fraud in the amount of $50,000.00.
 
3.   
No summary of the case.
 
4.   
Plaintiff has not shown liability as to
each defendant and the recovery is not duplicative.
 
5.   
Plaintiff’s interest calculation is at
10% but Plaintiff does not provide a contract to support the request for breach
of contract.  If Plaintiff seeks to
recover damages based on its open book account cause of action, the interest
calculation must be at a rate of 7%. 
(See Civ. Code §§3287 et seq.; Cal. Const. art. 15, §1.)
