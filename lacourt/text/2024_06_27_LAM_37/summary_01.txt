And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction to quash and recall a writ of execution issued by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California. The plaintiff, Zohreh Khabushani, had filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and had a default judgment entered against her in 1996. The judgment was reduced to $500,000 in a settlement agreement in 2012. Defendant Najila Kordrostam Brent had continued to try to collect on the judgment, and the plaintiff had filed a motion for preliminary injunction to stop the collection efforts. The court found that it did not have jurisdiction to quash and recall the writ of execution issued by the bankruptcy court, as the Stipulated Judgment of the parties provided that the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California had the exclusive jurisdiction to determine any disputes regarding the judgment. The court concluded that the plaintiff had failed to show that it had jurisdiction to grant the requested preliminary injunction and therefore denied the motion.
