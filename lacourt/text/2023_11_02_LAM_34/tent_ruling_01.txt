ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Request
for Judicial Notice
 
Defendant requests that the Court take judicial notice of the Complaint
and the Answers filed in this matter. 
 
The Court DENIES as superfluous judicial
notice to all these items. Any party that wishes to draw the Court’s attention
to a matter filed in this action may simply cite directly to the document by
execution and filing date. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1110(d).)
 
II.      
Legal
Standard
 
“A written agreement to submit to arbitration an
existing controversy or a controversy thereafter arising is valid, enforceable
and irrevocable, save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any
contract.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.)
 
“On petition of a party to an arbitration agreement
alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and
that a party to the agreement refuses to arbitrate that controversy, the court
shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if
it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists [unless it
makes certain determinations].” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2.)
 
“Under both federal and state law, arbitration
agreements are valid and enforceable, unless they are revocable for reasons
under state law that would render any contract revocable. . . . Reasons that would render any
contract revocable under state law include fraud, duress, and
unconscionability.” (Tiri v. Lucky Chances, Inc. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th
231, 239, citations omitted.)
 
“The party seeking to compel arbitration bears the
burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of an
arbitration agreement.¿The party opposing the petition bears the burden of
establishing a defense to the agreement's enforcement by a preponderance of the
evidence.¿In determining whether there is a duty to arbitrate, the trial court
must, at least to some extent, examine and construe the agreement.” (Tiri,
supra, at p. 239.)
 
III.    
Discussion
 
A.      The
Parties’ Arguments
 
Defendant moves the Court to compel Plaintiff to arbitration and
stay this action pending the completion of arbitration. (Memorandum, p.
11:4–5.) 
 
Defendant argues: (1) that the arbitration provision exists, and
requirements for its authentication and foundation have been met; (2) that
Plaintiff’s claims are subject to arbitration under the Federal Arbitration
Act; (3) that the arbitration provision is valid and enforceable; (4) that
Defendant may compel arbitration of Plaintiff’s claims because such claims are
encompassed by the arbitration provision; (5) that the question of
arbitrability is for the arbitrator to decide; and (6) that the claims should
be stayed pending completion of arbitration. (Memorandum, pp. 5:2, 5:23, 6:16,
7:14–15, 9:5, 10:7.)
 
Plaintiff disagrees, arguing: (1) that Defendant cannot compel
arbitration because Plaintiff’s negligent repair cause of action is no longer
at issue in this case; (2) that Defendant may not rely on equitable estoppel to
force Plaintiff to arbitration; and (3) that Defendant is not a third-party
beneficiary of the arbitration provision. (Opposition, pp. 8:21–22, 8:27, 9:1,
13:28, 14:1.)
 
In its Reply, Defendant argues: (1) that state law governs the
enforcement of the arbitration provision, not federal law; (2) that there are
no material differences between this action and Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020)
53 Cal.App.5th 486; and (3) that Plaintiff’s claims are intimately intertwined
with the sale contract. (Reply, pp. 1:18, 2:25, 5:1.)
 
B.      Discussion
 
The situation here – where a non-signatory automobile manufacturer
attempts to compel a consumer to arbitration when the signatory dealership is
not a party to the action, whether by omission or dismissal – is akin to the situation
in Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, review pending
at Ochoa v. Ford Motor Co.) 
 
To summarize the holding of this case:  (1) equitable estoppel does not apply because
the manufacturer has not shown that the claims against it are founded in or
intertwined with the sale contract; (2) the manufacturer’s warranty outside of
the contract is not a part of the sales contract; (3) the manufacturer is not a
third-party beneficiary of the sale contract; and (4) there is no agency
connection that gives the manufacturer the right to compel arbitration as an
undisclosed principal. (Ford Motor Warranty Cases, supra, 89
Cal.App.5th at pp. 1332, 1335, 1336, 1340.)
 
The Ford Motor Warranty Cases is currently citable for its
persuasive value and to allow the Court to exercise discretion under Auto
Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court (1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 456.   Further,
several recent cases have agreed with the holdings in the Ford Motor
Warranty Cases. These cases include: Montemayor v. Ford Motor Co. (2023)
92 Cal.App.5th 958, 968, 972; Kielar v. Superior Court (2023) 94
Cal.App.5th 614, 620–621; and Yeh v. Superior Court (2023) 95
Cal.App.5th 264, 269–279.
 
The Court finds that the facts in this case are closer to those in
the Ford Motor Warranty Cases and its progeny, than with Felisilda v.
FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486.
 
 
IV.     
Conclusion
 
The Motion is DENIED.
