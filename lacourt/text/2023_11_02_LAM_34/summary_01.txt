And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied the Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings filed by Nissan North America, Inc. and LAD-N, LLC. The case involves a dispute between the defendants, who are seeking to compel the plaintiff, Irma Santos, to arbitrate her claims arising from a breach of express warranty, fraudulent inducement by intentional misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement by concealment, and negligent repair. The defendants argue that the arbitration provision in the sale contract is valid and enforceable, while the plaintiff argues that the claims are not subject to arbitration. The Judge finds that the facts in this case are similar to those in the Ford Motor Warranty Cases, where a non-signatory automobile manufacturer attempted to compel a consumer to arbitration. The Judge concludes that the defendants cannot compel arbitration as an undisclosed principal and denies the Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings.
