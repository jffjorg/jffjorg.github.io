And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for a protective order, which sought to limit the scope of a deposition and stay the deposition altogether. The defendants argue that the deposition should be limited to matters related to causation, speed, damage to vehicles, injuries, and conversations at the scene of the accident, since they have already admitted fault. However, the judge finds that the defendants have not shown good cause for granting the motion, citing the liberal policies surrounding discovery in California. The judge notes that the defendants have only made bare assertions that the deposition is "irrelevant, oppressive, or unduly burdensome" and that they have not demonstrated that the deposition would be longer and more expensive for the sake of eliciting irrelevant information. The judge concludes that the defendants' motion is premature and unjustified and should not be granted. The defendants must submit Murray Dennis Jr. for deposition within 14 days of the hearing.
