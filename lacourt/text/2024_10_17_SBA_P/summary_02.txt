And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiffs' request for punitive damages in its entirety without leave to amend. The motion was filed on March 18, 2024, in response to the plaintiffs' complaint filed on January 1, 2024. The complaint alleges causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and wrongful death, but does not allege that the defendants acted in an oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious manner. The Judge found that the plaintiffs' allegations do not support a prima facie claim for punitive damages and that the request for punitive damages is therefore improper. The Judge noted that the parties met and conferred on the deficiencies in the complaint, but were unable to reach an agreement. The Judge also found that there is no possibility of successful amendment of the complaint to maintain a request for punitive damages.
