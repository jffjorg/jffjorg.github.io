```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is overruled. The defendant had argued that the plaintiff's allegations were too vague and uncertain, making it impossible for the defendant to respond. However, the judge found that the plaintiff had provided sufficient information for the defendant to fashion discovery responses to elicit the information it sought. The judge also noted that demurrers for uncertainty are disfavored and strictly construed, and that ambiguities can reasonably be clarified through modern rules of discovery. As a result, the defendant is ordered to answer the complaint within 10 days.
