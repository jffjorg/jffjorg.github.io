Background
            On March 2, 2023, Plaintiff
Christopher Birt (“Plaintiff”) filed this complaint against Defendant Open Sky
Real Estate LLC (“Defendant”) and DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, alleging causes
of action for (1) violation of Los Angeles Municipal Code, §§ 151.04/ 151.10
and (2) Declaratory Relief.
            Plaintiff alleges the following: Defendant
is the owner and manager of the property where Plaintiff resides and/or
otherwise participates in collecting rent and profits from Plaintiff.
(Complaint, ¶ 6.) Plaintiff is (or was) a tenant residing in a rental unit
exempt from the Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance (“LARSO”), located at
2129 ½ S. Beverly Glen Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90025 (the “Subject Premises”). (Id.
¶ 11.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant demanded excess rent by demanding,
accepting, or retaining: (1) a rent increase during a 12-month period exceeding
the maximum allowable percentage increase permitted under LARSO; (2) multiple
rent increases within a 12-month period, impermissible under LARSO; (3) an
unpermitted late fee; (4) a Systematic Code Enforcement Fee (“SCEP”) during the
first year of the tenancy; (5) monthly rent increases calculated by including
SCEP as part of the maximum adjusted rent, rather than the base rent; (6) a
rental increase for additional occupants more than 60 days after the Landlord’s
actual or constructive knowledge of the additional occupants. (Id., ¶
15(a)-(f), (k).) Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant failed to timely serve a
written notice of the SCEP fee, annual registration surcharge, and rental
amount increases. (Id., ¶ 15(g)-(i).) Plaintiff further alleges that
Defendant charged utility charges without a contractual basis or without a
written agreement related to the division of charges on a property with a
single meter. (Id., ¶ 15(l).) 
            On
March 24, 2023, Defendant filed its verified answer to the complaint, asserting
factual denials and nine affirmative defenses.
On April 3,
2023, Defendant filed its verified amended answer to the complaint.
            On
June 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of related case (Case No. 22SMUD01405, Open Sky Real Estate LLC v. Christopher Co.) 
            On
August 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment, or in the
alternative, motion for summary adjudication, concurrently with a separate
statement and request for judicial notice. 
On August 27,
2023, Defendant filed an opposition, dated August 2, 2024. The electronic
filing of the opposition is at issue in the motion before the court.
On August 29,
2024, the court granted Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment, directing
Plaintiff to submit a proposed judgment. 
On September 6,
2024, Defendant filed this motion for reconsideration, and, to correct clerical
mistake, concurrently with a proposed order. 
On September
16, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. No reply was filed prior to the
October 1, 2024, motion hearing.
 
Legal Standard
Code of
Civil Procedure § 1008(a) permits a motion for reconsideration but requires
that the moving party “shall state by affidavit what application was made
before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new
or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.”
The
requirements for motions for reconsideration do not apply where the prior
ruling was not on the merits. Clausing v. San Francisco Unified School Dist.
(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 1224, 1232; Chambreau v. Coughlan (1968) 263
Cal.App.2d 712, 718.
"A
motion for reconsideration may only be brought if the party moving for
reconsideration can offer 'new or different facts, circumstances, or law' which
it could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced at the
time of the prior motion.... A motion for reconsideration will be denied absent
a strong showing of diligence." Forrest v. Dept. Of Corps. (2007)
150 Cal.App.4th 183, 202, disapproved on other grounds by Shalant v. Girardi
(2011) 51 Cal.4th 1164, 1172. See also Baldwin v. Home Sav. of Am.
(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1192, 1199 (noting that 1992 amendment to Code Civ.
Proc., § 1008 tightened diligence requirements). Disagreement with a ruling is
not a new fact that will support the granting of a motion for reconsideration. Gilberd
v. AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500
 
 
Discussion
            Procedural Issues
            Timeliness
A formal notice of ruling is required to
set the time limit running to file a motion for reconsideration. The 10-day
time limit runs from service of notice of entry of the order. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1008(a).)
The court directed Plaintiff to provide
notice and submit a proposed judgment of the Order Re: Ruling on Motion for
Summary Judgment on Defendant on August 29, 2024. Plaintiff did not file proof
of service of entry of the order. Defendant filed the instant motion for
reconsideration on September 6, 2024, five court days after the order was
posted. Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion is timely.
Affidavit
Failure to file an affidavit with a motion
under Section 1008(a) is fatal to that motion. (Branner v. Regents of
University of California (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1043, 1048.) Defendant did
not file an affidavit setting forth the required affidavit. Defendant simply
attached the proof of service. This is insufficient. Defendant’s motion for
reconsideration has not satisfied all the procedural requirements. 
Nonetheless, the court will exercise its
discretion and consider the motion for reconsideration on the merits.
 
Motion
for Reconsideration
            Defendant Open Sky Real Estate LLC
(“Defendant”) moves for reconsideration of the court’s grant of Plaintiff
Christopher Birt’s (“Plaintiff”) motion for summary judgment (the “MSJ”).
Alternatively, Defendant moves the Court for an order correcting the clerical
mistake of electronically entering Defendant’s opposition to Plaintiff’s MSJ on
August 27, 2024, instead of August 2, 2024. (Motion, pp. 1-2.) The order in
question was made by the Honorable Judge Mel Red Recana for Stanley Mosk
Courthouse, Department 45. (Order Re: Ruling on Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary
Judgment (Notice of Ruling) 8/29/24.) 
As
such, this is the proper court and Judge to bring forth the instant motion.
            Defendant argues that the Court has
the power and should exercise that power to correct a clerical error that
occurred when counsel for Defendant electronically filed the and served by U.S.
mail, the opposition papers on August 2, 2024, and the electronic filing was
not processed on August 2, 2024, instead appearing in the court records as
filed on August 27, 2024. (Motion, p. 5:9-14.)
CCP 473(d) provides, “The court may, upon
motion of the injured party, or its own motion, correct clerical mistakes in
its judgment or orders as entered, so as to conform to the judgment or order
directed” and covers all errors, mistakes, or omissions which are not result of
exercise of judicial function. (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 473(d); Est. of
Douglas, 83 Cal. App. 5th 690, 299 Cal. Rptr. 3d 692 (2022).) If an error,
mistake, or omission is the result of inadvertence, but for which a different
judgment would have been rendered, the error is “clerical” and judgment may be
corrected. (Id.) 
Defendant argues that new facts warrant
reconsideration by the Court of its grant of Plaintiff’s MSJ on the grounds
that no opposition was filed. Defendant asserts that it did not learn of the
electronic filing issue until the day of the hearing because the court issued
the tentative ruling prior to the hearing. (Motion, p. 6; Declaration of Arye
C. Abraham (Abraham Decl., ¶ 4.) Defendant further asserts that counsel for
Plaintiff, Lawrence Adamski, experienced difficulties communicating with the
court and had no opportunity to address the issue of the untimely e-filing at
the time of the hearing. (Motion, pp. 6-7.) The court notes that Plaintiff’s
counsel Adamski checked in with the Judicial Assistant, but when the case was
called, counsel did not respond or participate in the hearing. (8-29-24 Minute
Order.)
Defendant’s motion for summary opposition,
as reflected in the court’s records, is dated August 2, 2024, and is accompanied
by the declaration of defense counsel and a proof of service evidencing service
by U.S. Mail to the same address which Defendant previously served its verified
answer to the complaint on March 21, 2023, and Amended verified answer to the
complaint on April 3, 2023. The opposition was addressed to the following
address:
 
Kevin Hermansen,
State Bar No. 266254 
Jacob Woocher, State Bar No. 339780 
B A S T A, Inc. 
1545 Wilshire Blvd, Suite 600 
Los Angeles, CA 90017
(MSJ
Opposition, P.O.S.) Counsel for Plaintiff argues that all discovery was served
electronically, and that its office never received Defendant’s opposition by
mail. (Declaration of Jacob Woocher (“Woocher Decl.”) ¶¶ 6-7.)
            In opposition, Plaintiff raises
procedural arguments, which are addressed above. Plaintiff further contends
that Defendant has failed to present “new” or “different” facts to justify
reconsideration. (Opposition, p. 2; Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 674, 690.) Specifically, Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s motion
for reconsideration is also devoid of factual statements because Defendant
failed to submit a separate statement of disputed facts.  (Id., p. 6; Cal Civ. Proc. § 437c(b)(3.)
 Plaintiff argues that despite having over
one year to file an opposition to the MSJ, Plaintiff and Defense counsel spoke
over the phone on August 14, 2024, and Defense counsel stated that he was
“finishing up the opposition”. (Woocher Decl. ¶ 5.) 
The Court finds that even if a clerical
error occurred that caused the opposition not to be accepted on the August 2,
2024, stated date, it is incumbent on the opposing party to take corrective
measures as soon as the mistake is discovered, or take account for failing to
follow up. The Court notes that the MSJ hearing judgment occurred on August 29,
2024. Plaintiff filed the MSJ on September 25, 2023. Under Cal. Civ. Code §
437c (b), Defendant’s opposition was due by August 15, 2024, giving Defendant
two weeks ahead of the opposition filing due date, and two weeks ahead of the
hearing to correct this issue and bring it to the attention of the court. Plaintiff
argues that Defense counsel could have filed an ex parte application to
continue prior to the hearing on the motion. (Opposition, p. 2.) The court
agrees. At the latest, Defendant had the opportunity to raise this issue during
the August 29, 2024, hearing, however Defendant’s counsel was not present
during the hearing. Counsel for Plaintiff appeared during the hearing and
Soheila Lalehzarzadeh (In Pro Per) appeared for Arye C. Abraham. (8-29-24
Minute Order.) The court finds that Defendant failed to demonstrate that a
clerical error existed, and that Defendant exercised the diligence required to
grant a Motion for Reconsideration.
Therefore, the Court DENIES
Defendant Open Sky Real Estate LLC’s order for reconsideration of the Plaintiff
Christopher Birt’s granted motion for summary judgment.
Therefore, the Court DENIES Defendant
Open Sky Real Estate LLC’s order correcting a clerical mistake.
                        
            It is so ordered.
