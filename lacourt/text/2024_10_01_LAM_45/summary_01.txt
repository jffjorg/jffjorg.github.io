Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for reconsideration of the court's grant of the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. The defendant had argued that a clerical error occurred in the electronic filing of its opposition to the plaintiff's motion, and that this error prevented it from submitting a timely opposition. The judge found that the defendant failed to demonstrate that a clerical error existed, and that the defendant did not exercise the diligence required to grant a motion for reconsideration. The judge also denied the defendant's request to correct the clerical mistake. The defendant's motion for reconsideration was based on the argument that it did not learn of the electronic filing issue until the day of the hearing, and that it was unable to file a timely opposition due to this mistake. The judge found that the defendant had ample opportunity to correct the issue before the hearing, but failed to do so. As a result, the judge denied the defendant's motion for reconsideration and the correction of the clerical mistake.
