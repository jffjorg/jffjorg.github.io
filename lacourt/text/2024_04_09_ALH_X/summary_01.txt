And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

"On April 9, 2024, Judge Joel L. Lofton issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ik Hoon Choi and Hannah Choi v. Filippo Marchino. The plaintiffs had moved for sanctions against the defendant for failing to produce deposition testimony. The court denied the motion, finding that while the defendant had failed to respond to the plaintiffs' attempts to schedule a deposition, the plaintiffs had also failed to make any further efforts to contact the defendant after January 11, 2024. The court noted that the parties had discussed potential deposition dates, but the defendant and witness Allison Klein had not made any attempt to contact the plaintiffs' counsel. The court also cited California law requiring an incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with terminating sanctions. The judge reminded the parties that the trial date is two weeks away and offered to assist in settling the matter."
