RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Plaintiffs move for an order
imposing monetary and evidentiary sanctions.
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This claim arises out of Plaintiffs Ik Hoon
(“Ik Hoon”) Choi and Hannah Choi (“Hannah”) (collectively “Plaintiffs”) claim
that Defendant Filippo Marchino’s (“Defendant”)  dog bit plaintiff Ik Hoon. Plaintiffs filed
their complaint on September 4, 2023. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Plaintiffs’ motion for sanctions is DENIED.
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiffs move for sanctions against Defendant for failing to produce
Allison Klein for deposition testimony. 
 
            Section
2023.030 authorizes a trial court to impose
monetary sanctions, issue sanctions, evidence sanctions, or terminating
sanctions against ‘anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery
process.’ ” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors,
Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 991.) “The discovery
statutes evince an incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with
monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Id.
at p. 992.)
 
            On
September 11, 2023, this court granted Plaintiffs’ motion to compel the
deposition testimony of Allison Klein. Plaintiffs’ counsel provides that the
parties discussed potential deposition dates. (Hoffman Decl. ¶¶ 7-10.) Plaintiffs’ counsel provides that he left messages
requesting dates on January 4, 2024, January 9, 2024, and January 11, 2024. (Id.
¶ 12.) In opposition, Defendant and Klein contend that Plaintiffs failed to
make any contact after the January 11, 2024, messages. However, Defendant and
Klein do not contend that they made any attempt to contact Plaintiffs’ counsel.
 
            Klein
contends that their conduct was permissible because the court’s previous order
did not set a specific date for deposition. However, “[c]ivil discovery is
intended to operate with a minimum of judicial intervention. ‘[I]t is a
“central precept” of the Civil Discovery Act ... that discovery ‘be essentially
self-executing[.]’ ” (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 402.) In the current
case, Klein and Defendant failed to respond to Plaintiffs’ counsel’s attempt to
schedule a deposition and waited seven months before agreeing to a deposition
date of April 3, 2024. (Davis Decl. ¶ 4.)
 
            Nonetheless,
the court denies Plaintiffs motion for sanctions, and Klein’s opposing request
for sanctions. The court assumes that the deposition has already been completed
by the time of this hearing.  The court
reminds the parties that the FIRM[1] trial date is two weeks away.  Please let the court know if it can be of
assistance in settling the matter.
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiffs’ motion for sanctions is DENIED.
