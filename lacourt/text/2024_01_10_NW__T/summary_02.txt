And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the Defendant, Irina Grinblat, against the Second Amended Cross-Complaint filed by the Plaintiff, Mahtab Gharachehdagy. The Court has sustained the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend. The Plaintiff's claim for declaratory relief is insufficient because it fails to identify the specific written instrument or contract involved and does not demonstrate the existence of an actual controversy. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff's claim for breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment is insufficient because it fails to provide additional factual evidence to support the claim. The Court distinguishes the case from Dolnikov v. Ekizian (2013) and concludes that the Plaintiff's pleading is insufficient to establish a cause of action. The Court orders the Plaintiff to amend the pleading to address the deficiencies.
