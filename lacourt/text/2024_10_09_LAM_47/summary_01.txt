And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the plaintiff's motions in limine and has issued the following tentative rulings:

1. The motion to preclude the defendant from raising affirmative defenses not asserted in answer is denied without prejudice.
2. The motion to exclude evidence not disclosed during discovery is denied without prejudice.
3. The motion to exclude undesignated witnesses and undisclosed expert witness testimony is denied without prejudice.
4. The motion to exclude evidence of the plaintiff's receipt of collateral source benefits is granted to the extent that there is evidence that the plaintiff received such payments.
5. The motion to exclude evidence of the plaintiff's arrest and felony conviction is granted.

The Court finds that the defendant's failure to assert affirmative defenses in answer does not waive the right to raise such defenses at trial. The Court also finds that the plaintiff has not demonstrated a right to an exclusion order based on the defendant's failure to disclose discovery. The Court has discretion to exclude expert witness testimony under Evidence Code § 352, but finds that the potential probative value of the testimony is outweighed by the potential prejudice to the plaintiff and the likelihood that its admission would confuse and/or mislead the jury.

The Court also finds that the collateral source rule applies to exclude evidence of the plaintiff's receipt of collateral source benefits, including unemployment benefits, disability payments, and workers' compensation benefits. The Court concludes that the receipt of such benefits is a collateral source and should not be used to offset any damages sought by the plaintiff.

Finally, the Court finds that the 1996 arrest, conviction, and related evidence should be excluded under Evidence Code § 352, as the potential probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the potential prejudice to the plaintiff and the likelihood that its admission would confuse and/or mislead the jury.
