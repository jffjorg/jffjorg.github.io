Motion for Preliminary Injunction
 
Plaintiff moves for a preliminary
injunction precluding Defendant Marques “and any alter egos” from encumbering,
selling, or otherwise disposing of certain real properties in her possession
which are located at 6620 West 5th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90048 and 2922
Montana Avenue, Unit A, Santa Monica, CA 90403.
 
Legal Standard
 
            “A party
who originally made an application for an order which was refused in whole or
part, or granted conditionally or on terms, may make a subsequent application
for the same order upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, in which
case it shall be shown by affidavit what application was made before, when and
to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new or different
facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
1008(b).) 
 
A party may request a preliminary injunction “by serving a
noticed motion,” as Plaintiffs have in this case, when the party against whom
the preliminary injunction is sought has appeared in the action. (Cal. Rule of
Court 3.1150(a).) 
 
“An injunction is a writ or order requiring a person to
refrain from a particular act.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 525.) “A preliminary
injunction may be granted at any time before judgment upon a verified
complaint, or upon affidavits if the complaint in the one case, or the
affidavits in the other, show satisfactorily that sufficient grounds exist
therefor.” (Code Civ. Proc.§ 527(a).) An injunction may be granted in the
following cases:    
 
(1) When it
appears by the complaint that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded,
and the relief, or any part thereof, consists in restraining the commission or
continuance of the act complained of, either for a limited period or
perpetually.  
 
(2)¿When it
appears by the complaint or affidavits that the commission or continuance of
some act during the litigation would produce waste, or great or irreparable
injury, to a party to the action. 
 
(3)¿¿When
it appears, during the litigation, that a party to the action is doing, or
threatens, or is about to do, or is procuring or suffering to be done, some act
in violation of the rights of another party to the action respecting the
subject of the action, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual. 
 
(4) When pecuniary compensation would not afford adequate
relief.  
 
(5) Where
it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the amount of compensation which
would afford adequate relief.  
 
            . . . . 
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 526(a)(1)-(5).) 
 
In deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction, two
factors must be considered prior to issuing a preliminary injunction: (1) the
balance of the harm to the applicant should the injunction not issue, compared
to the harm to the enjoined party should the injunction issue; and (2) whether
the applicant is ultimately likely to prevail on the merits. (Common Cause
v. Board of Supervisors (1989) 49 Cal.3d 432, 441442.)  A trial court
has broad discretionary powers to grant or deny a request for a preliminary
injunction if it does not act capriciously.  The court should exercise its
judgment in favor of the party most likely to be injured. (Robbins v.
Superior Court (1985) 38 Cal.3d 199, 205.)  In addition, the two
factors are interrelated: the greater the Plaintiff’s showing as to one of the
factors, the less that must be shown as to the other factor. (Butt v. State
of California (1992) 4 Cal.4th 668, 678.) 
 
Analysis
 
            Plaintiff
seeks a preliminary injunction precluding Defendant Marques “and any alter
egos” from encumbering, selling, or otherwise disposing of certain real
properties in her possession which are located at 6620 West 5th Street, Los
Angeles, CA 90048 and 2922 Montana Avenue, Unit A, Santa Monica, CA 90403. These
properties are alleged to have been purchased using monies which were
wrongfully obtained from Plaintiff. (SAC p.6:12-15.) 
 
            Plaintiff,
through his counsel, asserts that the extensive history of this case demonstrates
that Plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits of his claim and that
allowing Defendant to encumber these properties would greatly endanger
Plaintiff’s ability to recover for the damages claimed because they represent
Defendant’s only substantial assets. In support of these contentions, Plaintiff
relies principally on (1) comments by Judge Hammock after the presentation of
evidence to the jury and after the jury verdict; (2) the Court’s prior issuance
of Temporary Restraining Orders; and (3) the Court of Appeal’s review of the
record of the previous trial. While these materials suggest the existence of
evidence tending to prove the merits of Plaintiff’s claims, they do not carry
Plaintiff’s burden to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits because
they are not themselves evidence. Comments by a judge are not evidence of the
merits of the case. Temporary Restraining Orders are not evidence of the merits
of the case. The Court of Appeal’s recitation of the evidence presented in a
trial which it subsequently vacated is certainly not evidence of the merits of
the case. Further, the assertions of Plaintiff’s counsel that there is “zero
doubt” that Defendant will encumber or otherwise dispose of the properties at
the earliest opportunity is not evidence of the risk of injury to Plaintiff if
the injunction does not issue, and Plaintiff offers no other competent evidence
of this contention. (Declaration of Allain v. Bonavida ISO Mot. ¶ 5.) 
 
            In sum,
Plaintiff has failed to present to the Court the evidence necessary to
demonstrate that a preliminary injunction is proper. 
 
Conclusion
 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction is DENIED. 
 
Motion for Leave to File Lis Pendens
 
            Plaintiff
moves for leave of Court to record a Notice of Pendency of Action (lis pendens)
against the properties located at 6620 West 5th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90048
and 2922 Montana Avenue, Unit A, Santa Monica, CA 90403. 
 
A lis pendens is a recorded
document that gives constructive notice that an action affecting title or right
to possession of real property has been filed, and may be filed by any party
that asserts a real property claim to that real property. (Kirkeby v.
Sup. Ct. (2004) 33 Cal.4th 642, 647.) A person with an interest in the
affected real property can petition the court to expunge the lis pendens. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 405.30.) The court must order the lis pendens expunged if it finds
that (a) there is no real property claim, (b) the claimant did not establish by
a preponderance of the evidence the probable validity of the real property
claim, or (c) adequate relief can be secured by giving an undertaking. (Code
Civ. Proc. §§ 405.31- 405.33.) A real property claim is a cause of action that,
if successful, would affect title to or the right of possession of specific
real property or the use of an easement identified in a
pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 405.4.) Once a notice of lis pendens is
expunged, a new notice may only be recorded with leave of court. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 405.36.) 
 
Plaintiff previously recorded lis
pendens against the two properties that are the subject of this motion, but
both were expunged on August 21, 2015. (Defendant’s RJN Exh. 2.) Plaintiff
therefore requires leave of Court to record a new lis pendens against either
property. (Code Civ. Proc. § 405.36.) Neither party references any legal
authority establishing a standard for granting such relief, and the Court has
not independently uncovered any relevant authority on that point. However, the
absence of legal authority is secondary to the complete absence of any evidence
in Plaintiff’s papers demonstrating that a new lis pendens should be permitted.
Plaintiff’s motion rests on the same contentions and filings as his request for
preliminary injunction—i.e., on bald assertions by his counsel, comments by
Judge Hammock, the Court’s Temporary Restraining Orders, and the Court of
Appeal’s recitation of the now-vacated trial. These materials are not evidence.

 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion for
Leave to Record Lis Pendens is DENIED.
 
CONCLUSION:

 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion for
Preliminary Injunction is DENIED.
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File
Lis Pendens is DENIED.
 
Moving Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
