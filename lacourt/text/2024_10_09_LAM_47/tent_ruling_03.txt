CASE:                         Megan Mitchell v. Del Taco, LLC
 
CASE NO.:                 22STCV35386            
 
MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL

 
MOVING PARTY:               Attorney Ben Rothman, Counsel for Plaintiff
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): No response on
eCourt as of 10/07/24
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an employment discrimination action that was filed on November 7,
2022. Plaintiff alleges that she was harassed based on her race. 
 
Attorney Ben Rothman, counsel for
Plaintiff, moves to be relieved as counsel. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorney Ben Rothman, counsel for
Plaintiff, moves to be relieved as counsel. 
 
Moving counsel filed all three required forms (MC-051,
-052, and -053). Moving counsel filed all three required forms (MC-051, -052,
and -053) and filed proofs of service with the Court. Moving counsel served the
motion on Plaintiff by mail at her last known address but was not able to
confirm that the address was current despite calling her last known phone
number, sending the papers to her last known address return receipt requested,
and conducting internet searches. (MC-052 ¶ 3(b).) Moving Counsel states that
Plaintiff’s phone is out of service, and her email address is out of storage
space. (Id.)  
 
In general, an attorney may withdraw with
or without cause so long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice
to the client’s interest – i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in
the litigation, because that would prejudice client, but can withdraw
otherwise. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904,
915.) The court has discretion to deny an attorney’s request to withdraw where
the withdrawal would work an injustice or cause undue delay in the proceeding,
but the court’s discretion in this area is one to be exercised reasonably. (Mandell
v. Superior Court (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.)   
 
            Here, trial in this matter is not
set as the parties executed a stipulation to arbitrate on February 16, 2023. The
only other hearing on calendar is a Status Conference Re: Arbitration set to
coincide with this hearing. The risk of prejudice to Plaintiff is therefore
low. Moving Counsel states that withdrawal is necessary because his ability to
represent Plaintiff has become unreasonably difficult, and the arbitrator
instructed Moving Counsel to first seek relief from the Court. (MC-052 ¶ 2.) In
light of the low risk of prejudice to the parties at this juncture, the Court
finds that Moving Counsel has demonstrated good cause for withdrawal. 
 
            Accordingly,
Attorney Ben Rothman, Counsel for Plaintiff’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel
is GRANTED. 
 
            This
ruling is conditioned on Moving Counsel giving notice to all parties and filing
proof of service with the Court. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
