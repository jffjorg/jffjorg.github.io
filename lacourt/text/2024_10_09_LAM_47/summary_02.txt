And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's demurrer to the complaint. The defendant had argued that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, but the judge found that the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to state a cause of action for defamation, false light invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The judge also found that the defendant is not immune from liability under the Communications Decency Act, as the defendant is alleged to have created and developed the defamatory content rather than merely distributing it. The judge's tentative ruling is subject to modification based on any submissions from the parties.
