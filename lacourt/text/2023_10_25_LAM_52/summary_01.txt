And here is the summary in English text:

The court issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to tax costs in the case of Dora Hernandez v. Massive Prints, Inc. The court granted the motion in part, taxing $119,112.14 in costs to the plaintiff. The costs included filing and motion fees, jury fees, deposition costs, service of process, witness fees, court reporter fees, models, etc., and other expenses. The court found that the plaintiff's section 998 offer was invalid because it was made too early and did not provide sufficient information to allow the defendant to intelligently evaluate it. The court also found that the plaintiff's claims for disability discrimination and failure to accommodate did not involve personal injury, and therefore did not qualify for prejudgment interest under Civil Code section 3291.
