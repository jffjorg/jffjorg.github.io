And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied defendant A. Julia Gomez's motion to strike portions of plaintiff Oscar Alberto Servellon Torres's complaint. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant knew about repeated cockroach infestations at the apartment he rented from her and failed to remediate the unsafe conditions despite repeated notices from government entities. The plaintiff also alleges that he suffered health problems due to the infestations and that the defendant's conduct was despicable, malicious, or oppressive. The Judge has ruled that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the defendant's conduct was despicable, malicious, or oppressive, and therefore denies the motion to strike. The defendant is ordered to answer within 20 days.
