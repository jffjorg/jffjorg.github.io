ORDER REGARDING DEFENDANT’S
  MOTION TO TAX COSTS
 
 



 
Defendant
Massive Prints, Inc. moves to tax costs stated in plaintiff Dora Hernandez’s memorandum
of costs.
I.          Basis
for Recovering Costs
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1032,[1]
the prevailing party is entitled to recover costs.  (§ 1032, subd. (b).)  The Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) independently
provides that “the court, in its discretion, may award to the prevailing party,
including the department, reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, including
expert witness fees.”  (Gov. Code, §
12965, subd. (c)(6).)
            Section 1033.5, subdivision (a) sets forth a list of
allowable costs.  Section 1033.5,
subdivision (b) lists costs that are not allowable.  “ ‘An item not specifically allowable under
subdivision (a) nor prohibited under subdivision (b) may nevertheless be
recoverable in the discretion of the court if “reasonably necessary to the
conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its
preparation.” (§ 1033.5, subd. (c)(2).)’ ” 
(Sanford v. Rasnick (2016) 246
Cal.App.4th 1121, 1128 (Sanford).)  All costs awarded by the court must be
reasonable and necessary.  (7 Witkin,
Cal. Procedure (5th ed. 2008) Judgment, § 118, pp. 657-658.) 
            If the items on a memorandum of costs appear proper on
their face, the prevailing party has produced prima facie evidence the costs
were reasonable and necessary (Seaver v.
Copley Press, Inc. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1550, 1557 (Seaver); Doe v. Department of
Children & Family Services (2019) 37 Cal.app.5th 675, 693), and the
burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show otherwise.  (Sanford,
supra, 246 Cal.App.4th at p. 1128;
accord Benach v. County of Los Angeles (2007)
149 Cal.App.4th 836, 855 [If the claimed costs are expressly allowable, “ ‘the
burden is on the objecting party to show them to be unnecessary or
unreasonable’ ”].)  “[I]t is not enough
for the losing party to attack the submitted costs by arguing that he thinks
the costs were not necessary or reasonable. 
Rather, the losing party has the burden to present evidence and prove
that the claimed costs are not recoverable.” 
(Seaver, at p. 1557.) 
            A.        Filing and Motion Fees
            Plaintiff’s memorandum of costs claims $3,502.28 in
expenses under category 1, filing and motion fees.  Defendant moves to tax $2,733.18 of these
costs.  It argues many of the costs are
not “filing and motion fees” paid to the court under section 1033.5,
subdivision (a)(1).  The memorandum of
costs, however, constitutes prima facie evidence that these expenses were “[f]ees
for the electronic filing or service of documents through an electronic filing
service provider” under subdivision (a)(14). 
Even if some of these expenses are not included in any category of
expressly recoverable costs, plaintiff shows they were reasonably necessary to
the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial.
B.        Deposition
Costs
            A prevailing party may recover costs of “[t]aking, video
recording, and transcribing necessary depositions, including an original and
one copy of those taken by the claimant and one copy of depositions taken by
the party against whom costs are allowed.” 
(§ 1033.5, subd. (a)(3)(A).)       
Defendant
moves to tax $122.40 plaintiff claims in this category paid to Bolster Legal
Services to summarize a deposition transcript. 
Plaintiff agreed to withdraw that expense.  (Opp., p. 4.) 

            Defendant also moves to tax $861.20 for the deposition of
Francine Herard as duplicative.  Attachment
4e to the memorandum of costs includes two relevant entries: (1) “06/19/2023
Barkley Court Reporters Depo of PMK Francine Heard 9/30/20 $702.85”, and (2) “09/30/20
Francine Heard $861.20.”  Plaintiff shows
she paid both expenses: $702.85 for a certified copy of the deposition
transcript and $861.20 for the original. 
(Anglin Decl., Ex. 5.)  Section
1033.5, subdivision (a)(3)(A) expressly allows both. 
            C.        Service
of Process
            Defendant moves to tax several items plaintiff claims in
category 5, service of process.  A
prevailing party may recover costs for “[s]ervice of process by a public
officer, registered process server, or other means.”  (§ 1033.5, subd. (a)(4).)
            Defendant challenges $231.50 plaintiff claims for service
of process on defendant’s counsel Pfaster & Berman and $212.00 plaintiff
claims for service of process on defendant’s counsel William Bloch.  (Memo. of Costs, § 5.a & b.)  Plaintiff presents an invoice from All City
Legal & Messenger Services dated May 18, 2023, for $443.50 for ‘service of
court documents.”  (Anglin Decl., Ex.
6.)  
That
was not “service of process.”  That was service
of “[n]otices or other papers.”  (§
1010.)  “Service of process” is a term of
art limited to a summons or other means of acquiring personal jurisdiction over
the person served.  (See §§ 415.20,
416.20, 416.40, 416.90; Bus. & Prof. Code, § 22350, et seq. [requirements
for registered process servers]; Gov. Code, § 26660, subd. (a) [“ ‘Process’
includes all writs, warrants, summons, and orders of courts of justice, or
judicial officers” in statutes regarding service by sheriff].)  The court will tax these costs.
            Defendant Massive Prints, Inc. also moves to tax $555.57
for service of process on former co-defendant Oasis Outsourcing, Inc.  Plaintiff dismissed Oasis Outsourcing as a
defendant.  As “a defendant in whose
favor a dismissal is entered,” Oasis Outsourcing is a prevailing party.  (§ 1032, subd. (a)(4).)  The opposition provides no authority
permitting a plaintiff who prevails against one defendant to recover costs exclusively
attributable to the plaintiff’s action against a different, prevailing
defendant.  The court will tax this cost.
            Finally, defendant moves to tax $441.75 claimed for
service of subpoenas on witnesses Maria Rosales, Dr. Musher, and Shane Oliver
because plaintiff did not call them to testify at trial.  That plaintiff ultimately did not call these
witnesses does not make the expenses unreasonable or unnecessary.  Plaintiff reasonably incurred the cost of
serving subpoenas on these witnesses to preserve the ability to present their
testimony.  
            D.        Ordinary Witness Fees
            Defendant moves to tax $3,500 claimed as an “ordinary
witness fee” for Dr. Marc Arnush.  That
is not an “ordinary witness fee[] pursuant to Section 68093 of the Government
Code.”  (§ 1033.5, subd. (a)(7).)  Plaintiff explains she paid that amount
because Dr. Arnush’s “employer required that Plaintiff pay the doctor’s hourly
fee …
in order that Dr. Arnush be
allowed to be off work and for the day.” 
(Anglin Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. 9.)  
Plaintiff
served a subpoena on Dr. Arnush.  (Memo.
of Costs, att. 5.d.)  “The process by
which the attendance of a witness is required is the subpoena.  It is a writ or order directed to a person and
requiring the person’s attendance at a particular time and place to testify as
a witness.”  (§ 1985, subd. (a).)  Serving a subpoena on Dr. Arnush sufficed to
require him to appear at trial.  That
plaintiff agreed to pay his employer thousands of dollars it was not entitled
to was at most merely convenient to plaintiff. 
The court will tax this cost.
E.         Expert Witness Fees
Defendant
moves to tax all $18,495.83 plaintiff claims for expert witness fees.  “Fees of experts not ordered by the court”
are “not allowable as costs, except when expressly authorized by law.”  (§ 1033.5, subd. (b)(1).)  Government Code section 12965, subdivision
(c)(6) expressly gives courts discretion to award “expert witness fees” to a
prevailing plaintiff.  The court
exercises its discretion to do so.  Though
the jury did not ultimately award damages based on these experts’ testimony,
that does not retroactively make them unnecessary.  It was reasonably necessary for plaintiff to
incur these expenses in attempting to recover additional damages.
            F.         Models,
Enlargements, and Photocopies
            Defendant moves to tax $4,588.21 plaintiff claims for
models, enlargements, or photocopies of exhibits.  A prevailing party may recover costs for
models, enlargement of exhibits, and photocopies of exhibits “if they were
reasonably helpful to aid the trier of fact.” 
(§ 1033.5, subd. (a)(13).)  The
court concludes plaintiff’s exhibits were reasonably helpful to aid the trier
of fact.  Any costs in this category not
expressly allowable were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation.
            G.        Court Reporter Fees
            Defendant moves to tax $87,018.89 in court reporter
fees.  In general, “[c]ourt reporter fees
as established by statute” are allowable costs. 
(§ 1033.5, subd. (a)(11).) 
Pursuant to Government Code section 68086, a party may retain a court
reporter to serve as the official reporter pro tempore where, as here, the
court does not provide one.  (Gov. Code,
§ 68086, subd. (d)(2).)  The fees for
these services are recoverable. (Ibid.) 
By contrast, court reporter fees for transcription are not recoverable
unless ordered by the court.  (§ 1033.5,
subd. (b)(5).)
            Defendant argues plaintiff cannot recover these costs
because they are for “[t]ranscripts of court proceedings not ordered by the
court.”  (§ 1033.5, subd. (b)(5).)  It is true that plaintiff’s invoices include
transcripts, but they also include recoverable court reporter fees.  As to the cost of the transcripts, the court
exercises its discretion to award these expenses under Government Code section
12965, subdivision (c)(6).  The court
finds all expenses plaintiff claimed in this category were reasonably
necessary.         
            H. Messenger, Investigations, Trial Technician 
            Defendant moves to tax $42,227.52 in costs plaintiff
claims for delivering copies, “investigative services,” parking and mileage,
hearing transcripts, and for “Gold Trial Services.”  (Memo. of Costs, att. 16.a.)  The court exercises its discretion to award
these costs.  All were reasonably
necessary to trying this case.  
            The fee of $29,590 for Gold Trial Services was
reasonable.  Plaintiff paid “a technician
… to assist the trial attorney with the presentation of evidence and to set up,
manage and operate the monitors and electronic databases for presentation of
evidence using Trial Director” software. 
(Anglin Decl., ¶ 24.)  “Use of
such technology, including a technician to monitor the equipment and quickly
resolve any glitches, has become commonplace, if not expected by jurors.”  (Green v. County of Riverside (2015)
238 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1374.)  Such an
expense also constitutes “electronic presentation of exhibits, including costs
of rental equipment and electronic formatting.” 
(§ 1033.5, subd. (a)(13).)   Based
on its observations during trial, the court finds the equipment and service
used here materially improved the presentation of plaintiff’s evidence and the
jury’s ability to understand it.  This
expense was not merely convenient or beneficial to plaintiff’s case, it was
reasonably necessary.  
I.          Prejudgment Interest 
            Finally, defendant moves to tax $114,490.67 in
prejudgment interest.  Plaintiff relies
on Civil Code section 3291 and her section 998 offer to recover prejudgment
interest.  “Civil Code section 3291
mandates the award of prejudgment interest in ‘any action brought to recover
damages for personal injury sustained by any person resulting from or
occasioned by the tort of any other person ...,’ where the defendant has
rejected the plaintiff's settlement offer under Code of Civil Procedure section
998 and the plaintiff then obtains a more favorable judgment.”  (Bihun v. AT&T Information Systems,
Inc. (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 976, 1001, (Bihun) disapproved on other
grounds in Lakin v. Watkins Associated Industries (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644,
664.)
                        1.         Is this an “action brought to recover
damages for personal injury”?
Plaintiff
may not recover prejudgment interest because this was not an “action brought to
recover damages for personal injury” under Civil Code section 3291.  “[T]he language of the statute reveals that
the Legislature was seeking to restrict prejudgment interest in a particular
type of award, ostensibly to encourage early settlement and to compensate
injured plaintiffs for the unfair withholding of insurance proceeds.”  (Gourley v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.
(1991) 53 Cal.3d 121, 129–130.)  “ ‘The
Legislature intended different treatment of personal injury actions because of
the manifest greater prejudice of delay in recovering personal injury damages
as compared to contractual or business-tort losses given the probability
personal injury plaintiffs are likely to be physically as well as monetarily
impaired.’ ”  (McKinney v. California
Portland Cement Co. (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1231.)  “[I]n analyzing whether an action falls
within the ambit of section 3291 a court must focus on the nature of the tort
rather than the type or extent of the damages suffered in the particular case.”  (Holmes v. General Dynamics Corp.
(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1418, 1437 (Holmes).)
            The Court of Appeal has held
that “a sexual harassment claim under FEHA seeks to vindicate decidedly
personal rights” and thus “comes within the ambit of Civil Code section
3291.”  (Bihun, supra, 13
Cal.App.4th at p. 1005.)  The court
reasoned,  
“ ‘ “An injury is personal
when it impairs the well-being or the mental or physical health of the victim.”
’  [Citations.]  It is beyond dispute sexual harassment in the
workplace has this effect.  As one
commentator familiar with the subject put it, ‘[Sexual] harassment exists in
terribly harsh, ugly, demeaning, and even debilitating ways.... It is a form of
violence against women as well as a form of economic coercion... .’  [Citation.] 
The mere fact sexual harassment occurs in the workplace does not convert
the invasion of a personal right into the invasion of an economic one.  ‘The gravamen of any sexual harassment claim
is that the alleged sexual advances were “unwelcome.” ’ ”  (Ibid.)  The court further stated that sexual
harassment constitutes “violation of the personal right to be free from
unwanted and unwelcome sexual advances.” 
(Ibid.)  
            For wrongful termination claims, however, the Court of
Appeal has held Civil Code section 3291 does not apply.  In Holmes, the court stated, “[W]e
cannot say that a tortious wrongful termination action is one to recover
personal injury damages within the meaning of the statute.  A wrongful termination claim primarily
involves the infringement of property rights, not personal injury.”  (Holmes, supra, 17 Cal.App.4th at p.
1436.)  “[T]he nature of a tortious
wrongful termination action is not to vindicate the plaintiff’s personal
interest.  Rather, the essence of such
claim is to vindicate the public interest.” 
(Ibid.)  Distinguishing Bihun,
the court noted “it is the employer's violation of a public policy
resulting in the loss of a tangible economic benefit (a job), rather
than the invasion of a personal freedom interest, which primarily defines the
action.”  (Id. at p. 1437, fn. 15;
accord Rodriguez v. Cho (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 742, 754 [following Holmes
when interpreting phrase “personal injury” in section 425.11].)
            This action is analogous to one for wrongful
termination.  Plaintiff did not bring a
claim for harassment based on any protected status, let alone sexual harassment.  In contrast with discrimination, which concerns unequal terms and conditions
of employment, “harassment focuses on situations in which the social
environment of the workplace becomes intolerable because the
harassment (whether verbal, physical, or visual) communicates an offensive
message to the harassed employee.”  (Roby
v. McKesson Corp. (2009) 47 Cal.4th 686, 706.)  It occurs when the defendant subjects the
plaintiff to “discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is
sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s
employment and create an abusive working environment.”  (Rehmani v. Superior Court (2012)
204 Cal.App.4th 945, 951.)  
Moreover,
even if plaintiff had alleged harassment, her complaint arose from the protected
classes of age, disability, and engaging in protected activity under FEHA.  (Comp., ¶¶ 12-17.)   Any
harassment claim therefore would not have involved “ ‘violence against women’ ”
or “violation of the personal right to be free from unwanted and unwelcome
sexual advances.”  (Bihun, supra, 13
Cal.App.4th at p. 1005.)  
The
opposition argues, “Plaintiff prevailed at trial on her claims for failure to
engage in the interactive process and failure to accommodate.  These claims involve injury to the person and
are not property rights or interests that inure to the public.  In fact, the essence of these claims is the
failure to accommodate a personal injury that is a disability and to fail to
engage in an interactive process with the employee regarding accommodations for
the disability.”  (Opp., p. 14.)  The essence of these claims arises from the
right to “reasonable accommodation for the [employee’s] known physical or
mental disability” (Gov. Code, § 12940, subd. (m)(1), italics added), regardless
of whether that disability arises from any “personal injury.”  That plaintiff’s disability arose from an
injury does not change “the nature of the tort.”  (Holmes, supra, 17 Cal.App.4th at p.
1437.)  
Unlike
harassment, plaintiff’s claims concern the process of accommodating employees
for the sole purpose of helping them do their jobs.  (See Gov. Code, § 12926, subd. (p) [defining
“Reasonable accommodation”].)  To be
protected under FEHA, an employee with a disability (or “personal injury”) must
be able “to perform the employee’s essential duties.”  (Gov. Code, § 12940, subd. (a)(1).)  “Although section 12940 proscribes
discrimination on the basis of disability, it expressly limits the reach of
that proscription, excluding from coverage those persons who are not qualified,
even with reasonable accommodation, to perform essential job duties.”  (Zamora v. Security Industry Specialists,
Inc. (2021) 71 Cal.App.5th 1, 39.)  “An
applicant or employee has the burden of proof to establish that [he or she] is
a qualified individual capable of performing the essential functions of the job
with or without reasonable accommodation.” 
(Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, § 11066(a).) 
That plaintiff’s claims would not apply to an employee whose “personal
injury” is so severe that she cannot work supports the conclusion that an
action for failure to accommodate disability and failure to engage in the
interactive process is not “brought to recover damages for personal injury.”  (Civ. Code, § 3291.)
Like
wrongful termination, the primary purpose of these claims is to vindicate the
public interest in permitting disabled people to work and to protect employees’
property rights related to their employment. 
Though plaintiff ultimately recovered only emotional distress damages, the
“court must focus on the nature of the tort rather than the type or extent of
the damages suffered in the particular case.” 
(Holmes, supra, 17 Cal.App.4th at p. 1437.)    
            Moreover, regardless of the claims on which she
ultimately prevailed, plaintiff’s section 998 offer proposed a settlement
shortly after filing her initial complaint. 
The initial complaint’s first cause of action alleged “discrimination
based on actual and/or perceived disability.” 
(Comp., p. 6.)  Plaintiff alleged
her disability was a substantial motivating factor “in the discriminatory and
retaliatory treatment [s]he was subjected to, as herein alleged, including the
termination of her employment.”  (Id.,
¶ 21.)  The seventh cause of action
alleged “wrongful and tortious discharge” (id., p. 14) arising from “terminating
Plaintiff’s employment” (id., ¶ 53). 

This
action was not brought to recover damages for personal injury.  Civil Code section 3291 does not apply.
            2.         Was
plaintiff’s section 998 offer valid?
Even
if plaintiff had brought an “action to recover damages for personal injury”
under Civil Code section 3291, she could not recover prejudgment interest
because her section 998 offer was invalid.  “A 998 offer is valid only if . . . the
offeror knew that the offeree had reasonable access to the facts necessary to
‘intelligently evaluate the offer.’ ”  (Licudine
v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2019) 30 Cal.App.5th 918, 921 (Licudine).)  In making this determination, “three factors
are especially pertinent: (1) how far into the litigation the 998 offer was
made; (2) the information available to the offeree prior to the 998 offer’s
expiration; and (3) whether the offeree let the offeror know it lacked
sufficient information to evaluate the offer, and how the offeror
responded.”  (Ibid.)  
            The first two factors weigh heavily
against plaintiff.  Generally, if a
section 998 offer is made at the time the lawsuit is filed or soon thereafter,
the offeree is less likely to have sufficient information upon which to
evaluate it.  (Licudine, supra, 30
Cal.App.5th at p. 925; Najera v. Huerta (2011) 191 Cal.App.4th 872,
875 [receiving offer at same time complaint is served].)  Plaintiff’s proof of substituted service on
defendant Massive Prints, Inc. states defendant was served on October 15,
2019.    
Plaintiff served
her section 998 offer only three days later on October 18, 2019.  (Anglin Decl., Ex. 2.)  
Defendant
had little information available to evaluate the offer.  “[T]he offeree needs information bearing on
the issue of liability as well as on the amount of damages because these are
the issues upon which a verdict would rest and because the 998 offer, if
accepted, would be in lieu of that verdict.” 
(Licudine, supra, 30 Cal.App.5th at p. 925.)  The offer expired before defendant had time
to conduct any discovery.  Defendant had some
information relevant to liability.  But
for the amount of damages, defendant had minimal information.  
Defendant’s human
resources director, Francine Herard, states, “At the time the Section 998 offer
was served, October 18, 2019, Massive Prints had no details on any economic
losses Ms. Hernandez might be claiming.  We
knew from the workers compensation case that there was no significant emotional
distress being claimed, and Ms. Hernandez’s injury claims seemed very
suspicious, if not exaggerated, and her pain claims seemed to migrate to
different areas of her body, depending on what she was claiming on any particular
day.”  (Herard Decl., ¶ 6.)  Defendant also necessarily knew how much it
paid plaintiff before terminating her but had no way of knowing about
plaintiff’s earnings after that.  Aside
from this information, defendant had notice only of the complaint’s boilerplate
allegations that plaintiff “has suffered and continues to suffer, substantial damages
including, but not limited to loss of wages as well as other job benefits,
humiliation, embarrassment, mental and emotional distress and discomfort as
well as an aggravation and/or exacerbation of her disabilities in an amount to
be proven at trial.”  (Comp., ¶ 33.)
            Only the third factor favors
plaintiff.  Nothing in the record shows
defendant told plaintiff it lacked sufficient information to evaluate the offer
or that it asked for more information. 
Defendant instead asserts that its former counsel served with the 998
offer never presented it to Massive Prints, Inc.  (Herard Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, 7.)  
            After evaluating all relevant
factors, the court concludes defendant met its burden of showing the offer was
invalid.  Plaintiff argues the $75,000
offer was a “bargain compared to the outcome of the trial.”  (Opp., p. 8.) 
That may be so in hindsight.  The
reasonableness of the offer must be evaluated “in light of the circumstances
‘at the time of the offer’ and ‘not by virtue of hindsight.’ ”  (Licudine,
supra, 30 Cal.App.5th at
p. 924.)  Based on the circumstances at
the time, plaintiff’s section 998 offer was not a good faith offer to compromise.  She made it too early to permit defendant to
intelligently evaluate it.  Plaintiff
strategically served it right away to either get an easy settlement before
defendant knew what it was up against, or so it would be rejected and therefore
maximize plaintiff’s potential benefits under section 998 and Civil Code
section 3291.  The court therefore will
tax $114,490.67 in prejudgment interest.
