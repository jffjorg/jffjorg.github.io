English-text summary:

The judge issued a tentative ruling in a case where the plaintiff has alleged disability discrimination against the individual defendants. The court has determined that the individual defendants may not be liable for the sixth cause of action, and has set an order to show cause to determine whether the individual defendants can be held liable. The defendants argued that the plaintiff has not and cannot state a disability discrimination cause of action against the individual defendants, and the plaintiff did not dispute this argument. The court has also noted that the plaintiff's counsel has failed to respond to the substance of the court's order to show cause, and has appeared to tacitly concede that their cause of action against the individual defendants is without merit. The court has discharged the order to show cause and has not dismissed the individual defendants at this time, but has reminded the plaintiff's counsel that bringing or maintaining a claim that is not "warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law" is sanctionable conduct. The court also noted that the prevailing party may be awarded reasonable attorney's fees and costs, including expert witness fees, except that a prevailing defendant shall not be awarded fees and costs unless the court finds the action was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless when brought, or the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.
