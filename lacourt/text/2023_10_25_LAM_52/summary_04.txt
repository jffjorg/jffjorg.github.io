And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by Barsala, Inc. and Ronald Pescador. The defendants have moved for summary judgment or summary adjudication of each cause of action alleged by the plaintiffs, Hector Jr. Beltani and Breeana Linn Odell.

The judge has concluded that the defendants have met their burden of showing that the plaintiffs cannot succeed on any cause of action. The plaintiffs' claims arise from the theft of their personal property from a rental unit, and the judge has found that the rental agreement limits liability for stolen property. The judge has also found that the defendants did not personally interfere with the plaintiffs' property or otherwise intentionally harm them.

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, and has ordered them to submit a proposed judgment for the court's signature forthwith. The judge has also denied the plaintiffs' request for a continuance to finalize and review ongoing discovery, as the plaintiffs have not presented a sufficient affidavit showing that facts essential to justify opposition may exist.
