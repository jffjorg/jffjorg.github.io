Role:
- Judge: (unspecified)
Significant Statements:
- "Generally, '[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.'"
- "Here, there is no violation of any Court order at this time. Further, even if the February 6, 2024 was construed as an order granting the stipulation, it does not appear that there was a willful violation of that stipulation."
```

And here is the English-text summary:

The defendant seeks terminating or evidentiary sanctions against the plaintiff, alleging that the plaintiff violated a February 6, 2024 court order. However, the court finds that the defendant's representations are incorrect and the court did not grant a motion to compel, but rather the parties stipulated to a mental independent medical examination (IME). Despite the plaintiff's refusal to participate in the IME, the court does not find a willful violation of the court order and denies the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions or in the alternative, issue and/or evidentiary sanctions.
