 Case Number:  21STCV45082    Hearing Date:   April 19, 2024    Dept:  30 DAVID LONG vs GUO TAO RUANTENTATIVEDefendant’s motion for terminating sanctions or in the alternative, issue and/or evidentiary sanctions is DENIED. Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.Request for Judicial NoticeDefendant seeks judicial notice of: (1) Defendant’s motion for leave to perform a mental examination of Plaintiff; (2) Defendant’s supplemental declaration re motion for leave to perform a mental examination of Plaintiff; (3) Defendant’s notice of ruing re motion to compel.The request is GRANTED as to the existence of these documents, but not to the truth of the matters asserted within the documents. (Sosinsky v. Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1565).Legal StandardCCP section 2023.030 provides that, "[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method..., the court, after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose... [monetary, evidence, and terminating] sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process...." CCP section 2023.010 provides that "[m]isuses of the discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following:... (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.... (g) Disobeying a court order to provide discovery....""The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse 'after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.'" (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390 (quoting Lang v. Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246).) "Generally, '[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.'" (Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 (citation omitted).)"Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders." (Id. (citing Lang, supra, 77 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244- 1246); see, e.g., Collisson X Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 (terminating sanctions imposed after defendants failed to comply with one court order to produce discovery); Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231 Cal App 3d 481, 491 (disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCucchen (1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4) (terminating sanctions imposed against plaintiff for failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating various discovery statutes).)DiscussionDefendant moves for terminating sanctions, or in the alternative, issue and/or evidentiary sanctions on the ground that Plaintiff violated this Court’s February 6, 2024 order. Defendant argues that on February 6, 2024, this Court granted Defendant’s motion to compel a mental independent medical examination (IME) with Defendant’s designated neuropsychologist expert Dr. April Thames. On February 21, 2024, Dr. Thames attempted to conduct the ordered mental examination. Plaintiff obstructed the mental examination by refusing to: complete the tests, discuss his complaints in a straightforward fashion, activate his camera, and verify whether he was alone or accompanied by another individual.The Court disagrees with Defendant’s representations as it relates to the February 6, 2024 minute order. The Court did not grant any such motion to compel. Rather, the Court stated that the parties represented that the motion was no longer necessary, and that they stipulated to the IME instead. (2/6/24 Minute Order.)The imposition of terminating sanctions is a drastic measure which should be employed with caution. (See¿Deyo¿v. Kilbourne¿(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 793.) Here, there is no violation of any Court order at this time. Further, even if the February 6, 2024 was construed as an order granting the stipulation, it does not appear that there was a willful violation of that stipulation. Rather, it may appear he is being difficult, which will bear upon his credibility at trial. Plaintiff did appear for the IME, and thus, it does not appear his actions are willful defiance. Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions or in the alternative, issue and/or evidentiary sanctions is DENIED.
