```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the arguments presented by the parties and has made several tentative rulings. First, the judge accepts an explanation provided by Doe regarding the late filing of his reply, and finds that USC has suffered no prejudice as a result. Second, the judge grants USC's request for judicial notice of certain minute orders from prior hearings. However, the judge declines to judicially notice a minute order from the instant case, finding that the court can review the file itself. Third, the judge overrules USC's written objection to a declaration and allows the parties to present evidence at the upcoming hearing. Finally, the judge notes that the parties are not limited to the administrative record, but that evidence subsequent to the agency decision is of limited value. The judge also declines to draw any conclusions from a timeline of events presented by the parties, and will consider the evidence presented at the hearing in making a final ruling.
