And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving Wilmington and Vermont. The judge notes that both counsel failed to provide courtesy copies of their papers, as required by the Presiding Judge's First Amended General Order. The judge admonishes counsel to provide these copies in the future. The judge also rules on Wilmington's written evidentiary objections and directs the clerk to scan and electronically file the court's rulings. The judge addresses Wilmington's argument that Vermont's objection to the injunction bond is untimely, finding that Vermont is complaining about the ex parte appointment bond, not the preliminary injunction bond. The judge also dismisses Wilmington's remaining argument that Vermont's motion is an untimely motion to reconsider.
