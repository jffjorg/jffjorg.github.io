Doe’s reply was served on December 30, 2024, one court day after it was due on
December 27, 2024 under the expedited briefing schedule.  Doe explains that USC served a new and
different administrative record on December 20, 2024 which affected the already
shortened time for his reply.  Although
the reply was not actually filed until January 6, 2025, the court accepts this
explanation and USC has suffered no prejudice.


[2] USC
requests judicial notice of: (1) an October 9, 2024 minute order from a hearing
before Commissioner Laura Cohen (RJN Ex. A); (2) this court’s October 22, 2024 minute
order (RJN Ex. B); (3) a December 19, 2024 minute order from a hearing before
Commissioner Cohen (RJN Ex. C).  Exhibits
A and C are judicially noticed.  Evid.
Code §452(d).  There is no need to
judicially notice a minute order from the instant case (Ex. B).  A court can always review the instant court
file.


[3] It
appears that some or all of the evidence in Doe’s formal complaint was
presented for his challenge to the Emergency Removal Order.


[4]
USC’s written objection to this declaration is overruled.  The statement is received for notice and
impact on the parties.  Moreover, this
case lies in traditional mandamus and the parties are not limited to the Administrative
Record, although evidence subsequent to the agency decision is of limited value.


[5]
Doe makes no argument that USC failed to follow its own procedure or otherwise
were unlawful or procedurally
unfair.  


[6]The
timeline is as follows.  Roe first raised
specific concerns that she had been sexually assaulted by Doe on September 13,
2024.  USC AR 36-38.  Doe first raised unspecified concerns against
Roe two days later, on September 15, 2024. 
USC AR 54-56.  Doe was arrested
after a pretext phone call on September 16, 2024.  AR 103.  
Roe filed a formal complaint against Doe on September 18, 2024.  USC AR 195-97.   The court also granted the TRO against Doe
on September 18, 2024.  AR 186-94.  The Emergency Removal Order was upheld on
September 30, 2024.  AR 234-35.  Doe filed a formal complaint against Roe on
October 16, 2024.  USC AR 236-38.  
While
this timeline shows that Roe was ahead of Doe in making accusations, Doe argues
that Roe only began to remember details of the August 30 events on September
13, 2024, after she became concerned that Doe was angry with her.  AR 209.  He notes that they spoke for four hours the
next morning, August 31, 2024, and almost daily thereafter, and also spent at
least 12 hours a week in class sitting next to each other, more hours in their
study group, and directly messaged frequently.  AR 209-18, 219-54.  Reply at 4-5. 
The court draws no conclusions from the timeline.
