And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the motion for a protective order brought by the Defendants, San Gabriel Transit Inc., Access Services, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and Steve Ly. The motion was opposed by the Plaintiffs, Jose Preciado and Aline Preciado, who filed a First Amended Complaint alleging injuries arising from an accident on October 13, 2021. The Judge found that the Defendants did not make a good faith effort to meet and confer before bringing the motion, and that the motion itself was unnecessary and caused further delay. The Judge also denied the Defendant's request for monetary sanctions and granted the Plaintiffs' request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $961.65. The Judge ordered the Defendants to pay the sanctions and attorney's fees, and also ordered the parties to meet and confer before the hearing date.
