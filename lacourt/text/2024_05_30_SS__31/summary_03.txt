And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiff, Olmes Edmundo Arias. The defendants seek to file a cross-complaint for comparative indemnity and declaratory relief, arguing that they were not certain of the plaintiff's liability and comparative fault until after discovery and the accident investigation. The plaintiff opposes the motion, citing delay in seeking leave to file the cross-complaint. The court finds that the motion must be granted unless bad faith of the moving party is demonstrated, and since there is no evidence of bad faith, the motion is granted. The defendants are ordered to file a separate copy of their proposed cross-complaint within five days of the date of the order.
