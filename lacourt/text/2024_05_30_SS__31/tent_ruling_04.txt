MOTIONS TO COMPEL Defendant Miguel Dejesus Cruz Moreno, (“Defendant”) propounded set one of form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and demand for production of documents on plaintiff Edwin Rene Guzman (“Plaintiff”) on April 28, 2023. Plaintiff has not served responses to date. Defendant therefore seeks an order compelling Plaintiff to respond, without objections, to the outstanding discovery and to pay sanctions.  Any opposition was due on or before May 16, 2024; none have been filed.  Therefore, because the evidence shows Plaintiff was properly served with discovery and failed to timely respond, any objections have been waived. Defendant’s unopposed motions are GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses to Defendant’s (1) form interrogatories, set one, (2) special interrogatories, set one, and (3) demand for production of documents, set one, all without objections, within twenty (20) days.

Proc., § 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c).)¿Plaintiff did not file any opposition. However, sanctions may be awarded, even though no opposition was filed, pursuant to CRC 3.1348(a). Defendant seeks sanctions in the amount of $310 for each motion to compel.    Defendant is awarded one hour for each motion to compel, and one hour to appear at the hearing (awarded only once), at the requested rate of $125 per hour for a total of $500 in attorney’s fees.
