And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to compel Plaintiff Kenyce Smith and Abigail Grey's mental examination. The defendant, Uber Technologies, sought to compel the examination to evaluate Plaintiff's claims of traumatic brain injury, depression, and emotional distress. However, the court finds that Uber did not establish good cause for the examination, as it did not file a reply to Plaintiff's contention that the examination location is more than 75 miles away from Plaintiff's residence. The court also notes that Uber delayed in seeking leave for a second examination. As a result, the motion is denied.
