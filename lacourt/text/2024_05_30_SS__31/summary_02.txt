The tentative ruling is a decision made by Judge Michelle C. Kim regarding a motion to continue the trial date for the case of Carlos Francisco Chevez vs. Mohammed Ruhul Amin and Day & Nite Mini Mart & Grocery. The trial was initially set for June 21, 2024, but the defendant, Day Nite Mini Mart, moved to continue the trial date by four months to October 21, 2024. The court finds good cause to grant the motion due to the pending physical examination of the plaintiff, pending depositions of the plaintiff's treating physicians, and the need for further discovery. The court grants the motion and continues the trial date to October 21, 2024.
