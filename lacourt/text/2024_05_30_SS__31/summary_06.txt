And here is the English text summary of the tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling addresses the defendants' motions to compel further responses from the plaintiffs, as well as the defendants' request for sanctions. The plaintiffs, Zhaohui Wang, Liyuan Chang, Yijun Zhong, and Yuanyuan Zhou, are suing California Parking Systems Inc., Juan Ramon Mejia Hernandez, and Does 1 to 50 for damages arising from a motor vehicle accident. The defendants have filed eight motions to compel further responses, and the court has advanced the hearing dates. The court finds that the plaintiffs' refusal to provide timely responses was due to a breakdown in communication, but this is not a reasonable excuse. The court grants the defendants' request for sanctions in the amount of $400 per motion to compel further, totaling $3,200. The court also orders the plaintiffs to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,600 each.
