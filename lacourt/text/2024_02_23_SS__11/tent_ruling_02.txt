The Water Board’s order is called the Revised Cleanup and Abatement Order
(“RCAO”).
 


[2] Barclay claims
overlap exists because “Barclay could be put in a position to argue that there
was potentially more than one ‘occurrence’—essentially, that Barclay’s actions
in developing the Kast site possibly caused pollution in more than one way.”  (Opposition, p. 14.)  Barclay says“[t]his position is directly
contrary to the position that Barclay must take in the Shell lawsuit, in
which Barclay has always maintained that it had nothing to do with polluting
the land (i.e., that there are no ‘occurrences’).”  (Ibid., underlined case name added.)
 
Since
overlapping factual issues still exist, the Court agrees with Barclay and finds
that Barclay’s argument shows prejudice.
