And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendants' motion to lift the stay as to their first, second, third, and fourth arguments. The stay will remain in place for these arguments because the factual issues overlap with the underlying action and the court must consider collateral estoppel. The court will decide the defendants' fifth argument at the hearing. If the defense attorneys fail to establish that the contribution claims can be adjudicated solely by considering the policies and the Shell complaint, the court will deny the motion and maintain the mandatory stay. If the defense attorneys establish their argument, the court will lift the stay. The court finds that the prejudice analysis weighs in favor of Barclay Hollander Corp. for the first, second, third, and fourth arguments, and in favor of the defendants for the contribution claims. The court denies the request for discovery as to the first, second, third, and fourth arguments, and will decide the request for discovery regarding the contribution claims at the hearing.
