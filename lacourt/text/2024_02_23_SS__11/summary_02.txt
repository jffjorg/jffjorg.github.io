  - Barclay: plaintiff arguing overlapping factual issues

Significant Statements:
  - "Barclay could be put in a position to argue that there was potentially more than one 'occurrence'â€”essentially, that Barclay's actions in developing the Kast site possibly caused pollution in more than one way."
  - "Barclay's position is directly contrary to the position that Barclay must take in the Shell lawsuit, in which Barclay has always maintained that it had nothing to do with polluting the land (i.e., that there are no 'occurrences')."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling that Barclay's argument shows prejudice because of overlapping factual issues between the current case and the Shell lawsuit. The judge finds that Barclay's actions in developing the Kast site may have caused pollution in more than one way, which conflicts with Barclay's previous position in the Shell lawsuit that it had no involvement in polluting the land. As a result, the judge agrees with Barclay that the overlapping factual issues create prejudice and will not enforce the Revised Cleanup and Abatement Order (RCAO) at this time.
