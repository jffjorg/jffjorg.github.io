Here is the summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in YAML format:

**Case Information**

* Case Number: BC653918
* Hearing Date: January 23, 2024
* Department: 51
* Judge: Upinder S. Kalra

**Parties**

* Plaintiff: Helene G. Sakellis
* Defendant: Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, et al.

**Facts**

* Plaintiff worked at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center from July 1992 to June 2016
* Plaintiff alleges various claims against Defendants for retaliation, discrimination, and defamation
* Plaintiff filed a Complaint in March 2017
* Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment in April 2019, which was granted
* Plaintiff appealed and the Court of Appeal reversed the grant of summary judgment
* Plaintiff filed a motion for terminating sanctions in December 2023

**Legal Standard**

* A request for a sanction shall identify every person, party, and attorney against whom the sanction is sought, and specify the type of sanction sought
* The court may impose monetary, issue, evidence, and/or terminating sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process

**Analysis**

* Plaintiff contends that Defendant willfully destroyed nursing assignment sheets, meal/rest break schedules, and admission and discharge reports
* Defendant argues that the requested documents have little bearing on Plaintiff's remaining claims and that some of the requested documents never existed
* The court finds that Plaintiff did not establish Defendant destroyed or failed to preserve evidence with the culpable state of mind
* The court also finds that the records at issue are not essential to Plaintiff's claim and that Plaintiff has not shown a substantial probability of damage

**Conclusion**

* The court DENIES Plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions or alternatively evidentiary sanctions
* The court concludes that Plaintiff has utterly failed to present evidence showing that Defendant was aware of the significance of the documents years before their request in 2023, let alone that Defendant intentionally, negligently or knowingly failed to preserve the records

**Summary**

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions or alternatively evidentiary sanctions. The court finds that the Plaintiff did not establish that the Defendant willfully destroyed or failed to preserve evidence and that the records at issue are not essential to the Plaintiff's claim. The court also finds that the Plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to meet their initial burden.
