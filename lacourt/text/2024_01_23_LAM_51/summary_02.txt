And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the case and has made some key observations. First, the plaintiff did not request monetary sanctions in the notice of motion or in the body of the points and authorities, but only in her supporting declaration. Therefore, the court declines to address the request.

The court has also reviewed the records provided by the defendant, which are supposed to show the frequency in which nurses received patients and include lunch schedules. However, the court notes that the records custodian's testimony that he knew what to look for and that the records "should have existed" does not establish that the records actually existed.

The court also observes that the evidence suggests that it is questionable whether the plaintiff or the defense even considered the nursing assignment sheets and meal/rest break schedules significant until well after the remittitur issued.

Finally, the court notes that while the plaintiff has requested discovery sanctions, the evidence does not support an inference that the defendant intentionally destroyed the documents. The court declines to further develop the failure to preserve argument, which is premised on the claim that the documents existed.
