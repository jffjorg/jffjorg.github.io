English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Altimeter Growth Corporation's motion to quash service of summons, finding that the court lacks jurisdiction over the defendant. Altimeter Growth Corporation ceased to exist as a separate corporate entity following a business combination and merger in November 2021. The Judge notes that the plaintiff, Global Pond USA Corporation, has not met its burden to show that the court has jurisdiction over Altimeter Growth Corporation. The Judge relies on various authorities, including Omega Video Inc. v. Superior Court and Barajas v. Sativa LA County Water Dist., to support its finding that a non-existent entity may not be sued. The Judge orders the service of summons and complaint to be quashed and directs Altimeter Growth Corporation to prepare, serve, and lodge a proposed judgment of dismissal within 10 days.
