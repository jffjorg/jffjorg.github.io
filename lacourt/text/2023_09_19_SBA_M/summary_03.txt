The plaintiff argued that the defendant's answer should be stricken because it was filed by a natural person (Allen Russel) who is not an attorney and does not have the authority to represent the limited liability company. 


The judge agreed with the plaintiff and granted the motion.  The defendant will have to file a new answer to the complaint.
