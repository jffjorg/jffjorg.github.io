And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has granted the Petitioner's Motion for an Order Compelling Arbitration. The Petitioner, Nick Marier, entered into a Residential Income Property Purchase Agreement and Joint Instructions (RPA) with the Respondents, Belen Katzen, Barry Katzen, and DOES 1 through 20, on April 13, 2022. The RPA requires any disputes to be brought to arbitration. The Respondents refused to arbitrate, and the Petitioner filed a petition to compel arbitration. The Petitioner attached a copy of the RPA to the petition, which recites the provisions of the arbitration agreement verbatim. The Respondents did not file an opposition to the petition, so it was unopposed.

The Judge analyzed the case and found that the Petitioner has established the existence of a written arbitration agreement between the parties and that the Respondents refused to arbitrate. The Respondents' attempt to cancel the RPA is sufficient evidence of their refusal to arbitrate. The Judge granted the Petitioner's motion, ordering that the Respondents be compelled to arbitrate the controversy.
