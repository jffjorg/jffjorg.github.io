And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has granted the Petitioner's Motion for an Order Compelling Arbitration. The Petitioner, Nick Marier, entered into a Residential Income Property Purchase Agreement and Joint Instructions (RPA) with the Respondents, Belen Katzen, Barry Katzen, and DOES 1 through 20, on April 13, 2022. The RPA requires any disputes to be brought to arbitration. The Respondents refused to arbitrate, and the Petitioner filed a petition to compel arbitration. The Petitioner attached a copy of the RPA to the petition, which recites the provisions of the arbitration agreement verbatim. The Respondents did not file an opposition to the petition, so it was unopposed.

The Judge analyzed the case and found that the Petitioner has established the existence of a written arbitration agreement between the parties and that the Respondents refused to arbitrate. The Respondents' attempt to cancel the RPA is sufficient evidence of their refusal to arbitrate. The Judge granted the Petitioner's motion, ordering that the Respondents be compelled to arbitrate the controversy.

## English Summary:

This tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff, Nick Marier's, motion to compel arbitration. 

The background of the case is that Marier and the Defendants (Belen and Barry Katzen) entered into a Residential Income Property Purchase Agreement (RPA) on April 13, 2022, which included an arbitration clause.  Marier filed a petition to compel arbitration because the Defendants attempted to cancel the RPA based on allegations of "fraudulent proof of funds" and the Petitioner exercising his right to purchase the property at a lower price. 

The judge finds that the Defendants' actions constitute a refusal to arbitrate, as they attempted to cancel the agreement which clearly stipulated arbitration as the method for resolving disputes.  


Therefore, the court rules that the parties must proceed with arbitration as per the terms of their RPA.

The court has granted the motion filed by Nick Marier, the plaintiff, to compel arbitration in the dispute with Belen Katzen, Barry Katzen, and DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, the respondents.

The plaintiff alleges that the respondents have refused to arbitrate the dispute, and the court agrees that this is sufficient to establish the respondents' refusal to arbitrate.
