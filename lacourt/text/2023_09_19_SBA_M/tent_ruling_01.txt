LEGAL AUTHORITY
“As a general rule, all
property of a judgment debtor is subject to enforcement of a money judgment.
The California Constitution, however, requires the Legislature to protect ‘a
certain portion’ of a debtor’s property from forced sale. (Cal. Const., art.
XX, § 1.5.) The purpose of this requirement is to protect enough of the
debtors’ property from enforcement to enable them to support themselves and
their families, and to help shift the cost of social welfare for debtors from
the community to judgment creditors. [¶] To that end, California has enacted a
‘comprehensive and precisely detailed scheme’ governing enforcement of money
judgments. The kinds and degrees of property exempt from levy are described in
[Code of Civil Procedure] sections 704.010 through 704.210. These provisions
relate to property of the debtor that would ordinarily be subject to
enforcement of a money judgment by execution or otherwise, but for the statute
allowing the debtor to retain all or part of it to protect himself and his family.
These exemptions are wholly statutory and cannot be enlarged by the courts. And
although the burden of proof lies with the party claiming the exemption,
exemption statutes are generally construed in favor of the debtor.”  Kilker
v. Stillman (2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 320, 329–330. 
CCP § 704.225 provides
“Money in a judgment debtor’s deposit account that is not otherwise exempt
under this chapter is exempt to the extent necessary for the support of the
judgment debtor and the spouse and dependents of the judgment debtor.”   
CCP § 704.220(a) provides
“Money in the judgment debtor’s deposit account in an amount equal to or less
than the minimum basic standard of adequate care for a family of four for
Region 1, established by Section 11452 of the Welfare and Institutions Code and
as annually adjusted by the State Department of Social Services pursuant to
Section 11453 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, is exempt without making a
claim.”  CCP § 704.220(a).  The minimum exemption is currently at $2,080.00. 
Form EJ-156. 
DISCUSSION
Judgment creditor opposes
judgment debtor’s claim of exemption. 
Here, the total amount due
to judgment creditor is approximately $160,657.36 with accruing daily
interest.  Writ of Execution at § 18.  According to the Financial
Statement filed with the Claim of Exemption, Judgment debtor has $350.00 in a Bank
of America bank account, $1,300.00 in a Chase bank account, and $700.00 in cash. 
Financial Statement at § 3.  Judgment debtor has a monthly income of $2,700.00.
Financial Statement at § 2. Judgment debtor’s spouse has a monthly income of $5,500.00.
Financial Statement at § 1.  Judgment debtor’s monthly expenses is $8,700.00. 
Judgment debtor claims $700.00 in transportation and auto expenses and $500.00
in installment payments, but does in item 5, lists only $500.00 in car
payments. Financial Statement at § 4. Judgment debtor also lists student
loans but does not identify the amount. Financial Statement at § 5. Under
CCP § 704.220, $2,080.00 is automatically exempt.  CCP § 704.220(a); Form
EJ-156.  
The court requests
clarification on the transportation and auto expenses and the installment
payments. The court also requests further information about judgment debtor’s
student loans, including how much judgment debtor pays each month. 
Accordingly, the hearing is
continued.
