The court is considering the claim of exemption filed by the judgment debtor, Gizmo Media, LLC, and Nayeem Ahmed Khan. The judgment creditor, Amelia Yuhas, opposes the claim. The court has reviewed the papers filed by both parties and has found that the judgment debtor has $350.00 in a bank account, $1,300.00 in a Chase bank account, and $700.00 in cash. The judgment debtor also has a monthly income of $2,700.00 and expenses of $8,700.00.

The court is requesting clarification on the judgment debtor's transportation and auto expenses and installment payments. The court is also requesting further information on the judgment debtor's student loans. Under California law, a certain amount of money in a judgment debtor's deposit account is automatically exempt from enforcement of a money judgment. The court will continue the hearing to give the parties an opportunity to provide the requested information.
