RULING
            The court grants the motion. 
BACKGROUND
On April 3, 2023, plaintiff Brian
Whitaker sued defendant Soo Good Snack Bar LLC, a California Limited Liability
Company, for violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act and California Disabled
Persons Act. 
On July 5, 2023, defendant
answered. 
On August 22, 2023, plaintiff moved to strike
defendant’s answer. 
LEGAL AUTHORITY
The court may, upon a motion made
pursuant to Section 435, upon terms it deems proper, strike out all or any
part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws
of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court. CCP § 436(b).
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff moves to strike defendant’s
answer. 
Preliminarily, plaintiff
satisfied the meet and confer requirements. CCP § 435.5(a).  As plaintiff’s counsel attests, she tried to
set up a telephonic meet and confer with defendant’s owner, Allen Russel. (Decl.
Butler ¶¶ 6 – 9.) Russel did not respond. (Decl. Butler ¶ 10.)
Plaintiff moves to
strike on the grounds that a natural person cannot represent a corporation. A
corporation cannot appear in court by an officer who is not an attorney, and it
cannot appear in propria persona. Paradise v. Nowlin (1948) 86 Cal. App. 2d
897, 898. However, defendant is not a corporation, but a limited liability
company. The same reasoning might apply equally to a limited liability company,
which, like a corporation, is legal entity separate and apart from its members.
 Lippenberger v. Canal Props.
(2009) 2009 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 8367, *6 (citing Corp. Code, §§ 17003,
17101;  PacLink Communications
Internat., Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 958, 963; Grosset v.
Wenaas (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1100, 1108.
Accordingly, the motion is
GRANTED.
