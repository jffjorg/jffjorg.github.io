And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the plaintiff's motion to add judgment debtors who are alleged to be alter egos of the defendant, Sam Vaziri Vance, Inc. The motion is denied without prejudice as to Futurebound Capital LLC, and is taken off calendar as to the other remaining proposed judgment debtors. The court finds that there is insufficient evidence to support the addition of Wholesale Operations, LLC, BH Design Lab LLC, and David Wiggins as alter egos of the defendant. The court notes that the parties to be added are not named defendants in this action and have never been personally served. The court holds that proper service should have been completed in the same manner as required for service of summons generally. The court also notes that the obligation to serve a party with process is not coextensive with merely providing the party with notice of the proceeding.
