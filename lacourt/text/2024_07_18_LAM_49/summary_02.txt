And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling grants K. Kevin Levian's motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Rufino Garcia. The motion was filed because Levian has lost contact with Garcia and there have been issues with attorney-client communication. The court finds that there is no opposition to the motion and no evidence of undue prejudice to Garcia if Levian is relieved as counsel. The judge orders Levian to give notice to Garcia and informs Garcia that if he fails to appear at the upcoming hearing date of August 26, 2024, his case will be dismissed without prejudice.
