And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Nargis Rashid's motion for leave to amend her first amended complaint. The motion was filed on August 11, 2023, seeking to amend the complaint to include the names of all defendants and to have the second amended complaint deemed filed and served on August 11, 2023. The Court found that Plaintiff failed to comply with the procedural requirements for amending a pleading, specifically failing to provide a clear proposal for amendments to the complaint and a clear declaration supporting the motion. The Court also denied Plaintiff's request for retroactive leave to amend the complaint, citing the lack of legal authority supporting such request. The ruling is without prejudice, and Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
