TENTATIVE RULING RE:  
MOTION TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL



 
Aaron Fairchild of Fairchild
APC (“Counsel”) moves to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Nicholas F.
Devane.  
The Court
notes that while Counsel has provided sufficient reason for withdrawal, the
proof of service filed with the motion indicates that only Counsel’s client was
served with the motion. Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subdivision (d), “[t]he notice of motion and motion, the
declaration, and the proposed order must be served on the client and on all
other parties who have appeared in the case. The notice may be by personal
service, electronic service, or mail.” 
In
addition, Items 7 and 8 of the proposed order are blank. The Court notes that “[t]he proposed order relieving counsel…must specify
all hearing dates scheduled in the action or proceeding, including the date of
trial, if known.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subd. (e).) 
///
///
Based on the foregoing, the Court denies the motion without prejudice.
Counsel is ordered to give notice of this order.
