And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling by Judge Rolf M. Treu denies a motion by Aaron Fairchild, counsel for Defendant Nicholas F. Devane, to be relieved as counsel. The court notes that while Fairchild has provided sufficient reason for withdrawal, the notice of motion was not served on all parties, including the client and other defendants. Additionally, the proposed order is incomplete, lacking specific dates and details. As a result, the court denies the motion without prejudice, ordering Fairchild to give notice of this order.
