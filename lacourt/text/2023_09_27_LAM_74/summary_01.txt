And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion to compel arbitration filed by Greystar Management Services, LP (Defendant) and the opposition and reply papers filed by the plaintiffs, Robert Cole and Chaya Huston (Plaintiffs). The dispute revolves around the enforceability of the arbitration agreement's Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) waiver. The court holds that the waiver is enforceable and orders the Plaintiffs' individual PAGA claims to arbitration. However, the court stays the non-individual PAGA claims pending the arbitrator's ruling on the individual claims. The court also denies Defendant's request to dismiss the non-individual PAGA claims for lack of standing, citing Adolph v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (2023) 14 Cal.5th 1104.
