## English Text Summary:

In this case, Plaintiffs Robert Cole and Chaya Huston are suing Greystar Management for alleged Labor Code violations.  Greystar has filed a motion to compel arbitration based on an agreement with the Plaintiffs. The core dispute revolves around the enforceability of the PAGA waiver within this agreement.

The Judge acknowledges that the Supreme Court has ruled that private arbitration agreements cannot completely bar PAGA claims, but individual PAGA claims can be arbitrated. The Judge also cites a recent California Supreme Court ruling stating that a plaintiff can still pursue non-individual PAGA claims in court even if their individual claims are sent to arbitration.

Therefore, the Judge grants Greystar's motion to compel arbitration for the Plaintiffs' individual PAGA claims but denies their request to dismiss the non-individual claims. Instead, the Judge stays the non-individual claims until the arbitrator rules on the individual claims.
