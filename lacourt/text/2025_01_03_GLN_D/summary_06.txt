And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the Complaint filed by the plaintiff, Terri Milner, against the Los Angeles Unified School District. The Complaint alleges that the defendants were responsible for a hostile work environment and retaliation against the plaintiff's daughter, Taya Jones, and that the plaintiff suffered damages as a result. However, the judge has sustained the demurrer to the Complaint with leave to amend, citing several reasons. Firstly, the complaint is unclear as to how the plaintiff suffers personal damages, as the alleged physical pain and abuse were suffered by Taya Jones, a minor. Secondly, the plaintiff has not alleged any statutory basis for negligence liability against the public entity. Finally, the pleading seeks punitive damages against the LAUSD, which the court grants to strike under Government Code section 818.

The judge has given the plaintiff ten days to amend the Complaint, and has ordered the parties to meet and confer in full compliance with CCP ยง 430.41 before any further demurrer may be filed. The court has also granted the motion to strike the allegations of punitive damages.
