And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Defendant's motion to quash service of the summons and complaint. The Defendant, Chung Koo Kim, argued that the service was improper because it was made at the home of his daughter, Jennifer Kim, who is not involved in the case. The Judge found that the proof of service complied with the relevant statutes and that the service was properly made at the address designated by the Defendant in the lease agreement and on multiple notices. The Judge also noted that the Defendant's daughter's declaration was questionable in its credibility and that the Defendant failed to submit a declaration attesting to his own residency and business address. The Judge concluded that the service was proper and denied the motion to quash.
