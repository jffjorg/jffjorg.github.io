On February 7, 2023, a jury entered verdicts in favor of Plaintiffs DONE! Ventures, LLC (“Done!”) and Coastal Laundromat, Inc. (“Coastal”), and against Defendants Jerry Jamgotchian, El Segundo Plaza Associates L.P. (“ESPA”), and Theta Holding IV, Inc. (“Theta”) for Plaintiffs’ claims for interference with contract, negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, and breach of contract.On May 8, 2023, the Court entered a “judgment” on the verdict.  On July 12, 2023, the Court ruled on a motion for new trial/JNOV, stating that the amount of punitive damages awarded by the jury was improper and that Coastal was either to stipulate to $525,000 or else the Court would grant a new trial only as to the amount of punitive damages.  Coastal stipulated to taking less punitive damages.On September 5, 2023, the Court ruled on Coastal’s motion for attorneys’ fees and prejudgment interest.  Prejudgment interest was rejected, but the Court awarded $357,673 in fees.On February 6, 2024, the Court entered a final ruling denying Defendants’ motion to tax costs with respect to Done!.  That ruling also rejected prejudgment interest for Done!.  On February 27, 2024, the Court entered an “amended judgment”, which reduced the amount of punitive damages to be obtained by Done! and indicated the amount of fees, costs, and prejudgment interest to be awarded as discussed above.  On March 27, 2024, the Court denied Defendants’ request to amend the February 27, 2024, judgment as follows: “(1) amend title of the Court’s February 27, 2024, judgment to read ‘Final Judgment’ and not its current incorrect and misleading title, ‘Amended Judgment,’ (2) Amend the date of the Court’s award of post-judgment interest from May 8, 2023 (date of the Court’s interim, non-final jury verdict judgment) to the date of final judgment, or February 27, 2024 (the date the Court signed final judgment in this case, erroneously entitled ‘Amended Judgment,’ as above), as the May 8, 2023 interim judgment is void and no longer has any force and effect by operation of law.”  The Court also denied Defendants’ request to quash  “all outstanding levies issued under the Court’s interim - and now void and unenforceable - May 8, 2023 jury verdict judgment.”   Coastal now seeks “an order awarding it attorneys' fees incurred for the period between July 25, 2023 and March 31, 2024 in dealing with post-judgment matters and enforcement of the judgment. The total amount sought by this motion is $122,488, and the fees are sought jointly and severally against judgment debtors Theta Holding IV, Inc. and El Segundo Plaza Associates, L.P. and in favor of Coastal Laundromat, Inc.” As mentioned, on September 5, 2023, the Court awarded attorneys’ fees to Coastal as a prevailing party and stated, “the lease with ESPA allows for contractual fees, and the purchase agreement with Theta also allows for tort fees.  Therefore, fees can be awarded against both ESPA and Theta.”  This finding applies equally here, and fees are further permissible under Code Civ. Proc. § 685.040. The subject fee request is as follows: Hill Farrer & Burrill: 42.4 hours by Mr. Hix at $565.00 per hour ($23,956) and 1.4 hours by Michael Collins at $600 per hour ($840) for a total of $24,796.00; Kyle P. Kelley: 97.2 hours at $635.00 per hour for a total of $61,722; andGretchen Lichtenberger: 101.8 hours at $350.00 per hour for a total of $35,630.00 in fees. Kelley is a collections attorney that has successfully pursued two cases against Jamgotchian in the past.  Kelley is a member of the California State Bar and often litigates in California, despite living in Texas.  Lichtenberger is a paralegal that often works with Kelley.  Kelley and Lichtenberger provide a succinct and reasonable explanation as to how fees were allocated between Coastal and Done! within their declarations. Defendants present an endless bevy of arguments against the subject fee request that can be summarized in the “Conclusion” section of their briefing. The Court has considered these arguments and finds that they mostly lack merit as being unsubstantiated, speculative, or plain false.  The only adjustment the Court will make is to reduce the hourly rate of Kelley from $635 to $500 and the rate of Lichtenberger from $350 to $250.  In sum, the Motion for Attorneys’ Fees is granted in part.  A proposed order is to be submitted accordingly. The Requests for Judicial Notice are granted.  The objections are overruled.Coastal to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
