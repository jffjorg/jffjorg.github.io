Significant Statements:
  - The court must afford a strong presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings, and the party challenging the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing the court that the administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the evidence.
  - The propriety of a penalty imposed by an administrative agency is a matter vested in the discretion of the agency, and its decision may not be disturbed unless there has been a manifest abuse of discretion.
  - The court exercises its independent judgment on the administrative findings, and may draw its own reasonable inferences from the evidence and make its own determinations as to the credibility of witnesses.
  - The court may not substitute its own discretion as to the matter, nor may the court interfere with the imposition of a penalty by an administrative tribunal unless there is an arbitrary, capricious or patently abusive exercise of discretion.
