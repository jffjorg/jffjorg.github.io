And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the petition for writ of mandate filed by Oscar Rojas, a police officer who was terminated from his employment with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). The petition challenged the finding of guilt on Count One, which alleged that Rojas made an inappropriate ethnic remark via text message to his then-girlfriend, and the penalty of termination.

The judge found that the Board of Rights had sufficient evidence to support the finding of guilt on Count One, including testimony from Rojas that he learned the term "porch monkey" from a movie, but the Board did not believe his testimony. The judge also found that the LAPD did not need to show racial animus to impose discipline on Rojas for using a racist term.

The judge further found that the penalty of termination was not a manifest abuse of discretion, considering the totality of the circumstances, including Rojas' prior disciplinary record and the lack of judgment shown in the prior Board of Rights. The judge concluded that the penalty was reasonable and did not exceed the Board's authority.

Overall, the judge's decision upholds the discipline imposed on Rojas and affirmatively terminates his employment with the LAPD.
