```

And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion to continue trial filed by Defendant Kylie Zhou. The motion is denied. Zhou seeks a continuance based on the need to complete discovery. However, the court finds that Zhou has not established good cause for a continuance. Zhou appeared in the case in December 2023, and although Zhou now asserts that much discovery remains to be done, there is no showing of diligence by Zhou (or the other parties) over the past nine months. The voluntary substitution of counsel by Zhou in June 2024 is not good cause for a trial continuance. The court notes that trial is set for December 9, and the deadline for fact discovery has not yet expired. The potential that Zhou might at some point in the future seek to file a motion for summary judgment is not, without more, good cause for a continuance of trial.
