Significant Statements:
  - "Defendants were forced to file the motions to compel by November 24, 2023, given Plaintiff's refusal to extend the 45-day deadline, which was unreasonable given the parties' extensive attempts to resolve their issues."
  - "The consequence of these failures to meet and confer in good faith with respect to motion deadlines or to communicate as to whether or not Plaintiff would voluntarily supplement without motion was to cause undue burden and costs for Defendants and the Court; additionally, the motions do not address the supplemental responses since Defendants were unaware they would be forthcoming."
```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants in part and denies in part the amended motion by defendant Wily Oris Barrios and the two amended motions by defendant W.B.& E. Properties to compel plaintiff Evelin Quintero's further responses to interrogatories and requests for imposition of monetary sanctions. The ruling finds that plaintiff's responses to interrogatories were evasive and incomplete, and that defendants were reasonable in filing motions to compel further responses. However, the ruling also finds that plaintiff's abuse of the discovery process warrants imposition of monetary sanctions of $3,930. The ruling grants plaintiff's amended responses, but denies the motions to compel further responses.
