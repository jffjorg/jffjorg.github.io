And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Quinn/Saunders' demand for a jury trial in this case. Quinn/Saunders own real properties that abut the properties of the Lorenzos, who purchased their property from Bay Harbor. Quinn/Saunders sued the Lorenzos and Bay Harbor, alleging private nuisance and negligence claims based on a faulty retaining wall on the Lorenzos' property that allegedly caused cracking in their properties.

The case went to trial, but Quinn/Saunders did not pay the required jury fees, and the trial was conducted as a bench trial. The court issued a statement of decision in favor of the Lorenzos and Bay Harbor, and Quinn/Saunders appealed. The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment in part and reversed it in part, directing the court to determine whether Quinn/Saunders have proven the elements necessary to recover under their private nuisance and negligence theories.

Quinn/Saunders demanded a jury trial on remand, but the Lorenzos moved to strike that demand, arguing that Quinn/Saunders waived their right to a jury trial at the initial trial. The court agrees with the Lorenzos and finds that Quinn/Saunders waived their right to a jury trial at the first trial under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 631. The court also finds that the retrial ordered by the Court of Appeal was not for a trial de novo, but rather for a retrial on issues of causation, and therefore, Quinn/Saunders' waiver of their right to a jury trial at the first trial is binding on the subsequent proceedings. The retrial will proceed as a bench trial.
