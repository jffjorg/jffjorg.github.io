And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants, Galen Elizabeth Berger and Douglas O. Berger, have successfully moved to quash service of the summons and complaint. The defendants were served by substitute service on July 22, 2023, but they have provided evidence that neither of them resided at the service address at the time of service. The judge finds that the plaintiff, Susan Ellen Rosen, has not met her burden in demonstrating that the defendants were properly served with the summons and complaint. As a result, the judge has granted the defendants' motions to quash service and has set a status conference to discuss service of the summons and complaint on the defendants.
