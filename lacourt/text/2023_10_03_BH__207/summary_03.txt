## English Summary:

This tentative ruling concerns a case where Susan Ellen Rosen (Plaintiff) sued Galen Elizabeth Berger and Douglas O. Berger (Defendants) for damages related to an alleged incident in March 2023.  

The Plaintiff attempted to serve the Defendants by substitute service at an address in Los Angeles, California. However, the Defendants disputed this address, claiming they no longer resided there. They provided declarations stating their current residences are in New York and South Carolina respectively. 

The Plaintiff presented a police report that listed the disputed Los Angeles address for the Defendants, but the Judge found this insufficient to overcome the Defendants' evidence. 

As a result, the Judge grants the Defendants' motions to quash service of the summons and complaint, meaning the service was deemed improper. A status conference is scheduled for November 16, 2023, to discuss proper service of the legal documents.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to quash service of summons and complaint filed by defendants Galen Elizabeth Berger and Douglas O. Berger. The court finds that defendants have rebutted the presumption of proper service of the summons and complaint, and that plaintiff Susan Ellen Rosen has not met her burden in demonstrating that defendants were properly served with the summons and complaint by substituted service. The court grants defendants' motions to quash service of summons and complaint and sets a status conference on November 16, 2023, to discuss further service of the summons and complaint on defendants. The court's ruling is based on the evidence presented, including declarations from defendants stating that they do not reside at the address where they were served, and the lack of evidence refuting this claim. The court also relies on relevant case law and statutes, including Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10 and § 415.10, to support its decision.
