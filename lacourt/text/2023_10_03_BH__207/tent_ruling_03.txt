MOTIONS
 
            Defendants Galen Elizabeth Berger (“Galen”)
and Douglas O. Berger (“Douglas”) (collectively, “Defendants”) appear specially
and move to quash service of the summons and complaint.  Defendants have each filed nearly identical
motions to quash.  Plaintiff Susan Ellen
Rosen (“Plaintiff”) has filed identical oppositions to each motion.  Defendants have not filed replies.
 
LEGAL
STANDARDS
 
“A defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or
within any further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and
file a notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes: (1) To quash
service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him
or her. (2) To stay or dismiss the action on the ground of inconvenient
forum.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10,
subd. (a)(1)-(2).)  
 
“In the absence of a voluntary submission to the authority of the
court, compliance with the statutes governing service of process is essential
to establish that court's personal jurisdiction over a defendant. When a
defendant challenges that jurisdiction by bringing a motion to quash, the
burden is on the plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving,
inter alia, the facts requisite to an effective service.” (Dill v. Berquist
Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1439–1440; accord Lebel v.
Mai (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1154, 1160 [“It was incumbent upon plaintiff,
after the filing of defendant's motion to quash, to present evidence
discharging her burden to establish the requisites of valid service on
defendant”]; Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413
[“when a defendant challenges the court's personal jurisdiction on the ground
of improper service of process “the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the
existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an
effective service” ”].)  A declaration of
service by a registered process server establishes a presumption that the facts
stated in the declaration are true. (Evid. Code, § 647; Rodriguez v. Cho
(2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 742, 750.) 
 
“In order to obtain in personam jurisdiction through any form of
constructive service there must be strict compliance with the requisite
statutory procedures.” (Zirbes v. Stratton (1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1407,
1417, quoting Stamps v. Superior Court (1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 108,
110.)   
 
First, “[a] summons may be served by
personal delivery of a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the person
to be served.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §
415.10.)  Alternatively, a
plaintiff may serve an individual defendant “by leaving a copy of the summons
and complaint at the person's dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place
of business, or usual mailing address . . . , in the presence of a competent
member of the household or a person apparently in charge of his or her office,
place of business, or usual mailing address . . . , at least 18 years of age,
who shall be informed of the contents thereof, and by thereafter mailing a copy
of the summons and of the complaint by first-class mail, postage prepaid to the
person to be served at the place where a copy of the summons and complaint were
left.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20, subd. (b).) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            This case arises from an alleged
incident on March 15, 2023 in Beverly Hills, where Galen allegedly struck
Plaintiff with the vehicle she was driving, which Douglas owns.  Plaintiffs Susan Ellen Rosen and Stuart Rosen
filed the complaint in this matter on July 17, 2023.  
 
            The proofs of service filed with the
Court on August 7, 2023, indicate each Defendant was served by substitute
service on July 22, 2023 by leaving copies of the summons and complaint with
Kirsten Perkins, the occupant at 6336 W. 82nd St. in Los Angeles, California 90045-2838,
and subsequently mailing copies of the summons and complaint to Defendants at
the same address.  The Declarations of
Diligence indicate that the process server attempted to personally serve each
Defendant at that address on July 20, 2023 at 11:15 a.m.; on July 21 at 3:30
p.m., and July 22, 2023 at 10:45 a.m. 
There was apparently no answer on the first two attempts, and on the
third attempt, the notation provides “Subject not home per occupant.”    
 
Notwithstanding, Defendants have produced declarations indicating that
the address listed on the proofs of service is not the current residence for
either Defendant.  Specifically,
paragraph five of Galen’s Declaration provides, “I have been living in New York
since June 1, 2023.”  Paragraph five of
Douglas’s Declaration indicates, “I have never lived at 6336 W. 82nd Street,
Los Angeles, CA 90045.”  Galen’s
Declaration indicates it was signed in New York, and Douglas’s Declaration
indicates it was signed in South Carolina.
 
In opposition, Plaintiff produces a copy of the police report for the
incident, which indicates the officer identified Galen by her “valid South
Carolina Driver License” and lists her address as 6336 W. 82nd St., Los
Angeles, CA 90045.  The police report
provides a different address in South Carolina for Douglas.
 
Defendants have provided sufficient evidence that neither of them
resided at the service address when substitute service was supposedly
effectuated.  Nothing in the record refutes
this.  The evidence demonstrates that,
while Galen may have a previous association with the service address, she has
lived in New York since June 1, 2023. 
Thus, when the process server left the summons and complaint with “Kirsten
Perkins-Occupant” of the 82nd St. address on July 22, 2023, it was no longer
Galen’s residence.  Moreover, there is no
evidence in the record to suggest that Douglas ever lived at that address, and
Douglas has affirmatively asserted in his declaration that he has not.
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
            Based upon the record, the Court
finds that Defendants have rebutted the presumption of proper service of the
summons and complaint, and in turn, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not met her
burden in demonstrating that Defendants were properly served with the summons
and complaint by substituted service.
 
Accordingly, the Court grants Defendants’ motions to quash service of
summons and complaint.  Further, the
Court sets a Status Conference re service of the summons and complaint on
Defendants on November 16, 2023 at 8:30 A.M. in Department 207.  
 
The Clerk of the Court shall provide notice of the Court’s
ruling.
