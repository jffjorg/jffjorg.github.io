And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a demurrer filed by Cross-Defendants to the Cross-Complaint brought by Cross-Complainants. Cross-Defendants had argued that the Cross-Complaint failed to state a cause of action for intentional interference with economic advantage and unfair business practices. However, the judge found that the Cross-Complaint had sufficiently pled the ultimate facts necessary to state these causes of action. The judge overruled the demurrer and ordered Cross-Defendants to answer the Cross-Complaint on or before October 17, 2023. The judge also noted that the discovery process can clarify any ambiguities in the pleadings.
