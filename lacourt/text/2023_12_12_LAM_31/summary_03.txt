And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the motion to quash a deposition subpoena issued by the plaintiff against Glen Oaks Escrow, Inc. The subpoena seeks production of business records related to the purchase and sale of several properties. The defendants argue that the subpoena should be quashed because the plaintiff failed to serve notice to consumer on the buyers and sellers of the properties, and that the subpoena seeks irrelevant information and information that is protected by privacy rights.

The judge agrees that the subpoena should be quashed for failure to provide consumer notice, but notes that the parties will need to meet and confer on the scope and categories of information and the appropriate use of a protective order and/or redactions.

The judge also declines to impose sanctions on any party, finding that this was a close matter involving sensitive financial information of nonparties.

In summary, the motion to quash the deposition subpoena is granted, and the parties will need to meet and confer on the scope and categories of information and the appropriate use of a protective order and/or redactions. Sanctions are denied.
