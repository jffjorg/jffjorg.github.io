FOR DETERMINATION OF GOOD FAITH SETTLEMENT

I.          BACKGROUND
 
            This is a tenant-landlord dispute involving habitability conditions.
On July 15, 2020, Plaintiffs Romelia Leon de Garcia; Belisario Garcia; Jesus
Alexander Garcia by and through his guardian ad litem Romelia Leon De Garcia,
et al. filed a Complaint against Bruce A. Roden and Susan M. Roden, as
individuals and trustees of the Living Trust of Bruce A. Roden and Susan M.
Roden 1995 Dated July 20, 1995 (“Settling Defendants”), Gordon Cole, LLC, AQP
Management, Inc., and Joel Estrada. 
            
            On August 24,
2023, Gordon Cole, LLC, AQP Management, Inc., and Joel Estrada filed an
Application for Determination of Good Faith Settlement.  The Court granted the Application on
September 26, 2023
 
            On October
13, 2023, Settling Defendants filed a Notice of Settlement and this Application
for Determination of Good Faith Settlement with all plaintiffs. 
 
            The Application
is unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARDS
 
            “Any party to an action in which it is alleged that two
or more parties are joint tortfeasors or coobligors on a contract shall be
entitled to a hearing on the issue of the good faith settlement entered into by
the plaintiff or other claimant and one or more alleged tortfeasors or
coobligors ….”¿ (Code of Civ. Proc., § 877.6.)¿ Good faith settlements further
two sometimes competing policies: (1) the equitable sharing of costs among the
parties at fault, and (2) the encouragement of settlements.¿ (Erreca’s v.
Superior Court (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1475, 1487.)¿¿ 
 
            The Court must consider several factors including “a
rough approximation of plaintiffs’ total recovery and the settlor’s
proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of
settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and a recognition that a settlor should
pay less in settlement than he would if he were found liable after a trial.”¿ (Tech-Bilt,
Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, 499 (Tech-Bilt).)¿¿“Other
relevant considerations include the financial conditions and insurance policy
limits of settling defendants, as well as the existence of collusion, fraud, or
tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of nonsettling defendants.” ¿(Id.)¿¿¿ 
 
            The evaluation of whether a settlement was made in good
faith is¿ required to “be made on the basis of information available at the
time of settlement.”¿ (Tech-Bilt, supra, 38 Cal.3d at p.
499.) ¿“[A] court not only looks at the alleged tortfeasor’s potential
liability to the plaintiff, but it must also consider the culpability of the
tortfeasor vis-à-vis other parties alleged to be responsible for the same
injury.” ¿(TSI Seismic Tenant Space, Inc. v. Superior Court (2007) 149
Cal.App.4th 159, 166.)¿ “Potential liability for indemnity to a nonsettling
defendant is an important consideration for the trial court in determining
whether to approve a settlement by an alleged tortfeasor.”¿ (Id.)¿¿ 
 
            In City of Grand View Terrace v. Superior Court
(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1251, 1261, the court provided the following guidance
regarding a motion for a good faith settlement determination:¿¿ 
 
“If the good faith settlement is contested,
section 877.6, subdivision (d), sets forth a workable ground rule for the
hearing by placing the burden of proving the lack of good faith on the
contesting party. Once there is a showing made by the settlor of the
settlement, the burden of proof on the issue of good faith shifts to the
nonsettlor who asserts that the settlement was not made in good faith. If
contested, declarations by the nonsettlor should be filed which in many cases
could require the moving party to file responsive counterdeclarations to negate
the lack of good faith asserted by the nonsettling contesting party.” 
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            A.  Procedural Requirements  
 
            The
notice, application, and proposed order must be served by certified mail,
return receipt requested, or by personal service.  If the nonsettling
parties do not file a motion challenging the settlement within 25 days of
mailing of the notice, application, and proposed order, or within 20 days of
personal service, the court may approve the settlement.¿ (Code of Civ. Proc., §
877.6, subd. (a)(2).)¿¿ 
 
            Here,
Settling Defendants served this Application to all parties by certified mail on
October 13, 2023—more than 25 days before this hearing.  The Application
is uncontested.  Settling Defendant has
satisfied the procedural requirements. 
 
            B.  Good Faith Determination
 
            After participating in a global mediation and additional
negotiations, Plaintiffs and Settling Defendants reached a global settlement.  Under the terms of the agreement, Settling
Defendants agree to pay Plaintiffs the total sum of $621,875.000 in exchange
for full release of all claims.¿ 
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
            Based on
the foregoing, the Court concludes the settlement between Plaintiffs and Roden
Defendants was made in good faith.¿ The unopposed Application for Determination
of Good Faith Settlement is GRANTED.
 
Moving party to give notice.
