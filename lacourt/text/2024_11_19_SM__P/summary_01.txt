And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants defendants' motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against plaintiff Ammari. The motion was filed on an untimely basis, but the judge considers the opposition filed by plaintiff, which argued that the motion was untimely, prejudicial, and brought in bad faith. The judge finds that the cross-complaint arises from the same set of facts and circumstances as the first amended complaint, and is compulsory. The judge also finds that the motion will not cause significant prejudice to plaintiff and will not greatly expand the scope of discovery or length of trial. The judge reminds both parties that sanctions are a harsh remedy only to be imposed sparingly, and neither side has established a basis for sanctions. The defendants are ordered to file their cross-complaint within 5 court days.
