And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted defendant Knighton's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against plaintiff Bigfoot Ventures, LTD. The cross-complaint is related to a breach of contract arising from paragraph 9 of the parties' 2008 secured promissory note. The plaintiff had argued that the defendant's grounds for cross-complaining are time-barred and that the cross-complaint would be subject to a demurrer or an anti-SLAPP motion. However, the court has chosen not to exercise its discretion to deny leave to amend, and the defendant is granted permission to file its cross-complaint within 5 days.
