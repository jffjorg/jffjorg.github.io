Defendant Knighton’s Motion for
Leave to File Cross-Complaint
Motions
for leave to amend pleadings are liberally granted at all stages of the
proceedings, up to and including the eve of trial. CCP §§473(a)(1), 576. A
court may deny leave to amend if the potential defendant/cross-defendant will
suffer prejudice as a result of the amendment. Prejudice may be found where the
amendment would result in a delay of trial, along with loss of critical
evidence, added costs of preparation, increased burden of discovery, etc. Magpali
v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488.
Defendant
moves for leave to file cross-complaint for breach of contract arising from
paragraph 9 of the parties’ 2008 secured promissory note. Plaintiff argues
defendant’s grounds for cross-complaining are time-barred and defendant’s claim
for breach of contract would have accrued no later than 2020. Defendant asserts
plaintiff’s 4/6/23 complaint is the alleged breach, so his claims are not
time-barred. 
Plaintiff
argues defendant’s motion is subject to demur, so should be denied. This is
unavailing. Whether a cross-complaint will succeed is not the determining
factor in deciding whether leave to file will be granted. Plaintiff notes the
court is within its discretion to deny leave to amend on such grounds. See
Pollard v. Forest Lawn Memorial Park Ass’n. (1936) 15 Cal.App.2d 77, 82.
The court chooses not to exercise that discretion. Plaintiff may demurrer,
should it wish.
Plaintiff
next argues the cross-complaint would be subject to an anti-SLAPP motion, so should
be denied. Likewise, whether an anti-SLAPP motion might be filed or granted is
not a basis to deny a party’s ability to file a cross-complaint.
Trial
has not been set, and discovery is open. California has a strong policy of
permitting cross-complaints when there is no showing of prejudice. No prejudice
has been shown or alleged. Defendant’s motion is GRANTED. Defendant to file its
cross-complaint within 5 days.
