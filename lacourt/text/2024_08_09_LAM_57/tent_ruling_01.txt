  Case Number:  23STCV05240    Hearing Date:   August 9, 2024    Dept:  57 At today's hearing on the OSC re appointment of a partition referee, the Court will appoint Kevin Singer and John Rachlin.  To memorialize the appointment, the Court will direct Defendants' counsel Mr. Seeley to prepare the proposed order, using his redlined version of Mr. Singer's "termplate" order.  The Court will spend no time today reviewing with Mr. Seeley and Plaintiffs counsel Ms. Rosenthal why one joint status report was not submitted, and their tiresome and tedious sniping at each other in the non-joint reports that were filed.
