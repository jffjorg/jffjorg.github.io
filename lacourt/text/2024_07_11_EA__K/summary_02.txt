Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by AltaMed Health Services Corporation, the defendant in this case. AltaMed moved for judgment on the pleadings as to certain causes of action alleged by the plaintiff, Socorro Alegria, and moved to strike certain language from the complaint. The court grants AltaMed's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the fifth, sixth, and tenth causes of action, which alleged violations of Civil Code sections 51.7, 51.9, and the Tom Bane Civil Rights Act, respectively. The court denies AltaMed's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the eighth and ninth causes of action, which alleged negligent infliction of emotional distress and negligence, respectively. The court also denies AltaMed's motion to strike as moot, as the language sought to be stricken pertains to the causes of action that have been agreed to be dismissed by the plaintiff. A case management conference is set for July 11, 2024.
