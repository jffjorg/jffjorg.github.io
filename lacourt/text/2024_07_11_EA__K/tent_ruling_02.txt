1.         Judgment
on the Pleadings
Legal Standard
The rules
governing demurrers are generally applicable to a motion for judgment on the
pleadings. (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman
Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999; Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (d)
[“The grounds for motion. . . shall appear on the face of the challenged
pleading or from any matter of which the court is required to take judicial
notice. Where the motion is based on a matter of which the court may take
judicial notice. . ., the matter shall be specified in the notice of motion, or
in the supporting points and authorities, except as the court may otherwise
permit”].)
A motion by a
plaintiff may only be made on the grounds “that the complaint states facts
sufficient to constitute a cause or causes of action against the defendant and
the answer does not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense to the
complaint.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c)(1)(A).) A motion by a defendant
may only be made on the grounds that (1) “[t]he court has no jurisdiction of
the subject of the cause of action alleged in the complaint” or (2) “[t]he
complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action
against that defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c).)
Although a
nonstatutory motion “may be made at any time either prior to the trial or at
the trial itself” (Stoops v. Abbassi
(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 644, 650 [quotation marks and citation omitted]), a statutory
motion cannot be made after entry of a pretrial conference order or 30 days
before the initial trial date, whichever is later, unless the court otherwise
permits. (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (e).)
Discussion
AltaMed moves the court, pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure § 438, for judgment on the pleadings as to the fifth, sixth,
and eighth through tenth (i.e., for Violation of Civil Code § 51.7, Sexual
Harassment in Violation of Civil Code § 51.9, Negligent Infliction of Emotional
Distress, Negligence and Violation of the Tom Bane Civil Rights Act,
respectively) causes of action in
Plaintiff’s complaint, on the basis that they each fail to state facts
sufficient to constitute causes of action.
At the outset, Plaintiff
represents that she agrees to dismiss her fifth, sixth and tenth causes of
action, without prejudice (Opp., 1:26-2:2); accordingly, in the event a
“Request for Dismissal” is not on file by the time of the hearing, the court
will summarily grant the motion in this regard.
The court’s
following analysis, then, is limited to Plaintiff’s eighth and ninth causes of
action, for Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress and Negligence,
respectively:
AltaMed asserts
that these causes of action fail because it cannot be held vicariously liable
for an alleged sexual assault by its employee. “[A]n employer is vicariously
liable for the torts of its employees committed within the scope of the
employment.” (Lisa M. v. Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital (1995) 12
Cal.4th 291, 296.) However, “[a]n employer will not be held liable for an assault or other
intentional tort that did not have a causal nexus to the employee's work.” (Id.
at 297).
The court
construes Plaintiff’s eighth and ninth causes of action as sounding in direct
negligence, rather than vicarious liability. Further, while AltaMed contends
that these causes of action are “surplusage,” this argument was raised for the
first time in the reply; as such, it is disregarded. The motion is denied in
this regard.

2.         Motion to
Strike
AltaMed moves the court for an order striking out the
following language from Plaintiff’s complaint:
1.              
Page 12, paragraph 68, lines 6-12;
2.              
Page 13, paragraph 79, lines 9-15;
3.              
Page 16, paragraph 102, lines 18-24;
4.              
Page 17, paragraph 7, line 13;
5.              
Page 17, paragraph 9, line 15;
6.              
Page 17, paragraph 10, line 16.
AltaMed’s request is denied as moot. All of the allegations
AltaMed seeks to have stricken pertain to the fifth, sixth and tenth causes of
action, which Plaintiff has agreed to dismiss.
