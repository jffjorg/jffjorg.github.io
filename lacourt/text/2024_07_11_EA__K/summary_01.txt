And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion of Manking ELS LLC, Chung Chin Tsai, and Kenny Tsai (collectively, "Cross-Defendants") to set aside the default entered against them on the First Amended Cross-Complaint. The default was entered due to a clerical error by Cross-Defendants' counsel, who missed the deadline for response to the cross-complaint. The judge awards attorney's fees and costs in the reduced amount of $329.04, payable within 30 days from the date of the notice of ruling. The court finds that the default was caused by the attorney's mistake and not by excusable neglect.
