And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiffs, without prejudice. The motion was filed by Tom Feher, the attorney representing the plaintiffs, on May 14, 2024. However, the motion was not served on the defendants, as required by the California Rules of Court. The judge cites the California Code of Civil Procedure and the California Rules of Professional Conduct in support of the decision. The motion is denied without prejudice, meaning that counsel can refile the motion if the required service is completed.
