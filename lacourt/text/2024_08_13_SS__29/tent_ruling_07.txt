Background
On June 15, 2023, Waldemar Samayoa and Corene
Parsons (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Michael Jon
Riccelli and County of Los Angeles (collectively “Defendants”) for negligence
and violation of California Government Code section 815.2 and 820(a) causes of
action arising out of an automobile accident occurring on July 15, 2022 at the
intersection of Firestone Boulevard and Ivy Street  in Los Angeles County.
On August 2, 2023, Defendants filed their
answer.
On May 14, 2024, Tom
Feher of Feher Law, APC (“Counsel”) filed these motions to be relieved
as counsel for Plaintiffs. No opposition has been filed. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration, and Order to be relieved as counsel for
Plaintiffs. However, there is no proof of service filed to show the papers were
served on Defendants.
 
Accordingly, the
motion is DENIED without prejudice.
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is DENIED without prejudice.
