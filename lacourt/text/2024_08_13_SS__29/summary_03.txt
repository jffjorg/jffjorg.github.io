Significant Statements:
  - The purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties' pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.
  - A deemed admitted order establishes, by judicial fiat, that a nonresponding party has responded to the requests by admitting the truth of all matters contained therein.
  - If a party does not move the trial court to allow for withdrawal or amendment of an admission, the admission is conclusively established against that party in the action.
  - The basic elements of a cause of action for negligence are: (1) the existence of a legal duty; (2) breach of that duty; (3) causation; and (4) resulting damages.

Summary:
The judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The defendants sought to have the case dismissed based on the plaintiff's admissions, including admissions that the defendants were not negligent and that the plaintiff was not harmed or damaged as a result of the incident. However, the plaintiff was granted permission to withdraw the admissions, and without those admissions, the defendants have not met their burden of showing that one or more elements of the cause of action cannot be established. The case will proceed to trial.
