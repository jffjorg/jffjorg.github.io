Background
On May 1, 2023, Plaintiff Rony Issac Montes
(“Plaintiff”) filed his complaint against Christopher Tsunglung Ho
(“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 50 for Motor Vehicle Negligence and General
Negligence stemming from an auto accident occurring May 1, 2021.
Defendant filed his answer on October 19, 2023.
On March 12, 2024, the Court granted the motion
of Plaintiff’s counsel to be relieved as counsel.
On October 19, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff
with Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Requests for Production (Set One) through
Plaintiff’s then-counsel.  (Gardner Decls.,
¶ 3 & Exhs. B.)  Plaintiff did not respond.  (Id.,
¶¶ 4-8.)
On March 15, 2024, Defendant noticed Plaintiff’s
deposition for April 2, 2024.  (Gardner
Decl., ¶ 5 & Exh. D.)  Plaintiff did
not object and did not appear.  (Id., ¶¶
8-9.)  Defendant sent correspondence to
Plaintiff to inquire about the nonappearance, but Plaintiff did not
respond.  (Id., ¶¶ 9-10 & Exhs. F, H.)

 
 
 
 
 
On April 15 and 18, 2024, Defendant
filed these three motions.  The hearings
were initially set for July 5 and continued to August 13.
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
Deposition
“Any
party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any
person, including any party to the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the
requirements for (among other things) what must be included in a deposition
notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice
must be served.  
“The
service of a deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a
party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and
copying.”  (Id., § 2025.280, subd.
(a).)
Section
2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at
least three days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition
notice does not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through
2025.280.
Section
2025.450, subdivision (a), provides:
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization
that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  
Any
such motion to compel must show good cause for the production of documents and,
when a deponent has failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.”  (Id.,
subd. (b).) 
When
a motion to compel is granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery.”  Where a party or attorney
has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary
sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Id., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
Interrogatories
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
Requests for Production
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When
a party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
Discussion
Motion to Compel Deposition of
Plaintiff
Defendant
served Plaintiff by mail and electronic transmission with notice of a deposition
set for April 2, 2024. (Gardner Decl., ¶ 5 & Exh. D.) Plaintiff did not
serve objections and did not appear for deposition. (Id., ¶¶ 7-8.)
Defendant reached out to Plaintiff to inquire about the non-appearance;
Plaintiff did not respond. (Id., ¶¶ 9-10.)
 
Defendant
need not show anything more.  The motion
to compel is granted.
 
The
Court also grants in part Defendant’s request for sanctions under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (g)(1).  The Court sets sanctions in the amount of
$1,184.50, calculated based on 1.5 hours of attorney time at a
reasonable hourly rate of $235, plus $60 for filing fees, plus $772 for the
Court Reporter fees. (See Garnder Decl., ¶ 13; see also Exh I.)
 
Motions to Compel Responses to Interrogatories and Requests
for Production
 
Defendant served Plaintiff with Form Interrogatories and Requests
for Production in October 2023. (Gardner Decls., ¶ 3 & Exhs. B.)  Plaintiff did not respond.. (Id., ¶
5.)
 
Defendant need not show anything more.  The motions to compel Plaintiff to respond to
the Form Interrogatories and the Request for Production are granted. 
The requests for sanctions in connection with the
motions to compel responses to the interrogatories and requests for production are
denied.
In contrast to Code of Civil Procedure section
2025.450, subdivision (g)(1), the applicable provisions of the Civil Discovery Act
governing motions to compel initial responses to interrogatories and requests
for production authorize sanctions only “against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes” a motion to compel.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c) & 2031.300, subd. (c).)  Here, however, Plaintiff has not opposed the
motion.  Accordingly, no sanctions are
authorized.
