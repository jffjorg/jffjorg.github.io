 Case Number:  22STCV27541    Hearing Date:   August 13, 2024    Dept:  29 Hemsley v. LAUSD
22STCV27541
Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Defendants Inclusive Education and
Community Partnership, Inc and Wendy De La O.
 
 
Tentative Ruling
 
The motion for summary judgment is DENIED.
 
Background 
 
This
case arises out of an incident that occurred on August 16, 2021, in which
Plaintiff Roy A. Hemsley (“Plaintiff”), at the time a 13-year-old autistic
minor and middle school student, was allegedly left unattended and allowed to
run or wander five miles from his school campus before being discovered later
that day. (Complaint, ¶¶ 20-30.)
 
On
August 24, 2022, Plaintiff filed the Complaint in this action, asserting causes
of action for negligent hiring, retention, and supervision; negligence;
negligent infliction of emotional distress; and intentional infliction of emotional
distress against Defendants Los Angeles Unified School District (“LAUSD”),
County of Los Angeles (“County”), Inclusive Education and Community
Partnership, Inc. (“IECP”), Lara Ruby, Wendy De La O, Alvin Walker, Daryl
Davis, and Does 1 through 100. On October 21, 2022, the Court, at the request
of Plaintiff, dismissed all claims against County without prejudice.
 
On
February 8, 2023, the Court sustained in part (with leave to amend in part) and
overruled in part a demurrer and granted (with leave to amend in part) a motion
to strike.
 
On
March 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint (the “FAC”),
asserting causes of action for negligent hiring, retention, and supervision;
negligence; and intentional infliction of emotional distress against the same
defendants (except for County).
 
On
May 15, 2023, the Court sustained (with leave to amend) a demurrer to the negligent
hiring, retention, and supervision and the intentional infliction of emotional
distress causes of action and granted (with leave to amend in part) a motion to
strike. Plaintiff did not amend further.
 
On
July 24, 2023, Defendants LAUSD, Walker, and Davis filed their Answer to the
FAC. On
the
same day, LAUSD filed a Cross-Complaint against IECP and Roes 1 through 50.
 
On
July 26, 2023, Defendants IECP and De La O filed their Answer to the FAC. On
the same
day,
IECP also filed a Cross-Complaint against LAUSD and Moes 1 through 50, and an
Answer to LAUSD’s Cross-Complaint.
 
On August 4, 2023, LAUSD filed an answer to IECP’s
Cross-Complaint.

On January
17, 2024, the Court GRANTED IECP’s motion to deem Plaintiff to have admitted
the matters specified in IECP’s Requests for Admissions propounded on Plaintiff
(the “January 17 Order”).
On
February 14, 2024, IECP and De La O (“Defendants”) filed this motion for
summary judgment. The hearing was initially scheduled for May 1.  On May 1, the Court continued the hearing to
June 3.
On May 20,
2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion.  On May 29, 2024, Defendants filed a reply and
objections to Plaintiff’s evidence.  On
June 3 (the morning of the hearing, Plaintiff filed a supplemental declaration
in support of the opposition).  At the
hearing, the Court continued the hearing again, this time to July 29.
On June
14, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to withdraw the admissions made by the January
17 Order.  That motion was set for
hearing on July 16.  Defendants filed an
opposition on July 2.  Because of the
illness of the judicial officer, the hearing was continued to July 25. 
On July
25, 2024, the Court granted the motion to withdraw the admissions, subject to
the condition that Plaintiff serve verified and code complaint responses.  The Court also continued the hearing on Defendants’
motion for summary judgment to August 13.
On July
26, Plaintiff filed a notice stating that he had satisfied the condition that
he serve verified and code complaint responses to the requests for admission.
Legal Standard
“The purpose of
the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), “requires the trial judge to grant summary
judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of
the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67,
citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367,
381-382.)
As to each cause of
action as framed by the complaint, a defendant moving for summary judgment or
summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting
facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of action ... cannot be
established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25
Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.
850-851.)
A plaintiff or cross-complainant
moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial
burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that there is no defense to a
cause of action if that party has proved each element of the cause of action
entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has met that
burden, the burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show that a
“triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action
or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
The party opposing
a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not simply “rely upon
the allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set forth the
specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable issue of
material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.)
Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the
party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in
favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th
384, 389.)
Request for Judicial

take judicial notice of a number of enumerated documents in the Court’s file in
this action.  The request is granted.

“[A]
deemed admitted order establishes, by judicial fiat, that a nonresponding party
has responded to the requests by admitting the truth of all matters contained
therein.” (Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 979.)  The Court may take judicial notice of
admissions that “contain statements of the plaintiff or his agent which are
inconsistent with the allegations of the pleading before the court.” (Del E.
Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604-605.)
If a party does not move the trial court to allow for withdrawal or amendment
of an admission, the admission is conclusively established against that party
in the action. (See Joyce v. Ford Motor Co. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1478,
1489.) 
The
basic elements of a cause of action for negligence are: (1) the existence of a
legal duty; (2) breach of that duty; (3) causation; and (4) resulting
damages. (Brown v. USA Taekwondo (2021) 11 Cal.5th 204, 213; Kesner
v. Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1158; Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp
(2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998.) 
 
Defendants
move for summary judgment based on Plaintiff’s admissions, including the
admissions that Defendants were not negligent, and that Plaintiff was not
harmed or damaged as a result of the incident. 
On
July 25, 2024, however, The Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to withdraw the
admissions (subject to a condition that was satisfied on July 26).
Without
the benefit of the admissions, Defendants have not met their initial burden, as
moving parties on a motion for summary judgment, of presenting facts to show “that one or more
elements of the cause of action ... cannot be established, or that there is a
complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(p)(2).)  
Accordingly, Defendants’
motion for summary judgment is DENIED.
Conclusion
The Court
DENIES Defendants’ motion for summary judgment.
 
Moving
parties to give notice.
