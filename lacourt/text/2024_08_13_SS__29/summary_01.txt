```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to quash service of summons filed by defendant Sean Chan Lee. The court finds that the service of summons on Lee at an address that was not his residence was not valid. Lee did not reside at the address where he was served, and the plaintiff was aware of his actual residence on Ascot Circle in Huntington Beach but was unable to serve him there. The court concludes that the service was not properly served and grants the motion to quash.
