21STCV11988
Motion to Quash filed by Defendant
Sean Chan Lee
Tentative
The motion is granted.
BACKGROUND
 
On March 29,
2021, Adanna Ubachukwu (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Fadi Ragmab, R.
Ragheb, Sean Chen Lee, Home Owner’s Association of 1638/1640 W. 227th
Street Community Association, Nationwide Property Management, and Does 1
through 100, asserting causes of action for negligence, premises liability,
Intentional Tort – Battery, and Strict Liability, arising out of a dog bite
incident occurring on April 4, 2019.
 
On May 3, 2024,
default was entered against Fadi Ragmab and Sean Chen Lee. 
 
On May 6, 2024, Sean
Chan Lee (erroneously sued as Sean Chen Lee) (“Lee”) filed this motion to quash
service of summons. Plaintiff filed an opposition on June 4, 2024.  Lee filed a reply on August 7.
 
The hearing was
originally scheduled for July 11 and was continued by the Court.
 
While this motion
was pending: (1) the default of Lee was set aside, based on the stipulation of
the parties; and (2) Lee filed an answer on July 1. 


LEGAL STANDARD
Proper service of a summons on each defendant
is a constitutional and statutory requirement in all civil actions.  Without proper service (or, for example,
consent or waiver), a court does not acquire jurisdiction over a defendant, and
in general any judgment rendered against the defendant is void.  (E.g., Kremerman v. White (2021) 71
Cal.App.5th 358, 371; County of San Diego v. Gorham (2010) 186
Cal.App.4th 1215, 1231.)
The Code of Civil Procedure provides for
service on a defendant within the State of California by four basic methods:
(1) personal service; (2) substitute service; (3) service by mail and
acknowledgement of receipt; and (4) service by publication.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 415.10, 415.20,
415.30, 415.50.)
A defendant may challenge service through a
motion to quash service of the summons filed under Code of Civil Procedure
section 418.10, subdivision (a)(1).  
“When a defendant challenges the court’s
personal jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of process the burden
is on the plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia,
the facts requisite to an effective service.” 
(Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413; see also,
e.g., Lebel v. Mai (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1154, 1163.)  Although the filing of a proof of service by
a registered process server creates a rebuttable presumption that service was
proper (see Evid. Code § 647), that presumption may be rebutted by contrary
evidence submitted by a defendant. (See, e.g., Fernandes v. Singh (2017)
16 Cal.App.5th 932, 941 n.6.)
Although a general appearance generally
waives any alleged defect in service, the filing of a demurrer or answer concurrently
with or after the filing of a motion to quash service does not constitute a
general appearance.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
418.10, subd. (e)(1).)
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff filed with the Court on May 3,
2024, a proof of service of the summons and complaint on Lee.  According to the proof of service, Lee was
served by substitute service at his “dwelling house or usual place of abode” on
February 7, 2024.  The summons and
complaint were delivered to an individual named Marshe Hotoro at 1640 W. 227th
Street, #2, Torrance, California (the “Service Address”) and then later that
same day mailed to Lee at the same address. 
The proof of service is executed by Godwin Opara, who is not a
registered process server.  
 
In support of his motion, Lee states that
the Service Address is not now and has never been his residence.  (Lee Decl., ¶ 2.)  Since 2009, Lee states, he has lived at an
address on Ascot Circle in Huntington Beach. 
(Ibid.)  Lee also submits a
declaration from Massiel Hurtado, who states that she has lived at the Service
Address since January 2024, and Lee has not lived there during that time.  (Hurtado Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.)
 
Plaintiff presents no contrary
evidence.  Indeed, Plaintiff apparently was
aware of Lee’s residence on Ascot Circle in Huntington Beach but was unable to
serve him there.  (Onyejekwe Decl., Exh.
A.)  Plaintiff contends that Lee is
attempting to evade service. 
 
The Court has considered all of the
evidence in the records and the arguments presented by both sides.  The Court finds that Lee did not, at the time
of service, reside at the Service Address: it was not, in the words of the
statute, Lee’s “dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business,
or usual mailing address.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 415.20, subd. (b).) 
Accordingly, service was not validly or properly served.
 
The motion to quash is granted.  
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The Court GRANTS Sean Chan Lee’s motion to
quash service of summons.
 
The Judicial
Assistant is directed to give notice.
