 Case Number:  22STCV01966    Hearing Date:   August 13, 2024    Dept:  29 Galstyan v. Lai
22STCV01966
Defendant Allstate’s Demurrer
Defendant Allstate’s Motion to Strike
Tentative
Allstate’s demurrer is sustained, with leave
to amend, as to all causes of action in the Second Amended Complaint asserted
against Allstate (the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Causes of Action.)
Allstate’s motion to strike all allegations
against it in the Second Amended Complaint is denied.  The remainder of Allstate’s motion to strike
is denied as moot.
Background
These two consolidated cases arise out of a fire that occurred on
October 28, 2020, on Pasadena Avenue in Los Angeles.
In the lead case, Case No. 22STCV01966, Plaintiff Tigran Galstyan
(“Galstyan”) filed a complaint on January 18, 2022, against Defendant Wing Lai
(“Lai”), and Does 1 through 25, alleging nine causes of action for:
(1) Negligence, (2) Trespass, (3) Private Nuisance, (4) Violation of
Health and Safety Code section 13007, (5) Negligent Misrepresentation, (6)
Intentional Misrepresentation, (7) Concealment, (8) Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress, and (9) Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress.
According to the complaint, a large fire originated on Lai’s property and
spread to Galstyan’s causing extensive damage, and then Lai made misrepresentations
about the cause and origin of the fire, causing Galstyan to suffer further
damages and emotion distress.
Lai filed her answer to the complaint on March 16, 2022.
In a separate case, Case No. 22STCV14996, Plaintiff Allstate
Insurance Company (“Allstate”) filed its complaint against Galstyan and Does 1
through 20 on May 5, 2022, asserting three causes of action in subrogation for:
(1) Premises Liability, (2) General Negligence, and (3) Trespass.
In its complaint, Allstate alleges that it insured Lai’s property; that
Galstyan’s actions or inactions caused the fire and resulting damage to Lai’s
property; and that as a result Allstate suffered a loss. Galstyan filed his
answer on July 5, 2022.
The two cases were related on August 5, 2022, and consolidated for
all purposes on May 19, 2023.
On February 21, 2024, Galstyan amended the complaint to name Chi
Man Wong (“Wong”) as Doe 1.
On March 11, 2024, the Court granted in part, and denied in part,
Defendant Lai’s motion for judgment on the pleadings.  The Court
granted Galstyan leave to amend.
On March 25, 2024, Galstyan filed the First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”).  In the FAC, Galstyan named as defendants Lai, Wong,
Allstate, and Does 2 through 25; Galstyan alleged eleven causes of action: (1)
Negligence, (2) Trespass, (3) Private Nuisance, (4) Violation of Health and
Safety Code section 13007, (5) Promissory Estoppel/Fraud, (6) Negligent
Misrepresentation, (7) Concealment, (8) Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress, (9) Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress, (10) Violation of
California Business and Professions Code section 17200, and (11) Tort of
Another.
On April 24, 2024, Defendants Lai and Wong (collectively,
“Defendants”) filed a demurrer to the FAC. 
On May 21, 2024, the court sustained the demurrer in part and overruled
the demurrer in part.  Specifically, the
Court overruled the demurrer as to the Sixth and Eleventh Causes of Action
(Negligent Misrepresentation and Tort of Anotheer); sustained the demurrer as
to Eighth Cause of Action with leave to amend (Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress); and sustained the demurrer to the Ninth Cause of Action without
leave to amend (Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress).
On June 11, 2024, Galstyan filed an amendment to complaint naming
Allstate as Doe 2.
On June 13, 2024, Galstyan filed the Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”).  In
the SAC, Plaintiff names as defendants Lai, Wong, Allstate, and Does 3 through
25; Galstyan alleges nine causes of action: (1) Negligence, (2) Trespass, (3)
Private Nuisance, (4) Violation of Health and Safety Code section 13007, (5)
Promissory Estoppel/Fraud, (6) Negligent Misrepresentation, (7) Concealment,
(8) Violation of California Business and Professions Code section 17200, and (9)
Tort of Another.
On July 16, 2024, Allstate filed this demurrer and motion
to strike. Galstyan filed oppositions and a request for judicial notice on July
31.  Allstate filed replies on August 6. 
 
On July 24, 2024, Lai and Wong filed an answer to the
SAC.
 
Legal
Standard
Demurrer
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10 provides:
“The party against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been
filed may object, by demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430.30, to the
pleading on any one or more of the following grounds:
(a) The court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the
cause of action alleged in the pleading.
(b) The person who filed the pleading does not have the
legal capacity to sue.
(c) There is another action pending between the same
parties on the same cause of action.
(d) There is a defect or misjoinder of parties.
(e) The pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.
(f) The pleading is uncertain. As used in this subdivision,
“uncertain” includes ambiguous and unintelligible.
(g) In an action founded upon a contract, it cannot be
ascertained from the pleading whether the contract is written, is oral, or is
implied by conduct.
(h) No certificate was filed as required by Section 411.35.”
A
general demurrer for sufficiency under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10,
subdivision (e), tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or
law.  We also consider matters which may
be judicially noticed.”  (Centinela
Freeman Emergency Medical Associates v. Health Net of California (2016) 1
Cal.5th 994, 1010; Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; accord Yvanova
v. New Century Mortgage Corp. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 919, 924; Marina Pacific
Hotel and Suites v. Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th
96, 104.)
Courts must “liberally construe the pleading” and “give the
complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in
context.”  (Marina Pacific Hotel and
Suites, supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at p. 105.)
A demurrer can be sustained only when it
disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp.
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev.
Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)
Leave to amend should be granted when “there is a
reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.”  (Centinela Freeman, supra, 1 Cal.5th
at p. 1010; Blank, supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 318; Shaeffer v. Califia
Farms (2020) 44 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1145.)
Motion to Strike
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 435, “Any party, within the
time allowed to respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to
strike the whole or any part thereof.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 435, subd. (b)(1).)
Code of Civil Procedure section 436 provides as follows:
“The court may, upon a motion
made pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms
it deems proper:
(a) Strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.
(b) Strike out all or any
part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this
state, a court rule, or an order of the court.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 436.)  In ruling on a motion to
strike, the court must assume the truth of the properly pleaded facts in the
complaint or other pleading. (Turman v. Turning Point of Central California,
Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.)
Request for Judicial Notice
Galstyan asks the Court to take judicial notice of two
documents in the case file in this action. 
That request is GRANTED. 
Meet and Confer Requirement
Before filing a demurrer or motion to strike, the parties
must meet and confer.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a) & 435.5, subd. (a).)
The parties have satisfied the meet and
confer requirements.  (Stepanyan Decl., ¶¶
2-3 & Exhs. 1-3.)
Discussion
Demurrer
Allstate demurs to the SAC on the following
grounds: (1) that all causes of action asserted in the SAC against it (the
Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Causes of Action) are barred by the litigation
privilege; (2) that in the Fifth Cause of Action (Promissory Estoppel/Fraud),
Galstyan does not sufficiently allege facts regarding the alleged misrepresentation,
does not sufficiently allege that Allstate did not intend to perform when the
promise was made, does not sufficiently allege reliance and damages, and is
barred by the statute of limitations; (3) that in the Sixth Cause of Action (Negligent
Misrepresentation), Galstyan seeks to recover based on an expression of intent,
not an assertion of fact, Galstyan does not sufficiently allege that Allstate
did not intend to perform when the promise was made, and Galstyan does not
sufficiently allege reliance and damages; (4) that in the Seventh Cause of
Action (Concealment), Galstyan does not sufficiently allege a duty to disclose
or an assertion of material fact; and (5) that in the Eighth Cause of Action (Violation
of California Business and Professions Code section 17200), Galstyan does not
sufficiently allege any unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent conduct and does not
sufficiently allege a basis for any remedy available to a private litigant (an
injunction or restitution).
Litigation Privilege
Allstate’s first argument is that all of the
causes of action in the SAC against it are barred by the Litigation Privilege.
(Mem., at p. 14.)  
Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b),
establishes the litigation privilege. 
Subject to certain important exceptions, the litigation privilege prevents
liability from attaching to a party for making a communication that is “(1)
made in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by litigants or other
participants authorized by law; (3) to achieve the objects of the litigation;
and (4) that have some connection or logical relation to the action.” (People
ex rel. Gallegos v. Pacific Lumber Co. (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 950, 958,
quoting Silberg v. Anderson (1990) 50 Cal.3d 205, 212.)  Where the basis of the litigation privilege
appears on the face of the complaint or from judicially noticeable facts, the
litigation privilege can be adjudicated on demurrer.  (See Silberg, supra, 50 Cal.3d at p. 220.)
The litigation privilege protects communications
after a lawsuit is filed and also protects at least some prelawsuit
communications as well. (Hagberg v. California Fed'l Bank FSB (2004) 32
Cal.4th 350, 360-362; Edwards v. Centex Real Estate Corp. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th
15, 34-36.)  When prelawsuit communications
are in issue, however, factual issues may in certain circumstances preclude a
court from determining on demurrer whether the litigation privilege applies.  “Whether a prelitigation communication
relates to litigation that is contemplated in good faith and under serious
consideration is an issue of fact.” (Strawn v. Morris, Polich & Purdy,
LLP (2019) 30 Cal.App.5th 1087, 1095.)
Here, Galstyan’s causes of action against
Allstate are based primarily on the following allegations: (1) that Allstate
falsely represented to Galstyan in December 2020 that it would forego any
efforts to seek subrogation for the loss sustained by Lai; (2) Galstyan relied
on that representation; (3) in reliance on that representation, Galstyan took
no action to investigate the cause of the fire, and took no action to prevent
Allstate from cleaning and repairing the property, resulting in the loss of
critical evidence; and (4) in November 2021, Allstate informed Galstyan that it
would pursue subrogation against him. 
(SAC, ¶¶ 4, 47-51, 54-57, 77-123.)
On this record, in this procedural posture,
the Court cannot determine whether Allstate’s alleged prelitigation
communication in December 2020 was made at a time that litigation was contemplated
in good faith and under serious consideration. 
Viewing the allegations in the SAC in the light most favorable to the
plaintiff, the litigation privilege might well not apply to this prelitigation
communication.  Accordingly, the Court
must overrule the demurrer Allstate’s demurrer to the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh,
and Eighth Causes of Action in the SAC against it on litigation privilege grounds.
 
Fifth Cause of Action – Promissory Estoppel/Fraud
In
the Fifth Cause of Action, Galstyan asserts that Allstate falsely and fraudulently
represented that it would forego any subrogation claim against him, when in
fact Allstate at the time secretly intended to pursue such a subrogation
claim.  (SAC, ¶¶ 80, 82.)
Causes
of action based on fraud must be pleaded with particularity.
“This
particularity requirement necessitates pleading facts which show how, when,
where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.  A plaintiff’s burden in asserting a fraud
claim against a corporate employer is even greater.  In such a case, the plaintiff must allege the
names of the persons who made the allegedly fraudulent representations, their
authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it
was said or written.”
(Lazar
v. Super Ct. (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645 [citations and internal quotations
omitted]; accord Robinson Helicopter Co. v. Dana Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th
979, 993; Glaski v. Bank of America (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1079,
1090-1092.)
Galstyan
does not satisfy this pleading requirement. 
His allegations regarding Allstate’s fraudulent promise not to pursue subrogation
in December 2020 are too general to state a cause of action for fraud.  (See SAC, ¶¶ 4, 47, 80.)
Accordingly,
Allstate’s demurrer to the Fifth Cause of Action is sustained with leave to
amend.
(Allstate
also contends that this cause of action is barred by the statute of
limitations, but Allstate was added to this action by Doe amendment, and so, at
least for pleading purposes, and at least on this record, the causes of action
asserted against it in the SAC relate back to the date that the complaint was
filed.)
Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Causes of Action – Negligent
Misrepresentation, Concealment, and Section 17200
Galstyan’s Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Causes of Action against Allstate
also all sound in fraud.  Galstyan
alleges, in essence, that Allstate’s false representation in December 2020 that
it would not pursue subrogation against him is actionable under the theories of
negligent misrepresentation (that the representation was made without
reasonable grounds for believing to be true), concealment (that Allstate’s
secret plan, all along, to pursue subrogation against Galstyan was wrongfully
concealed from him), and section 17200 (that the false representation was an unlawful,
unfair, or fraudulent business practice).
Because the causes of action, in this context, all sound in fraud, the
heightened pleading requirement for fraud applies to these causes of action as
well.  The Court recognizes that the
rule, as stated here, is not free from doubt but concludes that this is the better
reasoned view: where, as here, the essence of the cause of action is fraud, particularity
in pleading is required.  (E.g., Daniels v. Select Portfolio Servicing
(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1150,
1166 [disapproved on other grounds by Sheen v. Wells Fargo Bank (2022) 12 Cal.5th 905, 948]; see
also Small v. Fritz
Cos. (2003) 30 Cal.4tha
167, 184 [recognizing that the matter is unsettled].)
Galstyan has not pleaded any of these causes of action with the particularity
required for a fraud-based claim. 
Accordingly, the demurrer to each of these causes of action is sustained
with leave to amend.
Motion to Strike
 
Allstate moves to strike the entire SAC, or in the
alternative, the following portions of Plaintiff’s SAC:
 
(1)             
“Allstate thereafter allowed the property to be cleaned, paid for
the cleaning and repair, resulting in spoliation of evidence of the cause and
origin of the fire.” (SAC, ¶ 4);
(2)             
“[D]ue to Allstate’s … spoliation of the evidence” (SAC, ¶ 4);
(3)             
SAC, ¶¶ 42–46, 85, 115–117 in their entirety;
(4)             
“[A]nd emotional distress” (SAC, ¶¶ 94, 100); and
(5)             
“[A]nd including emotional distress damages” (SAC, ¶ 102).
 
First,
Allstate contends the entire SAC should be stricken on procedural grounds.
 
The
initial complaint in the lead case did not assert any causes of action against
Allstate, at least not by name.  The
defendants at that time were Lai and Does 1 through 25.  Subsequently, Galstyan named Wong as Doe 1.
On March 11, 2024, the Court ruled on Defendant Lai’s motion for
judgment on the pleadings.  The Court granted the motion in part and
granted Galstyan leave to amend.
On March 25, 2024, Galstyan filed the FAC.  In addition to modifying some of the allegations
that the Court had found to be deficient, Galstyan also added in Allstate as a
new defendant.  This was not authorized
or proper.  As the Court of Appeal has
explained:
“Following an order
sustaining a demurrer or a motion for judgment on the pleadings with leave to
amend, the plaintiff may amend his or her complaint only as authorized by the
court's order. [Citation.] The plaintiff may not amend the complaint to add a
new cause of action without having obtained permission to do so, unless the new
cause of action is within the scope of the order granting leave to amend.” 
(Harris v. Wachovia Mortgage, FSB (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th
1018, 1023; see also 1 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure Before Trial [2024] ¶ 6:635.5.)
Lai and Wong then demurred to the FAC.  The Court sustained the demurrer in part and
granted Galstyan leave to amend only as to the Eighth Cause of Action (Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress).  When
Galstyan filed the SAC (on June 13), he omitted this cause of action.
Meanwhile, on June 11, 2024, Galstyan filed an amendment to
complaint naming Allstate as Doe 2.
Galstyan did not initially following the proper procedure to add Allstate
as a party.  To the contrary, the allegations
in the FAC (filed on March 25) against Allstate were improper: these new
allegations against a new party were not within the scope of the leave to amend
granted by the Court at the hearing on March 11, 2024; Galstyan did not file a
motion for leave to amend to add a new party; and, at the time, Galstyan had
not filed a Doe amendment to add Allstate to the complaint.
If Allstate
had moved to strike the allegations against it in the FAC, that motion might well
have been granted.  But the allegations against
Allstate in the FAC are not before the Court at this time.  The FAC has been superseded by the SAC, and
Allstate now moves to strike the allegations against it in the SAC.  But before Galstyan filed the SAC, he filed a
Doe amendment, naming Allstate as Doe 2.
 
As of the
date of the filing of the SAC, Allstate had been properly added to the case
through the Doe amendment procedure.  Accordingly,
the motion to strike all allegations against Allstate in the SAC on procedural
grounds is denied.  
 
The
remainder of Allstate’s motion to strike is denied as moot, as the Court has
sustained (with leave to amend) the demurrer to all causes of action in the SAC
alleged against Allstate.
 
Conclusion
The Court
SUSTAINS Allstate’s Demurrer to all causes of action against it in the SAC (the
Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Causes of Action), with leave to amend.
The Court GRANTS
Plaintiff leave to amend within 14 days of notice.
The Court DENIES
Allstate’s motion to strike all allegations against it in the SAC on procedural
grounds.  The Court DENIES AS MOOT the
remainder of Allstate’s motion to strike.
Moving Party is
to give notice.
