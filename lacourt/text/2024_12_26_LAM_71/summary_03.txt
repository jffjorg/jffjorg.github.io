  - "The policy favoring amendment is so strong that denial of leave to amend can rarely be justified: If the motion to amend is timely made and the granting of the motion will not prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse permission to amend and where the refusal also results in a party being deprived of the right to assert a meritorious cause of action or a meritorious defense, it is not only error but an abuse of discretion."

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the Defendants' motion for leave to amend their cross-complaint to file a proposed third amended cross-complaint (TAXC). The proposed TAXC seeks to clarify certain allegations, add further allegations, and explicitly seek relief under Business and Professions Code §7031(b) regarding newly uncovered circumstances of certain contract construction work performed by inadequately licensed subcontractors. The Judge finds that the motion substantially complies with California Rules of Court Rule 3.1324(a) and (b) and that the proposed amendment is necessary and proper. The Judge also notes that Plaintiff's argument that the proposed amendment should be denied on the basis Plaintiff unreasonably delayed in bringing the motion is unavailing. The Judge orders the Defendants to file and serve the proposed TAXC with the Court by December 27, 2024, and Plaintiff then has 14 days within which to respond to the TAXC.
