CRAIG STEVEN ROBERTS, et al.,  
  
         vs.
 
DOES 1 THROUGH 250.


 Case No.: 
  20STCV20443
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  December 26, 2024



 
Defendant Slurry Explosive Corporation’s
unopposed motion for judgment on the pleadings against Plaintiffs Craig
Steven Roberts and Carla Roxanna Roberts first amended complaint is granted without
leave to amend.
 
Defendant Slurry Explosive Corporation (“Slurry”) (“Moving Defendant”)
moves unopposed for judgment on the pleadings of Plaintiffs Craig Steven
Roberts (“Craig”) and Carla Roxanna Roberts (“Carla”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) first amended complaint (“FAC”). 
(Notice Motion, pg. 2.)  Slurry moves
on the grounds that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute
a cause of action as to Slurry because Plaintiffs failed to timely commence the
action and therefore are barred by the applicable toxic tort statute of
limitations set forth in C.C.P. §340.8.  (Notice
Motion, pg. 2.)  Slurry also moves on the
ground that Plaintiffs failed to meet the mandatory requirements of C.C.P. §474
in order for their purported doe amendment of Slurry to relate back to the original
complaint. (Notice Motion, pg. 2.) 
Slurry argues Plaintiffs’ original complaint failed to state a toxic
tort claim against Slurry because they failed to meet the pleading standard
articulated in Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th
71 to identify specific products containing toxic substances—instead alleging
the products “will be identified during the course of investigation and
discovery.” Finally, Slurry moves on the ground that Craig was not actually
ignorant of Slurry’s identity to take advantage of the fictious name statute.  (Notice Motion, pg. 2.)
 
Request for Judicial Notice
Slurry’s 10/1/24 request for judicial notice of (1) Plaintiffs’
Complaint for Toxic Injuries filed May 28, 2020; (2) Plaintiffs’ Amendment to
Complaint filed May 1, 2023; (3) Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Toxic
Injuries filed September 1, 2023; (4) Plaintiffs’ Proof of Service of Summons
as to Slurry Explosives Corporation filed September 27, 2023; and (5) Slurry’s
Answer to Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint filed October 23, 2023 in the
instant action is denied because the Court does not need to take judicial
notice of filings on the instant docket.
Slurry’s 10/1/24 request for judicial notice of extracts from the
certified trial preservation deposition transcript of Craig taken in the
above-captioned action via Zoom on May 23, 2024, is granted.  (D-RJN, Exh. 6)
 
Background
Plaintiffs filed their initial complaint on May 28, 2020.  Plaintiffs filed an amendment to the
Complaint naming Slurry as DOE No. 13 on May 1, 2023.  Plaintiffs filed the operative FAC on September
1, 2023, alleging six causes of action: (1) negligence; (2) strict liability-
failure to warn; (3) strict liability- design defect; (4) fraudulent
concealment; (5) breach of implied warranties; and (6) loss of consortium.  On September 27, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a
proof of service serving Slurry with the FAC by mail.
On October 1, 2024, Slurry filed the instant motion.  As of the date of this hearing no opposition
has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
“A motion for judgment on the pleadings may be made at any time
either prior to the trial or at the trial itself.”  (Stoops v. Abbassi (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th
644, 650; see also Korchemny v. Piterman (2021) 68 Cal.App.5th 1032,
1055 [“common law ground for a motion for judgment on the pleadings is
identical to the statutory ground”].)
The grounds for a motion for judgment on the pleadings must appear
on the face of the challenged pleading or be based on facts the court may
judicially notice.  (C.C.P. §438(d); Tung
v. Chicago Title Co. (2021) 63 Cal.App.5th 734, 758-759.)
Where the motion is based on matters the court may judicially
notice (under Evidence Code §§452, 453), such matters must be specified in the
notice of motion or supporting points and authorities.  (C.C.P. §438(d); compare Saltarelli &
Steponovich v. Douglas (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1, 5 [taking judicial notice
of matters in parties’ exhibits in “nonstatutory” motion for judgment on the
pleadings].)
 
          Meet and Confer
Before filing a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the moving
party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or
by video conference with the party who filed the pleading that
is subject to the motion for the purpose of determining whether an agreement
can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the motion.  (C.C.P. §439(a), emphasis added.)  A declaration must be filed with the motion
regarding the results of the meet and confer process.  (C.C.P. §439(a)(3).)
Slurry’s counsel’s declaration states that “within two weeks of
the transmission of the [meet and confer] letter [sent on August 6, 2024], my
associate Alexandra Sologub, Esq. spoke on the telephone at least twice with
Scott Brust, Esq., counsel of record for Plaintiff[s], to discuss the contents
of and issues raised in Exhibit 7. The parties were unable to resolve the
issues.”  (Decl. of Anaya ¶¶8-9.)  Slurry’s meet and confer declaration is
proper under C.C.P. §439(a)(3). 
Therefore, the Court will consider the instant motion.
 
Statute of Limitations
          Generally, the
statute of limitations applicable to personal injury claims is two years from accrual.
 (C.C.P. §335.1.) 
Plaintiffs alleged injury based upon exposure to toxic substances;
therefore, Plaintiffs’ claim accrued either two years from the date of Craig’s
alleged injury, or two years after Craig became aware or reasonably should have
become aware of (1) an injury, (2) the physical cause of the injury, and (3)
sufficient facts to put a reasonable person on inquiry notice that another’s
wrongful act caused or contributed to the injury.  (C.C.P. § 340.8.)  
“The Legislature declared that section 340.8 was intended to
codify the delayed discovery rule for personal injury and wrongful death cases involving
toxic exposure.”  (Lopez v. Sony
Electronics, Inc. (2018) 5 Cal.5th 627, 633.)
The FAC alleges six causes of action against the various named and
fictious
defendants that include fraud and breach of warranty allegations.  However, the gravamen of Plaintiffs’ action
sounds in personal injury arising out of a defective, toxic product.  When “[t]he fraud claim is merely the failure
to warn claim recast as a claim for fraudulent concealment . . . we see no
reason to depart from the general rule applying the one-year statute of
limitations to claims for product
liability however they are denominated.”  (Rivas v. Safety-Kleen Corp. (2002) 98
Cal.App.4th 218, 231 [applying an earlier version of §335.1 subsequently
amended Jan. 1, 2003, to extend the statute from one to two years].)
          Here, like in Rivas,
Plaintiffs’ fraud claim merely recasts the fraudulent concealment products
claim and should not control the applicable statute of limitations.  Craig alleged an injury based upon exposure
to a toxic substance—he was first diagnosed with MS on or about November 6,
2018.  (Complaint ¶10; FAC ¶28.)  Craig’s toxic tort claim accrued the same day
as diagnosis, with the two-year statute of limitation (with the appropriate
COVID-19 tolling) running
on May 4, 2021.  
Plaintiffs’ FAC was filed nearly two and a half years after the
statute elapsed.  Plaintiffs’ FAC does
not relate back to the initial May 2020 Complaint—nor was the DOE amendment
proper based upon Craig’s prefiling investigation.  Plaintiffs’ initial Complaint did not comply
with C.C.P. §474 because the Complaint did not state a valid toxic tort cause
of action against Slurry under the Bockrath standard. 
“The complaint must state a cause of action against each Doe
defendant.” (Fireman’s Fund Insurance Co. v. Sparks Construction, Inc.
(2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1135, 1143.)  Bockrath
requires a plaintiff to “identify each product that allegedly caused the injury
it is insufficient to allege that the toxins in defendants’ products caused
it.”  (Bockrath, 21 Cal.4th at pg.
80.)
Here, Plaintiffs’ initial Complaint did not state a valid cause of
action against Slurry because it failed identify any products specific to
Slurry, instead alleging that such products “will be identified during the
course of investigation and discovery.”  (Complaint
at pg. 2:1-4.)  Without the Bockrath-specific
product identification allegations, the initial Complaint failed to state a
claim as to Slurry as a named or fictitious defendant.
Under C.C.P. §474, fictious defendants arise out of the principle that
plaintiff’s claim has accrued but plaintiff is ignorant of the “true names” of
the defendants but otherwise state a valid cause of action.  (Dieckmann v. Superior Court (1985) 175
Cal.App.3d 345, 357.)  Section 474’s
“requirements, as so construed, are mandatory.”  (Fireman’s Fund Insurance Co., 114
Cal.App.4th at pg. 1144.)  Because
Plaintiffs failed to meet these mandatory requirements, Plaintiffs’ DOE
amendment does not relate back to the filing of the initial Complaint.
Further, ignorance of a defendant’s name is distinct from
ignorance of facts supporting the accrual of a claim against a defendant.  As Craig testified under oath inconsistent with
the pleading allegations, he was not ignorant of Slurry’s name or Slurry’s
associated product.  (D-RJN, Exh. 6 at
153:12-155:6.)
Without the benefit of the relation-back doctrine, Plaintiffs’ FAC
filed in September 2023 is well beyond the aforementioned two-year (plus
COVID-19 tolling) statute of limitations. 

Further, independent of the statute of limitations issues with
Plaintiffs’ claims, Plaintiffs failed to serve the summons and complaint on
Slurry within three years and 60 days (for time to return the proof of service)
after Plaintiffs commenced the action.  (C.C.P.
§583.210.) 
Plaintiffs commenced their action when they filed the initial Complaint
on May 28, 2020. Three years and 60 days from commencement was July 27, 2023.
Plaintiffs’ proof of service, filed September 27, 2023, indicates Plaintiffs
mail served Slurry on September 6, 2023—three years and approximately 100 days
after the commencement of the action.
While Slurry appeared via answer on October 23, 2023—after the
prescribed time in §583.210 and three and a half years after Plaintiffs
commenced the action, the exceptions to dismissal set forth in §583.220 are
inapplicable because Slurry did not make such general appearance during the
three year and 60-day time limit. 
“The plain meaning of the statute is that the
three-year-and-sixty-day time limit for return of summons is relieved by the
defendant’s general appearance during that time period.  (Wong v. Armstrong World Industries, Inc.
(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1032, 1034, emphasis added.)  Moreover, unlike the statute of limitations
tolling, the COVID-19 emergency rule did not toll or otherwise extend section
583.210’s deadline for service of process.  (People v. Financial Casualty & Surety,
Inc. (2021) 73 Cal.App.5th 33, 42; Committee for Sound Water & Land
Development v. City of Seaside (2022) 79 Cal.App.5th 389.)  Plaintiffs are not entitled to any additional
time other than what is prescribed in the statute.
Accordingly, Slurry’s motion for judgment on the pleadings of
Plaintiffs’ SAC is granted without leave to amend.
 
Conclusion
Slurry’s unopposed motion for judgment on the pleadings of
Plaintiffs’ SAC is granted without leave to amend.
Moving Party to give notice.
