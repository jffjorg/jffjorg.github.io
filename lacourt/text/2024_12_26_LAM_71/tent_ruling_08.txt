[1] The Court notes Defendant’s motion improperly
combines three motions to compel further pertaining to three different
discovery requests into a single motion. A motion must be brought separately
against each party and discovery method at issue.  The instant motion should have been filed as
three separate motions and three filing fees paid.  Instead, Defendant filed only one motion and
paid one filing fee. “[P]ayment of filing fees is both mandatory and
jurisdictional.”  (Hu v. Silgan
Containers Corp. (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1261, 1269.)  Therefore, Defendant owes this Court $120.00
in filing fees.
