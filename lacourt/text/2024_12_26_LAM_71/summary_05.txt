And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting Judgment Creditor's unopposed motion to amend the judgment to add additional "aka" names of Judgment Debtor Ronda C. Jackson. The motion is granted because Judgment Creditor has demonstrated that the additional names are aliases of the Judgment Debtor, and the court has authority to correct the name of a party or amend a judgment to add an alter ego of an original judgment debtor. The court orders Judgment Creditor to submit a proposed amended judgment within 10 days.
