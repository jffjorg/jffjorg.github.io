          Defendant Outfront Media, LLC (“Outfront”)
(“Moving Defendant”) moves to compel further responses from Plaintiff
Robert Shane Salley (“Salley”) (“Plaintiff”) to its Request for Production
of Documents (Set One) (“RFP”) to request No. 21.  (Notice of
Defendant MTCF; C.C.P. §§2030.300, 2030.310.)  Defendant requests Plaintiff and/or his
counsel of record pay monetary sanctions in the total amount of $5,355.00.  (Notice of Defendant MTCF.)[1]
          Defendant moves to
compel further responses from Plaintiff to its Request for Special
Interrogatories (Set One) (“SROG”) to request No. 15.  (Notice of
Defendant MTCF; C.C.P. §§2030.300, 2030.310.)
Defendant moves to compel further responses from Plaintiff to its Request
for Form Interrogatories – General (Set One) (“FROG”) to request No. 12.6.  (Notice
of Defendant MTCF; C.C.P. §§2030.300, 2030.310.)
          Plaintiff moves to

C.C.P. §§2023.10 et seq, 2031.300; CRC, Rules 3.1345, 3.1348.)

numbering must begin with the first page and use only Arabic numerals (e.g., 1,
2, 3). The page number may be suppressed and need not appear on the first page.”  (CRC, Rule 2.109.)
          Defendant’s
omnibus motion fails to include page numbers in violation of CRC Rule 2.109.
 
Meet and Confer
On October 15, 2024, this Court held an IDC, wherein
this Court deemed the issues discussed in the IDC unresolved.  (10/15/24 Minute Order.)  Therefore, the Court will consider the instant
motion.
 
1.     Defendant’s MTCF- RFP
Background
          On February
1, 2024, Defendant served its RFP on Plaintiff. 
(Decl. of de Leon ¶2.)  Plaintiff
was granted an extension to submit his responses, and on March 26, 2024, Plaintiff
served his unverified responses to the discovery request.  (Decl. of de Leon ¶3.)  Plaintiff served Defendant with his signed
verifications on April 12, 2024; however, verifications were dated March 27,
2024.  (Decl. of de Leon ¶4, Exh. A.)
          Defendant
filed the instant motion on November 5, 2024. 
Plaintiff filed his opposition on December 19, 2024.  As of the date of this hearing no reply has
been filed.
 
          Discussion
The Civil Discovery Act provides that a “party may
obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the
subject matter involved in the pending action or to the determination of any
motion made in that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in
evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.”  (C.C.P. §2031.010.)

“[E]vidence is ‘relevant’ if it might reasonably
assist a party in evaluating its case, preparing for trial, or facilitating a
settlement.”  (Moore v. Mercer (2016)
4 Cal.App.5th 424, 447.)  A party is
entitled to discover “any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the
subject matter involved in the pending action.”  (C.C.P. §2017.010.)  The phrase “subject matter” is broader than
relevancy to the issues (which determines admissibility of evidence at trial).  (Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1384, 1392.)  Courts
have uniformly held that, for discovery purposes, information should be
regarded as “relevant” to the subject matter if it might reasonably assist a
party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement.  (Stewart v. Colonial Western Agency, Inc. (2001)
87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1013.)
Defendant moves to compel further responses from Plaintiff
as to RFP Request No. 21.  This request
seeks production of “[a]ny and all DOCUMENTS and/or writings which in any way
reference or relate to any claims for state disability insurance benefits by
YOU from January 1, 2019 to the present.” 
(Motion Defendant SS, pg. 6.)
This request seeks production of documents
concerning state disability insurance benefits and are narrowly tailored to a
specific issue in this case.  The
requested documents are relevant to Plaintiff’s allegations that his mental
health disability, in part, was a result of Defendant’s wrongful conduct.  (See Complaint ¶¶50-54.)  Plaintiff’s boilerplate objections are not
proper.  (See Korea Data Systems Co.
v. Superior Court (1997) 51 Cal.App.4th 1513, 1516 [stating boilerplate
objections “[lack] . . . the specificity the statute mandates” and their use
may be sanctionable].)  To the extent
documents are withheld due to an objection, the response must (1) identify with
particularity the document to which the objection is being made; and (2) set
forth the grounds for the objection, including the production of a privilege
log if the objection is based on privilege.  (C.C.P. §2031.240.)
Accordingly, Plaintiff is compelled to produce
Code-Compliant responses to RFP No. 21 and corresponding documents within 20
days of this ruling.  To the extent any
responses are protected by privilege, Plaintiff is to produce a privilege log.
 
Sanctions
Under C.C.P. §2031.300(c), “[t]he court may impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling,
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling a response, the court
may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue
sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to this sanction,
the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010).”  (C.C.P. §2031.300(c).)
Defendant requests sanctions in the total amount of
$5,355.00 against Plaintiff for the three omnibus motions.  (Decl. of de Leon ¶12.)  However, Defendant’s notice of motion failed
to provide sufficient notice to Defendant of the amount of the sanction for the
motion to compel further responses for the RFP and against whom the sanctions
were requested.  (C.C.P. §2023.040.)  Defendant merely noticed its omnibus motion
for sanctions regarding interrogatories. 
(Compare Notice of Defendant’s Motion [“This motion is made
pursuant to CCP §§ 2030.300 and 2030.310 . . ..”] with C.C.P. §2031.300(c).)  Therefore, this Court cannot grant the
requested sanctions.
 
Conclusion
          Defendant’s
motion to compel further responses from Plaintiff to Defendant’s RFP Nos. 21 is granted.  Defendant
is to provide further Code-Compliant responses within 20 days.
          Defendant’s
request for sanctions against Plaintiff is denied.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling. 
 
2.     Defendant’s MTCF- SROG
Background
          On
February 1, 2024, Defendant served its SROG on Plaintiff.  (Decl. of de Leon ¶2.)  Plaintiff was granted an extension to submit
his responses, and on March 26, 2024, Plaintiff served his unverified responses
to the discovery request.  (Decl. of de
Leon ¶3.)  Plaintiff served Defendant
with his signed verifications on April 12, 2024; however, verifications were
dated March 27, 2024.  (Decl. of de Leon
¶4, Exh. A.)
          Defendant
filed the instant motion on November 5, 2024. 
Plaintiff filed his opposition on December 19, 2024.  As of the date of this hearing no reply has
been filed.
 
          Discussion
Defendant moves to compel further responses from Plaintiff
as to SROG Request No. 15.  This request states,
“[i]f any DOCUMENT CONCERNING YOUR claims and/or DEFENDANT’s defenses in this
matter is no longer in YOUR possession, custody, or control, or has been lost,
misplaced, or destroyed, IDENTIFY each such document and briefly describe why
each document is no longer in your possession, custody, or control and/or how,
when, and by whom it was lost, misplaced, or destroyed.”  (Motion Defendant SS, pg. 4.)
This interrogatory seeks information about
potentially relevant documentation that may no longer be in Plaintiff’s
possession, custody, or control, and could require third-party discovery.
Plaintiff’s responses are not Code-Compliant.  Plaintiff’s boilerplate objections are not
proper.  (See Korea Data Systems Co.,
51 Cal.App.4th at pg. 1516.)  Further,
Plaintiff’s responses are evasive.
Accordingly, Plaintiff is compelled to produce
Code-Compliant responses to SROG No. 15 within 20 days of this ruling.  To the extent any responses are protected by
privilege, Plaintiff is to produce a privilege log.
 
Sanctions
Under C.C.P. §2030.300(d), “[t]he court shall impose
a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (C.C.P. §2030.300(d).)
Defendant requests sanctions in the total amount of
$5,355.00 against Plaintiff and/or his counsel of record for the three omnibus
motions.  (Decl. of de Leon ¶12.)  However, Defendant requests sanctions for
time spent meeting and conferring, including preparing documents for the IDC,
which is part of the meet and confer process and not compensable for a motion
to compel further.  Accordingly, the
Court grants Defendant’s request for sanctions in the reduced amount of $630.00
against Plaintiff and his counsel of record, jointly and severally, calculated
as follows:
($315.00/hour x 2 hours to prepare motion, review
response, and appear for hearing) = $630.00
Sanctions are payable within 20 days.
 
Conclusion
          Defendant’s
motion to compel further responses from Plaintiff to Defendant’s SROG No. 15 is granted.  Defendant
is to provide further Code-Compliant responses within 20 days.
          Defendant’s
request for sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel of record, jointly and
severally, in the reduced amount of $630.00. 
Sanctions are payable within 20 days.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling. 
 
3.     Defendant’s MTCF- FROG
Background
          On
February 1, 2024, Defendant served its FROG on Plaintiff.  (Decl. of de Leon ¶2.)  Plaintiff was granted an extension to submit
his responses, and on March 26, 2024, Plaintiff served his unverified responses
to the discovery request.  (Decl. of de
Leon ¶3.)  Plaintiff served Defendant
with his signed verifications on April 12, 2024; however, verifications were
dated March 27, 2024.  (Decl. of de Leon
¶4, Exh. A.)
          Defendant
filed the instant motion on November 5, 2024. 
Plaintiff filed his opposition on December 19, 2024.  As of the date of this hearing no reply has
been filed.
 
          Discussion
Defendant moves to compel further responses from Plaintiff
as to FROG Request No. 12.6.  This
request states:  
Was a report made by any PERSON
concerning the INCIDENT? If so, state: (a) the name, title, identification
number, and employer of the PERSON who made the report; (b) the date and type
of report made; (c) the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the PERSON for
whom the report was made; and (d) the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of
each PERSON who has the original or a copy of the report.
 
(Motion Defendant SS, pg. 2.)
This interrogatory seeks information about
potentially relevant reports concerning the allegations made in Plaintiff’s
Complaint.
Plaintiff’s responses are not Code-Compliant.  Plaintiff’s boilerplate objections are not
proper.  (See Korea Data Systems Co.,
51 Cal.App.4th at pg. 1516.)  Further,
Plaintiff’s responses are evasive.
Accordingly, Plaintiff is compelled to produce
Code-Compliant responses to FROG No. 15 within 20 days of this ruling.  To the extent any responses are protected by
privilege, Plaintiff is to produce a privilege log.
 
Sanctions
Under C.C.P. §2030.300(d), “[t]he court shall impose
a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (C.C.P. §2030.300(d).)
Defendant requests sanctions in the total amount of
$5,355.00 against Plaintiff and/or his counsel of record for the three omnibus
motions.  (Decl. of de Leon ¶12.)  However, Defendant requests sanctions for
time spent meeting and conferring, including preparing documents for the IDC,
which is part of the meet and confer process and not compensable for a motion
to compel further.  Accordingly, the
Court grants Defendant’s request for sanctions in the reduced amount of $472.50
against Plaintiff and his counsel of record, jointly and severally, calculated
as follows:
($315.00/hour x 1.5 hours to prepare motion and
review response) = $472.50
Sanctions are payable within 20 days.
 
Conclusion
          Defendant’s
motion to compel further responses from Plaintiff to Defendant’s FROG No. 12.6 is granted.  Plaintiff
is to provide further Code-Compliant responses within 20 days.
          Defendant’s
request for sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel of record, jointly and
severally, in the reduced amount of $472.50. 
Sanctions are payable within 20 days.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling.
 
4.     Plaintiff’s MTCF- RFP
Background
          On November
22, 2023, Plaintiff served his RFP on Defendant.  (Decl. of Tojarieh ¶1, Exh. 1.)  On December 21, 2023, Plaintiff granted Defendant
an extension until January 26, 2024, to respond to the RFP.  (Decl. of de Tojarieh ¶2.)  On February 12, 2024, after Plaintiff granted
two additional extensions, Defendant
provided responses to some, but not all, of the
production requests that Plaintiff propounded. 
(Decl. of de Tojarieh ¶3, Exh. 2.) 
Defendant refused to produce documents without an agreed-upon protective
order.  (Decl. of de Tojarieh ¶3, Exh.
2.)  On February 26, 2024, the parties
submitted to this Court a Stipulation and Protective Order – Confidential
Designation Only, which this Court granted the same day.  (Decl. of de Tojarieh ¶4.)
          On
April 29, 2024, after meeting and conferring, Defendant produced some
documents. On April 30, 2024, Defendant served further responses to some
production requests and produced additional documents.  (Decl. of de Tojarieh ¶7, Exh. 5.)
          Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on November 11, 2024. 
Defendant filed its opposition on December 19, 2024.  As of the date of this hearing no reply has
been filed.
 
          Discussion
Plaintiff moves to compel further responses from Defendant
as to RFP Request Nos. 6, 8, and 9.  Request
No. 6 seeks production of “[e]ach and every DOCUMENT reflecting or constituting
COMMUNICATIONS between PLAINTIFF and any other PERSON who has knowledge of relevant
facts regarding PLAINTIFF’S claims in this action.”  (Motion Plaintiff RFP SS, pg. 2.)  Request No. 8 seeks production of “[e]ach and
every non-privileged DOCUMENT reflecting or constituting COMMUNICATIONS between
YOU and any other PERSON, including, but not limited to, witnesses and
co-defendants, who has knowledge of relevant facts regarding PLAINTIFF’S claims
in this action.”  (Motion Plaintiff RFP
SS, pg. 2.)  Request No. 9 seeks
production of “[e]ach and every non-privileged DOCUMENT reflecting or
constituting COMMUNICATIONS made by any PERSON (other than YOU or PLAINTIFF) to
any other PERSON (other than YOU or PLAINTIFF) that relate to PLAINTIFF’S
claims in this action.”  (Motion
Plaintiff RFP SS, pg. 2.)
Defendant’s boilerplate objections are not
proper.  (See Korea Data Systems Co.,
51 Cal.App.4th at pg. 1516.)  To the
extent documents are withheld due to an objection, the response must (1)
identify with particularity the document to which the objection is being made;
and (2) set forth the grounds for the objection, including the production of a
privilege log if the objection is based on privilege.  (C.C.P. §2031.240.)
Defendant’s opposition to Plaintiff’s requested
search terms is unavailing.  C.C.P.
§2031.310(d) provides: “In a motion under subdivision (a) relating to the
production of electronically stored information, the party or affected person
objecting to or opposing the production, inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling of electronically stored information on the basis that the information
is from a source that is not reasonably accessible because of the undue burden
or expense shall bear the burden of demonstrating that the information is
from a source that is not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or
expense.”  (C.C.P. §2031.310(d).)  Defendant fails to meet its burden to
demonstrate that the information sought is not reasonably accessible because of
undue burden or expense.  
Accordingly, Defendant is compelled to produce
Code-Compliant responses to RFP Nos. 6, 8, and 9 and corresponding documents
within 20 days of this ruling.  To the
extent any responses are protected by privilege, Defendant is to produce a
privilege log.
 
Conclusion
          Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses from Defendant to Plaintiff’s RFP Nos. 6, 8, and 9 is granted.  Defendant
is to provide further Code-Compliant responses within 20 days.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling. 
 
5.     Plaintiff’s MTCF- SROG
Background
          On
November 22, 2023, Plaintiff served his SROG on Defendant.  (Decl. of Tojarieh ¶1, Exh. 1.)  On December 21, 2023, Plaintiff granted Defendant
an extension until January 26, 2024, to respond to the SROG.  (Decl. of de Tojarieh ¶2.)  On February 12, 2024, after Plaintiff granted
two additional extensions, Defendant provided answers to the first 35
interrogatories that Plaintiff propounded and responded with boilerplate
objections only to the rest.  (Decl. of
de Tojarieh ¶3, Exh. 2.)  
          On
April 26, 2024, after meeting and conferring, Defendant served further
responses to some interrogatories. 
(Decl. of de Tojarieh ¶6, Exh. 5.) 
On October 4, 2024, Defendant provided further responses to the
interrogatories.  (Decl. of de Tojarieh
¶13, Exh. 9.)
          Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on November 11, 2024. 
Defendant filed its opposition on December 19, 2024.  As of the date of this hearing no reply has
been filed.
 
          Discussion
Plaintiff moves to compel further responses from Defendant
as to SROG Nos. 28 and 71.  Request No.
28 states, “IDENTIFY each PERSON who worked in the same department or division
as PLAINTIFF during the APPLICABLE TIME PERIOD.”  (Motion Plaintiff SROG SS, pg. 2.)
Request No. 71 states, “IDENTIFY each PERSON who,
during the RELEVANT TIME PERIOD, worked for YOU in California in the same
position as or a position substantially similar to any of those held by
PLAINTIFF.”  (Motion Plaintiff SROG SS,
pg. 7.)
These interrogatories seek information about potential
witnesses to the conduct alleged in Plaintiff’s Complaint or individuals
similarly situated.
Defendant’s responses are not Code-Compliant.  Defendant’s boilerplate objections are not
proper.  (See Korea Data Systems Co.,
51 Cal.App.4th at pg. 1516.)  Further, Defendant’s
responses are evasive.
Accordingly, Defendant is compelled to produce
Code-Compliant responses to SROG Nos. 28 and 71 within 20 days of this
ruling.  To the extent any responses are
protected by privilege, Defendant is to produce a privilege log.
 
Conclusion
          Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses from Defendant to Plaintiff’s SROG Nos. 28 and 71 is granted.  Defendant
is to provide further Code-Compliant responses within 20 days.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling.
