And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to set aside deemed admitted RFAs and amend the RFAs. The plaintiff failed to respond to RFAs due to excusable neglect caused by the unexpected withdrawal of her previous attorney and her subsequent retention of new counsel. The defendant does not show how allowing the amendment of the admissions would substantially prejudice them. The trial date is set for February 9, 2026, leaving the defendant time to conduct further discovery and present their case.

The judge denies the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The motion is based on the deemed admitted RFAs, but since the court grants the plaintiff's motion to set aside the deemed admitted RFAs, the defendant has no basis for the motion.
