TENTATIVE
RULING
            
            Plaintiff Pnina Gillete Motion To Set Aside Deemed
Admitted RFAs and Amend the RFAs pursuant to CCP § 2300.300 is GRANTED. The
Court orders Plaintiff’s Deemed Admitted RFAs to be set aside, and Plaintiff is
ordered to serve her amended RFA responses onto Defendant immediately after the
hearing. 
 
            Defendant
UDR Marina Pointe LLC’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is DENIED.
Defendant’s motion is entirely based on Plaintiff’s RFAs being deemed admitted.
Plaintiff’s motion to set aside deemed admitted RFAs and amend the RFAs was
GRANTED, and thus there is no further basis for the Defendants judgment on the
pleadings motion. 
 
REASONING
            
I.               
Gillete’s Motion to Set Aside Deemed Admitted
RFAs and Amend RFAs
            To request a court to vacate a
request for admissions that has been deemed admitted, a party must file a
motion with the court under Code of Civil Procedure Section 2033.300. (See
generally Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973.)
 
(a) A party may withdraw
or amend an admission made in response to a request for admission only on leave
of court granted after notice to all parties.
(b) The court may permit
withdrawal or amendment of an admission only if it determines that the
admission was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and
that the party who obtained the admission will not be substantially prejudiced
in maintaining that party's action or defense on the merits.
(c) The court may impose
conditions on the granting of the motion that are just, including, but not
limited to, the following:
(1) An order that the
party who obtained the admission be permitted to pursue additional discovery
related to the matter involved in the withdrawn or amended admission.
(2) An order that the
costs of any additional discovery be borne in whole or in part by the party
withdrawing or amending the admission.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.300.)
 
Because
the law strongly favors trial and disposition on the merits, any doubts in
applying section 2033.300 must be resolved in favor of the party seeking
relief. (New Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th
1403, 1420.) “Accordingly, the court's discretion to deny a motion under the
statute is limited to circumstances where it is clear that the mistake,
inadvertence, or neglect was inexcusable, or where it is clear that the
withdrawal or amendment would substantially prejudice the party who obtained
the admission in maintaining that party's action or defense on the merits. (Id.,
at pp. 1420–1421.)


            On 2-21-23, Defendant UDR Marina Pointe, LLC (“UDR”)
served RFAs on Plaintiff Pnina Gillete (“Gillete”) with responses due on
3-26-24. Gillete failed to provide a timely response, URD filed the Motion to
deem RFAs admitted on 4-16-24, and on 6-25-24, the Court deemed the admissions
admitted. 
 
Gillete
argues that her failure to respond to RFAs was due to excusable neglect
pursuant to CCP § 2033.300(b). The excusable neglect was due to Gillete’s
previous attorney’s unexpected withdrawal from the case on 1-31-24, leaving
Gillete “in a state of confusion and great anxiety about having no assistance
of counsel.” (Gillette Decl., ¶ 5.) Gillete declares that this state of
confusion and anxiety regarding the lack of counsel made her “unable to respond
to the requests for admission until new legal counsel was retained on July 19,
2024.” (Id., ¶ 5.) Gillete further declares that she did not understand
the legal implications or appreciate the severe consequences of non-compliance”
of not responding to RFAs, nor did she voluntarily choose to be
self-represented. (Id., ¶¶ 6–7.) Gillete declares that upon retaining
new counsel on 7-19-24 she “immediately began to effectively address [the]
situation,” including filing this motion on 7-30-24. (Id., ¶ 8.) Gillete
attached the proposed RFA responses to the motion. (See Henriks Decl., ¶ 5, Ex.
A.) 
 
More
important, UDR fails to show how allowing the the amendment of the admissions would
substantially prejudice UDR. UDR argues it has “expended great resources in
pursuing motion work with regard to discovery and its Motion for Judgment on
the Pleadings.” (Opposition, p. 7:19–28.) UDR provides no authority the cost
UDR incurred pursuing the stated motions supports the denial of the motions
substantially prejudices its ability to defend the case with the admissions are
withdrawn. The trial set for 2-9-26, leaving UDR time to conduct further
discovery and to fully present their case with the addition of Gillette’s
amended RFA responses. Thus, UDR will not be prejudiced by the granting of this
motion.
 
Because
California has a strong policy of favoring trial on the merits, and any doubts
of applying CCP § 2033.300 should be resolved in favor of the moving
party, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s delay in serving the RFA responses was
the result of excusable neglect.  
 
Gillete’s
Motion To Set Aside Deemed RFAs Admitted and Amend the RFAs pursuant to CCP
§ 2300.300 is GRANTED. 
 
II.            
UDR’s Motion for Judgement on the Pleadings
 
“A
motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general
demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings
or by matters that can be judicially noticed. Presentation of extrinsic
evidence is therefore not proper on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.” (Cloud
v. Northrop Grumman Corp  (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 995, 999.)
 
A
motion for judgment on the pleadings is properly granted
when the “complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action against that defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd.
(c)(1)(B)(ii).) The grounds for the motion must appear on the face of the
challenged pleading or from matters that may be judicially noticed. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 438, subd. (d).) 
 
The
trial court must accept as true all material facts properly pleaded, but does
not consider conclusions of law or fact, opinions, speculation, or allegations
contrary to law or facts that are judicially noticed. (Stevenson Real Estate
Services, Inc. v. CB Richard Ellis Real Estate Services, Inc. (2006) 138
Cal.App.4th 1215, 1219–1220.)
 
UDR’s
Motion for Judgement on the Pleadings (“MJOP”) is entirely based on Gillete’s deemed
admitted RFAs. (See MJOP, pp. 5–9.) Due to the Court’s granting of Gillete’s
Motion to Set aside the Deemed Admitted RFAs and Amend the RFAs, Defendant has
no basis, nor any existing arguments, for the Court to grant the MJOP. Thus,
UDR’s MJOP is DENIED.
