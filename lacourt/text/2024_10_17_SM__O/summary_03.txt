Summary:

The judge issues a tentative ruling denying Overland's motion for sanctions against Kouyoumjian for filing a frivolous cross-complaint. The judge finds that the cross-complaint is not frivolous and that Kouyoumjian has a valid claim for malpractice against Overland. The judge concludes that the law requires that a plaintiff in a legal malpractice action must plead and prove actual innocence, and that Kouyoumjian's failure to allege actual innocence and exoneration of his prior convictions does not necessarily mean that his claim is frivolous. The judge also finds that sanctions under CCP 128.7 should only be utilized in rare and exceptional cases where the action is clearly frivolous, legally unreasonable or without legal foundation, or brought for an improper purpose.
