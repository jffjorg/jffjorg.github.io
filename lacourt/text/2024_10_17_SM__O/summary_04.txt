And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages. The plaintiff has alleged that the defendants engaged in fraudulent concealment and oppression, and that they failed to disclose material facts about the condition of the property before the plaintiff rented it. The judge finds that the plaintiff has pleaded sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages, and that the defendants' argument that the plaintiff's allegations are not specific enough is unpersuasive. The judge also finds that the defendants' argument that the plaintiff's reliance on their alleged concealment is not sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages is also unpersuasive. The judge notes that the plaintiff has alleged that she suffered substantial damages as a result of the defendants' conduct, and that she has pleaded all the necessary facts to support a claim for punitive damages.
