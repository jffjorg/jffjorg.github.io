And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Specially Appearing Defendants' motion to quash service of summons is granted. The Plaintiff failed to show that the summons and complaint were properly served on the defendants. Service of the summons and complaint solely by certified mail with a return receipt is not proper service on these defendants, as they did not agree to accept service by mail or execute an acknowledgment of receipt. The Plaintiff also failed to establish substitute service or properly serve the defendants by mail. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has not met its burden to establish the existence of jurisdiction over the defendants.
