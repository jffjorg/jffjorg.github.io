 Case Number:  24SMCV03160    Hearing Date:   October 17, 2024    Dept:  O   Case Name:   Scovell v. City of Santa Monica    Case No.:                    24SMCV03160   Complaint Filed:                   6-28-24      Hearing Date:            10-17-24   Discovery C/O:                     None     Calendar No.:            10   Discover Motion C/O:          None     POS:                           OK   Trial Date:                             None     SUBJECT:                 MOTION TO QUASH SERVICE OF  SUMMONS MOVING  PARTY:   Specially Appearing  Defendants Dustin Braschi, Jenna Grigsby, Santa Monica Police Department, City  Of Santa Monica  RESP.  PARTY:         Plaintiff Philice  Scovell   TENTATIVE  RULING             Specially  Appearing Defendants Dustin Braschi, Jenna Grigsby, Santa Monica Police  Department, and City Of Santa Monicas’ Motion to Quash Service of Summons is GRANTED.   Plaintiff has failed to show the summons and complaint have  been properly served on any of the defendants.  Service of the summons and complaint solely by  certified mail with a return receipt is not proper service on these defendants.  None of the defendants have agreed to accept service by mail, nor have they executed  any acknowledgment of receipt of the summons and complaint under Code of Civil  Procedure §415.30.                 REASONING              It is always the  plaintiff’s burden to establish the existence of jurisdiction.  (See Strathvale Holdings v. E.B.H.  (2005) 126 Cl.App.4th 1241, 1249.)   However, a properly executed proof of service gives rise to a  rebuttable presumption of proper personal service.  (See Dill v. Berquist Const. Co., Inc. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1441-1442.)               The Code of Civil Procedure  authorizes the Court to quash the service of a summons and complaint due to  lack of personal jurisdiction.   (a)  A defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within  any further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a  notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes: (1) To quash  service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him  or her. Cal.  Code Civ. Proc. 418.10.   There are five separate methods to effect  service within the Code of Civil procedure including:   (1) The  traditional method of personal delivery (Section 415.10). (2) Delivery of process  to a specified person usually at a defendant's abode or place of business  (Section 415.20). (3) Delivery of process by ordinary first-class mail or  airmail with return acknowledgement of receipt (Section 415.30). (4) Delivery  of process by registered or certified airmail with return receipt (Section  415.40). (5) Service by publication (Section 415.50). Except for delivery by  registered or certified mail, these methods may be used to effectuate service  either within or outside this state. (Section 413.10.) Service by registered or  certified airmail may be used to effectuate service only on a person outside  this state. (Section 415.40.)   (Code Civ.  Proc., § 415.10, judicial council comment.)   A summons may be served by personal delivery of a copy of the summons and  of the complaint to the person to be served. Service of a summons in this  manner is deemed complete at the time of such delivery. (Code Civ. Proc., §  415.10.)               Regarding Substitute Service, California  Code of Civil Procedure §415.20(b) provides:   If a copy of  the summons and complaint cannot with reasonable diligence be personally  delivered to the person to be served, as specified in Section 416.60, 416.70,  416.80, or 416.90, a summons may be served by leaving a copy of the summons and  complaint at the person's dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of  business, or usual mailing address other than a United States Postal Service  post office box, in the presence of a competent member of the household or a  person apparently in charge of his or her office, place of business, or usual  mailing address other than a United States Postal Service post office box, at  least 18 years of age, who shall be informed of the contents thereof, and by  thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and of the complaint by first-class  mail, postage prepaid to the person to be served at the place where a copy of  the summons and complaint were left. Service of a summons in this manner is  deemed complete on the 10th day after the mailing.   (Code Civ.  Proc., § 415.20, emphasis added.)   “[A]n  individual may be served by substitute service only after a good faith effort  at personal service has first been made: the burden is on the plaintiff to show  that the summons and complaint cannot with reasonable diligence be personally  delivered to the individual defendant . . . . [with] [t]wo or three attempts to  personally serve a defendant at a proper place ordinarily qualif[ying] as  reasonable diligence.” (American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011)  199 Cal.App.4th 383, 389.)               Specially Appearing Defendants Dustin  Braschi, Jenna Grigsby, Santa Monica Police Department, City Of Santa Monica  (“Defendants”) rebut any presumption of  proper personal service.  In her 8-16-24  opposition, Plaintiff Philice Scovell (“Scovell”) states ““On or about July 10th, 2024 paperwork was resubmitted and filed  with the courts and than [sic] e-filed electronically to serve all defendants  through electronic service once all papers were approved by clerk.” (8-16-24 Oppo.,  p. 2.) Defendants did not agree or consent to personal service via email, and  thus personal service was not properly effected. (See Grigsby Decl., ¶ 3;  Braschi Decl., ¶ 3; Seeman Decl., ¶ 4; Motta Decl., ¶ 5; Ford Decl., ¶ 5.)                Defendants establish that Scovell  failed to effect substitute service. Scovell failed to identify when the  substitute service was purportedly completed, where or how the papers were  delivered, she did not attach a declaration of diligence regarding attempts at  personal service, and did not certify that she mailed the papers after leaving  them at the Defendants’ office or home. (See 8-28-24 Proof of Service by Mail.)  Thus, Scovell failed to establish substitute service pursuant to CCP  § 415.20.                Additionally, Defendants establish  that Scovell failed to properly effect service by mail pursuant to CCP § 415.30.  CCP § 415.30 provides “[a] copy of the summons and of the complaint shall be  mailed (by first-class mail or airmail, postage prepaid) to the person to be  served, together with two copies of the notice and acknowledgment provided for  in subdivision (b) and a return envelope, postage prepaid, addressed to the  sender . . . . Service of a summons pursuant to this section is deemed complete  on the date a written acknowledgment of receipt of summons is executed, if such  acknowledgment thereafter is returned to the sender.” (Code Civ. Proc., §  415.30, subd. (a), (c).) Defendants declare that they did not sign or return an  acknowledgment of receipt to Scovelli. (See Grigsby Decl., ¶ 3; Braschi Decl.,  ¶ 3; Seeman Decl., ¶ 3; Ford Decl., ¶ 4.)
