English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Coachways' motion for leave to file cross-complaints against Transit Systems in four separate actions. Coachways seeks indemnification from Transit Systems for the same bus accident that injured multiple plaintiffs. The judge found that the proposed cross-complaints are compulsory and therefore must be granted if Coachways acted in good faith. The judge concluded that Coachways acted in good faith, as there was no evidence of bad faith or ill will in bringing the motion. The judge also rejected Transit Systems' arguments that the motion was untimely, that the proposed cross-complaints were permissive, and that the Certificate of Liability Insurance undermined Coachways' grounds for indemnity. The motion is granted, and Coachways must file the cross-complaints within 15 days.
