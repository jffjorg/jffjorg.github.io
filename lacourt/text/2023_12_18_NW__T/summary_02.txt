Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's demand for a jury trial. The court believes that the right to a jury trial is a fundamental constitutional right that should be protected, even in the absence of a trial date. The court notes that the defendants have only recently answered the complaint, and there is no prejudice to them in having a jury trial. On the other hand, the court believes that the plaintiff would be prejudiced if a jury trial were not granted. The court also points out that the moving papers were not properly served on the plaintiff's current counsel of record, and that the defendants have ignored this issue in their reply. Therefore, the court finds it would be an abuse of discretion to grant the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's right to a jury trial.
