And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to a motion to transfer venue. The judge is frustrated that the parties have not taken the simple step of identifying the actual county where the property is located, despite the availability of public resources such as property tax rolls and maps. The judge has directed the parties to identify the county and will consider transferring the venue if the property is found to be in Ventura County, but plaintiff will be responsible for the transfer fees in both counties.
