 Case Number:  22VECV01240    Hearing Date:   December 18, 2023    Dept:  T 22VECV01240
Soto v Puretek
Tentative
ruling on ex parte application to continue trial and special set motion:  Defer until hearing.  The court will want to know when did
defendant first request a deposition of plaintiff, when did defendant first
serve a deposition notice for plaintiff, why no motion to compel the deposition
of the plaintiff was made in a timely manner, what specific discovery needs to
be completed, why it wasn’t done earlier. 
Concerning the MSJ, why has no motion been filed?  Puretek answered the complaint one year ago,
why has discovery been delayed?
