And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the defendant's demurrer to the complaint with 20 days leave to amend as to the eighth cause of action (breach of contract), but overrules the demurrer as to the remaining nine causes of action. The Judge finds that the complaint sufficiently pleads factual allegations to support all causes of action except for breach of contract against the defendant. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's allegation that the defendant owned, operated, and managed the property is contradicted by the attached lease, which identifies the lessor/landlord/contracting party/signatory as Zina Tehrani c/o Reza Tak. The Judge concludes that the facts in the attached lease take precedence over the plaintiff's allegations, but finds that the plaintiff's allegations of operator and manager are not conclusory and present grounds to hold the defendant liable for failures in maintaining the property. The Judge grants the defendant leave to amend the complaint to cure the pleading defect, but not to add new causes of action.
