 Case Number:  22STCV26908    Hearing Date:   December 18, 2023    Dept:  T 22STCV26908
Fouad v Jones & Jones
Tentative ruling:
Motion to transfer venue.  The court does
not understand why the parties have not determined what county this property is
actually in.  There are a multitude of
public sites to determine whether this property is in Ventura County or Los
Angeles County.  Unfortunately, the 91361
zip code straddles two counties.  Accordingly,
it should be simple to check the property tax rolls or an accurate map showing
the county borders to calculate location. 
The court is not going to transfer venue for convenience but if this
property is in Ventura County, it will be transferred, and plaintiff will be
responsible for transfer fees in both counties.
YOU ARE
DIRECTED TO IDENTIFY THE ACTUAL COUNTY IN WHICH THIS PROPERTY IS SITUATED.
