(Calima) as a cross-defendant and to add causes of action related to Calima's alleged unlicensed contractor status during the Rolling Greens project. The court has granted the motion, finding that THG has shown that the proposed amendment is timely and necessary to correct a mistake in the name of a party. The court notes that Calima has not shown any prejudice from the proposed amendment, and that the policy is to favor amendments in furtherance of justice. The court also points out that Calima has not provided any case law demonstrating that the short delay from March 2024 to May 2024 would cause prejudice.
