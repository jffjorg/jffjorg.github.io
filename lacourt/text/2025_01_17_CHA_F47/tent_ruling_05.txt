SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
On 4/20/23, Plaintiff Gary Grant (Plaintiff) filed this
action against Defendant One876 Caribbean Restaurant, LLC (Defendant) for: (1)
Failure to Provide Required Mean Periods (Labor Code 226.7, 510, 512, 1194,
1197; IWC Wage Orders); (2) Failure to Provide Required Rest Periods (Labor
Code 226.7, 512; IWC Wage Orders); (3) Failure to Pay Overtime Wages (Labor
Code 510, 1194, 1198; IWC Wage Orders); (4) Failure to Pay Minimum Wages (Labor
Code 1194, 1197; IWC Wage Orders); (5) Failure to Timely Pay Wages During
Employment (Labor Code 204); (6) Failure to Pay All Wages Due to Discharged and
Quitting Employees (Labor Code 201, 202, 203); (7) Failure to Maintain Required
Records (Labor Code 226, 1174; IWC Wage Orders); (8) Failure to Furnish
Accurate, Itemized Wage Statements (Labor Code 226; IWC Wage Orders) and (9)
Unfair and Unlawful Business Practices.  
 
After Defendant failed to respond to the complaint,
default was entered against Defendant on 6/14/23.  Thereafter, on 7/25/23, the Court entered
default judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of
$26,371.85.
 
Plaintiff contends that Defendant misled Plaintiff to
believe he was employed by Defendant when Plaintiff was actually employed by
McFarlane Girls, Inc.  Plaintiff contends
that during his workers compensation filing against Defendant after the default
judgment, he discovered that Defendant was a mere shell to cover up McFarlane
Girls, Inc. (the Alter Ego Entity) which Plaintiff claims holds the assets and
liabilities for the business that employed Plaintiff.  (Idrees Decl.).
 
Plaintiff contends that there was no active entity that
existed at the inception of Plaintiff’s employment.  Rather, Defendant, while bearing the same name
as the restaurant Plaintiff was employed in, did not exist as an entity until 11/3/21,
which occurred after Plaintiff was already employed.  (Idrees Decl. ¶4, Ex.B).  Plaintiff contends the Alter Ego Entity was
not registered as an active entity with the California Secretary of State until
filing the first Statement of Information on 12/22/22.  (Id. ¶5, Ex.C).
 
Plaintiff notes that Defendant and Alter Ego Entity both
have their principal and mailing address registered to 20869 Lassen Street,
Chatsworth, CA 91311 – the address where One876 Caribbean Restaurant operates.  (Id. ¶6).  Additionally, the owner of both Alter Ego
Entity and Defendant, Trudy Gray, is also listed as the agent for service of
process under both Alter Ego Entity and Defendant.  Id.  Defendant and Alter Ego Entity are both listed
as a “Restaurant” business.  (Id. 
¶7, Ex.D).  Public
records also show Alter Ego Entity is recognized as the entity that operates
One876 Caribbean Restaurant and have their business phone number registered as
(818) 678-9252, which is the phone number for store operations of One876
Caribbean Restaurant. (Id. ¶8, Ex.E).
 
On 11/17/23, Plaintiff filed his first motion seeking an
order amending the Default Judgment entered on 7/25/23 to add McFarlane Girls,
Inc. as an alter ego judgment debtor pursuant to CCP 187.  That motion was placed off calendar due to
service issues.  (See 5/1/24
Minute Order).    
 
On 5/6/24, Plaintiff filed the instant motion which seeks
the same relief.  On 5/30/24, Plaintiff  filed a proof of service indicating that
Trudy Gray, the owner of Defendant and Alter Ego Entity, was served with the
motion via substituted service on 5/23/24 with subsequent mailing occurring on 5/29/24.  (See 5/30/24 Proof of Service).
 
No opposition or other response to the motion has been
filed.      
 
ANALYSIS
 
The Court has the authority to amend its judgment to add
a non-party alter ego judgment debtor, such as McFarlane Girls, Inc/the Alter
Ego Entity.  See Dow Jones Co.
(1984) 151 CA3d 144, 148-149; Greenspan (2010) 191 CA4th 486, 508; Hall,
Goodhue, Haisley & Barker, Inc. (1996) 41 CA4th 1551, 1554-1555; Misik
(2011) 197 CA4th 1065, 1074-1075; CCP 187; CCP 989.
 
Such an amendment to a judgment merely sets forth the
true name of the defendant and does not add a new defendant.  Misik, supra at 1072; Triplett
(1994) 24 CA4th 1415, 1420; Tokio Marine & Fire Insurance Corp.
(1999) 75 CA4th 110, 116. 
 
When determining a motion to add a judgment debtor,
courts look for a “unity of interest” between the entities to ensure the alter
ego’s interests were adequately represented in the litigation.  See Relentless Air Racing, LLC
(2013) 222 CA4th 811, 816; NEC Electronics, Inc. v (1989) 208 CA3d 772,
780-781.  Such an amendment is even allowed
when the judgment creditor knew of an alter ego relationship before judgment is
entered, if the interests of the alter ego and judgment debtor are identical.  Relentless Air Racing, LLC, supra;
NEC Electronics, Inc., supra. 

 
Here, after Plaintiff obtained a default judgment against
Defendant, Plaintiff learned that Defendant misled him to believe the Alter Ego
Entity was not his employer and continued to operate the business under the
name of the Alter Ego Entity.  (See
Idrees Decl. and exhibits attached thereto). 
Plaintiff has shown that publicly available information establishes that
Defendant and the Alter Ego Entity share a unity of interest such that the
Alter Ego Entity’s interests were adequately represented.  As noted above, Plaintiff has uncovered evidence
that shows that Defendant and Alter Ego Entity, have the same business and
principal address listed on the California Secretary of State website: 20869
Lassen Street, Chatsworth, CA, 91311.  The
principal and business address listed for Alter Ego Entity is the exact address
that Plaintiff was employed at when employed by Defendant.  Defendant and Alter Ego Entity have the same
phone number.  Further, both Defendant
and Alter Ego Entity have the same owner and agent for service of process:
Trudy Gray, 20869 Lassen Street, Chatsworth, CA 91311.  Further, in the workers compensation case
filed by Plaintiff, Alter Ego Entity was listed as the insured-employer, while
Defendant represented to Plaintiff that the Alter Ego Entity was not the
employer.
 
Such evidence is sufficient to support amending the
judgment to add the Alter Ego Entity as a judgment debtor.  See Toho-Towa Co., Ltd. (2013)
217 CA4th 1096, 1105.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted.
