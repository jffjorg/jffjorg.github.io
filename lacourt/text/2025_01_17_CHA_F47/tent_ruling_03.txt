Case #22CHCV01116
 
MOTION TO
CONTINUE TRIAL 
 
Motion filed on 12/18/24.
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendants Jason and Andrea McCune
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiffs Anderson and Rosie Boyce
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order continuing the 1/27/25 trial
date to the Court’s next available date after 1/31/25.
 
RULING: The motion is granted.   
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
The action arises out of a dispute between owners and/or
former owners of neighboring properties regarding trees that run/ran along the
border of the adjacent properties. 
Plaintiffs Anderson and Rosie Boyce sued former owners of the
neighboring property, Jason and Andrea McCune, and current owner Jessica
Skinfield (in default).  
 
Trial was originally scheduled for 10/21/24 and on
10/14/24 continued by the Court to 12/9/24.
At the 12/2/24 FSC, the Court continued the trial date to
1/27/25 due to a conflict in the Court’s calendar.  After the trial was set for 1/27/25, the
McCunes’ counsel learned that both Jason and Andrea McCune are unavailable that
week due to conflicts with their work schedules.  (See Jason McCune Decl.; Andrea McCune
Decl.).  Neither of the prior
continuances were the fault of Plaintiffs or the McCunes.  
 
On 12/18/24, the McCunes filed and served the instant
motion seeking an order continuing the 1/27/25 trial date to the Court’s next
available date after 1/31/25.  Plaintiffs
have filed a partial opposition to the motion. 
No reply has been filed.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
The Court finds that the McCunes have shown good cause
for a continuance of the trial date based on their unavailability on the
current trial date.  See CRC
3.1332(c)(2), (d).  Additionally, Plaintiffs
do not oppose a one to two week continuance of the trial date.  Plaintiffs request that the Court continue
the trial date to the first available date and in no event longer than two
months.  Plaintiffs indicate that if the
trial is going to be continued for multiple months, they reserve the right to
later oppose the motion.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
The trial date will be continued to the Court’s next available date
after 1/31/25.
