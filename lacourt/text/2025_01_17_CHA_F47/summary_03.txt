And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion filed by the defendants, Jason and Andrea McCune, to continue the trial date from January 27, 2025, to the court's next available date after January 31, 2025. The motion was filed on December 18, 2024, due to the defendants' unavailability on the current trial date due to work schedule conflicts. The plaintiffs, Anderson and Rosie Boyce, do not oppose a one to two week continuance of the trial date. The judge finds that the defendants have shown good cause for a continuance of the trial date and grants the motion.
