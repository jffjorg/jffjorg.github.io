SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
 
This action arises out of an automobile accident that
occurred on 11/13/20.  Plaintiffs Brian
Avalos, Eva Sanchez Avalos and Alejandra Jimenez (collectively, Plaintiffs)
allege that Defendant Eddie Camargo caused the accident which resulted in
Plaintiffs suffering personal injuries and property damage to Plaintiff Eva
Sanchez Avalos. Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Ruth Pelayo aka Ruth Vazquez
aka Ruth Camargo (Ruth Pelayo) is one of or the only owner of the vehicle
driven by Eddie Camargo and involved in the accident on 11/13/20. 
 
On 11/8/22, Plaintiffs filed this action against Eddie
Camargo and Ruth Pelayo for: (1) General Negligence (against Eddie Camargo),
(2) Motor Vehicle Negligence (against Eddie Camargo), (3) Negligent Infliction
of Emotional Distress (against Eddie Camargo), (4) Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress (against Eddie Camargo), (5) Permissive Use Statute Claim
(Vehicle Code Section 17149) (against Ruth Pelayo), and (6) Negligent
Entrustment (against Ruth Pelayo). 
Plaintiffs have since dismissed the 4th cause of action for
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.
 
On 12/14/23, Plaintiff Eva Sanchez Avalos served Defendant
Eddie Camargo with Form Interrogatories, Set 1. 
(O’Hara Decl., Ex.A).  On 1/16/24,  Eddie Camargo served responses and objections
to the discovery requests without verification. 
(Id., Ex.B, C).  Counsel
for the parties met and conferred regarding the discovery responses.  (Id., Ex.C).
 
On 2/26/24, the parties stipulated to continue the then
8/19/24 trial date. Within that stipulation, it was stated that Defendants
intended to serve verifications and further responses to five sets of written
discovery propounded by Plaintiffs.  As a
result, the Court ordered the trial date continued to 2/24/25 and ordered the
discovery deadlines and cut-offs to correspond to the new trial date. (See
2/26/24 Stipulation & Order). 
Despite further meet and confer efforts, neither further responses nor a
verification have been served.  (O’Hara
Decl., Ex.C, F).  Thereafter, pursuant to
Plaintiffs’ motion, the trial date was continued to 8/25/25.  (See 9/11/24 Minute Order).
 
As of the filing of the motion, neither further responses
nor a verification had been served regarding the subject discovery.  (O’Hara Decl.).  Therefore, on 5/20/24, Plaintiff Eva Sanchez  Avalos filed and served the instant motion
seeking an order compelling Defendant Eddie Camargo to serve a verification and
further responses to Plaintiff Eva Sanchez Avalos’ Form Interrogatories, Set 1,
Form Interrogatories 2.6, 2.7, 12.4, 12.6, 15.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.4, 16.5, 16.6,
16.9, 16.10, 20.2, 20.3, 20.4, 20.5, 20.6, 20.7, 20.8, 20.9, 20.10, and 20.11.  Additionally, Plaintiff Eva Sanchez Avalos
requests sanctions be imposed against Defendant Eddie Camargo and defense
counsel, Khelya M. Okunor, jointly and severally, in the amount of $2,660.00.  On 12/2/24, Defendant Eddie Camargo filed and
served an opposition to the motion and on 12/5/24, Plaintiff Eva Sanchez Avalos
filed and served a reply to the opposition. 
  
 
On 1/6/25 at 12:00 a.m., Plaintiffs’ counsel filed a
declaration in response to Defendant Eddie Camargo’s Further Responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set 1.  On 1/6/25 at
10:32 p.m., Defendants’ counsel filed a declaration re: compliance with
Plaintiffs’ motion to compel discovery response.   
 
ANALYSIS
 
The broad scope of discovery allows a party to “obtain
discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject
matter involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion
made in that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or
appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence.”  CCP 2017.010.
 
CCP 2030.300(a) provides:
 
“(a) On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the
propounding party deems that any of the following apply:
(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete.
(2) An exercise of the option to produce documents
under Section
2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those
documents is inadequate.
(3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or
too general.”
 
Since the subject responses include facts and objections
and no verification had been served, the 45-day limit to bring the motion never
began to run.  See Golf &
Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. (2022) 84 CA5th 127, 134-136; CCP 2030.300(c).  To the extent the responses included facts
which needed a verification which was never provided, they are the equivalent
to no response.  See Appleton
(1988) 206 CA3d 632, 635-636.
 
If a timely motion to compel further responses is filed,
the responding party has the burden of justifying any objection.  Fairmont Insurance Co. (2000) 22 C4th
245, 255; Coy (1962) 58 C2d 210, 220-221; Williams  (2017) 3 C5th 531, 541-542.  
 
The interrogatories seek information relevant to the
issues in this case.  Eddie Camargo has
failed to justify the objections included in his original responses and the
factual information in those  responses
was not verified, inadequate and/or evasive. 
However, the declaration of Plaintiffs’ counsel filed on 1/6/24 concedes
that Eddie Camargo served further responses to the subject Form Interrogatories
on 12/26/24 rendering the request to compel further responses moot and
Defendants’ counsel’s declaration, also filed on 1/6/24, indicates that
additional further responses were served on 1/6/25.  To the extent that Plaintiff Eva Sanchez
Avalos is not satisfied with any of those further responses, she must meet and
confer in an attempt to informally resolve the discovery disputes before filing
a motion which specifically addresses those further responses along with a
separate statement which complies with the requirements of CRC 3.1345(c).  See CCP 2030.300(b)(1); (See
below re: Separate Statement).  
 
The imposition of sanctions is warranted against Eddie
Camargo and his former attorney, Khelya M. Okunor, for their failure to comply
with their discovery obligations.  CCP
2030.300(d).  The Court finds the
$2,660.00 requested to be reasonable under the circumstances.  (See O’Hara Decl., p.8:7-14).   As such, sanctions in the amount of
$2,660.00 are imposed jointly and severally on Eddie Camargo and his former
attorney, Khelya M. Okunor, in favor of Plaintiffs’ counsel, Colleen O’Hara.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The Court finds the request to compel further responses
is moot.  Sanctions are imposed against
Defendant Eddie Camargo and his former attorney, Khelya M. Okunor, in favor of
Plaintiffs’ counsel, Colleen O’Hara, in the amount of $2,660.00, payable within
30 days.
 
The Court notes that Plaintiffs’ counsel has failed to
electronically bookmark the exhibits submitted in support of the motion in
violation of CRC 3.1110(f)(4).  Counsel
for the parties are warned that failure to comply with this rule in the future
may result in matters being continued so that papers can be re-filed in
compliance with the rule, papers not being considered and/or the imposition of
sanctions. 
 
Additionally, the Court notes that the separate statement
filed in support of the motion is not in the proper format.  CRC 3.1345(c) provides in relevant part:
 
“The separate statement must include--for each discovery
request (e.g., each interrogatory, request for admission, deposition question,
or inspection demand) to which a further response, answer, or production is
requested--the following:
(1) The text of the request, interrogatory, question, or
inspection demand;
(2) The text of each response, answer, or objection, and
any further responses or answers;
(3) A statement of the factual and legal reasons for
compelling further responses, answers, or production as to each matter in
dispute;
(4) If necessary, the text of all definitions,
instructions, and other matters required to understand each discovery request
and the responses to it;
(5) If the response to a particular discovery request is
dependent on the response given to another discovery request, or if the reasons
a further response to a particular discovery request is deemed necessary are
based on the response to some other discovery request, the other request and
the response to it must be set forth; and
(6) If the pleadings, other documents in the file, or
other items of discovery are relevant to the motion, the party relying on them
must summarize each relevant document.”
 
Here, the separate statement merely sets forth the
interrogatories and Eddie Camargo’s  responses to the interrogatories, verbatim,
and then reiterates, verbatim, the motion’s memorandum and points and
authorities.  In the future, counsel must
follow the format set forth in CRC 3.1345(c) by addressing each discovery
request individually and not including extraneous information/arguments (i.e.,
statement of facts, sanctions).
