And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the petition for approval of compromise and funding of a special needs trust (SNT) for Raul Cabrera, the plaintiff. The compromise was reached between the plaintiff and the defendants, GMCND, Inc. dba Placita Market, Sharmeen's Enterprises, Inc., and Shoukat Ali, Henry and Sara Rose (CA), LLC, Samuel F. Rose Properties, LLC, and Rose Brothers Enterprises.

The settlement provides for the payment of $500,000 to GMCND, Inc. dba Placita Market, Sharmeen's Enterprises, Inc., and Shoukat Ali, and $150,000 to Henry and Sara Rose (CA), LLC, Samuel F. Rose Properties, LLC, and Rose Brothers Enterprises. The plaintiff will receive $217,433.00, which will be invested in a single-premium annuity and transferred to a Special Needs Trust (SNT) for the benefit of the plaintiff.

The judge requires the filing of a Notice of Commencement of Proceedings for a Court Supervised Trust in the Probate division of this court within 60 days. The judge also sets an OSC in its own department in approximately 60 days to ensure the funding of the settlement, submission of bond, and the filing of LASC Form PRO 044 to open a trust supervision action in probate.

The judge makes the following findings when approving the establishment or funding of a SNT: the SNT beneficiary has a disability that substantially impairs the individual's ability to provide for their own care or custody and constitutes a substantial handicap; the SNT beneficiary is likely to have special needs that will not be met without the trust; and the money to be paid to the trust does not exceed the amount that appears reasonably necessary to meet the SNT beneficiary's special needs.
