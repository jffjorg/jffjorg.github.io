PLAINTIFF:       

 

Raul Cabrera, age 58, person with a disability

 

PETITIONER:   

 

Melanie Cabrera (Appointed 10/27/21)

 




 

GROSS AND NET SETTLEMENT (Petition, p. 6, sections 15 and
16f):           

 

Gross $650,000, Net $217,433

 

PROPOSED RECIPIENT OF SETTLEMENT PROCEEDS (Petition, pp. 8-9, sec.
18):

 

Petitioner proposes to fund $67,433 cash into a SNT for the
benefit of plaintiff and to use the remaining $150,000 to purchase an annuity
that would pay into the SNT under the following terms:

 

Commencing 05/01/2025, $5,122.24 per
month for 2 years and 6 months, guaranteed; (final guaranteed payment on
10/01/2027).

 

(Annuity documents at court’s pdf, p. 43.)  

 

An SNT is used to receive the settlement funds in these situations
so that plaintiff does not lose benefits eligibility for Medi-Cal, SSI, and
other benefits.  Historically, a person
receiving Medi-Cal or SSI benefits could have only up to $2,000 in non-exempt
assets, and any additional non-exempt assets over $2,000 would cause the loss
of benefits eligibility under the relevant federal and state law.  Funds held in a valid SNT, however, are
exempt assets that do not count toward the $2,000 asset limit for purposes of
calculating benefits eligibility.  On
January 1, 2024, the Medi-Cal asset qualification limit was eliminated and
there is no longer a means test for Medi-Cal. 
The income qualifications, and the asset qualification for other
benefits, like SSI, did not change and therefore there might remain a reason
for creation and funding of a SNT to maintain other benefits.

 

BRIEFING REGARDING TRUST ISSUES:

 

Petitioner provides briefing regarding trust issue at Attachment
18b(4), court’s pdf at p. 53.

 

PROPOSED TRUST INSTRUMENT:

 

Petitioner provides the proposed trust instrument at Exhibit A to
Attachment 18b(4), court’s pdf at p. 63.

 

The main requirements for court created or funded trusts are set
forth at California Rules of Court (CRC) rule 7.903(c) and LASC rule
4.116(b).  The proposed trust
instrument meets those requirements and is approved for creation and funding.

 

FINDINGS WHEN THE PROPOSED TRUST IS AN SNT:

 

When approving the establishment or funding of a SNT from
settlement proceeds, the court must make the following findings pursuant to
Probate Code section 3604(b).  There are
factual allegations in the Petition to Approve Compromise and its attachments
supporting the settlement that generally cover the requisite findings and the
court therefore makes these findings:

 


The SNT beneficiary has a
     disability which substantially impairs the individual’s ability to provide
     for her own care or custody and constitutes a substantial handicap;
The SNT beneficiary is likely to
     have special needs that will not be met without the trust; 
The money to be paid to the trust
     does not exceed the amount that appears reasonably necessary to meet the
     SNT beneficiary’s special needs.


 

TRUSTE AND BOND:

 

The proposed initial trustee is petitioner,
Melanie Cabrera.  Normally, bond must be
required of a trustee unless the trustee is a corporate fiduciary.  (California Rules of Court, Rule 7.903(c)(5),
Probate Code section 2320.)  The
proposed trustee does not meet that requirement and the court requires bond.  

 

In the briefing, petitioner calculates $121,477.30 bond (rounded
up to $121,500 in the submitted proposed order) based upon the assets to be
funded into the trust, plus anticipated annual income from investments and any
annuity, plus an additional amount required for the costs of any recovery on
the bond.  That calculation appears to
be proper and the court requires $121,500 bond to be submitted by trustee to
this department (which will later be resubmitted to the Probate court in any
trust supervision action).     

 

ORDERS/PROPOSED ORDER:

 

Proposed Order received stamp date:  11/15/25

General trust orders at Attachment 8b(2),
order pdf, p. 6.

When the petition is approved, this
court requires the filing of a Notice of Commencement of Proceedings for a
Court Supervised Trust on LASC Form PRO 044 in the Probate division of this
court within 60 days.  It is this filing
that will pass jurisdiction over the trust to the Probate division of this
court to provide for court supervision of the trust over the years.  It is in that Probate case that accountings
will be filed periodically by trustee, as well as any other petitions involving
the trust.  The proposed order
sufficiently includes this language. 
Okay.    

When the petition is approved, this
court also orders that the trustee’s first accounting is due filed in the
Probate case within a year, and an actual 14 month calendar due date should be
stated.  It is that actual date that will
be picked up by the Probate filing window when the trust supervision action is
filed and an OSC/compliance date re the first accounting will be set.  The proposed order sufficiently includes
this language.  An actual 14 month due
date for the first accounting shall be inserted into the blank provided at
order pdf, p. 7, paragraph 9.  

When the petition is approved, this
court should also set an OSC in its own department in approximately 60 days to
ensure the funding of the settlement, submission of bond, and the filing of
LASC Form PRO 044 to open a trust supervision action in probate.  The proposed order sufficiently includes
this language.  Th date/time/department
for the OSC shall be inserted in the blanks provided at order pdf, p. 7,
paragraph 8.
