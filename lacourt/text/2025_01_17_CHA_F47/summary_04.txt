And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Deborah Lopez Nacisvalencia, has filed a motion to strike general damages from the complaint, but the judge has denied the motion. The judge found that the defendant did not provide any authority to support the relief requested, and even if they had, they failed to provide a justifiable reason for not seeking to strike the claim for general damages within the time limit set forth in CCP 435(b)(1). The judge also noted that a motion to strike would not have been the proper vehicle to address the defendant's contention that the plaintiff may not claim general damages in this action.
