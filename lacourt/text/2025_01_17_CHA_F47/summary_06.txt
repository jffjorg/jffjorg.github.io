And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motion filed by Plaintiff Miriam Avila Saucedo to compel the deposition of Defendant Nissan North America, Inc.'s Person Most Qualified (PMQ). The PMQ is ordered to appear and testify at the deposition on a date agreed upon by the parties. If the parties have already agreed on a date, the deposition is to proceed on that date. If not, counsel for the parties are ordered to meet and confer regarding a mutually agreeable date for the deposition to take place within the next 30 days.

The court also awards Plaintiff sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $1,000.00, which is payable within 30 days. The sanctions are justified because Defendant failed to offer deposition dates as promised and Plaintiff adequately met and conferred before filing the motion.

The court notes that Plaintiff's counsel failed to electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to the Wisniewski declaration, which violates CRC 3.1110(f)(4). Counsel for the parties are warned that failure to comply with this rule in the future may result in matters being continued, papers not being considered, or the imposition of sanctions.
