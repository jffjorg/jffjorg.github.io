RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Nissan North America, Inc.
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order compelling Defendant

RULING: The motion is granted as set forth below.
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Miriam Avila
Saucedo’s (Plaintiff) purchase of a Certified Pre-Owned 2020 Nissan Altima (the
Vehicle) on or about 5/1/21.  With the
purchase of the Vehicle, Plaintiff received written and other express and
implied warranties, including warranties from Defendant Nissan North America,
Inc. (Defendant).  
 
Since the purchase of the Vehicle Plaintiff has presented
it to Defendant and its authorized repair facilities on numerous occasions for
various problems resulting in the Vehicle being out of service for what
Plaintiff deems to be an unreasonable number of days.  
 
On 6/7/23, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendant
for breach of implied and express warranty under the Song-Beverly Warranty
Act.  On 7/25/24, Plaintiff noticed the
deposition of Defendant’s Person Most Qualified for 8/23/24.  (Wisniewski Decl.,
Ex.A).  On 8/16/24, Defendant objected to
the notice.  (Id., Ex.B).  On 8/16/24, Plaintiff sent a meet and confer
letter regarding scheduling the deposition and requesting dates for the
deposition.  (Id., Ex.C).  Defendant failed to respond.  (Wisniewski Decl.). 
 
On 10/22/24, Plaintiff sent a follow-up email.  (Wisniewski Decl., Ex.D).  On 10/24/24,   Defendant requested that Plaintiff be patient
until the week of 11/4/24 when counsel would likely have buyback authority and
dates of availability for the deposition. 
Id.  Defendant never further
responded regarding buyback authority or deposition dates.  (Wisniewski Decl.).
 
On 12/9/24, Plaintiff filed and served the instant motion
seeking an order compelling Defendant’s Person Most Qualified (PMQ) to appear
and testify at their properly noticed deposition and to produce documents at
deposition as specified in the deposition notice served on 7/25/24, which was
scheduled for 8/23/24 at 10:00 a.m. via Zoom video conference.  Additionally, Plaintiff requests an order
awarding Plaintiff sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $1,000.00.  Defendant has opposed the motion and Plaintiff
has filed a reply to the opposition.
 
ANALYSIS
 
There is no dispute that Plaintiff is entitled to take
the deposition of Defendant’s PMQ as the opposition indicates that it has
offered to produce and witness on a mutually agreed upon date.  The reply indicates that the parties have
agreed on a deposition date of 2/28/25; however, no evidence of such agreement
is provided (i.e., copies of the email communications, a declaration).  (See Reply, p.2:27-28).
 
As such, the only remaining issue in dispute is sanctions
against Defendant.  Contrary to
Defendant’s assertion, the Court finds that Plaintiff adequately met and
conferred before filing this motion and Defendant failed to offer deposition
dates as promised.  Therefore, Plaintiff
justifiably filed and served the instant motion.  Further, it appears that Defendant failed to offer
a deposition date until the date a reply was due regarding this motion.  
 
As such, sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against
Defendant in the amount of $1,000.00 (1 hour to prepare motion + 1.5 hours to
review opposition, prepare reply and appear multiplied by $400/hour) are
warranted.  CCP 2023.010(d), (i); CCP 2023.030(a);
CCP 2025.450(g)(1).
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
Defendant Nissan North America, Inc. is ordered to produce its Person(s)
Most Qualified for deposition on a date agreed upon by the parties.  If 2/28/25 has already been agreed upon, the
deposition is ordered to proceed on that date. 
If not, counsel for the parties are ordered to meet and confer regarding
a mutually agreeable date for the deposition to take place within the next 30
days and are ordered to inform the Court by 4:00 p.m. on Tuesday, 1/21/25, as
to that date.   
 
Sanctions are imposed on Defendant Nissan North America,
Inc. and in favor of Miriam Avila Saucedo in the amount of $1,000.00.  Sanctions are payable within 30 days.   
 
The Court notes that in violation of CRC 3.1110(f)(4), Plaintiff’s
counsel has failed to electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to the
Wisniewski declaration.  Counsel for the
parties are warned that failure to comply with this rule in the future may
result in matters being continued so that papers can be re-filed in compliance,
papers not being considered and/or the imposition of sanctions.
