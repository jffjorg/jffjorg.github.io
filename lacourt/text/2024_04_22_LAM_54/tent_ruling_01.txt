BACKGROUND
                
This is a lemon law action arising out
of the purchase of a 2022 Chevrolet Silverado manufactured and distributed by Defendant General Motors.

 
ANALYSIS
 
 
The Song-Beverly Act provides, “[i]f
the buyer prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed
by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate
amount of costs and expenses, including attorney's fees based on actual time
expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer
in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.” (Civ. Code
§ 1794(d).) 
 
Plaintiff asserts that the Consumer Law
Experts, PC incurred $37,125.05 in fees to prosecute this action. Plaintiff anticipates an additional
$4,000.00 in fees to review the opposition to the motion, draft a reply and
attend the hearing.
 
Plaintiff’s counsel charges between $210.00
and $500.00 per hour and spent 89.55 hours on this case over approximately two
years. In opposition, Defendant argues that counsel’s hours are unreasonable.
The Court does not find counsel’s billing entries excessive. None of the
entries cited by Defendant are so egregious to warrant being reduced. This
action lasted two years, involved motion work, and resulted in a favorable
settlement for Plaintiff. The Court finds that counsel’s fees are reasonable.
 
Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED in the
amount of $41,125.05.
