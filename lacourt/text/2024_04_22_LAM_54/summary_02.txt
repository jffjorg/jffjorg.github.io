And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Mercedes-Benz USA LLC, has moved to compel arbitration in this lemon law action arising from the plaintiff's purchase of a 2021 Mercedes-Benz S580. The defendant argues that the arbitration provision in the Retail Installment Sale Contract executed by the plaintiff on July 26, 2021, is enforceable, despite being a non-signatory to the agreement. The court finds that the defendant is not entitled to compel arbitration under the arbitration provision, citing the Second District Court of Appeal's opinion in Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023), which declined to follow the Third District Court of Appeal's opinion in Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020). Therefore, the defendant's motion to compel arbitration is denied.
