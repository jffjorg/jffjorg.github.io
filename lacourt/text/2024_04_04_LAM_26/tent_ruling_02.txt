[TENTATIVE] order RE:
DEFENDANTS GLORIA LOPEZ AND JULIE C.
  LIm’s MOTION TO TAX COSTS
 
 



 
Procedural Background
            On February 19, 2016, Plaintiff
Robert Scott Shtofman ("Plaintiff") filed this case. On June 24,
2021, Plaintiff entered into a Settlement Agreement with Defendant Arch
Insurance Group, Inc. The Settlement Agreement provided that Plaintiff was to
and did receive a gross amount of $103,000 from Defendant Arch Insurance Group,
Inc. On October 19, 2022, trial began with the remaining Defendants. On
November 4, 2022, the jury in the above-entitled matter rendered their
respective verdicts. Defendant Gloria Lopez prevailed in full as against the
Plaintiff. The jury rendered a damages verdict as against Defendant Julie C.
Lim ("Lim") in the amount of more than $200,000 plus punitive
damages.
On
November 21, 2022, Defendant Julie C. Lim moved the court for an offset credit
of the $103,000 settlement amount, received by Plaintiff. 
On
August 25, 2023, Plaintiff Shtofman filed a proposed Judgment. On the same day
Plaintiff Shtofman filed his Memorandum of Costs.
            On September 11, 2023, Defendants
Gloria Lopez and Julie C. Lim filed the instant motion to tax costs.  On March 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
opposition.  As of April 4, 2024, Defendants
have not filed a reply. 
 
Legal Standard
“A prevailing party is entitled ‘as a
matter of right’ to recover costs in any action or proceeding unless a statute
expressly provides otherwise.”  (Segal
v. ASICS America Corp. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 651, 658.)  “Section 1033.5 sets forth the types of
expenses that are and are not allowable as costs under section 1032.
Specifically, subdivision (a) of section 1033.5 describes items that are ‘allowable
as costs,’ subdivision (b) describes items ‘not allowable as costs, except when
expressly authorized by law,’ and section 1033.5(c)(4) provides that ‘[i]tems
not mentioned in this section and items assessed upon application may be
allowed or denied in the court's discretion.’” 
(Ibid.)
To recover a cost, it must be reasonably
necessary to the litigation and reasonable in amount. (Perko’s Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS Enterprises (l992) 4 Cal.App.4th
238, 244.) If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges,
the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not
reasonable or necessary. (Ladas v.
California State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-74.)  On the other hand, if the items are properly
objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party
claiming them as costs. (Id.)  
California Rule of Court, Rule 3.1700
requires that “[a]ny notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be served
and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum. If the cost memorandum
was served by mail, the period is extended” by up to 20 days. (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1700(b)(1).) Additionally, “[T]he court may extend the times for
serving and filing the cost memorandum or the notice of motion or tax costs for
a period not to exceed 30 days.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700(b)(3).)  
Discussion
            Defendants Gloria Lopez and Julie C.
Lim argue that good cause exists for making the instant motion because no
judgment has been entered, the motion is not ripe, and the memorandum of costs seeks
costs which were incurred as to third parties, who mutually waived their costs
during settlement. Defendants also argue that Plaintiff's Memorandum of Costs
"cannot be reconciled", given the settlements with Arch Insurance
Company and Alliance United Insurance Company. 
“It
is not necessary that the [moving party], …, accompany the motion to tax cost
with any affidavit.”  (State of
California v. Meyer (1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 1061, 1075.)  Rather, “[i]f items on a memorandum of costs
appear to be proper charges on their face, those items are prima facie evidence
that the costs, expenses, and services are proper and necessarily incurred.
[Citation.] The burden then shifts to the objecting party to show them to be
unnecessary or unreasonable.”  (Doe v.
Los Angeles County Dept. of Children & Family Services (2019) 37
Cal.App.5th 675, 693.)  “[T]he objecting
party has the burden to show that a cost item is unrecoverable because it was
not necessary to the litigation.”  (Hooked
Media Group, Inc. v. Apple Inc. (2020) 55 Cal.App.5th 323, 338.)  “However,
more than a bare objection is needed to rebut the presumption that fees were
reasonable and necessarily incurred.”  (State
of California, supra, 174 Cal.App.3d at p.1075.)
Plaintiff argues that Defendants’ arguments are
conclusory and not supported by law. Moreover, Plaintiff argues he was the
prevailing party in his complaint against Defendant Lim even though he lost
against Defendant Lopez. (11/4/22 Minute Order; Amended Judgment filed
12/19/23.) Plaintiff further argues that he was a prevailing party in the
cross-complaint that was filed and prosecuted by Defendants Lim and Lopez
against him. 
On February 27, 2023, the Court ordered the
following “The jury verdict of $110,000 for quantum meruit shall be offset by
the $103,000.00 that Plaintiff Robert Shtofman has received from settlements
with Alliance United Insurance Company and Arch Insurance Group. Plaintiff is
ordered to file and serve a proposed judgment in accordance with the jury’s
November 4, 2022 verdicts and in accordance with the instant order.” (02/27/23
Minute Order.) 
Filing
Fees
Filing
fees are expressly allowable as costs (CCP §1033.5(a)(1)), thus, the burden is
on Defendants to show that the $8,691.35
in filing costs was not reasonably necessary for the litigation.  Defendants fail to meet this burden as they merely
claim that each of the filing fees sought to be taxed are vague, misleading and
improper because Plaintiff is attempting to seek the collective sum for filing
fees of $7,710.00 for which he was not the prevailing party in violation of CRC
8.278(1) and (2).  However, no evidence
is submitted to support this claim as a Defendants’ memorandum in support of
their motion to tax costs is not evidence and “the court must disregard ‘facts’
contained in an unverified statement.”  (Smith,
Smith & Kring v. Superior Court (Oliver) (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 573,
578.)  "The only evidence the trial court should have
considered and which we may consider here is that contained in the declarations
filed in support of and in opposition to the motion. The matters set forth in the unverified “Statement of Facts” and
in memoranda of points and authorities are not evidence and cannot provide the
basis for the granting of the motion.” (Id.)
Thus,
while all the filing fees incurred may not have been reasonably necessary,
Defendants fail to meet their burden in showing which fees should not be
recovered and why. 
Deposition
Costs
            Defendants seeks to tax $844.85 for Gloria Lopez’s deposition
costs, $621.00 for the video taping of the deposition, and $545.00 for a
Spanish language translator for a total amount of $2,010.85.  The costs for taking, video recording, and
transcribing necessary depositions are expressly permitted as costs.  (CCP § 1033.5(a)(3)(A).)  Therefore, the burden is on Defendants to
show that the costs are unnecessary or unreasonable.  Defendants fail to do so.  
            Defendants also assert that “
Plaintiff did not prevail as against Defendant Gloria Lopez and cannot collect
that cost.” (Mot. to Tax p.7.)  However, no evidence is submitted to support this claim as
a Defendants’ memorandum in support of their motion to tax costs is not
evidence and “the court must disregard ‘facts’ contained in an unverified
statement.”  (Smith, Smith & Kring
v. Superior Court (Oliver) (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 573, 578.)  "The only
evidence the trial court should have considered and which we may consider here
is that contained in the declarations filed in support of and in opposition to
the motion. The matters set forth in the unverified “Statement of Facts” and
in memoranda of points and authorities are not evidence and cannot provide the
basis for the granting of the motion.” (Id.)
            At
most, Defendants merely provide general objections to these costs in their memorandum
in support of their motion to tax costs. 
This is insufficient to tax a permitted cost.  (State of California, supra, 174
Cal.App.3d at p.1075.) Further,  the
depositions taken in this case, including the deposition of Gloria Lopez, were
"reasonably necessary" for Plaintiff to prevail in this case, both in
pre-trial motions and in trial. For instance, the testimony in those
depositions was used to defeat summary judgments brought by Lim and Lopez. The
depositions were also necessary to prevail at trial against Lim. 
 
Service
of Process Costs 
Defendants seeks to tax an unknown amount for
the service of process for parties other than Defendant Julie C. Lim, with whom
he either settled his case or dismissed them as a Defendant. Defendants provide
an example of $300.00 to be taxed however, it is unclear if this is the only
amount sought to be taxed. As stated, the verified Memorandum of Costs serves
as prima facie evidence of their propriety, and the burden is on the party
seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary  Burden of Proof., 7 Witkin, Cal. Proc. 6th
Judgments § 149 (2023). Therefore, the burden is on Defendants to show that the
costs are unnecessary or unreasonable. 
Defendants fail to do so. Defendants merely state that section 877 bars
nonsettling defendants from seeking contribution from settling defendants and
that because Plaintiff settled with Arch and Alliance, Plaintiff released Arch
and Alliance from further liability for service of process costs. (Mot. to Tax
p.7.) However, no evidence is submitted to support this claim as a Defendants’
memorandum in support of their motion to tax costs is not evidence and “the
court must disregard ‘facts’ contained in an unverified statement.”  (Smith, Smith & Kring v. Superior
Court (Oliver) (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 573, 578.)  "The only evidence the trial court
should have considered and which we may consider here is that contained in the
declarations filed in support of and in opposition to the motion. The
matters set forth in the unverified “Statement of Facts” and in memoranda of
points and authorities are not evidence and cannot provide the basis for the
granting of the motion.” (Id.) At most, Defendants merely provide
general objections to these costs in their memorandum in support of their
motion to tax costs. This is insufficient to tax an otherwise permitted
cost.  (State of California, supra,
174 Cal.App.3d at p.1075.)
 
Witness
Fees
            Defendants seek to tax $3,020.00 in
witness fees. Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5(a)(7) and 1033.5(c),
Plaintiff as the prevailing party in tort litigation is expressly permitted and
may recover as cost "ordinary witness fees" as defined in Government
Code section 68093 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1986.5.  Defendants note that the witnesses were never
called to testify. Defendants did not submit any evidence to support this
claim. However, Plaintiff conceded that the witnesses were not called to
testify. Thus, the Court strikes this cost item in its totality. 
 
Court
Ordered Transcripts
            Defendants contend that the Court ordered
transcripts in the sum of $8,828.43 were waived because Plaintiff entered into
a settlement agreement. Court ordered transcripts are expressly permitted and
recoverable under section 1033.5(a)(9) and 1033.S(c) as reasonably necessary
expenses to conduct litigation. Plaintiff was required by the court to pay for
these costs. Defendants did not submit any evidence to support this claim.
Therefore, they did not meet their burden. Thus, these were reasonably
necessary costs. 
 
Court
Reporter Fees
            Defendant contends that the Court
reporter fees in the sum of $10,997.30 were waived because Plaintiff entered
into a settlement agreement.   In
general, Court reporter fees are only permitted in the amount established by
statute.  (CCP § 1033.5(a)(11).)  Moreover, such costs must have been
reasonably incurred.  (CCP § 1033.5(c)(2).)  Defendants fail to meet this burden.  Defendants merely claim that the “court
reporter fees are not applicable as to Gloria Lopez whatsoever (as the
prevailing party), and should not apply as to Defendant Julie C. Lim. Further,
the court reporter fees allegedly incurred on March 24, 2016, was related to
Arch Insurance Group, Inc., of $345.00 (which Plaintiff waived in his
Settlement Agreement with Arch), plaintiff cannot recover the cost as against
Defendant Gloria Lopez. As to Defendant Julie C. Lim, Plaintiff makes no
break-out why such costs were incurred.” (Mot. to Tax p. 8.) However, no
evidence is submitted to support this claim as a Defendants’ memorandum in
support of their motion to tax costs is not evidence and “the court must
disregard ‘facts’ contained in an unverified statement.”  (Smith, Smith & Kring v. Superior
Court (Oliver) (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 573, 578.)  "The only evidence the trial court
should have considered and which we may consider here is that contained in the
declarations filed in support of and in opposition to the motion. The
matters set forth in the unverified “Statement of Facts” and in memoranda of
points and authorities are not evidence and cannot provide the basis for the
granting of the motion.” (Id.) Thus, while such costs may not
have been reasonably necessary, Defendants fail to show as such. 
 
Models,
Enlargements, and Photocopies of Exhibits 
Defendants seek to tax $ 5,124.05 because
“Plaintiff has made no break-out as to which Defendant necessitated the alleged
costs. Therefore, Defendant has no way of determining whether the alleged copy
charges were reasonable and necessary." (Mot. to Tax p.8.) Models. Enlargements,
and photocopies of exhibits are expressly recoverable under sections
1033.5(a)(l3) and 1033.S(c) as reasonably necessary expenses to conduct
litigation. The verified Memorandum of Costs serves as prima facie evidence of
their propriety, and the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show
that they were no reasonable or necessary. Burden of Proof., 7 Witkin, Cal.
Proc. 6th Judgm § 149 (2023). However, no evidence is submitted to support this
claim as a Defendants’ memorandum in support of their motion to tax costs is
not evidence and “the court must disregard ‘facts’ contained in an unverified
statement.”  (Smith, Smith & Kring
v. Superior Court (Oliver) (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 573, 578.)  "The only evidence the trial court
should have considered and which we may consider here is that contained in the
declarations filed in support of and in opposition to the motion. The
matters set forth in the unverified “Statement of Facts” and in memoranda of
points and authorities are not evidence and cannot provide the basis for the
granting of the motion.” (Id.) At most, Defendants merely provide
general objections to these costs in their memorandum in support of their
motion to tax costs.  This is
insufficient to tax a permitted cost.  (State
of California, supra, 174 Cal.App.3d at p.1075.)
 
Fees
for Electronic Filing or Service
Defendants seek to tax $1,804.70 because Defendants
have no way of determining whether the alleged filing fees were reasonable and
necessary. These costs are expressly permitted and recoverable under sections
1033.5(a)(l4) and 3 1033.5(c). However, no evidence is submitted to support this
claim as a Defendants’ memorandum in support of their motion to tax costs is
not evidence and “the court must disregard ‘facts’ contained in an unverified
statement.”  (Smith, Smith & Kring
v. Superior Court (Oliver) (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 573, 578.)  "The only evidence the trial court
should have considered and which we may consider here is that contained in the
declarations filed in support of and in opposition to the motion. The
matters set forth in the unverified “Statement of Facts” and in memoranda of
points and authorities are not evidence and cannot provide the basis for the
granting of the motion.” (Id.) At most, Defendants merely provide
general objections to these costs in their memorandum in support of their
motion to tax costs.  This is
insufficient to tax a permitted cost.  (State
of California, supra, 174 Cal.App.3d at p.1075.)
 
Other
Fees
Defendants seek to tax $1,302.67 because these
include Plaintiff’s appellate filings in which the Defendants were the
prevailing parties. The Memorandum of Costs requests $1,302.67 in other fees
including 16 remote court appearances ($15.00 each), courtesy copies, and
binding costs for petitions. However, no evidence is submitted to support this
claim as a Defendants’ memorandum in support of their motion to tax costs is
not evidence and “the court must disregard ‘facts’ contained in an unverified
statement.”  (Smith, Smith & Kring
v. Superior Court (Oliver) (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 573, 578.)  "The only evidence the trial court
should have considered and which we may consider here is that contained in the
declarations filed in support of and in opposition to the motion. The
matters set forth in the unverified “Statement of Facts” and in memoranda of
points and authorities are not evidence and cannot provide the basis for the
granting of the motion.” (Id.) At most, Defendants merely provide
general objections to these costs in their memorandum in support of their
motion to tax costs.  This is
insufficient to tax a permitted cost.  (State
of California, supra, 174 Cal.App.3d at p.1075.)
 
Conclusion and ORDER
Based
on the foregoing, Defendants motion to tax costs is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED
IN PART.  
Plaintiff’s
costs are granted in a reduced total amount of $45,001.84. The Court strikes
the $3,020.00 in witness fees.
Moving
Party to give notice and file proof of service of such.
