And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge grants Defendant Pacific Santa Fe Industrial's application to stay discovery until the hearing on the Demurrer or until after the time to respond to a Second Amended Complaint. The Judge notes that Plaintiff Greg Modesti has sued for breach of contract, but the real party at interest is Greg Modesti, dba Just Pottery, Inc. Therefore, Plaintiff Greg Modesti is not the proper plaintiff, which Defendant is challenging in its Demurrer and Motion to Strike. The Judge cites Silver v. City of Los Angeles (1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 673, 674–675, which states that once it is recognized that a plaintiff has no claim, all concerned should be spared the expense of further proceedings.
