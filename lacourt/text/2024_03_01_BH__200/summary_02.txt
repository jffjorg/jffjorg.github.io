And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for summary judgment filed by Fidelity, which claims a lien on a property. The motion is unclear about what statute of limitations applies to the causes of action, and the judge finds that the three-year statute does not apply in this case. The judge also notes that Fidelity did not file a notice and statement of lien until July 2019, which is after the petition was filed. The judge is also considering the validity of the 2011 and 2017 abstracts, which were allegedly issued by Fidelity. The judge is not convinced that the abstracts are valid due to a discrepancy in the social security numbers and the fact that Fidelity allegedly knew McCoy's social security number and driver's license number but did not include them on the abstracts. The judge is also considering the impact of the validity of any lien in favor of Fidelity on CNC. The judge will need more information before making a final ruling.
