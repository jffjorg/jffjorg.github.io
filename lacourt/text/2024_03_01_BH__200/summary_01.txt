And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is on a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication of the first and seventh causes of action. The case involves a trust created by Hazel Winchester in 2004, which was managed by her children, including Bernard and Shelia. Bernard and McCoy, a friend of Bernard's, took money from the trust without Shelia's knowledge or consent. Fidelity National Title Insurance Company, as successor-in-interest to Lawyers Title Insurance Corporation, obtained a default judgment against McCoy in 2010 and filed a notice and statement of lien in 2019. Shelia filed a petition for breach of trust, fraud, conversion, cancellation of instruments, declaratory relief, recovery of property, and quiet title in 2018.

Fidelity argues that Shelia's petition is barred by the three-year statute of limitation for fraud, but Shelia contends that the four-year statute of limitation applies or that the statute did not start running until she learned of the alleged fraud in 2016. The judge finds that there are material factual issues as to the dispute between Fidelity and Shelia, including whether Shelia knew about the fraud in 2014 and whether McCoy became a trustee of the trust. The judge denies both the motion for summary judgment and for summary adjudication of the first and seventh causes of action, allowing the case to proceed to trial.
