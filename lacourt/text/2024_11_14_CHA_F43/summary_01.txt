And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to a second amended answer and a motion to strike. The case concerns a dispute between KB Salt Lake III, LLC, HWP One, LLC, and APG De Soto-SPE, LLC (Plaintiffs) and Fitness International, LLC (Defendant) regarding a breach of a lease agreement. The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendant stopped paying rent to hundreds of its landlords during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Defendant has asserted an affirmative defense based on an alleged breach of contract, claiming that Plaintiffs' predecessor-in-interest, KB, breached the lease agreement by colluding with counsel for other landlords.

The Judge has sustained the demurrer to the Defendant's second amended answer, finding that the affirmative defense of offset is barred by the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel. The Judge has also granted the motion to strike certain language from the Defendant's second amended answer.

The Court has reviewed the documents submitted by the parties and agrees with the Plaintiffs' reasoning. The Defendant cannot argue breach of contract based on the confidentiality clause because that argument previously failed in the prior UD action. The Defendant also cannot claim an offset based on a breach of the confidentiality provision because this Court found in its previous order that such a breach would not excuse the Defendant's rent obligations.
