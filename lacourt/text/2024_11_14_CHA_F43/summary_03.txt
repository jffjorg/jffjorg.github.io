The tentative ruling grants the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Attorney Ross C. Dwyer, representing Defendant Artavazd Babayan. The motion was filed without opposition from the Plaintiff. The Judge finds that the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and the association of new counsel to represent the Defendant justify the request for withdrawal. The Judge cites People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406 and California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362 in support of the ruling. The motion is granted, and the moving party is required to give notice.
