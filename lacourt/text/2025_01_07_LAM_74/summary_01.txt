And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Conell v. Transdev Services Inc. et al. In this ruling, the judge addresses two separate motions filed by the defendants: a motion for leave to file a first amended answer and a motion for leave to file a motion for judgment on the pleadings.

Regarding the motion for leave to file a first amended answer, the judge finds that the defendants' declaration accompanying the motion is incomplete and does not provide the required information about when the additional facts giving rise to the amended pleadings were discovered or why the request for amendment was not made earlier. As a result, the judge denies the motion.

Regarding the motion for leave to file a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the judge finds that the defendants' proposed motion raises non-frivolous federal preemption issues and that the motion asserts dispositive jurisdictional issues. Therefore, the judge grants the defendants leave to file their motion for judgment on the pleadings.
