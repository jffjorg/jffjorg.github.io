Case No.: 23NWCV03112
Hearing Date: October 31, 2024 @ 10:30 a.m. 
 
Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiffs Zhenhai Huang and Zhiquan Li Motion
to Set Aside Dismissal is GRANTED. 
Sanctions are awarded to Defendant in the
amount of $800.00, payable within 30 days of notice of this order. 
 
Background

This case arises out of a motor vehicle accident. The
Complaint alleges that on or about July 6, 2022 Plaintiffs Zhenhai Huang and
Zhiquan Li (collectively “Plaintiffs”) were in a motor vehicle accident with
Defendants Anthony Hernandez, Paul Anthony Araw, and Reyes Coca-Cola Bottling
LLC (collectively “Defendants”) alleging one cause of action for negligence. 
An answer was filed by Defendants Paul Anthony Araw and
Reyes Coca-Cola Bottling LLC on November 29, 2023. On May 9, 2024, at the Case
Management Conference Plaintiffs’ counsel did not appear. On August 22, 2024,
Plaintiffs counsel again did not appear for the OSC: re Dismissal as to why the
case should not be dismissed for counsel for the plaintiff’s failure to appear
on May 9, 2024 and the case was dismissed without prejudice. (8-22-24 Minute
Order.) 
On September 25, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion
for order granting relief from dismissal. 
Request for Judicial Notice
Plaintiffs request that the
Court take judicial notice of the Court’s January 31, 2024,
May 9, 2024, and August 22, 2024 Minute Orders. 
The
Court may take judicial notice of official legislative, executive, and judicial
acts and records of any court of this state or any court of record of the
United States or of any state of the United States.  (Evid. Code §§ 452(c)
and (d).)  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s requests for judicial notice one
through four seeking judicial notice of these judicial records are
GRANTED.  Though the Court may take judicial notice of the docket and
filings within, the Court may not take judicial notice of the truth of their
contents. (See Herrera v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2011) 196
Cal.App.4th 1366, 1375.) 
 
Legal Standard 
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a
party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or
other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall
be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted….” (emphasis added.)
(CCP §473(b).) 
Discussion

Counsel declares that the error at issue here was solely
and exclusively an attorney error for which Plaintiffs’ attorney takes full
responsibility. In particular, due to an error in scheduling, the May 9, 2024,
hearing was not properly calendared at Plaintiffs’ counsel’s law firm. There
was also a subsequent failure on the part of Plaintiffs’ counsel’s law firm to
calendar the August 22, 2024 Order to Show Cause Hearing, and thereby failed to
schedule a court-call appearance. (Lee Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.) 
The Court is persuaded that relief is mandatory, given the
error of the counsel. 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside Dismissal is
GRANTED. 
Sanctions
“The court shall, whenever relief is granted based on an
attorney’s affidavit of fault, direct the attorney to pay reasonable
compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing counsel or parties.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)
Defense counsel request attorneys’ fees for the appearances
at the May and August hearings for a total of $800.00 (1 hour preparing for and
attending the hearings at an hourly rate of $400.00). 
The Court GRANTS sanctions in the amount of $800.00.
