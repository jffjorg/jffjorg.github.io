Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The dismissal was due to the plaintiff's counsel's failure to appear at two hearings, resulting in the case being dismissed without prejudice. The judge found that the error was excusable and that the plaintiff's counsel took full responsibility for the mistake. As a result, the judge granted the motion to set aside the dismissal. Additionally, the judge awarded sanctions to the defendant in the amount of $800.00, payable within 30 days, for the defendant's counsel's time and effort in preparing for and attending the hearings.
