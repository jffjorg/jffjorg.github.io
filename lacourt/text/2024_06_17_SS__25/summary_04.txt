And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling in this case is that the defendant's demurrer with motion to strike is continued to July 23, 2024. The defendant is required to file a proof of service demonstrating that the plaintiff was served with the demurrer and motion to strike and notice of the continued hearing. Failure to do so may result in the motions being placed off calendar or denied.

The court's analysis is based on the legal standard for a demurrer, which tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. The court must treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. The court cannot rule on the demurrer and motion to strike until the plaintiff has been given notice in accordance with the statutory requirements.

The defendant's demurrer with motion to strike is based on the grounds that the complaint does not state a cause of action. The defendant argues that the proof of service showing that the demurrer and motion to strike have been served on the plaintiff is lacking. The court finds that the defendant's failure to give notice of the motion is a violation of the statutory requirements and due process.

The court orders the defendant to give notice and to attach a copy of the court's tentative ruling as an exhibit "A" to said notice.
