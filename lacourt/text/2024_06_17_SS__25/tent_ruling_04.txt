 BACKGROUND 
 
 
On
February 14, 2024, Plaintiff Raffi Ezikian (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint
against Defendant Christina Khatchadourian (“Defendant”) for (1) reasonable
value, (2) account stated, (3) open book account, (4) breach of contract, (5)
breach of good faith and fair dealing, and (6) negligent misrepresentation.
 
The complaint
alleges that Defendant obtained a loan from Plaintiff in the amount of $9,900
for a down payment towards a new car. Defendant’s counsel told Plaintiff that
the $9,900 was a gift and Defendant would not be repaying Plaintiff.
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
A.   
Legal
Standard 
 
A demurrer for sufficiency
tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and
Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.) The court “treat[s] the
demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law ….” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 525).) In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent
on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994).) A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters; therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.) The only issue
involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra,
147 Cal.App.4th at 747.) 
 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)  The burden is on the complainant
to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.) 
 
Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading, may
serve and file a motion to strike the whole or any part thereof – i.e., even
single words or phrases. (Code. Civ. Proc. § 435(b)(1)); Warren v. Atchison,
Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. (1971) 19 Cal App.3d 24, 40.) A motion to
strike lies either: (1) to strike any “irrelevant, false or improper matter
inserted in any pleading”; and/or (2) to strike any pleading or part thereof
“not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule or
order of court.” (Code. Civ. Proc. § 436; Ferraro v. Camarlinghi (2008)
161 Cal.App.4th 509, 528.) As with demurrers, the grounds for a motion to
strike must appear on the face of the pleading, or from any matter which the
court may judicially notice. (Code Civ. Proc. § 437.) 
 
B.    
Discussion
 
There
is no proof of service showing that the demurrer and motion to strike have been
served on Plaintiff. Failure to give notice of a
motion is not only a violation of the statutory requirements but of due
process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones v. Otero (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d
754, 757.)  The court cannot rule on the
demurrer and motion to strike until Plaintiff has been give notice in
accordance with the statutory requirements.
 
 Conclusion
 
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant’s
Demurrer with Motion to Strike are CONTINUED to JULY 23, 2024 at 10:00 A.M.
in Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse.                
 
At least five (5) court days
before the next scheduled hearing, Defendant must file a proof of service
demonstrating Plaintiff was served with the Demurrer and Motion to Strike and
notice of this continued hearing. Failure to do so may result in the Motions
being placed off calendar or denied.   
 
 
The Moving
Party is ordered to give notice and to attach a copy of the Court’s Tentative
Ruling, as an exhibit “A” to said notice, as the final order of the Court.
