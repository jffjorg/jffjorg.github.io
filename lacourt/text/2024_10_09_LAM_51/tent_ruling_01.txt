STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On September 5, 2023, Plaintiff Alal, LLC dba Kei-Ai Los
Angeles Healthcare Center (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint against Defendant State
of California Department of Public Health (Defendant) seeking an order
dismissing Citation No. 92-6637600-0018822-S issued by Defendant against
Plaintiff. 
 
On October 3, 2023, Defendant filed a general denial.
 
Plaintiff filed the instant motion on June 21, 2024.
Oppositions were due on or before September 25, 2024. As of October 4, 2024,
the court has not received an opposition from Defendant.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
“Any party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not
privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending
action or to the determination of any motion made in that action, if the matter
either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.)¿ 
¿ 
“…If a subpoena requires the attendance of a witness or the
production of books, documents, electronically stored information, or other
things before a court, or at the trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of
a deposition, the court…may make an order quashing the subpoena entirely,
modifying it, or directing compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as
the court shall declare, including protective orders.” (CCP § 1987.1(a).) A
court may quash a subpoena entirely or partially, and issue an order to protect
parties, witnesses or consumers from unreasonable or oppressive demands
including violations of privacy. (CCP §1987.1.)¿ 
 
A party may move
to quash a defective deposition notice. (CCP § 2025.410(c).)
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Motion to Quash
 
Plaintiff contends the court should quash the deposition
subpoena to Nurse Ramsini because it has multiple procedural defects. Defendant
has not filed an opposition.
 
CCP § 2034.410 provides that “[o]n receipt of an expert
witness list from a party, any other party may take the deposition of any
person on the list” pursuant to the same procedures for taking oral depositions
as otherwise provided per code. CCP § 2025.220 provides the requisite form and
contents of a deposition notice. Notice is mandatory. (CCP § 2025.220(a).) The
deposing party is required to give notice “to every other party who has
appeared in the action.” (CCP § 2025.240(a).) Such notice “shall be scheduled
for a date at least 10 days after service of the deposition notice” unless the
deponent is also required to produce records in which case “the deposition
shall be scheduled for a date at least 20 days after issuance of that
subpoena.” (CCP § 2025.270(a), (c).)
 
Here, Defendant’s deposition subpoena is defective due to
lack of notice.[1]
Notably, Defendant did not timely provide notice to Plaintiff because they set
the deposition for June 24, 2024 but did not notify Plaintiff until June 17,
2024 which is less than 10 days’ notice and well less than 20 days’ notice for
production of records. (Swann Decl. Exhibit 4.) Plaintiff also timely objected
to the defective notice. (Swann Decl. Exhibit 7.) 
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to
quash.
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff requests $4,550.00 in sanctions against Defendant
for misusing the discovery process representing eight hours of work preparing
this motion, an anticipated four hours responding to an opposition, and one
hour attending the hearing at counsel’s hourly rate of $350.00. (Swann Decl. ¶
8.) Defendant did not file an opposition.
 
CCP § 2025.410(d) provides for mandatory sanctions against a
party “who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to quash a deposition
notice, unless it finds that one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” 
 
Here, sanctions are warranted despite lack of opposition.
Indeed, it appears there has been no further action on this deposition at all
since late June. However, the amount Plaintiff requests is unreasonable. First,
there was no opposition so there was no need to review it and to respond to it.
Second, this is not a complicated motion necessitating two hours, let alone
eight hours of work. As such, the court will award 1.5 hours at counsel’s rate
of $350.00 per hour for a total of $525.
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for
sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.Motion to Quash Deposition
Subpoena of Shirin Ramsini, R.N., B.S.N. is GRANTED;
2.Plaintiff is awarded $525.00 in
monetary sanctions payable by Defendant within 30 days’ notice of this ruling.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
