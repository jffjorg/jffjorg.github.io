BACKGROUND                    
            On September
26, 2024, Petitioners filed a petition to confirm arbitration award (the
“Petition”) of $399,099.11 in their favor as against Respondents Boris Pilch, M.D.,
an individual, and Pilch Investments and Management, LLC (“Respondents”)
awarded by a JAMS arbitrator on July 25, 2024. The Petition seeks confirmation
of the award and judgment according to the award. 
 
DISCUSSION
            “Any party to an arbitration in
which an award has been made may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate
the award.” (Code Civil Procedure (“CCP”), § 1285.) 
 
“A proceeding under th[e] [Arbitration
title of the Code of Civil Procedure] in the courts of this State [i.e.,
pursuant to CCP §§ 1280-1294.4] is commenced by filing a petition. Any person
named as a respondent in a petition may file a response thereto. The
allegations of a petition are deemed to be admitted by a respondent duly served
therewith unless a response is duly served and filed. The allegations of a
response are deemed controverted or avoided.” (CCP, § 1290.) 
 
The petition must: “(a) [s]et forth the
substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the
petitioner denies the existence of such an agreement”; “(b) [s]et forth the
names of the arbitrators” and “(c) [s]et forth or have attached a copy of the
award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.” (CCP, § 1285.4.) The
petition must also “name as respondents all parties to the arbitration and may
name as respondents any other persons bound by the arbitration award.” (CCP, §
1285.) A petition to confirm an award must be served and filed within four
years after the date the petitioner was served with a signed copy of the award.
(CCP, § 1288.)  
 
If a petition or response requesting
confirmation is duly filed and served, the court must confirm, correct and
confirm, or vacates the award or dismiss the proceeding. (CCP, § 1286; see Horn
v. Gurewitz (1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 255, 258; Pacific Law Group U.S.A. v.
Gibson (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 577, 580; Cooper v. Lavely & Singer
Professional Corp. (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 1, 10.) 
 
“The court may not vacate an award unless
… [¶] [a] petition or response requesting that the award be vacated has been
duly served or filed ….” (CCP, § 1286.4, subd. (a).)  A response seeking
to correct and confirm or vacate an arbitration award must be served and filed
within ten days of service of a petition to confirm that same arbitration
award, unless the timeframe is extended by agreement of the parties or “for
good cause, by order of the court.” Thus, a court may not vacate an award
pursuant to a petition for that relief that was not duly served or filed. (See Oaktree
Capital Mgmt., L.P. v. Bernard (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 60, 64 [a response
served out of the ten-day window has not been “duly served” as required for
relief by Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.4].) 
 
“If an [arbitration] award is confirmed,
judgment shall be entered in conformity therewith. The judgment so entered has
the same force and effect as and is subject to all the provisions of law
relating to, a judgment in a civil action of the same jurisdictional
classification; and it may be enforced like any other judgment of the court in
which it is entered, in an action of the same jurisdictional classification.”
(CCP, § 1287.4.) 
 
Petitioners have satisfied the procedural
requirements for a petition to confirm an arbitration award. 
 
Petitioners provided a copy of the
Settlement Agreement containing an Arbitration Clause. (Pet., Attachment 4(b)) The
Petition names the arbitrator (Pet., ¶ 6 [“Hon. Joseph R. Brisco (Ret.)”) and
attaches a copy of the Final Arbitration Award. (Pet., Attachment 8(c); CCP, §
1285.4) 
 
The Petition also names Boris Pilch, M.D., an individual, and Pilch Investments
and Management, LLC as Respondents. (CCP, § 1285; Pet. ¶ 1.)
 
Last, the Petition was served and filed
within four years after the date Respondents were served with a signed copy of
the award. (CCP, § 1288; see Pet., ¶ 9 [“Petitioner alleges that a signed copy
of the award was actually served on (date): September 10, 2024”].)  
 
The Petition is unopposed. Thus, the Petition
to confirm the arbitration award is not controverted and the allegations in the
Petition are accepted as true. (CCP, § 1290.) 
 
Thus, the Petition is GRANTED. 
 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
