MOVING PARTY:  Defendant ASND, LLC (“Defendant”) 
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
Nancy Martinez (“Martinez”) 
 
            The Court has considered the moving
and opposition papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
            This is a Private Attorneys General
Act (“PAGA”) action. On June 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative complaint
(the “Complaint”) against Defendant and Does 1 through 25 alleging a Representative
Claim for PAGA penalties under California Labor Code sections 201, 202, 203,
204 and/or 204b, 210, 226, 226.3, 226.7, 233, 246, 510, 512, 558, 1174, 1174.5,
1194, 1197.1, 1198, 2802, and IWC Wage Order 5-2001). 
 
            On December 9, 2024, Defendant filed
an amended motion to compel arbitration (the “Motion”). On December 18, 2024,
Plaintiff filed an opposition to the Motion (the “Opposition”).            
 
DISCUSSION
            The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”),
while a federal statute, applies in California courts and requires state courts
to enforce arbitration agreements as required by the federal common law
developed under the FAA. (Southland Corp. v. Keating (1984) 465 U.S. 1,
15-16.) The FAA preempts and invalidates state law and state judicial decisions
that disfavor arbitration or require arbitration provisions to pass higher
scrutiny. (Southland Corp., supra (1984) 465 U.S. at 12; Perry
v. Thomas (1987) 482 U.S. 483, 490.) If the parties designate the FAA
applies, then California arbitration law is preempted. (Rodriguez v.
American Techs., Inc. (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1121-1122.)
 
¿           A court’s inquiry is limited to a
determination of (1) whether a valid arbitration agreement exists and (2)
whether the arbitration agreement covers the dispute. (9 U.S.C. § 4; Chiron
Corp. v. Ortho Diagnostics Systems, Inc. (9th Cir. 2000) 207 F.3d 1126,
1130; Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. (2002) 537 U.S. 79, 84; Simula,
Inc. v. Autoliv, Inc. (9th Cir. 1999) 175 F.3d 716, 720 [if the finding is
affirmative on both counts the FAA requires the Court to enforce the
arbitration agreement in accordance with its terms]; Lacayo v. Cataline
Restaurant Group Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 244, 257 [Where moving party
meets initial burden, “the party opposing arbitration must prove by a
preponderance of the evidence any defense to the petition”].) 
 
The FAA governs all agreements to
arbitrate in contracts “involving interstate commerce.” (Higgins v. Superior
Court (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1238, 1247.) The term “involving” commerce “is
broad and is indeed the functional equivalent of “affecting’ commerce.” (Allied-Bruce
Terminix Companies, Inc. v. Dobson (1995) 513 U.S. 265, 273-274.) The U.S.
Supreme Court has held that this broad interpretation includes employment
contracts. (Circuit City Stores v. Adams (2001) 532 U.S. 105, 106.) The
defendant bears the burden of proving applicability of the FAA by showing that
its activities constitute interstate commerce. (Hoover v. Am. Income Life
Ins. Co. (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1207.) Failure to demonstrate that
the employment agreement affects interstate commerce renders the FAA
inapplicable. (Lane v. Francis Capital Management LLC (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 676, 687-688.) 
 
Arbitration
Agreement
“Parties are not required to arbitrate
their disagreements unless they have agreed to do so. A contract to arbitrate
will not be inferred absent a ‘clear agreement.’ When determining whether a
valid contract to arbitrate exists, we apply ordinary state law principles that
govern contract formation. In California, a ‘clear agreement’ to arbitrate may
be either express or implied in fact.” (Davis v. Nordstrom, Inc. (9th
Cir. 2014) 755 F.3d 1089, 1092-93 [applying California law] [internal citations
omitted].) 
 
            In support of the Motion, Defendant
attaches a copy of the ‘Mutual Agreement to Arbitrate Employment-Related
Disputes’ (the “Arbitration Agreement”) executed by Plaintiff on July 7, 2023.
(Yacoub Decl., Ex. A.) Plaintiff does not dispute the existence or validity of the
Arbitration Agreement but rather argues that Defendant has not shown that the
FAA applies. The Arbitration Agreement expressly states, however, that it is
governed by the FAA: “This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq.
("FAA").” (Yacoub Decl., Ex. A, § 7) In addition, Defendant asserts
that Plaintiff’s employment with Defendant involves interstate commerce because
Defendant purchases medical supplies from Illinois and receives payments from
Medicare. (Yacoub Decl. ¶¶ 7-8) The U.S. Supreme Court has held that contracts
‘involving commerce’ include employment contracts. (Circuit City Stores,
supra 532 U.S. at 106.)
 
Thus, Defendant met its burden that an
arbitration agreement exists. 
 
Arbitrability
of PAGA Claims
            Defendant argues that whether
Plaintiff has standing to bring her representative PAGA claims depends on
whether Plaintiff is an ‘aggrieved employee’ and thus this issue must first be
resolved by an arbitrator before Plaintiff can proceed to litigate the
representative PAGA claims. (Mot. pp. 5:22-6:12) In relevant portion, the
Arbitration Agreement states: “The Arbitrator shall have the authority to
adjudicate any cause of action or the entire claim pursuant to a motion to
dismiss, motion for summary adjudication and/or motion for summary judgment.” (Yacoub
Decl., Ex. A, § 8) Plaintiff’s ‘aggrieved employee’ status is not a standalone
cause of action or claim, it is an element of an ‘individual’ PAGA claim. Upon
review of the Complaint, Plaintiff brings only a single cause of action for ‘Representative
Claim for PAGA penalties.’ (Complaint, p. 9.) Thus, because Plaintiff chooses
not to assert an ‘individual’ PAGA claim, there is nothing to send to
arbitration and no claim for an arbitrator to resolve.
 
            Defendant argues that Balderas v.
Fresh Start Harvesting, Inc., (2024) 101 Cal.App.5th 533 “does not stand
for the proposition that a representative PAGA claim can proceed in court where
a valid arbitration agreement exists” (Mot. p. 10:2-4.) If Plaintiff had
brought an individual PAGA claim, the “aggrieved employee” status may be
determined as part of arbitration for the individual PAGA claim, but this does
not logically result in the conclusion that Plaintiff must arbitrate the
question of “aggrieved employee” status when Plaintiff only alleges a
representative claim. 
 
            Thus, Defendant’s Motion to Compel
Arbitration is DENIED. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
