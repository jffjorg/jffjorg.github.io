And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Justice in Aging (JIA) v. California Department of Healthcare Services. JIA filed a Complaint and Petition for Writ of Mandate, alleging that the Department failed to comply with its Public Records Act (PRA) requests for "quality measure information regarding the Assisted Living Waiver" for Medicaid. The Department produced a 34-page report from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), with redactions to protect information security records. The Department argues that the redactions are proper because the report was written for internal use and includes sensitive information about its MedCompass system architecture. JIA argues that the redactions are too vague and don't relate to information security records, and that the public would benefit greatly from knowing how MedCompass works.

In the tentative ruling, the judge finds that the redactions are proper because they relate to information that poses a security risk. The redacted portions of the report relate to how the MedCompass system interacts and connects with other systems, which could be exploited by hackers to obtain patient information. The judge concludes that the public interest served by nondisclosure outweighs the public interest in disclosure, and that the Department has shown that the redactions are justified under Government Code Section 7922.000. The Department is ordered to give notice of the tentative ruling, and counsel are strongly encouraged to submit briefs on the tentative or appear by LACourtConnect due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## English Summary

The judge has reviewed a complaint filed by Justice In Aging (JIA) against the California Department of Healthcare Services (the Department) regarding the Department's redactions of a report from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).  JIA alleges the Department failed to comply with a Public Records Act (PRA) request, while the Department argues the redactions are necessary to protect the security of their MedCompass system. 

The judge agrees with the Department, finding that the redacted information, which relates to the inner workings of the MedCompass system, could pose a security risk if released publicly. The judge believes this risk outweighs the public's interest in knowing exactly how the system functions.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the report produced by the California Department of Healthcare Services (the Department) in response to a public records request from Justice In Aging (JIA). The report was redacted to protect information security, specifically to prevent the disclosure of how the Department's internal system (MedCompass) interacts with other systems. The Department claims that this information could be exploited by hackers to obtain patient information. The judge agrees that the redactions are proper because they relate to information that poses a security risk. The judge also finds that the public interest served by not disclosing the record (i.e., the redacted information) clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record. Therefore, the Department's redactions are upheld. The Department is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
