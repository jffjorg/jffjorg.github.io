And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Justice in Aging (JIA) v. California Department of Healthcare Services. JIA filed a Complaint and Petition for Writ of Mandate, alleging that the Department failed to comply with its Public Records Act (PRA) requests for "quality measure information regarding the Assisted Living Waiver" for Medicaid. The Department produced a 34-page report from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), with redactions to protect information security records. The Department argues that the redactions are proper because the report was written for internal use and includes sensitive information about its MedCompass system architecture. JIA argues that the redactions are too vague and don't relate to information security records, and that the public would benefit greatly from knowing how MedCompass works.

In the tentative ruling, the judge finds that the redactions are proper because they relate to information that poses a security risk. The redacted portions of the report relate to how the MedCompass system interacts and connects with other systems, which could be exploited by hackers to obtain patient information. The judge concludes that the public interest served by nondisclosure outweighs the public interest in disclosure, and that the Department has shown that the redactions are justified under Government Code Section 7922.000. The Department is ordered to give notice of the tentative ruling, and counsel are strongly encouraged to submit briefs on the tentative or appear by LACourtConnect due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
