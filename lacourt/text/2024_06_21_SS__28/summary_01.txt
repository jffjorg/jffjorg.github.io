The judge has considered the moving papers and joinder and has ruled as follows. The case is a motor vehicle tort, general negligence, and emotional distress lawsuit filed by Yemane G. Gebregziabher against Bethelhem Tesfaye, Maricruz Chia, and Does 1-20. Tesfaye inadvertently waived her right to a jury trial by posting jury fees after the deadline. Plaintiff joins in Tesfaye's request for relief from the waiver. The court finds that granting Tesfaye relief from the waiver will not prejudice Plaintiff or Chia. The court exercises its discretion to grant the motion. The court grants Defendant Bethelhem Tesfaye's motion for relief from the waiver of a jury trial.
