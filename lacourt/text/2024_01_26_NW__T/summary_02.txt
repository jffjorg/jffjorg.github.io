And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the plaintiff's motion for sanctions against the defendant and is inclined to continue the matter to allow the defendant to provide evidence. The court wants to see copies of improper emails, internet harassment, and social media postings, including a Tik Tok posting, made against the defendant by the plaintiffs or their counsel. The court also wants evidence that the plaintiffs or their counsel recorded the defendant in the courthouse. The judge is concerned about the defendant's home address being provided to Enamorato and wants to know why the counsel did not block emails from the defendant. The court reminds the defendant that he is subject to a civil harassment restraining order and that the emails and social media postings may constitute a violation of that order. The court also wants to clarify what the reference to "cross-defendants" in the defendant's opposition means, as it is not reflected in the court file.
