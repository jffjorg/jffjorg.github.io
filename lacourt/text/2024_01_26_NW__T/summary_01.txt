And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant, Minoo Nejadbakhsh, is granted permission to set aside the default entered against her on November 29, 2023. The defendant had filed a motion to set aside the default, citing mistake, excusable neglect, and lack of actual notice. The judge found that the defendant had met her burden by presenting facts disputing the alleged location of service, and that the plaintiff had failed to file an opposition to the motion. As a result, the judge has granted the defendant's motion to set aside the default and ordered the defendant to file and serve a proposed answer within 20 days.
