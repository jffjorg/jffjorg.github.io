  Case Number:  23VECV00956    Hearing Date:   January 26, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV00956 KNOX V NEJADBAKHSH
[TENTATIVE] ORDER: 
Defendant Minoo Nejadbakhsh’s Unopposed and Amended Motion to Set Aside
Default is GRANTED.  Defendant Minoo
Nejadbakhsh is ORDERED to file and serve the Proposed Answer, attached as
Exhibit A to the Amended Motion within 20 days.
Introduction 
Defendant Minoo Nejadbakhsh’s (Defendant) motion to set
aside the default entered on November 29, 2023 (November Default) by Plaintiff
Jill Knox (Plaintiff).  The original
motion was filed on December 15, 2023 and an amended motion was filed on
December 29, 2023.  The Court reviewed
the amended motion because the amended motion superseded the original
motion.  Plaintiff did not file an opposition.  
Discussion  
Defendant asserted that the November Default should be set
aside due to mistake, excusable neglect, and lack of actual notice.  (Code Civ. Proc., secs. 473(b) and
473.5.)  The Court file reflects three
separate proofs of service being filed. 
The first proof of service was filed on April 10, 2023 (April POS)
asserting personal service upon Defendant on February 3, 2023. Plaintiff also
filed a proof of service on May 30, 2023 (May POS) reflecting personal service
upon Defendant on March 10, 2023 at 2:00 PM.  The Court struck the April POS and May POS at
the June 12, 2023 hearing on Defendant’s Motion to Quash.  Because the April POS and May POS were
quashed/stricken, default could not have been entered based upon the April POS
and May POS.  Because default was not
entered based upon the April POS and May POS, the April POS and May POS are not
at issue and not considered.
Plaintiff then filed the third proof of service on November
29, 2023 (November POS) reflecting personal service upon Defendant on September
12, 2023 ant 9:20 AM.  The November POS
and November Default were both filed concurrently at 4:53 PM.  Defendant’s declaration provided facts
disputing the alleged September 12, 2023 personal service.  Defendant provided that she was not at 6230
Sylmar Ave. as alleged in the November POS but at 14400 Erwin St. Mall in Dept.
R of the Van Nuys Court.  (Defendant’s
Decl. pars. 4-5 and Exh. C; Russell Halpern Decl. par. 2-3.)  Defendant met her burden to show either
excusable neglect/surprise or lack of actual notice of the action because facts
were presented disputing the veracity of the alleged location of service in the
November POS.  Plaintiff’s failure to
file an opposition showed that Plaintiff submitted to the requested
relief.  For good cause shown, Defendant’s
amended motion is persuasive.
The motion to set aside the default is GRANTED.  
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
