 Case Number:  23VECV01049    Hearing Date:   January 26, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV01049
Alvarez v McGuire
Tentative
ruling:  Plaintiffs’ motion for sanctions
against defendant.
The court
is inclined to continue the matter to allow defendant to provide a declaration
attaching copies of improper emails, internet harassment, and social media
postings (including the Tik Tok posting) which have been made against him by plaintiffs
and/or their counsel.  The court would
also like to see evidence that plaintiffs or counsel recorded defendant in the
courthouse.  What is the evidence that
counsel provided Enamorato with defendant’s home address? Why has
counsel not blocked emails from defendant?
The court
reminds defendant that he is the subject of a civil harassment restraining
order issued 10/4/2022 (expires 10/4/2027) in Alvarez v McGuire 22STRO05803 which
prohibits his harassment of plaintiff Alvarez. These emails -- by their language -- may constitute violation of the restraining order.
Finally,
there is reference to “cross-defendants” in defendant’s opposition, but the
court file does not reflect the filing of a cross-complaint/  To what does this reference?
