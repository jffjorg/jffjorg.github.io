TENTATIVE RULING
ON EX PARTE APPLICATION TO ADJUST DATES
The motion
to disqualify is scheduled to be heard by Dept. 1.  Any request to move the hearing date of
2/15/2024 should be filed in Dept. 1.
Trial is
set 4/8/2024 and the Final Status Conference is 3/22/2024.  The court would be willing to move the FSC to
3/29/2024 and order that motions in limine be filed no later than 3/8/2024,
oppositions by 3/18/2024 and replies by 3/26/2024.  This would allow the MSJs to stay on calendar
as scheduled for 2/22/2024.
