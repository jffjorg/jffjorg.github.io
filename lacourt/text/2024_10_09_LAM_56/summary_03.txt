* "A prevailing party in civil litigation is entitled to recover his or her costs as a matter of right."
* "A prevailing defendant shall not be awarded fees and costs unless the court finds the action was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless when brought, or the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so."
* "Lack of merit is not the proper standard. Rather, the case must be egregious and/or baseless."
* "A case that is at least colorable, though it is not ultimately supported with adequate evidence, is not frivolous or vexatious for the purpose of attorneys' fees."
