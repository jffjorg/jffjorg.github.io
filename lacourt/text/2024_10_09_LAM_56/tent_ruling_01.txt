Probation Department and Los Angeles County Probation Department (“Defendant”
or the “County”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
GABRIELA HERNANDEZ (“Plaintiff”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
            This action
arises out of an employment relationship. 
The operative second amended complaint (the “SAC”) alleges: (1)
discrimination; (2) harassment; (3) retaliation; (4) failure to
prevent
retaliation/harassment/discrimination; (5) violation of the Family Medical
Leave Act; (6)
failure to
accommodate; and (7) failure to engage in good faith interactive process.  On August 17, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings to the second
cause of action
for harassment.[1]  
 
            On June 12, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Summary
Adjudication (the “Motion”) on the ground that no triable issue of facts exists
on Plaintiff’s remaining six causes of action. 
Plaintiff filed an opposition on September 25, 2024, and Defendant filed
a reply on October 2, 2024.  
                        
DISCUSSION
Legal Standard
The function of a motion for summary judgment or
adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot
show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of
summary dismissal without the need for trial.  (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  CCP Section 437c(c) “requires the trial judge
to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences
reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences
or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and
that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler
v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)  “The function of the pleadings in a motion
for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the
affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of
fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.”  (Juge
v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima
(1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-382.)
 
As to each claim as framed by the complaint, the
defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial burden of proof
by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to establish a defense.  (CCP § 437c(p)(2); Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.)  Courts “liberally construe the evidence in
support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning
the evidence in favor of that party.”  (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006)
39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
 
Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.  
To establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the
motion must produce substantial responsive evidence.  (Sangster
v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)
 
First Cause of Action: Disability Discrimination 
Government Code section 12940 provides that it is
unlawful for an employer to refuse to hire or employ a person; to discharge a
person from employment; or to discriminate against the person in compensation
or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment on the basis of physical
disability and medical condition.  (Govt.
Code, § 12940(a).)  
 
In
order to successfully assert a claim for discrimination, Plaintiff must satisfy
the requirements of the three-step McDonnell Douglas test.  (Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc. (2000) 24
Cal.4th 317, 354-55.)  Generally, a prima facie case requires showing that
(1) plaintiff was a member of a protected class; (2) she was qualified for the
position she sought or was performing competently in the position she held; (3)
plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination, demotion,
or denial of an available job; and (4) some other circumstance suggests
discriminatory motive.  (Id. at
355.) 
 
Once
a plaintiff has established a prima facie case, there is a “rebuttable” but
“legally mandatory” presumption of discrimination.  (Id. at 355.)  The burden then shifts to the defendant to
rebut the presumption by producing admissible evidence that the defendant’s
“action was taken for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason.”  (Id. at 355-356.) 
 
Finally,
if the defendant meets its burden, “the presumption of discrimination
disappears.”  (Id. at 356.)  The plaintiff must then show that the
defendant’s legitimate reason is merely pretext.  (Id.) 
“Pretext may be inferred from the timing of the discharge decision, the
identity of the decision-maker, or by the discharged employee's job performance
before termination.”  (Hanson v. Lucky
Stores, Inc. (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 215, 224.)  “Pretext may [also] be demonstrated by
showing that the proffered reason had no basis in fact, the proffered reason
did not actually motivate the discharge, or, the proffered reason was
insufficient to motivate discharge.”  (Id.) 
 
“When
seeking summary judgment or summary adjudication in an employment
discrimination case, the burdens established by the McDonnell Douglas
framework are altered. The ‘employer, as the moving party, has the initial
burden to present admissible evidence showing either that one or more elements
of plaintiff's prima facie case is lacking or that the adverse employment
action was based upon legitimate, nondiscriminatory factors.’ [Citation.]” (Zamora
v. Security Industry Specialists, Inc. (2021) 71 Cal.App.5th 1, 32.)  “If the employer satisfies its initial
burden, it will be entitled to summary [adjudication] unless the plaintiff
produces admissible evidence which raises a triable issue of fact material to
the defendant's showing.”  (Zamora,
supra, 71 Cal.App.5th at 32.)  “ ‘A
plaintiff's burden is ... to produce evidence that, taken as a whole, permits a
rational inference that intentional discrimination was a substantial motivating
factor in the employer's actions toward the plaintiff.’ [Citation.]” (Zamora,
supra, 71 Cal.App.5th 1, 58.) 
 
Here, by way of background, Plaintiff began her
employment with the County’s Probation Department (the “Department”) on
February 22, 2000 [Defendant’s Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (“UMF”)
# 1],
and was later promoted to Detention Services Officer (“DSO”) in 2003, where she
was assigned to Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall (“LPJH”) (UMF #2, 3).  As a DSO, Plaintiff was a sworn peace officer
with essential functions of supervising detained juveniles ranging anywhere
from seven (7) to twenty-one (21) years old and physically restraining
combative, aggressive and/or emotionally disturbed juveniles.  (UMF #4, 8-9) 

 
On
May 20, 2006, Plaintiff’s first work injury occurred.  (UMF # 28-29) Based on the medical
certifications of her primary care provider (“PCP”) that injury precluded her
from “restraining minors,” “lifting, grasping, or pulling over 5 pounds,” on
the basis of which her PCP “recommend[ed] a desk job”, such that the Department
memorialized a temporary Work Hardening Transitional Assignment Agreement (“WHA”)
that imposed workplace restrictions. 
(UMF # 30-31) On May 3, 2009, Plaintiff sustained another injury and on
March 30, 2010, the Department offered Plaintiff a “modified work” contract because
she was unable to perform essential functions of her job.  (UMF # 32-34, 36-38) Plaintiff continued
presenting medical certifications with identical workplace restrictions which triggered
numerous Interactive Process Meetings (“IPMs”); based on her PCP’s
certifications, and Plaintiff was assigned to various “post” assignments
monitoring the perimeter, which did not involve restraining minors.  (UMF #35, 41-49)  
Sometime
thereafter in July 2012, Plaintiff’s injuries were diagnosed as permanent, when
Dr. Angerman opined that “[Plaintiff’s] condition reached a permanent and
stationary status” (UMF # 77), making her incapable of performing the customary
duties of her job as a sworn peace officer. 
Defendant submits evidence that for over seven (7) months (i.e.,
September 2012 to May 2013), the Department had reasonably accommodated
Plaintiff by agreement, with numerous WHAs that imposed “post” assignments due
to her workplace restrictions not only prohibiting her from any involvement in
“physical altercations or restraining of minors,” but also, limited her to
“desk duty only.”  (UMF # 81-92)
 
An
IPM was held on May 28, 2013, where it was determined that Ms. Hernandez would
be placed on a Conditional Job Assignment pending retirement or alternative
reclassification, and during which the Department explained to her the LACERA process
of service retirement,  service-connected
disability retirement, as well as LACERA service-connected disability salary supplement.
 (UMF #93-94, 95, 97)  From October 1, 2013, through February 2014,
Plaintiff was assigned to a field post at LPJH pending her reassignment, while
she simultaneously presented medical certifications that continued to preclude any
“contact with combative minors,” and rated her Permanently Partially Disabled
(“PPD”) because Plaintiff cannot perform her usual and customary duties based
on the parameters of her work restrictions. 
(UMF # 99-104) 
 
From
2014 to 2017, Plaintiff was still employed as a DSO, not demoted, and did not experience
any loss in pay as the Department continued to accommodate Plaintiff with post
assignments, while concurrently exploring accommodation options that included
reassignment, to an available and open position that was within the parameters
of Plaintiff’s permanent workplace restrictions, i.e., that she could not
restrain minors; Plaintiff signed all Conditional Job Assignment agreements,
agreeing to her accommodating assignment.  (UMF #121) 
Plaintiff’s documented permanent work restrictions precluded her from
any full-duty assignment because she would not be able to physically intervene and
restrain, and there were no other reasonable accommodations available due to
the need to ensure safety for both youth offenders and staff with able-bodied personnel
to adequately respond to emergency situations. 
(UMF # 127)
 
On
January 9, 2018, the Department received information that a permanent
disability rating had been issued, which meant that the Department could no
longer consider Plaintiff for full duty vacancies because her physician
verified that she could not safely perform the various duties that she
previously could perform.  (UMF #
128)  On February 21, 2020, the
Department sent a letter to inform Plaintiff that effective March 9, 2020, her
classification would be changed from a DSO to an Intermediate Clerk (“IC”) and,
subsequently, Plaintiff was permanently assigned to the Contracts and Grants
Division as a reasonable accommodation.  (UMF
# 138-139)
 
In
her opposition, the evidence submitted by Defendant remains undisputed.  Notably, in Plaintiff’s Response and
Statement of Disputed Facts, Plaintiff’s responses to Defendant’s Separate
Statement consisted mainly of “undisputed”, and in those that she disputes,
Plaintiff failed to state and specify the nature of the dispute, as required by
California Rules of Court rule 3.1350(f). 
Thus, the evidence submitted by Defendant is largely undisputed.  
 
There
is no dispute that Plaintiff is a member of a protected class (disabled
employee), and that she was subjected to an adverse action (demotion); there is
no evidence, however, to suggest any link between Plaintiff’s transfer or
demotion and a discriminatory motive.  Neither
is there any evidence supporting any inference of discrimination or that
Plaintiff was treated differently from others similarly situated, or any other
evidence to suggest any discriminatory motive. 
Based on the evidence presented, it is apparent that due to Plaintiff’s
work-related injuries, she was unable to perform the duties of a DSO.  Thus, Plaintiff’s demotion was not based on a
discriminatory motive on account of her disability, but was instead based on
the fact that Plaintiff was no longer capable of performing her job (i.e.,
DSO), which required her to physically engage and restrain combative minors.  
 
An
employer has no duty to accommodate a disabled employee by making a temporary
accommodation permanent if doing so would require the employer to create a new
position just for the employee.  (Raine
v. City of Burbank (2006) 135 Cal. App. 4th 1215, 1227; see also, Quinn
v. City of Los Angeles (2000) 84 Cal. App. 4th 472, 482-484 [holding that
no disability discrimination existed for the Los Angeles City Police Officer
because he was not qualified for the job of sworn peace officer due to public safety
concerns when it was discovered that the employee had a hearing impairment]; Furtado
v. State Pers. Bd., (2013) 212 Cal. App. 4th 729, 746 [holding that a
correctional lieutenant who sustained permanent injuries was properly medically
demoted to a non-peace officer position, because he was unable to perform essential
job functions, including being able to disarm, subdue and restrain an inmate,
defend himself against an armed inmate and proficiently use a baton.]
 
Therefore,
Plaintiff cannot prevail on this cause of action because (1) Plaintiff cannot
present evidence suggesting discriminatory motive, and (2) Defendant had a
legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its conduct: Plaintiff’s inability to
perform the essential duties of her employment as a DSO due to permanent
medical workplace restrictions, resulting in her reassignment from a DSO
position to an Intermediate Clerk position. 
Defendant is therefore entitled to summary judgment on the first cause
of action of the SAC.
 
Third Cause of
Action: Retaliation
"[I]n
order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the FEHA, a
plaintiff must show (1) he or she engaged in a 'protected activity,' (2) the
employer subjected the employee to an adverse employment action, and (3) a
causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer's action.
[Citations.] Once an employee establishes a prima facie case, the employer is
required to offer a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for the adverse
employment action. [Citation.] If the employer produces a legitimate reason for
the adverse employment action, the presumption of retaliation '" 'drops
out of the picture, '"' and the burden shifts back to the employee to
prove intentional retaliation."  (Yanowitz
v. L'Oreal USA, Inc. (2005) 36 Cal.4th 1028, 1042.)  
 
Here,
as discussed above, Defendant has established and Plaintiff cannot dispute,
that Plaintiff’s transfer of assignment was due to Plaintiff’s inability to
perform the essential duties of  a DSO,
and was therefore not due to retaliation. 
Defendant is therefore entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff’s third
cause of action for retaliation.
 
Fourth Cause of
Action: Failure to Prevent Discrimination/Retaliation
“Failure
to prevent” is a derivative claim and must be predicated on an underlying claim
of discrimination or retaliation.  Claims
for failure to prevent discrimination fail as a matter of law when the
underlying violation did not actually occur. 
(Trujillo v. N. Cty. Transit Dist. (1998) 63 Cal. App. 4th 280,
289.)  Where there is no viable claim
under FEHA, Defendant cannot be liable for failure to prevent that action.  (Sneddon v. ABF Freight Sys. (S.D. Cal.
2007 489 F. Supp. 2d 1124, 1132–1133.)
 
Here,
since Plaintiff’s claims for discrimination and retaliation fail, there is
likewise no viable claim for failure to prevent the same.  Defendant
is therefore entitled to summary judgment on the fourth cause of action of the
SAC.
 
 
Fifth Cause of
Action: Violation of the Family Medical Leave Act / California Family Rights
Act
 
Similarly, this claim fails as Defendant has
demonstrated that Plaintiff’s inability to perform the functions of a DSO
position was the reason for her transfer to an administrative position, not
because she exercised her right to CFRA leave.   Defendant is therefore entitled to summary
judgment on the fifth cause of action of the SAC.
 
Sixth Cause of Action: Failure to Accommodate
Government
Code section 12940(m) provides that it is an unlawful employment practice
“[f]or an employer . . . to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known
physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee.” (Govt. Code, §
12940(m)(1).) 
 
“The
elements of a failure to accommodate a claim are ‘(1) the plaintiff has a
disability under the FEHA, (2) the plaintiff is qualified to perform the
essential functions of the position, and (3) the employer failed to reasonably
accommodate the plaintiff’s disability.’” 
(Swanson v. Morongo Unified School Dist. (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th
954, 969.)
 
            Here,
there is ample evidence to show that Defendant reasonably accommodated Plaintiff
when she was assigned to less arduous “post” assignments in accordance with the
work restrictions based on her attending physicians’ medical certifications.  Thus, Plaintiff’s claim under this cause of
action similarly fails. Defendant is therefore entitled to summary judgment on
the sixth cause of action of the SAC.
 
Seventh Cause of Action: Failure to Engage in an Interactive Process
Here, Defendant presented evidence that at least 15
IPM meetings were held over a ten-year period of time.  (UMF # 799, 814-819, 834, 839-840, 842, 856,
863, 865-869, 871-876, 882-885, 888-894, 895-897, 907, 908, 915)  At each IPM, assessments were done of
Plaintiff’s qualifications, work restrictions, and functional capacity related
to the essential functions of her job assignments.  (UMF #799, 814-819, 834, 839-840, 842, 856,
863, 865-869, 871-876, 882-885, 888-894, 895-897, 907, 908, 915)  Thus, Plaintiff cannot prevail on this claim.  Defendant is therefore entitled to summary
judgment on the seventh cause of action of the SAC.  
 
In
sum, the Court finds there is no triable issue of material fact as to any of
the causes of action remaining in the SAC and the County is entitled to
judgment on the SAC as a matter of law.
