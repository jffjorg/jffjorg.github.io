COMPLAINT
  FILED: JUNE 7, 2022
TRIAL
  DATE: FEBRUARY 24, 2025



 
I.      
BACKGROUND  
On January 3, 2022,
Plaintiff Daniel Abram (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against
Defendants SoulCycle, Inc. (“SoulCycle”), SoulCycle Beverly Hills, LLC
(“SoulCycle Beverly Hills”, Lindsay Warner, an individual (“Warner”), and Does
1 to 50 (collectively “Defendants”) alleging three causes of action: (1) negligence
and gross general negligence; (2) negligent hiring, retention, and supervision;
and (3) premises liability. The complaint arises from a January 5, 2020,
incident where Plaintiff allegedly sustained hearing loss after attending a
SoulCycle class.
On August 15, 2023, Defendants filed
the instant motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s complaint.
On June 6, 2024, the matter
was reassigned to the Honorable Judge Moskowitz in Department B of Van Nuys
Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024. 
On November 6, 2024,
Plaintiff filed their opposition. 
On November 14, 2024, Defendants
filed their reply. 
 
II.      
MOTION
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Defendants move for summary
judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication on Plaintiff’s complaint
on the grounds that Plaintiff’s claims have no merit, and that Plaintiff cannot
establish the necessary elements of his claim. (Motion p. 2:16-24.)
 
III.      
LEGAL
STANDARDS 
Burden on Summary Judgment or Summary Adjudication 
In reviewing a motion for
summary judgment, the Court must apply a three-step analysis: (1) identify the
issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has met
his or her initial burden; and (3) determine whether the opposition has
demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue.  (Hinesley
v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.)  “[T]he
initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that
there are no triable issues of material fact.”  (Scalf v. D.B. Log
Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant moving for
summary judgment or summary adjudication has met his or her burden of showing
that a cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more
elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a
complete defense to the cause of action.” (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §
437c(p)(2).) 
A moving defendant may
satisfy the initial burden to show that one or more elements cannot be
established by “presenting evidence that conclusively negates an element of the
plaintiff's cause of action or by relying on the plaintiff's factually devoid
discovery responses to show that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot
reasonably obtain, evidence to establish that element.” (Schmidt v.
Citibank, N.A. (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 1109, 1119; Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 856 [it is insufficient for the
defendant to merely point out the absence of evidence.]; Gaggero v. Yura
(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 884, 891.) “The defendant must present evidence,
typically in the form of factually devoid discovery responses, showing that
plaintiff does not have and cannot reasonably obtain evidence to support his or
her claim.” (Ibid.) 
Unless and until a defendant
meets that burden, the plaintiff has no burden to present controverting
evidence. (Consumer Cause, Inc. v. SmileCare (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 454,
468 [“There is no obligation on the opposing party . . . to establish anything
by affidavit unless and until the moving party has by affidavit stated facts
establishing every element . . . necessary to sustain a judgment in his
favor.”].) If a defendant fails to meet that burden, summary judgment must be
denied, even if the plaintiff fails to file an opposition and fails to proffer
any evidence. 
On the other hand, if the defendant
“has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.” (CCP § 437c(p)(2).) The plaintiff may not merely rely on
allegations or denials in its pleadings to show that a triable issue of
material fact exists, but instead “shall set forth the specific facts showing
that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the cause of action.” (Ibid.)
“If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary judgment should be granted.” (Avivi
v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.) 
 
IV.      
DISCUSSION 
Judicial Notice
         Defendants’
August 15, 2023, request for judicial notice is denied. Judicial notice of the
Court’s own case file is redundant as the Court can always review the case at
hand.
         Plaintiff’s
November 6, 2024, requests for judicial notice are granted pursuant to Cal.
Evid. Code § 452(c) and (d).
Evidentiary Objections 
Plaintiff’s November 6, 2024, evidentiary objection to Defendants’
entire notice of lodgment is overruled. Defendants timely filed their evidence
pursuant to CCP § 1005(b).
Defendants’ November 14, 2024, evidentiary objections are sustained
as to Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 25, 27, 28, 29, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 43, 45,
46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 53, 54, 55, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, and 65.
These objections are sustained for a multitude of reasons, inter alia, lacking
foundation (Evid. Code § 403(a)), improper legal conclusions (Evid. Code §
310); basing opinion on improper matter (Evid. Code § 801), irrelevance and
prejudice (Evid. Code §§ 350, 351, and 352.)
Defendants’ evidentiary objections are overruled as to Nos. 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 30, 31, 39,
40, 41, 42, 44, 52, and 66.
 
Defendant’s Burden 
Defendants meet their initial
burden. 
Defendants move for summary
judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication on Plaintiff’s complaint
on the grounds that Plaintiff’s claims have no merit, and that Plaintiff cannot
establish the necessary elements of his claim. (Motion p. 2:16-24.)
 
Assumption
of Risk
Defendants argue that all three of
Plaintiff’s causes of action fail as a matter of law because Plaintiff signed a
waiver of liability, containing an express assumption of risk clause, in order
to participate in the subject spin class.        
To prevail on his claims for
negligence, negligent hiring, retention and supervision, and premises
liability, Plaintiff must prove that Defendants owed Plaintiff a duty of care,
that Defendants breached the duty of care, and that the breach caused Plaintiff
to suffer damages. (Ortega v. Kmart Corp. (2001) 26 Cal.App.4th 1200,
1205.) A waiver and release agreement can relieve a defendant of its legal duty
to Plaintiff, thereby preventing liability for negligence. (Sweat v. Big
Time Auto Racing, Inc. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1304.) Waivers in recreational
sports or exercise facilities are generally enforceable as they do not impair
the public interest. (Cohen v. Five Brooks Stable (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th
1476, 1485.) Such waivers must be clear, unambiguous, and explicit in
expressing the parties’ intent. (Sweat v. Big Time Auto Racing, Inc. (2004)
117 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1304-1305.) As for scope, the releasee will not be held
liable for negligence “reasonably related to the object or purpose for which
the release was given”. (Paralift, Inc. v. Superior Court (1993) 23.
Cal.App.4th 748, 757.)
Here, Plaintiff signed a “New Rider
Waiver Form” as a condition of using the facilities at SoulCycle. (SoulCycle
Separate Statement of Facts “SC-SSF” No. 11; Abram Depo. at 75:8-83:20.) The
Waiver states the following:
“By signing up for and/or attending
classes, events, activities, and other programs and 
using the premises, facilities and
equipment, or any other location or venue where 
SoulCycle is providing services
(individually and/or collectively, the “Classes and 
Facilities” of SoulCycle Inc. and
its subsidiaries (collectively, ‘SoulCycle’), I hereby 
acknowledge on behalf of myself, my
heirs personal representatives and assigns, that 
there are certain inherent risks
and dangers in indoor cycling and exercise equipment in 
association with the Classes and
Facilities. I acknowledge that some of these risks cannot 
be eliminated regardless of the
care taken to avoid injuries. I also acknowledge that the 
specific risks vary from one
activity to another, but range from (1) minor injuries such as
scratches, bruises, and sprains:
(2) major injuries such as eye injury or loss of sight, joint 
or back injuries, heart attacks,
and concussions: and (3) catastrophic injuries including 
paralysis and death. I have read
and thoroughly understand the SoulCycle Bike Safety 
Instructions that are posed on
SoulCycle’s website www.soul-cycle.com), a hard copy of
which was also provided to me by
SoulCycle staff.
. . .
In consideration of being allowed
to participate in and access the Classes and Facilities. I  hereby
(1) agree to assume full responsibility for any and all injuries or damage
which 
are sustained or aggravated by me
in relation to the Classes and Facilities, (2) release, 
indemnify, and hold harmless
SoulCycle, its direct and indirect parent, subsidiary 
affiliate entities, and each of
their respective officers, directors, members, employees, 
representatives and agents . . .
from any and all responsibility, claims, actions, suits, 
procedures. costs, expenses,
damages, and liabilities to the fullest extent allowed by the 
law arising out of or in any way
related to participation in the Classes or use of the 
Facilities . . . The term of this
waiver is indefinite.”
(SC-SSF No. 13; Abram Depo. at
80:14-83:20.)
 
Plaintiff did not ask any questions
about his class. (Abram Depo. at 90:14-91:6; 101:16-102:18.) Ear plugs were
available on the check-in counter for participant use. (Abram Depo. at
111:16-112:17.) Plaintiff claims that, during the class, he recognized that the
music was too loud in volume. (Abram Depo. at 112:18-119:25.) Plaintiff’s
friend was on a bike next to him, yet Plaintiff did not attempt to seek help
from either the instructor or his friend during the class. (Abram Depo. at
112:18-119:25.) Plaintiff voluntarily continued with the class. (Abram Depo. at
112:18-119:25.)
Accordingly, Defendants meet their
initial burden. The burden now shifts to Plaintiff.
 
Plaintiff’s Burden 
Plaintiff argues that (1) the
Waiver is unenforceable as the parties’ agreement expressly designates New York
Law as controlling; and (2) even if the Waiver is enforceable, it does not
shield Defendants from liability for gross negligence; (3) the Waiver cannot
bar claims based on statutory violations; (4) the risk of hearing loss was not
reasonably foreseeable; and (5) assumption of risk cannot bar Plaintiff’s
claims because Defendants prevented Mr. Abrams from avoiding the risk.
 
Controlling Law
            Plaintiff
argues that the Waiver is unenforceable because, under New York law, liability
waivers for paid recreational activities are void as against public policy and
the Parties’ agreement explicitly designates New York law as controlling. (Plaintiff’s
Separate Statement of Facts (“P-SSF”) No. 1; Exhs. F and J [SoulCycle Terms and
Conditions]; see New York General Obligations Law § 5-326.) 
           California
courts enforce contractual choice of law provisions where they do not conflict
with a fundamental state policy or where California does not have a materially
greater interest than the chosen state. (Nedlloyd Lines B.V. v. Superior
Court (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 459, 466.) Additionally, choice of law
provisions should be enforced where there is a substantial relationship with
the chosen state. (McCann v. Foster Wheeler LLC (2010) 48 Cal.App.4th
68, 97-98.) Cal. Civ. Code § 1646 states that “a contract is to be interpreted
according to the law and usage of the place where it is performed; or, if it
does not indicate a place of performance, according to the law and usage of the
place where it is made.” (Civ. Code § 1646.) Here, the underlying incident
occurred at a SoulCycle studio in Beverly Hills, California. (SC-SSF Nos. 1, 7,
9, and 11; Abram Depo. at 75:8-83:20.) Plaintiff is a California resident.
Plaintiff signed the New Rider Waiver immediately before the January 5, 2020,
class. (Ibid.) The New Rider Waiver is separate from SoulCycle’s general
Terms and Conditions. Therefore, California law controls.
 
Statutory Violations
            
Plaintiff argues that the Waiver cannot bar claims based on statutory
violations, pointing to Civil Code § 1668, which prohibits contracts that
exempt a party from responsibility for “violation of law, whether willful or
negligent.” (Civ. Code § 1668.) Plaintiff alleges that SoulCycle knowingly
operated at sound levels violating the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (“OSHA”)’s maximum permissible exposure standards, citing 29
C.F.R. § 1910.95(g). However, Plaintiff’s evidence that the underlying class
exceeded these levels depends entirely on the impermissible speculations and
opinions of unrelated parties. (See Liberman Decl.; Marghzar Decl.; and
Terry Decl.) Once Defendant has met its initial burden, Plaintiff “shall set
forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists
as to the cause of action.” (Consumer Cause Inc., supra, 91 Cal.App.4th
at 98.)  Plaintiff has not set forth
specific facts showing a triable issue of material fact exists as to SoulCycle’s
statutory violations.
 
 
Gross Negligence
           Plaintiff
argues that the underlying class’s combination of excessive noise, darkness,
and physical restraint created “an extreme departure from the ordinary
relationship between instructor and student.” (Anderson v. Fitness Int’l,
LLC (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 867, 881.) Plaintiff further argues that
Defendants prevented Plaintiff from leaving by clipping him into the bike
without providing safety or detachment instructions on detachment. 
            Evidence
of mere negligence, or even multiple instances of negligence, does not create a
triable issue of gross negligence. Here, SoulCycle’s New Rider Waiver expressly
directed Plaintiff to their SoulCycle Bike Safety Instructions on their
website. (SC-SSF No. 13; Abram Depo. at 80:14-83:20.) Plaintiff claims that
Defendants prevented him from leaving the class, yet he did not try to seek
help from either the instructor or his friend, who was directly next to him.
(SC-SSF No. 22; Abram Depo. at 112:18-119:25.) 
Plaintiff fails to set forth specific facts showing that Defendants’
conduct created “an extreme departure from the ordinary relationship between
instructor and student.” (Anderson, supra, 4 Cal.App.5th at 881.) 
 
Foreseeable Risk
          Finally,
Plaintiff claims that, even if the Waiver is enforceable, his claims have
standing because permanent hearing damage is not a foreseeable risk of a
spin-cycle class. “[T]o exculpate [a party] from claims based on its own
negligence . . . the release must contain specific words clearly and explicitly
expressing such intent.” (Leon v. Family Fitness Center (#107) Inc. (1998)
61 Cal.App.4th 1227, 1234.) Where the circumstances under which a release is
executed can give rise to an ambiguity that is not apparent on the face of the
release, such ambiguity “should normally be construed against the drafter.” (Sweat
v. Big Time Auto Racing, Inc. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1306.) The New
Rider Waiver contemplates injuries related to the exercise itself, but it does
not contemplate hearing loss incurred by SoulCycle’s environment. Additionally,
hearing loss is not an inherent risk of exercising on a stationary bike.
Therefore, Plaintiff meets their burden showing a triable issue of material
fact as to whether hearing loss was a foreseeable risk of Defendants’ New Rider
Waiver.
 
V.      
CONCLUSION
             A triable issue of material fact exists as to
whether hearing loss was a foreseeable risk of SoulCycle’s class. Accordingly,
Defendants’ motion for summary judgment is DENIED. 
            Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
