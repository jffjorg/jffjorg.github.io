And here is a brief summary in English:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge on a motion for summary judgment by the defendants (Soulcycle Inc., Soulcycle Beverly Hills, LLC, and Lindsay Warner) in a lawsuit filed by plaintiff Daniel Abram. Abram claims he sustained hearing loss after attending a Soulcycle class on January 5, 2020. The defendants argue that Abram signed a waiver and release agreement before the class, which assumes the risk of injuries, and that hearing loss was not reasonably foreseeable. The judge rules that there is a triable issue of material fact as to whether hearing loss was a foreseeable risk, and therefore denies the defendants' motion for summary judgment.
