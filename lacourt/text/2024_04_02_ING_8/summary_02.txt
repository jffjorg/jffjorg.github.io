Significant Statements:
  - "The Court is inclined to continue the hearing on these discovery motions until the date the Court to which needed to postpone the IDC."
  - "The bottom line is that defense counsel cannot locate individual defendant Trass to get his input to help answer the discovery or to even get a signed verification, which if the situation continues would make an order compelling Trass to provide verified responses a mostly futile exercise."

Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge is inclined to continue the hearing on the discovery motions until May 9, 2024, when the IDC (Intersession Discovery Conference) will be held. The Judge notes that the Defendant's counsel is unable to locate the individual Defendant Trass to get his input on the discovery requests, and therefore, an order compelling Trass to provide verified responses would be mostly futile. The Judge is currently in the midst of a third back-to-back-to-back trial and is not able to hold the IDC on the originally scheduled date.
