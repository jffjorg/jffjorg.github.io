And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion filed by the plaintiff, Shane Shahab Satey, seeking attorneys' fees and costs in the amount of $30,516.70. The defendant, Tesla Motors, Inc., opposed the motion, arguing that the plaintiff's attorneys' fees are unreasonable. The judge granted the plaintiff's motion in part, awarding fees and costs in the amount of $20,205.70. The judge's ruling is based on the Song-Beverly Act, which allows prevailing parties to recover attorneys' fees. The judge applied the "lodestar" method to calculate the attorneys' fees, considering the reasonable hourly rate and the number of hours worked. The judge reduced the hours billed by the plaintiff's attorneys in certain areas, such as reviewing repair orders and conducting a vehicle inspection. The judge also considered the plaintiff's request for a multiplier enhancement, but denied it, citing the lack of significant risk taken by the plaintiff's attorneys.
