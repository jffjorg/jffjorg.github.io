And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by the Moving Defendants (American Towers, LLC and GTP Structures I, LLC) is sustained. The judge finds that the Plaintiffs (Oliver Kabilka and Phillip Kabilka) have failed to allege the existence of a duty owed by the Moving Defendants to the Plaintiffs. The judge concludes that the Plaintiffs have not shown how the Moving Defendants owed them a duty, and that the Rooftop Lease Agreement between Shores Barrington LLC and GTP does not impose a duty on American Towers. The judge also finds that the mere act of entering into the Lease does not suffice to show that the Moving Defendants owed a duty to the Plaintiffs. The judge notes that the Plaintiffs do not allege anything in the Lease that would give rise to a duty, and that the Plaintiffs were not using the rooftop area when the alleged injuries occurred. The judge holds that the Moving Defendants did not owe a duty to the Plaintiffs and that the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.
