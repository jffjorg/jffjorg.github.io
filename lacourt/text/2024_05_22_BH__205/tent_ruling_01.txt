  Case Number:  22SMCV01934    Hearing Date:   May 22, 2024    Dept:  205 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205  LEO DAVID,    Plaintiff, v.  AURICE VELOSO,   Defendant.    Case No.:  22SMCV01934 C/W    22SMCV01934 [Lead Case]     Hearing Date:  May 22, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   XCVI, LLC’S MOTIONS TO COMPEL    RESPONSES TO FORM    INTERROGATORIES-GENERAL (SET    ONE), FORM INTERROGATORIES-   EMPLOYMENT (SET ONE), SPECIAL    INTERROGATORIES (SET ONE),    REQUESTS FOR ADMISSIONS (SET    ONE), AND REQUESTS FOR    PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS (SET    ONE) AURICE VELOSO,    Cross-Complainant, v.  LEO DAVID, et al.,   Defendants.          BACKGROUND This case arises from an employment dispute.  Aurice Veloso was a caregiver for Leo David and his late wife, Ruth David.  David alleges Veloso stole monies and personal property and engaged in financial and physical elder abuse.   Meanwhile, Veloso has brought her own claims of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.  Veloso alleges that David asked her to sleep with him in exchange for improved working conditions and other financial incentives including a house, a car and tuition.  Veloso further alleges that despite working around the clock, she was not compensated for overtime or provided rest and meal breaks.  David then terminated Veloso when she opposed his alleged discrimination and harassment.   David paid Veloso’s wages through various companies he owned, including XCVI, LLC (“XCVI”) and Construction for Less, Inc. (CFL).  Veloso alleges these corporate defendants ratified and adopted the conduct of David. This hearing is on XCVI’s five motions to compel responses to requests for admissions, special interrogatories, form interrogatories-general, form interrogatories-employment, and requests for production of documents.  XCVI argues that Veloso failed to respond to the requests and accordingly, has waived all objections.  XCVI also seeks monetary sanctions on the ground Veloso has misused the discovery process by failing to timely respond.  Veloso submitted oppositions to these motions, but they were filed late and without leave to file them late.  In addition, XCVI points out that Veloso once again failed to cooperate to submit a joint statement in connection with these motions.  Nevertheless, the Court elects to consider Veloso’s oppositions and her “Responses” to the “Joint Statement” filed by XCVI. LEGAL STANDARD  A motion to compel an initial response can be made on the ground that a party did not serve a timely response to interrogatories or a demand to produce. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (a) [demand to produce]; see¿Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404 (Sinaiko).)  To establish this ground, a movant must show: (1) proper service; (2) expiration of the deadline for the initial response, 30 days after service or on date agreed to by parties, and (3) no timely response.  (See¿Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.080, 2030.090, 2030.260, 2031.040, 2031.260, 2031.300.) Where the court grants a motion to compel responses, sanctions shall be imposed against a party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel, unless the person or entity acted with substantial justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.90, 2033.280, subds. (c);¿Cal. Rule of Court, rule 3.1348.)  In addition, the court may award sanctions for any misuse of discovery process.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2023.010¿and¿2023.030.)  A failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse of the discovery process.  (Code Civ. Proc, § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿ Where a party fails to timely respond to a request for admission, the propounding party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party who failed to respond waives any objections to the demand, unless the court grants them relief from the waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).) The court shall grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) Where a party fails to provide a timely response to requests for admission, “[i]t is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  While delayed responses may avoid a motion to deem admitted, they will not avoid monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280 subd. (c); Gonzales v. Harris, 2021 Cal. Super. LEXIS 29267 at *6 (even if delayed responses are served, sanctions are mandatory because the motion had to be brought, regardless of whether it is ultimately denied because responses are served before the hearing).)  MEET AND CONFER  On March 27, 2024, XCVI’s counsel sent Veloso a letter addressing Veloso’s failure to respond to XCVI’s discovery requests.  (Ex. 7 to McKeon Decl.)  The letter asked Veloso to produce substantive answers (without objections) and produce any responsive documents by the close of business on April 1, 2024.  Veloso did not provide responses or responsive documents by that date.  (McKeon Decl. ¶9.)   On March 29, 2024, Veloso’s counsel claimed she was not served with the discovery requests.  XCVI has an affidavit from the person who personally served Veloso’s counsel’s office with the discovery requests.  (Ex. 8 to McKeon Decl.)  Veloso’s counsel then claimed the parties agreed to e-mail service only.  XCVI maintains that counsel agreed to accept service by e-mail but the parties did not agree that documents must be served by e-mail.  In any event, on April 3, 2024, XCVI’s counsel provided Veloso’s counsel with courtesy copies of the discovery requests by e-mail.  (McKeon Decl. ¶14.)  Veloso still did not respond to the discovery requests.  (Motion at 4:16-17.)   The parties participated in an informal discovery conference on May 1, 2024 and May 3, 2024.  Ahead of the IDC, the parties submitted a joint statement.  (Ex. 6 to McKeon Decl.)  In that statement, Veloso’s counsel stated: “By the time of [the May 1 IDC, Veloso] will have responded to the discovery at issue[.]”  (Id. at 5:23-24.)  However, Veloso still has not responded to the discovery requests.  (Motion at 5:22-23.)  The court considered the discovery issues at the IDC and granted XCVI permission to file its five motions to compel.  (McKeon Decl. ¶14.)   On these facts, the Court concludes XCVI has sufficiently complied with its meet and confer obligations.   DISCUSSION  On February 20, 2024, XCVI personally served written discovery requests on Veloso.  (Exs. 1-5 to McKeon Decl.)  Veloso’s responses were due March 21, 2024.  Veloso did not respond within the deadline, and therefore, waived her objections.  (Sinaiko, 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403 (a party who “fails to serve a timely response to the discovery request waives any objection to the request, including one based on privilege or the protection of the attorney work product”).)     Veloso argues that the discovery requests were not served by e-mail, in violation of the parties’ e-mail service agreement.  The agreement states that “all service documents to Plaintiff [shall] be served through electronic service at the following email addresses”. (Ex. 1 to Abrolat Decl.)  XCVI responds that the agreement only requires counsel to accept service by e-mail; it does not confine the parties to serve documents only by e-mail.  The Court need not resolve this dispute because XCVI served Veloso by e-mail on April 3, 2024, making her deadline to respond May 6, 2024.  (Ex. 11 to McKeon Decl.)  She served no response by that date, either. Veloso never addresses this argument in her Opposition.   Veloso argues the requests are excessively burdensome and harassing, and they are also duplicative of discovery answered long ago.  They purportedly mirror and seek the same information previously served by David to Veloso on March 20, 2023, to which Veloso claims she provided complete and verified responses in October 2023. If that were so, then Veloso should have served objections to the requests on those grounds.  Alternatively, if indeed the discovery was truly duplicative and Veloso served code-compliant responses to the prior requests, then Veloso could have served the same responses.  Instead, Veloso chose not to respond at all, and her objections are therefore waived.  Additionally, given the breadth and scope of Veloso’s allegations, it’s not apparent to the Court that XCVI’s discovery is disproportionate to those allegations. Veloso also relies on an IDC Minute Order which states “Plaintiff [David] will also withdraw duplicative interrogatories/requests.”  (Ex. 4 to Abrolat Decl.)  Veloso argues that pursuant to this order, XCVI was required to withdraw any discovery requests that were duplicative of prior requests served by David.  But this order does not save Veloso.  It was not directed to XCVI, and in any event, the Court’s order did not revive waived objections.   Accordingly, the Court grants XCVI’s motions to compel initial responses.  Veloso is ordered to provide responses without objections to the form interrogatories-general, form interrogatories-employment, requests for production of documents and special interrogatories within 10 calendar days of this Order.  Veloso is deemed to have admitted the requests for admissions.   XCVI also seeks sanctions in the amount of $13,750.  The Court concludes sanctions are mandatory as to Veloso’s failure to timely respond to the requests for admissions.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  The Court also concludes sanctions are warranted as to the other requests given Veloso’s misuse of the discovery process in failing to timely respond.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2023.010¿and¿2023.030.)   In determining the appropriate amount of sanctions, the Court starts with the lodestar which is the reasonable hourly rate multiplied by the reasonable hours spent. (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1096; see also Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)  XCVI’s counsel has been practicing since 2014.  The Court concludes that his hourly rate of $550 is a reasonable rate for attorneys in the prevailing market with 10 years experience.  (Gatdula v. CRST Int'l, Inc. (C.D. Cal. Aug. 26, 2015) 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 193440¿*31 (finding hourly rate of $550 for lawyer with 10 years experience was reasonable in 2015); Elder v. Nat'l Conf. of Bar Examiners (N.D. Cal. Sept. 12, 2011) 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102205, at *14, n.4¿(finding $535 per hour to be a reasonable rate for an attorney with eight years experience in 2011).)¿ As to the reasonable hours spent, XCVI’s counsel attests he has spent 15 hours preparing the five motions to compel, conducting research in support of the motions, preparing the joint statements, preparing his declaration and preparing the proposed order.  He expects to spend another 10 hours preparing the replies and preparing for and attending the hearing.  The Court concludes these hours are excessive.  The five motions are largely identical and should have required little work to conform to each discovery request.  The Court concludes that 12 hours is more reasonable, and awards sanctions in the amount of $6,600 jointly and severally against Veloso and her counsel.   The Court denies without prejudice XCVI’s request for evidentiary and/or terminating sanctions, noting that there is a motion on calendar on June 6, 2024 seeking similar relief. CONCLUSION  For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS XCVI’s motions to compel responses to requests for admissions, special interrogatories, form interrogatories-general, form interrogatories-employment, and requests for production of documents.  Veloso is required to respond to the special interrogatories, form interrogatories-general, form interrogatories-employment and requests for production within 10 calendar days of this Order.  Veloso is deemed to have admitted the requests for admissions.  The Court also awards sanctions in the amount of $6,600 against Veloso and her counsel, jointly and severally.    IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: May 22, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B.
