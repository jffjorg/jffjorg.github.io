And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Justin J. Eballar, counsel for plaintiff Antoinette Holmes, to be relieved as counsel. The motion is unopposed, and the judge has found that it is both procedurally and substantively proper. The motion was filed due to continued difficulties in communication between Counsel and the client, which renders it unreasonably difficult for Counsel to carry out the representation effectively. The judge has granted the motion, and Counsel must serve the signed order on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the action, and file proof of service within 10 days.
