And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a motion to seal the version of the Complaint currently on file, which contains financial information that should be redacted. The parties have submitted a stipulated joint application to seal the record and permit the filing of the redacted version. The Judge has reviewed the parties' memorandum and declaration in support of the motion and finds that the Defendant has an overriding interest in the financial information that overrides the public's interest in accessing that information. The Judge grants the parties' application and orders the parties to confer and cooperate with the Clerk of the Court to implement the Court's orders.
