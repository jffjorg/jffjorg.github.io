And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Radford Studio Center, LLC's motion for a protective order or to quash the subpoenas propounded by Plaintiffs Joanne Osorio-Wu and Zoila Osorio on third parties Marvel Studios LLC and the Walt Disney Company. The Plaintiffs are seeking documents regarding inspections of the subject premises, Stage 3, and the subject incident. The Defendant argues that the requests are overbroad and unduly burdensome, but the judge disagrees, finding that the requests are reasonable and that the Defendant has not met its burden of proof to demonstrate that it would be unduly burdensome for Marvel and Disney to produce the documents as requested. The judge orders Marvel and Disney to comply with the subpoenas within 30 days of notice of this order.
