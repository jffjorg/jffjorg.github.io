And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The plaintiff, Poursalimi, demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant, Andrew Williams, was personally served at his Florida residence. The defendant's summary denial of service was not enough to overcome the declaration of the registered process server, Natasha Caplan. Additionally, the court has specific personal jurisdiction over the defendant because of their operation of a law firm in Los Angeles, and the case arises from that representation.
