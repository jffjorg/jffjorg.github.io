MOTION:                  Motion
to Quash Service of Process
HEARING DATE:   5/8/2023

 
Legal
Standard
 

“A defendant . . . may serve and file a notice of
motion for one or more of the following purposes: (1) To quash service of summons on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction of the court over him or her . . ..” (CCP § 418.10(a).)
A court lacks jurisdiction over a party if there has not been proper service of
process. (Ruttenberg v. Ruttenberg (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 801, 808.)
“When a motion to quash is properly brought,
the burden of proof is placed upon the plaintiff to establish the facts of
jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.” (Aquila, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 556, 568.)  The plaintiff has “the burden of proving the facts that did
give the court jurisdiction, that is the facts requisite to an effective
service.”  (Coulston v. Cooper (1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 866, 868;
see also Elkman v. National States Ins. Co. (2009) 173
Cal.App.4th 1305, 1312-13 [“Where a nonresident defendant challenges
jurisdiction by way of a motion to quash, the plaintiff bears the burden of
establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that minimum contacts exist
between the defendant and the forum state to justify imposition of personal
jurisdiction.”].)  
 
Analysis
 
Defendants The Williams Law Group and Andrew Williams specially
appear and move to quash service of summons.
 
              “[C]ompliance
with the statutory procedures for service of process is essential to establish
personal jurisdiction. [Citation.]” (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994)
24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444.) “[T]he filing of a proof of service creates a
rebuttable presumption that the service was proper” but only if it “complies
with the statutory requirements regarding such proofs.” (Id. at
1441-1442.)
 
Here, Plaintiff demonstrates by a preponderance that
Defendants were personally served at the individual defendant's Florida
residence. Defendant's summary denial of service does not overcome the
declaration of the registered process server, Natasha Caplan. In her
declaration, Ms. Caplan served the papers on an individual who identified
himself as Andrew Williams and matched Mr. Williams’ confirmed identity.  
 
Furthermore, the Court has specific personal jurisdiction
over Defendants because of their operation of a law firm in Los Angeles, and
the case arises from that representation. 
 
Accordingly,
the motion to quash is DENIED.
