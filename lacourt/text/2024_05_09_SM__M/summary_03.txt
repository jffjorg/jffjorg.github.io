Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to compel further responses from the plaintiff regarding Form Interrogatories Nos. 2.2, 6.4(d), 6.5(e), 6.7, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4(d), 50.1, 50.2, and 50.5. The plaintiff failed to provide a response to FROG no. 2.2, which asks for the birthday and place of birth. The plaintiff provided mostly compliant supplemental responses. The court orders the plaintiff to provide a further response within 10 days. The judge also grants sanctions in the amount of $1,100.00 against the plaintiff and their counsel, Hamid Soleimanian, for failing to provide a timely response. The court finds that the imposition of full sanctions would be unjust due to the plaintiff's mostly compliant supplemental responses.
