MOTION:                  Motion to Amend Judgment to Add Judgment Debtor
HEARING DATE:   5/8/2024

 
Legal
Standard
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 187, a trial court has jurisdiction to modify a judgment
to add additional judgment debtors. Section 187 grants every court the power to
use all means to carry its jurisdiction into effect, even if those processes
are not set out in the code. Section 187 states: “When jurisdiction is, by the
Constitution or this Code, or by any other statute, conferred on a Court or
judicial officer, all the means necessary to carry it into effect are also
given; and in the exercise of this jurisdiction, if the course of proceeding be
not specifically pointed out by this Code or the statute, any suitable process
or mode of proceeding may be adopted which may appear most conformable to the
spirit of this code.” (CCP § 187.) 
 
Judgments are typically “amended to
add additional judgment debtors on the grounds that a person or entity is the
alter ego of the original judgment debtor. This is an equitable procedure based
on the theory that the court is not amending the judgment to add a new
defendant but is merely inserting the correct name of the real defendant. ‘Such
a procedure is an appropriate and complete method by which to bind new
individual defendants where it can be demonstrated that in their capacity as
alter ego of the corporation they in fact had control of the previous
litigation, and thus were virtually represented in the lawsuit.’” (NEC
Electronics Inc. v. Hurt (1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 772, 778;
see also Greenspan v. LADT, LLC (2010) 191
Cal.App.4th 486, 508.) 
 
To prevail
on a motion to amend judgment to add an alter ego of an original judgment
debtor, the judgment creditor must show, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that: (1) the parties to be added as judgment debtors had control of the
underlying litigation and were virtually represented in that proceeding; (2)
there is such a unity of interest and ownership that the separate personalities
of the entity and the owners no longer exist; and (3) an inequitable result
will follow if the acts are treated as those of the entity alone. (Highland
Springs Conference & Training Center v. City of Banning (2016)
244 Cal.App.4th 267, 280.) 
 
“In
determining whether there is a sufficient unity of interest and ownership, the
court considers many factors, including the commingling of funds and assets of
the two entities, identical equitable ownership in the two entities, use of the
same offices and employees, disregard of corporate formalities, identical
directors and officers, and use of one as a mere shell or conduit for the
affairs of the other.” (Highland Springs Conference & Training Center v.
City of Banning (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 267, 280, internal
quotations omitted.) “The court is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing
on a motion to amend judgment, but may rule on the motion based solely on
declarations and other written evidence.” (Ibid.) 
 
 
 
 
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiffs Steve Orenberg and Julie
Toman move to amend, nunc pro tunc, the judgment rendered in this action
against Defendant/Judgment Debtor Brett Livingstone Strong, by adding as
judgment debtors Jackson-Strong Alliance, LLC (“JSA”) and Stason Strong. (CCP
section 187.) The motion is unopposed.
 
Control by third parties has been
found in a variety of circumstances. (See Alexander v. Abbey of the Chimes
(1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 39, 46 [control found where nonparty alter ego hired
counsel for corporation, corporate counsel primarily dealt with alter ego, alter
ego was kept fully informed of the suit and where alter ego helped draft
documents for the litigation]; Oyakawa v. Gillett (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th
628, 631, [control not found where unnamed wife had no control over the
litigation, and the only basis for her liability was community property
interest in LLC]; Toho-Towa Co., Ltd. v. Morgan Creek Productions, Inc.
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 1096, 1109 [control found where three business entities
were a single business enterprise with integrated resources; production company
dominated the finances; the affiliated companies had no “mind, will or
existence” of their own but were conduits of the production company; all
entities were owned by same person who was the sole decisionmaker of the
enterprise]; Butler America, LLC v. Aviation Assur. Co., LLC (2020) 55 Cal.App.5th
136, 146-147 [owner controlled the judgment debtor and the related entities, where
the companies shared the same office and employees; owner used the intermingled
funds between the entities; same entity funded settlement and defense; and the owner
did not observe corporate formalities].)
 
While the Court believes Plaintiffs
have established the second and third prongs for amendment, Plaintiffs have not
demonstrated that proposed judgment debtors, JSA and Stason Strong, had actual
control of the litigation. Plaintiffs attempt to impute all of Defendant Strong’s
actions during the litigation onto JSA and Stason Strong. Plaintiffs highlight evidence
that Strong had an ability to bind JSA. Even so, Plaintiffs do not cite any
evidence that Strong exercises actual control or ownership over JSA, rather
than simply being an agent of JSA. More importantly, this type of control is
not what needs to be shown. Plaintiffs need to show that Stason Strong or JSA controlled
the litigation, not just Defendant Strong’s agency with JSA. 
 
Instead of showing
Stason Strong or JSA’s control of the litigation, Plaintiffs focus on Defendant
Strong’s control over JSA. For instance, Defendant Strong always claimed to own
and control the Artwork, but now claims that he did not own the Artwork--instead
JSA owned it and he was only acting as a broker trying to sell it. (RJN, Ex. P
at 5:3–17.) This was the first time Defendant Strong made the claim to
Plaintiffs that he did not own the Jackson Artwork. (Orenberg Decl. ¶ 13.) Also,
Strong had authority to act on behalf of JSA because he regularly signed
documents on behalf of JSA, apparently had access to and rights to withdraw and
deposit money into JSA bank accounts, and indeed routinely withdrew money for
his own personal use from these accounts. (Wolfe Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. 21 [Mr.
Strong’s Judgment Debtor Exam] at pp. 34, 97, 117- 18, 143; RJN Ex. D [Mr.
Strong’s Jun. 28, 2019 Motion] at pp. 56-58.) For example, Plaintiff was
instructed to wire money to Mr. Strong via JSA’s account. (See Ex. 8; cf. RJN
Ex. D [Mr. Strong’s Jun. 28, 2019 Motion] at pp. 56, 60.) JD Strong used funds to
pay for rent and living expenses (Id. at pp. 88- 89, 118-20), to pay for
alimony payments and his ex-wife’s attorney fees (Id. at pp. 49-50; 172-75), to
pay for parking tickets (Id. at p. 134), to pay his attorneys, (Id. at pp. 54-
55, 145-48, 150-54, 160-61, 168-69), to make car payments, (Id. at pp. 28-30),
and for the Hangar, (Id. at pp. 41-43, 68, 122-31, 145-49, 162-63). Defendant
Strong used the same address as JSA, which is the Hangar where they stored the
Artwork. (RJN Ex. F [Mr. Strong’s Aug. 9, 2021 Decl.] at 4:1-2.) Strong had
apparent control over the Jackson Artwork and the Hangar, both of which are now
allegedly owned by JSA LLC. (Orenberg Decl. ¶ 4; RJN Ex. A [Mr. Strong’s Oct.
19, 2016 Decl.] at 15:14–28.) Defendant Strong also had valuations of the
Artwork done on behalf of JSA. (Orenberg Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. 6 at p. 1, Ex. 7 at p.
1.)
 
However, this evidence
demonstrates that Defendant Strong had permission from his son Stason Strong,
the member-manager of JSA to withdraw money from the JSA account, and that his
son has since ended Defendant Strong’s access to the JSA account. This suggests
that Stason Strong actually retains management and control over JSA. This does
not suggest that Stason or JSA controlled, or even knew of, this litigation. At
best, this demonstrates one indicia of control over the litigation: that JSA
apparently paid for defense of this litigation. This fact alone does not show it
is more likely than not that JSA actually controlled the litigation. The Court cannot impose liability
against Stason Strong absent stronger evidence of JSA/Stason Strong’s control
over the litigation. While the court would agree that Defendant Strong
has committed fraud, and JSA/Stason Strong apparently aided this fraud, the
Court still cannot add a judgment debtor under such circumstances. 
 
As such, the Court is concerned that any
amendment adding JSA or Stason Strong to this judgment would be void for lack
of due process. (See Motores De Mexicali, S. A. v. Superior Court In and ForLos Angeles
County (1958) 51 Cal.2d 172, 175-176 [“[The
individual defendants] in no way participated in the defense of the basic
action against [the corporation]. [The individual defendants] did not have
attorneys subsidized by them appearing and defending the action against
the corporation now alleged to be their alter ego. Instead, the judgment was
entered against [the corporation] strictly by default…[¶]…To summarily add [the
individual defendants] to the judgment heretofore running only against [the
corporation], without allowing them to litigate any questions beyond their
relation to the allegedly alter ego corporation would patently violate [the
Fourteenth Amendment]”]; See also Cal. Prac. Guide Enf. J. & Debt (2023)
Amending Judgment to Add Nonparty Alter Egos as Judgment Debtors, Ch. 6G-15; Nelson
v. Adams USA, Inc. (2000) 529 US 460, 466-468, 472 [absent notice and
proper opportunity to respond, an amendment to a judgment imposing liability on
a third party (not alter ego) violates that party's due process rights].)
 
Even if the Court found that Defendant
Strong has control over JSA, and that led to JSA controlling the underlying litigation,
Plaintiffs do not show that there is a unity of interest and ownership
between JSA and Defendant Strong. Plaintiffs essentially seek to hold JSA
liable as an alter ego of Defendant Strong, and then hold Stason Strong liable
as an alter ego of JSA. To do so, the Court would have to reverse-pierce the corporate veil to impose
Defendant Strong’s liability against JSA, then again pierce the corporate veil
to impose JSA’s liability onto Stason Strong as an alter ego.
 
Reverse veil piercing is similar
to traditional veil piercing in that it involves a court disregarding the
separation between an individual and a business entity when the ends of justice
so require. (Curci Investments, LLC v. Baldwin (2017)
14 Cal.App.5th 214, 221.) “Rather than seeking to hold an individual
responsible for the acts of an entity, reverse veil piercing seeks to
satisfy the debt of an individual through the assets of an entity of which the
individual is an insider.” (Ibid.) As with traditional veil
piercing, there is no precise litmus test; the trial court should, at a
minimum, evaluate the same factors as are employed in traditional veil
piercing, as well as whether the judgment creditor has any plain, speedy, and
adequate remedy at law. (Id.; see Blizzard Energy, Inc. v. Schaefers (2021)
71 Cal.App.5th 832, 840-841 [trial court added LLC to judgment against 50%
member; appellate court reversed and remanded to consider whether adding LLC
would be inequitable to judgment debtor's wife, who had other 50% interest,
when they had been separated for over 20 years].)
 
Critically, Plaintiffs does not cite
evidence that Defendant Strong has any equitable interest or ownership in JSA. Plaintiffs
presents evidence that Defendant Strong owned half of the Jackson
Artwork through a different entity, JSA Partnership, which acquired the
remaining 50% interest around Michael Jackson’s death in late June 2009. (RJN
Ex. B [Mr. Strong’s Jan. 18, 2018 Decl.] at 5:16-21; RJN Ex. E [Mr. Strong’s
Jul. 18, 2019 Trial Brief] at 2:11-13, 3:4-5, 5:17, 6:6-7; RJN Ex. D [Mr.
Strong’s Jun. 28, 2019 Decl.] at 22:1-9, 2:22-24.) Otherwise, Plaintiffs do not
evidence Defendant Strong’s ownership of JSA LLC. Again, Stason Strong is the
managing member of JSA LLC and controls JSA. (RJN Ex. H.) Stason Strong was
allegedly aware of and sanctioned Defendant Strong’s continued control over and
use of the Jackson Artwork to collateralize his personal loans, among
other things. (Orenberg Decl., ¶ 8; Wolfe Decl ¶ 4a, Ex. 17.) 
 
The Court would also note that there are
adequate remedies at law for recovery against JSA and Stason Strong. Plaintiffs
could pursue a separate action against JSA and Stason Strong, either for a
statutory fraudulent transfer claim, or other common law cause of action based
on conspiracy or aiding and abetting Defendant Strong’s fraud. (See Macedo
v. Bosio Revocable Trust (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1044, 1051 [voidable
conveyance statutes are not exclusive remedy for fraudulent transfer].) Further,
post-judgment mechanisms may exist to enforce the judgment against the property
without resorting to adding judgment debtors. (See, e.g., Civ. Code §
3439.07(c); Whitehouse v. Six Corp., (1995) 40 Cal. App. 4th 527, 532 [a
plaintiff who suspects that the defendant-debtor has fraudulently transferred
assets in order to become judgment proof may also enforce its claim against the
transferred property by way of a writ of attachment].)
 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.
