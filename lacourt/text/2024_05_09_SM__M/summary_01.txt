And here is the summary in English text:

The case involves a motion to amend a judgment to add Jackson-Strong Alliance, LLC (JSA) and Stason Strong as judgment debtors. The motion is unopposed. The court finds that Plaintiffs have established the second and third prongs for amendment, but not the first prong, which requires showing that the parties to be added as judgment debtors had control of the underlying litigation. The court finds that Defendant Strong had control over JSA, but not that JSA controlled the litigation. The court also finds that Stason Strong, the managing member of JSA, had control over JSA. The court denies the motion, holding that it would be void for lack of due process and that Plaintiffs have adequate remedies at law.
