```
And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to set aside the default and default judgment. The defendant, Olena Tarasyuk, claims that she was never served with the complaint or any other documentation regarding the lawsuit, and only became aware of the lawsuit when a member of the apartment complex management told her she had been sued and would be evicted. However, the judge finds that the service of summons via posting and mailing resulted in actual notice, as evidenced by the proof of service on file and the fact that the defendant was sent notices from the court and counsel regarding the case status. Additionally, the writ of possession has already been executed, rendering the motion moot.
