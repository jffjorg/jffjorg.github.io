And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants' motion to quash the service of summons and complaint. The plaintiff, Lloyd Albert Payne Jr., filed a complaint against Avis Budget Group, Inc. and Joseph Feraro on November 1, 2023. The defendants moved to quash the service of summons and complaint, citing several deficiencies in the proof of service, including that the plaintiff served the papers himself, which is improper, and that the proof of service does not specify the person served. The court finds that the service is improper and grants the defendants' motion.
