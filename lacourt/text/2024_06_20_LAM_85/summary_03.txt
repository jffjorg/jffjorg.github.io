And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a dispute between Beyder and DSS regarding the denial of protective supervision. Beyder argues that the ALJ misapplied the law and that the ALJ's findings are not supported by the weight of the evidence. Beyder points out that Daughter testified she did not put locks on doors to prevent Beyder from leaving, which contradicts the ALJ's conclusion that Daughter never had to stop Beyder from leaving. Beyder also argues that the ALJ did not consider what would happen if Beyder were left alone. DSS argues that the case Maryann L. v. Johnson (2022) is not relevant because it is an unpublished trial court opinion with no precedential value. The Judge notes that the ALJ's decision is based on the evidence presented, and the Judge will review the ALJ's decision.
