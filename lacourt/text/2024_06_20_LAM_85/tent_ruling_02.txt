 Case Number:  23STCP03919    Hearing Date:   June 20, 2024    Dept:  85 
 
Klaudia Beyder v. Kim Johnson, 23STCP03919
 
Tentative decision on petition for writ of mandate:
denied



 
 
 
Petitioner Klaudia Beyder (“Beyder”) seeks a writ of
mandate directing Respondent Kim Johnson, in her official capacity as the
Director of the California Department of Social Services (“DSS”), to set aside
an administrative decision regarding the denial of Beyder’s eligibility for
protective supervision as a component of in-home supportive services (“IHSS”). 
The court has read and considered the moving papers,
opposition, and reply, and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
1. Petition
Petitioner Beyder commenced this proceeding on October 24,
2023, alleging one cause of action for administrative mandamus pursuant to CCP
section 1094.5 and Welfare and Institutions Code section 10962.  The verified Petition alleges in pertinent
part as follows.
Petitioner Beyder is an 85-year-old, low-income woman
diagnosed with dementia and other disabilities. 
As Beyder’s conditions worsened, she began to elope from her home.  She also engaged in other potentially
dangerous activities such as turning on the stove and then leaving the room. 
On July 19, 2021, Los Angeles County (“County”) sent Beyder
a Notice of Action (“NOA”) informing
her that she was approved for 193 IHSS hours per month effective August 1, 2021.  The County gave her zero hours for protective
supervision.  
On August 20, 2021, Beyder submitted an Assessment of Need
for Protective Supervision for IHSS Form SOC 821, in which her physician
recommended that Beyder be given 24 hour-a-day protective supervision.  
The County denied Beyder’s request for protective
supervision in Notices of Action effective August 1 and September 27, 2022,
respectively. 
On June 21, 2022, Beyder requested an administrative hearing
from the denials of protective supervision. 

On November 21, 2022, an Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) issued
a decision finding that Beyder had a mental impairment, was non-self-directing,
and engaged in potentially dangerous activities.  The ALJ upheld the denials, finding that Beyder
did not require 24 hour-a-day supervision because her daughter, Inna Beyder,
had recently moved in with her and Beyder had not engaged in any subsequent potentially
dangerous activities.  Having determined
that Beyder did not require 24 hour-a-day supervision, the ALJ concluded that Beyder
was not eligible for IHSS protective supervision.  
On July 20, 2023, Beyder sent DSS a letter asking it to overturn
the ALJ’s decision.  The agency refused. 
Petitioner Beyder seeks a peremptory writ of administrative
mandate directing DSS to (1) reverse its decision denying her IHSS protective
supervision and provide retroactive benefits from August 1, 2021 to the present
or, in the alternative, (2) apply the correct law.  Beyder alleges that the ALJ abused her
discretion in two ways.  First, the ALJ
required Beyder to prove that she was continuously eloping to qualify for
protective supervision even though actual injury is not required.  Second, the ALJ failed to consider the risks
if Beyder was left alone and erroneously only considered what Beyder would do
when her familial caretakers were with her. 
 
2. Course of Proceedings
On January 11, 2024, Respondent filed an Answer. 
 
B. Standard of Review
CCP section 1094.5 is the administrative mandamus provision
which structures the procedure for judicial review of adjudicatory decisions
rendered by administrative agencies.  Topanga
Ass’n for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles, (“Topanga”)
(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 514-15.  
CCP section 1094.5 does not on its face specify which cases
are subject to independent review, leaving that issue to the courts.  Fukuda v. City of Angels, (“Fukuda”)
(1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 811.  In cases
reviewing decisions which affect a fundamental vested right the trial court
exercises independent judgment on the evidence. 
Bixby v. Pierno, (“Bixby”) (1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 143.  See CCP §1094.5(c).  The court reviews an agency’s determination
of an application for welfare benefits under the independent judgment
standard.  Fink v. Prod, (1982) 31
Cal.3d 166 178-79.
Under the
independent judgment test, “the trial court not only examines the
administrative record for errors of law but also exercises its independent
judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a limited trial de novo.”  Bixby, supra, 4 Cal.3d at 143.  The court must draw its own reasonable
inferences from the evidence and make its own credibility determinations.  Morrison v. Housing Authority of the City
of Los Angeles Board of Commissioners, (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 860,
868.  In short, the court substitutes its
judgment for the agency’s regarding the basic facts of what happened, when,
why, and the credibility of witnesses.  Guymon
v. Board of Accountancy, (1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 1010, 1013-16.
“In exercising its
independent judgment, a trial court must afford a strong presumption of
correctness concerning the administrative findings, and the party challenging
the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing the court that the
administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the evidence.”  Fukuda, supra, 20 Cal.4th at 817. 
Unless it can be demonstrated by petitioner that the agency’s actions
are not grounded upon any reasonable basis in law or any substantial basis in
fact, the courts should not interfere with the agency’s discretion or
substitute their wisdom for that of the agency. 
Bixby, supra, 4 Cal.3d 130, 150-51; Bank of America v.
State Water Resources Control Board, (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 198, 208.
The agency’s
decision must be based on a preponderance of the evidence presented at the
hearing.  Board of Medical Quality
Assurance v. Superior Court, (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 860, 862.  The hearing officer is only required to issue
findings that give enough explanation so that parties may determine whether,
and upon what basis, to review the decision. 
Topanga, supra, 11 Cal.3d 506, 514-15.  Implicit in CCP section 1094.5 is a
requirement that the agency set forth findings to bridge the analytic gap
between the raw evidence and ultimate decision or order.  Id. at 515.
An agency is presumed
to have regularly performed its official duties (Evid. Code §664), and the
petitioner therefore has the burden of proof. 
Steele v. Los Angeles County Civil Service Commission, (1958) 166
Cal.App.2d 129, 137.  “[T]he burden of
proof falls upon the party attacking the administrative decision to demonstrate
wherein the proceedings were unfair, in excess of jurisdiction or showed
prejudicial abuse of discretion.  Alford
v. Pierno, (1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 682, 691.
 
C. Governing Law
1. IHSS 
In 1973 the
Legislature enacted the IHSS program to enable aged, blind or disabled poor to
avoid institutionalization by remaining in their homes with proper supportive
services.  Marshall v. McMahon,
(“Marshall”) (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1841, 1844.  The purpose of the IHSS program is to provide
supportive services to persons who are unable to perform the services
themselves and cannot safely remain in their homes or abodes of their own
choosing unless these services are provided. 
Welfare and Institutions (“Welf.
& Inst.”) Code §12300(a).  The program compensates persons who provide
the services to a qualifying incapacitated person.  Basden v. Wagner, (“Basden”) (2010)
181 Cal.App.4th 929, 931.
IHSS is governed by
Welf. & Inst. Code sections 12300 et seq.  DSS is charged with administering the
IHSS program in compliance with state and federal laws.  Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 12301, 12302; Miller v. Woods, (1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 862, 868.  DSS is required to adopt regulations
establishing a range of services available to recipients based on their
individual needs.  Welf. & Inst. Code
§12301.1.  These regulations are set
forth in DSS’s MPP sections 30-700, et
seq.
The IHSS program
provides a range of supportive services to persons who are eligible for the
services.  MPP §30-755.1.  IHSS services include: (1) preparation
and cleanup of meals, routine laundry, shopping for food and errands; (2)
personal care services such as bowel and bladder care, dressing, bathing, oral
hygiene, grooming; (3) accompaniment to medical appointments; and (4)
protective supervision.  See Welf.
& Inst. Code §12300(b); MPP
§§ 30–757.11-.30–757.19.
Counties administer
the IHSS program under DSS’ supervision. 
Miller v. Woods, supra, 148 Cal.App.3d at 868.  Applicants must satisfy two eligibility
conditions to obtain any IHSS service: (1) they are “unable to perform the
services themselves” and (2) they “cannot safely remain in their homes or
abodes of their own choosing unless these services are provided.”  Welf. & Inst. Code §12300(a).  An applicant may receive up to 195 or 283
hours of services per month, depending on the severity of their needs.  Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 12303.4(a), (b),
14132.952(b).  The applicant may choose his
or her provider (Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 12304(b), 12304.1), including
relatives who live with them.  Welf.
& Inst. Code §12350; Basden, supra, 181 Cal.App.4th at 931.
            
2. Assessment of the Need for IHSS
County welfare departments administer the IHSS programs
under DSS’s supervision.  Miller v.
Woods, supra, 148 CalApp.3d 862, 868.  The county processes the application for IHSS
and determines the individual’s eligibility and needs and authorizes
services.  The total amount of services
is limited by statute, depending on the severity of the impairment and a
recipient’s needs.  Welf. & Inst.
Code §12303.4; Marshall, supra, 17 Cal.App.4th at 1844.  
Counties have a
legal duty to “endeavor at all times to perform...[their] duties in such manner
as to secure for every person the amount of aid to which he is entitled” (Welf.
& Inst. Code §10500), and they must “correctly determine eligibility and
need” for services (MPP §30-760.24).
To determine whether
a person needs help with tasks covered by an IHSS service (Welf. & Inst.
Code §12301.2(a)-(b); MPP §30-757.1(a)), a county must “evaluate the effect of
the . . . [person’s] physical, cognitive and emotional impairment on functioning”
to perform those tasks (MPP §30-756.1-.3) by using state assessment guidelines.  Welf. & Inst. Code §12309(a); MPP
§30-761.1.
Trained county
social workers determine which supportive services a recipient needs, and the
number of hours a recipient will receive for each authorized service, by using
a uniform needs assessment tool.  Welf. &
Inst. Code §§ 12305.7(e)(1), 12309; MPP §30-761.1.  A five-point scale is used to evaluate
eligibility including an examination of an applicant’s level of ability,
functioning, and dependence on assistance. 
MPP §§ 30-756.1, 30-756.2.  A
county must rank the degree of impairment in the person’s functioning from
“rank 1” – referring to a person needs no help performing the tasks – to “rank
5” – referring to a person needs total help performing them.  Welf. & Inst. Code §12309(d)(1), (2),
(5); MPP §30-756.1.  For each rank, state
regulations specify the average range of time it takes to help a person with
the tasks included in each IHSS service except protective supervision.  MPP §30-757.1(a).  
A county must
reassess a recipient’s need for IHSS services on an annual basis.  MPP §30-761.212.
 
3. Protective Supervision Benefits 
            Protective supervision is
a benefit offered through the IHSS program. 
Welf. & Inst. Code §12300(b). 
“Protective supervision” consists of observing recipient behavior and
intervening as appropriate in order to safeguard the recipient against injury,
hazard, or accident.”  MPP §30-757.17.  
            “Protective Supervision
is available for observing the behavior of nonself-directing, confused,
mentally impaired, or mentally ill persons only.”  MPP §30-757.171.  The required conditions for protective
supervision to be authorized are: (1) the person is “nonself-directing,
confused, mentally impaired, or mentally ill” (MPP §30-757.171); and (2) “a
need exists for twenty-four-hours-a-day of supervision in order for the
recipient to remain at home safely” (MPP §30-757.173(a)).  Such persons “cannot protect themselves from
injury.”  Miller v. Woods, supra,
148 Cal.App.3d at 869.
Protective
supervision benefits are not routinely offered but are offered if there is a
constant 24 hour-a-day need.  MPP
§30-757.173(a).  This does not include
predictable risks.  If the behavior in
question is considered predictable, and the need for supervision is at certain
times of the day, there is no protective supervision eligibility because there
is not a 24 hour-a-day need:
 
“Protective Supervision requires a 24/7 need, so if the behavior in
question is considered predictable, and the need for supervision is at certain
times of the day, there is no Protective Supervision eligibility because there
is not a 24 hour-a-day need. 
Alternatively, unpredictable episodic behavior does meet the 24/7
requirement, as the need for supervision is constant.  The unpredictable episodic behavior must be
frequent and long enough that constant supervision is necessary.”   ACL
No. 15-25, p. 5.[1]
 
In considering the
conditions for protective supervision, the applicant’s mental functions of
memory, orientation, and judgment are evaluated on a three-point scale: Rank 1
(unimpaired), 2 (mildly impaired), and 5 (severely impaired).  MPP §30-756.372.  Other factors could include the living
environment, age, lack of injuries and parental absence, and/or fluctuation in
needs.  Welf. & Inst. Code §12301.1.  The need for around-the-clock supervision hinges on whether the
applicant would engage in potentially dangerous behaviors if he/she did not
have 24-hour supervision.  MPP §§ 30-
756.372, 30-757.171; Calderon v. Anderson, (“Calderon”) (1996) 45
Cal.App.4th 607, 615, 616; Marshall, supra, 17 Cal.App.4th at
1852-53.  
As the need for 24-hour
supervision is a condition to qualify for protective supervision, the law
requires social services staff to request “that a person requesting protective
supervision submit [medical] certification to the county.”  Welf. & Inst. Code §12301.21.  This certification is on a DSS standard form
(SOC 821) that a physician or other qualified medical professional completes.  MPP §30-757.173(a)(1).  Another standard form (SOC 873) is a medical
certification form filled out by a licensed health care professional to enable
disabled, blind, or elderly individuals to receive services from the IHSS
program.  
The SOC 821 and SOC
873 forms are not dispositive of whether an IHSS recipient qualifies for
protective supervision.  Welf. &
Inst. Code §12301.21; MPP §30-757.173(a)(1)(A)(3).   Other
pertinent information such as the social worker’s interview with the recipient
is part of the overall assessment.  MPP
§30-757.173(a)(2).  As with all IHSS
services (except paramedical services), county social services staff make the
final determination whether a beneficiary meets the criteria for protective
supervision.  MPP §30-757.173.
 
            4. State Administrative Hearing
California has adopted a system for a fair hearing, codified
at Welf. & Inst. Code section 10950 et
seq. and Government Code section 11500 et
seq., which is consistent with federal requirements.  See 42
U.S.C. §671(a)(12).  If an applicant’s
request for benefits is denied, the applicant may request a hearing with DSS
conducted by an administrative law judge or DSS’s director.  Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 10950, 10055,
10953.  DSS is represented at the hearing
by an appeal hearing specialist.  MPP
§22-073.13.  The county is represented at
the hearing by a representative and its social worker also may attend.  
When DSS’s appeal hearing specialist is assigned to a case,
he or she must review the applicable law and the evidence in the case record,
including contacting the eligibility worker if necessary.  MPP §22-073.22.  If the appeal hearing specialist determines
that a hearing is appropriate, he or she must then contact the claimant to
inquire if the claimant plans to attend the hearing and determine if there are
any additional issues that the claimant intends to raise at the hearing.  MPP §22-073.232(a)-(b).  The appeal hearing specialist must provide
the claimant with “any and all information which can be of assistance to the
claimant in preparing for the hearing.” 
MPP §22-073.232(c).  This includes
all regulations and evidence, including evidence favorable to the claimant's
case.  Id.  The claimant must also be informed of the
availability of free legal representation. 
Id.  
The hearing is conducted by an administrative law judge,
required to prepare a written “fair, impartial and independent proposed
decision,” upon the close of the proceedings, addressing all issues identified
by the parties.  Welf. & Inst. Code
§§ 10953, 10953.5, 10954, 10958 and 10958.1. Hearings are conducted in an
“impartial and informal manner,” testimony must be submitted under oath or
affirmation, and the hearing need not be conducted in accordance with the rules
of procedure or evidence applicable in judicial proceedings.  Welf. & Inst. Code §10955.  
Judicial review of the decision is available under CCP
section 1094.5. Welf. & Inst. Code §10962.
 
D. Statement of Facts
1. Beyder’s Health Condition 
Beyder is an elderly woman whose diagnoses and medical
conditions include Alzheimer’s dementia, memory impairment, a stroke, a
craniotomy to remove a tumor, seizures, limited mobility of the upper and lower
extremities, and other physical limitations. 
See AR 4-5.[2]  Because of her mental disabilities, Beyder
tends to forget important information such as where she lives and who her
family is.  AR 8-12.  
As Beyder’s symptoms worsened over time, she began to engage
in dangerous behaviors.  Id.  She would (1) leave the stove running and walk
out of the room, (2) leave the water running in her bathtub, and (3) elope from
her home without supervision.  AR
12-13.  Beyder eloped from her home on
three separate occasions in November 2021, December 2021, and January 2022.  AR 12.  After one such incident, she explained that
she left because she was looking for her home and did not know where she was.  Id.  On one occasion, Beyder eloped even though her
daughter was at home.  AR 152. 
 
2. The County’s Assessment and Denial of Protective
Supervision
Beyder applied for IHSS protective supervision, a service
for people who, due to a mental impairment or mental illness, need to be
observed 24 hours-a-day to protect them from injuries, hazards, or accidents.  AR 4.  
In an NOA dated July 19, 2021, and effective August 1, 2021,
the County approved Beyder for 193 hours, 23 minutes of IHSS services per month
but denied Beyder’s request for protective supervision.  AR 98.  
The County subsequently issued NOAs that either made no
change or slightly increased IHSS services and denied Beyder’s requests for
protective supervision in NOAs, dated June 13, 2022 (effective January 1, 2022)
and July 22, 2022 (initially effective August 1, 2022 but later deemed
effective September 27, 2021).  AR51, 80,
205.  Prior to each denial of protective
services, County Social Worker Shogik
Begeyan (“SW Begeyan”) conducted an IHSS needs assessment of Beyder.  See AR 5. 
On June 21, 2022,
Beyder’s daughter and authorized representative, Inna Beyder (“Daughter”),
filed a request for a fair hearing on the denial of protective supervision.  AR 22. 

 
3. The Administrative Hearing
On August 17 and
October 28, 2022, Administrative Law Judge Holly McMahon (the “ALJ”) held a telephonic
hearing on the County’s denial of protective services in the three NOAs.  AR 99.  
Daughter appeared on
behalf of Beyder.  AR 100.  
Anait Mirzoyan appeared
as appeal hearing specialist for
DSS and SW Begeyan also testified.  AR
98.
 
a. Petitioner’s
Evidence
Daughter submitted
(1) a Power of Attorney dated May 12, 2021 (AR 28); (2) an SOC 821 Assessment
of Protective Supervision form dated August 20, 2021 (AR 34), and (3) a letter
from Beyder’s internist dated August 19, 2022 (AR 32).  AR 6.
 
(i). SOC 821
Beyder’s SOC 821, dated
August 20, 2021, was completed and signed by her neurologist.  AR 33, 35.  On the SOC 821, the neurologist noted that
Beyder suffered from mixed dementia and retained the mobility or physical
capacity to place herself in a situation which would result in injury, hazard,
or accident.  AR 34-35.  The physician determined that Beyder had a
moderate or intermittent deficit of memory, moderate or intermittent deficit of
orientation, and severely impaired judgment.  AR 34-35.  The neurologist recommended 24 hour-a-day
supervision for Beyder.  AR 35.
 
(ii). Internist Letter
Dated August 19, 2022
Beyder also
submitted a letter dated August 19, 2022, from her primary care provider which
stated:
 
“The patient was evaluated by neurology most recently on 3/17/2022. Per
review of the note, the neurologist suspects mixed dementia likely related to
an underlying neurocognitive condition such as Alzheimer's dementia as well as
vascular dementia. On review of the note, the neurologist also discussed the
recommendation of having 24/7 supervision. For a multitude of reasons including
flight risk, unsteady gait, poor executive function, risk for falls, and
decreased visual field, I agree with neurology recommendation of 24/7
supervision.”  AR 32.
 
(iii). Daughter’s Testimony
Daughter testified in
pertinent part as follows.  Beyder had
brain surgery for removal of a tumor in approximately June 2020.  AR 130. 
She had a seizure in the home on June 27, 2021.   AR 154. 
She has dementia and Alzheimer’s. 
AR 165.
In the pertinent
period of August 1, 2022, Beyder’s memory was not good because she had a hemorrhagic
stroke.  AR 123-24.   She
was very unstable after the stroke.  AR
140.  She knew her name but did not
recognize the inside of her own home.  AR
125.  She would ask Daughter to take her
home and Daughter would respond: “No, mom. 
You live here.”  AR 125.  Beyder would respond: “This is not where I
live.”  AR 126.  Beyder had lived in the apartment since
1981.  AR 126.
Beyder would ask
where her daughter was and “I want my daughter” to Daughter’s face.   AR 127. 
Other times -- maybe 10% of the time -- she knew who Daughter was.  AR 126. 
She remembers her son and grandchildren also sometimes.  AR 128-29. 
Daughter has two dogs, and Beyder knows the dogs.  AR 147.
Beyder is talkative
but does not make sense.  AR 136.  She often does not know the time of day.  AR 142-43.  Beyder tends to turn on her stove and leave
the room and Daughter Beyder has to stop her mother from turning on the stove
or oven every day.  AR 161.  The problem became so severe that Daughter
Beyder resorted to removing the knobs from the stove whenever she leaves the
house so as to prevent further incident. 
AR 162.  She goes on outings with
Daughter such as grocery shopping, but she does not want to get out of the car
and Daughter cannot leave her alone in it. 
AR 145.  So, Daughter makes her go
in the store.  AR 145.
Beyder has eloped
from the home three times.  AR 149.  On January 12, 2022, Beyder left the home when
Daughter was in the bathroom and Daughter could not find her.  AR 140, 152. 
She and her son found Beyder on a main street at an am/pm market, and
she was about to fall because she was about to have a seizure.  AR 141. 
She had to be hospitalized.  AR
151.  The other two times of eloping were
November and December 2021 when she said she was looking for her home.  AR 150-51. 
All three times she went to the street, half a block or a block and a
half away.   AR 150, 152-53.  Daughter has not put locks on the doors to
prevent Beyder from leaving.  AR 152.
Beyder leaves the
water running in the sink or the tub.  
AR 155.  She does this every other
day.  AR 156.  She does not overflow the tub because the
drain is open.   AR 157.  
She turns on the stove
every day, but Daughter stops her right away. 
AR 161-62.  Daughter takes off the
knobs if she has to leave.  AR 162.  Daughter makes Beyder the food she
likes.   AR 164.  
 
b. The County’s
Evidence
The County submitted
as evidence its Statement of Position with seven attachments.  AR 6.  Those
attachments were: (a) the June 13, 2022 NOA; (b) a case assessment narrative
dated July 16, 2021; (c) a Needs Assessment Form dated July 16, 2021; (d) the
SOC 821 dated August 20, 2021, (e) a May 19, 2021 NOA, (f) the July 19, 2021 NOA;
and (g) the Case Assessment Narrative dated July 14, 2022.  Id.
SW Begeyan testified
for the County.  AR 98.[3]
 
c. The ALJ’s
Decision
On November 21,
2022, the ALJ issued a decision denying Beyder’s eligibility for protective
supervision.  AR 2-21. 
Three NOAs were
relevant at the hearing: (1) the NOA dated July 19, 2021, and effective August
1, 2021; (2) the NOA dated June 13, 2022; and (3) the NOA dated July 22, 2022
and effective August 1, 2022.  AR 5, 20.   Although the appeal from the July 19, 2021
NOA was untimely, the ALJ found the NOA to be deficient because “it failed to
inform the claimant of the action the County intended to take in regards to
protective supervision and the specific regulations that support the
determination that protective supervision was not awarded.”  Because the protective supervision regulation
was absent, it was not adequate, and the ALJ had jurisdiction over Beyder’s appeal
from it.  AR 20.  The ALJ also determined that the NOA dated
June 13, 2022, was effective September 27, 2021, not its initial effective date
of January 1, 2022.  AR 5-6, 205. 
The ALJ found that Beyder
had a moderate deficit in memory.  She
recognizes family members whom she sees intermittently and knew that she has
grandchildren.  AR 9.  While there was a dispute between Daughter
and SW Begeyan about what Beyder said in the assessments, her memory is intact
at times and she has some memory in aspects of her life.  AR 9. 
Her memory is intermittent, a conclusion supported by the SOC 821.  AR 9.
Beyder has moderate
orientation.  AR 10.  She is oriented to herself and children (not
necessarily their names) and other familiar things like the pet dogs.  AR 10. 
She is oriented to her daily blood pressure reading and going on an
outing.  AR 10.  She therefore is oriented to some things, but
a conclusion of moderate disorientation is appropriate and supported by the SOC
821.  AR 10.
Beyder’s judgement
is severely impaired.  Daughter testified
that she has left the home three times, twice when she was outside looking for
her home.  AR 10.  On the third occasion she was having a
seizure.  AR 10.  Daughter stated that she has not had to
prevent Beyder from leaving the home.  AR
11.  Daughter also testified that Beyder
leaves the water running in the sink or tub every day, but the drains are
open.  AR 11.  Bedyer would go to the oven and turn it on
when she wants to cook something.  AR
11.  Daughter will run after her to stop
her and she has to do this every day.  AR
11.  Beyder may be hungry when she does
this because Daughter will then make her food . 
AR 11.  Beyder has broken a lot of
glasses.  AR 11.  Daughter takes the knobs off the stove when
she is gone.  Beyder’s judgment is
severely impaired, which is supported by the SOC 821.  AR 11. 
The ALJ noted that protective services are not available to anticipate a
medical emergency from seizure.  AR 11.
Beyder is
non-self-directing.  She has engaged in
elopement without knowledge that the beavior is risky or dangerous.  She does so, seeking to go home when she is
already home.  She attempts to turn on
the stove because she is hungry and wants food. 
AR 11-12.
Beyder engages in
potentially dangerous activities, including elopement from home in November and
December 2021 and January 12, 2022.  AR 12.
 This eloping occurred three times in a
three-month period.  AR 12.  However, Beyder has not engaged in this
behavior for ten months.  Daughter
testified that she moved in with Beyder on April 1, 2022 and she has not had to
prevent Beyder from leaving.  AR 12.  Daughter stated that Beyder left home before
she moved in.  AR 12.  The elopement behavior is unpredictable and
episodic, but it is not sufficiently frequent to make constant supervision
necessary.  AR 12.  Beyder has left home only three times in the
past ten months, and Daughter does not have to prevent her from leaving
home.  AR 12.
Beyder also turns on
the stove when she is hungry.  Daughter
has to stop her from doing so.  AR
12.  Because Beyder wants food when she
turns the stove on, this is a self-directed behavior, but Beyder does not
remember that she cannot cook due to her mental impairment.  AR 12. 
She receives seven hours per week for meal preparation and Daughter
testified that she cooks for Beyder when she tries to turn the stove on.  AR 12. 
Daughter removes the knobs when she leaves the home so that Beyder
cannot turn the stove on.  AR 12.  This environmental modification, coupled with
the meal preparation, has eliminated this safety hazard and protective services
cannot be authorized for it.  AR 12.
Finally, Beyder
turns on the water.  AR 12.  This is not a dangerous behavior because
Daughter testified that Beyder leaves the drains open.  AR 12.
Since Beyder engages
in dangerous activities, there must be a determination whether she requires
24-hour supervision.  AR 13.  In other words, the determination is whether
the recipient requires constant supervision due to the frequency, duration, and
intensity of her dangerous behavior.  AR
13.  The ALJ concluded that because “claimant’s
eloping is very sporadic…it is not frequent enough such that it requires 24-hours-a-day
supervision.  It is noted that per [Daughter’s]
testimony, the claimant has not tried to elope since [Daughter] began living
with her, and [Daughter] has not had to prevent the claimant from eloping.”  AR 13. 
Given these findings, the ALJ ruled that 24 hour-a-day supervision was not
needed.  AR 20.  
 
D. Analysis
Petitioner Beyder contends that the ALJ abused her
discretion by misapplying the standard for adult protective supervision.[4]
 
1. The Availability of Protective Supervision
Protective
supervision benefits are not routinely offered but are offered if there is a
constant 24 hour-a-day need.  MPP
§30-757.173(a).  This does not include
predictable risks.  If the behavior in
question is considered predictable, and the need for supervision is at certain
times of the day, there is no protective supervision eligibility because there
is not a 24 hour-a-day need.  ACL No.
15-25, p. 5.  Alternatively,
unpredictable episodic behavior does meet the 24/7 requirement, as the need for
supervision is constant.  The
unpredictable episodic behavior must be frequent and long enough that constant
supervision is necessary.”  Id.
In considering the
conditions for protective supervision, the applicant’s mental functions of
memory, orientation, and judgment are evaluated on a three-point scale: Rank 1
(unimpaired), 2 (mildly impaired), and 5 (severely impaired).  MPP §30-756.372.  Other factors could include the living
environment, age, lack of injuries and parental absence, and/or fluctuation in
needs.  Welf. & Inst. Code §12301.1.  The need for around-the-clock supervision hinges on whether the
applicant would engage in potentially dangerous behaviors if he/she did not
have 24-hour supervision.  MPP §§ 30-
756.372, 30-757.171; Calderon, supra 45 Cal.App.4th at 615, 616; Marshall,
supra, 17 Cal.App.4th at 1852-53.  
 
2. Whether the ALJ Misapplied the Law for Assessing an
Adult’s Need for Protective Supervision
a. Whether The ALJ Properly Assessed
Bedyer’s Memory, Orientation, and Judgment
The
recipient’s mental function shall be evaluated on a three-point scale (Ranks 1,
2, and 5) in the functions of memory, orientation and judgment.  This scale is used to determine the need for
protective supervision.”  MPP §
30-756.372; see also ACL 15-25, p. 6. 

The ALJ found that Beyder
had a moderate deficit in memory.  Her
memory is intermittent, and that conclusion is supported by the SOC 821.  AR 9.  Beyder
has moderate orientation.  AR 10.  She is oriented to some things, but a
conclusion of moderate disorientation is appropriate and supported by the SOC
821.  AR 10.  Finally, Beyder’s judgment is severely
impaired, which is supported by the SOC 821. 
AR 11.
It is
undisputed that the ALJ properly evaluated Beyder’s memory, orientation, and
judgment.  
 
b. Whether the ALJ Properly Assessed If Beyder Is Non-Self-Directing
MPP section
30-757.171 provides for protective supervision to “nonself directing, confused,
mentally impaired, or mentally ill persons”.  “Nonself-direction” is “an inability, due to a
mental impairment/mental illness, for individuals to assess danger and the risk
of harm, and therefore, the individuals would most likely engage in potentially
dangerous activities that may cause self-harm.”  ACL 15-25, p. 3.  
It is undisputed that the ALJ properly found Beyder to be
non-self-directing.  AR 11-12.
 
c. Whether
the  ALJ Properly Found That Beyder
Engates in Potentially Dangerous Activities
The ALJ found that Beyder
engaged in potentially dangerous activities of elopement and turning on the
stove when she is hungry.  AR 12.  Although Beyder also turns on the tub and
sink water, this is not a dangerous behavior because Daughter testified that
Beyder leaves the drains open.  AR 12.
It is undisputed the
ALJ properly found that Beyder’s elopement and turning on the stove are
potentially dangerous activities and that turning on the faucet is not.
 
d. Whether
the ALJ Properly Evaluated the Need for 24 Hour-a-Day Supervision Based on What
Bedyer Would Do If Left Alone
Assessing
the 24 hour-a-day need for protective supervision eligibility is no different
from assessing the need for any other IHSS service. The basic test is whether
the applicant can do it without someone’s help.  See Welf. & Inst. Code §12300(a)
(applicants are “unable to perform the services themselves and . . . cannot
safely remain in their homes . . . unless these services are provided”); MPP §§
30-761.13, 30-763.112.  If the applicant
cannot perform the service by himself/herself, the service is needed.  Since most people needing protective
supervision live with an adult -- usually a relative -- who is already
providing 24-hour supervision, state assessment guidelines require a county to
determine what an adult applicant would do if “left alone” without any
supervision.  An assumption that some
family member will provide the applicant with uncompensated supervision is an illegal
“housemate” regulation that denies IHSS protective supervision to
recipients when they live with an adult. 
See Miller, supra, 148 Cal.App.3d at 878.  
 
(i). Eloping
Beyder
argues that the ALJ did not apply this standard and instead imposed a more
burdensome standard because of Daughter’s presence in the household.  The
standard is whether a need exists at the moment of assessment for 24 hour-a-day
supervision to keep the claimant safe. Notably absent from this standard
is consideration of whether an independent or intervening presence negates the
need or importance of protective supervision for a claimant to remain in their
home.  Pet. Op. Br. at 10-11.
Instead
of determining whether a need existed for Beyder to have 24 hour-a-day
supervision to keep her safe, the ALJ applied a standard whether 24 hour-a-day
supervision was necessary now that Daughter was living with Beyder.  The ALJ
stated the following:
 
“[Beyder’s] eloping is very sporadic,
it is found that it is not frequent enough such that it requires 24-hours-a-day
supervision.  It is noted that per [Daughter’s] testimony,
the claimant has not tried to elope since [Daughter] began living with her, and
AR has not had to prevent the claimant from eloping. AR 13 (emphasis
added).
 
The medical evidence and Daughter’s testimony provide more
than sufficient evidence for the ALJ to determine that a need existed for 24 hour-a-day
supervision. Both medical professionals agreed that Beyder had severely
impaired judgment, suffered from Alzheimer’s dementia, had the ability to
endanger herself, and expressly advised 24 hour-a-day supervision. Daughter’s
testimony echoed the same.  Nonetheless,
the ALJ determined that Beyder’s eloping was tempered by her daughter’s
presence, and therefore there was no need for protective supervision.  Pet. Op. Br. at 11-12; Reply at 6-7.
Indeed, an argument can be made that Beyder’s failure to
elope since Daughter began living with her is strong evidence that she needs 24
hour-a-day supervision to remain safely in her own home.  Without 24 hour-a-day supervision, Beyder has
a tendency to elope and endanger herself. With such supervision, Beyder is able
to safely reside in her own home. The ALJ should have asked and determined
whether Beyder could function safely alone. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 12; Reply at 7-8.
Beyder
misreads the ALJ’s decision.  Although
she is correct that protective services should be evaluated based on an adult’s
individual need living alone, the ALJ did not decide that Daughter performed
some act to prevent Beyder from eloping. 
To the contrary, the ALJ expressly noted that Daughter had done nothing to
prevent Beyder from leaving, including not putting locks on the doors.  AR 152.  The ALJ’s point was that Bedyer had eloped
three times in a three-month period (November and December 2021 and January 12,
2022) but had not engaged in this behavior for ten months.  The ALJ noted that Daughter testified that
she moved in on April 1, 2022 and she had not prevented Beyder from
leaving.  AR 12.  In other words, the ALJ was pointing out that
Daughter would know if Beyder eloped because she was living with her, and it
had not happened.  The ALJ was relying on
Daughter as a witness, not as a third party with a duty to prevent eloping.
The ALJ’s’
conclusion was that Beyder’s elopement behavior was unpredictable and episodic
but not sufficiently frequent to make constant supervision
necessary.  AR 12.  Beyder had left home only three times in the
past ten months, and not at all in the seven months since January 20,
2022.  AR 12.[5]  This was not an improper application of the
standard.
 
(ii).
Turning on the Stove
Beyder
argues that the ALJ applied similar flawed
reasoning to Beyder’s tendency to turn on the stove.  The ALJ stated that because Daughter cooks for
her mother, has stopped her mother from lighting the stove every day, and takes
the stove’s knobs with her whenever she leaves the house, Daughter “has
eliminated the safety hazard that would otherwise put the claimant at risk, and
protective supervision cannot be authorized for this behavior.” AR 12.  Just because Daughter stops Beyder from
endangering herself daily does not mean that she no longer has a need for
supervision or that she is suddenly safe in her home without protective services.  Pet. Op. Br. at 11.
The correct inquiry is whether a need exists for 24 hour-a-day
supervision for Beyder to remain in her home safely.  The
purpose of protective supervision is to provide an individual with the
opportunity to safely stay at home and avoid possible institutionalization.  See MPP § 30-757.173.  This
need can exist
even when the claimant is not currently engaging in dangerous behavior.  The standard
is to determine whether a need exists for 24 hour-a-day supervision, not
whether it is necessary under the current environmental factors for 24 hour-a-day
supervision.  Pet. Op. Br. at 11-12.
Beyder is incorrect.  The purpose of protective supervision is
limited to “a nonskilled provider” “supply[ing] the ‘common sense’ or missing
cognitive skill to prevent harm from everyday hazards.”  Calderon,
supra, 45 Cal.App.4th at 616. 
The possibility of environmental modifications to prevent a hazard is an
express factor that may be considered.  Welf. & Inst. Code §12301.1.  The claimant’s behavior must be
episodic and unpredictable, as well as frequent and long enough, to warrant 24 hours
of protective supervision.    Environmental
modifications are relevant to this analysis:
Environmental modifications such as removing knobs from stove or adding safety latches can be
used, and should be encouraged, to eliminate the need for Protective
Supervision.  If the modification
eliminates the hazard, then there is no longer a need for Protective
Supervision and Protective Supervision should not be authorized.  MPP 30-757.173(a), see also ACL 15-25, p. 5
(emphasis added).
Bedyer need not be evaluated as if she will
perform these environmental modifications for herself.  The modifications may be imposed by someone
else who already is present performing other compensated IHSS services and has
a duty to do so.  Thus, if Daughter is
present in the home with a duty to perform personal care services, she may be
relied upon to deal with environmental issues raised by those services.  In making this decision, the ALJ was required
to evaluate the overlap in such services to ascertain if there were gaps in
which Beyder was prone to dangerous behavior at times when Daughter was not
performing personal care.
The ALJ
found that Beyder turns on the stove
when she is hungry, and that Daughter had to stop her from doing so.  AR 12. 
Beyder receives seven hours per week for meal preparation and Daughter
testified that she cooks for Beyder when the latter tries to turn the stove
on.  AR 12.  Daughter removes the knobs when she leaves
the home so Beyder cannot turn the stove on. 
AR 12.  This environmental
modification, coupled with the meal preparation, has eliminated this safety
hazard and protective services cannot be authorized for it.  AR 12.
            In other words, the ALJ found that Daughter
receives IHSS pay to provide meals for Beyder. 
She cooks for Beyder when Beyder is hungry, and that is the only time when
Beyder turns the stove on.  The
potentially dangerous behavior is predictable because it only occurs when
Beyder is hungry.  AR 162-64.   Presumably, Beyder is hungry at her
mealtime.  If the behavior in question is considered predictable, and the need for
supervision is at certain times of the day, there is no protective supervision
eligibility because there is not a 24 hour-a-day need.  ACL No. 15-25, p. 5.  
Additionally, Daughter performed an environmental
modification of taking the knob off the stove when she leaves the home, and
could have performed an even easier modification of taking the knobs off and
only putting them on the stove when she (Daughter) is performing her cooking
duties.  This conclusion does not violate
the requirement that protective supervision be evaluated as if Beyder lived
alone because Daughter was being paid, and had a duty, to perform cooking
tasks.[6]  
 
(iii). Conclusion
As DSS
argues (Opp. at 12), the ALJ based her decision on the frequency,
predictability, and likelihood of Beyder’s potentially dangerous activities,
not Daughter’s prevention of them.  The
decision was based on Beyder’s needs irrespective of Daughter and did not
constitute an abuse of discretion.[7]
 
            3. The ALJ Did Not Require
Actual Engagement in a Potentially Dangerous Activity
            Beyder also argues that the ALJ misapplied the law when she
required Beyder to actually engage in dangerous activity to warrant a need for
24-hours-a-day supervision.
For protective supervision, actual
injury is not necessary.  Norasingh v. Lightbourne, (“Norasingh”) (2014) 229
Cal.App.4th 740, 759.  “What is required
is evidence of a propensity for engaging in self-endangering behavior as a
result of her mental impairment” rather than a “contention that [claimant] is
required to actually engage in dangerous activity in order to remain eligible
for protective supervision.” Id.; see also
ACL 15-25, p. 5 (“A person with a documented history of non-self-direction, who
has a tendency to open the front door and start walking away, does not
necessarily have to make it into the street in order for this to be considered
potentially hazardous behavior.”) Wandering away from home has been expressly
recognized as the type of potentially dangerous conduct for which protective supervision is appropriate.  See Calderon, supra, 45 Cal.App.4th at 616.  Pet. Op. Br. at 14.
Beyder argues that the evidence was
that Beyder would turn on the stove or elope from her house multiple times. In
light of this evidence, the ALJ correctly found that Mrs. Beyder had a
propensity for engaging in self-endangering behavior as a result of her mental
impairment.  AR 13.[8]  Despite this finding, the ALJ denied protective supervision because Beyder
had not eloped while under Daughter’s supervision.  In contradiction to Norasingh, the ALJ required Beyder to continue to engage in actual dangerous
activity to be eligible for protective supervision.  The ALJ wrongly reasoned Beyder was not
eligible for protective supervision because Daughter’s presence effectively
ceased the eloping episodes.  Daughter’s
presence, however, did not cure or otherwise remove Beyder’s propensity for
dangerous activity; it merely mitigated its occurrence. By requiring Beyder to
continue to engage in actual dangerous activity, the ALJ committed dual legal
errors: one error of requiring the aid of third parties as in Maryann L. and a second error of contravening the rule against actual injury in Norasingh.  Had the ALJ applied the correct legal
standard, she would have found that Beyder had engaged in multiple acts of
dangerous behavior and therefore had a propensity to engage in them.  The inquiry would have ended there.  Instead, the ALJ imposed a heightened standard
that effectively ensured that Beyder would not access the services needed for
her to remain safely in her own home. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 15.
This argument
is erroneous.  There must be a constant 24 hour-a-day need to be eligible
for protective services.  MPP
§30-757.173(a).  The need for around-the-clock
supervision hinges on whether the applicant would engage in potentially
dangerous behaviors if he/she did not have 24-hour supervision.  MPP §§ 30- 756.372, 30-757.171; Calderon,
supra 45 Cal.App.4th at 615, 616; Marshall, supra, 17
Cal.App.4th at 1852-53.  If a potentially dangerous activity is considered
predictable, and the need for supervision is at certain times of the day, there
is no protective supervision eligibility because there is not a 24 hour-a-day
need.  ACL No. 15-25, p. 5.  Alternatively, “unpredictable episodic
behavior does meet the 24/7 requirement, but the behavior must be frequent
and long enough that constant supervision is necessary.”  Id. (emphasis added).
Under this standard,
the ALJ was required to evaluate not only whether Beyder engaged in potentially
dangerous activity, but also whether that activity was sufficiently frequent to
require 24 hour-a-day supervision.  Therefore,
the ALJ was entitled to consider the fact that no elopement had occurred for
seven months by the date of the hearing. 
This evaluation was not a requirement of actual injury (Norasingh)
but it was a requirement for propensity of dangerous behavior, and rightly so.  It also was not a requirement of third-party
protection (Maryann L.).
 
F. Conclusion
The Petition is
denied.  DSS’s counsel is ordered
to prepare a proposed judgment, serve it on Beyder’s counsel for approval as to
form, wait ten days after service for any objections, meet and confer if there
are objections, and then submit the proposed judgment along with a declaration
stating the existence/non-existence of any unresolved objections.  An OSC re: judgment is set for July 25, 2024
at 9:30 a.m.
