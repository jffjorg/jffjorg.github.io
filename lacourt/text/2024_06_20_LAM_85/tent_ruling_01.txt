  Case Number:  23STCP03564    Hearing Date:   June 20, 2024    Dept:  85 
Occhipinti v. County of Los
Angeles, et al.;
23STCP03564

Tentative decision on pitchess
motion:  granted




 



Petitioner Joe Occhipinti (“Occhipinti”) moves for an order
directing Respondents County of Los Angeles (“County”) and/or Los Angeles
County Sheriff’s Department (“Department”) to produce certain personnel
records. 
The court has read and considered the moving papers,
opposition, and reply, and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
1. Petition
Petitioner Occhipinti filed the verified Petition against
Respondents County and Department on September 28, 2023, alleging a (1)
traditional writ of mandate and (2) declaratory relief.  The Petition alleges in pertinent part as
follows. 
Occhipinti is employed by the County and Department as a deputy
sheriff.  Pet., ¶4.  On June 19, 2022, Occhipinti was involved in
an on-duty, solo traffic collision while working patrol at Lancaster Sheriff’s
station.  Pet., ¶5.  Occhipinti immediately called his supervisor,
Sergeant Andrew Stowers (“Stowers”) to report the traffic collision.  Pet., ¶5. 
Sergeant Stowers began an investigation into the cause of the collision
and called Deputy Vincent Clark (“Clark”) to the scene, who completed a
California Highway Patrol (“CHP”) 55 Traffic Crash report.  Pet., ¶6. 
On March 3,  2023,
Occhipinti was informed of various potential Department policy violations
stemming from the traffic collision via a Subject of Investigation Notification
sent from Captain Jason M. Schreiner (“Schreiner”) to Captain Ron Kupperud
(“Kupperud”).  Pet., ¶8.  The notification set the date that a sergeant
became aware of an act, omission, or other misconduct -- i.e.,
Department Knowledge Date -- as August 22, 2022.  Pet., ¶8. 
On May 4, 2023, Occhipinti was interviewed by Sergeant
Langdon from the Internal Affairs Bureau (“IAB”).  Pet., ¶9. 

On July 12, 2023, Occhipinti was called in for a second
interview.  During that interview, his
attorney objected on the record that the interview violated Government Code
section 3304(d)(1) because it took place more than one year after a person
authorized to initiate an investigation became aware of the potential
misconduct.  Pet., ¶9.
On August 15, 2023, Chief Dennis Kneer authored a
Disposition Sheet, determining that Occhipinti should be suspended for 30 days
for violating various Department policies. 
Pet., ¶11.  On August 20, 2023,
the Department issued Occhipinti a Letter of Intent to suspend him for 30 days
and informed him that he could grieve the discipline.  Pet., ¶12.
Occhipinti seeks (1) a traditional writ of mandate requiring
the County and Department to set aside the discipline as having been imposed in
violation of the Police Officers Bill of Rights Act (“POBRA”), and to pay him
all back salary together with interest at the legal rate and to restore
Occhipinti all other emoluments of employment related to such improper actions,
(2) a declaration that the knowledge of sergeants of the Department of
misconduct commences the one-year statutory period set forth in Government Code
section 3304(d)(1), (3) civil penalties against the County and Department in
the amount of $25,000 for each violation of Government Code section 3300 et
seq., (4) an injunction prohibiting the County and Department from pursuing
all disciplinary action against Occhipinti, (5) costs of suit, and (6)
attorney’s fees in accordance with the law, including Government Code section
800.  Pet., p. 8.
 
2. Course of Proceedings
On November 27, 2023, Petitioner Occhipinti served Respondents
County and Department with the Petition and Summons via personal service on
Deputy Clerk Bruce Crouchet (person in charge), effective October 13, 2023.
On February 2, 2024, Respondents filed an Answer. 
 
B. Applicable Law
A motion to discover a law enforcement officer’s personnel
file or other police agency record that contains relevant information is called
a¿Pitchess¿motion.  Pitchess v.
Superior Court,¿(1974) 11 Cal.3d 531, 536-40.  Pitchess motions permit a party, on a showing of good
cause, to seek information contained in the personnel files of officers that is
material to the proceedings, including evidence that may be used to impeach
witness officers.  Becerrada v.
Superior Court, (“Becerrada”) (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 409,
413.  Such information includes records
of an internal investigation conducted by a law enforcement agency.  Haggerty v. Superior Court, (2004)
117 Cal.App.4th 1079, 1085.
The¿Pitchess¿motion has been partly codified in
Evidence Code § 1043, which makes law enforcement personnel records privileged
and subject to disclosure only by noticed motion.¿  Evid. Code §1043; Penal Code § 832.7(a).  The statutory scheme governing¿Pitchess¿motions
is set forth in Evidence Code sections 1043-1047 and Penal Code sections 832.5,
832.7, 832.8.  People v.¿Mooc,¿(2001)
26 Cal.4th 1216, 1226.  These statutes
provide the exclusive means of discovery of such records in both criminal and
civil proceedings.  County of Los
Angeles v.¿Superior Court,¿(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1605, 1609-10.¿¿ 
Under the statutory scheme, a party seeking discovery of a
peace officer’s personnel records must file a written motion describing the
type of records sought, supported by affidavit showing good cause for the
discovery.¿ Haggerty v.¿Superior Court,¿supra, 117 Cal.App.4th at
1085-86.  The standard of “good cause” required for Pitchess disclosure is
“relatively relaxed.”  Association for
Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs v. Superior Court, (2017) 13 Cal.App.5th
413, 433.  Good cause for discovery
exists when the party shows both materiality to the subject matter of the
pending litigation and a reasonable belief that the agency has the type of
information sought.  Becerrada, supra, 131 Cal.App.4th at 413.  The materiality consideration involves
several inquiries: (1) whether the requesting party has shown a logical
connection between the charges and the proposed defense, (2) whether the request
for Pitchess discovery is factually specific and tailored to support its
claim of officer misconduct, (3) whether the requested Pitchess
discovery supports the proposed defense or is likely to lead to information
that would support the proposed defense, and (4) whether the requested
information would be admissible at trial. 
Warrick v. Superior Court, (“Warrick”) (2005) 35
Cal.4th 1011, 1027.  
The declarations in
support of good cause must present a “specific factual scenario of officer
misconduct that is plausible when read in light of the pertinent
documents.”  Warrick, supra, 35 Cal.4th at 1025; see also Riske v. Superior Court, (2016)
6 Cal.App.5th 647, 655 (requesting party must demonstrate a “plausible factual
foundation” for how the records are material to the subject matter of the
litigation).  A plausible scenario of
officer misconduct is one that might or could have occurred.  Id. at 1026.   The
documents must be requested “with adequate specificity” to preclude the
possibility that the moving party is engaged in a “fishing expedition.”  People v.¿Memro,¿(1985) 38 Cal.3d 658,
678, overruled on unrelated grounds,¿People v. Gaines,¿(2009)
46 Cal.4th 172, 181, n. 2.  Information
consisting of complaints concerning conduct occurring¿more than five years
before the event or transaction that is the subject of the litigation in aid of
which discovery is sought must be excluded from disclosure.   Evid.
Code §1045(b).¿¿The declarations
establishing good cause may be made on information and belief, personal
knowledge is not required.  See City
of Santa Cruz v. Municipal Court, (1989) 49 Cal.3d 74, 89.
If the trial court finds good cause for the discovery, it
reviews the pertinent documents in chambers and discloses only that information
falling within the statutorily defined standards of relevance.  Warrick, supra, 35 Cal.4th at 1027.  
 
C. Statement of Facts
On June 19, 2022,
Occhipinti was involved in a solo, on-duty traffic collision that caused minor
damage to his patrol vehicle.  Mell
Decl., ¶8a.  Occhipinti immediately
reported the collision to his supervisor, Sergeant Stowers, who thereafter
arrived on scene.  Mellk Decl., ¶8a.  The same day, Sergeant Stowers began an
investigation into the cause of the collision. 
Mellk Decl., ¶8b.  A CHP-55
Traffic Crash Report was filled out and Occhipinti provided a written statement
regarding how the collision occurred. 
Mellk decl., ¶8b.
On March 3, 2023,
Occhipinti was informed by the Department that he was the subject of an
administrative investigation because it had been determined that he was at
fault in the traffic collision.  Mellk
Decl., ¶8c.  The Subject of
Administrative Investigation Notification form noted that the Department
Knowledge date was August 22, 2022. 
Mellk Decl., ¶8c.
On May 4, 2023,
Occhipinti was interviewed by Sergeant Langdon from the Internal Affairs Bureau
(“IAB”).  Mellk Decl., ¶8d.
On July 12, 2023, Occhipinti
was called in for a second interview with IAB. 
Mellk Decl., ¶8e.  During the
second interview, Occhipinti’s attorney objected on the record that the
Department was in violation of Government Code section 3304(d)(1) -- i.e.,
the one-year statute of limitations for completing an investigation of alleged
misconduct following the agency’s discovery of such misconduct by an individual
authorized to commence an investigation. 
Mellk Decl., ¶8e.
On August 20, 2023,
Occhipinti was served with a Letter of Intent for a 30-day suspension.  Mellk Decl., ¶8f.
Occhipinti seeks
disclosure of his own personnel records. 
Mellk Decl., ¶4.  The Department
has sole custody and control of the records sought to be disclosed.  Mellk Decl., ¶5.  Occhipinti served Requests for Admissions,
Demand for Production of Documents, and Form Interrogatories on
Respondents.  Mellk Decl., ¶6.  Respondents objected to the Demand for
Production of Documents Nos. 6, 8, and 9 on the basis of peace officer
confidentiality and did not provide responses. 
Mellk Decl., ¶7.  Good cause
exists for production of the records responsive to these discovery
requests.  Mellk Decl., ¶8.
The documents sought
by Occhipinti are crucial for him to be able to demonstrate that the Department
violated the one-year statute of limitations in Government Code section
3304(d)(1).  Mellk Decl., ¶¶8-9.  Occhipinti has no alternate means to obtain
the requested discovery.  Mellk Decl.,
¶10.  Without the responses to the
discovery propounded on Respondents, Occhipinti has no means by which to
substantiate the allegations raised in his Petition.  Mellk Decl., ¶¶10-11.
 
D. Analysis
Petitioner
Occhipinti moves for an order that the County and/or Department produce certain
personnel records.  
Although the County
purports to oppose on the ground that Occhipinti’s supporting declaration fails
to establish good cause and materiality for the documents and that the
categories requested are overbroad (Opp. at 2), it fails to support this
argument with any reasoning.  Occhippinti
explains that the documents, all of which are in his personnel file and all of
which would be included any administrative record from a disciplinary hearing, are
necessary to establish when a person authorized to investigate Occhipinti’s
conduct became aware of it within the meaning of POBRA’s one-year limitations
period.   In other words, Occhipinti
seeks documents that will show what the Department knew and when it knew that
information.  
The motion is
granted.  The court will examine the requested
records in camera for a required production.  The County seeks a protective order in
connection with the disclosure to which Occhipinti objects, in part because it
purports to burden Occhipinti with a sealing obligation for his own
records.  The court will discuss with
counsel whether a protective order is needed beyond that statutorily required
by Evid. Code section 1045(e).
