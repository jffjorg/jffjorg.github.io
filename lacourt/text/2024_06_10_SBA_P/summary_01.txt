And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied the defendants' motion to transfer and consolidate the case with another case, Mandy Lambert v. Jaime Lynn Bauer, et al., Case No. 37-2023-00021750-CU-PA-CTL, which is pending in the Superior Court of San Diego County. The Judge found that the two cases involve different motor vehicle accidents, occurred on different dates, and in different counties, and therefore do not involve common questions of fact. Despite the plaintiff's allegations of similar injuries in both cases, the Judge did not find that the transfer and consolidation of the cases is appropriate.
