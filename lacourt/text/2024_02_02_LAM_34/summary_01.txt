And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a motion to compel initial responses to form interrogatories and request for sanctions. The plaintiff, Pranav Popat, moved the court to compel the defendant, Hardik B. Kapadia, to serve responses to form interrogatories and requests for production of documents. The defendant opposed the motion, but the court finds that the responses were served late and therefore the motion is moot.

The court grants the plaintiff's motion to compel compliance with responses to requests for production, set one and request for sanctions, and orders the plaintiff to provide initial responses to the requests for production within seven days of the issuance of the order.

The court awards monetary sanctions in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant and defense counsel, jointly and severally, in the total amount of $1,723.00. The court finds that the defendant failed to serve timely responses to the discovery requests and that there is no substantial justification for the failure to serve timely responses.
