And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that the Demurrer to the complaint is sustained without leave to amend. The Demurrer was filed by the Defendant, City of Los Angeles, and argues that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for quiet title and declaratory relief. The Judge found that the covenant that runs with the land, which was recorded in 2006, was not extinguished by foreclosure and is binding upon all subsequent purchasers of the property, including the Plaintiffs. The Judge also found that the declaratory relief cause of action is derivative of the quiet title cause of action and is therefore duplicative and subject to demurrer. As a result, the case is dismissed.
