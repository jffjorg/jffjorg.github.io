And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant CarMax, Inc.'s motion to quash service of summons. The plaintiff Gail Wiggan failed to show valid service of summons on the defendant. The defendant was served by mail, but this method of service is not valid under California law. The plaintiff's proof of service did not include the summons, and the court finds that the service was defective. Therefore, the court grants the defendant's motion to quash service of summons and orders that any future pleadings or papers be served on the defendant in a valid manner.
