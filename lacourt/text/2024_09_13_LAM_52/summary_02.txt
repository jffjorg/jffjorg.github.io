And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendants' motion for summary adjudication of issues, which sought to dispose of 10 issues related to the plaintiff's causes of action. The defendants argued that the plaintiff's alter ego and single enterprise doctrine had no merit, but the judge found that the motion did not dispose of the entire cause of action. The judge cites various cases, including Tucker Land Co. v. State of California and Aguirre v. Southern Pac. Co., to support the conclusion that summary adjudication is only proper when it completely disposes of a cause of action, and that the defendants' motion did not meet this standard.
