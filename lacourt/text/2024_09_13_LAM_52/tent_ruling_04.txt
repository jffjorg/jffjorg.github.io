 Case Number:  22STCV28415    Hearing Date:   September 13, 2024    Dept:  52 Specially Appearing Defendant CarMax, Inc.’s Motion to
Quash Service of Summons
            Specially appearing defendant CarMax,
Inc. moves to quash service of summons by plaintiff Gail Wiggan.  “[O]nce a defendant files a motion to quash
the burden is on the plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the
validity of the service and the court’s jurisdiction over the defendant.”  (Bolkiah v. Superior Court (1999)
74 Cal.App.4th 984, 991.)  “ ‘Compliance
with the statutory procedures for service of process is essential to establish
personal jurisdiction.’ ”  (Ellard v.
Conway (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 540, 544.) 
An order “ ‘entered against a defendant who was not served with a
summons in the manner prescribed by statute is void.’ ”  (Ibid.)
            Plaintiff does not show valid
service of summons on defendant CarMax, Inc. 
Acquiring personal jurisdiction generally requires “personal delivery”
of the summons and complaint.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 415.10.)  The Code of Civil
Procedure also permits various other methods of service of summons.  (See, e.g., Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20.)  Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing
service by mail on CarMax, Inc. of several documents, not including the
summons.  (Zamost Decl., ¶ 2, Exs.
1-2.)  This service was defective because
(a) it did not include the summons, and (b) service by mail is not a valid
means of service of process.
            Specially appearing defendant
CarMax, Inc.’s motion to quash service of summons is granted.  The court hereby quashes the service
of any pleadings or other papers on defendant CarMax, Inc.
