 Case Number:  23STCV14071    Hearing Date:   September 13, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendants Ai Y. Gong’s Demurrer to
Plaintiffs’ Complaint
Defendant
Ai Y. Gong (named in the complaint as Doe 11) demurs to the fifth cause of
action alleged in the complaint by plaintiffs Min-Hsiung Chien, Nancy M. Chien,
Stan Chien, and Allen Chien.  
After
Gong demurred, plaintiffs requested dismissal of the fifth cause of action as
against Gong.  This demurrer is therefore
moot.  Defendant Ai Y. Gong is ordered
to answer within 20 days.
