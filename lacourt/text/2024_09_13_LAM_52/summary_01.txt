And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting plaintiff Alexis Mitchell's motion to quash trial subpoenas served by defendant Quantum Environmental Testing, Inc. The subpoenas were overly broad and sought a wide range of records, including medical, employment, and educational records, without limiting the scope of the request. The judge found that the plaintiff showed good cause to quash the subpoenas, as she established a legally protected privacy interest, an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy, and a serious threatened intrusion. The judge balanced the need for disclosure against the right to privacy and concluded that the plaintiff's privacy rights outweighed Quantum's need for disclosure. The judge therefore granted the motion and quashed the subpoenas.
