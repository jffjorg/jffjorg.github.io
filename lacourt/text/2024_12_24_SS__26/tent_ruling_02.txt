 Case Number:  22STLC08552    Hearing Date:   December 24, 2024    Dept:  26 Diaz v. Urban Cantina Group, et al.,TENTATIVE RULING:Plaintiff Alejandro Diaz’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED IN THE AMOUNT OF $11,950.00. PLAINTIFF IS TO FILE AND SERVE A PROPOSED AMENDED JUDGMENT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.ANALYSIS:On December 22, 2022, Plaintiff Alejandro Diaz (“Plaintiff”) filed the Complaint in this action against Defendants Urban Cantina Group, Richard Brent, Steven Elliot Edelson aka Steven E. Edelson aka Steven Edelson aka Steve Edelson as Trustee of the Los Angeles Entertainment Trust, and Sonny Sargon Rouel aka Sonny S. Rouel aka Sonny Rouel (“Defendants”). The Complaint alleges a single violation of section 51 of the Unruh Civil Rights Act. (Compl., ¶7.)Defendants Edelson and Rouel filed an answer on March 2, 2023. Following Defendant Urban Cantina Group’s failure to file a responsive pleading, the Court entered its default on March 17, 2023. On July 10, 2023, Plaintiff filed motion to compel responses to form and specialinterrogatories, which they withdrew two days later. On March 31, 2024, the parties filed a stipulation to continue the trial date.The action came for trial on November 7, 2024, at which time the Court found in favor of Plaintiff in the amount of $4,000.00. (Minute Order, 11/07/24.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Award of Attorney’s Fees on November 26, 2024. Defendants Edelson and Rouel filed their opposition on December 12, 2024.DiscussionTiming of MotionPlaintiff brings the instant Motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 52 and Cal. Rules of Court rule 3.1702. A motion for attorney’s fees must be filed and served with the time for filing a notice of appeal under Cal. Rules of Court Rule 8.822. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1702(a).) Cal. Rules of Court Rule 8.822 states that an attorney’s fees motion must be filed within either (1) 30 days after the trial court clerk served the party filing the motion with notice of entry of judgment; or (2) 90 days after entry of judgment. (Cal. Rules of Court 8.822(1).) Judgment has yet to be entered in this case, therefore, the Motion is timely.Prevailing PartyPlaintiff contends it is entitled to attorney’s fees as the prevailing party in this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 52, subdivision (a), which states:Whoever denies, aids or incites a denial, or makes any discrimination or distinction contrary to Section 51, 51.5, or 51.6, is liable for each and every offense for the actual damages, and any amount that may be determined by a jury, or a court sitting without a jury, up to a maximum of three times the amount of actual damage but in no case less than four thousand dollars ($4,000), and any attorney's fees that may be determined by the court in addition thereto, suffered by any person denied the rights provided in Section 51, 51.5, or 51.6.(Civ. Code, § 52, subd. (a).) The Court found Defendants violated Plaintiff’s rights under Civil Code section 51 and entered judgment in favor of Plaintiff in the amount of $4,000.00. (Minute Order, 11/07/24, p. 2.) Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to an award of attorney’s fees as determined by the Court.Amount of Attorney’s FeesPlaintiff moves for an award of $13,200.00 in attorney’s fees based on 26.4 hours billed at $500.00 per hour. (Motion, Mehrban Decl., ¶¶3-4.) The moving party bears the burden of proof with respect to attorney’s fees. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(5)(A).) Specifically, a party seeking fees has the burden of showing the fees incurred are “allowable,” are “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation,” and are “reasonable in amount.” (Levy v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 807, 816.)The Court’s objective is to award attorney’s fees at the fair market value based on the particular action. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) “The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.” (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “‘[T]he fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate . . . .’” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1134.) The lodestar method is based on the factors, as relevant to the particular case: “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Id. at 1132.) “The ‘experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in his court, and while his judgment is of course subject to review, it will not be disturbed unless the appellate court is convinced that it is clearly wrong.’”(Id.) A negative modifier was appropriate when duplicative work had been performed. (Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819.)The Court finds that $500.00 per hour is a reasonable hourly rate for an attorney with more than 30 years of experience in civil rights cases. (Motion, Mehrban Decl., ¶4; see Nemecek & Cole v. Horn (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 641, 650-651 [referring to the Laffey Matrix].) Although Defendants argue that this hourly rate is excessive because it is not actually paid by Plaintiff, and excessive under a lodestar calculation, the opposition cites no legal authority for this argument. Also, it is unclear what Defendants mean by “actually paid” or what relevance this standard has to the reasonableness of the hourly rate sought. They also argue that some of the relevant factors under case law warrant a reduction in the hourly rate. Those factors include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill displayed in presenting them; (2) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys; (3) the contingent nature of the fee award, both from the point of view of eventual victory on the merits and the point of view of establishing eligibility for an award; . . . .” (Press v. Lucky Stores, Inc. (1983) 34 Cal.3d 311, 322 [citing Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49].)The Court agrees that Plaintiff’s counsel brings the same kinds of cases repeatedly such that they are not novel or difficult, however the cases do require knowledge and skill that supports the requested the hourly rate. Regarding Defendants’ argument that Plaintiff’s counsel was not precluded from other employment while working on this, the Court finds this speculative. Even if Plaintiffs’ counsel was not precluded from other employment by this case, that factor is more relevant to increasing the hourly rate because of the risk undertaken by the attorney, not grounds to reduce a facially reasonable rate. Therefore, Plaintiff is awarded fees at $500.00 per hour.Regarding the number of hours billed, Plaintiff’s attorney declares they spent 26.4 hours. Defendants contend that 7.2 of these hours are “not fairly chargeable to the Defendants” but does not explain what this “fairly chargeable” standard entails or from what authority it derives. As explained above, the relevant consideration is whether the time billed was “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation.” (Levy, supra, 4 Cal.App.4th at 816.) Although Defendants argue against the time Plaintiff’s counsel spent on the stipulation to continue trial because it was continued for Plaintiff’s counsel’s personal reasons, this does not mean the stipulation was not reasonably necessary to the litigation.The opposition also points to time spent by Plaintiff on discovery that was improperly drafted (1.1 hours) such that it had to be redrafted and a motion to compel that Plaintiff withdrew as premature (0.8 hours), which the Court agrees was not reasonably necessary to the litigation. (See Opp., Smith Decl., ¶¶5, 7.) Next, moving Defendants object to entries dated from January 2023 that were for serving and defaulting other parties, however, the entries only indicate time spent on correspondence to process servers. There is nothing to show to which Defendants these entries pertain. Third, moving Defendants protest that Plaintiff’s counsel double charged for trial preparation on October 2, 2024 and October 31, 2024, which the Court agrees calls for a reduction of 0.6 hours. Finally, they contend that 1.3 hours spent by Plaintiff’s counsel on preparation of the trial brief should be excluded, but do not explain why. The number of hours billed is reduced by 2.5 hours to 23.9 hours.Accordingly, Defendants are awarded attorney’s fees of $11,950.00.ConclusionPlaintiff Alejandro Diaz’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED IN THE AMOUNT OF $11,950.00. PLAINTIFF IS TO FILE AND SERVE A PROPOSED AMENDED JUDGMENT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.Moving party to give notice.
