(“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendants Wine Gallery, Laguna Beach aka The Wine Gallery aka Wine Gallery and Christopher John Olsen aka Christopher J. Olsen aka Chris J. Olsen aka Chris Olsen dba WineGallery, Laguna Beach adba The Wine Gallery adba Wine Gallery (“Defendants”). Following Defendants’ failure to file a responsive pleading, the Court entered their default on November 28, 2023 and default judgment on July 31, 2024.Defendants filed the instant Motion Requesting Relief from Dismissal, from Default, to Set Aside Default and Default Judgment on December 2, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date.DiscussionDefendants move to vacate the entry of default pursuant to the mandatory relief provision of Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). Under this statute an application for relief must be made no more than six months after default judgment and must be accompanied by an affidavit of attorney fault attesting to their mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) The motion must also be accompanied by a copy of the moving defendant’s proposed pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) This can be corrected if the defendant submits a proposed responsive pleading by the hearing date. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403.)The instant Motion was timely filed less than five months after entry of default and is supported by an attorney declaration of fault in which defense counsel states that they believed a stipulation to vacate the entry of default was filed back in February 2024. (Motion, Jacobs Decl., ¶¶6-13 and Exhs. A-G.) The stipulation was apparently rejected by the Court and defense counsel overlooked the rejection. (Id. at ¶¶15-16.) In fact, believing the stipulation had been filed, Defendants filed an answer to the Complaint that was accepted by the Court on June 20, 2024. Based on the timely filing of the instant Motion with the requisite declaration of fault and proposed responsive pleading, Defendants are entitled to an order vacating the entry of default and default judgment.ConclusionDefendants Christopher John Olsen and Wine Gallery, Laguna Beach’s Motion Requesting Relief from Dismissal, from Default, to Set Aside Default and Default Judgment is GRANTED. THE DEFAULT ENTERED ON NOVEMBER 28, 2023 AND DEFAULT JUDGMENT ENTERED ON JULY 31, 2024 ARE HEREBY VACATED.
