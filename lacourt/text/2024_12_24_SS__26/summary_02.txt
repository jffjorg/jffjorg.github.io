And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $11,950.00. The plaintiff, Alejandro Diaz, brought a complaint against the defendants, Urban Cantina Group, Richard Brent, Steven Elliot Edelson, and Sonny Sargon Rouel, alleging a violation of section 51 of the Unruh Civil Rights Act. The defendants failed to file a responsive pleading, and the court entered a default against Urban Cantina Group. The case went to trial, and the court found in favor of the plaintiff, awarding him $4,000.00 in damages.

The plaintiff then brought a motion for attorney's fees, seeking $13,200.00 based on 26.4 hours of work at $500.00 per hour. The defendants opposed the motion, arguing that the hourly rate was excessive and that some of the time billed was not reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation.

The judge found that the hourly rate of $500.00 per hour was reasonable, given the plaintiff's counsel's experience and the complexity of the case. The judge also reduced the number of hours billed by 2.5 hours to 23.9 hours, finding that some of the time spent was not reasonably necessary to the litigation.

The judge awarded the plaintiff attorney's fees in the amount of $11,950.00, which is the amount of fees that the plaintiff's counsel reasonably incurred in order to prevail in the case. The plaintiff is ordered to file and serve a proposed amended judgment within 20 days of the order.
