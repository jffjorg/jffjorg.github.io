  Case Number:  21STLC05896    Hearing Date:   December 24, 2024    Dept:  26 State Farm v. DeLeon, et al.,TENTATIVE RULING:Defendant Dennis Deleon aka Dennis Martinez’s Motion for Order Continuing Trial and Trial Related Dates is DENIED.ANALYSIS:Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendants Dennis Deleon aka Dennis Martinez (“Defendant Deleon”) and Hertz Vehicles, LLC (“Defendant Hertz”) on August 11, 2021. Defendant Hertz filed an answer on December 1, 2021.Trial in this matter was originally set for February 8, 2023. Defendant Hertz’s ex parte application to continue the trial date and reopen discovery was granted on January 20, 2023. (Minute Order, 01/20/23.) Trial was continued to August 8, 2023, with related discovery and motion dates to follow. (Ibid.) Stipulations were filed by Plaintiff and Defendant Hertz in June 2023, August 2023, and October 2023, continuing the trial date again, with the third continuance set for March 11, 2024.Defendant DeLeon filed an answer on October 23, 2023. On January 4, 2024, the Court granted Defendant Hertz’s motion for summary judgment. (Minute Order, 01/04/24.) All three parties then stipulated to continue the trial date to June 11, 2024. The Court inadvertently called the case for trial on March 11, 2024 and following Plaintiff’s non-appearance, dismissed the action. (Minute Order, 03/11/24.) Plaintiff then subsequently brought a motion to vacate the dismissal, which the Court granted on May 7, 2024. (Minute Order, 05/07/24.) A trial setting conference was set for June 11, 2024, at which time the trial was set for January 16, 2025. (Minute Order, 06/11/24.)Defendant DeLeon filed the instant Motion for Order Continuing Trial and Trial Related Dates on November 27, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date.DiscussionDefendant DeLeon moves for a trial continuance pursuant to Cal. Rules of Court rule 3.1332, which provides “[a]lthough continuances of trials are disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own merits. The Court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, subd. (c).) The Court may look to the following factors in determining whether a trial continuance is warranted: (1) proximity of the trial date; (2) whether there was any previous continuance of trial due to any party; (3) the length of the continuance requested; (4) the availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion; (5) the prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance; and (6) whether trial counsel is engaged in another trial. (See generally, Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, subd. (d)(1)-(11).) Additional factors for the Court to consider include: a party’s excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent efforts; whether all parties have stipulated to a continuance; and any other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or application. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, subds. (c), (d).)Defendant DeLeon argues that good cause exists for a continuance of the trial date, which is currently set for January 16, 2025, because they have been unable to take the depositions of Plaintiffs’ insureds. Despite serving notices of deposition on Plaintiff’s insureds, who are witnesses to the accident that is the subject of this action, the insured have refused to appear. (Motion, Nelson Decl., ¶3 and Exhs. A-D.) Defendant DeLeon contends that the trial date should be continued until these depositions take place. In considering the aforementioned factors, the Court finds that they do not weigh in favor of a continuance. There have been numerous continuances of the trial date, including two since Defendant DeLeon filed their answer. Nor is the Court satisfied with Defendant DeLeon’s inability to take the depositions of Plaintiffs’ insureds. The deposition notices were served in August 2023 and November 2023, more than a year prior to this hearing. The Motion does not indicate what efforts Defendant DeLeon has taken to re-notice or compel these depositions since the failures to appear over one year ago. No motions to compel depositions have been filed, or are pending. No new deposition notices appear to be pending. The supporting declaration of defense counsel offers no explanation as to why this situation involving Plaintiffs’ insureds has dragged on for nearly 16 months, given how critical their testimony purportedly is to Defendant DeLeon’s defense. The Motion, therefore, does not demonstrate Defendant DeLeon’s diligence with respect to their inability to obtain this essential evidence.ConclusionBased on the foregoing, Defendant Dennis DeLeon aka Dennis Martinez’s Motion for Order Continuing Trial and Trial Related Dates is DENIED.Court clerk to give notice.
