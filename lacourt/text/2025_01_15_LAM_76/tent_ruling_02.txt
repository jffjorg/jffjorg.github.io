ANALYSIS
Motion For Judgment
On The Pleadings
Meet and Confer
            The Declaration of Defendant Leticia
Roa Saguanpong reflects that she satisfied the meet and confer requirement set forth
in Civ. Proc. Code, § 439.
Discussion
On a motion for judgment on the pleadings,
the same rules applicable on demurrer apply. (County of Orange v. Association of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs (2011)
192 Cal.App.4th 21, 32-33.)
Defendant Leticia Roa Saguanpong moves
for judgment on the pleadings as to the Complaint as follows:
1.         First Cause
of Action (Slander Per Se).
            A.        Re: Litigation Privilege.
            Defendant argues
that the litigation privilege bars this cause of action, as it is based on communications
and statements possibly made by Defendant in the course and scope of an investigation
during ongoing litigation of the Trust case. Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s claims
are thus entirely predicated on Defendant’s internal communications amongst Plaintiff’s
relatives and their attorney regarding Defendant’s observations while acting as
Plaintiff’s caregiver. Defendant argues that stating observations or reports of
suspected criminal activities are absolutely privileged and may not serve as predicates
for tort claims, except malicious prosecution.
            Plaintiff argues
that at the time of the alleged statements, Fierstadt’s prior petition had been
dismissed under the five year rule pursuant to a motion made in May 2022, and there
was no other petition threatened in any form by Fierstadt against Lance Mann until
March 2023, when the present petition was filed by Fierstadt without prior discussion,
threat or notice. Plaintiff argues that Defendant defamed Plaintiff by making the
misrepresentations after the 2018 petition of the four siblings was dismissed in
early fall of 2022, and before the filed a new petition based on the misrepresentations
of Movant in fall of 2022 and early 2023, presumably to infuse the situation with
bad blood and get the litigation going again.
            Here, the Complaint
expressly alleges that the statements which Defendant Leticia Roa Saguanpong, referred
to in the Complaint as “Letty” made to Plaintiff’s niece Joy Mann, referred to in
the Complaint as “Joy,” were for the purpose of encouraging Joy to start new litigation
against Plaintiff, and which successfully caused Joy and her brothers to file a
new petition against Plaintiff. (Complaint, ¶¶ 7 – 36.) These alleged statements
made to encourage litigation are protected by the litigation privilege, even though
they are alleged to have been known to be false and even if made with malice:
The litigation privilege “precludes liability arising
from a publication or broadcast made in a judicial proceeding or other official
proceeding.” (Fremont Reorganizing Corp. v. Faigin (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1153, 1172 [131 Cal. Rptr. 3d 478].)
Under the usual formulation of the privilege, it applies “to any communication (1)
made in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by litigants or other participants
authorized by law; (3) to achieve the objects of the litigation; and (4) that have
some connection or logical relation to the action.” (Silberg
v. Anderson (1990) 50 Cal.3d 205, 212 [266
Cal. Rptr. 638, 786 P.2d 365] (Silberg).) Silberg emphasizes that, to be protected by the litigation privilege, a communication must be
“in furtherance of the objects of the litigation.” (Id. at p. 219.) This is “part of the requirement that the communication
be connected with, or have some logical relation to, the action, i.e., that it not
be extraneous to the action.” (Id. at pp. 219–220.)
“Many cases have explained that [Civil
Code] section 47(b) encompasses not only testimony in court and statements made
in pleadings, but also statements made prior to the filing of a lawsuit, whether
in preparation for [*608]  anticipated litigation
or to investigate the feasibility of filing a lawsuit.” (Hagberg v. California Federal Bank (2004) 32 Cal.4th 350, 361 [7 Cal. Rptr. 3d 803,
81 P.3d 244].) “A prelitigation communication is privileged only when it relates
to litigation that is contemplated in good faith and under serious consideration.”
(Citations omitted.)
      (Kettler
v. Gould (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 593, 607-608 [bold emphasis added].)
The litigation privilege applies “to any
communication (1) made in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by litigants
or other participants authorized by law; (3) to achieve the objects of the litigation;
and (4) that have some connection or logical relation to the action.” (Citation
omitted.) “This privilege is absolute in nature, applying ‘to all publications,
irrespective of their maliciousness.’ [Citation.]” (Citation omitted..)
“‘Any doubt about whether the privilege applies is resolved in favor of applying
it. [Citation.]’” (Citation omitted.)
(Contreras v. Dowling (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 394, 415 [bold emphasis and underlining
added].)
The litigation privilege is absolute;
it applies, if at all, regardless whether the communication was made with malice
or the intent to harm. (Citation omitted.) Put another way, application
of the privilege does not depend on the publisher’s “motives, morals, ethics or
intent.” (Citation omitted.) Although originally applied only to defamation
actions, the privilege has been extended to any communication, not just a publication,
having “some relation” to a judicial proceeding, and to all torts other than malicious
prosecution. ( Citations omitted.) . . .
 
If there is no dispute as to the operative
facts, the applicability of the litigation privilege is a question of law. (Citation
omitted.) Any doubt about whether the privilege applies is resolved in favor of
applying it. (Citation omitted.)
(Kashian v. Harriman (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 892, 913 [bold emphasis and underlining
added].)
            This cause of
action is based on the foregoing alleged statements. As such, the allegations against
Defendant which form the basis of this cause of action are barred by the litigation
privilege.
            The motion for
judgment on the pleadings is GRANTED without leave to amend as to the first
cause of action, unless Plaintiff can demonstrate a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment.
            B.        Re: Common Interest Privilege.
 
            Defendant argues
that communications between Plaintiff’s relatives and any person acting in an assistant/caregiver
capacity for Plaintiff regarding Plaintiff’s overall health and the  
inner workings of the Trust assets for which Plaintiff’s relatives
are beneficiaries fall squarely  within the
common interest privilege codified in Civil Code §47(c). Moreover, Defendant argues,
Plaintiff cannot show that any statements were made with malice to defeat the qualified
privilege. 
 
            Plaintiff argues
that this privilege is inapplicable because Defendant has stated that she has no
interest in the trust at issue, and was not a party to the now-dismissed probate
action, and thus she has no common interest. 
 
            Based on the
ruling on the litigation privilege, above at 1.A., the Court does not address this
argument.
 
            C.        Re: Failure to State Prima Facie Case.
 
            Defendant argues
that Plaintiff has not pled that he has been charged with a crime or with having
been indicted, convicted, or punished for a crime, that Defendant has imputed him
with the present existence of an infectious, contagious or loathsome disease, that
he has been injured with respect to his office, profession, trade or business, or
imputes to him importance or a want of chastity.
 
            Plaintiff argues
that the statements may injure him in his office as trustee of a trust, that he
managed with his mother and then took over after she died.
 
            Based on the
ruling on the litigation privilege, above at 1.A., the Court does not address this
argument.
 
2.         Second Cause
of Action (Libel Per Se).
 
            A.        Re: Litigation Privilege.
 
            Defendant argues
that the litigation privilege bars this cause of action. See argument above at 1.A.
 
            This cause of
action is based on the foregoing alleged statements. As such, the allegations against
Defendant which form the basis of this cause of action are barred by the litigation
privilege. 
 
            The motion for
judgment on the pleading is GRANTED without leave to amend as to the second
cause of action, unless Plaintiff can demonstrate a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. 
 
            B.        Re: Common Interest Privilege.
 
See argument above at 1.B.
 
            Based on the
ruling on the litigation privilege, above at 2.A., the Court does not address this
argument.
 
            C.        Re: Failure to State Prima Facie Case.
 
            Defendant argues
that Plaintiff cannot plead a prima facie case of libel per se because Defendant
did not publish any writing, printing, picture, effigy or other fixed representation.
 
            Based on the
ruling on the litigation privilege, above at 2.A., the Court does not address this
argument.
 
3.         Third Cause
of Action (Abuse of Process).
 
            A.        Re: Litigation Privilege.
 
            Defendant argues
that the litigation privilege bars this cause of action. See argument above at 1.A.
 
This cause of action is based on the foregoing statements made to Joy and
her counsel. (Complaint, ¶ 52.) The litigation privilege applies to an abuse of
process claim. (JSJ Limited Partnership
v. Mehrban (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 1512, 1522.)
 
            The motion for
judgment on the pleading is GRANTED without leave to amend as to the third
cause of action, unless Plaintiff can demonstrate a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. 
 
            B.        Re: Common Interest Privilege.
 
See argument above at 1.B.
 
            Based on the
ruling on the litigation privilege, above at 3.A., the Court does not address this
argument.
 
            C.        Re: Failure to State Prima Facie Case.
 
            Defendant argues
that Plaintiff cannot plead a prima facie case of abuse of process because she is
not a party to the underlying Trust matter, and has nothing to gain in that litigation.

 
            Plaintiff argues
that a defendant can commit the tort by knowingly facilitating or encouraging the
filing of a false claim. The fact that the claim is false both obviates protection
of the litigation privilege and in any case, the truth or falsity of the defense
is not provable on the face of the complaint.
 
            Based on the
ruling on the litigation privilege, above at 3.A., the Court does not address this
argument.
 
            Based on the
foregoing ruling, the Complaint is ordered dismissed with prejudice.
