Declaration of Zeyad Elalami reflects that Defendant in pro per satisfied the
meet and confer requirement set forth in Civ. Proc. Code, § 430.41.
Discussion
Defendant
Zeyad Elalami demurs to the First Amended Complaint as follows. The Court will
only address the causes of action to which Defendant demurred in the notice of
demurrer, and will not consider any causes of action discussed by Defendant for
the first time in the Reply.
1.         Third
Cause of Action (Negligence).
            Defendant
argues that Plaintiffs do not allege facts giving rise to a duty owed to
Plaintiffs.
 
[E]conomic damages, standing alone, can
be recovered under some circumstances in an action for negligence. "[A]n
injury to the plaintiff's economic interests should not go uncompensated merely
because it was unaccompanied by any injury to his person or property."
(Citations omitted.) Further, the reasoning of J'Aire is wholly incompatible
with a limitation of the cause of action to those instances in which the
plaintiff and defendant are not in privity, the secondary basis for the trial
court's ruling. 

Nevertheless, J'Aire does require that the parties have a "special
relationship" for such a cause of action to arise. (J'Aire, supra, 24 Cal.
3d at p. 804.) That special relationship must give rise to a duty on the part
of the defendant to use due care to avoid economic injury to the plaintiff.
(Id. at p. 803.) In the context of a motion for judgment on the pleadings, this
means the complaint must allege facts constituting such special relationship. .
. . 


(Ott v. Alfa-Laval Agri, Inc.
(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1439, 1448.)
            The
First Amended Complaint does not allege any facts giving rise to a special have
a duty to avoid economic injury to Plaintiffs.
            The
demurrer to the third cause of action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
2.         Fourth
Cause of Action (Financial Elder Abuse).
            Defendant
argues that there are no facts pled against him which constitute financial
elder abuse.
Financial abuse of an elder adult
“occurs when a person or entity does any of the following: [¶] (1) Takes,
secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains real or personal property of an
elder or dependent adult for a wrongful use or with intent to defraud, or both.
[¶] (2) Assists in taking, secreting, appropriating, obtaining, or retaining
real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult for a wrongful use or
with intent to defraud, or both.” (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.30, subd.
(a).)
The Elder Abuse and Dependent Adult
Civil Protection Act (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15600 et seq.) was enacted to
provide for the “private, civil enforcement of laws against elder abuse and
neglect” (Delaney v. Baker (1999) 20 Cal.4th 23, 33 [82 Cal. Rptr. 2d 610, 971
P.2d 986]). The statutory provisions are not limited to mentally incompetent or
physically impaired elders, or persons of limited financial means. (Welf. &
Inst. Code, §§ 15600, 15610.27, 15610.30.) Under the statute, it is not necessary
that the taker maintain an intent to defraud if it can be shown that the person
took the property for a wrongful use and “knew or should have known that [his
or her] conduct is likely to be harmful to the elder … .” (Id., § 15610.30,
subd. (b).) 
 
(Bonfigli v. Strachan (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 1302, 1315.)
            The
First Amended Complaint does not factually allege the element of financial
elder abuse as against demurring Defendant Elalami.           
            The
demurrer to the fourth cause of action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
3.         Fifth
Cause of Action (Unfair and Unlawful Business Practices).
            Defendant
argues that there are no acts pled against him which constitute an unfair
business practice, as he is not a landlord subject to Civil Code § 1950.5.
Because Business and Professions Code
section 17200 is in the disjunctive, it prohibits practices that are “unfair,”
“unlawful” or “fraudulent.” (Citations omitted.) Thus, it is unnecessary for a
business practice to be only unlawful in order for the conduct to be subject to
Business and Professions Code section 17200. (Citations omitted  [*257].)
The “unfair” standard is intentionally broad to allow courts to have maximum
discretion to prohibit schemes to defraud. (Citations omitted.) The unfairness
test has been described as follows: “Determination of whether a business practice
or act is ‘unfair’ within the meaning of the [Unfair Competition Act] entails
examination of the impact of the practice or act on its victim, ‘ “… balanced
against the reasons, justifications and motives of the alleged wrongdoer. In
brief, the court must weigh the utility of the defendant's conduct against the
gravity of the harm to the alleged victim … .” [Citation.]’ (Citation omitted.)
In general the ‘unfairness’ prong ‘has been used to enjoin deceptive or sharp
practices. …’ (Citations omitted.) An “unfair” business practice is actionable
under the unfair competition law even if it is not “deceptive” or “unlawful.”
(Citations omitted.) The term “fraud” is not predicated upon proof of the
common law tort of deceit or deception but simply means whether the public is
likely to be deceived. (Citations omitted.) 
In terms of unfair competition, any person or entity who has engaged in,
engages in, or threatens to engage in it may be enjoined from such misconduct.
(Bus. & Prof. Code, §§ 17201, 17203; . . ..) Whether particular conduct is
“unfair,” “unlawful” or “fraudulent” within the meaning of Business and
Professions Code section 17200 is generally a question of fact which depends on
the circumstances of each case. (Paduano v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (2009)
169 Cal.App.4th 1453, 1469 [88 Cal. Rptr. 3d 90] [“ ‘Whether a practice is
deceptive, fraudulent, or unfair is generally a question of fact which requires
“consideration and weighing of evidence from both sides” …’ ”]; McKell v.
Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1472 [49 Cal. Rptr. 3d
227] [“the determination is one question of fact, requiring consideration and
weighing of evidence from both sides …”].)
 
(Countrywide Financial Corp. v.
Bundy (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 234, 256-57.)
“A plaintiff alleging unfair
business practices under these statutes must state with reasonable
particularity the facts supporting the statutory elements of the
violation.”  (Khoury v. Maly's of
California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 619.)
            Here,
Plaintiffs do not allege with specificity what acts demurring Defendant Elalami
engaged in relative to Plaintiffs by which they suffered economic harm caused
by Defendant Elalami’s unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business practices. “In order to satisfy the Proposition 64
standing requirements, a party must establish an economic injury and in
addition ‘show that that economic injury was the result of, i.e., caused by, the unfair business practice … that
is the gravamen of the claim.’” (Law Offices of Mathew Higbee v.
Expungement Assistance Servs. (2013) 214 Cal. App. 4th
544, 562.)
            The
demurrer to the fifth cause of action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
4.         Sixth
Cause of Action (Violation of Los Angeles County Rent Stabilization and Tenant
Protections Ordinance).
            Defendant
argues that he did not deal with Plaintiffs as landlord.
            The
1AC alleges at ¶ 74 as follows:
74.
Defendants through their actions and inactions violated Los Angeles County Code
Section 8.52.010 et seq. by:  
 
A. Unlawful
and bad-faith retention of Plaintiff Pidlaoan’s and Plaintiff Bice’s security
deposits; 
 
B. Attempting
to influence Plaintiffs to waive or forgo rights related to their tenancies
through fraud, misrepresentation, and coercion; and 
 
C. Violating
Welfare and Institutions Code section 15610.30.
            Defendant
Elalami is not alleged to have been Plaintiffs’ landlord. To the extent that he
negotiated on behalf of the landlords, this would merely render him their
agent, subject to the agent’s immunity rule. “ ‘[U]nder the agent's
immunity rule, an agent is not liable for conspiring with the principal when
the agent is acting in an official capacity on behalf of the principal.’
[Citations.]” (Citation omitted.)”  (Panoutsopoulos
v. Chambliss (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 297, 304.)
            The
demurrer to the sixth cause of action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
            Plaintiffs
are given 30 days’ leave to amend.
