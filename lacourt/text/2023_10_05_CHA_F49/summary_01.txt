And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by defendants Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage Company and Mariana Vassilev. The demurrer to the first, second, fourth, and fifth causes of action for fraud and concealment, negligent misrepresentation, constructive fraud, and unfair business practices is moot, as the court previously sustained the demurrer to these causes of action. The court has sustained the demurrer to the nuisance cause of action, citing the lack of specifically articulated conduct constituting nuisance. The motion to strike is also moot.

The court grants the plaintiff 27 days leave to amend the complaint to address the nuisance cause of action. The plaintiff may file a single amended complaint as to all parties at the same time. However, the plaintiff is not permitted to add new causes of action and is only allowed to add additional facts. The court will not accept any additional pleadings beyond the single amended pleading, and any new causes of action added without leave from the court are subject to a motion to strike.
