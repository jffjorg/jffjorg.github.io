And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has ruled that the City of La Habra's demurrer to the complaint filed by Haichang Lu and Yankun Zhang is overruled. The City had argued that the complaint failed to allege a statutory basis for the City's liability. However, the court found that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to state a cause of action against the City, citing Government Code section 815.2, subdivision (a). The court ruled that the City's failure to provide a statutory basis for liability and the City's failure to argue that the plaintiff's allegations were insufficient were sufficient to overrule the demurrer. The court ordered the City to file its answer in 10 days.
