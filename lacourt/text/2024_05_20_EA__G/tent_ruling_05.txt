TENTATIVE RULING
Defendant City of La
Habra’s Demurrer to Plaintiffs Haichang Lu and Yankun Zhang’s Complaint is OVERRULED.
The City is ordered to
file its Answer in ten (10) days.
BACKGROUND
This
is a personal injury action arising from an automobile collision. In December
2022, Defendant James Delvin Vlietstra collided with Plaintiffs Haichang Lu and
Yankun Zhang’s vehicle while operating a vehicle eastbound on State Route 60 in
Diamond Bar.
On
January 2, 2024, Lu and Zhang filed a complaint against Vlietstra, the City of
La Habra (the City), and Does 1-10, alleging (1) motor vehicle negligence and
(2) general negligence.
On April
2, 2024, the City filed the present demurrer. Prior to filing on March 25, 2024,
the City’s counsel met and conferred telephonically with Lu and Zhang’s
counsel. (Spearman Decl., ¶ 4.)
A hearing
on the demurrer is set for May 20, 2024, along with a case management
conference and OSC Re: Failure to File Proof of Service on May 28, 2024.
ANALYSIS
The
City demurs to Lu and Zhang’s entire Complaint on the grounds that the
Complaint fails to allege a statutory basis for the City’s liability. For the
following reasons, the Court OVERRULES the City’s demurrer.
Legal Standard
Demurrer
A
party may demur to a complaint on the grounds that it “does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.
(e).) A demurrer tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747 (Hahn).) When considering
demurrers, courts accept all well pleaded facts as true. (Fox v. JAMDAT
Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) In a demurrer proceeding,
the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face
of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court
(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, at p. 747.)
Public Entity Liability
“[I]n
California, all governmental tort liability is dependent upon the existence of
an authorizing statute or ‘enactment.’” (Searcy v. Hemet Unified School
Dist. (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 792, 798.) Pursuant to Government Code section
815.2, subdivision (a), “A public entity is liable for injury proximately
caused by an act or omission of an employee of the public entity within the
scope of his employment if the act or omission would, apart from this section,
have given rise to a cause of action against that employee or his personal
representative.”
Discussion
In
this case, the City argues the Complaint fails to allege the statutory basis
for the City’s liability. (Demurrer, p. 3:5-19.) While the City is correct in
arguing such a statutory basis must exist, the City fails to provide any
authority that requires a pleading to state the specific statute. Instead, the court
finds the Complaint alleges sufficient facts to state a cause of action against
a public entity pursuant to Government Code section 815.2, subdivision (a). As
noted above, this section allows a public entity to be held liable for injuries
caused by its employees while acting within their scope of employment if they
themselves can be held liable.
Here,
the Complaint allege Vlietstra was an employee of the City who was acting
within the scope of the City’s employment when Vlietstra collided with Lu and
Zhang. (Complaint, p. 4.) Because the City does not argue the Complaint fails
to state a cause of action for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence against
Vlietstra, the court finds these allegations are sufficient to establish the
City’s liability for Vlietstra’s collision pursuant to Government Code section
815.2, subdivision (a).
Accordingly,
the City’s demurrer is OVERRULED.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the
City’s demurrer to Lu and Zhang’s Complaint is OVERRULED.
The City is ordered to file
its Answer in ten (10) days.
