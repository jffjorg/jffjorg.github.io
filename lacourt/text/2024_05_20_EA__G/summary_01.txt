And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff, Rebecca Castillo, default judgment against the defendant, PD&D Group LLC, in the amount of $4,834.00. The case involves allegations of disability rights violations, including inaccessible website design and lack of alternative text for screen-reading software. The plaintiff alleges that she faced barriers to access on the defendant's website and was deterred from accessing the website and physical storefront. However, the court finds that the plaintiff failed to establish a specific instance of deterrence and therefore declines to award $4,000 in deterrence damages. The court reduces the requested attorney fees to $330. The judge grants the plaintiff's application for default judgment in the reduced amount of $4,834.00.
