 Case Number:  23PSCV03763    Hearing Date:   May 20, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Gironi Investments, Inc.’s Application for
Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Gironi Investments, Inc.’s Application for
Default Judgment is GRANTED in the
reduced amount of $1,500,864.98.
BACKGROUND
This
is a breach of contract action arising from an investment agreement. In August 2021,
Plaintiff Gironi Investments, Inc. (Gironi) invested $1,500,000.00 in Defendant
Octavius Group Holdings, Inc. (Octavius) pursuant to a written agreement in
which Gironi was given the right to convert the investment into future stock.
Gironi also entered into a separate agreement with Octavius in which Gironi
would be given access to the same information as Octavius’s current major
investors, notice of future financing, and the right to pro rata participation
in future financing. Following Gironi’s investment, a series of events began to
cause Gironi concern including a reduction in Octavius’ valuation, the
collapse of a merger and investment deal, and the cancellation of a planned
stock offering. Gironi alleges Octavius breached their agreements by failing to
provide requested information and documents which resulted in the loss of new
investment opportunities for Gironi.
On December
5, 2023, Gironi filed a complaint against Octavius alleging the following
causes of action: (1) breach of contract, (2) specific performance, and (3)
declaratory relief. On December 20, 2023, Gironi’s process server personally
served Octavius in Covina.
On
January 29, 2024, the Court entered default against Octavius after Octavius
failed to file a timely answer. On March 14, 2024, Gironi submitted the present
application for default judgment.
A case
management conference is set for May 20, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Gironi
seeks default judgment against Octavius in the total amount of $1,502,691.29,
including $1,500,000.00 in damages, $1,826.31 in attorney fees, and $864.98 in
costs. Because the Court finds Gironi has submitted sufficient evidence, the Court
GRANTS Gironi’s application for default judgment with the following
modification. While Gironi requests an award of attorney fees in the present
default judgment application, the Court declines to award such fees as they
were not requested in the Complaint. (Feminist Women’s Health Center v.
Blythe (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1641, 1675 [“If plaintiff believed it was
entitled by statute to attorney fees, it had to allege that fact in its
complaint and demand the fees in the prayer in order to obtain such relief
against any defaulting defendants.”].)
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Gironi’s application for default
judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $1,500,864.98.
Gironi to submit a judgment consistent with the ruling above on or before May 23, 2024.
