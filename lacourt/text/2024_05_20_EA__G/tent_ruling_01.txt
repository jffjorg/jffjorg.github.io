  Case Number:  22PSCV01892    Hearing Date:   May 20, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Rebecca  Castillo’s Application for Default Judgment Respondent: NO OPPOSITIONTENTATIVE RULING Plaintiff Rebecca  Castillo’s Application for Default Judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of  $4,834.00. BACKGROUND This  is a disability rights action. Plaintiff Rebecca Castillo is a visually  impaired and legally blind individual. Defendant PD&D Group LLC (PD&D)  is a California LLC that operates a commercial website available to the public. As  early as September 2022, Castillo visited PD&D’s website multiple times and  alleges the following barriers to access existed: (1) graphics, links, and  buttons on the website were mislabeled or lacked alternative text (alt-text)  for screen-reading software to read out; (2) multiple pages contained  insufficient navigational headings; (3) menu links and descriptions were  inaccessible to screen reading technology, and (4) the checkout system was  inaccessible. On  November 18, 2022, Castillo filed a complaint for damages and injunctive relief  against PD&D and Does 1-10, alleging violations of the Unruh Civil Rights  Act (UCRA). On December 15, Castillo’s registered process server personally  served PD&D’s agent for the service of process in Fountain Valley. On  February 14, 2023, the Court entered default against PD&D after they failed  to file a timely answer. On June 9, 2023, Castillo submitted an application for default judgment. On July 11,  2023, the Court denied Castillo’s application. On September 21, 2023, Castillo filed a First  Amended Complaint (FAC) against the same defendants alleging the same causes of  action. On October 1, 2023, Castillo’s process server personally served PD&D’s agent for  the service of process in Fountain Valley. On February  7, 2024, the Court entered default against PD&D after they failed to file a  timely answer. On March 29, 2024, Castillo submitted the present application  for default judgment. An  OSC Re: Default/Default Judgment is set for May 20, 2024. LEGAL STANDARD Code  of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a  party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on  the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a  brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in  support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)  a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a  dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application  for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for  each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees  if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of  Court 3.1800.) ANALYSIS Castillo  seeks default judgment against PD&D in the total amount of $9,074,  including $8,000 in damages, $570 in attorney fees, and $504 in costs. While the  Court finds Castillo has submitted sufficient evidence, Castillo’s application  is GRANTED  with the  following modifications. In  addition to $4,000 in statutory damages for the alleged violations, Castillo  also seeks $4,000 in deterrence damages. Generally, a plaintiff may obtain  statutory damages for UCRA violations “if the plaintiff personally encountered  the violation on a particular occasion, or the plaintiff was deterred from  accessing a place of public accommodation on a particular occasion.” (Civ.  Code, § 55.56, subd. (b).) To establish that a plaintiff was deterred,  plaintiff must establish that plaintiff had actual knowledge of the violations  and that the violations would have denied plaintiff “full and equal access” on  that occasion. (Civ. Code, § 55.56, subd. (d).) Courts  have awarded deterrence damages in addition to statutory damages for UCRA  violations when plaintiffs seek damages for one encounter with violations and  one instance of deterrence. (See, e.g., Johnson v. Guedoir (E.D.  Cal. 2016) 218 F.Supp.3d 1096, 1103.) But courts have declined to award  additional deterrence damages when plaintiffs fail to establish they were  deterred on a specific occasion and instead rely on a conclusory claim  that they were deterred from patronizing a business. (Filardi v. Starbucks #  8709 (C.D. Cal. July 5, 2018, No. 5:18–CV–00404–ODW–SP) 2018 WL 3303316,  *4; Ho v. BSG Sunflower Investments, LLC (C.D. Cal. Nov. 30, 2017, No.  8:17-cv-00863-JLS-JCG) 2017 WL 11633694, *7.) Here,  Castillo alleges Castillo faced barriers when Castillo visited PD&D’s website on  September 2, 2022, and September 3, 2022. (FAC, ¶ 38.) But such barriers did  not deter Castillo from visiting PD&D’s physical storefront as Castillo  subsequently did so on September 7, 2023. (FAC, ¶ 40.) While Castillo makes the  general and conclusory allegation that Castillo has been deterred from  accessing PD&D’s website and physical storefront, Castillo has failed to  allege a specific instance of deterrence. (FAC, ¶ 42.) Thus, the Court declines  to award $4,000 in deterrence damages and accordingly reduces the requested  attorney fees to $330. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, Castillo’s  application for default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $4,834.00.
