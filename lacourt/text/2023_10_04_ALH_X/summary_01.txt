And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to discovery requests in a lemon law case. The plaintiffs, Alma Grajales and Freddy Hernandez, filed a complaint against American Honda Motor Co., Inc. on September 14, 2022, alleging a breach of express warranty under the Song-Beverly Act. The plaintiffs served discovery requests on November 13, 2022, and the defendant served deficient responses on December 15, 2022. The plaintiffs moved to compel further responses to the discovery requests, which the defendant opposed.

The judge granted the motion to compel further responses as to special interrogatories numbers 25 and 31, which relate to the defendant's training on evaluating eligibility for a vehicle repurchase and its policies and procedures for complying with the Song-Beverly Act. The judge denied the motion as to special interrogatories numbers 30, 42, 46, 47, and 48, and requests for production numbers 45 and 46, which relate to the defendant's tracking of repurchases, maintenance of a qualified third-party dispute resolution process, and repair data.

The judge also denied the plaintiffs' request for sanctions. The parties are directed to give notice of their intention to submit on this tentative ruling.
