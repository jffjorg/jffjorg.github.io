 Case Number:  24STCV19666    Hearing Date:   November 14, 2024    Dept:  57 The demurrer of Defendant Tesla Insurance Services, Inc. ("TIS") to the fifth cause of action for trespass to chattel and sixth cause of action for unfair and unlawful business practices in violation of Business and Professions Code Section 17200 in Plaintiff's complaint is overruled.  TIS contends that the claim for trespass to chattel is duplicative of the fourth claim for conversion and hence is subject to a demurrer.  The Court disagrees.  Trespass to chattel and conversion are separate and distinct torts.  The complaint adequately sets forth the elements of both claims, which are pled as alternative theories of liability for TIS's alleged exercise of custody and control over Plaintiff's automobile.TIS fares no better in its demurrer to the claim for violation of Section 17200.  In the Court's view, the complaint satisfies the lenient pleading standards for a Section 17200 violation.  Specifically, the allegations regarding TIS's exercise of custody and control over Plaintiff's automobile support a clam for  a Section 17200 violation.The Court is denying TIS's motion to strike the allegations in the complaint connected to Plaintiff's prayer for an award of punitive damages and the prayer itself.  In the Court's view, the allegations supporting the conversion claim, it true,  also would support an award of punitive damages on that claim.Defendants are to file and serve and answer to the complaint by December 2, 2024.  The case management conference set for January 15, 2025 remains on calendar.
