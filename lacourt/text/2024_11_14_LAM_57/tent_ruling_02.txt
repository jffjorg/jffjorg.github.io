 Case Number:  23STCV07767    Hearing Date:   November 14, 2024    Dept:  57 Plaintiffs' motion to compel Defendant Carolwood Homeowners Association to produce further documents is denied. The Court disagrees with Plaintiffs' contention in their supplemental brief that Defendants' most recent production in response to certain delineated requests for production is incomplete.  And the Court rejects the premise in the supplemental brief that Defendant has to be withholding from production documents that are responsive to other delineated requests for production.   Under the circumstances that have led the parties and the Court to this juncture, the Court also is denying Plaintiffs' request for an order imposing sanctions against Defendant and its counsel.   The Court does not discern a misuse of the discovery process or bad faith on Defendant's part in connection with this protracted discovery dispute.
