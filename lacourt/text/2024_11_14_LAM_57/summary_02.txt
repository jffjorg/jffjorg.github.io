The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel the Carolwood Homeowners Association to produce additional documents. The judge disagrees with the plaintiff's argument that the association's latest production was incomplete and rejects the idea that the association is withholding documents that are responsive to other requests. Additionally, the judge has denied the plaintiff's request for an order imposing sanctions against the association and its counsel, finding no evidence of misuse of the discovery process or bad faith.
