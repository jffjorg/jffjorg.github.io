And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Doe v. Olson, et al., Case No. SC128027. The defendant, Chateau Colline Homeowners Association, has moved to compel the plaintiffs, May Doe and Jane Doe, to provide verified responses to Form Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories. The court has granted the motion as to May Doe, ordering her to provide responses to Form Interrogatories 2.1, 2.2, 2.5, 2.6(b), and 2.7, and to Form Interrogatories 4.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, and 6.7.

As to Jane Doe, the court has also granted the motion, ordering her to provide responses to Form Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories. The court has also awarded sanctions against both plaintiffs in the amount of $1,867.26, which includes $60 for the filing fee and $7.26 for the IDC filing fee.

The court has denied Chateau Colline's request for $3,800 in sanctions against each plaintiff, finding that the amount requested is excessive. The court has also denied Chateau Colline's request for nine hours of meeting and conferring time, finding that this was a legitimate discovery dispute.

The court's tentative ruling is subject to change upon receipt of any opposition or reply.
