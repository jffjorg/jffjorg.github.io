And here is the English text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Hamo v. Villa Cannon Homeowners Association (HOA), Case No. 24SMCV01819. The HOA demurred to the entire complaint, arguing each cause of action fails to state a claim and is uncertain. The judge overruled the demurrer for uncertainty, finding that the complaint is not incomprehensible and properly states a cause for action for defamation. The HOA also moved to strike the prayer for punitive damages, which the judge granted, finding that the allegations presently are not sufficient to support punitive damages.

The judge found that the HOA owes Hamo a fiduciary duty of care and that the complaint properly states a cause for action for defamation at the pleading stage. However, the judge sustained the HOA's demurrer to the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, finding that the allegations do not meet the standard for outrageous conduct.

The judge granted the HOA's motion to strike the request for punitive damages, finding that the allegations presently are not sufficient to support punitive damages. The judge ordered Hamo to file an amended complaint within 15 days and may amend to allege punitive damages.
