And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Essex Property Trust, Inc. is granted leave to file a cross-complaint for breach of contract against Johnson. The cross-complaint is compulsory because it alleges a related cause of action against Johnson arising out of her tenancy. Essex had sought leave to file the cross-complaint after a settlement was reached in an unlawful detainer action, which did not dispose of the unpaid rent claims. The judge agrees that the motion was not brought in bad faith, as Essex believed the settlement addressed the back rent claims, but the parties agreed Essex could still pursue those claims.
