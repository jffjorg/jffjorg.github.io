 Case Number:  23CHCV01244    Hearing Date:   July 9, 2024    Dept:  F51  JULY 8, 2024    MOTION FOR SUMMARY  JUDGMENT  Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 23CHCV01244    Motion Filed: 4/17/24                                                                               JURY TRIAL: 8/5/24   MOVING PARTY: Defendants Christopher Johnson;  and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (collectively, “Defendants”) RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Maryam Haidari  (“Plaintiff”) NOTICE: OK    RELIEF REQUESTED: An  order granting summary judgment in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiff on  Plaintiff’s complaint.   TENTATIVE RULING: The motion is denied.   BACKGROUND   This is a personal injury  action in which Plaintiff alleges that on 5/29/22, while riding her bicycle,  she was injured in a collision with Defendant Johnson’s vehicle at the  intersection of Oso Avenue and Saticoy Street, Los Angeles, California. (Compl.  ¶ 1.) Plaintiff further alleges that Johnson was acting within the scope of his  employment with Defendant JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. at the time of the  subject collision. (Id. at ¶¶ 7–8.)   On 4/28/23, Plaintiff filed her  complaint against Defendants, alleging a sole cause of action for Negligence.  On 6/27/23, Defendants filed their answers.   On 4/17/24,  Defendants filed the instant motion for summary judgment. On 6/25/24, Plaintiff  filed her opposition. On 7/3/23, Defendants filed their reply.   ANALYSIS     The function of a motion for  summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an  opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to  enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v.  Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure  section 437c, subdivision (c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary  judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably  deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or  evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that  the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.  Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of  the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the  issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether  there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the  pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 65,  citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367,  381–382.)    As to each claim as framed  by the complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the  initial burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or  to establish a defense. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); Scalf v. D.  B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519–1520.)     Once the defendant has met  that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of  one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense  thereto. To establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the  motion must produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68  Cal.App.4th 151, 163.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of  the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence  in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006) 39  Cal.4th 384, 389.)    A.     Evidentiary Objections   The court has reviewed the evidentiary objections  submitted by the parties. While all objections have been considered, due to  their extensive nature, the Court will not address each objection individually  in this tentative ruling. Instead, the Court's analysis will focus on the  substance of the objections raised and their relevance to the determination of  the motion at hand.      B.      Negligence   Plaintiff’s sole cause of action against Defendants is  Negligence. To state a claim for negligence, a plaintiff must allege the  elements of (1) “the existence of a legal duty of care,” (2) “breach of that  duty,” and (3) “proximate cause resulting in an injury.” (McIntyre v.  Colonies-Pacific, LLC (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 664, 671.)   Here,  Defendants argue that they “are not liable to Plaintiff under a Motor Vehicle  Negligence theory because it is Plaintiff who caused the incident as a matter  of law by running a red light and driving on the wrong side of the roadway, and  Defendant Johnson, in stark contrast, drove through the intersection pursuant  to a green light after looking both ways, exercising due care.” (MSJ 8:14–17.)  Defendants contend that Johnson, exercising due care in driving through the  intersection, was legally stopped at his red stoplight, and when the light  turned green, saw that the intersection was clear to proceed through, and only  first saw Plaintiff at the moment just before impact. (Id. at 4:12–16,  5:6–9.)    1.       Plaintiff’s Comparative Negligence   Defendants  argue that Plaintiff ran a red light, on the wrong side of the roadway, as  corroborated by four independent third party witnesses and the police report. (MSJ  10:6–11:14.) Defendants therefore contend that “Plaintiff’s act of running a  red light caused the impact, which caused Plaintiff’s physical injuries. Had  Plaintiff not run a red light, she would not have been in the roadway with  oncoming traffic coming towards her, and no impact or injury would have occurred.”  (Id. at 11:16–19.)   In  opposition, Plaintiff argues that “in comparative negligence cases (such as  this one), a plaintiff’s purported negligence cannot, as a matter of law,  obliviate Defendant’s own negligence.” (Pl.’s Opp. 1:8–9.) Plaintiff further  asserts that “this case presents material factual disputes that must  necessarily be decided by a jury to appropriately apportion liability: (1)  whether Defendant Johnson was negligent in failing to observe Plaintiff in the  crosswalk and (2) whether Plaintiff had the right of way under Vehicle Code §  21451.” (Id. at 6:4–7.)   “Courts are  very reluctant to uphold a summary judgment in comparative negligence cases. … Ordinarily,  issues of negligence are jury questions and the court may rarely decide  comparative negligence questions without submitting them to the jury. … In  short, negligence is a question of fact if different conclusions can be  rationally drawn from the evidence.” (Maxwell v. Colburn (1980) 105  Cal.App.3d 180, 186 [internal quotations and citations omitted].)   Plaintiff  argues that “whether or not a vehicle with a green light [has the right of way]  depends upon whether another vehicle or pedestrian was lawfully in the  intersection previously.” (Pl.’s Opp. 7:24–26, citing Veh. Code § 21451, subd. (a);  People v. Hahn (1950) 98 Cal.App.2d Supp. 841, 843–844; Freeman v.  Churchill (1947) 30 Cal.2d 453, 459.) Here, Plaintiff proffers her own  deposition testimony, and an expert declaration (albeit lacking foundation in  many areas) and surveillance camera footage purporting to show that Plaintiff  began crossing the intersection during her green light, while Defendant was  stopped at his red light, turned around to retrieve a sweater she had dropped, before  again proceeding to cross the intersection while her light was still green. (Ex.  1 to Decl. of Colleen M. Mullen, 52:20–56:9; Exs. 4–10 to Decl. of Jon B.  Landerville, MSME, P.E.)   Plaintiff  therefore contends that “here, there is a triable issue of fact as to whether  Plaintiff, who lawfully entered the intersection with a green light, had the  right of way pursuant to Vehicle Code § 21451(a).” (Pl.’s Opp. 8:4–5.) The  Court agrees and finds that Plaintiff has met her responsive evidentiary burden  to show that a triable issue of fact exists as to Plaintiff’s own potential  comparative negligence, as different conclusions as to whether Plaintiff ran a  red light can be rationally drawn from the evidence.   2.       Defendant’s Breach of the Duty to Exercise Reasonable  Care   “The  general duty to take ordinary care in the conduct of one’s activities … indisputably  applies to the operation of a motor vehicle.” (Cabral v. Ralphs Grocery Co.  (2011) 51 Cal.4th 764, 774, citing Civ. Code, § 1714, subd. (a).) Here,  Defendants argue that Johnson exercised reasonable care at all relevant times  as he drove through the intersection. (MSJ 12:16–19.) Defendants support their  contentions with Johnson’s deposition testimony, third-party witness  declarations, and LAPD Officer Solis’ deposition testimony.   In  opposition, Plaintiff maintains that “it is for the jury to decide whether the  reliance upon another’s due care is reasonable.” (Pl.’s Opp. 6:23–24, citing Hendricks  v. Pappas (1947) 82 Cal.App.2d 774, 778.) Plaintiff argues that “here,  there is a material dispute of fact as to whether Defendant Johnson was  negligent in failing to observe and account for Plaintiff crossing the  intersection when he had a green light.” (Id. at 6:27–28.) Plaintiff  asserts that there was nothing obstructing Defendant’s field of vision, and  thus his view of the intersection, through which Plaintiff was crossing prior  to the collision. (Id. at 7:1–3.) In support of this contention,  Plaintiff proffers the deposition testimony of both Johnson and LAPD Officer  Solis, and her expert’s declaration. Plaintiff argues that “under these  circumstances, a jury may find that Defendant Johnson’s negligence – in failing  to observe Plaintiff for over ten seconds in the crosswalk directly in front of  him – rather than Plaintiff’s purported negligence in continuing to cross an  intersection she lawfully entered caused Plaintiff’s injuries.” (Id. at 9:22–25.)     The Court  agrees. While Defendants dispute the credibility of Plaintiff’s expert  declaration, the Court finds that Plaintiff has met her responsive evidentiary  burden to show that a triable issue exists as to whether Johnson breached his  duty of reasonable care, and likewise whether his conduct was a substantial  factor in causing Plaintiff’s injuries. Accordingly, the motion for summary  judgment is denied.   C.     Vicarious  Liability   “An employer is vicariously  liable for the torts of employees committed within the course or scope of their  employment.” (Alma W. v. Oakland Unified School District (1981) 123  Cal.App.3d 133, 138–139.) As the Court finds that triable issues exist as to  the nature and degree of each party’s comparative negligence, and the parties  have not raised any issues regarding whether Johnson’s conduct was committed  within the scope of his employment, it finds that a triable issue remains as to  whether JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is vicariously liable for Johnson’s  conduct.   CONCLUSION   The motion is denied.
