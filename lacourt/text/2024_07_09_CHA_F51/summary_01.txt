And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion for a protective order is granted in part. The defendants, Ramon Lopez and Yolanda Cruz, are ordered to serve code-compliant responses to the plaintiff's special interrogatories, set one, nos. 72-82, within 30 days. The Court declines to impose monetary sanctions on either party. The ruling is based on the complexity and quantity of the existing and potential issues in the case, and the Court finds that the plaintiff's supporting declaration does not provide sufficient factual showing to justify the number of interrogatories.
