And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has considered the motion for reconsideration filed by Respondent Isaac Musighi (aka Eshagh Musighi) regarding the denial of his motion to set aside judgment. The Respondent argues that new facts have been uncovered that shed new light on the matter, but the Judge finds that these facts were available to the Respondent when he filed the original motion and that he did not present them earlier with a valid justification. Therefore, the Judge declines to reconsider the denial of the motion to set aside judgment and denies the Respondent's motion for reconsideration.
