  CASE NO.:  23STCV23703
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO
  REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION AND REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS
 
Date: January 16, 2025
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 
 



 
MOVING
PARTY:  Plaintiff Mary Kate Leibman
(“Plaintiff”)
RESPONDING
PARTY: Defendant Roberta Magid, Trustee of the Robert Magid Trust (“Defendant”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
            Plaintiff brought this habitability
action on November 3, 2023. The operative first amended complaint (“FAC”)
alleges causes of action for: (1) breach of contract; (2) tortious violation of
breach of warranty of habitability; (3) private nuisance; (4) violation of
Civil Code § 1942.4; (5) negligence; (6) intentional infliction of emotional
distress; and (7) negligent infliction of emotional distress.  
 
            On November 19, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant motion to compel further responses to requests for production
(“RFPs”) and request for sanctions (the “Motion”). Defendant filed an
opposition on January 3, 2025 (the “Opposition”). Plaintiff filed a reply (the
“Reply”) on January 9, 2025. 
 
JUDICIAL NOTICE 
            Pursuant
to Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (d), the Court may take judicial
notice of “[r]ecords of (1) any court of this state or (2) any court of record
of the United States or of any state of the United States”. 
 
The court,
however, may not take judicial notice of the truth of the contents of the
documents. (Herrera v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2011) 196
Cal.App.4th 1366, 1375.) Documents are only judicially noticeable to show their
existence and what orders were made such that the truth of the facts and
findings within the documents are not judicially noticeable. (Lockley v. Law
Office of Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th
875, 885.)     
            
Pursuant to Defendant’s
request, the Court takes judicial notice of the following: (1) Plaintiff’s FAC
(RJN, Ex. A); and (2) the Minute Order from Informal Discovery Conference on
July 18, 2024 (RJN, Ex. B).  The Court
notes for future reference that it is not necessary to request judicial notice
of matters filed in the case in which the subject motion is filed.
 
 
MEET AND CONFER 
             The parties have satisfied the meet and confer
requirement. 
 
DISCUSSION
A motion to compel a further response is
used when a party gives unsatisfactory answers or makes untenable objections to
interrogatories, demands to produce, or requests for admission. (Code of Civil
Procedure (“CCP”), § 2031.310, subd. (a); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)
 
To request further production, a movant
must establish: (1) good cause for the production (CCP, § 2031.310, subd.
(b)(1); Sinaiko, supra, at p. 403); and (2) that a further
response is needed because (a) the responding party’s statement of compliance
with the demand to produce is incomplete CCP, § 2031.310, subd. (a)(1)), (b)
the responding party’s representation that it is unable to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive (CCP, § 2031.310, subd. (a)(2)), (c) the
responding party’s objection in the response is without merit or is too general
(CCP, § 2031.310, subd. (a)(3); Catalina Island Yacht Club v. Superior Court
(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1127), or (d) if the responding party objected to
the production of ESI on the ground that it is not reasonably accessible the
movant can show that the (i) ESI is reasonably accessible or (ii) there is good
cause for production of the ESI regardless of its accessibility (CCP, §
2031.310, subd. (e)).
 
            Plaintiff seeks to compel further responses
to RFP Nos. 4-6, 10-12, and 16. The RFPs seek all documents relating to any
time mold has been present or claimed to be present at 917 N. Larrabee Street (the
“Subject Property”) between 2013 and present (RFP Nos. 4, 10), all documents
relating to any time water leaks, intrusion or moisture have been present or
claimed at the Subject Property between 2013 and present, (RFP Nos. 5, 11), all
documents relating to any dampness of floors, ceilings or walls at the Subject
Property between 2013 and present (RFP Nos. 6, 12) and all documents relating
to health or safety violations at the Subject Property between 2013 and present
(RFP No. 16). 
 
            On July 18, 2024, the Court issued a
stipulation and order which states, in relevant part: “Requests for Production
Nos. 1-13, 16-18 and 21to mold and water leaks in Units 6 and 20 for the period
for five years before and throughout Plaintiff’s tenancy of the building. With
regard to the Decision of the Hearing Examiner of the City of West Hollywood
Rent Stabilization Unit dated July 10, 2024 (the “Decision”), Defendants are
reviewing the Decision and will inform Plaintiff within ten days as to whether
they will also include in the Responses all documents responsive to mold and
water leaks in common areas as reported in the Decision.” (7/18/2024 Minute
Order) Defendant served amended responses to discovery on August 16, 2024 (Kurtz
Decl. ¶ 5; Segal Decl., ¶ 6). Defendant served additional discovery responses
on September 20, 2024 (Kurtz Decl. ¶ 9; Segal Decl., ¶ 6). Defendant asserts
that they have produced all available documents within the scope of the July
18, 2024 stipulation and order. (Kurtz Decl. ¶ 17; Segal Decl., ¶ 6). Defendant
further argues that Plaintiff has not identified which documents she is
requesting or that she believes are missing from the documents produced. (Opp.
p. 4:13-28.)  
 
            In the  Reply, Plaintiff argues that she received
additional responsive documents from the City of West Hollywood and that “ the
existence of these West Hollywood documents (which prove that documents are
missing) and the large categories of documents that one would expect a landlord
and attorney to retain regarding the apartment complex that Plaintiff’s counsel
provided in October 2024 are clear indications that documents are missing from
Defendant’s productions.” (Reply, p. 5:4-7.) 
 
            The Court finds Plaintiff’s assertion
that other documents must exist, without further specification of those
documents, insufficient to establish good cause. To the extent the City of West
Hollywood produced additional responsive documents, Plaintiff is now in possession
of these documents so further production of the same documents would be
redundant. Accordingly, Plaintiff has not established good cause for further
production or good cause to expand the scope of the July 18, 2024 stipulation
and order.  
 
            The Motion is DENIED. 
 
Request
for Sanctions 
Except in certain circumstances involving
electronic stored information, the court must impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further
response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. (CCP, § 2031.310, subd. (h).)
 
The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed. (Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
 
Even after a party provides discovery
responses, a party can keep its motion on calendar and the court has authority
to grant sanctions, even if it denies the motion to compel responses “as
essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part.” (Sinaiko, supra, at p.
409.)
 
            Plaintiff
seeks sanctions in the amount of $7,600.00 against Defendant and/or Defendant’s
counsel of record. Because the Court has denied Plaintiff’s Motion, Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions is DENIED. Considering Defendant did not request reciprocal
sanctions in the Opposition, the Court finds that imposing sanctions against
Plaintiff would be unjust. 
             
            Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further
Production, and Request for Sanctions, is DENIED. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
Dated this 16th day of January 2025
