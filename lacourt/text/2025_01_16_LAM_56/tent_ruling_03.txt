  CASE NO.:  BS168107
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
 
Date: January 16, 2025
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 
 



 
MOVING PARTY:  Respondent ISAAC MUSIGHI (“Respondent”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Petitioner
DANIEL MOSSIGHI (“Petitioner”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
             This action stems from a long-standing dispute
between Petitioner and Respondent, who are brothers and former business
partners. Together, they operated Pacific M. International Corp. dba PMI
diamonds (“PMI”), a wholesale diamond business. The parties thereafter had
disagreements related to PMI’s management and finances and they agreed to
submit their dispute to binding arbitration. On October 11, 2017, this Court
confirmed the arbitrator’s award and entered judgment in favor of Petitioner
(the “Judgment”). 
 
On September 6, 2024, Respondent filed a motion
to set aside judgment and permit the filing of a cross-complaint. The Court
denied the motion to set aside on October 16, 2024. (10/16/24 Minute Order.) 
 
On October 22, 2024, Respondent filed the
instant motion for reconsideration of the motion to set aside (the “Motion”). Respondent
filed various additional declarations and evidence on December 27 and 30, 2024
and on January 3, 2025. Petitioner filed an opposition on January 3, 2025 (the
“Opposition”) and Respondent filed a reply on January 9, 2025 (the “Reply”). 
 
EVIDENTIARY
OBJECTIONS 
             Petitioner objects to several portions of
Respondent’s declaration and exhibits, as well as to the late-filed
declarations and exhibits. 
 
Petitioner’s objections to paragraphs 5 through
38 of the declaration attached to the Motion are SUSTAINED on the ground that
these paragraphs consist of arguments rather than facts. 
 
Petitioner’s objections to the declarations,
transcripts, and exhibits filed on December 27 and 30, 2024 and January 3, 2025,
are SUSTAINED on the ground that these items were not timely filed. 
 


 
DISCUSSION
A motion for reconsideration is used to
ask the court to modify, amend, or revoke its earlier order on a prior motion
to the court because of new or different facts, circumstances, or law. (Code
Civil Procedure (“CCP”), § 1008, subd. (a).) Such an order may involve an
interim or final order (CCP, § 1008, subds. (e), (h)), where an interim order
is an intermediate ruling of some kind that requires further proceedings before
the suit can be resolved, and where a final order is an order that finally
disposes of the suit (see People v. DeLouize (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1223,
1231 [differentiating between interim and final orders]).  
 
            A party may move for reconsideration
based on: (1) new or different facts, (CCP, § 1008, subd. (a); see e.g., In
re Marriage of LaMoure (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 1463, 1473 [reconsideration
motion granted on new evidence]); (2) new or different circumstances, (CCP, §
1008, subd. (a)); and (3) new or different law, (CCP, § 1008, subd. (a); Baldwin
v. Home Sav. of Am. (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1192, 1196.) However, a party
cannot move reconsideration based on the court’s erroneous order, i.e., the
court’s misinterpretation of facts or law. (See Jones v. P.S. Dev. Co.
(2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 707, 724, disapproved on other grounds by Reid v. Google,
Inc. (2010) 50 Cal.4th 512, 531-532, 532 n. 4.) 
 
A court acts in excess of jurisdiction
when it grants a motion to reconsider that is not based upon “new or different
facts, circumstances or law.”  (Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32
Cal.App.4th 1494, 1499.)  Motions for reconsideration are restricted to
circumstances where a party offers the Court some fact or circumstance not
previously considered, and some valid reason for not offering it earlier. (Id.) 
 
Moreover, there is a strict requirement of
diligence, which means the moving party must present a satisfactory explanation
for failing to provide the evidence or different facts
earlier. (Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 674, 690.) The burden under Section
1008 is comparable to that of a party seeking a new trial on the ground of
newly discovered evidence: the information must be such that the moving party
could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered or produced it at
trial.  (New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212-213.)   
 
             Respondent argues that the October 16, 2024 Order
denying his motion to set aside judgment should be reconsidered because there are
facts that shed new light on matters previously presented to the Court. Upon
review, Respondent has not presented new or different facts within the meaning
of CCP section 1008.  (New York Times,
supra, 135 Cal.App.4th at 213.) Respondent resubmits the same exhibits
which were filed in support of the original motion to set aside judgment. (Mot.
p. 5:1-3.) In addition, Respondent states that the “evidence Respondent now relies
on was uncovered only through extensive efforts in 2023 and 2024.” (Reply, p. 7:12.)
Accordingly, to the extent any of this evidence was not previously presented to
the Court, this evidence was available to Respondent when he filed the original
motion to set aside judgment on September 6, 2024. A motion for reconsideration
is limited to situations where a party presents the Court with new facts or
circumstances that were not previously considered, along with a valid
justification for failing to present them earlier. (Gilberd, supra,
32 Cal.App.4th at 1499.) 
 
            The Court declines Petitioner’s
requests to hold Respondent in contempt or issue sanctions at this time. 
 
            Respondent’s Motion for
Reconsideration is DENIED. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
