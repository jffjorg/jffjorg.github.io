MOVING PARTY:  Defendant La Canada Unified School District
(“Defendant”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
Nyel Bangash (“Plaintiff”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises from allegations
of harassment, bullying, and hazing that occurred while Plaintiff was a student
at La Canada High School. Plaintiff filed the operative complaint (“Complaint”)
on February 7, 2024 alleging causes of action for: (1) intentional infliction
of emotional distress (“IIED”); (2) negligent infliction of emotional distress
(“NIED”); (3) negligence; and (4) negligent supervision. 
 
            On December 2, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant demurrer (“Demurrer”) and motion to strike (“Motion”). On January
6, 2025, Plaintiff filed a combined opposition (“Opposition”) to the Demurrer
and Motion and on January 10, 2025, Defendant filed a reply (“Reply”).        
 
MEET AND CONFER 
             The parties have satisfied the meet and confer
requirement. 
 
DEMURRER
A demurrer for
sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”)
§ 430.10, subd. (e).) 
 
To sufficiently
allege a cause of action, a complaint must allege all the ultimate facts—that
is, the facts needed to establish each element of the cause of action pleaded.
(Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983)
35 Cal.3d 197, 212, superseded by statute as stated in Branick v. Downey
Savings & Loan Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) “[E]ach evidentiary
fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be
alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53
Cal.4th 861, 872.) 
 
In testing the
sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all
material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) Courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other grounds, Jones v. Lodge at
Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) A demurrer,
however, “does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or
law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.)  
 
A demurrer for
uncertainty lies where the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible.
(CCP, § 430.10, subd. (f).)
 
“A demurrer for
uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects
uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th
612, 616, disapproved on other grounds in Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title
Guar. Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 46 [holding claims for unfair business
practices need not be pled specifically, impliedly disapproving Khoury].)
As a result, a special demurrer for uncertainty is not intended to reach
failure to incorporate sufficient facts in the pleading but is directed only at
uncertainty existing in the allegations already made. (People v. Taliaferro
(1957) 149 Cal.App.2d 822, 825, disapproved on other grounds in Jefferson v.
J.E. French Co. (1960) 54 Cal.2d 717, 719-720 [statute of limitations
question].) 
 
Where a
complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action and to apprise a defendant
of issues he is to meet, it is not properly subject to a special demurrer for
uncertainty. (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643 [“A
special demurrer [for uncertainty] should be overruled where the allegations of
the complaint are sufficiently clear to apprise the defendant of the issues
which he is to meet”].) 
 
Timeliness
            Prior
to filing a suit against a public entity, a plaintiff must comply with the
Government Tort Claims Act, which states, in part: “no suit for money or
damages may be brought against a public entity on a cause of action for which a
claim is required to be presented . . . until a written claim therefor has been
presented to the public entity and has been acted upon by the board, or has
been deemed to have been rejected by the board . . .”¿ (Gov. Code, §
945.4)¿ 
 
A claim for
death or injury to person or personal property shall be presented not later
than six months after the accrual of the cause of action.¿ (Gov. Code, §
911.2,¿subd. (a).) When a claim required to be presented pursuant to Government
Code section 911.2, subdivision (a) is not presented within that time, a
written application may be made to the public entity for leave to present that
claim.¿ (Gov. Code, § 911.4,¿subd. (a).)¿ The application shall be presented to
the public entity within a reasonable time not to exceed one year after the
accrual of the cause of action and shall state the reason for the delay in
presenting the claim.¿ (Gov. Code, § 911.4,¿subd. (b).)¿
 
In the Demurrer,
Defendant asserts that Plaintiff’s claims are untimely because the claims
against Defendant accrued on August 11, 2021, when Plaintiff’s water bottle was
tampered with, or on August 12, 2021 when Plaintiff reported the incident to
Defendant. (Demurrer, p. 20:11-21; Compl., ¶¶ 36-44.) Plaintiff presented the
claim for damages to Defendant on August 15, 2023. (Compl., ¶ 14.) In the
Opposition, Plaintiff argues that the continuing violation doctrine applies
here and thus the claims accrue upon the last act in the alleged series of
misconduct. (Opp., pp. 12:15-13:14.) Plaintiff asserts that the “retaliation
continued most acutely from July 2022, when Geller was identified, through
March 2023 when Nyel quit the baseball team.” (Opp., p. 13:15-17.) 
 
To the extent a
claim is based on a “pattern of reasonably frequent and similar acts,” the
continuing violation doctrine makes the cause of action accrue on the date of
the last act. (Willis v. City of Carlsbad (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 1104,
1124.) In the Complaint, Plaintiff asserts that his claims for negligence and
related torts arise from incidents of bullying and retaliation within the
context of the baseball team, beginning in August 2021 and culminating in
Plaintiff’s decision to leave the team in March 2023. (Compl., ¶¶ 72-74.) As
Plaintiff has asserted that the last act occurred in March 2023, and he
presented his claim for damages in August 2023, the claim was timely presented.

 
Government Claims Act
            The
Government Claims Act states that “except as otherwise provided by statute, [a]
public entity is not liable for an injury, whether such injury arises out of an
act or omission of the public entity or a public employee or any other
person.”  (Govt. Code § 815.)  As the Senate Legislative Committee
explained in the comment to Government Code section 815, “the practical effect
of this section is to eliminate any common law governmental liability for
damages arising out of torts.”   
 
Defendant argues
that Plaintiff’s claims fail because Plaintiff has not pled any statutory
authority to bring the causes of action against Defendant, a public entity. The
Court agrees. The claims of IIED, NIED, negligence and negligent supervision
are common law tort claims. Accordingly, such claims are barred against
Defendant, a public school district, pursuant to the Government Claims Act. (See
e.g., McAllister v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th
1198, 1219 (holding that common law tort claims for wrongful discharge and NIED
barred by Government Code Section 815); Davidson ex rel. Sims v. Santa
Barbara High School Dist. (C.D. Cal. 1998) 48 F.Supp.2d 1225, 1232
(dismissing claims for negligence, NIED, and IIED against public entity for
being immune pursuant to Government Code § 815).) 
 
In the
Opposition, Plaintiff argues that Education Code section 234.1 subdivision (g)
imposes a statutory obligation on school districts to protect victims of
bullying. (Opp. pp. 7:23-11:11.)
 
 Education Code section 234.1 provides that “[t]he
department, pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 64001, shall monitor adherence
to the requirements of Chapter 5.3 (commencing with Section 4900) of Division 1
of Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations and this chapter as part of
its regular monitoring and review of local educational agencies, commonly known
as the Categorical Program Monitoring process. The department shall assess
whether local educational agencies have done all of the following: 
 
(g) Ensured that
complainants are protected from retaliation and that the identity of a
complainant alleging discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or bullying remains
confidential, as appropriate.” (Educ. Code § 234.1) 
 
Education Code section
234.1 imposes a duty on the “department” to “assess” whether local educational
agencies have done the enumerated acts under Education Code section 234.1
subdivisions (a) through (i).  “Department” as defined under Education
Code section 89 as the “State Department of Education.” 
 
Education Code section
234.1 does not impose a duty on the local education agencies, like Defendant,
to comply with (a) through (i).  As such, Defendant cannot be held liable
for “violating” Education Code section 234.1.  Section 234.1 does not
impose any duties on Defendant. 
 
Thus, because Plaintiff
has failed to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, the Demurrer
is SUSTAINED in its entirety. 
 
MOTION TO STRIKE
            The court may, upon a motion or at
any time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (a) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (b) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP § 436, subds.
(a), (b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a
pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are
surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)
 
            Because the Court has sustained the
Demurrer in its entirety, the Motion to Strike is moot. 
 
            Defendant’s Demurrer to the
Complaint is SUSTAINED, with 20 days leave to amend. The Motion to Strike is
MOOT.
 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 


 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
