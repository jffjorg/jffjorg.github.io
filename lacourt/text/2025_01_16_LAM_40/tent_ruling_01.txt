[TENTATIVE] ORDER
GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL DEFENDANT’S RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR
PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET ONE AND REQUEST FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL DEFENDANT’S FURTHER RESPONSE TO SPECIAL
INTERROGATORIES, THREE AND REQUEST FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS  
 
I.       BACKGROUND
      The complaint alleges claims for age discrimination in
violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act and for wrongful termination
in violation of public policy.  Plaintiff
files motions to compel written discovery responses and further responses from Defendant.
   
      A motion
to compel further responses to special interrogatories is proper where the
moving party believes the statement of compliance is incomplete, or a
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, evasive and/or an
objection is without merit or too general. (Code
Civ. Proc., sections 2030.300 subd. (a).)  A party may move to compel responses to
request for production of documents where a party fails to respond at all. In
that case, all objections are waived. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) 
      As
Defendant did not file an opposition, there is no dispute that the requested
discovery is relevant and discoverable.  Plaintiff
is entitled to recover costs and fees incurred to prepare these two motions as
follows:



Motion to compel further responses to special
  interrogatories, set three


2 hours to prepare the motion, .50 to
  appear @ $400 per hour


$1000.00




Motion to compel
  responses to request for production of documents


2 hours to prepare the
  motion x $400 per hour


$800.00




Filing fee


$60 x 2 motions


120.00




TOTAL SANCTIONS


 


$1,920.00



      Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motions are GRANTED. Defendant is ordered to
serve verified responses without objection to request for production of
documents and to serve further verified responses without objection to special
interrogatories, set three within 10 days. The court imposes total sanctions of
$1,920 for both motions against Defendant, Kotobuki-Ya, payable to Plaintiff
within 10 days.
