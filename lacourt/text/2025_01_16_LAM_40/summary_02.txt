And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the cross-complainant's motion to compel compliance with inspection demands and request for sanctions. The cross-complainant, Khowshro Benji, had requested that the cross-defendant, Aidee Jacqueline Tinoco Bucio, produce documents in response to requests 7 and 8 of Benji's document requests. Bucio failed to produce the documents in a timely manner, leading Benji to file the motion. The judge found that Bucio's belated compliance with the document request was insufficient and granted the motion. The judge also awarded sanctions of $1,600 plus $60 in costs incurred to Benji, payable within 10 days. The judge ordered the parties to meet and confer before filing any further motions.
