And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Charles P. Boylston on behalf of defendant Terrence Sperry. The motion was unopposed, and the judge found that the grounds for withdrawal were proper, including conflicts, a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, and a breach of an obligation to Counsel's office. However, the judge denied the motion without prejudice due to incomplete and defective documentation, including an incomplete declaration and proposed order, and a lack of proof that the electronic service address provided was the client's current electronic service address. The judge ordered Counsel to give notice of the ruling within five calendar days.
