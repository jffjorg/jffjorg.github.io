Tentative Ruling 
Defendant Cerritos Ford, Inc.’s Motion to
Compel Deposition is GRANTED. 
Prevailing party to give notice. 
 
Background 
Plaintiff Emigdio Andujo Nevarez filed suit against Ford
Motor Company (“Ford”) for alleged violations of the Song-Beverly Act and
against Cerritos Ford, Inc. for negligent repair. Since December 14, 2022, Ford
set Plaintiff’s deposition six times. A year later, Plaintiff still has not
appeared for his deposition. Despite Ford’s multiple attempts to obtain this
essential discovery, Plaintiff has failed to appear for his properly noticed
deposition.
On December 14, 2022, Ford sent Plaintiff a meet and confer
requesting dates for Plaintiff’s deposition. (Exhibit “A”; Declaration of Ravi
K. Lally {“Lally Decl.”} ¿ 2.) After hearing no response
from Plaintiff, Ford set Plaintiff’s deposition for January 11, 2023. (Exhibit
“B”; Lally Decl. ¿ 2.). On December 28, 2022,
Plaintiff objected to Ford’s Notice of Taking Plaintiff’s Deposition claiming
that the deposition was unilaterally set. (Lally Decl. ¿ 2.).
After receiving the objection, Ford contacted Plaintiff on December 28, 2022,
and requested alternative deposition dates. (Lally Decl. ¿ 2.).
No response was received from Plaintiff. (Lally Decl. ¿ 2.).
On January 11, 2023, Ford again followed up with Plaintiff requesting dates for
his deposition. (Exhibit “C”; Lally Decl. ¿ 2.).
On January 18, 2023, Plaintiff advised he would be
available to be deposed on February 23, 2023, March 2, 2023, or March 9, 2023.
(Lally Decl. ¿ 3.). Ford agreed to take Plaintiff’s
deposition on March 9, 2023. (Exhibit “D”; Lally Decl. ¿ 3.).
On February 28, 2023, Plaintiff advised that he would no longer be available to
be deposed on March 9, 2023, a date that he provided. (Exhibit “E”; Lally Decl.
¿ 3.).
No alternative deposition dates were provided. (Lally Decl. ¿ 3.).
On March 21, 2023, Ford served a Second Amended Notice of Taking Plaintiff’s
Deposition and set the deposition for May 16, 2023. (Exhibit “F”; Lally Decl. ¿ 4.). 
On May 15, 2023, Plaintiff served an untimely objection to
Ford’s Second Amended Notice of Taking Plaintiff’s Deposition, claiming it was
unilaterally set. (Lally Decl. ¿ 4.). Upon receipt of the
Objection, on May 15, 2023, Ford sent a meet and confer correspondence
requesting dates for Plaintiff’s deposition. (Exhibit “F”; Lally Decl. ¿ 4.).
On May 15, 2023, Plaintiff responded that he was available to be deposed on
June 27, 2023, July 6, 2023, and July 13, 2023. (Lally Decl. ¿ 5.).
At Plaintiff’s request, Plaintiff’s deposition was scheduled for June 27, 2023.
(Exhibit “H”; Lally Decl. ¿ 5.).
On June 20, 2023, Plaintiff advised that he would no longer
proceed with his deposition on June 27, 2023. (Lally Decl. ¿ 5.).
No explanation was provided regarding why Plaintiff was failing to appear for a
second time on a date that he provided. (Lally Decl. ¿ 5.).
No alternative deposition dates were provided. (Lally Decl. ¿ 5.).
On June 26, 2023, Ford served a Fourth Amended Notice of Taking Plaintiff’s
Deposition. (Exhibit “I”; Lally Decl. ¿ 6.).
The deposition was set for July 27, 2023. (Exhibit “I”.). Plaintiff failed to
appear for the fifth time. (Lally Decl. ¿ 6.). 
On August 24, 2023, Ford reserved a hearing date to compel
Plaintiff’s deposition. (Lally Decl. ¿ 7.).
The first available hearing date was February 6, 2024. (Lally Decl. ¿ 7).
Ford also continued with their efforts to take Plaintiff’s deposition. On
August 24, 2023, Ford served a Fifth Amended Notice of Taking Plaintiff’s
Deposition. (Exhibit “J”; Lally Decl. ¿ 7.).
The deposition was scheduled for September 26, 2023. (Exhibit “J”). On
September 19, 2023, Plaintiff served an Objection to the deposition notice.
On December 6, 2023, Ford again requested dates for
Plaintiff’s deposition. (Exhibit “K” Lally Decl. ¿ 8.).
No response was received. (Lally Decl. ¿ 8.).
On January 24, 2024, the date Plaintiff’s Opposition was
due, Plaintiff contacted Ford and indicated he would be available to be deposed
on March 14, 2024. Ford has noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for March 14, 2024.
Ford now requests that this Court compel Plaintiff to attend his deposition on
March 14, 2024.
On January 24, 2024, Plaintiff’s Counsel filed a
declaration indicating no opposition to the Court compelling Plaintiff’s
deposition.

Discussion 
On December 14, 2022, Ford sent Plaintiff a meet and confer
requesting dates for Plaintiff’s deposition. (Exhibit “A”; Lally Decl. ¿ 2.)
After hearing no response from Plaintiff, Ford set Plaintiff’s deposition for
January 11, 2023. (Exhibit “B”; Lally Decl. ¿ 2.).
The parties conferred and agreed to delay the initial deposition. On March 21,
2023, Ford served a Second Amended Notice of Taking Plaintiff’s Deposition and
set the deposition for May 16, 2023. (Exhibit “F”; Lally Decl. ¿ 4.).
This deposition was again delayed. 
Overall, there have been five amended notices of taking
Plaintiff’s deposition, with the most recent being on or around January 24,
2024. Plaintiff contacted Ford and indicated he would be available to be
deposed on March 14, 2024. Ford has noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for March
14, 2024. Ford now requests that this Court compel Plaintiff to attend his
deposition on March 14, 2024.
Given that Plaintiff has not attended any of the prior
properly noticed depositions, the Court finds good cause to grant the motion to
compel.  
Accordingly, the Court compels deposition of Plaintiff
within 45 days of this order.
