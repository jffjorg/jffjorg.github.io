Summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers filed by Ford Motor Company and Santa Margarita Ford to the second and third causes of action in the complaint filed by Michael Thalken and Brandi Thalken. The judge has overruled Ford Motor Company's demurrer to the second cause of action for fraudulent concealment, finding that the complaint adequately alleges the necessary elements of a fraud cause of action. However, the judge has sustained Santa Margarita Ford's demurrer to the third cause of action for negligent repair, finding that the complaint does not adequately allege an independent duty giving rise to tort liability and that the claim is barred by the economic loss rule. The judge has given the defendants 30 days to amend their demurrer, and has ordered them to give notice of the ruling.
