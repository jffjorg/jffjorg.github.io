Tentative Ruling 
Defendant Omar Deniz’s Motion
to Quash Service of Summons is DENIED. 
Plaintiff to give
notice. 
 
Background
This is a commercial unlawful
detainer action by Plaintiff Abner Hinojos, the owner of the property, against
Defendant Omar Deniz, the commercial tenant. 

Defendant Omar Deniz files the
instant motion to quash service of summons. 
Legal
Standard 
“A defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to
plead or within any further time that the court may for good cause allow, may
serve and file a notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes: To
quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court
over him or her.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a)(1), emphasis
added.)  A defendant has 30 days after the service of the summons to file
a responsive pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 412.20, subd. (a)(3).)  
 
“When a defendant challenges the court’s personal
jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of process ‘the burden is on the
plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the
facts requisite to an effective service.’” (Summers v. McClanahan¿(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413.) A
proof of service containing a declaration from a registered process server
invokes a presumption of valid service.  (See¿American Express
Centurion Bank v. Zara¿(2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390; see also Evid. Code
§ 647.) This presumption is rebuttable. (See¿id.) The party seeking to
defeat service of process must present sufficient evidence to show that the
service did not take place as stated. (See Palm Property Investments, LLC v.
Yadegar¿(2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 1419, 1428; cf.¿People v. Chavez¿(1991)
231 Cal.App.3d 1471, 1483 [“If some fact be presumed, the opponent of that fact
bears the burden of producing or going forward with evidence sufficient to
overcome or rebut the presumed fact.”].)  
 
Merely denying service took place without more is insufficient to
overcome the presumption.  (See¿Yadegar, supra, 194 Cal.App.4th at
1428.) 
 
Discussion

Defendant seeks to quash
service on the basis that Plaintiff did not properly serve the Summons and
Complaint. (Mot., p. 3.) Defendant provides the declaration of Omar Deniz,
leaser of the property, stating that on November 6 (Defendant does not provided
a year) his brother was left a summons and complaint at 1:45 p.m. (Deniz Decl.,
¶ 3.) He goes on to say that no other attempts at service have been attempted
and that he has not evaded service. (Deniz Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.)
Plaintiff contends Defendant was
properly served with the Summons and Complaint by substituted service pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure Section 415.20. (See Proof of Service of Summons
filed November 29, 2023.) 
Personal
service may be accomplished by personally delivering a copy of the summons and
complaint to the person to be served.  (Code of Civ. Proc., §
415.10.)  If a copy of the summons and complaint cannot with reasonable
diligence be personally delivered to the person being served, substitute
service may be effected by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the
person’s “dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or
usual mailing address . . . in the presence of . . . a person apparently in
charge . . . and by thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and complaint by
first-class mail . . . to the person to be served at the place where a copy of
the summons and complaint were left.”  (Code of Civ. Proc., § 415.20,
subd. (b).)   
 
Here, the Proof of Service
indicates Greg Chayra, a registered process server, made two unsuccessful
attempts to serve Defendant at his place of business, JS Auto Body, in
Huntington Park.  During the third
attempt at 2 p.m. on November 6, 2023, Mr. Chayra left the documents with the
person in charge, explaining the nature of the documents to him.  On November 17, 2023, Mr. Chayra mailed a
copy of the summons and complaint to the person to be served at the place where
the summons and complaint were left.    
Filing a proof of service by a registered process server
creates a rebuttable presumption that service was proper.  (American
Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390; Evid. Code,
§ 647 [“The return of a process server registered pursuant to . . . the
Business and Professions Code upon process or notice establishes a presumption,
affecting the burden of producing evidence, of the facts stated in the
return”].)  However, the presumption only arises if the proof of service
complies with the statutory requirements regarding such proofs.  (Dill,
supra, 24 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1441-1442.)  Proof of service of
summons may be impeached by evidence that contradicts it.  (City of Los
Angeles v. Morgan (1951) 105 Cal.App.2d 726, 731.)
 
The Court finds service was
proper.  The statutes governing substitute service are liberally construed
to effectuate service and uphold jurisdiction if actual notice has been
received by defendant.  (Hearn v. Howard (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th
1193, 1201.) Here, notice was provided to the person in charge of the office
and by mailing the documents to Defendant by first class mail on November 17,
2023. 
 
Accordingly, the Motion to Quash Service of Summons
is DENIED.
