And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Defendant's motion to quash service of summons in a commercial unlawful detainer action filed by the Plaintiff, Abner Hinojos, against the Defendant, Omar Deniz. The Defendant seeks to quash service on the grounds that the Plaintiff did not properly serve the Summons and Complaint. However, the Judge finds that the service was proper, as the registered process server made multiple attempts to serve the Defendant at his place of business, JS Auto Body, and ultimately left the documents with the person in charge. The Judge notes that the Proof of Service creates a rebuttable presumption that service was proper, and the Defendant has failed to present sufficient evidence to overcome this presumption. Therefore, the motion to quash service of summons is denied.
