Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiff Angelo Silva’s Motion
for Interlocutory Judgment of Partition and Appointment of Referee is GRANTED. 

Moving party to give notice. 
 
Background
This action seeks a partition by sale of the single-family
residence located at: 13024 Lefloss Ave, Norwalk, CA 90650, APN: 8050-013-004
(the "Property"). This motion seeks to resolve this co-ownership
dispute by appointing experienced partition referee Matthew L. Taylor, Esq. to
market and sell the Property.
Legal Standard 
C.C.P. § 872.720(a) provides that if the Court finds that the
plaintiff is entitled to partition, it shall make an interlocutory judgment
that determines the interests of the parties in the property and orders the
partition and the manner of partition. (C.C.P., § 872.720(a).)¿¿¿ 
 
“A partition action may be commenced and maintained by any of the
following persons: (1) A co-owner of personal property.¿ (2) An owner of an
estate of inheritance, an estate for life, or an estate for years in real
property where such property or estate therein is owned by several persons
concurrently or in successive estates.” (C.C.P. § 872.210, (a).) “The court
shall order that the property be divided among the parties in accordance with
their interests in the property as determined in the interlocutory judgment.”
(C.C.P. § 872.810.)¿¿¿ 
 
Discussion 
Plaintiff’s
motion asks the Court to enter interlocutory judgment of partition and
appointment of referee Matthew L. Taylor with regard to the sale of a
single-family residence located at:13024 Lefloss Ave, Norwalk, CA
90650, APN: 8050-013-004. Plaintiff contends that the parties hold title to the
property in tenants in common. (Complaint ¶ 4.) Plaintiff
attaches a copy of the grant deed to the complaint reflecting the tenancy in
common. (Complaint Exh. 2.)
C.C.P.
§ 872.710(a) states: “At the trial, the court shall determine whether the
plaintiff has the right to partition.”¿ (C.C.P. § 872.710(a).)¿ “If the court
finds that the plaintiff is entitled to partition, it shall make an
interlocutory judgment that determines the interests of the parties in the
property and orders the partition of the property and, unless it is to be later
determined, the manner of partition.”¿ (C.C.P. § 872.720(a).)¿ Viewed together,
sections 872.710(a) and 872.720(a) clearly indicate that a court’s
determination regarding an interlocutory judgment is to be made at trial, or by
means of a properly filed dispositive motion as allowed under the Code of Civil
Procedure. (See also Bacon v. Wahrhaftig¿(1950) 97 Cal.App.2d 599,
finding no partition can be had until the interests of all the parties have
been ascertained and settled by a trial.) ¿ 
On July 26,
2023, the Court signed a stipulation between parties to partition by sale of
real property and appointment of referee. 
Only one
Defendant, Michael Silva, is opposed to the sale.  Defendant Silva has been found to be in
default on June 26, 2023.  No opposition
to Plaintiff’s Motion has been received as of February 2, 2024.  
Pursuant to
the Court’s Order dated July 26, 2023 approving the stipulation of the joining
Defendants, Plaintiff’s Motion for
Interlocutory Judgment of Partition and Appointment of Referee is GRANTED.
