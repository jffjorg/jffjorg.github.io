#2 
Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Further Responses
to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents (Set One) is GRANTED in
part and DENIED in part as set forth below. 

 
Moving party to give notice. 
 
Background 
This is a lemon law case. Plaintiffs YESENIA GARCIA and
ARMANDO GARCIA (“Plaintiff”) was the purchaser of a 2020 Honda Pilot (the
“Subject Vehicle”), which was distributed and warranted by Defendant AMERICAN
HONDA NORTH AMERICA, INC. (“Defendant”).
Legal Standard 
A
party may make a demand for production of documents
and propound interrogatories without leave of court at any time 10 days after
the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the party to whom the demand
is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (b);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for production of documents
is not limited by number, but the request must comply with the formatting
requirements in Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.030.
 
The party whom the request is propounded upon is required to
respond within 30 days after service of a demand, but the parties are allowed
to informally agree to an extension and confirm any such agreement in writing.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.060, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.060, subd.
(a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.070, subd. (a) - (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.070,
subd. (a) - (b).) 
 
If a party fails to timely respond to a request for production or
interrogatories, the party to whom the request is directed waives any right to
exercise the option to produce writings under Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and
waives any objection, including one based on privilege or on the protection for
work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).)  
 
Discussion 
Request No. 20 
·       
The operative dealership agreement, if any, on
the date of sale of the SUBJECT VEHICLE between YOU and the dealership that
sold the SUBJECT VEHICLE to Plaintiffs.
Plaintiff argues that the operative dealership agreement is
relevant to prove the agency relationship between the manufacturer and
Dealership and the requisite duty on behalf of the manufacturer to disclose the
information of the defect.  Defendant
argues that the agreement contains confidential, commercially sensitive, or
proprietary information.  The Court
agrees with Defendant that Plaintiff has less intrusive means to establish an
agency relationship than to compel disclosure of the entire dealership agreement.  Defendant is ORDERED to provide Plaintiff
with a sample and/or redacted agreement which contains all relevant terms
without disclosing confidential financial information.  
Accordingly, the motion to compel further response to No.
20 is GRANTED in part. 
Request 27-28 
·       
All Technical Service Bulletins which have been
issued for the same year, make, and model as the SUBJECT VEHICLE.
·       
All DOCUMENTS which evidence or discuss YOUR
decision to issue the Technical Service Bulletins for the same year, make, and
model as the SUBJECT VEHICLE.
These
requests are overbroad because they seek documents unrelated to the Subject
Vehicle. Therefore, these requests will be limited to Technical Service
Bulletins relating to the defects alleged to be present within the Subject
Vehicle.  
Accordingly, the
motion to compel further responses to Nos. 27-28 is GRANTED in part.  
Request 55
·       
All DOCUMENTS produced by YOU in discovery in
the matter of Kathleen Cadena, et al., v. American Honda Motor Company, Inc.,
et al, United States District Court, Central District of California Case No.
2:18-cv-04007-MWF-PJW.
The Court finds this request to be overbroad.  The Court determines that production of the
requested documents will require Defendant to produce confidential information
and will not reasonably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.   
Accordingly, the motion to compel further response to No. 55
is DENIED. 
Request 56-60, 66, 71-73
·       
No. 56: The organizational structure for the
engineers that developed the software for the HONDA SENSING system from 2014 to
present. “HONDA SENSING” refers to the Collision Mitigation Braking System
(CMBS), Road Departure Mitigation System (RDM), Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC),
Traffic Sign Recognition System, Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS), and Millimeter-Wave
Radar sensor utilized on Honda vehicles.
·       
No. 57: The organizational structure for the
engineers that tested the software for the HONDA SENSING system from 2014 to
present.
·       
No. 58: The organizational structure for the
engineers that released the software for the HONDA SENSING system from 2014 to
present.
·       
No. 59: The software requirements for the HONDA
SENSING system from 2014 to present.
·       
No. 60: The software specifications for the
HONDA SENSING system from 2014 to present.
·       
No. 66: The hardware requirements for the HONDA
SENSING system from 2014 to present.
·       
No. 71: The basic software design reviews and
reports for HONDA SENSING in Honda vehicles from 2014 to present.
·       
No. 72: The release notes for the software
utilized in HONDA SENSING in Honda vehicles from 2014 to present.
·       
No. 73: The issue tracking sheet for the
software utilized in HONDA SENSING in Honda vehicles from 2014 to present.
The
Court determines that these requests are not reasonably calculated to lead to
admissible evidence because the information relates to the cause of the
purported defects, which is something Plaintiffs are not required to
prove.  To the extent such information is
relevant to the lawsuit, the probative value is too remote, and the requests
are unduly burdensome.  Moreover, it
appears that Nos. 59, 60, 66 and 71-73 may request confidential and
proprietary, or trade secret information. 

Accordingly, the
motion to compel further responses to Nos. 56-60, 66, and 71-73 is
DENIED.
