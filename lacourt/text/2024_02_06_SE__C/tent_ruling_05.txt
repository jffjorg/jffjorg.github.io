Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiff Constance Brady’s Motion to Compel
Production of Defendant Drylie’s Personnel Records is GRANTED in part and
DENIED in part as set forth below.   
Moving party to give notice. 
 
Background 
Plaintiff Constance Brady (“Plaintiff”) joined the City of
Whittier’s Law Enforcement Explorers Post program when she was 15 years
old.  Plaintiff alleges she was subjected
to ongoing grooming and multiple sexual assaults by Defendant Charles “Chuck”
Drylie, a Whittier police officer designated as a Supervising Law Enforcement
Police Explorers Advisor.  
On February 4, 2022, Plaintiff sued Defendants Drylie and
the City of Whittier for Negligence, Negligent Training and Supervision, Sexual
Battery, Sexual Harassment, and Gender Violence.  On August 25, 2022, Plaintiff served her
first Request for Production (“RFP”) upon the City. (Dunn Decl. at ¶ 2.) The
City Responded to Plaintiff’s RFP on December 5, 2022. (Id. at ¶ 4.) As to
certain requests, the City acknowledged it had responsive documents in its
possession; however, the City was withholding them because the documents were
contained in Defendant Drylie’s personnel file. (Pitchess v. Superior Ct.
(1979) 11 Cal. 3d 531.)  
Plaintiff now moves this Court to compel the City to
produce Defendant Drylie’s personnel records pursuant to Pitchess and
its progeny.
Legal Standard 
A
motion to discover a law enforcement officer’s personnel file or other police
agency record that contains relevant information is called a¿Pitchess¿motion.¿
(Pitchess v. Superior Court¿(1974) 11 Cal.3d 531, 536-540.)¿ The¿Pitchess¿motion
has been partly codified in Evidence Code, section 1043, which makes law
enforcement personnel records privileged and subject to disclosure only by
noticed motion.¿ (Evid. Code, § 1043; Pen. Code, § 832.7(a).)¿ The statutory
scheme governing¿Pitchess¿motions is set forth in Evidence Code sections
1043-1047 and Penal Code sections 832.5, 832.7, 832.8.¿ (People v.¿Mooc¿(2001)
26 Cal.4th 1216, 1226.)¿ These statutes provide the exclusive means of
discovery of such records in both criminal and civil proceedings.¿ (County
of Los Angeles v.¿Sup. Ct.¿(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1605, 1609-1610.)¿¿ 
 
“Under
the statutory scheme, a party seeking discovery of a peace officer’s personnel
records must follow a two-step process.¿ First, the party must file a written
motion describing the type of records sought, supported by affidavits showing
good cause for the discovery…,¿setting forth the materiality thereof to the
subject matter involved in the pending litigation and stating upon reasonable
belief that the governmental agency identified has the records¿or information
from the records.¿¿This initial burden is¿a ‘relatively relaxed
standard.’¿¿Information is material if it¿will facilitate the ascertainment¿of
the facts and a fair trial.¿ A¿declaration by counsel on information and belief
is sufficient to state facts to satisfy the ‘materiality’ component of that
section.”¿¿(Haggerty v.¿Sup. Ct.¿(2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1079,
1085-1086¿(Haggerty), internal citations and quotations omitted.)¿¿The
motion must provide a “specific factual scenario” that establishes the
materiality of the discovery sought.¿ (City of Santa Cruz v. Municipal Court¿(1989)
49 Cal.3d 74, 85-86¿(Santa Cruz).)¿ The documents must be requested
“with adequate specificity” to preclude the possibility that the moving party
is engaged in a “fishing expedition.”¿ (People v.¿Memro¿(1985) 38 Cal.3d
658, 678 (Memro), overruled on unrelated grounds in¿People v. Gaines¿(2009)
46 Cal.4th 172, 181, n. 2.)¿ Information consisting of complaints concerning
conduct occurring¿more than five years before the event or transaction that is
the subject of the litigation in aid of which discovery is sought must be
excluded from disclosure.¿ (Evid. Code, § 1045,¿subd. (b).)¿¿¿ 
 
“Second,
if¿the trial court concludes¿[a party]¿has fulfilled these prerequisites and
made a showing of good cause, the custodian of records should bring to court
all documents ‘potentially relevant’ to the [requesting party’s]¿motion….¿¿The
trial court ‘shall examine the information in¿chambers,¿out of the presence and
hearing of all persons except the person authorized to possess the records¿and
such other persons¿the custodian of records is willing to have
present….¿¿Subject to statutory exceptions and limitations¿...¿the trial court
should then disclose to the defendant such information that is relevant to the
subject matter involved in the pending litigation.” (Haggerty,¿supra,
117 Cal.App.4th at p. 1086, internal quotation marks and citations omitted).¿¿ 
 
Discussion 
Section 1043 requires a showing of “good cause”
for discovery in two general categories: “(1) the ‘materiality’¿of the
information or records sought to the ‘subject matter involved in the pending
litigation,’¿and (2) a¿‘reasonable belief’¿that the governmental agency has the
‘type’¿of information or records sought to be disclosed.”¿ (Santa Cruz,¿supra,¿49
Cal.3d¿at p.¿84, citing Evid. code, § 1043,¿subd. (b).)¿¿ 
 
Requests
Nos. 8, 19, 41, 48, and 62
 
The following discovery requests relate to
complaints of alleged sexual misconduct by Defendant Drylie.  
 
NO. 8: Any and all DOCUMENTS related to any
contemplated or actual discipline of DRYLIE.
NO. 19: Any and all COMMUNICATIONS between YOU
and any other PERSON regarding any complaints regarding DRYLIE’s SEXUAL
MISCONDUCT.
NO. 41.: Any and all COMMUNICATIONS by or
amongst the Administrative Division of the POLICE DEPARTMENT regarding
allegations of DRYLIE’s SEXUAL MISCONDUCT.
NO. 48.: Any and all of YOUR internal
COMMUNICATIONS regarding DRYLIE’s SEXUAL MISCONDUCT.
NO. 62.: If YOU contend that YOU did not have
actual or constructive notice of DRYLIE’s SEXUAL MISCONDUCT with PLAINTIFF,
please produce all DOCUMENTS that support YOUR contention.
 
As to Nos.
8, 19, 41, and 48, the Court finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause
for an in-camera review of Defendant Drylie’s personnel records for disclosure
of complaints and disciplinary records relating to alleged sexual
misconduct.  The Court schedules an
in-camera hearing on March 1, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C to review
all responsive complaints contained with Defendant Drylie’s personnel
records.  
 
As to the
remaining communications sought in these requests, the City represents that it is
in possession of responsive emails (after 1999) among members of the WPD
Administrative Division as well as emails between members of the WPD
Administrative Division and the LA County Sheriff’s Department regarding the
WPD’s referral of an investigation of Plaintiff’s sexual abuse allegations
against Defendant Drylie to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.  The Court orders production of these
documents to Plaintiff within 30 days.  
 
As to No.
62, the Court determines that this request is vague and overbroad.

The following requests relate to
Defendant Drylie’s employment with the Whittier Police Department and his
association with the Explorers:
NO. 1.: Any and all COMMUNICATIONS
between YOU and DRYLIE related to DRYLIE’s employment with YOU. 
NO. 2.: Any and all COMMUNICATIONS between YOU
and any other PERSON, other than YOUR attorney of record, relating to DRYLIE’s
employment with YOU. 
NO. 3.: Any and all DOCUMENTS related to
DRYLIE’s affiliation with the EXPLORERS, including, but not limited to, any
correspondence, job applications, flyers, forms, advertisements, list of
references, notes of interviews, calendars of interviews, offer letters,
written agreements, and contracts. 
NO. 4.: Any and ALL DOCUMENTS related to

notes or evaluations, prior to DRYLIE’s employment with YOU. 
NO. 6.: Any and all DOCUMENTS constituting
DRYLIE’s employment file with YOU. 
NO. 7.: Any and all DOCUMENTS related to

the EXPLORERS.
NO. 51.: Any and all DOCUMENTS
regarding any training YOU provided to DRYLIE.
As to Nos. 1-7 and 14-15, the Court determines
that these requests are overbroad and unduly burdensome.  Plaintiff cites to no authority, and the
Court is aware of none, permitting disclosure of all documents contained within
a police officers personnel file.  
 
As to No. 9 and 51, the Court determines that
the requests for job descriptions and training materials are within the proper
scope of discovery.  Production of these
documents is compelled even though they may not be contained within Defendant
Drylie’s personnel file.  The Court
orders production of these documents within 30 days.  
 
Request No. 27
NO. 27: Any and all COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and PLAINTIFF or
any member of PLAINTIFF’s family at any time. 
As to No. 27, the Court determines that these
requests are within the proper scope of discovery.  Production of these documents is compelled
even though they may not be contained within Defendant Drylie’s personnel file.  The Court orders production of these
documents within 30 days.  
Requests Nos. 60 and 64
These requests relate to other discovery requests propounded upon
the City.  
NO. 60.: Any and all DOCUMENTS
identified in response to the concurrently propounded Special Interrogatories,
Set One to Defendant CITY.
NO. 64.: All DOCUMENTS identified
in response to PLAINTIFF’s concurrently propounded Form Interrogatories to
CITY.
These requests are properly the
subject of a separately noticed motion.  
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to
Compel Production of Defendant Drylie’s Personnel Records is GRANTED in part
and DENIED in part as set forth above.
