KINGSBURY, opposes the motion, arguing that good cause exists to continue the motion to allow for outstanding depositions, which are vital to support Plaintiff's arguments. The Court finds that the information to be derived from the outstanding depositions is important to Plaintiff's Opposition and, in the interests of justice, has decided to continue the motion. The Plaintiff is allowed to take the outstanding depositions, and a Supplemental Opposition and Reply to the Supplemental Opposition may be filed and served by the new hearing date.
