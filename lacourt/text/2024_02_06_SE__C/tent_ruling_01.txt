Defendant RALPHS GROCERY COMPANY’s Motion for Summary
Judgment, or alternatively, Summary Adjudication is CONTINUED to Tuesday,
April 9, 2024 at 10:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C. 
 
Opposing Party to give notice. 
 
This action for premises liability was filed by Plaintiff
ROSA M. KINGSBURY (“Plaintiff”) on April 27, 2021. On November 29, 2022, the
operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) was filed. 
 
In Opposition, Plaintiff argues that good cause exists to
continue the subject Motion to allow Plaintiff to take outstanding depositions,
which are vital to support Plaintiff’s arguments. (Fisher Decl., ¶¶3-7.) 
 
No Reply filed as of February 2, 2024. Due by February 1,
2024. (CCP §437c(b)(4).) 
 
“If it appears from the affidavits submitted in opposition
to a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication, or both, that facts
essential to justify opposition may exist but cannot, for reasons stated, be
presented, the court shall deny the motion, order a continuance to permit
affidavits to be obtained or discovery to be had, or make any other order as
may be just. The application to continue the motion to obtain necessary
discovery may also be made by ex parte motion at any time on or before the date
the opposition response to the motion is due.” (CCP §437c(h).) 
 
Defendant’s Motion is potentially dispositive of this entire action. The
Court finds that the information to be derived from the outstanding depositions
are important to Plaintiff’s Opposition. In the interests of justice, and in
favor of adjudicating this matter on the merits, the Motion is CONTINUED as
indicated above. 
 
A Supplemental Opposition and Reply to the Supplemental Opposition may
be filed and served per Code in accordance with the new hearing date.
