And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the parties' motions and responses regarding the production of Defendant Drylie's personnel records. The court finds that Plaintiff Brady has demonstrated good cause for an in-camera review of the records to disclose complaints and disciplinary records relating to alleged sexual misconduct. The court will schedule an in-camera hearing on March 1, 2024, to review the responsive complaints contained within Defendant Drylie's personnel records.

The court orders the production of certain documents, including emails between members of the WPD Administrative Division and the LA County Sheriff's Department regarding the WPD's referral of an investigation of Plaintiff Brady's sexual abuse allegations against Defendant Drylie to the LA County Sheriff's Department. The court also orders the production of job descriptions and training materials related to Defendant Drylie's employment with the Whittier Police Department.

The court denies certain requests for production, finding them to be overbroad and unduly burdensome, including requests for all documents contained within Defendant Drylie's personnel file. The court grants Plaintiff Brady's motion to compel production of Defendant Drylie's personnel records in part and denies it in part as set forth above.
