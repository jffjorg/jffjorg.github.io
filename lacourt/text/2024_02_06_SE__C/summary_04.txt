And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge [Name] in the case of Jose Luis Velasco vs. General Motors, LLC (Case No. 22NWCV01368). The case involves a dispute over a 2017 Chevrolet Colorado purchased by Velasco, which allegedly had a defective transmission. General Motors, LLC demurred to the Fifth Cause of Action for Fraud and moved to strike the claim for punitive damages. The court ruled that the demurrer was OVERRULED and the motion to strike was DENIED.

The court also granted Velasco's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents, but limited the scope of the requests to documents related to 2017 Chevrolet Colorado vehicles sold in California. The court ordered General Motors, LLC to provide further responses to certain requests.

The court found that General Motors, LLC acted with substantial justification in opposing the motion to compel, and therefore did not impose sanctions on the defendant.
