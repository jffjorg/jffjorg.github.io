And here is the summary in English text:

The Court's tentative ruling grants in part and denies in part the Plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses to their requests for production of documents. The Plaintiffs, Yesenia and Armando Garcia, are seeking information related to a lemon law case involving a 2020 Honda Pilot. The Court agrees with the Defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., that some requests are overbroad and requires confidentiality and proprietary information to be protected.

The Court orders the Defendant to provide a sample and/or redacted dealership agreement, which contains relevant terms without disclosing confidential financial information. The Court also limits Requests 27-28 to Technical Service Bulletins relating to the defects alleged to be present in the Subject Vehicle.

However, the Court denies the motion to compel further responses to Requests 56-60, 66, and 71-73, as they are not reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence and may request confidential and proprietary information. The Court finds that the requests are too broad and would require the production of confidential information, which would not reasonably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
