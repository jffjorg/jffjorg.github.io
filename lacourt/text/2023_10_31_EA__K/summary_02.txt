The motion is based on new facts discovered through plaintiff's and Sergio Valdez's depositions, which support the assertion of additional affirmative defenses. The court has wide discretion in allowing amendments to pleadings, and the proposed amendments relate to the same general set of facts. The motion is granted, despite technical non-compliance with certain rules, as the proposed amendments are necessary and proper.
