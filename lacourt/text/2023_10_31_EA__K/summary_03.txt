And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff, ODK Capital, LLC, is seeking to collect on a loan that was made to Aei Final Solutions, LLC and guaranteed by Allan Inocencio. The loan was originally made by Celtic Bank, which assigned its rights to the plaintiff. Aei and Inocencio have failed to make payments on the loan, and the plaintiff has filed a complaint alleging breach of contract. The judge notes that the plaintiff's custodian of records, Cathleen Pugh, has attested that the assignment of the claim from Celtic Bank to the plaintiff is valid, but has failed to provide a copy of the assignment to the court. The judge has set a case management conference for October 31, 2023, and is requiring the plaintiff to provide the assignment before the hearing.
