And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where the plaintiff is seeking penalty damages under Civil Code § 8800. However, the judge notes that the plaintiff has omitted the fact that the court previously awarded interest accruing at 10% in a June 5, 2023 minute. The judge also references Civil Code § 8118, which requires proof of notice to be made by a proof of notice declaration. The declaration must include specific information about the notice, including the date, place, and manner of notice, as well as the name and address of the person to whom notice was given. The judge is requiring the plaintiff to provide this proof of notice in order to support their claim for penalty damages.
