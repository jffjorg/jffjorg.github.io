Background   
Plaintiff ODK Capital, LLC (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
On February 24, 2022, Aei Final
Solutions, LLC (“Aei”) and Celtic Bank (“Celtic”) entered into a Business Loan
and Security Agreement with accompanying supplement (“BLSA”) wherein Celtic
agreed to loan monies to Aei in exchange for repayment. Allan Inocencio
(“Inocencio”) contemporaneously executed a personal guaranty. Celtic
subsequently assigned its rights, title and interest under the BLSA to
Plaintiff. Aei and Inocencio have failed to make payments due.
On June 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting a
cause of action against Aei, Inocencio and Does 1-10 for:
1.     
Breach of Contract
On October 12, 2023, Aei’s and Inocencio’s defaults were
entered.

Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
Plaintiff’s Custodian of Records Cathleen Pugh (“Pugh”)
attests that “Plaintiff’s assignor CELTIC BANK assigned the claim to Plaintiff
who is now the lawful owner of the claim.” Pugh, however, has failed to provide
the court with a copy of the assignment.
