Background   
Plaintiff Weiqing Xu (“Xu”) alleges as follows:
On September 2, 2015, Honghua Shang (erroneously
sued as Hongshua Shang) (“Shang”) and EChain, Inc. dba E-Chain Realty (“Echain”)
(collectively, “Defendants”) induced Xu to sign two separate Power of Attorney
documents. Xu also loaned Defendants $75,000.00 (i.e., $30,000.00 on or around
June 1, 2015 and $45,000.00 on or around September 6, 2015). Although
Defendants issued Xu a check for $5,000.00 on or around October 1, 2017, no
further payments have been made.
On December 14, 2020, Xu filed a complaint, asserting causes
of action against Defendants and Does 1-10 for:
1.                 
Breach of Contract
2.                 
Open Book Account
3.                 
Fraud—Intentional Misrepresentation
4.                 
Fraud—Promise without Intent to Perform
5.                 
Conversion 
On February 18, 2021, Shang filed a cross-complaint,
asserting a cause of action against Xu and Roes 1-50 for:
1.                 
Breach of Contract
On June 23, 2023, Echain’s default was entered.
The Final Status Conference is set for November 27, 2023.
Trial is set for December 12, 2023.
Discussion
Xu moves the court for orders compelling Shang to provide further
responses, without objection, to Xu’s Requests for Admissions, Form
Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories, Sets No. Two. Xu also moves the
court for an order compelling Shang to provide responses, without objection, to
Xu’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set No. Two. Xu seeks sanctions in
connection with each motion.
The hearing on each
of the above motions is continued to November 20, 2023 at 9:30 a.m., due to the notice deficiency identified in footnote one. Counsel for Xu
is to provide notice of the continued hearing date forthwith.
