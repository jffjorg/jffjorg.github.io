And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to withdraw the general appearance of Caesarstone Ltd. and has stricken the notice of general appearance filed on January 16, 2024. Caesarstone Ltd. shall be considered a specially appearing defendant pending the resolution of its motion to quash service of summons. The court finds that Caesarstone Ltd. did not have authority to make a general appearance and that its counsel filed the appearance under the mistaken belief that it had authorization to do so. The court also finds that the motion to withdraw the general appearance is proper and that the proposed motion to quash service of summons has been presented to the court and the parties. The court orders that the motion to quash service of summons shall remain on calendar as scheduled and that briefing on that motion shall be completed pursuant to code.
