Summary in English text:

Judge Theresa M. Traber's tentative ruling denies Defendant Amy Pham's renewed motion to require Plaintiff Bruce Dwain Copeland to furnish security as a vexatious litigant. The motion was brought outside the 10-day time limit set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. The Court finds that Defendant Pham has failed to state any facts or law that would entitle her to an order that Plaintiff post an undertaking to maintain his claims against her. The Court also notes that Defendant Pham's papers do not demonstrate any legal basis for her request and the Bank's motion did not speak to her entitlement to security.

On the other hand, the Court grants Defendant U.S. Bank's Motion to Dismiss for Plaintiff's failure to furnish security, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 391.4. The Court orders that Plaintiff's claims against Defendant U.S. Bank National Association, As Trustee for GSAA Home Equity Trust 2006-12, Asset Backed Certificates Series 2006-12 must be dismissed without prejudice.
