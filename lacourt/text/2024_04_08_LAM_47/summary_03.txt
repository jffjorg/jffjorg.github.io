And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' motion to compel arbitration is granted. The plaintiff, Julian Urbina Huicochea, filed an employment discrimination action against the defendants, Brightview Landscape Services, Inc., Brightview Landscape Development, Inc., and Brightview Landscapes, LLC. The defendants argue that the plaintiff signed an arbitration agreement as part of his employment contract, which delegates questions of scope, validity, and enforceability to the arbitrator.

The plaintiff challenges the enforceability of the agreement, citing unconscionability. However, the judge finds that the agreement is procedurally unconscionable only to a minimal degree, and that the plaintiff has not demonstrated substantive unconscionability.

The judge notes that the agreement prohibits asserting claims that are otherwise covered by the Arbitration Agreement in a class, collective, or representative action, but that this provision is limited only to the extent permitted by law. The judge finds that this provision does not meet the plaintiff's heightened burden to demonstrate substantive unconscionability.

As a result, the judge grants the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and sets a status conference for a report on the status of the arbitration proceeding for April 7, 2025.
