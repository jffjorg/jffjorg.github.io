On December 16, 2023, Plaintiff, Sophia Henry, filed this
action against Defendants Rob Bonta, acting as California Attorney General for
the State of California (“Bonta”), Ana M. Lasso, acting as Director of
Department of General Services Office of Risk and Insurance Management for
State of California (“Lasso”); the State of California, Employment Development
Department (EDD), and Paid Family Leave Office—Fresno (collectively,
“Defendants”), arising from the denial of Plaintiff’s Paid Family Leave claim.  Plaintiff is self-represented. 
 
On March 8, 2024, the clerk of the court entered default
against the State of California, EDD, and Paid Family Leave Office – Fresno.
 
On March 26, 2024, the clerk of the court entered default
against Bonta and Lasso.  
 
On June 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed this Motion to Advance
Default Judgment Hearing Under the Trading With The Enemy Act (TWEA).  On June 18, 2024, Plaintiff also filed a
Request for Attorney’s (Consul’s) Fees Under the Trading With The Enemy Act
(TWEA). [1]
 
            On July 8,
2024, Defendants filed a Motion for Order Setting Aside Default Based Upon
Defective Notice, And Removal To Federal Court.  Defendants’ motion is scheduled to be heard on
September 4, 2024.  
 
            Given
Defendants’ pending motion may well moot Plaintiff’s Motion to Advance (and
concurrently filed Request for Attorney’s Fees), the court CONTINUES the Motion
to Advance to September 4, 2024.
 
 
Clerk of the court to give notice.
