[1] TCR’s contention that it is not
arguing substantial compliance is convoluted and ultimately, unpersuasive.  TCR appears to argue that a licensee must
raise the issue of substantial compliance, meaning it is TCR, not AWI, who may
seek an evidentiary hearing on substantial compliance.  TCR, however, does not supply any authority
for that proposition.  At bottom, TCR’s
licensure status is at issue.  Section
7031 mandates an evidentiary hearing.


[2] However, when that hearing should
take place (well in advance of the trial or immediately before the trial or as
part of a bifurcated proceeding.) is open for discussion.
