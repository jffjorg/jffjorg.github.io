And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the motion for an evidentiary hearing under Business and Professions Code section 7031(e) regarding the licensure status of TCR Services, Inc. AWI Builders, Inc. disputes TCR's licensure and argues that TCR failed to comply with licensing requirements during the performance of the contract. The judge finds that AWI has controverted TCR's licensure status and therefore an evidentiary hearing is warranted. The hearing will be held to determine whether TCR substantially complied with licensing requirements during the performance of the contract.
