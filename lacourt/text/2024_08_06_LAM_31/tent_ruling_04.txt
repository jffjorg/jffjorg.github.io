I.          INTRODUCTION
 
Plaintiff Rajan Garg (“Garg” or “Plaintiff”) became the
medical director and CEO of San Andres Medical Clinic, Inc. (SAMC) in January
of 2017.  Defendant Daniel Peraza was the
previous medical director and CEO of SAMC. 
In July of 2022, the Trustee of SAMC filed a medical malpractice lawsuit
against SAMC, Garg, and several other defendants.  In November of 2022, the Trustee and the
various defendants agreed to settle the matter for $250,000.  Under the terms of the settlement, defendants
were to make an initial payment of $60,000 with the remaining settlement
balance paid at a rate of $10,000 per month, for nineteen (19) months.  As relevant here, Garg and Peraza verbally
agreed they alone would be responsible for the settlement payments.  Garg and Peraza further agreed they would
each pay half of the initial $60,000 payment and half of each of the $10,000
remaining payments.  For the next few
months, the parties, abided by the oral agreement.  In February of 2023, Peraza failed to pay his
portion of the monthly installment. 
Peraza has not made any payments since then, forcing Garg to pay the entire
$10,000 monthly installment payment. 
 
On September 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against
Peraza for (1) Breach of Contract and (2) Intentional Misrepresentation.  Plaintiff seeks attorney fees and punitive damages,
among other relief.
 
On March 6, 2024, Defendant filed this Demurrer and Motion
to Strike attorney fees and punitive damages from the Complaint.
 
Plaintiff filed an opposition.  Defendant replied.  
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD
 
“The primary function of a
pleading is to give the other party notice so that it may prepare its¿case
[citation], and a defect in a pleading that otherwise properly notifies a party
cannot be said to affect substantial rights.” (Harris v. City of Santa
Monica (2013) 56 Cal.4th 203, 240.)¿ 
“A¿demurrer¿tests the legal sufficiency of the factual
allegations in a complaint.” (Ivanoff v. Bank of¿America, N.A.¿(2017)
9 Cal.App.5th 719, 725.) The Court looks to whether “the complaint
alleges¿facts sufficient to state a cause of action or discloses a complete
defense.” (Id.) The Court does not “read passages from a complaint in
isolation; in reviewing a ruling on a demurrer, we read the¿complaint ‘as a
whole and its parts in their context.’ [Citation.]” (West v. JPMorgan Chase
Bank,¿N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 804.)  The Court
“assume[s] the truth of the properly pleaded¿factual allegations, facts that
reasonably can be inferred from those expressly pleaded and matters of¿which
judicial notice has been taken.” (Harris, supra, 56 Cal.4th p.
240.) “The court does not,¿however, assume the truth of contentions, deductions
or conclusions of law. [Citation.]” (Durell v.¿Sharp Healthcare
(2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)¿ 
 
A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated
to support the cause of action asserted.¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.
(e).)¿“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint
is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under
modern discovery procedures.”¿ (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)¿¿¿ 
 
Where the complaint contains substantial factual
allegations sufficiently apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to
meet, a demurrer for uncertainty will be overruled or plaintiff will be given
leave to amend.¿ (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185
Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)¿ Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a
reasonable possibility of successful amendment.¿ (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to show the Court
that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)¿¿ 
 
III.      APPLICATION
 
A.   
Meet and
Confer 
 
Before filing a demurrer, the demurring party must meet and
confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party who filed
the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether
an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised by
the demurrer.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41(a).)¿Defense counsel has satisfied
the meet and confer requirement.¿ (See Declaration of Demurring or Moving Party
Regarding Meet and Confer.)¿¿¿¿¿ 
 
B.    
Analysis 
            
            Defendant argues
the First Cause of Action fails on the grounds that it is barred by the Statute
of Frauds and that the Second Cause of Action fails for lack of specificity.  The court addresses each argument in turn.
 
1.     
First Cause
of Action for Breach of Contract 
 
¿Plaintiff alleges that he and Defendant verbally agreed to
be solely responsible for the settlement payments, which consisted of an
initial payment of $60,000 and monthly payments of $10,000 for nineteen months. 
(Complaint, ¶¶ 14-16.)  Each party was to pay half of each settlement
payment.  (Complaint, ¶ 17.)  Defendant breached the agreement by failing
to contribute to any payments after February 2023.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 20-21.) 
 
The elements of a breach of contract cause of action are:
(1) the existence of a valid contract between the plaintiff and the defendant,
(2) the plaintiff’s performance, (3) the defendant’s unjustified failure to
perform, and (4) damages to the plaintiff caused by the defendant’s breach.  (CACI No. 303; Careau & Co. v. Security
Pacific Business, Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1371, 1388 (Careau); Otworth
v. Southern Pac. Transportation (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452, 458.)  “[T]he complaint must indicate on its face
whether the contract is written, oral, or implied by conduct.”  (Otworth, 166 Cal.App.3d at pp.
458-459.)¿ The elements of a breach of oral contract claim are the same as
those for a breach of written contract.  (Careau,
222 Cal.App.3d at p. 1388.)¿ 
 
Defendant argues the breach of contract claim fails because
it is barred by the Statute of Frauds.  Civil Code section 1624 codifies
the Statute of Frauds.  It states, in
relevant part, that an agreement that by its terms is not to be performed
within a year from the making thereof is invalid, unless there is some note or
memorandum in writing and subscribed by the party to be charged or by the
party’s agent.  (Civ. Code, § 1624, subd. (a)(1).) 
As alleged, the court agrees the Statute of Frauds bars
Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim.  The
alleged contract is not in writing.  (See
Complaint, ¶ 16.)  Further, the contract
is to be performed over nineteen months. 
(See Complaint, ¶ 15.)  The breach
of contract claims does not clear the bar raised by the Statute of Frauds
hurdle.  
 
In opposition, Plaintiff acknowledges that the parties “did
not enter into a formal written agreement” yet nonetheless argues the Complaint
adequately outlines the terms of the agreement. 
Plaintiff further references multiple emails and texts between the
parties which demonstrate the existence of the agreement.  These arguments are unavailing.  Plaintiff does not contend with Defendant’s
argument that the parties’ agreement is neither evidenced by a writing nor to
be performed within a year.  The Statute
of Frauds applies.  The references to
“multiple emails and texts … demonstrat[ing] the existence of the agreement”
cannot be considered in ruing on this demurrer because those communications
have not been pleaded and are therefore disregarded as extrinsic to the
Complaint.  \  
 
2.     
Second Cause of Action for Intentional
Misrepresentation 
 
Plaintiff alleges that “Defendant misrepresented to
Plaintiff that Defendant would make half of each of the monthly payments as set
forth in their Agreement” and that the representation was not true and made
with the intent to induce Plaintiff to enter into the settlement agreement with
the Trustee.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 32-33.)
 
“Fraud must be pleaded with specificity rather than with
‘“‘general and conclusory allegations.’”’ (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc.
(2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 184.) The specificity requirement means a plaintiff must
allege facts showing how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the
representations were made, and, in the case of a corporate defendant, the
plaintiff must allege the names of the persons who made the representations,
their authority to speak on behalf of the corporation, to whom they spoke, what
they said or wrote, and when the representation was made. (Lazar v. Superior
Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645; West v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
(2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 793.)¿¿ 
¿ 
 “Causes of action for intentional and negligent
misrepresentation sound in fraud and, therefore, each element must be pleaded
with specificity. (Daniels v. Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (2016)
246 Cal.App.4th 1150, 1166.)¿¿ 
¿ 
To establish a claim for deceit based on intentional
misrepresentation, the plaintiff must prove seven¿essential elements: (1) the
defendant represented to the plaintiff that an important fact was true; (2)
that representation was false; (3) the defendant knew that the representation
was false when the defendant made it, or the defendant made the representation
recklessly and without regard for its truth; (4) the defendant intended that
the plaintiff rely on the representation; (5) the plaintiff¿reasonably relied
on the¿representation;¿(6) the plaintiff was harmed; and (7) the plaintiff's
reliance on the defendant's representation was a substantial factor in causing
that harm to the plaintiff.¿ (Manderville¿v. PCG & S Group, Inc.¿(2007)
146 Cal.App.4th 1486, 1498; CACI No. 1900.)¿¿¿ 
 
            Defendant
argues the Second Cause of Action fails because it lacks the specificity
required for fraud claims and further, there are no allegations of intent to
defraud at the time the misrepresentations were made.  Defendant’s argument has merit.  The Complaint does not allege any facts
beyond the oral agreement between the parties to share equally in making the
settlement payments and Defendant’s breach of that agreement by failing to contribute
his share of payments after February of 2023.  In other words, Plaintiff attempts to base a
fraud claim solely upon nonperformance of an oral promise for future
conduct.  This is insufficient to state
support a claim for fraud.  “A promise of
future conduct is actionable as fraud only if made without a present intent to
perform. A declaration of intention, although in the nature of a promise, made
in good faith, without intention to deceive, and in the honest expectation that
it will be fulfilled, even though it is not carried out, does not constitute a
fraud. Moreover, something more than nonperformance is required to prove the
defendant’s intent not to perform his promise. . . . [I]f plaintiff adduces no
further evidence of fraudulent intent than proof of nonperformance of an oral
promise, he will never reach a jury.” (Magpali v. Farmers Group, Inc.
(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 481 (internal citations and quotations omitted).)  As Defendant correctly points out, there are
no specific allegations that Defendant did not intend to perform the agreement
at the time he made the promise to Plaintiff. 
The Second Cause of Action is deficient.
