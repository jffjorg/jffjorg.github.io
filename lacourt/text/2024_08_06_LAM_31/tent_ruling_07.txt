DEMURRER
WITHOUT MOTION TO STRIKE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
Galpin Motors
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Concepcion
Morales Ledesma
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND 
 
            On March 29,
2024, Plaintiff Concepcion Morales Ledesma filed this Song-Beverly action
against Defendants Ford Motor Company (“Ford”) and Galpin Ford (“Galpin”).  In 2023, Plaintiff purchased a 2020 Ford
Explorer (the “Vehicle”) with an express warranty.  As alleged, Ford failed to repair defects in the
Vehicle, and further, concealed defects in the Vehicle at the time of
Plaintiff’s purchase.  The Complaint
alleges causes of action for (1) Breach of Express Warranty, (2) Breach of
Express Warranty - Civil Code Section 1793.2(b), (3) Breach of Express Warranty
- Civil Code Section (a)(3), (4) Breach of Implied Warranty, (5) Fraudulent
Inducement - Concealment, and (6) Negligent Repair.  The Sixth Cause of Action is the only cause
of action asserted against Galpin.
 
            On May 20,
2024, Galpin filed this Demurrer to the Sixth Cause of Action.  
 
Plaintiff filed an opposition.  Galpin replied.
            
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint
states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747.)  When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context, accepting the alleged facts as true.  (Nolte
v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.) 
“Because a demurrer challenges defects on the face of the complaint, it can
only refer to matters outside the pleading that are subject to judicial
notice.”  (Arce ex rel. Arce v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc.
(2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 471, 556.) 
III.      DISCUSSION 
 
A.   
Meet and
Confer  
 
“Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video
conference with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer
for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would
resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.”¿(Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a).)  Defense counsel has
complied with the meet and confer requirement.¿ (See Declaration of Chen Fei
Liu, ¶ 2.)  
 
B.    
Analysis 
 
            Galpin
demurs to the sixth cause of action for negligent repair.  The Complaint alleges Plaintiff presented the
vehicle to Galpin for substantial repair “on at least one occasion” (Complaint,
¶ 87), and that Galpin breached its duty by failing to properly store, prepare
and repair of the subject vehicle in accordance with industry standards (Complaint,
¶ 89).  Further, Galpin’s negligent
breach of its duties owed to Plaintiff was a proximate cause of Plaintiff's
damages.  (Complaint, ¶ 90.)                
 
Galpin argues the negligent repair claim fails for two
reasons: (1) the economic loss rule bars Plaintiff’s negligent repair claim; and
(2) Plaintiff does not allege the element of damages.  The court agrees in considerable part with
Galpin’s second argument.  
 
Here, Plaintiff fails to specify the type of damages she
suffered because of Galpin’s alleged negligence in either her complaint or her
opposition brief.   Plaintiff is required to allege specific
facts showing that Galpin’s negligence caused or contributed to a non-economic
injury.  (See County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 292, 318 318 [“economic loss alone, without physical
injury, does not amount to type of damage that causes negligence cause of
action to accrue]; see also Seely v. White Motor Co. (1965) 63 Cal.2d 9,
17-18; Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th
979, 988 (Robinson).)  The
negligent repair claim is not sufficiently pleaded.
 
Further, because it is not clear what damages Plaintiff
suffered as a result of Galpin’s negligence, the court cannot determine the
merits of Galpin’s economic loss argument. 

 
The economic loss rule provides that, “[i]n general, there
is no recovery in tort for negligently inflicted ‘purely economic losses,’
meaning financial harm unaccompanied by physical or property damage.” (Sheen
v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 905, 922.)¿¿¿ “California
Courts define economic loss as ‘damages for inadequate value, costs of repair
and replacement of the defective product or consequent loss of profits—without
any claim of personal injury or damages to other property.’”  (Department
of Water & Power v. ABB Power T & D Co. (C.D .Cal. 1995) 902
F.Supp. 1178, 1186, fn. 4.)  The economic loss rule requires a purchaser
to recover in contract for purely economic loss due to disappointed
expectations unless she can demonstrate harm above and beyond a broken
contractual promise.  (Robinson, supra, 34 Cal.4th at pp.
988, 993 [economic loss rule prevents law of contract and law of tort “from
dissolving one into the other”].)
 
There exist four (4) exceptions to the economic loss rule
barring recovery in tort in a breach of contract action: (1) where the breach
of duty directly caused physical injury; (2) where there was a breach of the
covenant of good faith and fair dealing in insurance contracts; (3) for
wrongful discharge in violation of fundamental public policy; or (4) where the
contract was fraudulently induced.  (See Erlich v. Menezes (1999)
21 Cal.4th 543, 551-552; see Robinson, supra, 34 Cal.4th at pp.
989-990.) 
 
The parties spar over whether an exception applies to Plaintiff’s
negligent repair claim.  However, without
properly identifying Plaintiff’s damages, the arguments are undeveloped.  For instance, Plaintiff argues the economic
loss rule does not necessarily bar recovery in tort for damage a defective
product (e.g., a window) causes to other portions of a larger product (e.g., a
house) into which the former has been incorporated.  However, there are no allegations of a defect
in the Vehicle that caused damage to another portion of the Vehicle.  
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            Based on the foregoing, the demurrer to the Sixth Cause of
Action is SUSTAINED.  Leave to amend is
GRANTED.  
 
Plaintiff is ordered to serve and file the First Amended
Complaint within 30 days of the date of this order.
 
            Demurring
party to give notice.
