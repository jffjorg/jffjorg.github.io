  Case Number:  19STCP01306    Hearing Date:   May 7, 2024    Dept:  47 On April 23, 2024, Plaintiff Michael Fletcher  filed a
Trial Brief arguing that Defendant’s pleadings in the underlying Default
Judgment should be stricken pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7.
  Defendant Los Angeles County Child Support Services Dept. filed a
trial brief on April 25, 2024, opposing Plaintiff’s request to strike these
pleadings.
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7, if the Court
determines that subsection (b) has been violated, it may “impose an appropriate
sanction upon the attorneys, law firms, or parties that have violated
subdivision (b) or are responsible for the violation.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
128.7(c).) Violations of subsection (b) include presenting allegations which do
not “have evidentiary support” or are not “likely to have evidentiary support
after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 128.7(b)(3).) Sanctions under this section “shall be limited to
what is sufficient to deter repetition of this conduct or comparable conduct by
others similarly situated.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 128.7(d).)
 
Plaintiff contends that Defendant’s pleadings in the
underlying default judgment action should be stricken because Defendant’s Chief
Attorney, Alexandra Bauer, could not speak directly to the veracity of
Defendant’s filings in that action.  This assertion must be rejected for a
number of reasons.
 
First, Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 only permits a
party to attack a pleading under subdivision (b) via a separate motion with
sufficient advance notice to comply with the 21-day safe harbor period, as
required by subdivision (c). (Code Civ. Proc. § 128.7(b)-(c).) Second, as
Defendant states, it is settled precedent that sanctions under section 128.7
based on the improper filing or advocating of a pleading cannot be granted
after judgment has been entered. (Banks v. Hathaway (2002) 97
Cal.App.4th 949, 954; Hart v. Hart (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 410, 414.)
Finally—and most importantly—Plaintiff offers no authority standing for the
position that section 128.7 contemplates or authorizes an attack on a party’s
filings in one action through an entirely separate action. Plaintiff’s approach
ignores that sanctions under section 128.7 “are not designed to be punitive in
nature but rather to promote compliance with the statutory standards of
conduct.” (Hart, supra, 95 Cal.App.4th at 415 [internal citations omitted].)
A collateral attack on a party’s filings through a separate action does not
serve that purpose, and, if accepted, would threaten to expose any party to an
action to a flood of collateral litigation regarding the putative impropriety
of their pleadings from a sufficiently aggrieved litigant. The Court declines
to adopt such an extreme interpretation. 
 
Defendant’s filings in the underlying action may not be
stricken in this action under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7, nor will
the Court decline to take judicial notice of those filings on that basis, as
they are records of a court of this state and properly the subject of judicial
notice under Evidence Code section 452(d).
