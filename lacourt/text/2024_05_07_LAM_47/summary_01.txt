```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has declined to strike Defendant's pleadings in the underlying default judgment action, as Plaintiff's request was based on an incorrect interpretation of Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7. The court found that Plaintiff's approach ignored the purpose of section 128.7, which is to promote compliance with statutory standards of conduct, rather than to impose punitive sanctions. The court also noted that Plaintiff's request was not made in a separate motion with sufficient advance notice, as required by section 128.7(c).
