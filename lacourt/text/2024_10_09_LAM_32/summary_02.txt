And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is a summary of the court's decisions on three separate motions filed by the Defendant, Vermont City Lights LP.

The first motion was to compel the deposition of the Plaintiffs, Cornelia Rosales, Jose Juventino Rosales, and Jose Alfredo Rosales, due to their failure to appear for deposition as ordered by the court. The judge found that the Plaintiffs had not been forthcoming with their availability for deposition and had essentially evaded their depositions. The judge granted the motion and ordered the Plaintiffs to appear for their depositions in person at the defense counsel's office on a specified date.

The second motion was to set the expert fees of five experts designated by the Plaintiffs. The judge found that the fees were excessive and set new fees for each expert. The judge also granted the motion to extend the time for expert discovery.

The third motion was to continue the trial, which was originally set for November 12, 2024. The judge granted the motion, citing the Plaintiffs' failure to cooperate with discovery and the need for additional time to complete discovery. The trial was continued to a later date, which was not specified.

The judge also imposed a sanction of $1,340 against the Plaintiffs' counsel for failing to comply with the court's orders and for the Plaintiffs' evasive behavior in the discovery process.
