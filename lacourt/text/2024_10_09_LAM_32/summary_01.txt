Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment in this legal malpractice action. The plaintiff, Maryam Khani, alleges that the defendants, Bobby Babak Saadian and Wilshire Law Firm, PLC, were negligent in their representation of her in an underlying personal injury action. The plaintiff argues that the defendants' negligence caused her to receive an insufficient settlement amount and that she would have received a greater amount if not for the defendants' errors.

The judge finds that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the statute of limitations. The plaintiff filed this action in August 2022, more than one year after the settlement was executed in June 2021. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has failed to raise a factual dispute as to tolling or delayed discovery.

Additionally, the judge finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove causation and damages. The plaintiff has not presented any evidence showing that the other driver had assets beyond the policy limit of $250,000, and the plaintiff's own counsel has admitted that the plaintiff was unable to identify such assets. The judge concludes that the plaintiff's claims fail as a matter of law and that the defendants are entitled to summary judgment.
