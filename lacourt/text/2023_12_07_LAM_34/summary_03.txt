And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion for leave to file a third amended cross-complaint (TACC). The ruling is based on the defendants' argument that the proposed amendments are necessary and proper to allow adjudication on the merits of all liability and damages allegedly caused by the cross-defendants. The court finds that the proposed amendments are timely and that the risk of prejudice to the existing cross-defendants is minimal. The court also finds that the risk of prejudice to the defendants of not having leave to amend is high, as certain causes of action against existing parties appear to be compulsory causes of action. The court grants the defendants seven days' leave to file their proposed TACC.
