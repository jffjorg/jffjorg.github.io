ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal
Standard
 
On receipt of a
response to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and/or demand
requests, the propounding and/or demanding party “may move for an order
compelling further response” if: (1) the response is evasive or incomplete; (2)
the representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or
evasive; or (3) the objection is without merit or too general. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (a), 2031.310, subd. (a).)
 
The court shall
impose monetary sanctions against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further interrogatories
and/or a motion to compel further production of documents, unless the Court
finds that the one subject to sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (d), 2031.310, subd. (h).)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
A. 
    The
Parties’ Arguments
 
Plaintiff
moves the Court to: (1) compel Defendant to provide further verified responses
to certain requests for production of documents (“RPDs”) within seven days of
the Court’s order; and (2) order monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and
against Defendant and/or Defense Counsel, to be paid to Plaintiff’s Counsel
within seven days of the Court’s order. (Further RPDs Motion, p. 10:2–6.)
 
Defendant
opposes the Further RPDs Motion, arguing: (1) that the motion should be denied
because Defendant complied with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2031.210,
subdivision (a) and 2031.280, subdivision (a); (2) that Plaintiff did not meet
in confer or even attempt to meet and confer in good faith; (3) that Plaintiff
did not seek to resolve this discovery dispute through an informal discovery
conference; (4) that Plaintiff’s Request for Monetary Sanctions should be
denied; and (5) that the Court should instead impose monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s Counsel. (Opposition, pp. 2:17–19, 4:5–6, 5:8–9,
7:13, 10:2–3.)
 
In
his Reply, Plaintiff argues: (1) that the Parties did meet and confer; and (2)
that Defendant has not produced clear statements of compliance or inability to
comply pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.280, subdivision (a).
(Reply, pp. 2:12–15, 4:6–21.)
 
B. 
    Discussion
 
The
ancillary arguments made by the Parties can be quickly dispatched. Enough
evidence of the Parties’ respective Counsel meeting and conferring has been
submitted for that requirement to be satisfied. (Reply, pp. 2–4.) Further,
while the Court does strongly encourage informal discovery conferences, they
are not required in this situation. (Dept. 34 Rules, rules IV.D, VI.B.)
 
A
review of the Further RPDs Motion and Plaintiff’s Separate Statement indicates
that Plaintiff seeks a statement of compliance and/or a representation of
inability to comply for RPDs Nos. 1–4, 6–15, 17–24, 28–37. This is in response
to Defendant starting each response with the following sentence: “The
production, inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, and related activity
demanded, will be allowed either in whole or in part, and that all documents or
things in the demanded category that are in the possession, custody, or control
of the Defendant and to which no objection is made will be included in the
production.”
 
There
is nothing wrong with Defendant’s sentence. This is nearly an exact copy of the
statement required in Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.220: “A statement that the party to whom a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling has been directed will comply with the particular
demand shall state that the production, inspection, copying, testing, or sampling,
and related activity demanded, will be allowed either in whole or in part, and
that all documents or things in the demanded category that are in the
possession, custody, or control of that party and to which no objection is
being made will be included in the production.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.220, emphases added.) 
 
Further, when one gets past the boilerplate introductory clause,
Defendant has stated that “all documents . . . that are in the
possession, custody, or control of the Defendant and to which no objection is
made will be included in the production.”
 
Plaintiff’s arguments about Code of Civil Procedure sections
2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.280 lack merit.  Nonetheless, the Court reminds the Parties
that they must comply with the privilege log requirements of the discovery act
and case law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.240, subds. (a)–(c).)
 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff’s Further RPDs Motion. 
 
C. 
    Sanctions
 
1. 
    Plaintiff’s
Request for Monetary Sanctions
 
Plaintiff
requests monetary sanctions against Defendant and Defense Counsel. (Further
RPDs Motion, p. 2–6.) As Defendant prevailed on the Further RPDs Motion, such
monetary sanctions would be inappropriate.
 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff’s Request for Monetary Sanctions. 
 
2. 
    Defendant’s
Request for Monetary Sanctions
 
Defendant
requests monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s Counsel.
(Opposition, p. 10:19–21.) Defendant prevailed on the Further RPDs Motion. 
 
        The Court does not have
sufficient evidence before it that would indicate Plaintiff or Plaintiff’s
Counsel acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of a monetary sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (d), 2031.310, subd.
(h).) Thus, the Court must impose a monetary sanction on them. (Ibid.) 
 
It is not uncommon for courts to compare
opposing counsel’s fees to help determine whether the moving party’s fees are
reasonable. That is because a “comparative analysis of each side’s respective
litigation costs may be a useful check on the reasonableness of any fee
request.”¿¿(Mountjoy v. Bank of Am., N.A.¿(2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 266,
273, 281, quoting Donahue v. Donahue¿(2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 259, 272.)¿
 
“[T]here is one particularly good indicator of
how much time is necessary [for the purpose of determining reasonableness of
attorneys’ fees] . . . and that is how much time the other side’s lawyers
spent. . . . [S]uch a comparison is a useful guide in evaluating the
appropriateness of time claimed. If the time claimed by the prevailing party is
of a substantially greater magnitude than what the other side spent, that often
indicates that too much time is claimed. Litigation has something of the tennis
game, something of war, to it; if one side hits the ball, or shoots heavy
artillery, the other side necessarily spends time hitting the ball or shooting
heavy artillery back.” (Democratic Party of Washington State v. Reed
(9th¿Cir. 2004) 388 F.3d 1281, 1287.)
 
        Here,
Plaintiffs’ Counsel requested $5,985.00 in attorney’s fees and costs, based on fifteen
hours of work at $395.00 per hour, plus $60.00 in costs. (Further RPDs Motion,
Decl. Hindmarsh, ¶ 12.)
 
        In
contrast, Defense Counsel requested $4,400.00 in attorney’s fees and costs,
based on eight hours of work at $550.00 per hour. (Opposition, Decl. Gonzalez,
¶¶ 26–27.)
 
While the
Court would normally think that $4,400.00 is excessive considering the filings
made, the Parties’ respective Counsel appear to believe that this is an
appropriate amount. 
 
        The
Court AWARDS attorney’s fees and costs in favor of Defendant and against
Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s Counsel, jointly and severally, in the amount of
$4,400.00. 
 
III.    
Conclusion
 
The Further RPDs Motion is DENIED. 
 
Plaintiff’s Request for Monetary Sanctions is DENIED. 
 
        Attorney’s
fees and costs are AWARDED in favor of Defendant and against Plaintiff and
Plaintiff’s Counsel, jointly and severally, in the amount of $4,400.00.
