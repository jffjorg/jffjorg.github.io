BACKGROUND:
 
On February
27, 2020, Plaintiff Felicia McCarron filed her Complaint against Defendant Sisyphian,
LLC on causes of action arising from Plaintiff’s employment with Defendant. 
 
On November
17, 2020, the Court granted in part Defendant’s petition to compel arbitration
and severed a paragraph requiring Plaintiff to pay her own costs of arbitration.
The Court stayed the labor issues in this matter but allowed the Parties to
move to set the case for trial if arbitration had not concluded by December 31,
2021. 
 
On October
18, 2023, Plaintiff’s Counsel — K2 Employment Law, APC and Douglas H. Hoang —
filed: (1) MC-051, Motion to be Relieved as Counsel; (2) MC-052, Declaration;
and (3) MC-053, Proposed Order.
 
        On
November 7, 2023, Plaintiff’s Counsel filed amended versions of the MC-051,
MC-052, and MC-053.
 
No opposition
or other response has been filed to the motion, either in its original form or
as amended. 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
An attorney moving to be relieved
as counsel under California Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) must meet
the requirements set out in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. 
 
To comply with rule 3.1362, the
moving party must submit the following forms: (1) Notice of Motion and Motion
to be Relieved as Counsel; (2) Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to
be Relieved as Counsel; and (3) Order Granting Attorney's Motion to be Relieved
as Counsel. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a), (c), (e).) 
 
The moving party must serve the
aforementioned forms on the client and all other parties who have appeared in
the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) Further, when the client is
served by mail, the attorney's declaration must show that the client's address
was confirmed within the last 30 days and how it was confirmed. (Id.)  
 
Absent a showing of resulting
prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be granted.  (People v. Prince (1968) 268
Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) 
 
II.      
Discussion
 
Counsel’s Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel (including the amended filings) complies with all of the requirements
of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, in that Counsel provided notice of
motion and motion to be relieved as counsel; proposed order granting attorney’s
motion to be relieved as counsel; and declaration in support of the motion to
be relieved as counsel. 
 
The amended declaration states that
Plaintiff’s Counsel are unable to continue their representation of Plaintiff
because the relationship of trust and confidence essential to the attorney-client
relationship has ceased to exist. (Amended MC-052.)
 
Trial is scheduled to begin in more
than seven months from the date of the hearing on the motion. Relieving
Plaintiff’s Counsel at this time poses little risk of prejudice to Plaintiff,
who will have ample time to find new counsel should she choose to do so. 
 
III.     Conclusion
 
The Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel is GRANTED.
