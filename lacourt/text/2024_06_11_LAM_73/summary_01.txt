And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge rules that the demurrer to the Cross-Complaint's first, second, and third causes of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. The Cross-Complaint fails to state sufficient facts to establish the equitable indemnity and indemnity causes of action. The Court agrees that the Cross-Complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to show fault on the part of the indemnitor and resulting damages to the indemnitee. The demurrer is sustained as to the first and second causes of action. The third cause of action for declaratory relief is also sustained due to the lack of sufficient facts showing how the Cross-Defendants ratified the Cross-Complainants' actions.
