ORDER
  GRANTING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS



 
I.              
BACKGROUND 
This personal
injury case arises out of a pedestrian/motor vehicle accident that allegedly
took place between Plaintiff Diane Williams (“Plaintiff”) and Defendants Salma
Halloumi (“Salma”) and Mohamed Halloumi (collectively, “Defendants”) on April
6, 2023. 
This Court granted Salma’s
discovery motions, including her Motion to Deem Requests for Admission (“RFAs”)
Admitted, on October 9, 2024; Defendants now move for a judgment on the
pleadings.
/// 
II.           
PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
On December
8, 2023, Plaintiff filed her Complaint, alleging negligence. 
On April 8,
2024, Defendants filed their Answer. 
On May 17,
2024, Plaintiff substituted her attorney to represent herself. 
On October 9,
2024, the Court granted Salma’s discovery motions, including her Motion to Deem
RFAs Admitted. 
On November
5, 2024, Defendants filed the instant Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
(“Motion”).
On December
18, 2024, Defendants filed their Notice of Plaintiff’s Non-Opposition. 
III.        
LEGAL STANDARD 
“A motion for judgment on the pleadings
performs the same function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only
defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that can be
judicially noticed.” (Burnett v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th
1057, 1064.) In considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings, courts
consider whether the factual allegations, assumed true, are sufficient to
constitute a cause of action. (See Fire Ins. Exchange v.
Superior Court (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452-53.) Thus, it may be granted
if, from the pleadings, together with matters that may be judicially noticed,
it appears that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (See Code
Civ. Proc. § 438(d); Saltarelli & Steponovich v. Douglas (1995) 40
Cal.App.4th 1, 5.).[1]
A defendant or plaintiff’s
motion for judgment on the pleadings may be made after the time to demur has
expired and an answer has been filed. (Code Civ. Proc. § 438(f).)
///
IV.         
MEET AND CONFER
“Before
filing a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the moving party shall meet and
confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading
that is subject to the motion for judgment on the pleadings for the purpose of
determining if an agreement can be reached that resolves the claims to be
raised in the motion for judgment on the pleadings.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 439(a)
(emphasis added).)          
Defendants’ counsel declares she
telephonically met and conferred with Plaintiff but that the parties were
unable to reach an agreement. (See Declaration of Lilit Mkrtchyan filed
November 5, 2024, ¶ 13.) The Court finds Defendants have satisfied their meet
and confer obligations. 
V.            
ANALYSIS
A.            
Judicial Notice
A court may take judicial notice of a party's
admissions or concessions, but only in cases where the admission “can not
reasonably be controverted,” such as in answers to interrogatories or requests
for admissions [citations].¿(Arce v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc.¿(2010) 181
Cal.App.4th 471, 485.)
The Court thus
takes judicial notice of its October 9, 2024, order deeming the contents of Salma’s
RFAs admitted against Plaintiff, as well as its Notice of Ruling, Plaintiff’s Substitution
of Attorney, Plaintiff’s Complaint, and Salma’s RFAs. (See Defendants’
Request for Judicial Notice, ¶¶ 1-5, Exs. A-E.) 
B.            
Defendants’ Motion is Granted.
     Here, Defendants move for judgment on the
pleadings on the grounds that “[p]ursuant to the Court's order of October 9,
2024, Plaintiff has admitted, among other relevant admissions, that her own
negligence was the sole cause of the incident, and that she did not suffer any
injuries or damages”, completely contradicting Plaintiff’s allegations in her
Complaint. (Motion, pg. 8.)
          Plaintiff
did not oppose. 
The Court
finds Defendants are entitled to an order granting judgment on the pleadings. Based
on the Court’s October 9, 2024, order, Plaintiff has admitted, among other
admissions, that her own negligence was the sole cause of the incident (RFA No.
1) and that Plaintiff suffered no property damage or injuries as a result of
the alleged accident (RFAs Nos. 4-10). (See Defendants’ Request for
Judicial Notice, ¶ 2, Ex. B.) Plaintiff’s admissions directly contradict the
allegations of her Complaint. (See Complaint.) 
Accordingly, Defendants’
Motion is GRANTED.  
VI.         
CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, the Court GRANTS Defendants’
Motion for Judgment on
the Pleadings. 
Defendants shall
submit a Proposed Judgment to the Court.
The Court
shall set an Order to Show Cause re: Entry of Judgment on March 13, 2025, at 8:30
a.m.
IT IS SO
ORDERED.
DATED:      January 13, 2025

Judge,
  Superior Court
