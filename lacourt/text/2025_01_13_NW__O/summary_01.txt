And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings. The motion was filed on November 5, 2024, and the defendants argued that the plaintiff, Diane Williams, had admitted to her own negligence being the sole cause of the incident and that she did not suffer any injuries or damages. The plaintiff did not oppose the motion. The judge took judicial notice of the admissions made by the plaintiff in response to requests for admissions, which contradicted the allegations in the plaintiff's complaint. As a result, the judge found that the defendants were entitled to judgment on the pleadings and granted their motion. The defendants will submit a proposed judgment to the court, and the court will set an order to show cause re: entry of judgment on March 13, 2025.
