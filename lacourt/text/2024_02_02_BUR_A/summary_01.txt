Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion by California Automobile Insurance Company (CalAuto) to amend its answer to the Third Amended Complaint. The motion seeks to add an additional affirmative defense that the four-year statute of limitations bars Plaintiff's claim. CalAuto claims that this defense was inadvertently omitted from its first amended answer.

The Court has granted the motion, finding that CalAuto has submitted sufficient declarations in support of its motion and has fulfilled the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324(a) and (b). The Second Amended Answer to Third Amended Complaint filed by CalAuto on December 4, 2023 is deemed the operative answer.

The Court notes that Plaintiff has rendered no opposition to the motion, and that requests to amend answers are to be liberally considered. The case management conference set for April 24, 2024 remains.
