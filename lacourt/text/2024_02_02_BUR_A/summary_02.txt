And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions brought by the Plaintiff, Rebecca Brudzynski, against the Defendant, Peoples Action Power. The motions include a request to join additional parties to the lawsuit, a request to quash deposition subpoenas, and requests to compel further responses to interrogatories and requests for production.

The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's motion to join additional parties is defective and denies it without prejudice. The Judge also denies the motion to quash the deposition subpoenas, but notes that the Defendant's requests for production and interrogatories are reasonable and allowed by law.

The Judge also denies the motions to compel further responses to interrogatories and requests for production, finding that the Plaintiff has not complied with the rules of court and has not provided sufficient evidence to support her claims. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff has waived her privacy interest in her mental health records, which are directly relevant to her claims against the Defendant.

The Judge orders that the motions are denied without prejudice, and that the Defendant is to give notice to the Plaintiff. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff may re-file her motions if she can provide sufficient evidence and comply with the rules of court.
