And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings pending arbitration. The plaintiff, Azad Khachatrian, brought an action against Hillsdale Treatment Center, LLC, Timothy Dailey, and Eric Niccole for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The defendants filed a motion to compel arbitration, citing an arbitration clause in the Management Service Agreement between the parties. The court found that the arbitration clause is valid and enforceable, and that the dispute is subject to arbitration. The court also ordered a stay of proceedings pending arbitration, as required by California law. The case management conference is vacated, and a status conference is set for August 29, 2024, to monitor the progress of the arbitration.
