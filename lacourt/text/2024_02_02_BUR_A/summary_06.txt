And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further discovery responses brought by the defendant. The plaintiff has failed to respond to the defendant's discovery requests, including interrogatories and requests for production of documents. The judge finds that the defendant is entitled to further responses to his interrogatories and grants the motion to compel further production to Form Interrogatories Nos. 4.1, 6.4, 6.5, 10.1, and 20.2. The judge also grants the motion to compel further responses to RFPD Nos. 1-14.

The judge awards sanctions to the defendant in the amount of $702.33, which includes four hours of attorney work and a filing fee. The judge finds that this amount is reasonable to compensate for the cost of the motions. The judge orders the plaintiff to provide further responses to the discovery requests within 30 days and awards sanctions to be paid within 30 days.
