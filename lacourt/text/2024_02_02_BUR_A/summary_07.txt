And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a demurrer and motion to strike in a case involving a dispute over a 60-day Notice to Quit served by the defendants on the plaintiffs. The notice stated the defendants' intent to demolish or substantially remodel the residential real property, and the plaintiffs allege that the defendants did not have a good-faith intent to do so. The judge finds that the plaintiffs' causes of action, to the extent they are based on the filing of the 60-day Notice to Quit, are barred as a matter of law by the litigation privilege. However, the judge grants the plaintiffs 20 days' leave to amend their complaint to state additional causes of action. The judge also strikes certain allegations requesting punitive damages and attorneys' fees. The case is set for a case management conference on April 9, 2024.
