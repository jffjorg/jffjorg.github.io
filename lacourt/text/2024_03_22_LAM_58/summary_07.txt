```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motions to compel arbitration, which means that the disputes between the parties will be resolved through arbitration rather than through the courts. The judge has also stayed the matter pending the outcome of the arbitration. Additionally, the judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, which would have temporarily blocked the defendants from enforcing the arbitration agreement. The judge's decision is based on the fact that the parties have agreed to arbitrate their disputes and that the arbitration agreement is enforceable. The judge has also found that the plaintiff has not demonstrated irreparable harm that would justify the issuance of a preliminary injunction.
