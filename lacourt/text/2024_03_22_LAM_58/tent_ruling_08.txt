expressly concedes this point. (Opp. To Netflix, p. 1, fn. 3.)


[2]           In opposition, Netflix also argues that Plaintiff’s
request for preliminary injunction is overbroad based on her seeking to enjoin all contracts for
employment entered by either Delirium or Netflix. The Court agrees. (Common Cause v. Board of Supervisors (1989) 49 Cal.3d 432, 443 [“[T]here is no possibility
that the relief sought could be properly awarded after a trial on the merits,
such relief may not be awarded on a provisional basis.”].) Moreover, the Court harbors
grave doubts Plaintiff has standing to request such sweeping relief.
