v. Lin
Case No.:                    23STCV06272
Motion:                       Petitions
to Approve Compromise of Pending Action on Behalf of Minor 
Moving Party:             Plaintiff/Petitioner
Aura Baten Lopez
Opposing Party:          None

Tentative Ruling:      The
petitions to approve compromise of pending action on behalf of a minor are granted.


             
            This is a habitability case. Plaintiffs Hector Geovany Gonon Chay, Aura
Baten Lopez, Juan Sajbin Tiu, Francisca Margarita Coxic Gonzalez De Sajbin, Pedro
Rigoberto Sajbin Coxic, Edwin Josue Baten Lopez (a minor) and Keyla Araceli
Gonon Baten (a minor) sued Defendant the Estate of Albert K. Lin (Lin) for
breach of warranty of habitability, breach of implied covenant of quiet
enjoyment, negligence, and breach of contract.  
 
            Plaintiffs have settled the case
with Defendant for $155,000. Plaintiff/Petitioner Aura Baten Lopez now seeks
approval of a compromise of the claim on behalf of minors, Edwin Josue Baten Lopez and Keyla Araceli Gonon Baten.

 
Discussion
 
            Court approval is
required for all settlements of a minor’s claim. (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) California Rules of Court, rule 7.950
provides that a petition “must be verified by the petitioner and must contain a
full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness
of the compromise.” The Petition must be filed on Judicial Council Form
MC-350 and must be fully completed. 
 
            The Petition is properly filed on the Judicial Council
forms and is verified. Plaintiff/Petitioner has also submitted the requisite
attachments with the Petition.  
            
            Of
the $155,000 in settlement funds, $10,000 will be allocated to Edwin Josue Baten Lopez and Keyla
Araceli Gonon Baten ($5,000 each). This action
involved two separate families in two separate units. One family of two adults
and two minors settled for $85,000, with $37,000 for each of the adults. The
second family consisted of three adults and settled for $75,000 with each adult
receiving $25,000. The Petition asserts that the minor settlement amount
compensates Edwin Josue
Baten Lopez and Keyla Araceli Gonon Baten for
damages to personal property, personal injury, emotional distress and rent
abatement. (Pet., ¶ 6.)  
 
            As to
attorney’s fees, the retainer agreement provides for a 33 1/3% contingency fee
from adults and 25% from minors. (Attachment 17(a)(2).) Counsel requests $1,250
for each petition, which excludes costs in the amount of $516.47. In support, she
provides a declaration of tasks and services rendered during the course of this
case, which resulted in total working hours of approximately 25 hours. (Attachment
13(a).)
 
Counsel’s declaration also supports the factors of
reasonableness under California Rules of Court, rule 7.955(b). (See generally, Fishenfeld
Decl., ¶¶ 2-11.) Upon consideration of those facts, the Court finds that the
amount of $3,233.53 per minor petition is reasonable.  
Plaintiff
has satisfied all of procedural and substantive requirements. Therefore,
the petitions are granted.
