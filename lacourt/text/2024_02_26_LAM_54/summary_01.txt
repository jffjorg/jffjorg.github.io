And here is the English-text summary:

In this tentative ruling, Judge Maurice Leiter grants the Cross-Complainants' Motion to Set Aside Dismissal. The Cross-Complainants, represented by Dariush G. Adli and Adli Law Group, Inc., argue that their counsel inadvertently failed to appear on January 4, 2024 due to technical issues, and that Cross-Defendants/Plaintiffs made misrepresentations regarding bankruptcy proceedings. The Court finds good cause to vacate the dismissal, citing the mistake of Cross-Complainants' counsel. The Court notes that it cannot determine from this motion whether the claims of Cross-Complainants against one or more of the Cross-Defendants have been addressed in the bankruptcy proceedings and, if so, whether that bars Cross-Complainants from proceeding in this Court. If Cross-Defendants wish to pursue this argument, they should make a proper motion and include relevant documents from the bankruptcy proceedings.
