And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to transfer the case to Orange County. The court finds that the proper venue is Orange County because that is where the vehicle was purchased, the contract was signed, and the witnesses are located. The court also finds that the convenience of witnesses would be promoted by the transfer, as all key witnesses are affiliated with Fletcher Jones in Orange County. The court orders the plaintiffs to pay the costs of the transfer.
