 Hearing Date:  August 6, 2024
 Calendar Number:  7



 
 
 
Defendants Com2us USA, Inc. (“Com2us USA”) and Kyu Chang Lee
(collectively, “Moving Defendants”) demur to the Second Amended Complaint
(“SAC”) filed by Plaintiffs Sunwoo Lee and Myunga Cho (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”).
 
The Court OVERRULES the demurrer.
 
The Court, sua sponte, strikes Plaintiffs’ claims under
their first cause of action relating to purchases which occurred prior to May
9, 2022.
 
The Court emphasizes that this document is a tentative order
only.  The Court solicits arguments in
particular on: (1) whether there is a legal requirement at the pleading stage
to do more than allege that “Defendants” sold the securities to plaintiff; and
(2) whether there are legal principles that the Court can apply at the pleading
stage that securities sold on a foreign exchange may not be subject to certain
claims.  In making their arguments,
Moving Defendants are reminded of the California pleading rules that require
the Court to accept as true the allegations of the SAC.
 
Background
 
This is a securities fraud case. The following facts are
taken from the allegations of the SAC, which the Court accepts as true for the
purposes of the demurrer.
 
Defendant Com2us Holdings is a corporation organized under
the laws of the Republic of Korea. Defendant Com2us Corp. is a subsidiary of
Com2us Holdings. Defendant Com2us USA is a subsidiary of Com2us Holdings.
Defendant Lee is the CEO of Com2us.
 
The Com2us companies developed C2X tokens, which are a type
of cryptocurrency. The Com2us companies developed C2X to interact with
videogames, where C2X would function as a currency in the video game.
 
Plaintiffs allege that Defendants offered and sold C2X
tokens through an initial exchange offering (“IEO”) on the FTX exchange. The
IEO took place on March 18, 2022. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants marketed
and sold C2X tokens in California. Although Moving Defendants present evidence
that they excluded the United States from their marketing efforts, the Court is
not able to consider such evidence at the pleading stage.
 
Plaintiffs allege that Defendants made a number of
misrepresentations about how C2X would function, including representations that
C2X would be part of a virtual ecosystem where it was the sole cryptocurrency
and that C2X would have multiple associated videogames. Many of these
representations allegedly occurred in a C2X Whitepaper, which Plaintiffs allege
that Moving Defendants shared publicly on Twitter.
 
Plaintiffs are California residents. Plaintiffs allege that
they purchased shares of C2X in California via the FTX exchange.
 
Between April and May 2022, Defendants provided a ‘staking
program’ to owners of C2X, wherein customers staked their existing C2X tokens
by purchasing a separate digital asset and then used their C2X tokens to gain
additional ‘LP tokens’ from Defendants. (SAC ¶¶ 4, 60.) Plaintiffs allege that
they staked all of their C2X tokens.
 
Plaintiffs allege that, as a result of their investment in
C2X, they suffered economic losses.
 
Plaintiff filed this action on May 9, 2023. The operative
complaint is now the SAC, which raises claims for (1) violations of sections 5
and 12(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933; (2) violations of sections 5 and
12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933; (3) violation of section 15 of the
Securities Act of 1933; (4) violation of Corporations Code, sections 25110 and
25503; (5) violations of Corporations Code, sections 25401 and 25501; (6)
violation of Corporations Code, section 25504; (7) violation of Corporations
Code, section 25504.1; (8) intentional misrepresentation; (9) negligent
misrepresentation; and (10) conversion.
 
Moving Defendants demurred to the SAC on April 2, 2024.
Plaintiffs filed an opposition and Moving Defendants filed a reply.
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
The Court grants Moving Defendants’ request for judicial
notice. The Court takes notice of the existence of Exhibits B and C as public
records. The Court takes notice of Exhibit A as a document referenced in
Plaintiffs’ SAC. The Court takes judicial notice of the existence of these
documents, but not of the truth of their contents.
 
Legal Standard
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading
alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants,
Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) The court assumes the truth
of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.) The only issue a demurrer is
concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of
action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be
allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335,
348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Ibid.;
Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f
there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause
of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).
 
Discussion
 
Length of Demurrer
 
On November 20, 2023, the Court ordered that Moving
Defendants’ demurrer may be up to 25 pages in length. Moving Defendants’
demurrer is 23 pages long, and therefore is not improperly long.
 
(1) Violations of Sections 5 and 12(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933
 
15 U.S.C., section 77l, also known as Securities Act,
section 12, imposes liability to purchasers on any person who offers or sells a
security in violation of 15 U.S.C., section 77e (also known as Securities Act,
section 5). (15 U.S.C., § 77l, subd. (a)(1).) 
 
Extraterritoriality
 
The Securities Act applies only to transactions made within
the United States. (Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd. (2010) 561
U.S. 247, 268-269.)
 
Moving Defendants argue that Plaintiffs do not allege a
domestic transaction.
 
Plaintiffs allege that Defendants solicited purchases of CTX
throughout the world, including in California. (SAC ¶ 1.) Plaintiffs allege
that Defendants sold CTX tokens to Plaintiffs in California. (SAC ¶ 107.)
Plaintiffs’ claims, as alleged, are therefore not extraterritorial.
 
Statute of Limitations
 
Section 77l has a 1-year statute of limitations. (15
U.S.C., § 77m.)
 
Plaintiffs filed this action on May 9, 2023. Moving
Defendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot state claims for purchases prior to May
9, 2022. Plaintiffs allege that they purchased unregistered C2X tokens from
Defendants from March 23, 2022 to August 18, 2022. The purchases prior to May
9, 2022 therefore do not form the basis for a timely claim.
 
“The appropriate procedural device for challenging a portion
of a cause of action seeking an improper remedy is a motion to strike.” (Caliber
Bodyworks, Inc. v. Superior Court (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 365, 385,
disapproved of on other grounds by ZB, N.A. v. Superior Court (2019) 8
Cal.5th 175.) In Caliber Bodyworks, the Court of Appeal directed the
trial court to strike, sua sponte, portions of the plaintiff’s claims for which
the plaintiff had not exhausted its administrative remedies. (Ibid.)
 
To the extent that Moving Defendants argue that Caliber
Bodyworks compels the Court to strike Plaintiff’s untimely allegations here,
the Court disagrees.  The ability to
strike portions of a pleading sua sponte is discretionary. (Code Civ. Proc., §
436.) However, because the parties have fully briefed the issue of timeliness,
the Court finds that it would be appropriate to strike Plaintiff’s claims under
this cause of action which predate May 9, 2022.
 
Allegations that Moving Defendants sold tokens to Plaintiffs 
 
Plaintiffs allege that they purchased shares from all
Defendants (SAC ¶¶ 56, 57, 60.) Moving Defendants argue that Plaintiffs do not
specifically name Moving Defendants in these allegations. The Court disagrees.
Plaintiffs’ allegation that they purchased shares from all Defendants provides
adequate notice to moving Defendants of the claim against them.
 
The Court overrules the demurrer to this claim.
 
(2) Violations of Sections 5 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933;
 
15 U.S.C., section 77l, subd. (a)(2) provides for the
same remedies as subdivision (a)(1), against any person who offers or sells a
security in interstate commerce “by means of a prospectus or oral
communication, which includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits
to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (the
purchaser not knowing of such untruth or omission), and who shall not sustain
the burden of proof that he did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable
care could not have known, of such untruth or omission.” (15 U.S.C., § 77l,
subd. (a)(2).)
 
Allegations that Moving Defendants sold tokens to Plaintiffs 
 
As discussed above, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have
adequately alleged that Defendants sold shares to Plaintiffs.
 
Allegations of Prospectus
 
Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not alleged the
existence of a prospectus. 
 
“[T]he word “prospectus” is a term of art referring to a
document that describes a public offering of securities by an issuer or
controlling shareholder.” (Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., Inc. (1995) 513 U.S.
561, 584.)
 
Plaintiffs allege that on February 7, 2022, Defendants
published a “C2X Whitepaper” for investors to learn more about C2X tokens and
the C2X ecosystem. Plaintiffs allege that the C2X Whitepaper was made to
provide information about the public offering of C2X by Defendants, who issued
C2X. Plaintiffs have therefore alleged that the C2X Whitepaper is a prospectus.
 
Plaintiffs allege that the Twitter account of XPLA Games
tweeted the C2X Whitepaper. Plaintiffs alleges that Com2us USA and Defendant
Lee retweeted the Whitepaper on or around the same day. Plaintiffs specifically
allege a number of misrepresentations in the Whitepaper, including manipulated
data (SAC ¶ 31), that there would be a single NFT marketplace with C2X tokens
as its primary currency (SAC ¶ 37), that C2X tokens would be the primary token
used in the associated video games (SAC ¶ 40), and that several video games
would be part of the C2X ecosystem (SAC ¶ 41). Plaintiffs have therefore
adequately alleged that Moving Defendants made misrepresentations in a
prospectus.
 
Particularity
 
Plaintiffs allege with particularity that Defendants Com2us
and Lee retweeted the C2X Whitepaper around February 7, 2022. They also allege
specific misrepresentations about C2X in the C2X Whitepaper. Plaintiffs have
therefore pled this claim with adequate particularity.
 
The Court overrules the demurrer to this claim.
 
(3) Violation of Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933
 
“Every person who, by or through stock ownership, agency, or
otherwise, or who, pursuant to or in connection with an agreement or
understanding with one or more other persons by or through stock ownership,
agency, or otherwise, controls any person liable under sections 77k or 77l of
this title, shall also be liable jointly and severally with and to the same
extent as such controlled person to any person to whom such controlled person
is liable, unless the controlling person had no knowledge of or reasonable
ground to believe in the existence of the facts by reason of which the
liability of the controlled person is alleged to exist.” (15 U.S.C., § 77o.)
 
Moving Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not pled that
Moving Defendants are controlling persons.
 
Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Lee is the CEO of Com2us
USA. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants possessed the power to direct the
management and policies of Com2us Holdings, Com2us Corp., and Com2us USA.
Furthermore, Com2us USA necessarily controlled its members, who would be the
people who actually took the actions involved in making the C2X offerings.
 
Plaintiffs have therefore pled that Moving Defendants are
controlling persons.
 
As discussed above, the Plaintiffs have adequately alleged
that Defendants, including, Moving Defendants sold C2X tokens to Plaintiffs.
 
The Court therefore overrules the demurrer to this claim.
 
(4) Violation of Corporations Code, Sections 25110 and 25503
 
“It is unlawful for any person to offer or sell in this
state any security in an issuer transaction (other than in a transaction
subject to Section 25120), whether or not by or through underwriters, unless
such sale has been qualified under Section 25111, 25112 or 25113 (and no order
under Section 25140 or subdivision (a) of Section 25143 is in effect with
respect to such qualification) or unless such security or transaction is
exempted or not subject to qualification under Chapter 1 (commencing with Section
25100) of this part. The offer or sale of such a security in a manner that
varies or differs from, exceeds the scope of, or fails to conform with either a
material term or material condition of qualification of the offering as set
forth in the permit or qualification order, or a material representation as to
the manner of offering which is set forth in the application for qualification,
shall be an unqualified offer or sale.” (Corp. Code, § 25110.)
 
Corporations Code, section 25503, provides for the remedies
available against a defendant who violates section 25110. (Corp. Code, §
25503.)
 
Privity between Plaintiffs and Moving Defendants
 
Moving Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ Corporations Code
claims fail for lack of privity based on their argument that Plaintiffs have
not alleged that Plaintiffs purchased CTX tokens from Moving Defendants. As
discussed above, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have adequately alleged that
they purchased unregistered CTX tokens from Moving Defendants. The Court
therefore finds that lack of privity is not a basis to dismiss any of
Plaintiffs’ Corporations Code claims.
 
Purchases in California
 
Moving Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not alleged
purchases made in California. As discussed above, Plaintiffs have alleged that
Moving Defendants sold them CTX tokens in California. (SAC ¶ 107.)
 
The Court therefore overrules the demurrer to this claim.
 
(5) Violations of Corporations Code, Sections 25401 and 25501
 
“It is unlawful for any person to offer or sell a security
in this state, or to buy or offer to buy a security in this state, by means of
any written or oral communication that includes an untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which the statements
were made, not misleading.” (Corp. Code, § 25401.)
 
Corporations Code, section 25501, provides for the remedies
available against a defendant who violates section 25401. (Corp. Code, §
25501.)
 
The facts constituting the alleged fraud must be alleged
factually and specifically as to every element of fraud, as the policy of
“liberal construction” of the pleadings will not ordinarily be invoked. (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12
Cal.4th 631, 645.)
 
Privity between Plaintiffs and Moving Defendants
 
As discussed above, Plaintiffs have adequately alleged
privity.
 
Particularity
 
Moving Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not alleged
this claim with adequate particularity for a fraud claim. As discussed above,
Plaintiffs have adequately alleged that Moving Defendants disseminated the C2X
Whitepaper on Twitter around February 7, 2022, and have alleged specific ways
in which the C2X Whitepaper was misleading. Plaintiffs have therefore stated
their claim with adequate particularity. These allegations also rebut Moving
Defendants’ argument that Plaintiffs have not alleged that Moving Defendants
materially assisted in the violation.
 
The Court overrules the demurrer to this claim.
 
(6) Violation of Corporations Code, Section 25504
 
“Every person who directly or indirectly controls a person
liable under Section 25501 or 25503, every partner in a firm so liable, every
principal executive officer or director of a corporation so liable, every
person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions, every
employee of a person so liable who materially aids in the act or transaction
constituting the violation, and every broker-dealer or agent who materially
aids in the act or transaction constituting the violation, are also liable jointly
and severally with and to the same extent as such person, unless the other
person who is so liable had no knowledge of or reasonable grounds to believe in
the existence of the facts by reason of which the liability is alleged to
exist.” (Corp. Code, § 25504.)
 
Allegations of control-person liability
 
Moving Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not adequately
alleged the either of Moving Defendants was a controlling person. As discussed
above, Plaintiffs have adequately alleged control-person liability as to Moving
Defendants.
 
Material Assistance
 
As discussed above, Plaintiffs have adequately alleged
material assistance by alleging the Moving Defendants disseminated the C2X
Whitepaper on Twitter. Moving Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not alleged
sufficiently specific facts showing knowledge of falsity. “[Fraud’s] particularity requirement necessitates pleading
facts which ‘show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the
representations were tendered.’ [Citation.]” (Stansfield v. Starkey
(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 59, 73.) Plaintiffs have alleged that Defendants knew
that the representations they made were false (Complaint ¶ 137); it is
difficult to see how a Plaintiff could allege further evidentiary facts absent
an admission by Defendants or later conduct showing that they knew the
representations to be false.
 
The Court therefore overrules the demurrer to this claim.
 
(7) Violation of Corporations Code, Section 25504.1 
 
“Any person who materially assists in any violation of
Section 25110, 25120, 25130, 25133, or 25401, or a condition of qualification
under Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 25110) of Part 2 of this division
imposed pursuant to Section 25141, or a condition of qualification under
Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 25120) of Part 2 of this division imposed
pursuant to Section 25141, or an order suspending trading issued pursuant to
Section 25219, with intent to deceive or defraud, is jointly and severally liable
with any other person liable under this chapter for such violation.” (Corp.
Code, 25504.1.)
 
Moving Defendants group their arguments against this claim
with their arguments against Plaintiffs’ section 25504 claim. For the same
reason that the Court rejects those arguments, the Court overrules the demurrer
to this claim.
 
(8) Intentional Misrepresentation
 
“The elements of a cause of action for intentional
misrepresentation are (1) a misrepresentation, (2) with knowledge of its
falsity, (3) with the intent to induce another’s reliance on the
misrepresentation, (4) actual and justifiable reliance, and (5) resulting
damage.” (Daniels v. Select Portfolio
Servicing, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1150, 1166.) The facts constituting
the alleged fraud must be alleged factually and specifically as to every
element of fraud, as the policy of “liberal construction” of the pleadings will
not ordinarily be invoked. (Lazar v.
Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.) 
 
To properly allege fraud against a corporation, the
plaintiffs must plead the names of the persons allegedly making the false
representations, their authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said
or wrote, and when it was said or written. (Tarmann
v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.)
 
Particularity
 
Moving Defendants argue that
Plaintiffs have not alleged this claim with sufficient particularity. As
discussed above, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have stated their fraud claims
with adequate particularity.
 
The Court overrules the demurrer
to this claim.
 
(9) Negligent Misrepresentation
 
The elements of a cause of action for
negligent misrepresentation include “[m]isrepresentation of a past or existing
material fact, without reasonable ground for believing it to be true, and with
intent to induce another’s reliance on the fact misrepresented; ignorance of
the truth and justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation by the party to
whom it was directed; and resulting damage.” (Hydro-Mill Co., Inc. v. Hayward, Tilton & Rolapp Ins. Associates,
Inc. (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 1145, 1154, quotation marks omitted.) The facts
constituting the alleged fraud must be alleged factually and specifically as to
every element of fraud, as the policy of “liberal construction” of the
pleadings will not ordinarily be invoked. (Lazar
v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.) 
 
To properly allege
fraud against a corporation, the plaintiff must plead the names of the persons
allegedly making the false representations, their authority to speak, to whom
they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was said or written. (Tarmann v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.
(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.)
 
“California courts
have recognized a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation, i.e., a duty
to communicate accurate information, in two circumstances. The first situation
arises where providing false information poses a risk of and results in physical
harm to person or property. The second situation arises where information is
conveyed in a commercial setting for a business purpose.” (Friedman v. Merck & Co. (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 454, 477.)

 
Particularity
 
Moving Defendants argue that
Plaintiffs have not alleged this claim with sufficient particularity. As
discussed above, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have stated their fraud claims
with adequate particularity.
 
The Court overrules the demurrer
to this claim.
 
(10) Conversion
 
“Conversion
is the wrongful exercise of dominion over the property of another. The elements
of a conversion claim are: (1) the plaintiff’s ownership or right to possession
of the property; (2) the defendant’s conversion by a wrongful act or
disposition of property rights; and (3) damages.” (Lee v. Hanley (2015) 61 Cal.4th 1225, 1240.) “It is not necessary
that there be a manual taking of the property; it is only necessary to show an
assumption of control or ownership over the property, or that the alleged
converter has applied the property to [their] own use.” (Oakdale Village
Group v. Fong (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 539, 544.)

“Conversion requires the defendant to take some affirmative
action to exercise dominion over or deprive a plaintiff of his or her
property.” (Archer v. Coinbase, Inc. (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 266, 276.)
            
Defendants argue that it is FTX’s cessation of withdrawals
that is responsible for Plaintiffs’ loss of access to their C2X tokens.
However, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants wrongfully withheld access to
Plaintiffs’ C2X tokens from October 21, 2022 to November 8, 2022, prior to the
FTX cessation of withdrawals on November 8, 2022, which adequately alleges an
interference with Plaintiffs’ ownership during that time period.
 
The Court overrules the demurrer to this claim.
