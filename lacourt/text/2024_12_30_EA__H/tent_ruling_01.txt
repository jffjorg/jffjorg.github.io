No. 21PSCV00537


ORDER ON
DEFAULT JUDGMENT APPLICATION
 
Plaintiffs Olivia Hernandez and Sugey Lopez’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
 
Background
This
lawsuit involves a Property Assessed Clean Energy/Home Energy Renovation
Opportunity loan. Plaintiffs Olivia Hernandez (“Hernandez”) and Sugey Lopez
(“Lopez”) (together, “Plaintiffs”) allege that, in the fall of 2018, Esmeralda de
Vasquez (“de Vasquez”) and Aldo Manuel Perez Martinez (“Perez Martinez”),
acting as unlicensed agents for Danneco Construction (“Danneco”), came to
Hernandez’s home located at 569 La Seda Road, La Puente, California 91744 (the
“Property”) and represented to Hernandez that they could build an extra
dwelling unit on same for $55,000.00, that they could help her obtain a loan
for the project, that the loan would not take the form of a lien, that she
would not have to repay the loan until the unit was complete, and that rental
income from the unit would pay for the loan. Although Hernandez was a Spanish
speaker and the presentation was made in Spanish, the contracts provided to
Hernandez were in English. Lopez is a co-owner of the Property. The total cost
of the project was over $120,000.00 and the loan was ultimately recorded as a
municipal tax lien against the home. Perez Martinez forged or fraudulently procured
Hernandez’s signature on a completion certificate before any work had been
performed.
On
October 4, 2021, the Clerk entered default against Dan Thanh Danh’s (“Danh”).
On October 5, 2021, the Clerk entered default against Danneco. On January 3,
2022, the Clerk entered default against de Vasquez and Perez Martinez.
On
February 23, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC” or the “Operative
Complaint”), asserting causes of action against Danneco, de Vasquez, Perez
Martinez, Danh, the County of Los Angeles, and Does 1-10 for:
          1.       Intentional
Misrepresentation,
          2.       Fraudulent
Concealment,
          3.       Negligent
Misrepresentation,
          4.       Financial
Elder Abuse (Welf. & Inst. Code, §§ 15657.5-15657.6; Prob. Code, § 859),
          5.       Unfair
and Deceptive Business Practices (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200 et seq.),
          6.       Rescission
of Contracts,
          7.       Cancellation
of Home Solicitation Contract (Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1689.5-1689.14),
          8.       Cancellation
of Instruments (Civ. Code, § 3412),
          9.       Declaratory
Relief,
          10.     Breach
of Contract, and
          11.     Breach
of the Implied Warranty of Fitness for a Particular Purpose.
On
November 4, 2022, Plaintiffs dismissed the County of Los Angeles, with
prejudice. On July 5, 2023, Plaintiffs dismissed de Vasquez, without prejudice.
Pending
before the Court is Plaintiffs’ Application for Default Judgment.
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiffs’ Application for
Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
          1.       Plaintiffs have alleged that Hernandez is
an “elder” within the meaning of Welfare & Institutions Code § 15610.27[FN] (See FAC, ¶ 129) and claim entitlement to Probate Code § 859 double damages in
the amount of $244,240.40. Plaintiffs have not provided the Court with any
evidence that Hernandez was 65 years of age or older in the fall of 2018, the
time when the wrongful conduct occurred. Hernandez attests only that she is a
“senior citizen.” (Hernandez Decl., ¶ 1.) The Court requests that Hernandez
provide an amended declaration setting forth her date of birth.
          2.       Plaintiff Hernandez does not
affirmatively attest that she only speaks, reads, and understands Spanish.
          3.       Plaintiffs have alleged that they made a
complaint against Danneco with the Contractor State Licensing Board and that “[t]his
complaint is currently pending and has not been resolved.” (FAC, ¶ 66.)
Plaintiffs are directed to provide the court with information regarding the
status of this complaint, as well as of their notice of claim filed against Renovate
set forth in Paragraph 69 of the Operative Complaint.
          4.       Plaintiffs’ attachment to proposed
judgment includes overly broad permanent injunction language. (Compare with FAC
Prayer, ¶ 11.)
Accordingly, for the foregoing
reasons, the application is denied without prejudice. Plaintiffs are directed to
submit a revised, full, and complete default judgment packet that addresses the
aforementioned issues.
