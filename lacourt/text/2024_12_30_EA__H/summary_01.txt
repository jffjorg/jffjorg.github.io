And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiffs' application for default judgment without prejudice. The judge notes several defects in the application, including:

1. The plaintiffs have not provided evidence that Hernandez was 65 years of age or older in 2018, which is a requirement for entitlement to double damages under Probate Code § 859.
2. Plaintiff Hernandez does not affirmatively attest that she only speaks, reads, and understands Spanish.
3. The plaintiffs have not provided information regarding the status of their complaint against Danneco with the Contractor State Licensing Board.
4. The plaintiffs' attachment to the proposed judgment includes overly broad permanent injunction language.

The judge directs the plaintiffs to submit a revised, full, and complete default judgment packet that addresses these issues.
