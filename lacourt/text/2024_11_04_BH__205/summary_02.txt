And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by Plaintiff Sheila Nasre to enforce a settlement agreement and require Defendant Benham Kazemi Movahed to lower the MLS listing price for a property located at 603 North Doheny Drive, #2B, Beverly Hills, CA. The parties entered into a settlement agreement on February 21, 2024, which required that the parties agree on a sales price or use an independent appraisal to determine the sales price. The Plaintiff obtained two independent appraisals, which valued the property at $1,375,000 and $1,300,000, respectively. The Defendant failed to lower the MLS listing price to $1,375,000 as requested by the Plaintiff.

The judge grants the Plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement agreement and requires the Defendant to lower the MLS listing price to $1,300,000. The judge also awards the Plaintiff $2,700 in attorneys' fees, which is based on the Plaintiff's hourly rate of $450 and the six hours spent on the motion. The judge concludes that the hourly rate and the number of hours billed are reasonable, and that the degree of success obtained by the Plaintiff is the critical factor in determining the reasonableness of the fee.
