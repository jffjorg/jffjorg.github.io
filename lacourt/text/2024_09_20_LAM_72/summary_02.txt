And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made tentative rulings on six motions in limine brought by the plaintiffs, Sergio Garcia and Crystal Garcia, against General Motors, LLC. The court granted motions to limit the introduction of testimony or evidence that the plaintiffs did not participate in a third-party dispute resolution program, and to prohibit expert testimony from a witness who was not designated as an expert witness. The court denied motions to prohibit the introduction of certain evidence, including a document that appears to be admissible as a business record, and to prohibit "argument" rather than evidence. The court also denied a motion to prohibit the introduction of evidence related to the plaintiffs' treatment of the vehicle, finding that the evidence is relevant. Finally, the court denied a motion to penalize General Motors for allegedly violating a court order, finding that the motion lacked specific evidence to support the claim.
