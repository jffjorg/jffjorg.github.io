And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions in limine filed by Alterra Mountain Company U.S., Inc. (Defendant). The first motion, which seeks to exclude evidence related to the Defendant's eighth affirmative defense, is denied as it constitutes a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication, which cannot be brought in the form of a motion in limine.

The second motion, which seeks to exclude evidence generally, is also denied as it is too broadly phrased to be subject to a useful ruling on a motion in limine. The Defendant may raise objections to specific evidence at trial if it was subject to a discovery request and not disclosed in discovery.

The third motion, which seeks to exclude evidence of settlement negotiations, is granted. Neither party may introduce evidence of settlement negotiations before the jury, and any party seeking to introduce such evidence must bring the issue to the court's attention outside the presence of the jury.

The judge has also noted that the parties have failed to comply with the court's trial preparation order, which requires the parties to file a joint exhibit list, meet and confer about the admissibility of exhibits, file a joint witness list, and file a joint pretrial binder. The judge has continued the final status conference to a further final status conference prior to the trial to ensure that the parties comply with their pretrial obligations.
