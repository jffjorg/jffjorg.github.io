And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, issued a tentative ruling granting Infinity Insurance Company's motion for leave to intervene in the case. Infinity seeks to intervene to protect its interests as the automobile insurer for defendant Cesar Augusto Campos Orellana. The Judge found that Infinity has a sufficient interest to intervene in the case, as it may be subject to a subsequent action under Insurance Code section 11580 by a judgment creditor who has or will obtain a default judgment against Orellana. The Judge ordered Infinity to file a separate copy of its complaint-in-intervention and serve it on all parties within 10 days. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
