The motion was uncontested and filed by Counsel, who claims that an irreparable breakdown in the working relationship has occurred, making it difficult to provide effective representation. Counsel has served the plaintiff by mail and has filed proof of service. The judge notes that the plaintiff has not opposed the motion and that there is sufficient time for the plaintiff to seek new counsel before the trial date. The judge orders Counsel to file proof of service of the final order within 10 days and sets a date for an Order to Show Cause re: Proof of Service of the Final Order.
