And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Justin Biggers v. Ralphs Grocery Company, ET AL. The case involves allegations of assault and battery, and Ralphs has filed a cross-complaint against American Guard Services (AGS). AGS has moved for terminating sanctions to dismiss the Plaintiff's complaint, claiming that the Plaintiff failed to comply with the Court's March 15, 2024 order to serve verified responses to AGS' discovery. The Judge has denied AGS' motion without prejudice, stating that there appears to be an issue with service of the moving papers. The Judge notes that if the papers were served electronically, the Court requires proof that the Plaintiff consented to electronic service. The Judge encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement and orders the moving party to give notice.
