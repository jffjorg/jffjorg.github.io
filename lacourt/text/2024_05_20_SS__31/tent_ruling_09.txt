AGS now moves for terminating sanctions to dismiss Plaintiff’s complaint on the grounds that Plaintiff failed to comply with the Court’s March 15, 2024 order to serve verified responses to AGS’ discovery.   Here, there appears to be an issue with service of the moving papers. The proof of service filed with the Court contains a declaration indicating that the papers were served via electronic service. If the papers were served electronically, the Court requires some proof that the Plaintiff consented to electronic service. CCP 1010.6.  Based on the foregoing, AGS’ motion for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff’s complaint is therefore DENIED without prejudice.   Moving party is ordered to give notice.   PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 20th day of May 2024      Hon.
