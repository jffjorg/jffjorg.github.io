And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court denied Hertz's motion for reconsideration of the amount awarded in monetary sanctions. The Court found that Hertz did not provide a sufficient showing of new or different facts, circumstances, or law to warrant reconsideration. Additionally, the Court determined that Hertz had the opportunity to address the issue of sanctions in its opposition to the motion to compel further responses and did not demonstrate "mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect" that would justify relief under section 473(b). The Court therefore denied Hertz's motion for reconsideration.
