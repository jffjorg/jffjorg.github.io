And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The applicant, Felicia Hubert, seeks to appear as counsel pro hac vice to represent plaintiff Shannon Jaworski in this action. The application was previously denied without prejudice due to failure to comply with Cal. Rules of Court, rule 9.40(c)(1). The renewed application has cured the defect by providing proof of service on the State Bar. However, the motion is denied without prejudice on procedural grounds due to inadequate notice. The judge finds that the applicant failed to provide the requisite statutory notice, specifically 16 court days prior to the hearing. The judge orders the applicant to give notice and sets the matter for further proceedings. The judge encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and provides instructions for submitting to the tentative ruling.
