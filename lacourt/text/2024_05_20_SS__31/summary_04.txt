And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by the Defendant, Rafael Fajardo. The Defendant moved to compel the deposition of the Plaintiff, Peter Daniel Doss, and to pay monetary sanctions. The Plaintiff is in pro per and was served with the motion papers by mail. However, the Judge denied the motion to compel deposition without prejudice due to the issue of the timing of service. The Judge ruled that the notice of motion was not served in a timely manner and did not provide the requisite statutory notice. The Judge also denied the motion to continue the trial date by approximately six months for the same procedural reason. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if necessary, to submit to the tentative ruling.
