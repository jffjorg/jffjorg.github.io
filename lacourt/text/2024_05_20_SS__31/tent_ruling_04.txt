MOTION TO COMPEL DEPOSITION Defendant Rafael Fajardo (“Defendant”) moves to compel plaintiff Peter Daniel Doss (“Plaintiff Doss”) to appear for his deposition and to pay monetary sanctions. As of October 19, 2023, Plaintiff Doss is in pro per. The motion was previously denied without prejudice on procedural grounds due the lack of meet and confer declaration pursuant to (CCP § 2025.450(b)(2)). (Min. Order, April 8, 2024.) Defendant has cured this defect on the renewed motion. However, the motion is denied without prejudice due to the issue of the timing of service.  Pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §1005, “all moving and supporting papers shall be served and filed at least 16 court days before the hearing.” “However, if the notice is served by mail, the required 16-day period of notice before the hearing shall be increased by five calendar days if the place of mailing and the place of address are within the State of California…” (CCP §1005(b).) Here, the hearing is set for May 20, 2024. Counting backwards from the date of the hearing, 16 court days prior falls on April 26, 2024. However, Plaintiff was served by mail, and therefore an additional five calendar days must be accounted for. Thus, Plaintiff must have been served with the moving papers no later than April 22, 2024. (CCP §1005(b); CRC, Rule 1.10(b).) However, the proof of service here provides that Plaintiff was served on April 26, 2024.  Based on the foregoing, the instant motion fails to provide the requisite statutory notice and is DENIED without prejudice on this ground.  II.  MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL Defendant moves to continue the current trial date of June 24, 2024 by approximately six months. The hearing date for this motion was reserved for May 20, 2024, but Plaintiff was served by mail on April 26, 2024. For the same reasons as above in denying Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition, the service of the motion fails to comply with the requirements of CCP §1005(b).  Accordingly, the motion is DENIED without prejudice on procedural grounds.   Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 17th day of May 2024      Hon.
