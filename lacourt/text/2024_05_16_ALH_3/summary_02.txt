And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to compel arbitration filed by Defendant Tesla, Inc. The Plaintiff, Alejandra Moreno, and her co-plaintiff Sergio Fernando Moreno, brought an action alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (SBA). The Defendant filed a motion to compel arbitration, which the Plaintiffs did not oppose. The Court finds that the Defendant has met its initial burden to show that an agreement to arbitrate exists between the parties. The agreement, contained in the Motor Vehicle Order Agreement (MVOA), includes an opt-out provision allowing the buyer to opt out of arbitration within 30 days of signing the agreement. Since the agreement encompasses "any dispute", the Plaintiffs' claims under the SBA are subject to arbitration. The motion is granted, and the Plaintiffs are ordered to arbitrate their claims. The action is stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration.
