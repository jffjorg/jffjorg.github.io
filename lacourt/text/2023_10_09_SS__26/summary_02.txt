And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Steigleder v. Badalyans. The ruling states that Cross-Defendant Peter Steigleder's demurrer to the First Amended Cross-Complaint is sustained with 20 days' leave to amend. In other words, Cross-Defendant's arguments against the complaint are accepted, but Cross-Complainant is given an opportunity to refile the complaint with additional details.

The ruling also states that Cross-Defendant's motion to strike portions of the First Amended Cross-Complaint is placed off calendar as moot. This means that the motion is no longer relevant since the demurrer has been sustained.

The judge's reasoning is based on several factors, including the lack of specificity in the allegations of fraudulent misrepresentation, the confusion in the allegations of breach of oral contract, and the failure to state a cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

The judge has also granted leave to amend to Cross-Complainant, allowing them to refile the complaint with additional details.
