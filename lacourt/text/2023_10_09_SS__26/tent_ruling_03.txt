ANALYSIS:
 
Defendant Manuel Ocampo (“Defendant”)
propounded Form Interrogatories, Set One and Request for Production of
Documents, Set One, on Plaintiffs Yohanson Walkir Castellanos Orozco and Ana
Lucia Elizabeth Lantan Garcia (“Plaintiffs”) on April 28, 2023. (Motions,
McEwan Decl., Exh. A.) Following Plaintiffs’ failure to respond, Defendant
sought to meet and confer. (Id. ¶¶4-5 and  Exh. B.) When there was no response from
Plaintiffs after the extended deadline, Defendant filed the instant (1) Motion
to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions;
and (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set
One, and Request for Sanctions on August 16, 2023. To date, no opposition has
been filed. 

 
Discussion
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, 2031.300.) Further, the motion can be brought any time after the
responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
2031.300.) Based on Plaintiffs’ failure to respond to the propounded discovery,
Defendant is entitled to an order compelling service of verified responses to
the discovery requests without objections. 
 
Plaintiffs’ failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. However, the amount sought is excessive.
Pursuant to a lodestar calculation, sanctions are awarded in the amount of $520.00
based on two hours of attorney time billed at $200.00 per hour, and $60.00 in
costs. (Motions, McEwan Decl., ¶7.)  
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Manuel Ocampo’s (1)
Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions;
and (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set
One, and Request for Sanctions are GRANTED.
