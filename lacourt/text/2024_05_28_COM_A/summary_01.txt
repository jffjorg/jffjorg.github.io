And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to compel compliance with the deposition subpoena and denies their request for monetary sanctions. The defendants served a deposition subpoena on Elizabeth Lezama, a non-party witness, to appear for testimony and produce records. The witness refused to appear for deposition, citing her age (19) and her role as a full-time student helping her mother who sustained an injury. The court finds that there is no evidence that the witness willfully refused to appear for deposition and therefore denies the defendants' request for sanctions. However, the court admonishes the witness that failure to comply with a deposition subpoena may be punished as contempt of court and imposition of monetary sanctions if the witness fails to appear.
