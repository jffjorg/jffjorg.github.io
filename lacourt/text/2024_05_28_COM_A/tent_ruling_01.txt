[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING
 DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE WITH DEPOSITION SUBPOENA; REQUEST FOR
 MONETARY SANCTIONS
 
      This
action arises from an automobile accident. Defendants served a deposition
subpoena on Elizabeth Lezama, a non-party witness, to appear for testimony and
produce records. Defendants argue that the witness refused to appear on March
5, 2024, warranting imposition of sanctions of $1,060.00.
      The
witness submits a declaration stating she is 19-years old and a full-time
student and helping her mother who sustained injury. She will be available for
deposition between June 10, 2024, and June 24, 2024.
      An
oral deposition may be used to obtain discovery of a person who is not a party
to the action in which the discovery is sought. (Code Civ. Proc., §2020.010(a)(1).
) Personal service of any deposition subpoena is effective to require personal
attendance and testimony at a deposition. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.220(c)(1);
1987.1.)
      Defendants’
motion is GRANTED.  Defendants are ordered
to meet and confer with the witness to schedule a mutually convenient date for
a deposition. There is no evidence that the witness willfully refused to appear
for her deposition. There is no evidence that the witness willfully refused to
appear for deposition under the circumstances, and therefore, Defendants’
request for sanctions is DENIED. However, the witness is admonished that
failure to comply with a deposition subpoena may be punished as contempt of
court and imposition of monetary sanctions should the witness fail to appear.
