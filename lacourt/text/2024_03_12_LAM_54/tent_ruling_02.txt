BACKGROUND
               
This is a lemon law action arising out
of Plaintiffs’ purchase of 2022 Lucid Air Grand Touring
manufactured and distributed by Defendant Lucid Group USA, Inc.
 
ANALYSIS
 
The Song-Beverly Act provides, “[i]f
the buyer prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed
by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate
amount of costs and expenses, including attorney's fees based on actual time
expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer
in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.” (Civ. Code
§ 1794(d).) 
 
Plaintiffs assert that the Law Offices
of Adam Zolonz, APC incurred $52,510.00 in fees and $1,102.45 in costs to
prosecute this action. Plaintiffs request that the Court apply a 1.5
multiplier, for an additional $26,255.00 in fees. 
 
1. Multiplier
 
Plaintiff requests that the Court apply
a 1.5 multiplier to counsel’s fees due to the novelty, difficulty, and skill
displayed in the case and the contingent nature of the case. The Court is
permitted, but not required, to apply a multiplier to an award for attorney’s fees
if, inter alia, there was contingent risk or exceptional skill displayed
by the attorneys. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1138.) In applying a multiplier for
contingent risk, “the trial court
should consider whether, and to what extent, the attorney and client have been
able to mitigate the risk of nonpayment…” (Id.) There is no evidence
that this case involved anything novel, nor did it require exceptional skill.
This is a standard lemon law action. There is no basis for a multiplier.
 
2. Lodestar
 
Plaintiff seeks $52,510.00 in fees to
prosecute this case. Plaintiff’s counsel charges between $150.00 and $600.00
per hour and spent 105.4 hours on this case over approximately one year.
Defendant argues that counsel’s hours are unreasonable and counsel’s hourly
rates are excessive. The Court does not take issue with counsel’s hourly rates.
The Court also does not find counsel’s billing entries excessive. None of the
entries cited by Defendant are so egregious to warrant being reduced, including
those occurring after the notice of settlement. The Court finds counsel’s fees reasonable.
 
3. Costs
 
Defendant does not dispute costs.
 
Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED in the
amount of $52,510.00 in attorney fees and $1,102.45 in costs.
