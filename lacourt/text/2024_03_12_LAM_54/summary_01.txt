And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiffs' motion to change the venue of the trial from Los Angeles to Orange County. The court finds that the motion lacks evidence and argument to support the claim that an impartial trial cannot be had in this court. The plaintiffs originally named the County of Los Angeles as the defendant, but later amended the complaint to name the Los Angeles Superior Court as the defendant. The court rules that there is no evidence to show that Judge Leiter, who is assigned to the case, cannot be fair and impartial. The court also notes that the plaintiffs have not shown that they cannot receive a fair and impartial trial in this court. The motion is denied, and the parties are notified to submit any further arguments or evidence by email by 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
