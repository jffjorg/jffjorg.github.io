And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Sunlight Financial, LLC's motion to quash a subpoena for business records. The subpoena was served on Sunlight's registered agent, but the company is a resident of Delaware and North Carolina, not California. Therefore, the subpoena was not properly served under California law. The judge has ruled that California has subpoena power only over residents of California, and since Sunlight is not a resident of California, the subpoena is quashed.
