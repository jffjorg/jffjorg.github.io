This is a tentative ruling by Judge Maurice A. Leiter regarding a motion to compel arbitration filed by Defendant The Guestology Group, Inc. in Case No. 23STCV22242. The Plaintiff, Amanda Lynch, filed a complaint against the Defendant on September 14, 2023, alleging Labor Code and FEHA violations, retaliation, and wrongful termination.

The Court finds that the Defendant has met its burden to establish an agreement to arbitrate, but the agreement is unenforceable as to the claims for sexual harassment and discrimination, which are exempt from arbitration under the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (EFASASHA). The Court grants the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration as to the remaining claims.

The Court also finds that the arbitration agreement is not procedurally or substantively unconscionable, despite some minor deficiencies in the agreement. The action is stayed pending arbitration of the remaining claims.
