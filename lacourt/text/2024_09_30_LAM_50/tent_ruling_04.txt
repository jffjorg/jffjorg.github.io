[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff Woori America Bank (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default
judgment against Defendants Darian Foods Inc. and Hwa Ok Yang. Plaintiff seeks judgment
in the total amount of $46,110.24, comprising $37,931.89 in damages, $2,828.24
in interest, $3,737.31 in costs, and $1,612.80 in attorney’s fees. 
The Court notes a few defects with the submitted default judgment
package.
First, Item
1(e)(1) of the proposed judgment (Form JUD-100) should not be checked.
Second, Plaintiff
seeks interest at the rates of 10.25% and 10.5%. (Han Decl., ¶ 21.) Pursuant to
LA¿SC rule 3.206¿, “[i]f interest is requested in
excess of the usury limitations of ¿California
Constitution Article XV, Section 1¿, proof must be presented of plaintiff’s
exemption from the usury limitations unless an exemption has been pleaded in
the complaint and admitted by the entry of default.” The Complaint does not
appear to plead any exemption from the usury limitations and Plaintiff has not
provided an explanation for its entitlement to any exemption.¿¿
Third, Plaintiff indicates
that “[t]he per diem interest rate between September 18, 2023, and September
30, 2023 (12 days) was 10.25% (prime rate of 8.25 plus 2), which equals
10.80.” (Han Decl., ¶ 21, emphasis added.) It is unclear what “10.80”
refers to, or how Plaintiff arrived at this number. Similarly, Plaintiff states
that “[t]he per diem interest rate between October 1, 2023, and June 4, 2024
(244 days) was 10.5% (prime rate of 8.5 plus 2), which equals 11.06.”
(Han Decl., ¶ 21, emphasis added.) It is unclear what “11.06” refers to, or how
Plaintiff arrived at this number.
Fourth, as
noted in the Court’s July 30, 2024 Order on Plaintiff’s prior request for
default judgment, this is an action on a promissory
note (Compl., ¶ 11). The supporting declaration of Sang Ouk Han
provides that “[a]s part of the normal course
of business, the original Note has been dispensed of, and I only have access to
a digital copy of the Note. See Exhibit L.” (Han Decl., ¶ 15.) However,
it does not appear that Plaintiff has provided a separate proposed order to accept the copy in lieu of the original. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for
default judgment without prejudice. The Court will discuss with Plaintiff a
schedule for resubmission of the default judgment package.
