And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's request for a default judgment. The plaintiff, Woori America Bank, is seeking a judgment of $46,110.24 against the defendants, Darian Foods Inc. and Hwa Ok Yang. However, the court has identified several defects with the submitted default judgment package. First, the plaintiff should not have checked Item 1(e)(1) of the proposed judgment. Second, the plaintiff seeks interest at rates that may be in excess of the usury limitations of the California Constitution, but has not provided proof of exemption. Third, it is unclear how the plaintiff arrived at the interest rates of 10.80 and 11.06. Fourth, the plaintiff has not provided a separate proposed order to accept the digital copy of the promissory note in lieu of the original. Based on these defects, the court has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment without prejudice. The court will discuss with the plaintiff a schedule for resubmitting the default judgment package.
