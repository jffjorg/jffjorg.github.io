And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Teresa A. Beaudet, has disclosed that she and her husband purchased a pickup truck 24 years ago, which developed electrical problems and was eventually returned and refunded by the manufacturer and dealer. She does not believe that this experience will bias her in favor of or against either party in the case. However, if any new parties are added to the case, they have 14 calendar days to file and serve a verified Statement of Disqualification. The hearing on the Case Management Conference will be continued to December 9, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file a Statement. The Plaintiff, RODRICK WEST, is ordered to give notice of this Disclosure to any new parties and to file proof of service with the court.
