And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Beaudet discloses that she and her husband purchased a pickup truck 24 years ago, which developed electrical problems. Despite multiple trips to the dealer, the manufacturer and dealer eventually agreed to take the truck back and refund the purchase price. Judge Beaudet does not believe this experience will bias her in the current case, but if either party believes otherwise, they may file a verified statement of disqualification within a certain timeframe. The hearing on the Case Management Conference has been continued to December 9, 2024, unless both parties waive their right to file such a statement.
