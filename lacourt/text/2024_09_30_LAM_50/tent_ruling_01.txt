  Case Number:  21STCV27051    Hearing Date:   September 30, 2024    Dept:  50 There will be no tentative and proposed statement of decision yet because the Court has a couple of questions for the parties to address: The Court asks the parties to consider whether the UCC applies to the issue raised by the Defendants as to the allegedly nonconforming goods. If so, how does the UCC apply to the circumstances of this case. Also, Defendants have raised the issue of "offset." Is "offset" subject to or subsumed by the provisions of the UCC? How much are Defendants claiming for offset?
