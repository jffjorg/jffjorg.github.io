And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Michael Severo, Jr. and Michelle Severo, alleged that the defendants, including The Elite Group Property Inspection Service, Todd Smith, and others, engaged in breach of statutory duty, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, negligence, intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and constructive fraud. The defendants argued that the plaintiff's claims for punitive damages were insufficient and that the plaintiff's pleadings were conclusory and devoid of factual assertions. The judge ruled that the plaintiff's allegations could show that the defendants engaged in despicable conduct with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others, and that the plaintiff's claims for punitive damages were sufficient to survive a motion to strike. The judge also noted that the ultimate facts showing an entitlement to punitive damages must be pled by the plaintiff, and that conclusory allegations are insufficient to support a conclusion that parties acted with oppression, fraud, or malice.
