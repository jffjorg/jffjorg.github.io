And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories (Set Two). The Plaintiff, Christopher Rascon, alleged racial discrimination, racial harassment, age discrimination, age harassment, retaliation, and failure to prevent by the County of Los Angeles. The motion was filed on May 30, 2024, and the Judge reviewed the case based on the information presented before the hearing date.

The Judge found that the Defendant's objections were reasonable and that the Plaintiff failed to attempt a good faith informal resolution. The Judge also accepted the Defendant's explanation that the "permanent" qualifier in their responses was intended to clarify that the response refers only to individuals who were permanently assigned to a 40-hour position.

As a result, the Judge denied the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses and declined to award sanctions at this time.
