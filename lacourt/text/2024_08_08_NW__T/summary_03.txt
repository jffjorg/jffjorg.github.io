Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the case, finding that the plaintiffs failed to meet their initial burden of proof to show that the forum selection clause is unenforceable. The forum selection clause, which is contained in the Uniform Terms of Service (UTOS), requires that any disputes be filed in the Superior Court of Maricopa County, Arizona, or the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. The judge found that the plaintiffs had an opportunity to read the UTOS and therefore had notice of the forum selection clause, and that the clause is enforceable. The judge also found that the plaintiffs' lack of notice argument was unpersuasive, and that the defendant's evidence showing that the plaintiffs had an opportunity to read the UTOS was persuasive. The judge therefore granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the case, and denied the plaintiffs' motion to reclassify the case to limited jurisdiction or small claims court. The judge also denied the defendant's demurrer and motion to strike.
