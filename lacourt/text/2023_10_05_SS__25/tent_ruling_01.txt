ANALYSIS
 
I.          Motion
for Summary Judgment 
A.        Legal Standard 
The function of a motion for
summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an
opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to
enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25
Cal.4th 826, 843.
CCP Section 437c(c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all
the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the
evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there
is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” 
Adler v. Manor Healthcare
Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.  “The function of the pleadings in a motion
for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the
affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of
fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI
Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-382.
 
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial
burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to
establish a defense. (CCP § 437c(p)(2); Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.
Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing
summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that
party.”  Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.
 
Once the defendant has met that
burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one
or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense.  
To establish a triable issue of material fact, the party
opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive evidence. Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th
151, 166.
 
1.                 
First Cause of Action and Second Cause of Action 
 
“To establish a cause of action
for breach of contract, the plaintiff must plead and prove (1) the existence of
the contract, (2) the plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
the defendant’s breach, and (4) resulting damages to the plaintiff.
[Citation.]” Maxwell v. Dolezal (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 93, 97-98. The
elements of a common count cause of action are “(1) a statement of indebtedness
in a certain sum, (2) the consideration, i.e., goods sold, work done, etc., and
(3) nonpayment. [Citation.]” Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Zerin (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th
445, 460. 
 
Here, Plaintiff submits evidence
of the Motor Vehicle Lease Agreement entered into by Defendants for use of a
2018 Mercedes-Benz CLA250C on November 17, 2017. (Mot. Undisputed Material
Facts “UMF” No. 1, Ex. 1.) Under the agreement, Defendants were required to
make 36 base monthly payments of $385.89 plus applicable taxes on November 10, 2017,
and monthly thereafter on the tenth day of each month until the maturity date
on November 10, 2020. (UMF No. 2.) Defendants agreed to “keep the vehicle and
lease from all liens… default if they “fail to make any payment when due… if
the vehicle is destroyed abandoned, stolen or damaged beyond repair.” (UMF Nos.
3-5.) Defendants’ Answers admit the allegations regarding the lease agreement
raised in the complaint. (Mot., Ex. 3, ¶ 23, Ex. 4, ¶ 23.) Plaintiff received the lease by assignment from
Keyes European, upon which the Certificate of Title shows that Plaintiff and Defendants
are listed as the registered owners of the vehicle. (UMF No. 7, Ex. 5.)
Plaintiff did not receive Defendants required monthly lease payment due on or
after April 20, 2020. (UMF No. 8, Azubogu Decl., ¶19, Ex. 4.) 
 
            On September 13, 2022, the vehicle was sold through the
Manheim Southern California auto auction for the amount of $10,500.00. (UMF No.
23, Ex. 10.) The vehicle’s condition was graded 1 out of 5 and the estimated
cost to repair the vehicle would be $8,908.20. (UMF No. 24-25, Azobogu Decl ¶28.)
The vehicle’s average trade-in value in September 2022 was $22,350.00 per the
J.D. Power Official Used Car Guide. (UMF No. 26, Ex. 13.) Plaintiff submits
evidence that Defendants owed the sum of $26,558.52 before the vehicle’s sale.
(UMF No. 27, Ex. 14.) “Plaintiff incurred various charges for the recovery and
sale of the Vehicle as follows: inspection fees of $12.00; seller fees of
$35.00; and an on-site facilitation fee of 45.00, totaling $92.00.” (UMF No. 28.)

 
On February 1, 2022, Plaintiff
received a payment of $400.00, which was deduced from Defendants’ account
balance. (UMF No. 29, Azubogu Decl., ¶26.) On February 8, 2023, Plaintiff
received a payment of $394.60, which was also deduced from Defendants’ account
balance. (UMF No. 30, Azubogu Decl., ¶26.) Plaintiff states that Defendants’
remaining account balance is $14,388.42. (UMF No. 31, Azubogu Decl., ¶33.)
Plaintiff asserts that it “has performed all of the conditions, covenants, and
promises required under the terms of the lease.” (UMF No. 35, Azubogu Decl.,
¶18.) Plaintiff demanded payment from Defendants, but they refused to tender
payment. (UMF No. 36, Azubogu Decl., ¶33.) Plaintiff also seeks to recover its
reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. (UMF No. 37, Azubogu Decl., ¶34.) 
 
Plaintiff has presented sufficient
evidence to carry its initial burden of proof as to its claims for breach of
contract and common counts against Defendants. Plaintiff has demonstrated the
existence of the motor vehicle lease agreement between itself and Defendants,
Plaintiff’s performance under the terms of the lease, Defendants’ default, and
Plaintiff’s resulting damages. The burden now shifts to Defendants to
demonstrate that a triable issue of material fact exists as to Plaintiff’s
claims. Because the motion is unopposed, Defendants have failed to demonstrate
the existence of any triable issue of material fact.
 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment, or in
the Alternative, Summary Adjudication, is GRANTED.   
 
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
            For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary
Judgment or in the Alternative, Summary Adjudication is GRANTED. 
 
            Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
