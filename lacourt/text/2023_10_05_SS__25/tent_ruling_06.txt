a complaint against David S. Peterson, Lori N Peterson (collectively
“Defendants”), and Does 1-50 for (1) breach of contract and against Defendant

Defendants

claims and demands on the bond. Defendants failed to indemnify and hold
Plaintiff harmless from any loss or liability as required under the Indemnity
Agreement. Plaintiff incurred damages in the total amount of $15,140.00. 
 
On July

Summary Judgment.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Motion
for Summary Judgment 
A.        Legal Standard 
The function of a motion for
summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an
opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to
enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25
Cal.4th 826, 843. CCP Section 437c(c) “requires the trial judge to
grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences
reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences
or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and
that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Adler
v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.  “The function of the pleadings in a motion
for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the
affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of
fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI
Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-382.
 
As
to each claim as framed by the complaint, the defendant moving for summary
judgment must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to negate
an essential element, or to establish a defense. CCP § 437c(p)(2); Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520. Courts “liberally construe the evidence in
support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning
the evidence in favor of that party.” Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.
 
Once
the defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show
that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of
action or a defense.  
To establish a
triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce
substantial responsive evidence. Sangster
v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.
 
Parties may
expressly contract for a duty to indemnify. See Valley Crest Landscape
Development, Inc. v. Mission Pools of Escondido, Inc. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th
468, 479.  “The standard elements of a claim for breach of contract
are: ‘(1) the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) damage to plaintiff
therefrom.’” Wall Street Network, Ltd. v. New York Times Co. (2008) 164
Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178.
 
Here, Plaintiff submits
the Indemnity Agreement signed by Defendants. (Ex. A, B.)  On November 13, 2018, Defendants executed a
Bond Application/Indemnity Agreement (“Indemnity Agreement”) with Plaintiff.
(Mot., Undisputed Material Facts “UMF” No. 1, Ex. A.) Plaintiff issued the
BMC-84 Freight Broker Bond No. 1001127216 for ASAP Easy Shipping LLC as
principal and the Federal Motor Carrier Administration as obligee. (UMF. No. 2.)
Pursuant to the Indemnity Agreement, Defendants agreed “to indemnify Surety
against all losses, liabilities, costs, damages, attorneys’ and consultants’
fees and expenses… an itemized statement of payments made by Surety shall be
prima facie evidence of the obligation of undersigned die to Surety.” (Id.
at No. 3, Baciocco Decl., ¶ 6, 8.) Plaintiff received
multiple claims on the Bond and determined liability under the Bond was clear
and issued 15 payments from the Bond totaling $15,140.00. (Id. at No.
4-5. Baciocco Decl., ¶ 10.) Plaintiff submits evidence
of the Loss, Recovery, Reserve and Transaction Report, which contains
information regarding the losses and expenses paid in connection with claims. (Baciocco Decl., ¶ 10,
Ex. 5.) 
 
On March 2,
2020, Plaintiff sent Defendants a Notice of Reimbursement demanding
reimbursement of the principal loss amount of $15,140.00 (UMF No. 6, Baciocco Decl., ¶ 11,
Ex. 3.) On January 25, 2021, Plaintiff sent a letter to David S. Peterson
regarding contention that he did not sign the Indemnity Agreement (Id.
at No. 7, Baciocco Decl., ¶ 12, Ex. 3.) Plaintiff memorialized
the telephone conversation with David S. Peterson who stated that he signed the
Indemnity Agreement but refused to reimburse the surety. (Id. at No. 8, Baciocco Decl., ¶ 13.) 
 
Plaintiff has incurred a
net loss of $15,140.00 plus interest, attorney’s fees, and costs because of
Plaintiff’s issuance of the Bond. (UMF No. 9, Baciocco Decl., ¶
14-15.)  Plaintiff states the interest accruing on the
$15,140.00 claim payment total $5,940.48 through the October 5 hearing date and
submits evidence showing interest calculation for each of Plaintiff’s bond
loss. (Id. at No. 10, Ex. 6.) 
 
This evidence supports
Plaintiff’s initial burden of proof as to its claims for breach of contract
against Defendants. Plaintiff has demonstrated the existence of an Indemnity
Agreement between itself and Defendants, Plaintiff’s performance, Defendants’
breach, and Plaintiff’s resulting damages. The burden now shifts to Defendants
to demonstrate that a triable issue of material fact exists as to Plaintiff’s
claims. As Defendants have not opposed the instant Motion, Defendants have
failed to demonstrate the existence of any triable issue of material fact. The court awards
Plaintiffs the requested amount of $15,140.00 under the Indemnity Agreement and
$5,940.48 in pre-judgment interest as of October 5, 2023, or interest at the
rate of 10% per annum, for a total award of $21,080.48.   
 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s Motion
for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. 

 
III.       Conclusion 
            
            For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary
Judgment is GRANTED.
 
            Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
