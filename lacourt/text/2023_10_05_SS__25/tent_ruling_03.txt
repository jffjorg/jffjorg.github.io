allowable.  The Court notes that there is a discrepancy of costs at Pet., ¶ 13(b) and in the summary Pet., ¶ 16(d)., which
lists the expenses as $293.20 and $279.20, respectively.  The Court’s approval of Petitioner’s Petition
is based on the costs provided in the summary Pet., ¶ 16(d)., as this amount is
