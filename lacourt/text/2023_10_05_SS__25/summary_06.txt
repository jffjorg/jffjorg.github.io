And here is the English text summary:

The Judge issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment filed by the Plaintiff, American Contractors Indemnity Company, against the Defendants, David S. Peterson, Lori N. Peterson, Ryan Beck, and Does 1-50. The Plaintiff filed a complaint against the Defendants on August 17, 2022, alleging breach of contract and seeking damages in the amount of $15,140.00.

The Plaintiff argues that the Defendants failed to indemnify and hold the Plaintiff harmless as required under the Indemnity Agreement, and that the Plaintiff has incurred damages as a result of the Defendants' breach. The Plaintiff submits evidence of the Indemnity Agreement, the Bond, and the losses and expenses paid in connection with claims.

The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has met its initial burden of proof and that the burden now shifts to the Defendants to demonstrate that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the Plaintiff's claims. As the Defendants have not opposed the motion, the Judge grants the Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and awards the Plaintiff the requested amount of $15,140.00 under the Indemnity Agreement and $5,940.48 in pre-judgment interest as of October 5, 2023, or interest at the rate of 10% per annum.
