And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge rules that the motions to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set One, are granted. The plaintiff, Charles Yang, failed to respond to the defendant's initial discovery requests, despite being served with the requests and receiving correspondence and phone calls from the defendant. The defendant, Trevor Lords, filed the motions on July 31, 2023, and the plaintiff did not file an opposition. The judge finds that the meet and confer requirement was met and that the defendant properly filed separate statements. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's objections to the discovery requests are without merit and that the plaintiff has not provided a valid reason for the objections. The judge orders the plaintiff to provide further verified responses to the requests without objection within 20 days. The judge also awards sanctions to the defendant in the amount of $870.00, consisting of $750.00 in attorney fees and $120.00 in motion filing fees, to be paid within 30 days.
