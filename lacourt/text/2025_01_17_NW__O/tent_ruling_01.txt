HISTORY
On May 7, 2024,
Plaintiff filed his Complaint, alleging (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act -
Breach of Express Warranty; (2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act - Breach of

 On January 6, 2025, Defendant filed its
Opposition. 
On January

III.        
LEGAL STANDARD
A.            
Request for Production of Documents 
In responding to a request for
production of documents, a party must provide one of the following: (1) a
legally adequate statement of compliance; (2) a statement of inability to
comply; or (3) an objection to the particular demand. (See Code Civ.
Proc. § 2031.210(a).)[1] If any objections are made,
they must: (1) “[i]dentify with particularity any document …
falling within any category of item in the demand to which an objection is
being made”; and (2) “[s]et forth clearly the extent of, and the specific
ground for, the objection.”¿(Id. at § 2031.240(b).) A statement that
the responding party is unable to comply with a particular demand “shall affirm
that a diligent search and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to
comply with that demand”; “shall also specify whether the inability to comply
is because the particular item or category has never existed, has been
destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no
longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding party”; 
and “shall set forth the name and address of any natural person or organization
known or believed by that party to have possession, custody, or control of that
item or category of item.” (Id. at § 2031.230.) 
A party who
believes a responding party has served (1) an incomplete statement of
compliance, (2) an inadequate, incomplete, or evasive statement of compliance,
or (3) an unmeritorious objection can move for an order compelling further
responses but must “set forth specific acts showing good cause justifying the
discovery sought by the demand.” (See id. at §§
2031.310(a)-(b)(1).) 
IV.         
MEET AND CONFER
Before bringing a motion to compel further responses to any
discovery request, the moving party is required to make efforts to meet and
confer in good faith and must submit a declaration attesting to those efforts.
(See Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2031.310(b)(2), 2030.300(b)(1), and 2033.290(b)(1).)
“A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing
a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue
presented by the motion.” (Id. at § 2016.040.) However, a discovery
motion should not be denied automatically based upon the reason that the moving
parties failed to meet and confer in good faith. (See Obregon v.
Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 434.) 
Plaintiff’s counsel filed a declaration attesting to Plaintiff’s
meet and confer efforts, which consisted of two letters, the last of which was
sent on August 5, 2024. (See Declaration of Roy Enav filed August 13,
2024, ¶¶ 18-20, 23-34, Exs. 5-8.) The Court does not find Plaintiff has
fulfilled his meet and confer obligations. First, the Court does not generally consider
an exchange of letters a sufficient attempt to avoid this Court’s intervention.
Second, in postponing the hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion and issuing its
Addendum, the Court specifically stated “[c]ounsel are ordered to meet and
confer regarding the substance of the pending Motion to Compel Further with the
Addendum in mind BEFORE either party files any additional briefing in
connection with the Motion to Compel Further.” (Minute Order dated November 7,
2024.) 
Plaintiff does not address the Court’s November 7, 2024, Minute
Order in its Reply and does not appear to have made any additional efforts to
meet and confer with Defendant as required by the same, issued between the
filing of Plaintiff’s Motion and the upcoming hearing on the matter. For its
part, Defendant’s Opposition makes no mention of any such efforts either. For
that reason alone, the Court denies Plaintiff’s Motion. 
Plaintiff’s Motion is also denied for failing to address
Defendant’s claims that it was not served with the Motion. Defendant’s counsel
declares “[o]n October 23, 2024, Ford sent Plaintiffs a meet and confer letter
demanding Plaintiff withdraw the present Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, which noted that the motion is
premature and that it was never served upon Ford’s counsel.  Plaintiff’s counsel never responded to this
letter.” (Declaration of Colin Cronin filed January 6, 2025, ¶ 7, Ex. 7.) As
was the case with the Court’s issuance of its Addendum, Plaintiff does not
address Defendant’s claims or offer any evidence to refute them, such as a copy
of the email purporting to properly serve Defendant with the Motion. (See Reply.)

V.            
CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendant’s Further
Responses to his RFPs.  
          IT
IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:      January 17, 2025
