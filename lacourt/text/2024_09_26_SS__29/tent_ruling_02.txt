 Case Number:  21STCV05456    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2024    Dept:  29 Castellanos v. City of Los Angeles
21STCV05456
Demurrer filed by Defendant City of Los Angeles
Tentative
The demurrer is overruled.
Background
On February 10, 2021, Douglas Castellanos and
Juian Holloman (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against City of
Los Angeles and Does 1 through 20 asserting causes of action for general negligence
and premises liability arising out of a motor vehicle accident occurring on
February 10, 2019, at or near the intersection of 38th Street and Santa Fe
Avenue in Vernon, California. 
On October 4, 2022, Plaintiffs amended the
complaint to correct the name of the defendant. 
According to the amendment, the incorrect name was “City of Los Angeles”
and the correct name is “City of Vernon.”
On April 19, 2023, however, Plaintiffs
amended the complaint to name City of Los Angeles as Doe 2.
On October 5, 2023, default was entered against
City of Los Angeles (“Defendant”).  The
default was set aside on July 29, 2024.
On April 15, 2024, City of Vernon filed an answer.
On August 27,
2024, Defendant filed this demurrer. No opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10 provides:
“The party against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been
filed may object, by demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430.30, to the
pleading on any one or more of the following grounds:
(a) The court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the
cause of action alleged in the pleading.
(b) The person who filed the pleading does not have the
legal capacity to sue.
(c) There is another action pending between the same
parties on the same cause of action.
(d) There is a defect or misjoinder of parties.
(e) The pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.
(f) The pleading is uncertain. As used in this subdivision,
“uncertain” includes ambiguous and unintelligible.
(g) In an action founded upon a contract, it cannot be
ascertained from the pleading whether the contract is written, is oral, or is
implied by conduct.
(h) No certificate was filed as required by Section 411.35.”
A
general demurrer for sufficiency under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10,
subdivision (e), tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or
law.  We also consider matters which may
be judicially noticed.”  (Centinela
Freeman Emergency Medical Associates v. Health Net of California (2016) 1
Cal.5th 994, 1010; Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; accord Yvanova
v. New Century Mortgage Corp. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 919, 924; Marina Pacific
Hotel and Suites v. Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th
96, 104.)  All reasonable inferences must
be drawn in favor of the pleading.  (Schifando
v. City of Los Angeles (2003) 31 Cal.4th 1074, 1081; Marina Pacific
Hotel and Suites, supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at p. 104.)  Even “improbable” facts alleged in the
pleading must be accepted as true.  (Marina
Pacific Hotel and Suites, supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at pp. 104-105.)
Courts must “liberally construe the pleading” and “give the
complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in
context.”  (Id. at p. 105.)
A demurrer can be sustained only when it
disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp.
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev.
Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)
Leave to amend should be granted when “there is a
reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.”  (Centinela Freeman, supra, 1 Cal.5th
at p. 1010; Blank, supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 318; Shaeffer v. Califia
Farms (2020) 44 Cal.App.5th 1125, 1145.)
Meet and Confer Requirement
Before filing a demurrer, the parties must meet and
confer.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41,
subd. (a).) 
That requirement is satisfied here. 
(Attarian Decl., ¶ 2.)
Discussion
Defendant demurs to the complaint on the ground that the
location of the accident, as alleged in the complaint, is located within the City
of Vernon, not the City of Los Angeles. 
 
The complaint, however, alleges that Defendant (among
other things) maintained the intersection in which the accident occurred.  (Complaint, at p. 4.)  The Court must accept that allegation as true,
and that allegation is sufficient to state a cause of action for premises
liability and negligence.  The Court, at
this stage of the proceedings, is not making any determination as to whether
the allegations in the complaint are true.
 
The Court also notes that in ruling on a demurrer, it may
consider only the allegations of the complaint and judicially noticeable
facts.  Defendant does not seek judicial
notice of the exhibits attached to counsel’s declaration (a page from the
Thomas Guide and a witness declaration). 

 
The demurrer is overruled.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court OVERRULES the demurrer of Defendant
City of Los Angeles.
 
Moving Party is to give notice.
