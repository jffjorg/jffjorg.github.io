And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the City's motion to continue trial, but denies its request to advance the hearing date on its summary judgment motion. The City filed a motion for summary judgment and set the hearing date for June 4, 2025, but the trial is currently set for December 13, 2024. The judge finds that good cause has been shown to continue trial, as the City has a right to have its timely filed summary judgment motion heard before trial. However, the judge does not find good cause to advance the hearing date. The trial is continued to a date on or after July 7, 2025, and the final status conference and all deadlines are reset based on the new trial date.
