And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on two motions: a motion to be relieved as counsel and a motion to continue trial. The motion to be relieved as counsel is continued for approximately 30 days to allow the counsel to file and serve a new order that complies with the court's rules. The motion to continue trial is granted due to good cause, specifically the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The trial date is advanced and continued to a date on or after April 11, 2025. The final status conference and all deadlines are reset based on the new trial date.
