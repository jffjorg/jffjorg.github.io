Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284, subd. (b).) An attorney is permitted to
withdraw where conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable
to continue the representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct
3-700(C)(1).) “The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to
withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel contends
there has been a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. Counsel states
that Plaintiff’s address has been confirmed within the past 30 days by
telephone and conversation. Proof of service shows proper and timely service on
Plaintiff by mail as well as on Defendants Selma Vine Hollywood, LLC, Camden
Development, Inc., Ashley Leon, and Robert Altamirano. All upcoming hearings
and trial dates have been included in the declaration and proposed order.
All substantive
and procedural requirements are satisfied. 
The Court finds Counsel has shown good cause to be relieved as counsel
of record for Plaintiff.
Accordingly, the
motion is GRANTED.
Conclusion
 
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is GRANTED. The order is effective
upon filing with the Court a proof of service showing service of the signed
order (not just the minute order) on the clients.
