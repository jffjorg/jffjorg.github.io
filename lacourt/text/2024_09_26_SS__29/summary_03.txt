And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to vacate the order granting the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff filed the motion on May 9, 2024, seeking to vacate the order granted on January 24, 2024. However, the court found that the motion was incomplete and procedurally deficient because it was not accompanied by a declaration of counsel, supporting evidence, or a supporting memorandum. The court noted that the statute (Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b)) requires that a request for discretionary relief be made within a reasonable time, in this case, six months after entry of judgment. The court also noted that the plaintiff did not show any basis for the relief requested. Therefore, the court denied the motion to vacate.
