And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Los Angeles has filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the plaintiff's complaint does not state a cause of action against the City. The City claims that the plaintiff's claim with the City did not provide adequate notice of the location of the alleged defect in the sidewalk, and that the plaintiff has now shifted her allegations regarding the location of the defect in a way that is not fairly reflected in the claim.

The judge agrees with the City's arguments, finding that the plaintiff's claim with the City did not provide adequate notice of the location of the alleged defect, and that the plaintiff's allegations regarding the location of the defect in the first amended complaint are not fairly reflected in the claim submitted to the City. The judge also rejects the plaintiff's argument that the City has waived this argument by delay.

As a result, the judge grants the City's motion for judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff cannot amend her complaint to cure the pleading defect. The City is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
