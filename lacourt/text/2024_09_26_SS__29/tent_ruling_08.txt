23STCV11884
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s
Counsel Arnoldo Casillas
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On May 25, 2023,
Veronica Gomez, individually and as successor of interest for the Estate of
Mario Gallegos (“Plaintiff”), filed the complaint in this action against County
of Los Angeles (“Defendant”), asserting causes of action for assault &
battery, wrongful death, and civil rights violations under Civil Code section
52.1, all arising from the death of Mario Gallegos at the hands of an inmate at
Los Angeles County Men’s Central Jail on May 9, 2022. 
 
On August 28,
2024, Arnoldo Casillas (“Counsel”) filed this
motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. No opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284, subd. (b).) An attorney is permitted to
withdraw where conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable
to continue the representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct
3-700(C)(1).) “The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to
withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel timely
served Plaintiff with the Motion, Declaration, and Order as confirmed within
the past 30 days by conversation. Counsel states that there has been a
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship based on differing opinions on
how to proceed. Counsel has provided Plaintiff with all investigative documents
to date.
The Court finds
Counsel has shown good cause for being relieved based on the breakdown of the
attorney-client relationship.
Accordingly, the
motion is GRANTED.
Conclusion
 
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is GRANTED. The order is
effective upon filing with the Court a proof of service showing service of the
signed order (not just the minute order) on the clients.
