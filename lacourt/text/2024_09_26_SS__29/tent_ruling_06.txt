Background
On December 14,

Auzie Houchins (“Plaintiff”), filed a complaint City of Los Angeles (“City”),
Tammy Houchins, Doe Officers 1 through 25, and Does 26 through 100.  In the complaint, Plaintiff asserts causes of
action for (1) negligence, (2) dangerous condition of government property,
(3) wrongful death, (4) trespass, (5) public nuisance, (6) private nuisance,
(7) violation of the Bane Civil Rights Act, (8) survival action, and (9)
declaratory relief, all arising out of an incident in which, Plaintiff alleges,
the Los Angeles Police Department set off illegal fireworks on June 30, 2021, destroying
Auzie Houchins’ home and causing injuries to him. (Complaint, ¶ 1.)
On March 3,
2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) asserting causes of
action for (1) negligence, (2) dangerous condition of government property, (3)
wrongful death, (4) public nuisance, (5) private nuisance, (6) survival action,
and (7) declaratory relief. 
On April 20,
2023, City filed an answer. 
On August 28,
2024, City filed a motion for summary judgment. 
The hearing is scheduled for June 4, 2025.
On August 28,
2024, City also filed this motion to continue trial. No opposition has been
filed.
The current
trial date is December 13, 2024.
Legal
Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 128,
subdivision (a)(8), provides that the court has the power to amend and control
its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice. “The
power to determine when a continuance should be granted is within the
discretion of the trial court.” (Color-Vue, Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44
Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide latitude in the matter of
calendar control including the granting or denying of continuances.” (Park
Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.)  
“To ensure the prompt disposition of civil
cases, the dates assigned for trial are firm. 
All parties and their counsel must regard the date set for trial as
certain.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(a).)
“Although continuances of trials are
disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own
merits.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(c).)  “The court may grant a
continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the
continuance.”  (Ibid.)  Circumstances that may support a finding of
good cause include:  
“(1) The
unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness because of death, illness,
or other excusable circumstances;  
(2) The
unavailability of a party because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(3) The
unavailability of trial counsel because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(4) The
substitution of trial counsel, but only where there is an affirmative showing
that the substitution is required in the interests of justice;  
(5) The addition
of a new party if: (A) The new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to
conduct discovery and prepare for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had
a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard
to the new party's involvement in the case; 

(6) A party's
excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material
evidence despite diligent efforts; or  
(7) A
significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case as a result of which
the case is not ready for trial.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c).)  
“In ruling on a motion or application for
continuance, the court must consider all the facts and circumstances that are
relevant to the determination.”  (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).)  California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d) sets forth a non-exhaustive list of factors that
the court may consider:  
“(1) The
proximity of the trial date;  
(2) Whether
there was any previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to
any party;  
(3) The length
of the continuance requested;  
(4) The
availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the
motion or application for a continuance; 

(5) The
prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;

(6) If the case
is entitled to a preferential trial setting, the reasons for that status and
whether the need for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; 
(7) The court's
calendar and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending trials; 
(8) Whether
trial counsel is engaged in another trial; 

(9) Whether all
parties have stipulated to a continuance; 

(10) Whether the
interests of justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the
matter, or by imposing conditions on the continuance; and  
(11) Any other
fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or
application.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).) 
“A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment
motion filed within the time limits of section 437c.” (Sentry Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529; accord Cole v. Superior
Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.)
Discussion
City filed a motion for summary judgment and
set the hearing on the earliest available date, which was June 4, 2025.  (Lundh Decl., ¶ 6.)  Trial is currently set for December 13, 2024.  City seeks a continuance of trial and/or an
advancement of the hearing date on its summary judgment motion. 
No opposition has been filed.
The Court finds that good cause has been
shown to continue trial.  City has a
right to have its timely filed summary judgment motion heard before trial.
The Court finds that good cause has not been
shown to advance the hearing date.  
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS the request to continue
trial and DENIES the request to advance the hearing date.
The trial is continued to a date on or after
July 7, 2025.  The Final Status
Conference and all deadlines are reset based on the new trial date.
Moving Party is ordered to give notice.
