The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the City of Los Angeles (Defendant) in the case of Castellanos v. City of Los Angeles (Case Number 21STCV05456). The demurrer was filed on the grounds that the location of the motor vehicle accident, as alleged in the complaint, is located within the City of Vernon, not the City of Los Angeles. The Court has reviewed the allegations in the complaint and has determined that they are sufficient to state a cause of action for premises liability and negligence. The Court has also considered the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10 and has determined that the demurrer is overruled. The Court has given the parties notice of its ruling and has ordered the moving party to give notice.
