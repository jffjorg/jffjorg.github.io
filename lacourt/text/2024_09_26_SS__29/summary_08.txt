The judge found that Counsel has shown good cause for being relieved based on the breakdown of the attorney-client relationship, which was caused by differing opinions on how to proceed. The judge noted that Counsel has provided the Plaintiff with all investigative documents to date. Therefore, the motion is granted, and the order is effective upon filing with the Court a proof of service showing service of the signed order on the client.
