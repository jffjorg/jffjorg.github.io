Legal
Standard & Discussion
 
CCP § 664.6, provides a summary
procedure that enables judges to enforce a settlement agreement by entering a
judgment pursuant to the terms of the parties’ settlement.  In particular, the statute provides:
 
(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.  If requested by the parties, the court may
retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.
 
(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed by a
party if it is signed by any of the following:
 
(1) The party.
(2) An attorney who represents the party.
(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is authorized
in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer's behalf.
 
CCP §
664.6(a)-(b) (emphasis added).
 
III.           
Discussion
 
A. Retention of Jurisdiction
 
“‘[V]oluntary dismissal of an
action or special proceeding terminates the court’s jurisdiction over the
matter.’  (Conservatorship of Martha
P. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 857, 867) [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 142.) ‘If requested
by the parties,’ however, ‘the [trial] court may retain jurisdiction over
the parties to enforce [a] settlement until performance in full of the terms of
the settlement.’ (§ 664.6, italics added.)” 
(Mesa RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles (2019) 33
Cal.App.5th 913, 917.)  “‘Because of its
summary nature, strict compliance with the requirements of section 664.6 is
prerequisite to invoking the power of the court to impose a settlement
agreement.’”  (Ibid. (quoting Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 30, 37).)
 
“A request for the trial court to
retain jurisdiction under section 664.6 ‘must conform to the same three
requirements which the Legislature and the courts have deemed necessary for
section 664.6 enforcement of the settlement itself: the request must be made
(1) during the pendency of the case, not after the case has been dismissed in
its entirety, (2) by the parties themselves, and (3) either in a writing signed
by the parties or orally before the court.’” 
(Ibid. (quoting Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th
429, 440).)  “The ‘request must be
express, not implied from other language, and it must be clear and
unambiguous.’” (Ibid. (quoting Wackeen, supra, 97 Cal.App.4th at
440).)
 
Here, the parties signed a
Stipulation for Entry of Judgment in the Event of Default (“Stipulation”)
containing the parties’ agreement for the Court to retain jurisdiction pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure §664.6 to enforce the terms of the stipulation and
enter judgment in the event of default.  (12-5-22
Stipulation ¶ 10.)  Prior to the
dismissal of this action, the Stipulation was signed by the parties and
submitted to the Court.  (Ibid. at
p. 4.)  On December 6, 2022, the Court
dismissed the entire case without prejudice pursuant to the Stipulation and
expressly stated that it “RETAINS JURISDICTION OF THIS CASE IN ACCORDANCE WITH
AND PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 664.6.”  (12-6-22 Order.)
 
The Court finds that the
Stipulation complies with § 664.6 requirements and the Court has retained
jurisdiction to enter judgment pursuant to the parties’ Stipulation in this
action.
 
B. Entry of Judgment
 
The Stipulation Agreement filed on December
5, 2022, provides that Plaintiff and Defendant agreed to dismiss the action on
the premise that Defendant would compensate Plaintiff for the settlement amount
of $8,798.08.  (12-5-22 Stipulation ¶ 4.)  Pursuant to the Stipulation, Defendant’s
insurance carrier Alliance United Insurance Company would make a payment of $4,298.08
within thirty (30) days of Defendant’s execution of the agreement.  (Ibid. at ¶ 2(i).)  Defendant would pay the remaining balance of
$4,500 with $100 monthly payments commencing on March 1, 2023, and continuing
on the first day of each month, until the balance is paid in full.  (Ibid. at ¶ 2(ii).)  Defendant would also be responsible for the
balance not paid by his insurance carrier. 
(Ibid. at ¶ 2(i).)  All
parties signed the Stipulation.  (Ibid.
at p. 4.)
 
The Stipulation also provides that Defendant
will have a fifteen (15) day grace period to make payments.  (Ibid. at ¶ 8.)  In the event Defendant fails to make
payments, Plaintiff will give written notice of default and Defendant will have
an additional ten (10) days to cure the default.  (Ibid.)  If Defendant does not cure the default,
“Plaintiff may immediately cause Judgment to be entered pursuant to the terms
set forth in this Stipulation for the full amount of the agreed upon judgement
as set forth in Paragraph 1 less any monies paid to date of the breach; and
shall also file a partial Satisfaction of Judgment for all sums previously paid
pursuant to this Stipulation.”  (Ibid.
at ¶ 6.)  If Defendant’s contact
information changes, he is responsible for providing written notice to
Plaintiff, otherwise Plaintiff will send the notice of default to the address
indicated in the Stipulation.  (Ibid.
at ¶ 8.)
 
On June 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
instant Motion alleging that Defendant breached the Stipulation.  (Mot. pp. 1-2.)
 
Plaintiff’s counsel, Susan M.
Benson, states that Defendant’s insurance carrier made a payment of $4,289.08.  (Benson Decl. ¶ 5.)  Defendant did not make any payments.  (Ibid.)  On April 13, 2023, Counsel sent a default
notice to Defendant to pay the remaining sum of $4,500.00.  (Ibid. at ¶ 6, Ex. 2.)  However, Defendant has not made any payments.  (Ibid. at ¶ 7.)  Thus, Plaintiff requests that the Court enter
judgment for Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $12,336.78 as
follows: principal amount of $16,108.21, less $4,298.08 in payments made by Defendant’s
insurance carrier, plus filing costs of $72, and lawsuit filing fee of $454.65.  (Ibid. at ¶ 8.)
 
The Court finds the Stipulation to be
valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Proc. § 664.6.  Plaintiff provides evidence that Defendant did
not make any monthly payments and did not respond to Plaintiff’s written notice
of default.  Thus, a valid
and signed stipulation agreement was breached and the Court retained
jurisdiction to enter judgment upon breach.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Set
Aside Dismissal and Enter Judgment is GRANTED. 
Dismissal entered on December 6, 2022, is vacated, and judgment is
entered for Plaintiff and against Defendant for $12,336.78 as follows:
principal amount of $11,810.13, $72.00 in motion filing fees, and $454.65 in
lawsuit filing fees.
 
IV.

Insurance Company’s Motion to Set Aside Dismissal and Enter Judgment is
