English text:

On January 12, 2021, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company filed an action for subrogation against Defendant Jose Oswaldo Garcia for an automobile collision. Plaintiff compensated an insured individual for claimed damages in the amount of $13,616.20 and filed the instant claim against Defendant for allegedly causing the damages. On August 20, 2021, Defendant filed an Answer to the Complaint. On November 3, 2022, the court was informed that the matter had settled and placed trial off calendar. On February 28, 2023, Plaintiff and Defendant signed a Stipulation for Dismissal with a Reservation of Jurisdiction to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment in the Event of Default. The Stipulation provided that Defendant would compensate Plaintiff for the settlement amount of $10,761.61, with $200 monthly payments commencing on February 15, 2023, and continuing until the balance is paid in full. On March 22, 2023, the court dismissed the entire case without prejudice pursuant to the Stipulation. On June 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Set Aside Dismissal and Enter Judgment, alleging that Defendant breached the Stipulation by failing to make payments. Plaintiff requests that the Court enter judgment for Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $4,872.10. The Court finds the Stipulation to be valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Proc. § 664.6. Plaintiff provides evidence that Defendant did not make any monthly payments and did not respond to Plaintiff’s written notice of default. Thus, a valid and signed stipulation agreement was breached and the Court retained jurisdiction to enter judgment upon breach. However, the Court continues the hearing on the Motion and orders Plaintiff to verify that defense counsel has been properly served with the moving papers at the correct address.
