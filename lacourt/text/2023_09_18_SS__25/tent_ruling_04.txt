 Case Number:  21STLC02852    Hearing Date:   September 18, 2023    Dept:  25 Eli’s Collision Repair of South Bay, Inc. v. Brown, et al. 21stlc02582ANALYSIS: I.                Background On April 12, 2021, Plaintiff Eli’s Collision Repair of South Bay, Inc., also known as Eli’s Collision Repair III, a California Corporation (“Plaintiff” or “Eli’s”) filed an action against Gannon Brown (“Brown”) and USAA Casualty Insurance Company, a Texas Corporation (“USAA”), (collectively “Defendants”) for (1) civil damages for theft, (2) conversion, (3) claim and delivery, (4) restitution (unjust enrichment), (5) breach of contract, (6) fraud (intentional misrepresentation), and (7) negligence. On December 8, 2021, the Court denied Defendant Brown’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons and ordered him to file and serve a responsive pleading within 20 days of the order.      (12-8-21 Minute Order.) On December 28, 2021, Defendant Brown filed a Demurrer to the first and third causes of action in Plaintiff’s Complaint.  The Court overruled Defendant Brown’s Demurrer.  (2-14-22 Minute Order.) On February 17, 2022, Defendant Brown filed an Answer to the Complaint and a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Eli’s.  On March 22, 2022, Brown filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint (“FACC”) against Eli’s for (1) violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, (2) breach of common law warranty, (3) promissory fraud, and (4) breach of contract. On June 24, 2022, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Eli’s filed a Demurrer to the First Amended Cross-Complaint’s first, third, and fourth causes of action.  On September 7, 2022, the Court sustained the Demurrer to the FACC’s first cause of action for violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act with 25 days’ leave to amend and continued the hearing on the Demurrer to the third and fourth causes of action.  (9-7-22 Minute Order.)  On October 3, 2022, Defendant/Cross-Complainant Brown filed a Second Amended Cross-Complaint (“SACC”).  On October 10, 2022, the Court overruled the Demurrer as moot following the filing of the SACC.  (10-10-22 Minute Order.) On December 14, 2022, Plaintiff/Cross Defendant Eli’s filed another Demurrer with Motion to Strike portions of the SACC.  On February 27, 2023, the Court sustained Eli’s Demurrer to the SACC’s first and third causes of action without leave to amend.  (2-27-23 Minute Order.)  The Court also granted Eli’s Motion to Strike portions of the SACC. On January 19, 2023, pursuant to Plaintiff’s oral request, the Court dismissed Defendant USAA without prejudice.  (1-19-23 Order of Dismissal.) On August 21 and 24, 2023, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Eli’s filed the two instant Motions: (1)   Motion to Compel Deposition of Gannon Brown and Production of Vehicle for Inspection and Order Imposing Monetary Sanctions of $3,633.80 (“MTC Deposition”);(2)   Motion to Compel Production of Vehicle for Inspection and Impose Monetary Sanctions of $5,016.30 (“MTC Production”). On September 1, 2023, the Court granted Eli’s Ex Parte Application for Order Continuing Trial (and All Related Dates), or in the Alternative, an Order Shortening Time for Hearing of Same.  (9-1-23 Minute Order.)  The Court ordered the trial continued to November 30, 2023, along with all related discovery and trial deadlines.  (Ibid.) On September 5, 2023, Defendant/Cross-Complainant Brown filed a single Opposition to both Motions.  No reply has been filed. Eli’s filed an Answer to the SACC on September 5, 2023. II.              Legal Standard & Discussion A.    Motion to Compel Deposition Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Eli’s moves to compel the attendance of Defendant/Cross-Complainant Brown at an oral deposition and the production of the subject 2017 Porsche 911 Carrera (“Porsche”) for physical and photographic inspection at the deposition.  (MTC Dep. p. 2.)  Eli’s also requests that the Court impose monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,633.80 against Brown and his counsel for their willful failure to appear at the deposition and produce the tangible item requested.  (Ibid.) Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.450(a) provides: “If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.” The motion shall “(1) set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice” and “(2) be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450(b)(2).) On July 20, 2023, Eli’s served Brown’s counsel with a Notice of Deposition and Demand for Inspection of Vehicle, setting the deposition and inspection for August 3, 2023, at 1:30 p.m.  (Thomas Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. 1.)  On July 21, 2023, Brown’s attorney served the following three objections to the Notice.  (Ibid. at, Ex. 2.)  Counsel objected on the basis that (1) the deposition was set after the discovery cut-off date, (2) the date of inspection was not at least 30 days after service of the Demand for Inspection, and (3) the notice failed to provide a reasonable place of inspection.  (Ibid.)  Eli’s argues that the “objections are specious and without any colorable legal justification” as the discovery cutoff date is August 29, 2023, and providing 30-day notice and location of inspection are not requirements for depositions.  (MTC Dep. p. 4.)  Eli’s adds that the attorneys for each party met and conferred telephonically in good faith regarding the motion and Defendant’s objections on August 16, 2023.  (Thomas Dec.)  However, the attorneys could not come to an agreement and Defendant Brown refuses to submit to a deposition or produce the Porsche for inspection.  (Ibid.) Eli’s argues that it has a right to depose Defendant and request inspection of tangible things pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.010 and has properly served a notice of deposition.  (MTC Dep. p. 5.)  The inspection was to take place at Eli’s in Inglewood and the deposition would take place in the conference room.  (Ibid.)  The location was selected due to its convenience to both parties, special lighting booths for visual and photographic inspection, and because it was the same location where Defendant Brown approved the color match for painting of the Porsche.  (Ibid.)  Eli’s has good cause for demanding production and inspection of the Porsche because it will produce evidence of the matching paint color for the purpose of trial.  (Ibid. at pp. 5-6.)  Moreover, Defendant’s objections are “without any factual or legal justification.”  (Ibid. at p. 6.) Despite earlier objections, Defendant Brown does not oppose the Motion.  (Oppos. p. 3.)  However, he expresses concerns that “Plaintiff would exploit the inspection of the vehicle as an opportunity to refuse to release the vehicle back to him, and instead claim that it had the right to retain possession pursuant to a mechanic’s lien.”  (Ibid. at p. 4.)  The concern arises from the demands made in the Complaint regarding possession of the vehicle.  (Ibid.)  Defense counsel has offered to produce the vehicle in a police or sheriff’s department parking lot, or other neutral outdoor location; however, Plaintiff’s counsel has refused.  (Ibid.)  Defense counsel has also requested a stipulation to a court order to have the vehicle released immediately after inspection or after 30 minutes of inspection, however Plaintiff’s counsel has again refused.  (Ibid. at pp. 4-5.)  Thus, Defendant agrees to the inspection either at a neutral outdoor location or with the condition that the vehicle be released after the conclusion of inspection.  (Ibid. at p. 5.) The Court finds that Plaintiff has satisfied the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.450 and is entitled to compel Plaintiff’s attendance and testimony at deposition.  Plaintiff has also presented good cause for compelling production of the vehicle for inspection. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendant’s Deposition and Production is GRANTED.  Defendant is ordered to appear at a properly noticed deposition, within thirty (30) days of the Court’s Order.  Furthermore, the Court imposes the condition that the vehicle be immediately returned to Defendant after conclusion of inspection or upon expiration of two (2) hours, whichever occurs first. B.     Requests for Production A party must respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.260(a).)  If a party to whom requests for production of documents is directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(c).)  The party also waives the right to make any objections, including ones based on privilege or work-product protection.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(a).)  There is no time limit for a motion to compel responses to production of documents other than the cut-off on hearing discovery motions 15 days before trial.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2024.020(a), 2031.300.)  No meet and confer efforts are required before filing a motion to compel responses to the discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) On August 9, 2022, Plaintiff served Defendant with a Demand for Inspection and Production of Vehicle, set for September 12, 2022, at Eli’s repair facility in Inglewood, CA.  (MTC Prod. - Thomas Decl. ¶ 2, Ex. 1.)  Defendant did not respond or serve an objection to the Demand.  (Ibid. at ¶ 4.)  On September 8, 2022, defense counsel asked for a three-week extension to respond to the written discovery and to reschedule the vehicle inspection date.  (Ibid. at ¶ 5, Ex. 3.)  On September 12, 2022, the attorneys discussed rescheduling the vehicle inspection date and agreed to schedule to a mutually convenient date, September 30.  (Ibid. at ¶ 6.)  Plaintiff’s counsel served Defendant with an amended Demand for Inspection and Production of Vehicle, set for September 30, 2022.  (Ibid. at ¶ 7, Ex. 2.)  On September 27, 2022, defense counsel asked for an extension to respond to the written discovery, but agreed to keep the inspection date of September 30, 2022; Plaintiff’s counsel provided a one-week extension to respond to the written discovery.  (Ibid. at ¶ 8.)  Plaintiff’s counsel traveled more than 3.5 hours for the inspection on September 30, 2022, however, Defendant did not appear with the vehicle.  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 9-10.)  On October 3, 2022, defense counsel explained that Defendant’s failure to appear was due to a miscommunication between Defendant and his attorney.  (Ibid. at ¶ 11.)  On December 9, 2022, the attorneys met and conferred over the telephone regarding the instant Motion.  (Ibid. at ¶ 12.)  On December 15, 2022, defense counsel offered to present the vehicle for inspection on January 10, 2023, thus, Plaintiff served a Second Amended Demand for Inspection of Vehicle.  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 13-14, Exs. 3-4.)  Despite several extensions, Defendant served an objection to the Second Amended Demand for Inspection.  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 15-16, Ex. 5.)  Between January 5 and 9, 2023, the attorneys exchanged several meet and confer emails regarding Defendant’s objection and insistence that conditions be imposed on the inspection.  (Ibid. at ¶ 17.)  On January 10, 2023, Defendant Brown failed to present the Porsche for inspection.  (Ibid. at ¶ 18.)  On August 16, 2023, the attorneys met and conferred telephonically but did not come to an agreement.  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 19-20.) Plaintiff states that it has a good faith basis for inspection of the Porsche as “a visual and photographic inspection of the Porsche at the same place and under the same conditions s when Mr. Brown approved the color match is of critical importance in this case.”  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 21-22.) Defendant presents the same objections to the instant Motion as he does to the Motion to Compel Deposition and Production of Vehicle. The Court finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated that it propounded a demand for production on Defendant and Defendant has improperly served objections, after objections had been waived, and has failed to produce the vehicle for inspection.  Although Plaintiff was not obligated to meet and confer with Defendant, Plaintiff’s counsel has extensively attempted to resolve the issue informally. For this reason, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Production of Vehicle for Inspection.  The vehicle must be produced for inspection at a time and date determined by Plaintiff.  To address Defendant’s concerns, the Court imposes the condition that the vehicle be immediately returned to Defendant after conclusion of inspection or upon expiration of two (2) hours, whichever occurs first. C.    Request for Sanctions Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030(a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone because of that conduct.  Misuse of discovery includes “failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §¿2023.010(d)). Furthermore, §§ 2025.450 and 2031.300 authorize the Court to impose monetary sanctions if a party fails to respond to requests for production or attend a scheduled deposition.             Plaintiff requests $3,633.80 in sanctions for the Motion to Compel Defendant Brown’s Deposition, as follows: attorney’s fees for five (5) hours for preparing the Motion, three (3) hours for reviewing the Opposition and preparing a reply, and one (1) hour for appearing at the hearing, at a discounted hourly rate of $395 per hour, plus $78.80 in motion filing fees and electronic filing charges.  (Thomas Decl. ¶¶ 16-19.) Plaintiff requests $5,016.30 for the Motion to Compel Production of Vehicle, as follows: attorney’s fees for 2.5 hours in traveling to the inspection location, one (1) hour for waiting for Defendant Brown, five (5) hours for preparing the Motion, three (3) hours for reviewing the Opposition and preparing a reply, and one (1) hour for appearing at the hearing, at a discounted hourly rate of $395 per hour, plus $78.80 in motion filing fees and electronic filing charges.  (Thomas Decl. ¶¶ 23-27.) Defendant opposes Plaintiff’s requests for monetary sanctions on the basis that Plaintiff has violated Code of Civil Procedure §2024.020(a) by serving the discovery request after the motion cut-off dates based on the date initially set for trial.  (Oppos. p. 5-6.)  Moreover, Defendant argues that the deposition notice did not provide proper statutory notice and thus, did not comply with Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.030, which requires the Notice to be served at least 30 days in advance. The Court continues the hearing on the Motion to further review Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions and Defendant’s arguments against a grant of sanctions. No additional papers may be filed by either party. III.            Conclusion & Order For the foregoing reasons, The hearing on Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Eli’s Collision Repair’s Motion to Compel Production of Vehicle for Inspection and Impose Monetary Sanctions of $5,016.30 is CONTINUED to September 21, 2023, at 10:30 a.m. in Department 25 at the SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. The hearing on Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Eli’s Collision Repair’s Motion to Compel Deposition of Defendant Brown, Production of a Vehicle for Inspection, and Order Imposing Monetary Sanctions of $3,6433.80 is CONTINUED to September 21, 2023, at 10:30 a.m. in Department 25 at the SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. No additional papers may be filed by either party. Moving party is ordered to give notice.
