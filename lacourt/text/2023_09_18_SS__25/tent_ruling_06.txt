 Case Number:  22STLC08083    Hearing Date:   September 18, 2023    Dept:  25  Richard Dahl v. Pursche-Gillingham, LLC, et al. 22stlc08083ANALYSIS:   I.                 Background   On August 5, 2022, Plaintiff Richard  Dahl (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendants Pursche-Gillingham, LLC  (“PG”), Apelila and J, LLC (“AJ”), Ono Hawaiian BBQ, Inc. (“Ono”), and Joshua  Liang (“Liang”) for an alleged violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act.   On January 30, 2023, Defendants AJ,  Ono, and Liang filed an Answer to the Complaint.  Defendant PG filed an Answer on February 1,  2023. On March 14, 2023, Plaintiff  amended the Complaint to add HGL Restaurant Group, LLC (“HGL”) as Defendant Doe  1.  (3-14-23 Amendment to  Complaint.)  HGL filed an Answer on April  19, 2023.   On June 14, 2023, Plaintiff filed  another Amendment to Complaint, adding Upside Crenshaw Holding, LLC (“Upside”)  as Defendant Doe 6.  (6-14-23 Amendment  to Complaint.)   On July 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed the  instant Motion to Compel HGL’s Answer to Interrogatory (“Motion”).  Defendant HGL filed an Opposition on August  3, 2023.   On August 16, 2023, Plaintiff’s  counsel informed the Court that he had received the response to the  interrogatories; however, the Court continued the hearing on the Motion and  ordered Defendant to file supplemental proof that the response to Special Interrogatory  No. 5 had been properly served on Plaintiff.   (8-16-23 Minute Order.)  The Court  indicated that it would address the matter of monetary sanctions at the next  scheduled hearing.  (Ibid.)   On August 24, 2023, Defendant HGL  filed supplemental papers in response to the Court’s August 16, 2023, Order.   On August 29, 2023, pursuant to  Plaintiff’s request, the Court entered default against Defendant Upside.  (8-29-23 Request for Entry of Default.)   II.               Legal  Standard & Discussion   A.     Interrogatories   A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days  after service.  (Code Civ. Proc.  § 2030.260(a).)  If a party to whom  interrogatories are directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting  party may move for an order compelling response to the discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(b).)  Once compelled to respond, the party waives  the right to make any objections, including ones based on privilege or  work-product protection.  (Code Civ.  Proc. § 2030.290(a).)  There is no  time limit for a motion to compel responses to interrogatories other than the  cut-off on hearing discovery motions 15 days before trial.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2024.020(a),  2030.290.)  No meet and confer efforts  are required before filing a motion to compel responses to the discovery.  (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.  Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)   Plaintiff moves to compel Defendant HGL’s verified answer  to Interrogatory No. 5 from Special Interrogatories (Set One).  (Mot. p. 1.)   Plaintiff also requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $500.  (Mot. p. 1.)   On April 24, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant HGL with  Special Interrogatories, Set One.   (Mehrban Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. A.)   Plaintiff did not receive a verified response to Special Interrogatory  No. 5.  (Ibid. at ¶ 4.)  Plaintiff’s counsel sent a follow-up letter  to Defendant HGL.  (Ibid. at ¶ 5,  Ex. B.)   Defendant HGL opposes the Motion.  Defense counsel explains that Special  Interrogatories served on Defendant HGL were double-sided and Special  Interrogatory No. 5 was on the second page, which was not scanned into defense  counsel’s system.  (Lewis Decl. ¶¶  2-3.)  Defense counsel requested a  two-week extension; however, Plaintiff’s counsel did not agree to the  extension, unless the responses were without objections.  (Ibid.)  Thus, defense counsel served written  responses to the Special Interrogatories on May 30, 2023.  (Ibid. at ¶ 4.)  Defense counsel states that Plaintiff had 45  days after the service date to compel responses.  (Ibid. at ¶ 5.)  Moreover, Plaintiff’s counsel attempted to  meet and confer on May 31, 2023, but defense counsel thought Special  Interrogatory No. 5 was a “copy and paste error” since it was not in his  records.  (Ibid. at ¶ 6.)  On June 29, 2023, Defendant served  supplemental responses to the Special Interrogatories in defense counsel’s  records.  (Ibid. at ¶ 7.)  After Plaintiff filed and served the instant  Motion, defense counsel learned that there was a second page that included  Special Interrogatory No. 5.  (Ibid.  at ¶¶ 8-9.)  Defense counsel informed  Plaintiff’s counsel of his mistake and intention to serve a verified  substantive response, which he served on July 24, 2023.  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 9-10.)  On July 31, 2023, defense counsel sent a  letter requesting that Plaintiff withdraw the Motion and followed up by email  and phone on August 2, 2023; however, Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond.  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 11-12, Exs. A-B.)  Defendant HGL requests that the Court deny  the Motion because it is moot and deny Plaintiff’s request for monetary  sanctions.  (Oppos. p. 2.)   At the hearing on August 16, 2023,  the Court noted that Plaintiff has filed a motion to compel an initial response  pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.290, not a motion to compel a  further response pursuant to § 2030.300.   (8-16-23 Minute Order.)  Thus, there is no time limit for filing the  instant Motion, other than the cut-off on hearing discovery motions 15 days  before trial, and there is no pre-filing meet and confer requirement.  (Ibid.; Code Civ. Proc. §§  2024.020(a), 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare  Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th  390, 411.)   Moreover, the Court noted that Plaintiff  has demonstrated that he has propounded  Special Interrogatories on Defendant HGL.   (8-16-23 Minute Order.)  Although,  Defendant HGL argues that it inadvertently missed Special Interrogatory No. 5  and served a response after the Motion was filed, Defendant did not present the  Court with any evidence that the response was properly served.  (Ibid.)  At the hearing, Plaintiff confirmed that he  had received Defendant’s response to Special Interrogatory No. 5; however, the  Court continued the hearing on the Motion and ordered Defendant to file proof  that Plaintiff had been properly served with the response.  (Ibid.)   On August 24, 2023, Defendant filed the Supplemental  Declaration of Jeremy Lewis in response to the Court’s August 16, 2023,  Order.  Counsel has submitted proof that  the verified response to Special Interrogatory No. was served on Defendant on  July 24, 2023.  (Supp. Lewis Decl. ¶  10, Ex. A.)  Defendant HGL argues that  the Motion has been rendered moot.   (Supp. Brief p. 2.) The Court finds that Defendant has  properly served the response to Special Interrogatory No. 5 and Plaintiff has  confirmed receipt at the August 16, 2023, hearing.  Accordingly, the Motion to Compel is placed  off calendar as moot.   B.    Sanctions   Code of Civil Procedure §  2023.030(a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose a monetary  sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process to pay the  reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone because of  that conduct.  Misuse of discovery  includes “failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of  discovery.”  (Code Civ. Proc.  § 2023.010(d)).   Furthermore, §  2030.290(c) authorizes the Court to impose monetary sanctions if a party fails  to respond to interrogatories, “unless it finds that the one subject to  the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances  make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  Sanctions are calculated based on “reasonable  expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that  conduct.”  (Ibid. § 2023.030(a)).   Plaintiff requests $500 in sanctions for Defendant HGL’s  failure to respond to the instant discovery request.  (Mehrban Decl. ¶ 6.)  Plaintiff’s counsel states that his hourly  rate is $500.00 per hour, and he has “spent and will spend a cumulative total  of no less than one hour in communicating with said Defendant regarding this  motion, preparing the motion, and appearing at the hearing on the motion.”  (Ibid.)   Defendant HGL argues that the Court should deny Plaintiff’s  request for monetary sanctions because it acted with substantial justification  and imposition of sanctions would be unjust.   (Supp. Brief pp. 2-3.)  Here,  Defendant’s failure to comply “was by no means willful” as it was an  inadvertent “administrative error.”  (Ibid.  at p. 3.)  After discovering the  existence of Special Interrogatory No. 5, “Defendant acted promptly and  diligently after realizing the error and provided a verified substantive response  to Plaintiff.”  (Ibid.)  Moreover, “Defendant is substantially  justified in opposing Plaintiff’s Motion” as it has served a response and the  Motion has been rendered moot.  (Ibid.)  Finally, Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s  request for sanctions in the amount of $500 is excessive and inflated.  (Ibid. at pp. 3-5.)   The Court finds that Defendant HGL’s failure to timely  respond to Special Interrogatory No. 5 was due to an administrative error and  not misuse of the discovery process.   After discovering the error, Defendant acted promptly to provide the  response.  Thus, Defendant acted with  substantial justification and the imposition of sanctions would be unjust.               Accordingly,  Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions is denied.     III.             Conclusion  & Order   For the foregoing reasons:   Plaintiff Richard Dahl’s Motion to Compel HGL Restaurant  Group, LLC’s Answer to Interrogatory is PLACED OFF CALENDAR AS MOOT.  Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions is  DENIED.   Moving party is ordered to  give notice.
