 Case Number:  21STLC06138    Hearing Date:   September 18, 2023    Dept:  25  Jose
Manuel Gonzalez v. Los Angeles Police Department 21stlc06138ANALYSIS:
 
I.               
Background
 
On August 20, 2021, Plaintiff Jose
Manuel Gonzalez (“Plaintiff” or “Gonzales”), in propria persona, filed a
Complaint against Defendant Los Angeles Police Department (“Defendant” or
“LAPD”) for personal injury, property damages, wrongful death.
 
On January 30, 2023, Plaintiff
filed Proof of Service of Summons by mail and acknowledgment of receipt of
service, indicating that the pleadings were mailed to 100 West 1st Street, Room
228, Los Angeles, CA 90012.
 
On February 17, 2023, the date set
for Non-Jury Trial, the Court noted that service was not properly effectuated
on Defendant and placed trial off calendar. 
(2-17-23 Minute Order.)  The Court
set Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to File Proof of Service for April 26,
2023.  (Ibid.)  On April 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed Proof of
Service indicating that the pleadings had been personally served on Defendant
LAPD and the City of Los Angeles, City Clerk, at 200 North Spring Street, Los
Angeles, CA 90012.  Accordingly, on April
26, 2023, the Court discharged the OSC Re: Failure to File Proof of Service and
set Order to Show Cause Re: Defendant’s Filing of an Answer or Plaintiff’s
Entry of Default for June 27, 2023. 
(4-26-23 Minute Order.)  Plaintiff
filed another Proof of Service of pleadings, indicating that he had personally
served LAPD on May 30, 2023, at 200 Spring Street, Los Angeles, CA 90012.
 
            On June 26,
2023, Defendant City of Los Angeles (erroneously sued as LAPD) filed the instant
Motion to Dismiss (“Motion”).  On August
28, 2023, Defendant filed Notice of Non-Opposition to Motion.  No opposition has been filed.
 
            On August
28, 2023, the Court continued the hearing on the Motion to September 18,
2023.  (8-28-23 Minute Order.)
 
II.             
Legal Standard & Discussion
 
Defendant City of Los Angeles
(“City”) moves to dismiss the Complaint filed by Plaintiff Gonzalez on the
grounds that Plaintiff did not serve the Complaint within 60 days, as required
by California Rules of Court, rule 3.110(b) and thus, the Complaint is subject
to dismissal pursuant to the Government Code § 68608(b) and Code of Civil Procedure § 575.2(a).  (Mot. p. 2.)
 
First, Defendant argues that dismissal is appropriate
because Plaintiff is representing himself and thus, noncompliance with rule
3.110(b) was entirely due to his own conduct. 
(Ibid. at p. 4.)  Second,
less severe sanctions against Plaintiff would not be effective because the record
reflects that Plaintiff failed to comply with the rule after the Court set
Orders to Show Cause.  (Ibid. at
pp. 4-5.)  Plaintiff missed the deadline
to serve Defendant by 588 days, or 1.6 years, when he served Defendant on May 30,
2023.  (Ibid. at p. 5.)
 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.110(b)
states that a complaint must be served and proof of service must be filed
within 60 days after the complaint is filed. 
Plaintiff may file an application for a court order to extend the time
for service, but plaintiff must file for an extension before the time for
service has elapsed.  (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.110(e).)  If the plaintiff
does not comply with rule 3.110(b) and (d), fails to serve the complaint within
the permitted time, and does not request an extension, “the court may issue an
order to show cause why sanctions shall not be imposed.”  (Ibid. at rule 3.110(f).)
 
Furthermore, pursuant to Government
Code § 68608(b), “Judges shall have all the powers to impose sanctions
authorized by law, including the power to dismiss actions or strike pleadings,
if it appears that less severe sanctions would not be effective after taking
into account the effect of previous sanctions or previous lack of compliance in
the case. Judges are encouraged to impose sanctions to achieve the purposes of
this article.”  According to Code of
Civil Procedure § 575.2, “local rules promulgated pursuant to Section 575.1 may
provide that if any counsel, a party represented by counsel, or a party if in
pro se, fails to comply with any of the requirements thereof, the court on
motion of a party or on its own motion may strike out all or any part of any
pleading of that party, or, dismiss the action or proceeding or any part
thereof, or enter a judgment by default against that party, or impose other
penalties of a lesser nature as otherwise provided by law, and may order that
party or his or her counsel to pay to the moving party the reasonable expenses
in making the motion, including reasonable attorney fees. No penalty may be
imposed under this section without prior notice to, and an opportunity to be
heard by, the party against whom the penalty is sought to be imposed.”
 
Having reviewed Defendant’s legal
arguments and evidence, the Court does not find that Defendant has presented a sufficient
basis for dismissal of the Complaint. 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.110, provides the Court with the
discretionary authority to set an order to show cause regarding sanctions if a
party fails to timely serve pleadings and file proof of service.  Here, the Court set an OSC Re: Failure to
File Proof of Service on February 17, 2023. 
(2-17-23 Minute Order.)  After
Plaintiff filed Proof of Service on April 3, 2023, the Court discharged the
OSC.  (4-26-23 Minute Order.)  The Court also notes that Government Code §
68608(b) and Code of Civil Procedure § 575.2 both provide the Court with the
discretionary power to impose sanctions, including dismissal of an action, but
do not require the Court to dismiss the action for Plaintiff’s failure to
timely serve Defendant.  Finally,
Defendant mistakenly asserts that the record shows a history of non-compliance
after the Court’s imposition of less severe sanctions.  To date, the Court has not imposed any
sanctions against Plaintiff.  The Court
set an OSC regarding Plaintiff’s failure to serve Defendant and discharged the
OSC because Plaintiff complied and properly served Defendant.
 
Accordingly, the Court does not
find that Defendant has presented sufficient evidence or arguments
demonstrating that the Court must dismiss the action because of Plaintiff’s
delayed service of the pleadings. 
Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss is denied.
 
III.           
Conclusion
 
For the foregoing reasons,
 
The Motion to Dismiss, filed by
Defendant City of Los Angeles (erroneously sued as Los Angeles Police
Department), is DENIED without prejudice.
 
Moving party is to give notice.
