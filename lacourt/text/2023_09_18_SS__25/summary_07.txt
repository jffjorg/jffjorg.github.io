Summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling sets forth the background of the case, including the filing of a complaint by Plaintiffs Erica Henderson and Jeffrey Henderson against Defendants Eden Iris Gardens LLC, et al. for breach of implied warranty of habitability, negligence, nuisance, personal injury, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and breach of contract. The Judge notes that the case has a complex history, with multiple demurrers filed by the Defendants and oppositions filed by the Plaintiffs.

The Judge's ruling addresses the legal standard for demurrers, including the requirement that the pleadings be tested for legal sufficiency and that the Court give a reasonable interpretation to the facts pleaded. The Judge also notes the requirements for meeting and conferring with the opposing party and filing a declaration detailing the efforts made to resolve the objections to the demurrer.

The Judge finds several deficiencies in the Oppositions filed by the Plaintiffs, including the lack of signature and service on Defendant FPI Management, Inc., the failure to file the Oppositions with the Court, and the insufficient time for the Defendants to review the Oppositions and file replies. As a result, the Judge continues the hearings on the demurrers with motions to strike and orders the Plaintiffs to correct the deficiencies noted in the Court's Order. The Judge also orders the Plaintiffs to serve Defendant FPI Management, Inc. with the Opposition to the Demurrer with Motion to Strike at least nine (9) court days before the next scheduled hearing and to file the Oppositions that have been served on the other Defendants at least nine (9) court days before the next scheduled hearing.
