Summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling sets forth the background of the case, including the filing of a complaint by Plaintiffs Erica Henderson and Jeffrey Henderson against Defendants Eden Iris Gardens LLC, et al. for breach of implied warranty of habitability, negligence, nuisance, personal injury, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and breach of contract. The Judge notes that the case has a complex history, with multiple demurrers filed by the Defendants and oppositions filed by the Plaintiffs.

The Judge's ruling addresses the legal standard for demurrers, including the requirement that the pleadings be tested for legal sufficiency and that the Court give a reasonable interpretation to the facts pleaded. The Judge also notes the requirements for meeting and conferring with the opposing party and filing a declaration detailing the efforts made to resolve the objections to the demurrer.

The Judge finds several deficiencies in the Oppositions filed by the Plaintiffs, including the lack of signature and service on Defendant FPI Management, Inc., the failure to file the Oppositions with the Court, and the insufficient time for the Defendants to review the Oppositions and file replies. As a result, the Judge continues the hearings on the demurrers with motions to strike and orders the Plaintiffs to correct the deficiencies noted in the Court's Order. The Judge also orders the Plaintiffs to serve Defendant FPI Management, Inc. with the Opposition to the Demurrer with Motion to Strike at least nine (9) court days before the next scheduled hearing and to file the Oppositions that have been served on the other Defendants at least nine (9) court days before the next scheduled hearing.

### English Text Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling

The Judge's tentative ruling is in regards to the case number 22STLC08431, which involves Plaintiffs Erica Henderson and Jeffrey Henderson and Defendants Eden Iris Gardens LLC, Rockvale Apartments LP, Rockvale Apartments GP LLC, Rockvale Apartments Limited LLC, and FPI Management Inc. The Judge has reviewed the pleadings and made several rulings on the Demurrers with Motions to Strike filed by the Defendants.

The Judge sustained some of the Demurrers and overruled others, finding that the Plaintiffs' Complaint was insufficient in some respects. The Judge also granted the Plaintiffs' request for an extension of time to oppose the Demurrers and ordered the Plaintiffs to file their Oppositions with the Court.

However, the Judge found that the Plaintiffs had not filed their Oppositions with the Court and had only served them on the Defendants by mail. The Judge also found that the Plaintiffs had not given the Defendants sufficient time to review the Oppositions and file replies.

As a result, the Judge continued the hearings on the Demurrers with Motions to Strike to October 16, 2023, and ordered the Plaintiffs to correct the deficiencies in their Oppositions. The Judge also ordered the Defendants to file replies to the Oppositions at least five court days before the next scheduled hearing.

The Judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on further arguments and submissions from the parties. The parties are ordered to give notice of the continued hearings and to comply with the Court's orders.
