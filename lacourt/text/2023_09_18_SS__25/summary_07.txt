And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is continuing the hearings on the demurrers with motions to strike filed by the defendants. The court has noted several deficiencies in the plaintiffs' oppositions, including the lack of signed oppositions and the failure to file the oppositions with the court. The court is also concerned that the defendants may not have sufficient time to review the oppositions and file replies by the hearing dates. The judge has ordered the plaintiffs to correct these deficiencies and has continued the hearings to October 16, 2023.
