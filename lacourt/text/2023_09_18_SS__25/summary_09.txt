And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a petition to confirm an arbitration award in the amount of $25,000 in favor of Petitioners Michael Sanders and Trisha Atkinson against Respondents Oren Badler and OB Floors, Inc. The arbitration award was issued on May 24, 2022, and the petition to confirm was filed on March 1, 2023. The petition lists the incorrect address for the Spring Street Courthouse, but the Judge waives this error. The hearing on the petition was continued on August 16, 2023, due to lack of notice of continuance. The Judge orders Petitioners to file a clear copy of the Home Improvement Contract, along with the "Arbitration of Disputes" attachment, and continues the hearing to October 24, 2023.
