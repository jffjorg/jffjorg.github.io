And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award filed by Michael Sanders and Trisha Atkinson against Oren Badler and OB Floors, Inc. The arbitration award was issued by Arbitrator Kathy Vodges, Esq. on May 24, 2022, in the amount of $25,000. The Petition was filed on March 1, 2023, and the Court has been dealing with various continuances and requests for postponements.

The Court has noted several issues, including an erroneous address on the Petition and failure to serve notice of continuance. The Court has waived the erroneous address and ordered the Petitioners to file a clear copy of the Home Improvement Contract and the "Arbitration of Disputes" attachment.

The Court has also raised concerns about the service of the arbitration award, noting that there is no evidence that a neutral arbitrator served a copy of the award on the parties. The Court has ordered the Petitioners to file supplemental papers and has continued the hearing to October 24, 2023.

In this tentative ruling, Judge of Department 25 of the Superior Court addressed the Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award filed by Michael Sanders and Trisha Atkinson against Oren Badler and OB Floors, Inc. The arbitration award was issued in favor of the plaintiffs for $25,000 on May 24, 2022. The plaintiffs filed the petition on March 1, 2023, and the defendants were served with the petition and notice of hearing on June 27, 2023. The court noted an incorrect address on the petition and continued the hearing on August 16, 2023. However, the plaintiffs did not serve the respondents with a notice of continuance. The court gave notice to Petitioner Sanders and Respondent Badler.

The legal standard for confirming an arbitration award is that the award is enforceable only when confirmed as a judgment of the superior court. Any of the parties may file a petition with the court, which must then confirm the award, correct and confirm it, vacate it, or dismiss the petition. The scope of judicial review of arbitration awards is extremely narrow.

In this case, the plaintiffs have complied with most of the requirements for the instant Petition, but the court finds it difficult to review the copy of the Home Improvement Contract attached. Thus, the court orders Petitioners to file a clear copy of the Home Improvement Contract, along with the “Arbitration of Disputes” attachment. The hearing on the Petition is continued to October 24, 2023, at 10:00 A.M. in Department 25 at Spring Street Courthouse. Failure to comply with this order may result in the Petition being placed off calendar or denied.

## English Summary:

The judge is considering a petition from Michael Sanders and Trisha Atkinson to confirm an arbitration award against Oren Badler and OB Floors, Inc. 

While the petitioners have generally followed the proper procedures, the judge has identified some issues.  

First, the judge notes that the copy of the Home Improvement Contract submitted as evidence is difficult to read and lacks a crucial section detailing the arbitration clause. 

Second, while the petitioners claim they served the arbitration award on the defendants, they haven't provided proof that a neutral arbitrator, as required by law, actually served the award. 

Because of these issues, the judge has continued the hearing to October 24, 2023, giving the petitioners time to provide a clearer copy of the contract and evidence of proper service of the award.

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a summary of the case and the Judge's thoughts on the matter based on the information presented before the hearing. The case involves a petition to confirm an arbitration award in the amount of $25,000 in favor of Petitioners Michael Sanders and Trisha Atkinson against Respondents Oren Badler and OB Floors, Inc.

The Judge notes that the Petition was filed on March 1, 2023, and that the Respondents have not filed an opposition. The Judge also notes that the Petition lists the Van Nuys Courthouse East address instead of the address for the Spring Street Courthouse, but waives the error given that the Petitioners served the Court's Notice of Hearing on the correct address.

The Judge also finds that the service requirement has been met, and that the Petitioners have submitted sufficient evidence to support their petition. However, the Judge finds it difficult to review the copy of the Home Improvement Contract attached to the petition, and orders the Petitioners to file a clear copy of the contract, along with the “Arbitration of Disputes” attachment.

The Judge grants the petition and confirms the arbitration award, but continues the hearing to October 24, 2023, to allow the Petitioners to submit the supplemental papers.

Summary:
The Judge's tentative ruling for Case Number 23STCP00652 concerns the confirmation of an arbitration award in the amount of $25,000 for Plaintiffs Michael Sanders and Trisha Atkinson and against Defendants Oren Badler and OB Floors, Inc. The Judge explains the legal standard for confirming an arbitration award and its narrow scope of review. The Judge also highlights that a petition under this chapter shall include the substance of the arbitration agreement, names of the arbitrators, and a copy of the award and written opinion of the arbitrators. The Judge discusses the incorrect address listed on the petition and the lack of a clear home improvement contract, leading to the continuation of the hearing to October 24, 2023.
