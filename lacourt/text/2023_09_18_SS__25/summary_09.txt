The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award filed by Michael Sanders and Trisha Atkinson against Oren Badler and OB Floors, Inc. The arbitration award was issued by Arbitrator Kathy Vodges, Esq. on May 24, 2022, in the amount of $25,000. The Petition was filed on March 1, 2023, and the Court has been dealing with various continuances and requests for postponements.

The Court has noted several issues, including an erroneous address on the Petition and failure to serve notice of continuance. The Court has waived the erroneous address and ordered the Petitioners to file a clear copy of the Home Improvement Contract and the "Arbitration of Disputes" attachment.

The Court has also raised concerns about the service of the arbitration award, noting that there is no evidence that a neutral arbitrator served a copy of the award on the parties. The Court has ordered the Petitioners to file supplemental papers and has continued the hearing to October 24, 2023.

In this tentative ruling, Judge of Department 25 of the Superior Court addressed the Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award filed by Michael Sanders and Trisha Atkinson against Oren Badler and OB Floors, Inc. The arbitration award was issued in favor of the plaintiffs for $25,000 on May 24, 2022. The plaintiffs filed the petition on March 1, 2023, and the defendants were served with the petition and notice of hearing on June 27, 2023. The court noted an incorrect address on the petition and continued the hearing on August 16, 2023. However, the plaintiffs did not serve the respondents with a notice of continuance. The court gave notice to Petitioner Sanders and Respondent Badler.

The legal standard for confirming an arbitration award is that the award is enforceable only when confirmed as a judgment of the superior court. Any of the parties may file a petition with the court, which must then confirm the award, correct and confirm it, vacate it, or dismiss the petition. The scope of judicial review of arbitration awards is extremely narrow.

In this case, the plaintiffs have complied with most of the requirements for the instant Petition, but the court finds it difficult to review the copy of the Home Improvement Contract attached. Thus, the court orders Petitioners to file a clear copy of the Home Improvement Contract, along with the “Arbitration of Disputes” attachment. The hearing on the Petition is continued to October 24, 2023, at 10:00 A.M. in Department 25 at Spring Street Courthouse. Failure to comply with this order may result in the Petition being placed off calendar or denied.
