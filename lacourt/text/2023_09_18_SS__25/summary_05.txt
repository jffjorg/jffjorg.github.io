Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the Complaint filed by the Plaintiff, Jose Manuel Gonzalez. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff's failure to timely serve the Complaint is a sufficient basis for dismissal of the action. However, the Court does not find that the Defendant has presented a sufficient basis for dismissal.

The Court notes that the Plaintiff failed to serve the Defendant within the 60-day period required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.110(b).

**Case Number:** 21STLC06138

**Hearing Date:** September 18, 2023

**Dept:** 25

**Plaintiff:** Jose Manuel Gonzalez

**Defendant:** Los Angeles Police Department

---

On August 20, 2021, plaintiff Jose Manuel Gonzalez filed a complaint against the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) for personal injury, property damages, and wrongful death. The complaint was not properly served on the defendant within the required 60 days.

On February 17, 2023, the court placed the trial off calendar due to improper service and set an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to File Proof of Service for April 26, 2023. Plaintiff filed a proof of service on April 3, 2023, indicating that the pleadings had been personally served on the LAPD and the City of Los Angeles. The court discharged the OSC on April 26, 2023.

On June 26, 2023, the City of Los Angeles (erroneously sued as LAPD) filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the complaint is subject to dismissal due to the plaintiff's failure to serve the complaint within 60 days as required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.110(b). The court continued the hearing on the motion to September 18, 2023.

The court has reviewed the defendant's legal arguments and evidence and does not find that the defendant has presented a sufficient basis for dismissal of the complaint. The court has the discretionary power to impose sanctions, including dismissal of an action, but is not required to dismiss the action for the plaintiff's failure to timely serve the defendant. The defendant mistakenly asserts that the record shows a history of non-compliance after the court's imposition of less severe sanctions, but the court has not imposed any sanctions against the plaintiff.

Accordingly, the court denies the defendant's motion to dismiss.
