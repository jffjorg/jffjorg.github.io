And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration, filed on May 30, 2023. The motion is based on claims that the court misinterpreted the law and made errors in its previous orders. The judge has reviewed the motion and finds that Petitioner has not presented any new or different facts that would warrant reconsideration of the court's previous orders. The judge also finds that Petitioner has not complied with the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1110(b) and Code of Civil Procedure § 1008. The judge notes that Petitioner had a chance to review the tentative ruling prior to the hearing on the motion and to argue his case before the court, and was later served with the final ruling by the clerk on May 22, 2023. The judge orders Petitioner to give notice of its decision.
