## English Summary:

This is a tentative ruling in a case where Joseph Shalant is seeking to recover attorney's fees from Nicholas Tepper.  The Court previously awarded Shalant attorney's fees, but then vacated that award because Shalant's attorney was not a licensed member of the bar at the time. The Court has now reinstated the attorney's fees award.

Shalant has filed multiple motions for reconsideration, but the Court finds that he has not presented any new information to justify reconsidering its previous rulings. The Court denies Shalant's latest motion and emphasizes that he had ample opportunity to present his arguments. 

The Court also requires another party, Anna Viele, to provide evidence of her separation from Tepper. This is relevant because the Court previously believed that Viele might be responsible for Tepper's debt.

Summary:

Shalant against defendant Nicholas Tepper on August 1, 2019, for an attorney-client fee arbitration award. The Court granted the Petition on December 5, 2019, and entered a judgment against Respondent in the amount of $3,050.00 plus interest of 10% from August 18, 2018. Petitioner then filed a Motion for Attorney’s Fees, but did not appear at the hearing scheduled on December 1, 2020, and the Motion was placed off calendar. On November 18, 2022, the Court found that non-party Anna Viele is not responsible for Respondents’ outstanding debt due to legal separation and discharged Ms. Viele. The Court also vacated its Order, dated June 23, 2021, as Petitioner’s counsel, Steven L. Leighton, was not an active member of the bar at the time the Motion for Attorney’s Fees had been filed. On November 28, 2022, Petitioner filed a Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Motion for Reconsideration, but the Court identified various defects in the Motion preventing the Court from reaching a determination on the merits. The Court continued the hearing and instructed Petitioner to file and serve supplemental papers to correct the aforementioned defects.

Accordingly, the Court denied Petitioner’s Motion for Reconsideration, filed on May 30, 2023.

**Dept:** 25

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Joseph L. Shalant

**Summary:**

This case involves a dispute over attorney's fees.  Shalant initiated an action against Tepper to confirm an arbitration award in his favor.

The judge will likely deny Shalant's motion for reconsideration due to the following:

* The motion does not include all required information.
* Shalant has not presented any new or different facts to warrant reconsideration.
* The court previously addressed the legal arguments presented by Shalant.

Summary:
This is a summary of a tentative ruling by Judge Joseph L. Shalant in a case against Nicholas Tepper. The case is about a Petition to Confirm Attorney-Client Fee Arbitration Award, where Shalant filed a Motion for Attorney's Fees and Reconsideration. However, the Court found that Shalant failed to present new or different facts, and the burden was comparable to that of a party seeking a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence. The Court ruled that the information must be such that the moving party could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered or produced it at the trial. The Court also noted that reconsideration cannot be granted based on claims that the court misinterpreted the law in its initial ruling because this is not a 'new' or 'different' matter.
