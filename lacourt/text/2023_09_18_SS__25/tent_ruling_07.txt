(“FPI”), and Eden Iris Gardens, LLC (“Eden”) for (1) breach of implied  warranty of habitability, (2) negligence, (3) nuisance, (4) personal  injury, (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress, and (6) breach of  contract.   On April 19, 2023, Defendant FPI  filed a Demurrer with Motion to Strike Complaint.  Defendant Rockvale LP filed a Joinder to  Defendant FPI’s Demurrer with Motion to Strike.   On July 3, 2023, the Court denied Defendant Rockvale LP’s Joinder.  (7-3-23 Minute Order.)  The Court sustained FPI’s Demurrer to the first  cause of action for breach of implied warranty of habitability and sixth cause  of action for breach of contract without leave to amend and sustained the  Demurrer to the fifth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional  distress with 20 days leave to amend.  (Ibid.)  The Court overruled Defendant FPI’s Demurrer  to the third cause of action for nuisance.   (Ibid.)  The Court also  granted Defendant FPI’s Motion to Strike with 20 days leave to amend.  (Ibid.)   On May 26, 2023, Defendants Rockvale  GP and Rockvale Limited filed a joint Demurrer with Motion to Strike Complaint.  Defendants took the Demurrer with Motion to  Strike Complaint off calendar on August 22, 2023.   On June 20 and 21, 2023, Defendant  Eden Housing, Inc. (erroneously sued as Eden Iris Gardens, LLC) filed a  Demurrer and Motion to Strike Plaintiffs’ Complaint, set for hearing on August  23, 2023.  Defendants took the Demurrer  and Motion to Strike off calendar on August 7, 2023.               On Juy 24,  2023, Plaintiffs filed the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”).               On August  14, 2023, Defendants Rockvale LP, Rockvale GP, Rockvale Limited filed a  Demurrer with Motion to Strike Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for Damages,  set for hearing on September 18, 2023.                On August  17, 2023, Defendant FPI filed a Demurrer with Motion to Strike Plaintiffs’  First Amended Complaint, set for hearing on September 19, 2023.  Plaintiffs filed Oppositions on September 5,  2023.               On August  24, 2023, Defendants Eden Housing, Inc. and Eden Iris Gardens, LLC, filed a  Demurrer with Motion to Strike First Amended Complaint, set for hearing on  September 19, 2023.               On  September 7, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff Erica Henderson’s Ex Parte  Application for Extension of Time to oppose the Demurrers with Motions to  Strike, filed by (1) Defendants Rockvale LP, Rockvale GP, and Rockvale Limited,  set for hearing on September 18, 2023, (2) Defendants Eden Housing, Inc. and  Eden Iris Gardens, LLC, set for hearing on September 19, 2023, and (3)  Defendant FPI, set for hearing on September 19, 2023.  (9-7-23 Ex Parte ¶ 6.)  The Court ordered the oppositions to be filed  by September 13, 2023.  (Ibid.)               On  September 13, 2023, Plaintiffs filed Proof of Service of the Oppositions on  Defendants by mail.  However, the  Oppositions have not been filed with the Court.   II.               Legal Standard   A demurrer is a pleading that may  be used to test the legal sufficiency of the factual allegations in the complaint.  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 430.10.)  There are two types of demurrers – general demurrers  and special demurrers.  (See McKenney  v. Purepac Pharmaceutical Co. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 72, 77.)   General demurrers can be used to  attack pleadings for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of  action or for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10(e); McKenney, 167 Cal.App.4th at 77.)  Such  demurrers can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the  pleading or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable;  evidence or extrinsic matters are not considered.  (Code of Civ. Proc. §§ 430.30, 430.70;  Blank  v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.  (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  For the  purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the Court admits “all material  facts properly pleaded” and “matters which may be judicially noticed,” but does  not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law.  [Citation].”  (Blank, 39 Cal.3d at  318.)  It gives these facts “a reasonable  interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.”  (Ibid.). At the pleading  stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the  defendant of the factual basis for the claim against him.  (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal.  App. 3d 714, 721.)  The face of the  complaint includes exhibits attached to the complaint.  (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189  Cal.App.3d 91, 94.)  "If facts  appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits  take precedence."  (Holland v.  Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447.)   Special demurrers can be used to  attack the pleadings on grounds that the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, and  unintelligible, or in a contract case, for failure to allege whether a contract  is oral or written.  (Code Civ. Proc., §  430.10(f).)  However, special demurrers  are not allowed in limited jurisdiction civil actions and any grounds for  special demurrers must be raised as affirmative defenses in the answer.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 92(c).)   Moreover, Code of Civil Procedure  § 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring  party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed  the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether  an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in  the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a).)  The parties are to meet and confer at least  five days before the date the responsive pleading is due.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(2).)  Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and  serve a declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(3).)   When a demurrer  is sustained, the Court determines whether there is a reasonable possibility  that the defect can be cured by amendment.   (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  When a plaintiff “has pleaded the general set  of facts upon which his cause of action is based,” the court should give the  plaintiff an opportunity to amend his complaint, since plaintiff should not “be  deprived of his right to maintain his action on the ground that his pleadings  were defective for lack of particulars.”  (Reed v. Norman (1957)  152 Cal.App.2d 892, 900.)  Generally, the  court will allow leave to amend on at least the first try, unless there is  absolutely no possibility of overcoming the issue.  (See Angie M. v. Superior Court  (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227 ("Denial of leave to amend constitutes an  abuse of discretion unless the complaint shows on its face it is incapable of  amendment.  [Citation.]  Liberality in permitting amendment is the  rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.").)   III.             Discussion               On  September 7, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff Erica Henderson’s Ex Parte  Application for Extension of Time to oppose the Demurrers with Motions to  Strike, filed by (1) Defendants Rockvale LP, Rockvale GP, and Rockvale Limited, set for hearing on September 18, 2023, (2)  Defendants Eden Housing, Inc. and Eden Iris Gardens, LLC, set for hearing on  September 19, 2023, and (3) Defendant FPI, set for hearing on September 19,  2023.  (9-7-23 Ex Parte ¶ 6.)  The Court ordered the oppositions to be filed  by September 13, 2023.  (Ibid.)               On  September 13, 2023, Plaintiffs filed Proof of Service, indicating that the  Oppositions had been served on Defendants Rockvale LP, Rockvale GP, and  Rockvale Limited, and Defendants Eden Housing,  Inc. and Eden Iris Gardens, LLC, by mail on September 12, 2023.               The Court  finds the following deficiencies.               First,  Plaintiffs filed Oppositions to Defendant FPI’s Demurrer with Motion to Strike  on September 5, 2023.  However, the  Oppositions are not signed and there is no indication that they have been  served on Defendant FPI.               Second,  Plaintiffs filed Proof of Service, indicating that Defendants Rockvale LP,  Rockvale GP, and Rockvale Limited, and Defendants Eden Housing and Eden Iris  Gardens have been served with Oppositions to their Motions.  However, Plaintiffs have not filed these  Oppositions with the Court.               Third,  Plaintiffs served Defendants Rockvale LP, Rockvale GP, and Rockvale Limited,  and Defendants Eden Housing and Eden Iris Gardens with the Oppositions on  September 12, 2023, by mail.  If  Defendants received these Oppositions within five (5) days, they would not have  sufficient time to review the Oppositions and file replies by the hearing dates  on September 18 and 19, 2023.               For these  reasons, the Court continues the hearings on the Demurrers with Motions to  Strike, filed by (1) Defendants Rockvale LP, Rockvale  GP, and Rockvale Limited, (2) Defendants FPI and (3) Defendants Eden Housing Eden  Iris Gardens.  Plaintiffs are ordered to  correct the deficiencies noted in the Court’s Order.  Defendants may file replies at least five (5)  court days before the next scheduled hearing.   IV.             Conclusion & Order    For the foregoing reasons:   The following Motions are CONTINUED to October 16, 2023, at 10:30 a.m. in Department 25 at the SPRING STREET  COURTHOUSE.   (1)    Demurrer with Motion  to Strike, filed by Defendants Rockvale Apartments LP, Rockvale Apartments GP,  LLC, and Rockvale Apartments Limited, LLC; (currently set for today, September 18, 2023) (2)    Demurrer with Motion  to Strike, filed by Defendant FPI Management, Inc.; (currently scheduled for September 19, 2023) (3)    Demurrer with Motion  to Strike, filed by Defendants Eden Housing, Inc. and Eden Iris Gardens, LLC (currently scheduled for September 19, 2023).   Plaintiffs  are ordered to serve Defendant FPI Managements, Inc. with the Opposition to the  Demurrer with Motion to Strike at least nine (9) court days before the next  scheduled hearing.   Plaintiffs  are ordered to file the Oppositions that have been served on Defendants  Rockvale Apartments LP, Rockvale Apartments GP, LLC, and Rockvale Apartments  Limited, LLC, and Defendants Eden Housing, Inc. and Eden Iris Gardens, LLC. at  least nine (9) court days before the next scheduled hearing.   Defendants  may file replies to the Oppositions, at least five (5) court days before the  hearing.   Moving party to give notice.
