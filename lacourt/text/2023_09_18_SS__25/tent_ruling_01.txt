  Case Number:  19STCP03300    Hearing Date:   September 18, 2023    Dept:  25  Joseph L. Shalant v. Nicholas Tepper 19stcp03300ANALYSIS:
 
I.               
Background
 
On August 1, 2019, Petitioner Joseph L. Shalant
(“Petitioner”) initiated this action by filing a Petition to Confirm
Attorney-Client Fee Arbitration Award against Respondent Nicholas Tepper
(“Respondent”). The Court granted the Petition on December 5, 2019, and entered
a judgment against Respondent in the amount of $3,050.00 plus interest of 10%
from August 18, 2018.  (12-5-19 Minute
Order.)  The Court also noted that
Petitioner could file a noticed motion if he intended to request attorney’s
fees. (Ibid.) 
 
Petitioner filed his first Motion for Attorney’s Fees on
February 27, 2020.  On October 28, 2020,
the Court noted that Petitioner had not cited any authority for its request and
continued the hearing to allow Petitioner additional time to file supplemental
papers.  (10-28-20 Minute Order.)  Petitioner did not appear at the hearing
scheduled on December 1, 2020, and the Court found that Petitioner had not
filed any supplemental papers as requested, so the Motion was placed off
calendar. (12-1-20 Minute Order.) 
 
On January 22, 2021, Petitioner filed a Motion to Hear
Matter Previously Taken Off Calendar re Issuance of Judgment Pursuant to
Confirming Arbitration Award, essentially a request for a hearing on the Motion
for Attorney’s Fees.  On June 23, 2021,
the Court granted Petitioner’s Motion in the amount of $2,876.25 in attorney’s
fees and $635 in costs.  (6-23-21 Minute
Order.)
 
On November 18, 2022, the Court
found that non-party Anna Viele is not responsible for Respondents’ outstanding
debt due to legal separation, and discharged Ms. Viele.  (11-18-22 Minute Order.)  The Court also vacated its Order, dated June
23, 2021, as Petitioner’s counsel, Steven L. Leighton, was not an active member
of the bar at the time the Motion for Attorney’s Fees had been filed.  (Ibid.)
 
On November 28, 2022, Petitioner
filed a Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Motion for Reconsideration.  On March 6, 2023, the Court identified
various defects in the Motion preventing the Court from reaching a determination
on the merits.  (3-6-23 Minute
Order.)  Specifically, the Court found
that it was difficult to discern whether Petitioner was seeking either
reconsideration of the Court’s November 18, 2022, Order or an issuance of
attorney fee’s in an amount between $5,000 and $6,000.  (Ibid.)  Additionally, the Court found that Petitioner
did not specify legal authority that would allow the Court to reconsider its
November 18, 2022, Order.  (Ibid.)
 Furthermore, the Court found that the Motion
did not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1008 and
2012, Evidence Code § 1400, and California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1110(b).  (Ibid.) 
As such, the Court continued the hearing to May 10, 2023, and instructed
Petitioner to file and serve supplemental papers to correct the aforementioned
defects.  (Ibid.)  On March 27, 2023, Petitioner filed an Amended Motion.  On May 10, 2023, the Court denied
Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration. 
(5-10-23 Minute Order.)  However,
the Court, on its own motion, reconsidered its November 18, 2022, Order and
reinstated the prior grant of attorney’s fees and costs in the amount of
$3,521.25.  (Ibid.)  Furthermore, the Court ordered Ms. Viele to
provide some evidence of the date of her separation, either by declaration or
legal documents within twenty (20) days’ notice.  (Ibid.)
 
On May 17, 2023, after the Court issued the final order
on Petitioner’s Motion for Reconsideration, Petitioner filed a Supplement to
Motion for Reconsideration with additional arguments for the Court to consider
in its ruling.
 
On May 30, 2023, Petitioner filed another Motion for
Reconsideration (“Motion”).  
 
On August 14, 2023, the Court noted several deficiencies
in the Motion.  (8-14-23 Minute
Order.)  The Court also indicated that
non-party Viele had not submitted evidence of separation, as ordered by the
Court on May 10, 2023, and thus, the Court continued the hearing on the
Motion.  (Ibid.)
 
On August 28, 2023, Petitioner filed another declaration
in support of his Motion.
 
II.             
Legal Standard
 
Code
of Civil Procedure § 1008 provides, in pertinent part:
 
“(a)
When an application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and
refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms,
any party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the
party of written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different
facts, circumstances, or law, make an application to the same judge or court
that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the
prior order. The party making the application shall state by affidavit what
application was made before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions
were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed
to be shown.
 
(b)
A party who originally made an application for an order which was refused in
whole or in part, or granted conditionally or on terms, may make a subsequent
application for the same order upon new or different facts, circumstances, or
law, in which case it shall be shown by affidavit what application was made
before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new
or different facts circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown. For a failure
to comply with this subdivision, any order made on a subsequent application may
be revoked or set aside on an ex parte motion.
 
…
 
(e)
This section specifies the court’s jurisdiction with regard to applications for
reconsideration of its orders and renewals of previous motions, and applies to
all applications to reconsider any order of a judge or court, or for the
renewal of a previous motion, whether the order deciding the previous matter or
motion is interim or final. No application to reconsider any order or for the
renewal of a previous motion may be considered by any judge or court unless
made according to this section.”
 
(Code
Civ. Proc. § 1008(a), (b), (e).)
 
A
motion for reconsideration under § 1008 requires that the moving party present
new or different facts that were not previously considered by the Court.  (New York Times Co. v. Superior Court
(2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212-13.) 
However, the burden under § 1008 “is comparable to that of a party
seeking a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence: the information
must be such that the moving party could not, with reasonable diligence, have
discovered or produced it at the trial.” 
(Ibid.; Even Zohar Construction & Remodeling, Inc. v.
Bellaire Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 830, 833 [finding that § 1008
imposes the special requirement of having to not only show new or different
facts, circumstances, or law, but also to “show diligence with a satisfactory
explanation for not presenting the new or different information
earlier…”].)  Reconsideration cannot be granted based on claims that the
court misinterpreted the law in its initial ruling because this is not a
"new" or "different" matter.  (Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32
Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.)
 
III.           
Discussion
 
Having reviewed Petitioner’s Motion
filed on May 30, 2023, the Court made the following findings at the August 14,
2023, hearing.  (8-14-23 Minute Order.)
 
First, the Notice of Motion does not contain the address or
name of the courthouse where the hearing on the Motion will take place, as
required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1110(b).
 
Second, the Court has not received
any evidence that Viele was scheduled for a deposition on May 10, 2023, as
suggested by Petitioner.
 
            Third,
Petitioner does not make an adequate showing that the Court violated Family
Code § 70(b).  Section § 70(b)
states that “[i]n determining the date of separation, the court shall take into
consideration all relevant evidence.” 
(Family Code § 70(b).)  Petitioner
does not put forth any new or different evidence to show that the Court
violated this section.
 
Although the Court was inclined to
deny the Motion due to these deficiencies, the Court noted that non-party Viele
had not complied with the Court’s May 10, 2023, Order in submitting evidence of
the date of separation, within twenty (20) days of notice of the Court’s
Order.  (8-14-23 Minute Order.)  For this reason, the Court continued the
hearing on Petitioner’s Motion.  (Ibid.)
 
On August 28, 2023, Petitioner
filed a declaration presenting facts regarding Viele’s separation.
 
            The Court
notes that Petitioner’s declaration does not correct any of the deficiencies
previously found in the Motion. 
Petitioner has reserved another hearing to be heard on his November 28,
2022, motion for reconsideration and continues to argue that the Court has
misapplied and misinterpreted the law. 
Petitioner does not present any new or different facts in order for the
Court to reconsider its May 10, 2023, Order. 
Petitioner had a chance to review the tentative ruling prior to the
hearing on the Motion and to argue his case before the Court, and was later
served with the final ruling by the Clerk on May 22, 2023.
 
Accordingly, the Court does not
find that Petitioner has presented any basis for the Court to grant the relief
he seeks through this Motion.  Accordingly,
the Court DENIES Petitioner’s Motion for Reconsideration, filed on May 30,
2023.
 
IV.           
Conclusion
& Order
 
For the foregoing reasons,
 
The Motion for Reconsideration, filed by
Petitioner Joseph L. Shalant on May 30, 2023, is DENIED.
 
Petitioner is ordered to
give notice.
