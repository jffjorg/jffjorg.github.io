The court has ruled on the motion to compel HGL Restaurant Group, LLC's answer to interrogatory number 5. The plaintiff, Richard Dahl, filed a motion to compel HGL's response to the interrogatory, alleging that HGL failed to respond to the discovery request. The court found that HGL's failure to respond was due to an administrative error, and not a misuse of the discovery process. The court denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, finding that HGL acted with substantial justification and the imposition of sanctions would be unjust. The court also placed the motion to compel off calendar as moot, since HGL has properly served the response to the interrogatory and the plaintiff has confirmed receipt.
