The judge is considering a motion to set aside a dismissal and enter judgment in a case between State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (plaintiff) and Esdras C. Mestanza aka Esdras N. Mestanza Chicas (defendant). The case was dismissed on December 6, 2022, with the parties agreeing to the dismissal in a stipulation. However, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant breached the stipulation by failing to make monthly payments.

The judge finds that the stipulation complies with California Code of Civil Procedure § 664.6 and that the court retained jurisdiction to enter judgment upon breach. The plaintiff requests that the court enter judgment for $12,336.78, which includes the principal amount of $16,108.21, less $4,298.08 in payments made by the defendant's insurance carrier, plus filing costs and lawsuit filing fees.

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion and vacates the dismissal entered on December 6, 2022. Judgment is entered for the plaintiff and against the defendant in the amount of $12,336.78.

## English Text Summary:

The judge is recommending that the case be decided in favor of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (Plaintiff). 

The Plaintiff is seeking to recover $8,798.08 from the Defendant, Esdras C. Mestanza,  for damages they paid to one of their insured individuals after a car accident caused by the Defendant. The parties had previously agreed to dismiss the case and settle for this amount, with the Defendant's insurance company paying part of it and the Defendant paying the rest in monthly installments. 

However, the Defendant failed to make any of the agreed-upon payments and did not respond to a default notice sent by the Plaintiff. 

Because of this breach of the settlement agreement, the judge is recommending that the case be reopened and a judgment be entered in favor of the Plaintiff for the full amount of $12,336.78, which includes the original settlement amount, filing fees, and other costs.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is in response to the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case and enter judgment against the defendant. The case involves an automobile collision between the defendant and an individual insured by the plaintiff's automobile insurance policy. The plaintiff compensated the insured for damages and then filed the instant claim against the defendant for allegedly causing the damages.

The defendant and the plaintiff signed a stipulation for entry of judgment, which provided that the defendant would pay $8,798.08 to the plaintiff. However, the defendant failed to make the payments, and the plaintiff filed a motion to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment against the defendant.

The judge finds that the stipulation complies with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure § 664.6 and that the court has retained jurisdiction to enter judgment pursuant to the parties' stipulation. The judge also finds that the stipulation is valid and enforceable under the same statute.

As a result, the judge grants the plaintiff's motion and enters judgment against the defendant in the amount of $12,336.78, which includes the original damages, filing fees, and lawsuit filing fees. The judge also vacates the dismissal of the case and orders the defendant to pay the judgment.

The court finds that the stipulation agreement is valid and enforceable, and that the plaintiff has provided evidence of the defendant's breach. Therefore, the court has entered judgment for the plaintiff and against the defendant in the amount of $12,336.78. The dismissal entered on December 6, 2022, is vacated, and the court has ordered the moving party to give notice.
