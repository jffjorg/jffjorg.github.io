And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering a motion to set aside a dismissal and enter judgment in a case between State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (plaintiff) and Esdras C. Mestanza aka Esdras N. Mestanza Chicas (defendant). The case was dismissed on December 6, 2022, with the parties agreeing to the dismissal in a stipulation. However, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant breached the stipulation by failing to make monthly payments.

The judge finds that the stipulation complies with California Code of Civil Procedure ยง 664.6 and that the court retained jurisdiction to enter judgment upon breach. The plaintiff requests that the court enter judgment for $12,336.78, which includes the principal amount of $16,108.21, less $4,298.08 in payments made by the defendant's insurance carrier, plus filing costs and lawsuit filing fees.

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion and vacates the dismissal entered on December 6, 2022. Judgment is entered for the plaintiff and against the defendant in the amount of $12,336.78.
