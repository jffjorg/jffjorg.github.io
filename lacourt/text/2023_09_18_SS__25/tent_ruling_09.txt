 Case Number:  23STCP00652    Hearing Date:   September 18, 2023    Dept:  25  Michael Sanders, et al. v. Oren Badler, et al. 23stcp00652ANALYSIS:   I.                 Background   On May 24, 2022, Arbitrator Kathy  Vodges, Esq. issued an arbitration award in the amount of $25,000 for  Petitioners Michael Sanders (“Sanders”) and Trisha Atkinson (“Atkinson”) and  against Respondents Oren Badler (“Balder”) and OB Floors, Inc. (“OB”), (collectively  “Respondents”).  (Pet. pp. 7-11;  Pet. ¶¶ 6-8.)   On March 1, 2023, Petitioners, in propria persona, filed  the instant Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award (“Petition”) against  Respondents.             On June 16, 2023, Petitioner Sanders  filed a Request to Postpone Trial in the form of a sworn declaration,  indicating that he had “to travel out of the country to act as a personal  caregiver and power of attorney for an ailing parent.”  (6-16-23 Request to Postpone Trial.)               On June 27, 2023, Petitioner Sanders  filed proof that Respondents were served with the Petition and Notice of  Hearing.               On July 5, 2023, the Court noted  that the Petition listed the Van Nuys Courthouse East address, instead of the  address for the Spring Street Courthouse.   (7-5-23 Minute Order.)  Pursuant  to the request of Petitioner Sanders, the Court continued the hearing to August  16, 2023, and ordered the moving party to give notice.  (Ibid.)               On August 16, 2023, the Court  continued the hearing on the Petition because there was no indication that  Petitioner had served Respondents with a notice of continuance.  (8-16-23 Minute Order.)  The Court gave notice to Petitioner Sanders  and Respondent Badler.  (8-16-23  Certificate of Mailing.)   No opposition has been filed.   II.               Legal  Standard   Once  arbitration is concluded, “any arbitrator’s award is enforceable only when  confirmed as a judgment of the superior court.”   (O’Hare v. Municipal Resource Consultants (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th  267, 278.).  Any of the parties may file a  petition with the court, which must then “confirm the award, correct and  confirm it, vacate it, or dismiss the petition.”  (Code of Civil Proc. §§ 1285,  1286; EHM  Productions, Inc. v. Starline Tours of Hollywood, Inc. (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.)  “It is well settled that the scope of judicial review  of arbitration awards is extremely narrow.”  (California  Faculty Assn. v. Superior Court (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 935, 943.)  “Neither the  trial court, nor the appellate court, may ‘review the merits of the dispute,  the sufficiency of the evidence, or the arbitrator’s reasoning, nor may we  correct or review an award because of an arbitrator’s legal or factual error,  even if it appears on the award’s face.”   (EHM Productions, supra, at p.  1063-64.)   Code of Civil Procedure, § 1285.4  states: “A petition under this chapter shall:   (a)   Set forth the substance of or have  attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the  existence of such an agreement. (b)   Set forth the names of the  arbitrators. (c)   Set forth or have attached a copy of  the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any. Moreover, Code of Civil Procedure §  1283.6 provides that: “The neutral  arbitrator shall serve a signed  copy of the award on each party to the arbitration personally or by registered  or certified mail or as provided in the agreement.”  (Emphasis added.)  In addition, a party may seek a court  judgment confirming an arbitration award by filing and serving a petition no  more than four years, but not less than 10 days, after the award is served.  (Code  Civ. Proc.  §§ 1288, 1288.4.)   Finally, Code of Civil Procedure §  1290.4, the statute governing proper service of this Petition states, in  pertinent part:    “(a) A copy of the petition and a written notice of the time and place  of the hearing thereof and any other papers upon which the petition is based shall be served in the manner provided  in the arbitration agreement for the service of such petition and notice.   (b) If  the arbitration agreement does not provide the manner in which such service  shall be made and the person upon whom service is to be made has not previously  appeared in the proceeding and has not previously been served in accordance  with this subdivision: ¶ (1) Service within this State shall be made in the  manner provided by law for the service of summons in an action.   III.             Discussion   On July 5, 2023, the Court noted that the Petition listed  the Van Nuys Courthouse East address, instead of the address for the Spring  Street Courthouse.  (7-5-23 Minute  Order.)  Pursuant to the request of  Petitioner Sanders, the Court continued the hearing to August 16, 2023, and  ordered the moving party to give notice.   (Ibid.)               Given that on March 19, 2023, Petitioners  served the Court’s Notice of Hearing on Petition, listing the correct address  for the Spring Street Courthouse, the Court waives the erroneous address on the  Petition.               On August 16, 2023, the Court  continued the hearing on the Petition because there was no indication that  Petitioner had served Respondents with a notice of continuance.  (8-16-23 Minute Order.)  The Court gave notice to Petitioner Sanders  and Respondent Badler.  (8-16-23  Certificate of Mailing.)               The Court proceeds with ruling on  the Petition.               Petitioner has attached a Home  Improvement Contract entered into between Petitioner Sanders and  Respondent.  (Pet. p. 5.)  The Court notes that Petitioner has submitted  an unclear copy of the Contract that is difficult to discern.  There is an initialed box on the contract  indicating that the parties agree to arbitration; however, this provision  refers to the “Arbitration of Disputes” section which is not attached.  (Ibid.)               Petitioner has also filed a  FairClaims Post-Dispute Arbitration Agreement and a FairClaims Arbitration  Award issued by Arbitrator Kathy Vogdes Esq.   (Pet. pp. 4, 6-11.)  The Court  notes that Petitioner has not presented any evidence that a neutral arbitrator  served a copy of the Award on the parties.               On June 27, 2023, Petitioners served  Respondents with the Petition, Notice of Hearing, and supporting documents via  personal service.  The Court finds that  the service requirement has been met.               Although Petitioners have complied  with most of the requirements for the instant Petition, the Court finds it  difficult to review the copy of the Home Improvement Contract attached.  Thus, the Court orders Petitioners to file a  clear copy of the Home Improvement Contract, along with the “Arbitration of  Disputes” attachment.               For this reason, the hearing on the  Petition is continued.   IV.             Conclusion  & Order   For the foregoing reasons,   The hearing on the Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award, filed by  Petitioners Michael Sanders, et al.’s, is CONTINUED to OCTOBER 24, 2023 at 10:00 A.M. in Department 25 at Spring Street Courthouse.  At least sixteen (16) court  days before the next scheduled hearing, Petitioners must file the supplemental  papers noted herein.  Failure to do so may result in  the Petition being placed off calendar or denied.   Moving party is ordered to give  notice.
