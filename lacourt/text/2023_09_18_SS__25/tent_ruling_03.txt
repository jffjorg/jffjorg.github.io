 Case Number:  21STLC00297    Hearing Date:   September 18, 2023    Dept:  25  State  Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Jose Oswaldo Garcia 21stlc00297ANALYSIS:   I.                 Background               On  January 12, 2021, Plaintiff  State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”)  filed an action against Defendant Jose Oswaldo Garcia (“Defendant” or “Garcia”)  for subrogation, stemming from an automobile collision between Defendant, on  the one hand, and an individual insured by Plaintiff’s automobile insurance  policy, on the other hand.  (Compl.)  Plaintiff compensated the insured for claimed damages  in the amount of $13,616.20 and filed the instant claim against Defendant for  allegedly causing the damages.  (Ibid.  pp. 2-3.)              On August 20, 2021, Defendant filed an  Answer to the Complaint.              On November 3, 2022, the Court was  informed that the matter had settled and placed trial off calendar.  (11-3-22 Minute Order.)              On February 28, 2023, Plaintiff  filed a Stipulation for Dismissal with a Reservation of Jurisdiction to Vacate  Dismissal and Enter Judgment in the Event of Default, signed by both parties, to  dismiss the action on the premise that Defendant would compensate Plaintiff for  the settlement amount of $10,761.61.  (2-28-23  Stipulation.)  On March 22, 2023, the  Court dismissed the entire case without prejudice pursuant to the Stipulation.  (3-22-23 Order.)  On June 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed the  instant Motion to Set Aside Dismissal and Enter Judgment (“Motion”).   No opposition has been filed.   II.               Legal  Standard & Discussion   CCP § 664.6, provides a summary  procedure that enables judges to enforce a settlement agreement by entering a  judgment pursuant to the terms of the parties’ settlement.  In particular, the statute provides:   (a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a  writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally  before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon  motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.  If requested by the parties, the court may  retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until  performance in full of the terms of the settlement.   (b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed by a  party if it is signed by any of the following:   (1) The party. (2) An attorney who represents the party. (3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is authorized  in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer's behalf.   CCP §  664.6(a)-(b) (emphasis added).      III.             Discussion  A. Retention of Jurisdiction   “‘[V]oluntary dismissal of an  action or special proceeding terminates the court’s jurisdiction over the  matter.’  (Conservatorship of Martha  P. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 857, 867) [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 142.) ‘If requested  by the parties,’ however, ‘the [trial] court may retain jurisdiction over  the parties to enforce [a] settlement until performance in full of the terms of  the settlement.’ (§ 664.6, italics added.)”   (Mesa RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles (2019) 33  Cal.App.5th 913, 917.)  “‘Because of its  summary nature, strict compliance with the requirements of section 664.6 is  prerequisite to invoking the power of the court to impose a settlement  agreement.’”  (Ibid. (quoting Sully-Miller  Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103  Cal.App.4th 30, 37).)   “A request for the trial court to  retain jurisdiction under section 664.6 ‘must conform to the same three  requirements which the Legislature and the courts have deemed necessary for  section 664.6 enforcement of the settlement itself: the request must be made  (1) during the pendency of the case, not after the case has been dismissed in  its entirety, (2) by the parties themselves, and (3) either in a writing signed  by the parties or orally before the court.’”   (Ibid. (quoting Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th  429, 440).)  “The ‘request must be  express, not implied from other language, and it must be clear and  unambiguous.’” (Ibid. (quoting Wackeen, supra, 97 Cal.App.4th at  440).)   Here, the parties signed a Stipulation  for Dismissal with a Reservation of Jurisdiction to Vacate Dismissal and Enter  Judgment in the Event of Default (“Stipulation”) containing the parties’  agreement for the Court to retain jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil  Procedure §664.6 to enforce the terms of the stipulation and enter judgment in  the event of default.  (2-28-23 Stipulation  ¶ 1.)  Prior to the dismissal of this  action, the Stipulation was signed by the parties and submitted to the  Court.  (Ibid. at pp. 3-4.)  On March 22, 2023, the Court dismissed the  entire case without prejudice pursuant to the Stipulation and expressly stated  that it “RETAINS JURISDICTION OF THIS CASE IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND PURSUANT TO  CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 664.6.”  (3-22-23 Order.)   The Court finds that the  Stipulation complies with § 664.6 requirements and the Court has retained  jurisdiction to enter judgment pursuant to the parties’ Stipulation in this  action.   B. Entry of Judgment   The Stipulation Agreement filed on February  28, 2023, provides that Plaintiff and Defendant agreed to dismiss the action on  the premise that Defendant would compensate Plaintiff for the settlement amount  of $10,761.61.  (2-28-23 Stipulation ¶ 2.)  Pursuant to the Stipulation, Defendant’s  insurance carrier would make a payment of $5,961.61 and Defendant would pay the  remaining balance of $4,800 with $200 monthly payments commencing on February  15, 2023, and continuing until the balance is paid in full.  (Ibid. at ¶ 2a-b.)  All parties signed the Stipulation.  (Ibid. at pp. 3-4.)   The Stipulation also provides that Defendant  will have a fifteen (15) day grace period to make payments.  (Ibid. at ¶ 8.)  In the event Defendant fails to make  payments, Plaintiff will provide written notice of default and Defendant will  have an additional ten (10) days to cure the default.  (Ibid.)  If Defendant does not cure the default, “plaintiff  may cause judgment to be entered for the settlement amount set forth in this  agreement, after crediting payments that have been made at that time.”  (Ibid. at ¶ 6.)  If Defendant’s contact information changes, he  is responsible for providing written notice to Plaintiff, otherwise Plaintiff  will send the notice of default to the address indicated in the Stipulation.  (Ibid. at ¶ 8.)   On June 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed the  instant Motion alleging that Defendant breached the Stipulation.  (Mot. pp. 1-2.)   Plaintiff’s counsel, Susan M.  Benson, states that Defendant’s insurance carrier made a payment of $5,961.51.  (Benson Decl. ¶ 5.)  Defendant did not make any payments.  (Ibid.)  On March 28, 2023, counsel sent a default  notice to Defendant to pay the remaining sum of $4,800.10.  (Ibid. at ¶ 6, Ex. 2.)  However, Defendant has not made any payments.  (Ibid. at ¶ 7.)  Thus, Plaintiff requests that the Court enter  judgment for Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $4,872.10 as  follows: principal amount of $10,761.61, less $5,961.51 in payments made by Defendant’s  insurance carrier, plus motion filing fees of $72.  (Ibid. at ¶ 8.)   The Court finds the Stipulation to be  valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Proc. § 664.6.  Plaintiff provides evidence that Defendant did  not make any monthly payments and did not respond to Plaintiff’s written notice  of default.  Thus, a valid  and signed stipulation agreement was breached and the Court retained  jurisdiction to enter judgment upon breach.   Furthermore, Plaintiff has filed proof  that the moving papers were served on Defendant by mail on June 26, 2023.  (Mot. p. 13.)   However, it appears that defense counsel’s address, listed on the Proof  of Service, is not consistent with defense counsel’s address listed on the  Answer.  Accordingly, the Court continues  the hearing on the Motion and orders Plaintiff to verify that defense counsel  has been properly served with the moving papers at the correct address.   IV.             Conclusion  & Order   For the foregoing reasons,  Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company’s Motion to Set  Aside Dismissal and Enter Judgment is CONTINUED to October 25, 2023 at  10:00 a.m. in Department 25 at Spring Street Courthouse.  Plaintiff is ordered to file supplemental  papers as discussed herein at least sixteen (16) court days before the  scheduled hearing.  Failure to do so may  result in the hearing being placed off calendar or denied.   Moving party is ordered to  give notice.
