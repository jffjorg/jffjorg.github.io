CASE:                                State of California v. Arnoldo Rodriguez
 
CASE NO.:                 21STCV40586
 





















 
MOTION
TO CONTINUE TRIAL



 
MOVING PARTY:                   Plaintiff
the State of California
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            This is a consolidated action arising out of a motor vehicle
accident. At the time of the incident, Plaintiff Maria Sacramento Hernandez
Luna, a caregiver employed by the State, was on a work errand. As a result of
this incident, Hernandez Luna sustained injuries and damages for which the
State has paid workers compensation benefits that it is seeking to recover in
this action. The State filed its complaint on November 3, 2021, and Hernandez
Luna filed her complaint on November 12, 2021. The actions were consolidated on
June 13, 2022.
 
On January 5, 2024, the State filed this motion to continue
the trial date and to set all related cutoff dates to the new trial date.  This is the third request for a trial
continuance.
 
            The motion
is unopposed.
 
II.           LEGAL STANDARD TO CONTINUE TRIAL
California Rules of Court, rule
3.1332, subdivision (b) outlines that “a party seeking a continuance of the
date set for trial, whether contested or uncontested or stipulated to by the
parties, must make the request for a continuance by a noticed motion or an ex
parte application under the rules in chapter 4 of this division, with
supporting declarations.  The party must make the motion or application as
soon as reasonably practical once the necessity for the continuance is
discovered.” 
Under California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1332, subd. (c), the Court may grant a continuance only on an
affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance.  Circumstances that may indicate good cause
include “a party’s excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents,
or other material evidence despite diligent efforts.”  The Court should
consider all facts and circumstances relevant to the determination, such as
proximity of the trial date, prior continuances, prejudice suffered, whether all
parties have stipulated to a continuance, and whether the interests of justice
are served.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subd. (d).) 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            Counsel for
the State argues good cause exists to continue the trial date and to set all
related dates to the new trial date because counsel has a prepaid vacation that
conflicts with the current trial date. 
 
            Counsel
declares that he was not notified when Defendants filed the previous motion to
continue trial, and therefore could not timely object to an April 8, 2024
continuance date. (Stoll Decl., ¶6.) The current trial date falls in the middle
of counsel’s pre-paid family trip to Japan. (Id., ¶7.)
 
            All parties
are agreeable to a trial continuance. Counsel for co-plaintiff Hernandez Luna suggested
a trial continuance to mid-May 2024. (Id., Exh. 3.) Counsel for
defendant is agreeable to a continuance so long as it is not in “June to July
or November to December” 2024. (Id.)
 
            Counsel for
the State declares that he has trials set for May 21, August 26, September 4,
and September 9, 2024. (Id., ¶7.) 
 
Based on the parties’ availability, counsel for the State
requests a trial continuance to early to mid-August 2024 or mid-September to
October 2024.
            
            The Court
finds good cause exists to continue the trial date and all related dates. As
this motion is unopposed, the Court finds no prejudice will result from granting
this motion. 
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
The unopposed motion to continue trial is GRANTED.  The Final Status Conference scheduled for March
25, 2024 is CONTINUED to ___FATD
8/1/24_____ at 10:00 AM in Department 27 of the Spring Street
Courthouse.  The Non-Jury Trial scheduled
for April 8, 2024 is CONTINUED to ________ at 8:30 AM in Department 27 of the Spring Street
Courthouse.  All discovery cut-off dates,
all pretrial deadlines including discovery, expert, and motion cut-off dates
are aligned with the new trial date.
 
Moving party to give notice.
