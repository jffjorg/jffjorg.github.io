And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Lee S. Arian has issued a tentative ruling granting the unopposed motion to continue the trial date in the case of Jose Alfredo Sanchez and Anareli Lizveth Arriaga v. Joseph Guilay Imatong and Uber Technologies, Inc. (Case No. 21STCV43862). The motion was filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. and joined by Defendant Joseph Guilay Imatong, seeking a six-month continuance of the trial date.

The motion is unopposed, and the Court finds good cause to continue the trial date due to Uber's need for additional time for discovery and Defendant Imatong's counsel needing additional time to review existing discovery. The Court also notes that the parties have stipulated to a continuance of the trial date.

The tentative ruling grants the motion to continue the trial date and all related dates, including the final status conference and non-jury trial. The new trial date is set for October 7, 2024, and all discovery cut-off dates, pretrial deadlines, and motion cut-off dates are aligned with the new trial date. The moving party is ordered to give notice of the new trial date.
