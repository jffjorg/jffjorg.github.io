MOTION
TO CONTINUE TRIAL



 
MOVING PARTY:                   Defendant
Uber Technologies, Inc., joined by Defendant Joseph Guilay Imatong
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            This is an action arising out of a motor vehicle accident. Plaintiffs
Jose Alfredo Sanchez and Anareli Lizveth Arriaga filed the complaint on
December 1, 2021 against Defendant Joseph Guilay Imatong (“Imatong”) and Does
1-50. On October 11, 2023, Plaintiffs filed an amendment to the complaint
designating Doe 1 as Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber”).
 
Uber filed this motion to continue trial for six months on January
8, 2024. Imatong filed a notice of joinder on January 12. 
 
            The motion
is unopposed, but Uber declares that Plaintiffs’ counsel refused to agree to
another continuance. (Bonoli Decl. ¶8.)
 
II.           LEGAL STANDARD TO CONTINUE TRIAL
California Rules of Court, rule
3.1332, subdivision (b) outlines that “a party seeking a continuance of the
date set for trial, whether contested or uncontested or stipulated to by the
parties, must make the request for a continuance by a noticed motion or an ex
parte application under the rules in chapter 4 of this division, with
supporting declarations.  The party must make the motion or application as
soon as reasonably practical once the necessity for the continuance is
discovered.” 
Under California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1332, subd. (c), the Court may grant a continuance only on an
affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance.  Circumstances that may indicate good cause
include “a party’s excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents,
or other material evidence despite diligent efforts.”  The Court should
consider all facts and circumstances relevant to the determination, such as
proximity of the trial date, prior continuances, prejudice suffered, whether all
parties have stipulated to a continuance, and whether the interests of justice
are served.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subd. (d).) 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            Uber argues
that good cause exists to continue the trial date because Uber was brought into
the case only six months before the current trial date, and as such, requires
additional time to conduct discovery. Uber requests a six-month continuance of
the trial date, final status conference and related deadlines. 
 
Uber was named as a defendant in this action almost two
years after it was filed, and only two months before the initial trial date of
December 12, 2023. (Bonoli Decl., ¶3, Exh. B.) Trial was subsequently continued
from December 12, 2023 to April 18, 2024 by stipulation of the parties, but
before Uber appeared in this matter. Uber argues that it needs additional time
to review existing medical records, take depositions and propound additional
discovery. (Id., ¶6.) Uber alleges that “if the trial continuance is not
granted, it will be unable to marshal any evidence in its defense and will be
forced to blindly participate in a trial less than six months after it first
appeared in this action.” (Id., ¶10.) Uber also alleges that continuance
will give the parties a chance to engage in meaningful settlement discussions.
(Mtn., 3:4-7, 7:1-4.)
 
Imatong joined in this motion because his current counsel,
who was substituted on December 20, 2023, needs additional time to review
existing discovery, complete additional discovery, retain experts and
coordinate trial preparation with co-defense counsel. (Bell Decl., ¶¶2-4.)
            
            The Court
finds good cause exists to continue the trial date and all related dates. As
this motion is unopposed, the Court finds no prejudice will result from
granting this motion. 
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
The unopposed motion to continue trial is GRANTED.  The Final Status Conference scheduled for April,
2024 is CONTINUED to __FATD
10/7/24______ at 10:00 AM in Department 27 of the Spring Street
Courthouse.  The Non-Jury Trial scheduled
for April 18, 2024 is CONTINUED to ________ at 8:30 AM in Department 27 of the Spring Street
Courthouse.  All discovery cut-off dates,
all pretrial deadlines including discovery, expert, and motion cut-off dates
are aligned with the new trial date.
 
Moving party to give notice.
