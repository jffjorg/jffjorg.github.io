And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge is unclear why Mr. Cantor, an attorney from Wolf & Wyman, brought a motion to be relieved, when it was Mr. Shen, also from Wolf & Wyman, who signed the substitution of attorney for the case. However, the Judge notes that the Court allows members of the same firm to appear as counsel without needing to file an association or substitution of counsel, citing a previous case. Therefore, the Judge will consider the Motion to be made on behalf of the Wolf & Wyman firm and Mr. Shen, although it would have been clearer if Mr. Shen had simply filed the motion.
