And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer of the defendants as to the third cause of action in the First Amended Complaint, with leave to amend. The ruling also grants the motion to strike, but denies the request to grant the motion without leave to amend.

The plaintiff, Alejandra Quintero, alleges that she was injured at a restaurant owned by the defendants, Perch Restaurant, JMF Enterprises V LLC, JMF Pershing Square LLC, and Citrus Hospitality Management. The defendants filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that the third cause of action, which alleges products liability, fails to state a cause of action.

The court finds that the plaintiff's allegations do not establish that the defendants manufactured, distributed, or sold the allegedly defective product, and therefore, strict products liability cannot be imposed on the restaurant owners. The court also strikes the allegations of punitive damages, finding that they are not specific enough to support a claim for punitive damages.

The court orders the moving party to give notice and invites parties who intend to submit on the tentative to send an email to the court. The court will adopt the tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar if no objections are received.
