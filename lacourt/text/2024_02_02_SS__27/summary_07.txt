This is a tentative ruling by Judge Lee S. Arian in the case Scott Harber v. City of Santa Monica (Case No. 22STCV02016). The case is a personal injury lawsuit filed by Scott Harber, who was injured while riding a bicycle after hitting a metal stub protruding from the roadway. The City of Santa Monica is the defendant.

The defendant has filed a motion for leave to file an amended answer to raise an additional defense, specifically Government Code section 831.4's trail immunity provision. The plaintiff opposes this motion.

The judge has considered the legal standards for granting or denying leave to amend a pleading and has decided to grant the defendant's motion. The judge has based this decision on the defendant's valid explanations for the delay in seeking leave to amend and the lack of prejudice to the plaintiff.

The judge orders the defendant to file an amended answer within 5 court days. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit as directed by the court's instructions.
