[1] The Court is unclear
why the motion to be relieved is brought by Mr. Cantor when Mr. Shen was the attorney
who signed the substitution of attorney coming into the case.Â  However, given that both Mr. Cantor and Mr.
Shen are part of the Wolf & Wyman firm and the court allows members of the
same firm to appear as counsel of record without the need to file an association
or substitution of counsel (see Ellis Law Group, LLP v. Nevada City
Sugar Loaf Properties, LLC (2014), 230 Cal. App. 4th 244, 258),
the Court will consider the Motion to be made on behalf of the Wolf & Wyman
firm and Mr. Shen, albeit it would certainly be more clear and obviate the need
for this this footnote if Mr. Shen had simply filed the motion, assuming he is
able to do so.
