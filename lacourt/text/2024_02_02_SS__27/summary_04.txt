The court has issued a tentative ruling in favor of the plaintiff, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, in the amount of $16,055.69. The ruling grants the motion to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant, Max Alexander Infante, had stipulated to a settlement agreement, which included installment payments of $75.00 per month. However, the defendant failed to make the required payments, and the plaintiff is seeking judgment in the amount of $26,764.69, less the payments received, for a total principal of $15,983.69, plus filing costs of $72.00. The court has retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement and has found that the defendant has breached the agreement, thereby justifying the entry of judgment in favor of the plaintiff.
