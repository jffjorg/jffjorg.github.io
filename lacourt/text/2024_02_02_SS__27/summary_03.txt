And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendant's motion for an undertaking, requiring the non-resident plaintiff to file an undertaking in the amount of $30,000 within 30 days. The defendant has shown a reasonable possibility of prevailing at trial, based on a photograph indicating minimal damage to the plaintiff's vehicle and a $150,000 offer for settlement. The judge finds that the defendant is likely to be owed attorney's fees and costs that exceed any damage award to the plaintiff.
