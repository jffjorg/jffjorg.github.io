RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Stephen Harris (“Plaintiff”)
 
 
 
I.           
INTRODUCTION
This
action arises from a motor vehicle accident which occurred on November 28,
2016. On October 19, 2018, Plaintiff Stephen Harris (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Defendants Jack Swank (“Decedent”) and Does 1 through 100,
alleging a single cause of action for negligence.  
On
November 20, 2018, Decedent filed and served an answer to the complaint. 
On
February 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for an order substituting Judith
Lorraine Swank (“Swank”) as a defendant in this action due to the death of Decedent.
On June 22, 2023, the Honorable Michelle C. Kim, sitting in Department 31 of
this Court, denied Plaintiff’s motion to substitute Swank in place of Decedent
without prejudice. 
On
May 25, 2023, Decedent filed a motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff’s
experts. 
On
June 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to substitute Swank in place of Decedent
and, on August 29, 2023, the Honorable Michelle C. Kim, sitting in Department
31 of this Court, granted Plaintiff’s motion. The Court ordered Plaintiff to
serve Swank with an amended complaint within 20 days. (08/29/23 Minute Order.) 
On
August 17, 2023, the Court held a Final Status Conference and, pursuant to oral
stipulation, continued the scheduled August 31, 2023 jury trial to October 9,
2023. 
On
September 19, 2023, after hearing oral argument and taking the matter under
submission on September 18, 2023, the Honorable Michelle C. Kim, sitting in
Department 31 of this Court, granted Decedent’s motion to compel the
depositions of Plaintiff’s experts. (09/19/23 Minute Order.) The Court granted
Decedent’s request to compel the depositions of Steven Dunbar, D.C. and Babak
Samimi, M.D. (Id.) The Court, however, denied Decedent’s request for
sanctions on the grounds that the notice of motion did not specify the type of
sanction sought. (Id.) On September 20, 2023, Swank filed and served a
Notice of Ruling as to the Court’s September 19, 2023 order. 
 
Plaintiff’s Appeal and Subsequent Procedural History
On
October 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed and served a Notice of Appeal which merely
states that Plaintiff was appealing the collateral order doctrine (the “1d
Notice”). The 1d Notice did not include the date the purported order was
entered.
On
October 3, 2023, Swank filed and served a peremptory challenge as to the
Honorable Michelle C. Kim, which was granted. This matter was then transferred
to Department 27 at the Spring Street Courthouse. 
On
October 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Swank
and Does 1 through 10, alleging a single cause of action for negligence. 
Also,
on October 5, 2023, the Court held a Final Status Conference where it indicated
that jury trial scheduled for October 9, 2023 was continued to December 15,
2023 and that “[d]iscovery is to remain closed.” (10/05/23 Minute Order.) 
On
October 25, 2023, Swank filed and served the instant motion for terminating
sanctions (the “Motion”) on the grounds that Plaintiff objected to the
depositions of Plaintiff’s experts in defiance of this Court’s September 19,
2023 order.[1]
The Motion also requests monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s
attorney of record In the sum of $2,614.86. 
On
October 27, 2023, Swank filed and served a Brief re: Plaintiff’s Notice of
Appeal. 
On
October 31, 2023, Plaintiff filed and served a Notice of Appeal (the “2d
Notice”), which indicates that Plaintiff is appealing the Court’s September 19,
2023 order. 
On
November 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Brief re: Stay Pending Appeal. 
On
November 20, 2023, Plaintiff purported to file an opposition to the Motion;
however, such filing only includes a caption page and does not contain a
memorandum of points and authorities or a declaration in support thereof. 
On
November 21, 2023, Swank filed a reply brief. 
On
November 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed an opposition brief to the Motion.
Plaintiff’s November 28, 2023 filing contains a memorandum of points and
authorities and a declaration in support thereof. Such opposition requests a
stay of this action pending appeal or a denial of the Motion.
On
December 1, 2023, the Second District Court of Appeal issued an order stating
that Plaintiff is in default and the appeal filed on October 2, 2023 was
dismissed. 
On
December 4, 2023, after hearing, the Court sustained Swank’s demurrer to the
FAC with leave to amend and ordered Plaintiff to file a Second Amended
Complaint. (12/04/23 Minute Order, p. 6.) The Court continued the hearing on
the Motion to January 24, 2024 due to the appeal of the Court’s September 19,
2023 order, and the Court did not rule on the Motion. (12/04/23 Minute Order,
p. 5.) The Court also set an OSC re: Should This Matter Be Stayed Due to the
Appeal for January 24, 2024. (12/04/23 Minute Order, p. 7.) The Court indicated
that “[c]ounsel for Plaintiff may file supplemental briefing in the event that
the matter is deemed not appealable at least seven court days before the next
hearing date.” (12/04/23 Minute Order, p. 7.) 
Also,
on December 4, 2023, Swank’s counsel filed a declaration re: the status of
Plaintiff’ s appeal. Counsel’s declaration states that on December 1, 2023, his
office received documents from the Court of Appeal showing that the Court of
Appeal has effectively dismissed the appeal. (Dewey Decl., ¶ 1; Exhibit A.)
Counsel declares that the Court of Appeal has indicated that the relief
Plaintiff is seeking is a non-appealable order. (Dewey Decl., ¶ 2; Exhibit B.) The
Court of Appeal requested that Plaintiff “demonstrate within 15 days of the
date of [the December 1, 2023] notice why the October 31, 2023 . . . appeal
should not be dismissed as having been taken from a nonappealable order.” (Dewey
Decl., ¶ 2; Exhibit B.) The Court of Appeal indicated that “[f]ailure by the
[Plaintiff] to respond within the time provided may result in the appeal being
dismissed as taken from a nonappealable order.” (Dewey Decl., ¶ 2; Exhibit B.) 
On
December 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative Second Amended Complaint
(“SAC”) against Swank and Does 1 through 10, alleging a single cause of action
for negligence. 
On
December 8, 2023, the Court held a Final Status Conference and, pursuant to
oral stipulation, continued jury trial from December 15, 2023 to February 26,
2024. (12/08/23 Minute Order.) The Court indicated that “[a]ll discovery and
related deadlines are continued to the new trial date.” (12/08/23 Minute
Order.) 
On
December 27, 2023, a Notice of Default was issued by the Clerk of this Court
indicating that Plaintiff’s appeal has been placed in default and will be
referred to the Court of Appeal for dismissal if Plaintiff does not correct the
deficiencies outlined therein—related to Reporter’s Transcripts—by January 11,
2024. 
On
January 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition to the Motion. The Court will
treat this filing as the operative opposition to the Motion. Plaintiff’s
earlier-filed opposition to the Motion merely requested a stay of this action
due to the pending appeal. 
On
January 11, 2024, after hearing oral argument, the Court continued the hearing
on Swank’s demurrer to the SAC to January 19, 2024, and stated that it would
allow counsel to submit supplemental briefing, which was to be filed no later
than January 16, 2024. 
On
January 17, 2024, Swank filed a reply brief concerning the Motion. The Court
will treat such filing as the operative reply brief. 
On
January 24, 2024, the Court, after issuing a tentative ruling on the Motion and
the demurrer and argument on the Demurrer, continued the Motion and the Demurrer
to today’s date for additional briefing. 

II.         
RULING
Based on the parties’ additional briefing,
the Court adopts its previous tentative and OVERRULES the demurrer.  Further, it denies the Motion for Terminating
Sanctions in its entirety because the pending appeal is still active and is intertwined
with the bases for the Motion.  The case,
however, is not stayed, as other aspects of the case can move forward without
being impacted by the appeal.
