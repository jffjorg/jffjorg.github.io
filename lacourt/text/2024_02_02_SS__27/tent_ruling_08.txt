I.       INTRODUCTION
          On April 15, 2022, Plaintiff Desirae
Pena (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants City of Los Angeles,
County of Los Angeles, California Department of Transportation, Los Angeles
County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Bird Rides, Inc., Segway Inc.,
and Does 1 to 50, alleging three causes of action: (1) premises liability, (2)
strict products liability, and (3) negligence. The complaint alleges that
Plaintiff incurred injuries and damages arising from an accident when riding a
motorized scooter in the City of Los Angeles on April 10, 2021. 
On March 20, 2023, Defendant City of
Los Angeles (the “City”) filed a Substitution of Attorney form. Michael H. Shen
of Wolfe & Wyman LLP was substituted in as the new counsel for the City,
replacing its former counsel.
On June 13, 2022, Plaintiff filed a
Request for Dismissal as to Defendant Bird Rides, Inc., which was subsequently
entered on June 15, 2022.
On September 6, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
Request for Dismissal as to Defendant Segway, Inc., which was subsequently
entered on September 7, 2023.
On January 9, 2023, Counsel Avery J.
Cantor (“Counsel”) filed the instant Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel for
Defendant City. [1]
 
II.      LEGAL
STANDARDS
The court may order that an attorney be
changed or substituted at any time before or after judgment or final
determination upon request by either client or attorney and after notice from
one to the other. (Code Civ. Proc., § 284(2).) “The determination whether to
grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion
of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 An application to be relieved as
counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and
Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1362(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(e)). The proposed order must specify all hearing dates scheduled in
the action or proceeding, including the date of trial, if known. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 Further, the requisite forms must
be served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the
case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay the
effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy
of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) A motion to withdraw will not be granted
where withdrawal would prejudice the client. 
(Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994)
21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
III.     DISCUSSION
Counsel has filed
completed forms MC-051 and MC-052, and has lodged with the Court a copy of the
proposed order on form MC-053 as required. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.)  Counsel states the instant motion is filed
for the following reason: “Attorney client relationship has been compromised
and a withdrawal of representation is necessary under California Rules of
Professional Conduct Section 3-700 (C) (f), non-payment of attorney fees and
expenses.” (MC-052.) This declaration suggests this is a permissive withdrawal.
(CRPC Rule 1.16(b)(4).) 
Defendant
City was served notice through mail at its last known address. Counsel declares
that he has confirmed within the past 30 days that the address is current by
verifying through Defendant City’s website. The Court finds this effort to be
reasonable.
The remaining
hearings in this matter include a Final Status Conference on May 20, 2024, and
a Non-Jury Trial on June 3, 2024.  There
is sufficient time for Defendant City to find its new counsel.  
Accordingly, the Court determines that
Counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel is GRANTED.
           
IV.     CONCLUSION
Defendant City of Los Angeles’
counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel is GRANTED upon filing of a proof of
service of this ruling on all parties.
 
Moving party to give notice.

that others might appear at the hearing to argue.  If the Court does not receive emails from the

appearances at the hearing, the Court may, at its discretion, adopt the
tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
