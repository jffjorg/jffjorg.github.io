And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the motion filed by Defendant City of Los Angeles' counsel, Michael H. Shen, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed due to a compromised attorney-client relationship, citing non-payment of attorney fees and expenses. The Court finds that there is sufficient time for Defendant City to find new counsel, and that Counsel's motion is granted. The hearing date for this matter is set for February 2, 2024.
