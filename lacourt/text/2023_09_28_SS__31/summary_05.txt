```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies Bird Rides, Inc.'s motion to dismiss the action for forum non conveniens. The court finds that Bird Rides has not met its burden to establish that Utah is a more convenient forum for the action. The court notes that Bird Rides' witnesses are not located in Utah and that California has an interest in regulating Bird Rides' company, which is headquartered and incorporated in California. The court also finds that Utah's statute of limitations does not apply to personal injury actions. The court therefore denies the motion and orders Bird Rides to give notice.
