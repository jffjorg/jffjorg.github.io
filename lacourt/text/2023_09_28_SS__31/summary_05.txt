The court notes that Bird Rides' witnesses are not located in Utah and that California has an interest in regulating Bird Rides' company, which is headquartered and incorporated in California. The court also finds that Utah's statute of limitations does not apply to personal injury actions. The court therefore denies the motion and orders Bird Rides to give notice.

## English Summary

The judge's tentative ruling denies Bird Rides' motion to dismiss the lawsuit filed by Steve Dixon on grounds of forum non conveniens. 

Bird Rides argued that the incident occurred in Utah and access to evidence and witnesses would be easier there. They also pointed to Utah's statute of limitations for personal injury claims.  

However, the judge found that while Utah does have a statute of limitations for personal injury claims, Bird Rides did not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that this would bar the action. Additionally, the judge determined that Bird Rides did not meet its burden of proving that Utah was a more convenient forum than California, considering factors like the location of Bird Rides' headquarters and the plaintiff's residence. The judge also noted the California court's interest in regulating a California-based company, even for incidents occurring outside the state.

The ruling suggests that the case will proceed in California.
