And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for terminating sanctions, which sought to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint or impose evidence sanctions for the plaintiff's failure to appear for his deposition. The judge found that while the plaintiff did not comply with the court's order to appear for his deposition, the deposition has since been rescheduled and has moved forward. The judge also noted that the defendants had not demonstrated that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules. As a result, the judge declined to impose terminating sanctions. The judge also denied the defendants' request for monetary sanctions, but ordered them to give notice. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement, and if not, to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
