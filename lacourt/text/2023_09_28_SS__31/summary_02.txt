And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for terminating sanctions, which sought to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint or impose evidence sanctions for the plaintiff's failure to appear for his deposition. The judge found that while the plaintiff did not comply with the court's order to appear for his deposition, the deposition has since been rescheduled and has moved forward. The judge also noted that the defendants had not demonstrated that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules. As a result, the judge declined to impose terminating sanctions. The judge also denied the defendants' request for monetary sanctions, but ordered them to give notice. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement, and if not, to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.

## English Text Summary

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for terminating sanctions filed by Defendants Julio Sanipatin and Hollywood Glass Co., Inc. against Plaintiff Ron York.  

The Defendants argue that Plaintiff failed to appear for his deposition despite a court order and that this constitutes willful disobedience warranting terminating sanctions, which could result in the dismissal of Plaintiff's case. 

Plaintiff argues that he was unable to attend the initial deposition date and that his counsel agreed to reschedule with Defense counsel. Plaintiff's counsel further states that they attempted to reschedule several times but received no response from Defense counsel.

The Judge notes that Plaintiff's deposition has since taken place, suggesting compliance with discovery rules. Therefore, the Judge denies Defendants' motion for terminating sanctions. The Judge also declines to award monetary sanctions at this time.

English text:
The Judge in this case has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion for terminating sanctions filed by the Defendants against the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff, Ron York, filed a complaint against the Defendants, Julio Sanipatin and Hollywood Glass Co., Inc., for damages arising from a motor vehicle accident. The Defendants moved for terminating sanctions against the Plaintiff for failing to appear for a deposition and not complying with the Court's order. The Plaintiff opposed the motion, and the Defendants filed a reply.

The Judge has considered the arguments presented by both parties and has determined that the Defendants have not demonstrated that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules. The Plaintiff's deposition has since moved forward, and the Judge has denied the Defendants' motion for terminating sanctions.

The Defendants also sought monetary sanctions in connection with the instant motion, but the Judge has declined to award them at this time. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If the parties do not submit or appear at the hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.
