And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion to compel a deposition. The plaintiff, Sandra Salvador, is seeking to compel the deposition of Michael Marquise Williams, an employee of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The defendant opposes the motion. The judge has denied the motion, finding that the plaintiff did not make sufficient efforts to reschedule or resume the deposition after the initial deposition was cut short. The judge also found that the defendant was willing and able to produce Williams for the deposition, but the parties did not continue discussing the deposition after a previous agreed-upon date. The judge did not award sanctions, as the plaintiff's motion was denied. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if they do not, they should appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
