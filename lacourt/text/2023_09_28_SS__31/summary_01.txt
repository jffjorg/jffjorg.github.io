## English Summary

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Defendant's employee, Michael Marquise Williams. 

The Plaintiff originally attempted to depose Williams, but the deposition was cut short due to time constraints. Plaintiff subsequently requested a second deposition, but Defendant opposed the motion, stating that they had tried to reschedule the deposition but were unable to reach Williams in February. They also argued that the Plaintiff did not inquire about rescheduling after refusing to proceed unless the Defendant produced footage from an inoperable exterior camera.

The judge found that both parties had opportunities to reschedule the deposition and ultimately failed to do so. The judge denied the motion to compel and did not impose sanctions on either party.  

Parties are encouraged to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement before the hearing.

The Court also declines to award sanctions.
