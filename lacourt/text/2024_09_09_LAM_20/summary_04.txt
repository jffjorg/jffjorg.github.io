And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in an employment action, in which the Defendant, Dart Warehouse Corporation, joined by Os4Labor LLC and Personnel Staffing Group, seeks to compel arbitration of the matter based on an arbitration agreement executed by the Plaintiff, Jessica Diaz, as a condition of her employment. The Plaintiff argues that there is not sufficient evidence of an agreement to arbitrate between the parties, the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) does not apply, several claims cannot be arbitrated due to the Employee Friendly Arbitration Act (EFAA), the subject arbitration agreement is unconscionable, and the representative PAGA claim should not be stayed. The Judge has ruled that the language of the delegation clause is clear and unmistakable and that the parties have voluntarily waived their right to have a court determine the enforceability of the agreement. The Judge has granted the Motion to Compel Arbitration and has stayed the action pending the resolution of the arbitration. The Judge has also ordered supplemental briefing on the issue of whether the delegation clause is clear and unmistakable, to be filed by August 30, 2024.
