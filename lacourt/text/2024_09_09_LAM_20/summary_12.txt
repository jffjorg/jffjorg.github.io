And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a lawsuit between Seneca Insurance Company, Inc. (Plaintiff) and Blackboard Specialty Insurance Company (Defendant). The Plaintiff filed a complaint alleging that the Defendant failed to provide coverage to their insured, Rafael Iryami, and that the Defendant's refusal to indemnify Iryami was in bad faith. The Defendant demurred to the complaint, arguing that the Plaintiff's claims fail because the parties are primary carriers and the Plaintiff did not pay a loss for which it was not primarily liable. The judge rejected the demurrer, ruling that the Plaintiff's claims are plausible and that the Defendant's arguments are meritless.

The judge also denied the Defendant's motion to strike the Plaintiff's request for attorneys' fees, ruling that such fees may be available for a bad faith claim. Additionally, the judge granted the Plaintiff's application for pro hac vice admission for Tyler W. Thull, a lawyer from out of state. The judge ordered that the Defendant file an answer to the complaint within 20 days and that any further motions or disputes be resolved through written submissions rather than in-person appearances due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
