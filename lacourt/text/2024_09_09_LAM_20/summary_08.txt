This tentative ruling addresses a motion to compel further responses to requests for production and special interrogatories filed by Plaintiff Tom Burgett against Defendants Armen Nahabedian and Vahagn Nahabedian. The motion relates to employment agreements and disputes arising from a change in control of Shadow Wolf Energy, LLC (SWE). The Judge grants the motion in part, requiring further responses from both defendants within 30 days.
