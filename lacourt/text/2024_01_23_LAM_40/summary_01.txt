And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has tentatively ruled on two motions filed by the Defendant, Your Home Sold Guaranteed Realty Inc. (YHSG), to compel further responses to form interrogatories (Set One) from the Plaintiffs, Suk Young Yun and Myung Ja Yun, and to request sanctions. The motions were denied due to lack of meet and confer and inadequate separate statements.

The Court found that YHSG failed to show a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of the issues presented by the motion, and that the Separate Statements filed with the motion did not provide sufficient information about the alleged deficiencies in the responses. The Court also denied the motions because YHSG failed to file an Amended Separate Statement with the Reply, which would have provided additional information about the Requests for Admission at issue.

The Court granted the Plaintiffs' requests for sanctions in the amount of $1000 each, payable within 30 days, from YHSG and their counsel. The sanctions were awarded because YHSG's counsel failed to meet and confer with the Plaintiffs, and because the motions failed to demonstrate deficiencies on their face.
