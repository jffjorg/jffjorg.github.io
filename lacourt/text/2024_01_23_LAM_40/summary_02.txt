Here is a brief summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to file a Fourth Amended Complaint (4AC) against the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS). The 4AC is intended to add new causes of action and defendants, alleging negligence, breach of contract, and interference with contractual relations. The judge has allowed the amendment despite potential issues with timeliness and futility, citing the policy of liberally granting leave to amend. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to file the 4AC within five court days of service of the order.
