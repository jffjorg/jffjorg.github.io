 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant Your Home Sold Guaranteed Realty, Inc.’s Motion to
  Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One) of Myung Ja Yun,
  and Request for Sanctions (CRS# 9385); and
Defendant Your Home Sold Guaranteed Realty, Inc.’s Motion to

Background
Pleadings
Plaintiffs Suk Young Yun and Mying
Ja Yun (the Yun Plaintiffs) sue Defendants Caroline Kyung Lee (Lee), Lee’s
supervisor realtor, Freeman Wang, and Lee’s realty brokerage group, Your Home
Sold Guaranteed Realty, Inc. (YHSG), allegedly owned by Lee and Wang, and Does
1-50 pursuant to an October 11, 2022 Second Amended Complaint (SAC).
The SAC alleges claims of (1)
Breach of Fiduciary Duty, (2) Fraud, (3) Negligence, (4) Conversion, (5)
Trespass of Real Property, (6) Conversion, (7) Tort of Another, (8) Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress, (9) Negligent Infliction of Emotional
Distress, and (10) Unfair Competition.
The claims arise from allegations
that—while acting as realtor for the Yun Plaintiffs in the sale of 7416 Jason
Avenue, West Hills, California (the Subject Property)—Lee, Wang, and YHSG
Realty engaged in various actions amounting to breaches of fiduciary duty, conversion,
trespass to real property, and other harms to the Yun Plaintiffs. Defendants’
conduct included allowing people to enter the Subject Property without a proper
register of persons who gained admission, which permitted a theft of personal
property one day before closing on escrow, including more than $100,000 in
losses comprised of irreplaceable family jewels, cash, and personal possessions,
the theft of which spurred an ongoing Los Angeles Police Department
investigation.
In turn, Defendants Lee, Wang, and YHSG
sue the Yun Plaintiffs’ daughter and counsel, Stephanie Yun, Esq., pursuant to
an October 11, 2022 First Amended Cross-Complaint alleging claims of (1) Equitable
Indemnity, (2) Equitable Contribution, and (3) Declaratory Relief.
The claims arise from allegations
that Stephanie Yun was also responsible for the harm suffered by the Yun
Plaintiffs given Stephanie Yun’s conduct as durable power of attorney for the
Yun Plaintiffs during the sale of the Subject Property.
Stephanie Yun sues Defendant Lee
and Does 1-50 pursuant to a July 26, 2022 Cross-Complaint alleging claims of
(1) Invasion of Privacy, (2) Public Disclosure of Private Facts, and Negligence.
The claims arise from allegations
that, during Lee’s representation of the Yun Plaintiffs in the sale of the
Subject Property, Lee wrongfully disclosed confidential information belonging
to Stephanie Yun to the Yun Plaintiffs, i.e., Stephanie Yun’s parents.
Motions Before the Court
On March 31, 2023, Defendant YHSG
served Form Interrogatories (Set One) (FROGs, Set One) on the Yun Plaintiffs.
On May 26, 2023, the Yun Plaintiffs
allegedly provided objections to the discovery.
On June 30, 2023, after receiving
two meet and confer letters, the Yun Plaintiffs served unverified responses to
FROGs, Set One.
On August 3, 2023, the Yun
Plaintiffs served amended responses to FROGs, Set One.
Between September 7, 2023 and
October 9, 2023, the parties met and conferred regarding supplemental
responses.
On October 16, 2023, Plaintiff
provided supplemental responses to FROGS, Set One.
On October 20, 2023, Defendant YHSG
filed motions to compel further responses to its FROGS, Set One, No. 17.1 from each
of the Yun Plaintiffs. Both motions request monetary sanctions from the Yun
Plaintiffs and their counsel.
On January 9, 2024, the Yun
Plaintiffs individually opposed the motion to compel further directed at them.
On January 16, 2024, Defendant YHSG
filed replies to the Yun Plaintiffs’ oppositions.
Defendant YHSG’s motions are now
before the Court.
 
Preliminary
Note
A trial court may construe a motion
bearing one label as a different type of motion. (Austin v. Los Angeles
Unified School Dist. (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 918, 930.) “‘The nature of a
motion is determined by the nature of the relief sought, not by the label
attached to it. The law is not a mere game of words. … The principle that a
trial court may consider a motion regardless of the label placed on it by a
party is consistent with the court’s inherent authority to manage and control
its docket.’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.) 
The Court notes that these motions
are brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300 rather than
section 2030.290 because the Yun Plaintiffs’ individual October 16, 2023
responses to FROGs, Set One, No. 17.1 provided substantive responses to this
interrogatory, for which reason, the proper section pursuant to which these
motions should be brought is section 2030.300. (Cf. Motions, p. 2 [Notice,
showing motions brought pursuant to “CCP § 2030.290 (a) and (b)”].)
 
Motion
to Compel Further Interrogatory Responses, Plaintiff Myung Ja Yun
Meet and Confer
A motion to compel further
interrogatory responses must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subd. (b)(1).) A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion shall state
facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of
each issue presented by the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)
Order Compelling Further
Responses: DENIED.
YHSG’s motion is directed at
compelling further responses to FROGs, Set One, No. 17.1 from Plaintiff M. Yun.
(See 9385 Mot., p. 2.) The responses at issue were served on October 16, 2023.
(9385 Mot., Hernandez Decl., Ex. K, POS; cf. 9385 Mot., Separate Statement
[seeking further responses as to responses dated October 16, 2023].) This
motion was filed four days later, on October 20, 2023. (9385 Mot., p. 1.) Nowhere
do YHSG’s counsel’s declarations explain whether there were meet and confer
efforts between service of the challenged discovery responses and the filing of
this motion four days later. (9385 Mot., Hernandez Decl., ¶¶ 1-15 [last
background fact provided by YHSG’s counsel is Myung Ja Yan’s service of
supplemental responses on October 16, 2023 but fails to mention subsequent meet
and confer before filing of motion]; 9385 Reply, pp. 5-6 & Hernandez Decl.,
¶¶ 1-19 [same].) The fact that a broad meet and confer letter was served before
the challenged responses were provided does not show that the parties actually
met and conferred regarding these challenged responses.
YHSG’s motion is thus DENIED for
failure to sufficiently meet and confer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd.
(b)(1); See 9385 Opp’n, p. 2 [making this argument].)
Moreover, YHSG failed to file a
proper Separate Statement complying with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345
subdivision (5) such that the Court cannot tell from looking at the document what
the Requests for Admission at issue in the Form Interrogatory relate to; an
Amended Separate Statement that contained such information was only filed untimely
with the Reply. Nor can the Court tell from either Separate Statement, the Memorandum
in support of the Motion, or the Reply brief what the alleged deficiencies in
the responses actually are. These would constitute additional reasons to deny
the motion.
Sanctions: DENIED.
The court must
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).)
The
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)

Because YHSG’s motion was denied,
sanctions are also DENIED.
 
Motion to Compel Further Interrogatory Responses, Suk Young
Yun
Meet
and Confer
A
motion to compel further interrogatory responses must be accompanied by a meet
and confer declaration under Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b)(1).) A meet and confer declaration in support
of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2016.040.)
Order
Compelling Further Responses: DENIED.

YHSG’s motion is directed at
compelling further responses to FROGs, Set One, No. 17.1 from Plaintiff M. Yun.
(See 1866 Mot., p. 2.) The responses at issue were served on October 16, 2023.
(1866 Mot., Hernandez Decl., Ex. L, POS; cf. 1866 Mot., Separate Statement
[seeking further responses as to responses dated October 16, 2023].) This
motion was filed four days later, on October 20, 2023. (1866 Mot., p. 1.) Nowhere
do YHSG’s counsel’s declarations explain whether there were meet and confer
efforts between service of the challenged discovery responses and the filing of
this motion four days later. (1866 Mot., Hernandez Decl., ¶¶ 1-15 [last
background fact provided by YHSG’s counsel is Suk Young Yan’s service of supplemental
responses on October 16, 2023 but fails to mention subsequent meet and confer
before filing of motion]; 1866 Reply, pp. 5-6 & Hernandez Decl., ¶¶ 1-20
[same].)
YHSG’s motion is thus DENIED for
failure to sufficiently meet and confer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd.
(b)(1); see 1866 Opp’n, p. 10 [making this argument].)
Moreover, YHSG failed to file a
proper Separate Statement complying with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345
subdivision (5) such that the Court cannot tell from looking at the document what
the Requests for Admission at issue in the Form Interrogatory relate to; an
Amended Separate Statement that contained such information was only filed untimely
with the Reply. Nor can the Court tell from either Separate Statement, the Memorandum
in support of the Motion, or the Reply brief what the alleged deficiencies in
the responses actually are. These would constitute additional reasons to deny
the motion.
Sanctions: DENIED.
The court must impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd.
(d).)
The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
Because YHSG’s motion was denied,
sanctions are also DENIED.
Plaintiffs’
requests for sanctions
Plaintiffs’ requests for sanctions
on the two motions are hereby granted in the reduced amount of $1000 for each motion
because 1) the declarations revealed a lack of meeting and conferring; 2) there
was an inadequate separate statement; and 3) the motions failed to demonstrate deficiencies
on their face. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010 subd. (h) and (i); id. at § 2023.030
subd. (a).
