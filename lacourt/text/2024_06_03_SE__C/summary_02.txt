And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the defendants' joint ex parte application to advance the hearing date for their motion for temporary stay of proceedings. However, the court has denied without prejudice the defendants' joint ex parte application to continue the hearing date for their motion for judgment on the pleadings, pending the resolution of the issue of the constitutionality of Section 905(m) of the Government Code. The hearing date for the motion for stay of proceedings has been advanced to August 15, 2024, and the hearing date for the motion for judgment on the pleadings has been advanced to August 20, 2024. The court has also ordered that opposition and reply papers be filed and served in accordance with the new hearing dates.
