The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Shaozhang Li's application for default judgment against Defendants An Ni, Xiaotian Yin, Zhao Wei Ding, and Yomie Rice X Yogurt Inc. (Yomie Yogurt) without prejudice. The Judge finds that the Complaint fails to state a cause of action for breach of contract and fraud against the Defendants. Specifically, the Complaint does not allege sufficient facts to establish the existence of a contract between Li and Yomie Yogurt, nor does it allege specific misrepresentations made by the Defendants that induced Li's reliance. The Judge notes that Li may be given leave to amend the Complaint to correct these deficiencies.
