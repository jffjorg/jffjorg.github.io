  Case Number:  23LBCV01307    Hearing Date:   August 6, 2024    Dept:  S25 Procedural HistoryOn July 12, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a complaint against Defendants City of Long Beach, Paramount Unified School District and Does 1 to 50, alleging premises liability and general negligence causes of action. Plaintiffs allege that on May 27, 2022, Plaintiff Jayson Smith, a minor, was improperly restrained and injured by Defendant’s employees while at school. (Compl., pp. 4-5.) On October 20, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. On March 14, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a request for dismissal as to the City of Long Beach. (March 14, 2024 Request for Dismissal.) On April 25, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s motion to continue trial, continuing the trial date to October 28, 2024 and the final status conference to October 25, 2024, with all trial related deadlines to reflect the new trial date. (April 25, 2024 Minute Order.) On July 1, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion to bifurcate the liability and damages phases of trial. On July 26, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an opposition. On July 30, 2024, Defendant filed a reply.Legal StandardUpon a properly noticed motion of a party made no later than the close of pretrial conference, or in other cases, no later than 30 days before the trial date, a court may bifurcate a trial into separate issues when the convenience of witnesses, the ends of justice, or the economy and efficiency of handling the litigation would be promoted thereby. (Code Civ. Proc., § 598.) “The court, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and economy, may order a separate trial of any cause of action, or of any separate issue of any number of causes of action, preserving the right of trial by jury as required by the Constitution or a statute of this state or of the United States.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd. (b).)Where a separate trial is ordered on the issue of liability, the procedure is commonly referred to as “bifurcation.” The objective of bifurcation is to avoid wasting time and money on the trial of damages issues if the liability issue is resolved against plaintiff. (Horton v. Jones (1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 952, 954-955.) Granting or denying of a motion for separate trials lies within the trial court's sound discretion. (Grappo v. Coventry Financial Corp. (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 496, 504.) “The court, however, over the objection of a party, cannot order the separate trial of an issue of liability when because of the nature of the case it is necessary to prove the plaintiff's damages in order to establish that liability.” (Cohn v. Bugas, 42 Cal. App. 3d 381, 385-386.)Tentative RulingDefendants' motion to bifurcate liability and damages is denied. Due to the nature of the case, it is necessary to prove that a specific type of damage occurred to establish liability. (Cohn v. Bugas (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 381, 385-386.) Any concerns of biases and prejudices on the part of Defendant can be addressed with through the voir dire process.
