And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to bifurcate the liability and damages phases of the trial. The judge believes that due to the nature of the case, it is necessary to prove that a specific type of damage occurred in order to establish liability. The judge is concerned that bifurcating the trial could lead to the plaintiff's damages being proven in order to establish liability, which would be a reversal of the usual order of proof. The judge notes that any concerns about biases and prejudices on the part of the defendant can be addressed through the voir dire process.
