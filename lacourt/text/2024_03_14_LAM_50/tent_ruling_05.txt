[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff
Midway Rent a Car, Inc., a California Corporation dba Midway Fleet Leasing dba
Midway Leasing dba Midway HFCA LLC (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default
judgment against Defendant Jennifer Timario aka Jennifer Enriquez in the total
amount of $83,700.22, comprising $77,935.05 in damages, $2,818.47 in interest,
$498.00 in costs, and $2,448.70 in attorney’s fees. (See Request for
Court Judgment filed September 20, 2023.) 
On
December 11, 2023, the Court issued a minute order on Plaintiff’s request for
default judgment, providing, inter alia, as follows: 
 
“Plaintiff submits
the Declaration of Kevin Hy in support of the request. Mr. Hy asserts that
“Plaintiff is entitled to Attorney Fees in the amount of $2,448.70 per Exhibit
5 & 6 @ par. 11 ‘…the prevailing party is entitled to all costs and [sic]
incurred in the action, including attorney fees...’” (Hy Decl., ¶ 9, emphasis
omitted.) The Court notes that it is unable to locate this language in Exhibits
5 or 6 attached to the Hy Declaration. Plaintiff does not appear to cite any
additional contractual provision purportedly authorizing attorney’s fees here.
Pursuant to the request of plaintiff, the Status Conference Re: Review of
Default Judgment scheduled for 12/11/2023 is continued to 03/14/2024…” 
            On March 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
supplemental declaration of Kevin Hy. Mr. Hy asserts in his supplemental declaration
that “Plaintiff is entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs pursuant to
Exhibits 1 & 2, at paragraph 25 C. (3)…” (Suppl. Hy Decl., ¶ 3, emphasis
omitted.) Paragraph 25(C)(3) of the subject California Motor Vehicle Lease
Agreements provide, inter alia, “Early Termination Liability is
calculated as follows:…(3) Any reasonable court costs; attorneys’ fees and
other collection costs that we pay to recover, store, and sell the Vehicle,
unless prohibited by law…” (Suppl. Hy Decl., ¶¶ 3, Exs. 1-2.) However,
Plaintiff does not appear to provide any evidence demonstrating that it
incurred attorneys’ to recover, store, and sell the subject vehicle(s). 
Based on the foregoing,
the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for default judgment without prejudice.
The Court will discuss with Plaintiff a schedule for resubmission of the
default judgment package.
