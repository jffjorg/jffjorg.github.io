And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for sanctions filed by the plaintiff, Weiner, against the defendants, Sam, Michael, Tanya, and Julia Hakim, and their companies, Onyx Tower Operating Agreement and Management Company (OTM). The plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached the AMA (employment agreement) and the Onyx Tower Operating Agreement, failed to pay compensation, and diverted income. The judge notes that the plaintiff only discussed legal authority concerning the determination of reasonable fees, but failed to provide evidence to support their claims. The judge is considering the plaintiff's request for sanctions, including a full accounting to determine the amounts owed under the AMA. The judge will consider the defendants' opposition to the motion and make a final ruling at a later date.
