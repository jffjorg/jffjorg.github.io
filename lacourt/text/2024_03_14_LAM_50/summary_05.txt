And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on Plaintiff's request for default judgment against Defendant Jennifer Timario aka Jennifer Enriquez. The request is for a total amount of $83,700.22, comprising damages, interest, costs, and attorney's fees. The judge notes that the Plaintiff's initial declaration did not provide adequate evidence to support the request, and the Plaintiff failed to cite any contractual provision authorizing attorney's fees. The judge also notes that the Plaintiff did not provide evidence demonstrating that it incurred attorneys' fees to recover, store, and sell the subject vehicle(s). As a result, the judge denies the request for default judgment without prejudice, and will discuss with the Plaintiff a schedule for resubmission of the default judgment package.
