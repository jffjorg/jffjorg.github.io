Significant Statements:
  - "The court may impose a terminating sanction by one of the following orders: (1) an order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process... (2) an order staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is obeyed... (3) an order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that party... (4) an order rendering a judgment by default against that party." (California Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030)
  - "The courts have long recognized that the terminating sanction is a drastic penalty and should be used sparingly. A trial court must be cautious when imposing a terminating sanction because the sanction eliminates a party's fundamental right to a trial, thus implicating due process rights." (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604)
