And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The County of Los Angeles has demurred to Kelsey Chapman's complaint, alleging that the complaint is untimely. The court agrees that the complaint is untimely, as it was filed more than six months after the alleged incident. The court also finds that the plaintiff's attempt to present a late claim is invalid, as it was made after the initial claim was deemed insufficient. The court sustains the County's demurrer with 20 days leave to amend. The court also grants the County's request for judicial notice. The plaintiff's claims are rejected, and the case is dismissed.
