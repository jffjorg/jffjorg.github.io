RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Defendant demurrers to Plaintiff’s
complaint. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
            This case arises out of Plaintiff
Kelsey Chapman’s (“Plaintiff”) claim that Defendants failed to maintain the
roads at the intersection of Lake Avenue and Morada Place in Altadena,
California. Plaintiff alleges that on May 4, 2022, she was driving her moped
when the dangerous condition at the intersection caused her to lose control of
her moped, fall, and slide into a parked vehicle. Plaintiff filed this
complaint on April 18, 2023, alleging one cause of action for dangerous
condition of public property. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            The
County’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint is SUSTAINED with 20 days leave to
amend.
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL
NOTICE
 
            The County’s request for judicial notice is GRANTED pursuant to Evidence
Code section 452, subdivision (c).
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
A general
demurrer may be taken to a complaint where “[t]he pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.” (Code of Civ. Proc. § 430.10(e).) A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747.) In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or by proper judicial
notice.  (Code Civ. Proc. section
430.30(a).)  A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or
other extrinsic matters.  (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153
Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is
whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.  (Hahn v.
Mirda, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Additionally, a
special demurrer to a complaint may be brought on the ground the pleading is
uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible. Code Civ. Proc section 430.10(f); Beresford Neighborhood Assn. v. City of
San Mateo (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1180, 1191.) A demurrer based
on uncertainty is disfavored and will be strictly construed even when the
pleading is uncertain in some respects. (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) A demurrers based on uncertainty are “granted only if
the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably
respond.” (Lickiss v. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (2012) 208
Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            The
County of Los Angeles (the “County”) demurrers to Plaintiff’s complaint on the
grounds that Plaintiff’s complaint is untimely. 
 
            Plaintiff
alleges that she suffered injuries on May 4, 2022. (Complaint ¶ 10.) Plaintiff alleges that she filed a claim with
the County on September 1, 2022, that was deemed insufficient. (Id. ¶ 13.) Plaintiff alleges that she filed an amended claim
with the County on October 25, 2022, which was also deemed insufficient. (Id.
¶ 15.) Plaintiff alleges that she filed an application to present a late
clam with the County on April 18, 2023. (Id. ¶ 17.)
 
            The County argues that Plaintiff’s complaint is untimely
pursuant to Government Code section 945.6.[1] Section 945.6, subdivision (a)(1), provides
that any suit brought against a public entity for which a claim is required
must be commenced not later than six months after the date of notice, if notice
is given in accordance with Section 913. In opposition, Plaintiff argues that
she has filed a petition in the related case, case number 23AHCP00445, and that
her amended claim sets a new deadline for her to file the present lawsuit.
 
“Under the Government Claims Act,
personal injury claims against public entities generally must be presented to
the entity within six months of accrual of the injury. [Citation.] Absent an
applicable exception, ‘failure to timely present a claim for money or damages
to a public entity bars a plaintiff from filing a lawsuit against that entity.’
” (Coats v. New Haven Unified School District (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 415,
420.)
 
            Section
911.2 requires claims relating to “injury to person” to be presented not later
than six months after the accrual of the cause of action. Plaintiff’s two
initial claims, filed on September 1, 2022, and October 25, 2022 (Complaint ¶¶ 13 and 15) were within 6 months of the
alleged incident on May 4, 2022. Plaintiff’s September 1, 2022, claim was
deemed insufficient, and the County provided a letter on September 23, 2022,
that contained language in accordance with section 913. (RJN Exhibits 1 and 2.)
Thus, pursuant to section 945.6, Plaintiff’s complaint, filed on April 18,
2023, over six months after the September 23, 2022, is facially untimely. 
 
            Plaintiff argues that her claims are timely based on her
application for leave to present a late claim pursuant to section 911.4 and the
amendments allowed for by section 910.6. Plaintiff’s arguments are unavailing.
Plaintiff filed her application to file a late claim on April 18, 2023.
(Complaint ¶ 17.) However, the language of the applicable statutes calls
into question the validity of Plaintiff’s arguments that the deadlines were
extended.
 
            Section 911.4, subdivision (a), provides: “When a claim that
is required by Section 911.2 to be presented not
later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action is not presented
within that time, a written application may be made to the public entity for
leave to present that claim.” Here, Plaintiff did file an application
for leave to present a claim but subsequently filed an application to present a
late claim despite the fact that her initial claim was already deemed
insufficient. 
 
Further, section 910.6, subdivision
(a), provides: “A claim may be amended at any time before the expiration of the
period designated in Section 911.2 or before final
action thereon is taken by the board, whichever is later, if the claim as
amended relates to the same transaction or occurrence which gave rise to the
original claim. The amendment shall be considered a part of the original claim
for all purposes.” Here, Plaintiff attempted to amend the claim within the
applicable timeframe, but the amended claim was also deemed insufficient.
(Complaint ¶ 15.) Plaintiff’s April 18,
2023, application to present a late claim is not an amendment to the September
1, 2022, claim because it was made after the six-month period detailed in
section 911.2.
 
Plaintiff’s argument that the April
18, 2023, application to present a late claim reset the deadline to file the
complaint is rejected. Plaintiff failed to timely amend her claim and failed to
bring the present case within six months after the initial rejection. It would
not make sense to allow Plaintiff to circumvent the statutory framework, after
failing to adhere to the statutory deadlines, by filing an “application to
present a late claim” when she already made a timely claim presentation.
 
CONCLUSION
 
            The
County’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint is SUSTAINED with 20 days leave to
amend.
 
            Moving
party to give notice.
