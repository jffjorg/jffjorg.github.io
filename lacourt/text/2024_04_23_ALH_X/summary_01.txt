Summary:
The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant had argued that the plaintiff's claims were barred by the Government Claims Act and that the statutory exception to the claim presentation requirement was an unlawful gift. The judge rejected these arguments, holding that the statutory exception was a valid exercise of the legislature's power to revive causes of action previously barred by government claims presentation requirements. The judge found that the plaintiff's claims were not barred by the claim presentation requirement and that the statutory exception did not violate the California Constitution.
