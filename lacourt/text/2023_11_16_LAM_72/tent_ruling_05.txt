Defendant Cynthia Edwards (“Edwards”) demurrers to the First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”) filed by Plaintiff Green Development LLC (“Plaintiff”).
Edwards additionally moves to strike the complaint.
 
Edwards’ demurrer is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND and
this action is STAYED pending the outcome of Los Angeles Superior Probate Court
Case No. B296924.
 
Edwards’ motion to strike is DENIED AS MOOT.
 
Background
 
This is a quiet title action. The property at issue is real
property located at 1032 West 136th Street in Compton, California (the
“Property”). The Property was held by Alonzo Toles (“Toles”) until his death.
 
On August 4, 2015, Eugene Davis (“Davis”), a nephew of the
decedent Alonzo Toles, filed in the Los Angeles Superior Probate Court a
petition to determine succession to the Property, Case No. B296924. (Request
for Judicial Notice (“RJN”), Exh. A.) 
 
On February 5, 2016, the probate court determined that Toles
had died intestate, and transferred the Property to nine cousins, including
Davis.  (Complaint, Exh. B at p. 4.)  On October 3, 2016, Plaintiff entered into a
contract of sale to purchase the property from Davis.  (Id.)
 
On January 19, 2017, Edwards filed a petition to set aside
the order determining succession (Complaint, Exh. B at p. 5.)  Edwards, who claims to be the beneficiary of
the decedent’s will, argued that Davis had fraudulently failed to join her when
he knew of the possible existence of the will. (Id.) Edwards filed and
recorded a lis pendens on the Property on January 24, 2017. (Complaint, ¶ 12.)
 
The Probate Court held a one-day bench trial and granted the
set-aside order requested by Edwards. 
(Complaint, Exh. B at p. 5.) Plaintiff appealed, and the Court of
Appeal affirmed the set-aside order, but also held that the Probate Court had
not decided the question of the validity of the will alleged by Edwards or the
ultimate question of the property’s ownership. (Complaint, Exh. B at pp.
12-13.)
 
Plaintiff filed this action on January 13, 2022. The
operative complaint is the FAC, which is unverified and alleges claims for
quiet title and declaratory and injunctive relief. The FAC names as defendants
Eugene Davis, both individually and as a representative of the estate of Alonzo
Toles; Cynthia Edwards; and all persons claiming any interest in the property
at issue.
 
Edwards filed these motions on September 11, 2023. Plaintiff
filed oppositions, and Edwards filed replies.
 
Judicial Notice
 
Edwards requests that the Court take judicial notice of two
items:
 
1.. Petition to
Determine Successor to Real Property filed in Case No. B296924 entitled Estate
of Alonzo Toles, Deceased, filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court on August 4,
2015.
2. Opinion from the Court of Appeal of the State of
California, Second Appellate
District, Division 3, B296924, filed on August 24, 2021.
 
Judicial notice may be taken of the records of any court in
the State of California. (Evid. Code § 452, subd. (d). The Court therefore
GRANTS Edwards’ request for judicial notice.
 
Legal Standard
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading
alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants,
Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) The court assumes the truth
of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.) The only issue a demurrer is
concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of
action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be
allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335,
348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Ibid.;
Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f
there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause
of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245). 
 
“In order for the bar of the statute of limitations to be
raised by demurrer, the defect must clearly and affirmatively appear on the
face of the complaint; it is not enough that the complaint shows merely that
the action may be barred.” (McMahon v. Republic Van & Storage Co.
(1963) 59 Cal.2d 871, 874.)
           
 
Discussion
 
Exclusive Concurrent Jurisdiction
 
“Under the rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction, when
two [California] superior courts have concurrent jurisdiction over the subject
matter and all parties involved in litigation, the first to assume jurisdiction
has exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over the subject matter and all
parties involved until such time as all necessarily related matters have been
resolved.” (People ex rel. Garamendi v. American Autoplan, Inc. (1993)
20 Cal.App.4th 760, 769-770 [internal quotations and citations omitted].) “[T]he
pendency of another earlier action growing out of the same transaction and
between the same parties is a ground for abatement of the second action.” (Id.
at 770 [internal quotations and citations omitted].) “The rule is based upon
the public policies of avoiding conflicts that might arise between courts if
they were free to make contradictory decisions or awards relating to the same
controversy and preventing vexatious litigation and multiplicity of suits.” (Shaw
v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (2022) 78 Cal.App.5th 245, 255
[internal citations omitted].) 
 
The rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction and the
statutory plea in abatement should be raised by demurrer where the issue
appears on the face of the complaint and by answer where factual issues must be
resolved. (Garamendi, supra, 20 Cal.App.4th at p. 771.) “Where
abatement is required [under the plea in abatement or the rule of exclusive
concurrent jurisdiction], the second action should be stayed, not dismissed.” (Ibid.)
 
Furthermore, "[a] party against whom a complaint has
been filed may object to the pleading on the grounds that “[t] is another
action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 430.10, subd. (c).)
 
          The
concurrent probate case involves the same subject matter as this case – the
clarification of title to the Property. Davis, Edwards,  and Plaintiff are all parties to the probate
case. Indeed, Plaintiff was the appellant in the unsuccessful appeal of the
Probate Court’s decision.  If the alleged
will is entered into probate, the probate court will likely reach a
determination about who holds title to the property. Thus, a ruling in this
court on Plaintiff’s quiet title action would risk conflicting with the
findings of the probate court. 
 
It is therefore improper for the court to assert
jurisdiction over this matter. Because the lack of jurisdiction resulting from
the probate court’s assertion of jurisdiction cannot be remedied, amendment
would be futile at this time, and leave to amend is denied.
 
          Because
a stay on this action is appropriate, the Court does not reach Plaintiff’s
remaining arguments on the demurrer or the motion to strike.
