And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by DCX Technology, Inc. and Mary Finch (the "Defendants") to seal certain documents. The Judge has granted the motion, finding that the Defendants have made the necessary showing to seal the documents under California Rules of Court 2.550 and 2.551. The Judge has determined that there is an overriding interest in sealing the documents, including the protection of privacy rights of third parties and proprietary business information of the Defendants. The Judge has also found that a substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed, and that the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored and no less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.
