And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 22STCV16247, denying the motion for a judgment of possession filed by the defendants, Jose P. Laguna and Jose P. Laguna Trust. The defendants had moved to enforce a settlement agreement and requested attorney's fees. The judge found that the notice of motion did not state the grounds for issuance of the order and that the issues presented were unclear. The judge also noted that the settlement agreement was not fully attached to the motion and that there was still a pending trial date in the matter. The judge granted the defendants permission to serve a properly noticed motion if they wish to seek relief from the court.
