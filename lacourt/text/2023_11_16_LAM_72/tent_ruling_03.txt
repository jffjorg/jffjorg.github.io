SHAKEDRA BEARDEN, et al.,

                                  Defendants.
 


 Case No: 
  21STCV21404
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  November 16, 2023
 Calendar Number:  4



 
 
 
Plaintiffs Shakedra Bearden and Herman Gaither
(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) move for attorney’s fees incurred on appeal.
Plaintiffs request $14,542 in attorney’s fees. 
 
Plaintiffs’ motion for attorney’s fees is GRANTED.  Defendants Nashawn Durden and Valiant Group
of California LLC (“Valiant”)(collectively, “Defendants”) shall pay $14,542
within 60 days directly to Plaintiffs’ counsel.
 
Background
 
Plaintiffs were tenants at a building owned by Defendants. Plaintiffs
alleged that during the tenancy, the property rented by Plaintiffs had a number
of serious sanitation issues as a result of Defendants’ negligence.
Additionally, Durden wrongfully evicted Plaintiffs by welding their door shut,
boarding up the windows, and posting fake official notices indicating that the
property had been closed by the sheriff’s order.
 
Plaintiffs filed this action on June 7, 2021, alleging a
number of causes of action arising out of these events.
 
Defendants failed to answer the complaint. The Court entered
a default judgment  for Plaintiffs in the
amount of $350,000. 
 
Defendants moved to set the judgment aside. The Court denied
Defendants’ motion on March 10, 2022.
 
Defendants appealed the denial of the motion. The Court of
Appeal affirmed the trial court’s denial of the motion to set aside default on
August 29, 2023. The Court of Appeal determined that Plaintiffs are entitled to
their costs on appeal.
 
The lease agreement between Plaintiffs and Defendants
provides that the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s
fees and costs in any action to enforce any part of the lease.
 
Plaintiffs filed this motion on September 25, 2023. No
opposition was filed.
          
 
Legal Standard
 
The lodestar method for calculating attorney fees applies to
any statutory attorney fees award, unless the statute authorizing the award
provides for another method of calculation. (Glaviano v. Sacramento City
Unified School Dist. (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 744, 750-751.) “Under the
lodestar method, the trial court must first determine the lodestar figure—the
reasonable hours spent multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate—based on a
careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of
each attorney involved in the presentation of the case.” (Id. at p.
751.) 
 
The trial court has broad authority to determine the amount
of a reasonable fee. (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095.)  
 
The moving party bears the burden of proof as to
“reasonableness” of any fee claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(5).)
The party seeking fees has the burden of documenting the appropriate hours
expended and hourly rates. (City of Colton v. Singletary (2012) 206
Cal.App.4th 751, 784.) This burden requires competent evidence as to the nature
and value of the services rendered. (Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182
Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) A plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima
facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were necessarily
incurred. (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) 
 
“In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many
hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point
to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to
the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative,
or unrelated do not suffice.” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 488, quoting Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. California
Ins. Guarantee Ass’n (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) When items are
properly objected to, the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as
costs. (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623-624.)
 
“[C]ontractually authorized attorney fees … may either be
requested of the appellate court while the appeal is pending, or of the trial
court upon issuance of the remittitur. The trial court has jurisdiction to
award them, regardless of the lack of specific instructions in the opinion or
the remittitur.” (Harbour Landing-Dolfann, Ltd. v. Anderson (1996) 48
Cal.App.4th 260, 264–265.)
           
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiffs are entitled to attorney’s fees on the contract
because they are the sole prevailing party.
 
Hourly Rate
 
Plaintiffs request an hourly rate of $525.00 for attorney
Matthew L. Brinton. (Brinton Decl. ¶ 3.) Brinton has over 10 years of
experience in civil litigation and has practiced real estate litigation for
roughly 7 years. (Brinton Decl. ¶ 2.) The Court finds Brinton’s hourly rate to
be reasonable.
 
Billable Hours
 
Plaintiffs request a total of 27.70 hours. (Brinton Decl.
¶.) Plaintiffs provide a time sheet documenting the hours spent on the appeal.
(Brinton Decl. ¶ 7, Exh. D.) The Court finds the time expended to be
reasonable.
 
For these reasons, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion in
full.
