```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has considered the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants, and has made the following findings:

* The demurrer is sustained with leave to amend as to the first cause of action (breach of contract) as asserted against Related, as the plaintiff has failed to properly allege that Related is an alter ego of Core.
* The demurrer is overruled as to the second cause of action (recovery against mechanic's lien), as the plaintiff has properly alleged that the mechanic's lien was filed against the correct parties.
* The motion to strike is denied, as the allegations at issue are proper and relevant to the case.
* The motion to demur to the fourth cause of action (quantum meruit) is sustained with leave to amend, as the plaintiff has failed to properly allege the facts necessary to support a quantum meruit claim.
* The motion to strike the demand for attorney's fees is denied, as the contract at issue provides for attorney's fees and the demand is proper.
* The motion to strike the alter ego allegations is denied as moot, as the demurrer has already addressed these allegations.

The court finds that the plaintiff's complaint states a cause of action for breach of contract and quantum meruit, but that the plaintiff must amend its complaint to properly allege the facts necessary to support these claims. The court also finds that the defendants have failed to properly allege that the plaintiff's mechanic's lien was invalid, and that the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages and attorney's fees for the breach of contract and quantum meruit.
