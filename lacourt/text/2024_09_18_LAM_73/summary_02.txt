Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories Nos. 14, 40-45, and 61. Defendant General Motors LLC must provide code-compliant responses to these interrogatories within 30 days.

The plaintiff, Hasmik Ghazaryan, leased a 2021 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 from General Motors in 2020 and has been experiencing various defects and malfunctions with the vehicle. The plaintiff alleges that General Motors failed to conform the vehicle to warranties and has filed a lawsuit against the company.

The plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories is based on the argument that General Motors' responses to the interrogatories are incomplete, evasive, and non-responsive. The plaintiff seeks to identify the individuals who performed warranty repairs on the vehicle, the individuals responsible for investigating whether the vehicle qualified for repurchase or replacement under the Song-Beverly Act, and the total number of days the vehicle was out of service for warranty repairs.

The judge has found that General Motors' responses to the special interrogatories are not code-compliant and has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses. The judge has also ordered General Motors to provide supplemental responses to the special interrogatories Nos. 40-45 and 61.

The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and the California Business and Professions Code. The judge has also cited a previous case, Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Superior Court, in support of the ruling.
