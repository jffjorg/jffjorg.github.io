I. BACKGROUND
 
On January 26, 2024, Plaintiff Claire Donahue brought this action
against Defendants 427 S Mariposa Partners, LP; LA Urban Living LLC; Jeclim
LLC; Jeremy Miller; Philip G. Miller and Annie Boxell. 
 
The Complaint alleges the following. Plaintiff was an occupant of
real property located at 427 S Mariposa, Unit 511 Los Angeles, CA (the
“Property”) as a lessee/tenant under a written lease with Defendants. Plaintiff
alleges that on April 6, 2020, Plaintiff reported an active leak and water
damage in the bedroom ceiling to management, who acknowledged the issue but
failed to conduct repairs despite multiple follow-ups. On January 25, 2022,
Plaintiff discovered additional mold growth in the bedroom after heavy rains.
Plaintiff informed the building manager and requested repairs. During Plaintiff’s tenancy, Defendants failed to maintain the
Property in a safe and habitable condition. Plaintiff was eventually forced to vacate the Property due to
health issues while living in the Property. Defendants constructively evicted
Plaintiff from the Property—having refused to make the required repairs to the
Property and ensure the Property be made safe and habitable, and after
Plaintiff told Defendants that Plaintiff suspected that the fungal growth at
the Property was making Plaintiff sick. The Complaint alleges the following
causes of action:
1.      Breach of the
implied warranty of habitability;
2.      Nuisance;
3.      Breach of
contract;
4.      Negligence;
5.      Negligent
misrepresentation;
6.      Constructive
eviction;
7.      Premises
liability;
8.      Fraud; and 
9.      Intentional
infliction of emotional distress.
 
On July 10, 2024, Defendants Jeclim LLC,
LA Urban Living LLC, Jeremy Miller, Philip G. Miller and Annie Boxell
each filed Motions
to Deem Request for Admissions, Set One, Admitted and Request for Sanctions. No
opposition was filed. 
 
On August 15,
2024, the Court held the hearing on the Motions to Deem Request for Admissions,
Set One, Admitted against Defendants Jeclim LLC and LA Urban Living LLC. The Court continued the
hearing to allow any opposition to the motion to be filed no later than August
28, 2024. No opposition has been filed. Defendants filed notices of
non-opposition. 
 
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard 
 
 When a party fails to
serve a timely response to a request for admission, the party propounding the
request for admission may move for an order to deem the genuineness of any
documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests admitted.
(Code Civ. Proc., §¿2033.280, subd. (b).) A party who fails to provide a timely
response waives any objection, including one based on privilege or work
product. (Id., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The court shall make this order,
unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been
directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to
the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section
2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction… on the
party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (Id., § 2033.280,
subd. (c).)
 
B.      Discussion
 
On March 22, 2024, Defendants Jeclim
LLC, LA Urban Living LLC, Jeremy Miller, Philip G. Miller and Annie
Boxell’s served Plaintiff electronically with
Requests for Admissions, Set One. (Ghattas Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A). Plaintiff’s
responses were due on April 24, 2024, 30 days following service, plus an
additional two court days for electronic service. (Cal. Code Civ. Pro. §§
2030.260, subd. (a) and 1013, subd. (a).) However, Plaintiff failed to provide
responses by April 24, 2024. (Ghattas Decl., ¶ 3.) 
 
The parties met and conferred regarding Plaintiff’s failure to
respond. On April 25, 2024, Defendants sent an email to Plaintiff’s counsel to
confer about Plaintiff’s failure to respond to Defendants’ written discovery
requests. Defendants
allowed Plaintiff until May 3, 2024 to serve verified answers without
objections to Defendants’ discovery requests. (Ghattas Decl., ¶ 4.) On April 25, 2024, in response to Defendants’ meet and confer
correspondence, Plaintiff’s counsel claimed that Defendants failed to properly
serve their written discovery requests in violation of Code of Civil Procedure
section 1010.6(b)(3). (Ghattas Decl., ¶ 5.) On April 25, 2024, Defendants
offered to grant Plaintiff an extension of time to respond as another sign of
good faith. (Ghattas Decl., ¶ 6.) On April 29, 2024, after receiving no
response, Defendants followed up with Plaintiff’s counsel to determine how long
Plaintiff will need to provide Defendants with her responses. (Ghattas Decl., ¶
7.) On April 30, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel stated that he would accept service
electronically from April 30, 2024, making Plaintiff’s responses due on or
before June 4, 2024. (Ghattas Decl., ¶ 8.) On June 7, 2024, after still not
receiving Plaintiff’s responses, Defendants sent Plaintiff’s counsel a second
email to meet and confer, extending Plaintiff until June 14, 2024 to provide
verified answers, without objection. (Ghattas Decl., ¶ 9.) As of the date of
the filing of the instant motion, Defendants have not received any
communication from Plaintiff’s counsel regarding Plaintiff’s Response to
Defendant’s Request for Admissions, nor have Defendants received Plaintiff’s
Response to Defendant’s Request for Admissions. (Ghattas Decl., ¶ 10.)
 
On August 15,
2024, the Court held the hearing on the Motions to Deem Request for Admissions,
Set One, Admitted against Defendants Jeclim LLC and LA Urban Living LLC. The Court continued the
hearing to allow any opposition to the motions to be filed no later than August
28, 2024. However, the Court notes that Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
 
Thus, it appears Defendants offered Plaintiff multiple extensions
to provide Defendants with her responses. However, Plaintiff has failed to
serve responses. Therefore, the motion is
granted. The truth of the matters specified in Defendants Jeclim LLC,
LA Urban Living LLC, Jeremy
Miller, Philip G. Miller and Annie Boxell’s Requests
for Admissions, Set One, are hereby deemed admitted.
 
Defendants request monetary sanctions for counsel’s work on each
of its Motion to Deem Request
for Admissions, Set One, Admitted against
Plaintiff. Defendants request $1,360.00 for each motion, representing 5 hours
of attorney work at an hourly rate of $260, plus $60 for the filing fee. (Id.
¶¶ 12-13.) 
 
The Court finds sanctions are warranted because Plaintiff has
failed to respond. However, since the motions are unopposed, the Court will not award
Defendants’ anticipated fees for preparing a Reply. Further, each of the
motions will be heard on the same day, thus, the Court will reduce the amount
Defendants request to attend the hearing. The Court awards each Defendant attorney’s
fees for two hours of attorney work and for the filing fee. Thus, monetary
sanctions are awarded in the reduced amount of $580 as to each Defendant. 
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS each
of Defendants Jeclim LLC, LA Urban Living LLC, Jeremy Miller, Philip G. Miller and Annie Boxell’s requests for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff in the
reduced amount of $580.00 as
to each Defendant. 
 
III. DISPOSITION

 
Defendants
Jeclim LLC, LA Urban Living LLC, Jeremy Miller, Philip G. Miller and Annie Boxell’s Motions to Deem Request for Admissions, Set One,
Admitted are GRANTED. The truth
of the matters specified in the Requests for Admissions, Set One, are hereby
deemed admitted.
 
The
Court further GRANTS each of Defendants Jeclim LLC, LA Urban Living LLC, Jeremy
Miller, Philip G. Miller and Annie Boxell’s requests
for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff in the reduced amount of $580.00. Said monetary sanctions
are to be paid to Defendants’ counsel as to each Defendant within 30 days of
the date of this order.
