And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a denial of the Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings. The motion seeks to dismiss the Plaintiffs' claims for direct injury, alleging that the claims for direct injury alleged in the first, second, and fourth through seventh causes of action must be dismissed. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs have standing to bring direct claims against the Defendants, as they have alleged specific and distinct injuries not suffered by the Partnership. The Court also finds that the Plaintiffs' claims for declaratory relief, accounting, and violation of inspection rights are all related to the Partnership Agreement and are not derivative claims. The Court denies the motion for judgment on the pleadings, as the Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged standing to bring direct claims against the Defendants.
