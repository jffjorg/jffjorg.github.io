Ruling:                               PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION TO COMPEL MARTINEZ PUMPING SERVICE INC’S COMPLIANCE WITH PLAINTIFF’S
SUBPOENA FOR THE PRODUCTION OF BUSINESS RECORDS AND FOR SANCTIONS IS DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE
 
 
 
On April 5,
2022, Plaintiff filed this premises liability lawsuit. On December 1, 2023,
Plaintiff served a deposition subpoena for the production of business records
on Martinez Pumping Service Inc., requiring the production of documents by
December 29, 2023. Martinez Pumping Service Inc. failed to produce any
documents by the specified date. Plaintiff now moves the court to compel
deponent’s compliance with the subpoena. The motion and notice of motion were
delivered to the third-party deponent, Martinez Pumping Service Inc., via email
and express mail.
 
California Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1346 provides that a “written notice and all moving papers
supporting a motion to compel an answer to a deposition question or to compel
production of a document or tangible thing from a nonparty deponent must be
personally served on the nonparty deponent unless the nonparty deponent agrees
to accept service by mail or electronic service at an address or electronic
service address specified on the deposition record.”  Plaintiff failed to provide proof of service
demonstrating that written notice and all supporting documents for a motion to
compel were personally served on Martinez Pumping Service Inc. Additionally,
there is no evidence to suggest that Martinez Pumping Service Inc. consented to
accept service via mail or electronic means at an address or electronic service
address noted on the deposition record. Consequently, the current motion to
compel and for sanctions is DENIED without prejudice.
