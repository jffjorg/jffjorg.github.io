Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to enforce a settlement agreement with the Defendant City of Los Angeles. The Plaintiff claims that a settlement was reached on July 19, 2023, for $750,000, but the settlement agreement is signed only by the Plaintiff and his counsel, with the Defendant's signature missing. The judge notes that CCP § 664.6 requires the signatures of all parties to the agreement, and since the Defendant's signature is missing, the settlement agreement is not enforceable under this statute. The judge also notes that the settlement agreement is conditioned upon approval by the city council, which the Defendant is pursuing. The judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion, citing the lack of compliance with the statutory requirements for enforcing a settlement agreement under CCP § 664.6.
