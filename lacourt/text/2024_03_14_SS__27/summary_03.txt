Statutes:
  - California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 36
  - California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 36.5
  - California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 36, subdivision (f)
Role:
  - Plaintiff (JAMES PHILLIP THOMAS, et al.): seeking trial preference
  - Defendant (CITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al.): opposing trial preference
Significant Statements:
  - "The issue under subdivision (a) is not whether an elderly litigant might die before trial or become so disabled that she might as well be absent when trial is called. Provided there is evidence that the party involved is over 70, all subdivision (a) requires is a showing that the party's 'health . . . is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing [his/her] interest in the litigation.'"
  - "Subdivision (a) requires the granting of calendar preference to 'prevent' prejudice to a stricken litigant's interests. The idea that [plaintiff] should be made to wait to file a preference motion until she is clearly in her final days—when attendance at a trial is hardly what she should be doing—makes no sense at all."
  - "Where a party meets the requisite standard for calendar preference under subdivision (a), preference must be granted. No weighing of interests is involved."
  - "Failure to complete discovery or other pretrial matters does not affect the absolute substantive right to trial preference for those litigants who qualify for preference."
