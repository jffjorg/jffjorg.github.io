Ruling:                     PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO ENFORCE SETTLEMENT IS
DENIED 
 
Background 
 
On August 19, 2019, Plaintiff filed the
present trip and fall lawsuit against the City of Los Angeles. Plaintiff claims
that a settlement was reached during mediation on July 19, 2023, for the amount
of $750,000. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant is purposely delaying the
settlement of this case by claiming that the settlement needs to be approved by
the city council. Plaintiff now moves the Court to enforce the July 19, 2023
settlement agreement pursuant to CCP § 664.6. Plaintiff attached a copy of the purported
settlement agreement to the motion.  However,
that agreement is signed only by Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel.  Defendant's signature is missing.
 
Motion to Enforce Settlement 
 
CCP § 664.6 states: “If parties to pending
litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence
of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part
thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of
the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction
over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the
terms of the settlement.”¿ 
¿ 
Strict compliance with the statutory
requirements is necessary before a court can enforce a settlement agreement
under this statute.¿ (Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 30, 37.)¿ To
enforce a written settlement agreement under CCP section 664.6, the following
three elements must be met: (1) the parties must have come to a meeting of the
minds on all material points; (2) there must be a writing that contains the
material terms of the agreement; and (3) the writing must be signed by the
parties.¿ (Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998)
60 Cal.App.4th 793, 797-98.)¿ 
¿ 
CCP § 664.6 “require[s] the signatures of the
parties seeking to enforce the agreement under [Code of Civil Procedure]
section 664.6 and against whom the agreement is sought to be enforced.”¿ (J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v. Fair (2014) 232
Cal.App.4th 974, 985.)¿ CCP § 664.6’s “requirement of a ‘writing signed by the parties’ must be read to apply to all parties bringing
the section 664.6 motion and against whom the motion is directed.”¿ (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th
299, 306; see Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Const., Inc.
(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 35-37 [“A written settlement agreement is not
enforceable under section 664.6 unless it is signed by all of the parties to
the agreement, not merely the parties against whom the agreement is sought to
be enforced.”].)¿ “A procedure in which a settlement is evidenced by one writing
signed by both sides minimizes the possibility of … dispute[s] and legitimizes the summary nature
of the section 664.6 procedure.”¿ (Robertson
v. Chen (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1290, 1293.)¿¿¿ 
 
Analysis and Conclusion 
The Court examined the purported settlement
agreement in question. It is signed only by Plaintiff and his counsel.
Defendant’s signature is missing. “A written settlement agreement is not
enforceable under section 664.6 unless it is signed by all of the parties to
the agreement, not merely the parties against whom the agreement is sought to
be enforced.” (Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction,
Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37).  Further, the purported agreement specifically
states in it that it is conditioned upon approval by the city council.  That is what defendant has indicated it is
waiting for and is, in fact, pursuing.  Plaintiff’s
motion, at best, borders on frivolous and is hereby DENIED.
