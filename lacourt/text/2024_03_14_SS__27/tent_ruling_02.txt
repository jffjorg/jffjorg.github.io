Background¿ 
¿ 
On October
10, 2019, Plaintiff filed the present motor accident lawsuit. On January 24,
2023.Defendants served Special Interrogatories, Set Two, and Requests for
Production, Set Three, on Plaintiff. The deadline for Plaintiff’s verified
responses was February 27, 2023. Defendants did not receive any discovery
responses or a request for an extension by the deadline. Plaintiff eventually
served late responses on April 19, 2023, consisting of only objections.
(Exhibit B.) Subsequently, on May 4, 2023, defense counsel sent a meet and
confer email to Plaintiff’s counsel, seeking verified substantive responses and
the withdrawal of objections. On May 15, 2023, Plaintiff provided supplemental
responses that contained substantive responses, but were both unverified and
contained objections. (Exhibit D.) Defendants now move the Court to compel
Plaintiff to serve verified discovery responses to its Special Interrogatories,
Set Two, and Requests for Production, Set Three without objections.
 
Legal Standard
 
A plaintiff may make a demand for
production of documents and propound interrogatories without leave of court at
any time 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the
party to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for
production of documents is not limited by number, but the request must comply
with the formatting requirements in Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.030. A party
may propound 35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the
subject matter of the pending action and any additional number of official form
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (a)(1) - (a)(2).)¿¿ 
¿ 
The party whom the request is
propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service of a
demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and
confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a)
- (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).)¿¿ 
¿ 
If a party fails to timely respond
to a request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request
is directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)¿¿The party propounding the discovery requests may move for an order
compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) Unlike a motion to compel further discovery responses,
a motion to compel initial discovery responses does not have any meet and
confer requirements.¿
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may
impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes
failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿¿A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable
monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare
Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
Analysis
 
It is
undisputed that Plaintiff did not serve timely initial discovery responses. Due
to Plaintiff's failure to provide timely responses, she has forfeited all
objections, including those pertaining to privilege. It is a well-established
principle that unverified responses are considered "tantamount to no
responses at all." Appleton v. Superior Court, (1988) 206
Cal.App.3d 632, 636. Plaintiff’s latest discovery responses are unverified and
contain objections. Consequently, Defendant's motion to compel is GRANTED, and
Plaintiff is ORDERED to submit verified discovery responses without objections
within 30 days from today.
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff requests sanctions in
the amount of $880.00 for each motion. Although a meet and confer is not
required to file a motion for initial responses, the parties did engage in
communication and met and conferred. Despite these efforts, Defendant chose to
file the present motion without initially addressing the deficiencies in
Plaintiff’s discovery responses with Plaintiff’s counsel before filing the
present motions. Thus, Defendant’s request for sanctions is DENIED.
