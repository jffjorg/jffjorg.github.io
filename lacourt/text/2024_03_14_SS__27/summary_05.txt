And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend to file a first amended complaint to include a claim for punitive damages. The plaintiff tripped over a pothole in the parking lot of a Winchell's Donut shop and is seeking damages, including punitive damages. The judge has found that the plaintiff's allegations, if proven, show that the defendant's employees were negligent or grossly negligent, but do not demonstrate that the employees were aware of the probable dangerous consequences and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences. The judge has also found that the plaintiff's proposed first amended complaint did not include allegations claiming that Yum Yum's managing agents ratified or authorized malicious actions, and it is unlikely that the plaintiff can reasonably plead such allegations.
