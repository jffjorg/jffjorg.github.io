And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel Martinez Pumping Service Inc.'s compliance with the subpoena for the production of business records and for sanctions without prejudice. The plaintiff filed this premises liability lawsuit on April 5, 2022, and served a deposition subpoena on December 1, 2023, requiring the production of documents by December 29, 2023. However, Martinez Pumping Service Inc. failed to produce any documents by the specified date. The plaintiff moved the court to compel compliance with the subpoena and impose sanctions. The court found that the plaintiff failed to provide proof of service demonstrating that written notice and all supporting documents for the motion to compel were personally served on Martinez Pumping Service Inc. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that Martinez Pumping Service Inc. consented to accept service via mail or electronic means at an address or electronic service address noted on the deposition record.
