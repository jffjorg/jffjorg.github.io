And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Ally Bank's application for a writ of possession against Evie Cruz for a 2022 Chevrolet Trailblazer motor vehicle. The judge finds that Ally Bank is not the proper plaintiff and that Ally Financial, the legal owner of the vehicle, has not been given notice of the proceedings. The judge also finds that the evidence presented by Ally Bank does not demonstrate a security interest in the vehicle and that the bank's claim is not probably valid. As a result, the application for a writ of possession is denied without prejudice.
