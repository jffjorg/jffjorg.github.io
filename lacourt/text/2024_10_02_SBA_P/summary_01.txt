And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to quash the subpoenas issued by the defendant. The defendant, Phillip's Draperies and Curtains, Inc., has requested medical records from the plaintiff, Lindsey Menco, to support its defense in the case. The plaintiff argues that the subpoenas are overly broad and invasive of her privacy, while the defendant argues that the records are necessary to determine which symptoms can be attributed to the accident and which were caused by the plaintiff's pre-existing conditions.

The court finds that the defendant has sufficiently explained how the requested records are directly relevant to the lawsuit and that the need for the information outweighs the plaintiff's right to privacy. The court also finds that the plaintiff has not shown that the subpoenas are oppressive or that the defendant has acted in bad faith.

The court has also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant and the defendant's request for sanctions against the plaintiff. The case is set for a hearing on October 2, 2024.
