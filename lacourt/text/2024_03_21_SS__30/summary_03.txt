And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer is sustained without leave to amend. The motion to strike is denied as moot. The defendant, Platt Security, Inc., demurred to the plaintiff's fourth and fifth causes of action, alleging that they fail to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action against the defendant.

The judge found that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state facts sufficient to show that the defendant had a duty to protect the plaintiff from the assault. The plaintiff's complaint also fails to state facts sufficient to show that the defendant knew or should have known that their employees were unfit or incompetent.

The judge denied the plaintiff's request to amend the complaint, finding that there is no reasonable possibility of successfully amending the pleadings. The defendant's previous motion for judgment on the pleadings has previously been granted as to the negligence cause of action, and the plaintiff has failed to correct the deficiencies.

The court will not grant leave to amend, and the demurrer is sustained as to the negligence cause of action. The motion to strike is denied as moot.
