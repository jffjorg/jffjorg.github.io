 Case Number:  22STCV19488    Hearing Date:   March 21, 2024    Dept:  30 GILBERT GUERRERO vs FRANKLIN VLADIMIR LOPEZ ALAS, et al.TENTATIVEPlaintiff's Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set Two, is DENIED. Defendant's request for sanctions is DENIED.Defendant to give notice.DISCUSSIONThe Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts Effective October 10, 2022 provides guidance regarding a party's Motion to Compel Further. It states:  "Ideally, the parties should participate in an IDC before a Motion to Compel is filed because the IDC may avoid the necessity of such a motion or, at least, reduce its scope.  Because of that possibility, parties are encouraged to stipulate to extend the deadline for filing a Motion to Compel Further Discovery Responses by 60 days in order to allow time to participate in an IDC and to informally resolve the pending discovery issues....  If parties do not stipulate to extend the deadlines to file a Motion to Compel Further Discovery Responses, the moving party may file the motion to avoid it being deemed untimely." Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts Effective October 10, 2022, Section E, p. 8, ls. 3-13.A motion to compel further responses must be filed and served within 45 days of the service of the verified responses, any supplemental responses, or on such later date as the parties have agreed to in writing.  (CCP 2030.300, 2031.310, 2033.290).  A party that fails to bring a timely motion to compel further responses waives any right to compel further responses. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 288).  The deadline is jurisdictional.  Thus, the Court lacks authority to grant an untimely motion to compel further responses.  (Id.; Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 CAl.App.,4th 1403, 1410.)  Further, the Eighth Amended Standing Order makes clear that the parties should protect their rights vis a vis the discovery statutes.Here, the Defendant agreed to extend the deadline to January 31, 2024. In an email dated December 11, 2023, Defense Counsel wrote "I'm amenable to extending the motion deadline to three weeks post-IDC until January 31, 2023(sic)." (Dec. Saha, Exh. 2) In a second email dated December 13, 2023, Counsel reiterated. "As stated in my email dated 12/11/23, Defendant will grant plaintiff a three week extension until January 31, 2023(sic), to file a motion to compel further responses should the Informal Discovery Conference be unsuccessful for the parties." (Id. at Ex. 3.)  No other agreement to extend the deadline was given. When the Informal Discovery Conference was continued, no further stipulation was sought. A stipulation must be construed according to the ordinary rules for interpretation of contracts, with the paramount consideration being the parties' objective intention at the time of contracting. (See Miles v. Speidel (1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 879, 883-884.) Generally, a contract, to be susceptible of specific enforcement, must be certain and unequivocal in its terms; and a vague and uncertain contract is not capable of specific enforcement. Thus, in this case, the Court can only surmise that the agreement was to extend the deadline to file the motion until January 31, 2024, as explicitly stated. Otherwise, no agreement to extend the deadline was ever made because no meeting of the minds existed as one party relied upon the contingency of "three weeks post-IDC" and one relied upon "until January 31, 2023 (sic)."  Since the IDC was delayed, but occurred prior to January 31, 2024, the Court finds that the stipulated extension expired on January 31, 2024.Having determined that Plaintiff was required to bring a motion to compel further on or prior to January 31, 2024, the Court finds that Plaintiff's filing it on February 16, 2024 is untimely. The Court is without jurisdiction to reach the merits of the motion. Accordingly, the Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set Two, is denied.Regarding Defense Request for SanctionsFirst, the Court does not give orders at Informal Discovery Conferences, nor does it give orders about matters not ripe before it. Thus, the Defendant's statement regarding any orders the Court made except to continue to meet and confer is misplaced.Sanctions were requested, for the first time, in the opposition, and no notice of request for sanctions was served on Plaintiff. The request for sanctions is denied.
