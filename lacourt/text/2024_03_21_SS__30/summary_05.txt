And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to consolidate this case with two related cases. The defendant argued that all three cases involve the same collision and the same or similar parties, and that consolidation would prevent inconsistent verdicts and recoveries. However, the judge ruled that the cases cannot be consolidated because they have not been deemed related or assigned to the same department. Additionally, the defendant failed to file the required notice of motion to consolidate in the related cases. The judge cited several laws and court rules in support of the ruling, including Code of Civil Procedure Section 1048 and California Rules of Court Rule 3.350. The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change after the hearing on March 21, 2024.
