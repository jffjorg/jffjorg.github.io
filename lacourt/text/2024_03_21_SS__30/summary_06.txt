And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Keck Medical Center of USC, has filed motions to compel responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, request for production, and to have matters in requests for admissions deemed admitted. The court has granted these motions, ordering the plaintiff, Carin Dickmeyer, to provide verified responses to the discovery requests within 30 days. The court has also found that the defendant is entitled to an order establishing the truth of the matters in the request for admissions served on the plaintiff.

The defendant had previously served the discovery requests on the plaintiff on July 24, 2023, and the responses were due on or before August 25, 2023. However, the plaintiff failed to provide responses, despite an extension granted by the defendant's counsel until October 15, 2023.

The court has denied the defendant's request for sanctions, as the notice of motion did not identify who the sanctions were sought against. The court has also continued the plaintiff's counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiff, as the mandatory judicial council forms have not been completed and proof of service has not been provided.

Overall, the court has granted the defendant's motions to compel and has ordered the plaintiff to provide verified responses to the discovery requests.
