And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Walgreen Co. and Shirley Tse, have moved for summary judgment on the plaintiff's cause of action for negligence/premises liability. The plaintiff, Renee Ileene Trejo, alleges that she fell from her wheelchair due to a dangerous condition on the parking lot of the defendants' store. The defendants argue that the condition was trivial and that they did not have actual or constructive notice of the condition. The plaintiff argues that the condition was not trivial due to the slope of the parking lot.

The court finds that there are triable issues of material fact as to whether the condition was a trivial defect because the slope of the area contributed to the dangerousness of the height differential due to the potential of the wheelchair to pitch forward when it contacts a height differential in an area that is sloped. The court also finds that there are triable issues of material fact as to whether the defendants had constructive notice of the dangerous condition as it was present for two years prior to the incident.

The court denies the defendants' motion for summary judgment and finds that there are triable issues of material fact as to causation. The court concludes that the defendants have not presented sufficient evidence to show that they did not cause the plaintiff's injury.
