And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, Gilbert Guerrero, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Gilbert Guerrero vs Franklin Vladimir Lopez Alas, et al. The Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories, set two, is denied. The Defendant's request for sanctions is also denied. The Judge's ruling is based on the Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts, which provides guidance on motions to compel further discovery responses. The parties agreed to extend the deadline for filing a motion to compel further responses to January 31, 2024, but the Plaintiff's motion was filed on February 16, 2024, which is untimely. The Judge finds that the stipulated extension expired on January 31, 2024, and therefore the Plaintiff's motion is denied. The Judge also denies the Defendant's request for sanctions, as it was not served on the Plaintiff and was not ripe for consideration at the Informal Discovery Conference.
