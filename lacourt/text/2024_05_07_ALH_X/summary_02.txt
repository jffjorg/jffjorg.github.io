Summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the court's decision regarding the demurrer filed by the defendants. The court overrules the demurrer as to the fourth cause of action for quiet title, finding that the plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to support their claim. However, the court sustains the demurrer as to the ninth cause of action for negligence, finding that the plaintiffs have failed to plead sufficient facts to demonstrate proximate cause. The court grants the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint to cure the deficiencies.
