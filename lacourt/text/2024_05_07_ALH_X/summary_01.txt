Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the petitioner's petition for relief from the requirements of Government Code section 945.4. The petitioner, Kelsey Chapman, was injured in a motor scooter accident on May 4, 2022, and filed claims for damages with the County of Los Angeles. The County deemed the claims insufficient and denied them. The petitioner refiled the claims, but the County maintained that the claims were still insufficient. The judge finds that the petitioner has demonstrated diligence in the timeliness of her first and original claim filed on August 31, 2022. The judge also finds that the petitioner stated the location of the incident with sufficient particularity such that the County would have had the opportunity to investigate the location had it chosen to. The judge concludes that the petitioner has met the requirements of Government Code section 946.6, subdivision (c)(1), and grants the petition.
