Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiffs' motions to compel further responses to requests for production from the defendants, Alma Nunez and Joseph H. Low IV. The plaintiffs had requested the production of an audio recording made by Nunez of the plaintiff in his office, which the defendants had objected to based on attorney-client and work-product privilege. The judge finds that the requests are supported by good cause and that the defendants' objections are without merit. The judge also finds that the plaintiffs' meet and confer efforts were adequate and that the defendants did not provide a legitimate argument for why the recording should be privileged. As a result, the judge orders the defendants to produce the recording. The plaintiff had also requested attorney fees as monetary sanctions, but the judge denies this request because the plaintiff is self-represented and not entitled to fees.
