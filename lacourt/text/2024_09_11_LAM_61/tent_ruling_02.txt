 Case Number:  23STCV20210    Hearing Date:   September 11, 2024    Dept:  61 ARAM BAGRAMYAN vs FMB DEVELOPMENT, LLC, et al.TENTATIVEPlaintiff Aram Bagramyan’s Motion for Terminating Sanctions against Defendants FMB Development, LLC and Ilan Kenig is DENIED.Clerk to give notice.DISCUSSIONThe court may impose terminating sanctions, include an order striking pleadings, and order dismissing an action, or an order rendering judgment by default against a party, for conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) This conduct includes “[f]ailing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery,” and “[d]isobeying a court order to provide discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified where there is a willful discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and evidence showing that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery rules. (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) Dismissal is a drastic measure, and terminating sanctions should only be ordered when there has been previous noncompliance with a rule or order and it appears a less severe sanction would not be effective. (Link v. Cater (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1326.) “[A] penalty as severe as dismissal or default is not authorized where noncompliance with discovery is caused by an inability to comply rather than willfulness or bad faith.” (Brown v. Sup. Ct. (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.)Plaintiff Aram Bagramyan (Plaintiff) seeks terminating sanctions against Defendant FMB Development, LLC and Ilan Kenig (Defendants), based on Defendants’ failure to comply with this court’s order of June 12, 2024, compelling responses to Plaintiff’s special interrogatories and requests for production. (Motion at pp. 5–7; Madnick Decl. ¶ 8.)Based on Plaintiff’s showing and materials in the court’s file, it is not clear that sanctions are appropriate, as it is not apparent that Defendants have notice of this court’s June 12, 2024 order, or of the present motion. Defendants’ counsel was relieved by order of this court on January 3, 2024, with Defendants’ last known address given by their former counsel was 8383 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 230, in Los Angeles. (See 1/3/2024 Order.) Plaintiff’s motions to compel were accordingly served on this address. However, this court on June 18, 2024, received a notice that the order mailed to Defendants’ address on the date of hearing was returned with the notice, “Forward Time Exp Rtn to Send.” (6/18/2024 Returned Mail Notice.) On August 8, 2024, this court received a second returned mail notice, indicating that mailing at the same address was “Not deliverable as addressed, unable to forward.” (8/8/2024 Returned Mail Notice.)The address listed for Defendant FMB Development on California’s Business Search portal is 5900 Wilshire Boulevard, 2125, in Los Angeles. This court on August 27, 2024, attempted to mail a notice of OSC to Defendants at the 8383 Wilshire address. But on September 4, 2024, this court received another returned mail notice, this time stating: “Forward Time Exp Rtn to Send,” listing the address as 5900 Wilshire Blvd Fl 21 in Los Angeles, matching the address registered to Defendant FMB with the California Secretary of State (See 9/4/2024 Returned Mail Notice.) The present motion was served on Defendants at their 8383 Wilshire Boulevard address.The present motion is based solely on the fact that Defendants have not provided responses in compliance with the June 12, 2024 order. The present motion was served upon Defendants at the same 8383 Wilshire address that has yielded repeated “returned mail” notices for the court. Plaintiff does not describe any efforts to contact Defendants following the entry of the order. (Ghoorchian Decl. ¶¶ 5–6; Madnick Decl. ¶¶ 7–8.) Given the court’s records of returned mail after service on the same address, it is likely that Defendants do not have notice of the order. Sanctions would therefore be inappropriate.The motion is therefore DENIED.
