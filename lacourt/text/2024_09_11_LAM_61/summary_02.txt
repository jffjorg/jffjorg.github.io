And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions against the defendants, FMB Development, LLC and Ilan Kenig. The motion was based on the defendants' failure to comply with a court order to respond to the plaintiff's special interrogatories and requests for production. However, the judge found that it is not clear that the defendants had notice of the court's order or the motion, as there were repeated returned mail notices after service on the defendants' address. The judge concluded that sanctions would be inappropriate in this case, as the defendants may not have had notice of the order due to the inability to comply rather than willfulness or bad faith.
