And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for terminating sanctions and monetary sanctions against the defendant, Vianey Elizabeth Sanderson, as the defendant has paid the sanctions. The judge has also denied the motion to hold the defendant in contempt, as there is no evidence showing that the defendant had the ability to comply with the court orders and whether she willfully disobeyed the court order. The judge notes that contempt is not proper in this case, as the issue is a failure to pay monetary sanctions, which does not tend to impede, embarrass, or obstruct the court's discharge of its duties. Instead, the proper recourse to recover sanctions would be for the plaintiff to enforce the sanctions order as a money judgment pursuant to the Enforcement of Judgments Law.
