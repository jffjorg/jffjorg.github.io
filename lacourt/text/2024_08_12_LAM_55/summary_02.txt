significant_statements:
  - The party prevailing in the Court of Appeal in a civil case is entitled to costs on appeal.
  - A party may recover only the following costs, if reasonable: filing fees; the amount paid for any portion of the record; the cost to produce additional evidence on appeal; the costs to notarize, serve, mail, and file the record, briefs, and other papers; the cost to print and reproduce any brief, including any petition for rehearing or review, answer, or reply; the cost to procure a surety bond, including the premium, the cost to obtain a letter of credit as collateral, and the fees and net interest expenses incurred to borrow funds to provide security for the bond or to obtain a letter of credit, unless the trial court determines the bond was unnecessary; and the fees and net interest expenses incurred to borrow funds to deposit with the superior court in lieu of a bond or undertaking, unless the trial court determines the deposit was unnecessary.
  - If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.
  - If the items appear to be proper expenses, they are themselves prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services were necessarily incurred.
  - If the items appear proper, it is not enough for the losing party to attack submitted costs by arguing that he thinks the costs were not necessary or reasonable. Rather, the losing party has the burden to present evidence and prove that the claimed costs are not recoverable.
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The motion to strike the verified memorandum of costs filed by Defendant In-N-Out Burgers is denied. The court finds that the costs listed in the memorandum are prima facie evidence that they were reasonably incurred, and that the burden of showing that they were not is on the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs failed to meet this burden, as they did not submit any evidence to support their claims that the costs were unreasonable or unnecessary. The court also finds that the costs were reasonably necessary, including the cost of preparing a reporter's transcript, which was necessary for the appeal. Therefore, the motion to strike costs is denied.
