And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel further responses to Plaintiffs' Request for Production of Documents, Set One. The Plaintiffs leased a 2022 Honda Pilot vehicle and alleged defects and/or nonconformities, but the Defendant failed to fix them. The Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel further responses, and the Defendant filed an opposition. The Judge finds that certain requests for production are overly broad and vague and therefore denies them. Specifically, the Judge denies requests for documents related to internal analysis or investigation of engine defects, fixes for engine defects, technical service bulletins, and warranty extensions. The Judge also finds that certain documents may be protected by attorney-client privilege. The Judge does not award monetary sanctions as the Plaintiffs do not seek monetary awards. The hearing is scheduled for December 10, 2024.
