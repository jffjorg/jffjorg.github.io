  Case Number:  22LBCV00165    Hearing Date:   December 10, 2024    Dept:  S25 Defendants QNDM Properties, LLC, QNDM Distribution, LLC and Kelly Marie Dooley’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff Ali J, LLC to Provide Further Responses to Defendants’ Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for Monetary SanctionProcedural HistoryOn October 25, 2024, Defendants filed the instant motion to compel the Ali J, LLC toprovide further responses to Defendants’ Requests for Production of Documents, Set One. On October 28, 2024, Defendants filed an amended separate statement. On November 25, 2024, Plaintiff Ali J LLC and Plaintiffs Schutz Trust filed a combined opposition. On December 3, 2024, Defendants filed a reply.Legal Standard“On receipt of a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the following apply: (1) A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete. (2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. (3) An objection in the response is without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., 2031.310, subd. (a).) The court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).)Meet and ConferThe meet and confer requirements have been satisfied.DiscussionDefendants move to compel Plaintiff Ali J further responses to Defendants’ Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, Nos. 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 22, 23, 24,25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32. Defendants argue that Plaintiff Ali J has failed to produce all responsive documents it claimed it would; thus, failing to comply with Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.280, subd. (b). Defendants also contend that Plaintiff Ali J fails to comply with Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.280, subd. (a)., which requires Plaintiff Ali J to identify the specific request number to which each of the produced documents respond. (See Omnibus Trauben Decl., ¶ 16.)Plaintiff Ali J opposes the motion asserting that its responses indicating document production is appropriate under Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.220. Plaintiff Ali J also argues that while it acknowledges the requirements of Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.280, subd. (a), plaintiff Ali J followed Defendants’ primary instruction that the documents be produced “in the same form as they were kept immediately before the receipt of the demand.” (Kinley Decl., ¶ 4, Exs. C-D.)The court’s electronic file does not contain the Kinley Declaration. It is unclear whether this declaration was filed. However, Plaintiffs’ November 15, 2024, proof of service indicates that a declaration was served on opposing counsel along with the opposition papers and the two separate statements. The court has no reason to suspect that the statements attributed to Mr. Kinley in Plaintiffs’ Opposition are inconsistent with the statements asserted in the unfiled Kinley Declaration. The Court encourages Plaintiffs’ counsel to immediately file the Kinley Declaration.Tentative RulingThe instant motion is GRANTED, in part, as to Request for Production, Set One, Nos. 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32.The Court finds that Plaintiff Ali J complied with the statutory requirement of Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.220, by stating it would comply with Defendants’ request and produce all responsive documents, which Plaintiff Ali J did at the time of the written responses and on November 25, 2024. However, as to Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.280, subd. (a), the Court finds that Plaintiff Ali J, in its responses, must identify the documents by the specific request to which they respond. (See Pollock v. Superior Court (2023) 93 Cal.App.5th 1348, 1358.) Plaintiff Ali J must identify the documents with the specific request number to which the documents respond within 15 days of the date of this order. Defendants’ request for monetary sanctions is denied. The court finds that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).)Defendants QNDM Properties, LLC, QNDM Distribution, LLC and Kelly Marie Dooley’s Motion to Compel Plaintiffs Michael Schutz and Nicole Schutz, Trustees of the Michael & Nicole Schutz Family Trust Dated July 21, 2004 to Provide Further Responses to Defendants’ Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for Monetary SanctionsProcedural HistoryOn October 25, 2024, Defendants filed the instant motion to compel the Schutz Trust toprovide further responses to Defendants’ Requests for Production of Documents, Set One. On October 28, 2024, Defendants filed an amended separate statement. On November 25, 2024, Plaintiff Schutz Trust filed a combined opposition with Plaintiff Ali J LLC.

(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).)Meet and ConferThe meet and confer requirements have been satisfied.DiscussionDefendants move to compel Plaintiff Schutz Trust’s further responses to Defendants’ Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, and 44. Defendants argue that Schutz Trust has failed to produce all responsive documents it claimed it would; thus, failing to comply with Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.280, subd. (b). Defendants also contend that Plaintiff Schutz Trust fails to comply with Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.280, subd. (a)., which requires Plaintiff Schutz Trust to identify the specific request number to which each of the produced documents respond.

(a), Plaintiff Schutz Trust followed Defendants’ primary instruction that the documents be produced “in the same form as they were kept immediately before the receipt of the demand.” (Kinley Decl., ¶ 4, Exs. C-D.)It appears Plaintiff Schutz Trust has failed to file a separate statement; instead, the two separate statements were filed by Plaintiff Ali J. The Court advises the parties that while it will not grant the motion solely on this basis and it expects the parties to comply fully with all statutory requirements and court rules. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a) & (c) [“any motion involving the content of a discovery request or the responses to such a request must be accompanied by a separate statement.”]) Further, Defendants do not raise this oversight in their opposition. Accordingly, it is likely that Plaintiff Schutz Trust served their separate statement on Defendants. The Court encourages Plaintiffs’ counsel to immediately file Plaintiff Schutz Trust’s Separate Statement.Further, the court’s electronic file does not contain the Kinley Declaration. It is unclear whether this declaration was filed. However, Plaintiffs’ November 15, 2024, proof of service indicates that a declaration was served on opposing counsel along with the opposition papers and the two separate statements. The court has no reason to suspect that the statements attributed to Mr. Kinley in Plaintiffs’ Opposition are inconsistent with the statements asserted in the unfiled Kinley Declaration.

Proc., § 2031.220, by stating it would comply with Defendants’ request and produce all responsive documents, which Plaintiff Schutz Trust did at the time of the written responses and on November 25, 2024. However, as to Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.280, subd. (a), theCourt finds that Plaintiff Schutz Trust, like Plaintiff Ali J, in its responses, must identify the documents by the specific request to which they respond. (See Pollock v. Superior Court (2023) 93 Cal.App.5th 1348, 1358.)Plaintiff Schutz Trust must identify the documents with the specific request number within 15 days of the date of this order.Defendants’ request for monetary sanctions is denied. The court finds that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).)
