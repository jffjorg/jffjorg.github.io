And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the cross-defendant's motion to strike the answer and cross-complaint. The motion was filed by Eduardo Luna, the plaintiff and cross-defendant, arguing that Villa Patrician Home Owner's Association, Inc. (Villa HOA) is a suspended California business entity and therefore cannot defend itself in this action, and that Villa HOA 2 is not authorized to act pursuant to the subject CC&Rs. The court granted the motion to strike the answer filed by Villa HOA because it is a suspended entity and cannot defend itself, but denied the motion to strike the cross-complaint filed by Villa HOA 2. The court also denied the request for judicial notice of exhibit 1 because there was no evidence showing that the CC&Rs were recorded. The court ordered that the answer filed by Villa HOA is stricken, and that the cross-complaint filed by Villa HOA 2 is not stricken.
