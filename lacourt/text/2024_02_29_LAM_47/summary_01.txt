And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to deem the truth of matters in requests for admissions and a request for sanctions. The motion is denied as moot, conditioned on the defendants serving revised copies of their proposed responses to the requests for admissions without objections within 10 days. If the defendants fail to serve the revised responses, the motion will be granted. The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $3,186.65, finding that the fee request is unreasonably inflated and that the totality of the circumstances, including the service of the discovery requests on counsel at a time when counsel of record was hospitalized, do not warrant the imposition of sanctions.
