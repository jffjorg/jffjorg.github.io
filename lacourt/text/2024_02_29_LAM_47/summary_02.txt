And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to set aside the default and default judgment entered against them. The defendants claimed that their failure to timely respond to the complaint was due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, specifically stating that they provided an incorrect zip code and omitted the second page of their fee waiver application, which led to their rejection of subsequent filings. The court finds good cause to set aside the default and default judgment and permit the filing of the proposed motion to quash service of summons. The court sets a hearing on the motion to quash service of summons for March 27, 2024, and orders the parties to serve their opposition and reply papers according to code.
