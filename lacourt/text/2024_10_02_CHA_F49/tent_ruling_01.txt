attorney of record in the amount of $3,400.00.
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is GRANTED. The request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from injuries Plaintiff sustained as a
result of an alleged dog bite incident that occurred on or about October 14,
2021. 
 
On October 12, 2023, Plaintiff Roubik Keshesh (“Plaintiff”
or “Keshesh”) filed the Complaint against Defendants Garnik Sarian (“Sarian”),
Jaklin Simonian (“Simonian”) (collectively, “Defendants”), and Does 1 to 60,
alleging the following causes of action: (1) Premises Liability, (2) General
Negligence, (3) Statutory Strict Liability pursuant to Civil Code Section
3342(a). Subsequently, on December 8, 2023, Defendants filed their Answer to
the Complaint. 
 
On July 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One (the “Motion”).
Subsequently, Defendant Sarian filed his Opposition on September 19, 2024, and
Plaintiff replied on September 24, 2024. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
“On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the
propounding party deems that any of the following apply: (1) An answer to a
particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. (2) An exercise of the
option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the
required specification of those documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subd. (a).)
 
A.   
Procedural
Requirements 
 
1.     
Timeliness
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300,
subdivision (c), notice of this motion must be given within 45 days following
the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or
by a later date agreed-upon in writing, failing which the propounding party
waives any right to compel a further response to the interrogatories. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (c); but see Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc.
v. Superior Court (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127, 134-136 [suggesting that the
45-day deadline does not apply to (i.e., it does not begin to run with service
of) objections-only responses; it only applies to responses that are required
to be verified].)
 
The 45-day deadline “is ‘jurisdictional’
in the sense that it renders the court without authority to rule on motions to
compel other than to deny them.” (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
Here, Plaintiff’s counsel,
Breanna K. Martinez (“Martinez”), attests that on May 20, 2024, Defendant
served, via email, his responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set One,
on Plaintiff. (Martinez Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. “2.”) This service established the
45-day deadline as July 6, 2024. On July 25, 2024, Plaintiff granted Sarian an
extension to provide further responses by July 9, 2024. (Id. ¶ 9.) In
exchange, Defendant Sarian respond on June 26, 2024, granting Plaintiff an
extension to file motions to compel by July 18, 2024. (Ibid.)
 
By contrast, Defendant Sarian contends that he never agreed
to extend Plaintiff’s deadline to move to compel with respect to the subject
form interrogatories, arguing that the instant Motion is untimely. (Avakian
Decl. ¶ 7, Opp’n. at p. 3.)
 
In responses, Plaintiff’s counsel, Christienne M. Papa
(“Papa”), presents an email from Defendant Sarian’s counsel, Armen Avakian
(“Avakian”), dated June 26, 2024. (Papa Decl. Ex. “9.”) The email indicates
that Avakian emailed Plaintiff’s counsel, Martinez, on June 26, 2024, stating
“I asked for more time so you offered to give until July 9 to provide the
further responses and responses to your special rogs and RFPDSs, set two, in
exchange for an extension to file motion to compel regarding my responses to set
one through July 23.... If I get 7 days, you get 7 days. So July 9 for me
and July 18 for you. Deal?” (Papa Decl. Ex. “9.”) (Underlines added.) On
the same day, Martinez replied to the email, stating, “Yes, that’s fine.” (Ibid.)
 
Significantly, the “July 9, 2024” extended deadline for
Sarian’s supplemental responses was offered in Martinez’s June 25, 2024, email,
which states, “I can give you until July 9, 2024 to provide further responses
to both sets of discovery, so long as our motion to compel deadline for Form
Interrogatories, ... is similarly extended[.]” (Papa Decl. Ex. “9.”)
(Underlines added.)
 
The Court finds that it is evident an extension for
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses was negotiated and granted in
exchange for “7 extra days” “mutual extension” for Defendant’s supplemental
responses. 
 
Here, the Motion was filed on July 18, 2028, meeting the
extended deadline agreed-upon by the parties in writing. Accordingly, the Court
finds Defendant’s contention that the Motion should fail due to untimeliness
unpersuasive.
 
Therefore, the Court determines that the Motion is
timely.  
 
2.      Meet
and Confer 
 
“A motion under subdivision (a) shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b)(1).) “A meet and confer declaration in
support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith
attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff has satisfied the meet
and confer requirement. (Martinez Decl., ¶¶ 5-8.)
 
3.      Separate
Statement
 
The California Rules of Court rule
3.1345 (a)(2) explicitly states that “Any motion involving the content of a
discovery request or the responses to such a request must be accompanied by a
separate statement. The motions that require a separate statement include a
motion: ... (2) To compel further responses to interrogatories[.]” “A separate
statement is a separate document filed and served with the discovery motion
that provides all the information necessary to understand each discovery
request and all the responses to it that are at issue.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1345(c).)
 
Here, Plaintiff has fulfilled the
requirement by concurrently filing a separate statement with the Motion.
 
B.    
Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further responses on the grounds
that Defendant’s initial responses to the first set of Form Interrogatories
(“FROGs”) are evasive, nonresponsive, and incomplete.
 
As to FROGs Nos. 16.2, 16.3, 16.4,
16.5, and 16.6, Defendant Sarian provided uniformed responses, stating, “This interrogatory is premature because Responding
Party has not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and
investigation regarding the nature or extent of plaintiff’s alleged injuries
and damages. Discovery and investigation are ongoing. Responding Party reserves
the right to revise, modify, amend or otherwise supplement this response at a
later date.” (See generally, Pl.’s Separate Statement.)
 
The Court notes
that a party may use
interrogatories to request the identity and location of those with knowledge of
discoverable matters. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.010.) To show an interrogatory
seeks relevant, discoverable information “is not the burden of [the party
propounding interrogatories]. As a litigant, it is entitled to demand answers
to its interrogatories, as a matter of right, and without a prior showing,
unless the party on whom those interrogatories are served objects and shows
cause why the questions are not within the purview of the code section.” (Williams
v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531,.541, citing West Pico Furniture
Co. v. Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 422.)
 
Here, Sarian’s generic objections based
on relevance, vagueness, and overbreadth are inconsistent with the fact that
the Judicial Council of California drafted the form interrogatories, and there
is a presumption that FROGs are valid.
 
Furthermore, Sarian’s argument that the
FROGs are premature is not well-founded. The action commenced since October 12,
2023, and Sarian first appeared in the case on December 8, 2023. Plaintiff
provided his responses to Defendant’s discovery on February 27, 2024. (Martinez
Decl. Ex. “3.”) Therefore, the Court finds that Defendant Sarian had sufficient
information and reasonable opportunities to conduct an investigation or
discovery of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages. 
 
Accordingly, the Court finds Sarian’s
generic objections, including that discovery was “premature,” inapplicable.
 
As to
FROGs Nos. 16.9 and 16.10, Sarian’s responses cite mere objections, stating
“Objection. Responding Party objects to this interrogatory on the grounds that
the term “incident” is not defined such that there can be no meaningful
response without speculation, it is overly broad, vague and ambiguous, calls
for speculation, improperly seeks information and documentation protected by
the attorney-client and attorney work product privileges, and violates Evidence
Code §769.” (Pl.’s Separate Statement, at pp. 8-9.)
 
Established case law holds that a
responding party may object to an interrogatory that seeks privileged information by clearly stating the objection and the
particular privilege invoked. But the existence of a
document containing privileged information is not privileged. (Smith v. Superior Court (1961) 189 Cal.App.2d 6, 12.)
(Underlines added.) Interrogatories
may be used to discover the existence of documents in the other party's
possession. If an interrogatory asks the responding party to identify a document,
an adequate response must include a description of the document. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 783.)
 
            Here, the Court finds FROGs Nos.
16.9 and 16.10 inquire about the existence of documents. If Defendant does not
have information requested, he could simply reply in the negative to the
request as permitted. If Sarian raise valid objections based on privilege, he
is otherwise required to include a description of the document.
 
            Accordingly, the Court finds
Sarian’s mere assertion of privilege objection, without provide any descriptive
information, does not sufficiently respond to the interrogatories aimed at
discovering the existence of documents in his possession. 
 
            Based on the foregoing, the Court
GRANTS the Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One. 
 
C.   
Monetary
Sanctions
 
Beltran also requests the imposition of monetary
sanctions in the amount of $3,400.00, against Defendant Sarian and his attorney
of record, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, which states,
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to interrogatories,
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”
 
Given that the Court has previously
granted the Motion and no substantial justification exists to exempt the mandatory
monetary sanction, the Court finds
that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for
the work in preparing the Motion is $1,110.00, calculated at a reasonable hourly rate of $350.00 for three hours reasonably spent, plus
$60.00 for filing fees. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff Roubik Keshesh’s Motion to Compel Further
Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, is GRANTED.
 
Defendant Garnik Sarian is ordered
to produce
supplemental responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 16.2,
16.3, 16.4, 16.5, 16.6, 16.9, and 16.10, within 20 days.
 
Plaintiff Roubik Keshesh’s Request for Monetary Sanctions
is GRANTED IN PART.
 
Defendant Garnik Sarian and his attorney of record are
ordered, jointly and severally, to pay $1,110.00 to Plaintiff within 20 days.
