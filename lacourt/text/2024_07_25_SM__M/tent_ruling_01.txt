for Summary Judgment/Adjudication 
HEARING DATE:   7/25/2024

 
Legal
Standard
 
A party may move for summary judgment in any action or proceeding
if it is contended the action has no merit or that there is no defense to the
action or proceeding. (CCP, § 437c(a).) “The purpose of the law of summary
judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties'
pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in
fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  
 
“A party may move for summary adjudication as to one or
more causes of action within an action, one or more affirmative defenses, one
or more claims for damages, or one or more issues of duty, if the party
contends that the cause of action has no merit, that there is no affirmative
defense to the cause of action, that there is no merit to an affirmative
defense as to any cause of action, that there is no merit to a claim for
damages, as specified in¿Section 3294 of the Civil Code, or that one or more defendants
either owed or did not owe a duty to the plaintiff or plaintiffs.”¿(CCP,¿§
437c(f)(1).)¿If a party seeks summary adjudication as an alternative to a
request for summary judgment, the request must be clearly made in the notice of
the motion. (Gonzales v. Superior Court¿(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1542,
1544.)¿ “[A] party may move for summary adjudication of a legal issue or a
claim for damages other than punitive damages that does not completely
dispose of a cause of action, affirmative defense, or issue of duty
pursuant to” subdivision (t). (CCP,¿§ 437c(t).)¿ 
 
To prevail, the evidence submitted must show there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.¿(CCP, §¿437c(c).)¿The motion cannot succeed unless
the evidence leaves no room for conflicting inferences as to material facts;
the court has no power to weigh one inference against another or against other
evidence. (Murillo v. Rite Stuff Food Inc. (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th
833, 841.) In determining whether the facts give rise to a triable issue of
material fact, “[a]ll doubts as to whether any material, triable, issues of
fact exist are to be resolved in favor of the party opposing summary judgment…”
(Gold v. Weissman (2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1195, 1198-99.) “In other
words, the facts alleged in the evidence of the party opposing summary judgment
and the reasonable inferences there from must be accepted as true.” (Jackson
v. County of Los Angeles (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 171, 179.) However, if
adjudication is otherwise proper the motion “may not be denied on grounds of
credibility,” except when¿a material fact is the witness’s¿state of mind and
“that fact is sought to be established solely by the [witness’s] affirmation
thereof.” (CCP, § 437c(e).)¿ 
 
Once the moving party has met their burden, the burden
shifts to the opposing party “to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.” (CCP §
437c(p)(1).) “[T]here¿is no
obligation on the opposing party... to establish anything by affidavit unless
and until the moving party has by affidavit stated facts establishing every
element... necessary to sustain a judgment in his favor.”¿(Consumer Cause,
Inc. v.¿SmileCare¿(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 454, 468.)¿ 
¿ 
“The pleadings play a key role in a summary judgment
motion. The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to
delimit the scope of the issues and to¿frame¿the outer measure of materiality
in a summary judgment proceeding.” (Hutton v. Fidelity National Title Co.¿(2013)
213 Cal.App.4th 486, 493, quotations and citations omitted.) “Accordingly, the
burden of a defendant moving for summary judgment only requires that he or she
negate plaintiff's theories of liability¿as alleged in the complaint;
that is, a moving party need not refute liability on some theoretical
possibility not included in the pleadings.” (Ibid.)¿ 
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiff BMC West, LLC moves for summary
judgment, or in the alternative summary adjudication, in its favor and against
Defendants Visionary Construction Management Partnership Co. and Shahik “Sean”
Baghdasian.
 
Plaintiff dismissed the causes of
action for Quantum Meruit, Foreclosure of Mechanic’s Lien, Enforcement Against
Mechanic’s Lien Release Bond and Recovery on Contractors License Bond. The only
remaining causes of action are the Breach of Contract, Account Stated and Open
Book Account against Visionary, and the Recovery on Personal Guarantee against
Baghdasian. Plaintiff argues that Visionary is liable on the first (breach of
contract), second (account stated) and fourth (open book) causes of action, and
that Baghdasian is liable on the eighth cause of action (personal guarantee). 
 
“[T]he elements of a cause of
action for breach of contract are (1) the existence of the contract, (2)
plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach,
and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff. [Citation.]” (Oasis West
Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821.)  
 
“The essential elements of an
account stated are: (1) previous transactions between the parties establishing
the relationship of debtor and creditor; (2) an agreement between the parties,
express or implied, on the amount due from the debtor to the creditor; (3) a
promise by the debtor, express or implied, to pay the amount due. [Citations.]”
(Zinn v. Fred R. Bright Co. (1969) 271 Cal.App2d 597, 600.) 
 
The elements for recovery on an
open book are: 1) a statement which constitutes the principal record of one or
more transactions between a debtor and a creditor arising out of a contract or
some fiduciary relation; 2) shows the debits and credits in connection
therewith, and against whom and in favor of whom entries are made; 3) entered
in the regular course of business as conducted by such creditor or fiduciary;
4) kept in a reasonably permanent form and manner; and 5) in a bound book, on a
sheet or sheets fastened in a book or to backing but detachable therefrom, on a
card or cards of a permanent character, or is kept in any other reasonably
permanent form and manner. (CCP §337a [book account defined]; Tsemetzin v.
Coast Federal Savings & Loan Assn. (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1334, 1343;
see CACI 372.) 
 
BMC and Visionary entered into a
written contract to purchase materials from BMC on a credit basis for a
construction project located at 425 East 5th Street, Long Beach, CA 90802
(“Project”). (UMF 3, 8.) Baghdasian signed a personal guarantee, unconditionally
guaranteeing and promising to pay any and all indebtedness of Visionary to BMC
for purchased materials. (UMF 4, 6-7.) The written contract and guarantee allow
for interest at 18% and attorney’s fees. (UMF 5.)
 
Between July 2021, and October
2021, Visionary ordered materials from BMC for the construction project. (UMF
8.) BMC invoiced Visionary for the principal sum of $152,764.54. (UMF 10.) Visionary
had access to its running balance with BMC and invoices throughout the Project
via an online platform. (UMF 11-12.) Baghdasian confirmed that (a) the BMC
invoices are undisputed (UMF 13, 18, 19); (b) Visionary approved BMC’s invoices
and passed them on to the owner and lender for payment (UMF 14-16); (c) BMC
does not owe Visionary any credit for the materials (UMF 17); and (d) that the
only reason for non-payment is that Visionary was not paid (UMF 20). Visionary’s
bookkeeper testified that prior to the lawsuit, Visionary did not inform BMC of
any dispute regarding the outstanding balance and has no reason to think that
BMC’s job statement reflecting a balance of $152,764.54 is inaccurate. (UMF 18,
21.) 
 
The credit application provides
that balances not paid bear a service charge at the rate of 18% per annum from
the date the payment is due. (UMF 5.) BMC calculates interest as $10,848.38 (from
October 31, 2021, through March 25, 2022) and $31,376.53 (from March 26, 2022,
through July 25, 2024). (Manley Decl., ¶ 21.) 
 
In April 2022, BMC settled with Defendant
Horizon Mesa LLC. (UMF 14, 25.) BMC received $78,000 from Horizon and applies
that amount towards the principal amount owed by Visionary. (Id.) Defendants’ remaining
principal balance due and owing is therefore $74,764.54.
 
Plaintiff has demonstrated the prima
facie elements for breach of contract, account stated and book account against
Defendants. Plaintiff submits undisputed evidence of the subject credit
agreement and personal guarantee. Plaintiff demonstrates that they performed on
the contract by providing the credit. Plaintiff shows the record of invoices in
support of their claims, kept in a reasonably permanent manner. It is further
undisputed that Defendants breached their agreements by failing to pay back all
amounts owed. In sum, Plaintiff demonstrates damages of $116,989.44, including
principal and interest through July 25, 2024. Plaintiff requests that the
amount of attorney’s fees be determined by a post judgment motion. Plaintiff thereby
meets its burden of production.
 
Defendants claim that Plaintiff has
failed to meet its burden. First, Defendants assert that there is a triable
issue as to the value of the alleged delivered materials. (UMF 9, 10, 13,
19-23, 26, 35, 36, 39, 45 – 49, 52, 61, 62, 65, 71 – 75, 78, 87, 88, 91, 97 –
101, 104, 113, 114, 117, 123 – 127, 130, 139, 140, 143, 149 – 153 & 156.) Defendants
do not cite which documents, if any, contain discrepancies. Defendants also
contend in the separate statement that the invoices presented add up to
$147,423.08 instead of $152,764.54. Defendants cite the declaration of Bryan Manley
at paragraphs 15-16, but do not explain the calculations that support this
alleged discrepancy. Furthermore, any discrepancies with the invoices would not
dispute the deposition testimony re: invoices (exhibit 4) or the billing
statements (exhibit 6).  Thus, there is
no disputed fact as the value of the materials.
 
Defendants further claim there is a
triable issue as to whether Baghdasian signed a personal guarantee. (UMF 6, 7,
32, 33, 58, 59, 84, 85, 110, 111, 136, 137, and 156.) Plaintiff submitted
overlapping evidence supporting the material facts that there was an agreement
between Defendants and Plaintiff, such as deposition testimony where
Defendants’ witnesses admit to the existence of the agreements and accuracy of
the invoices. Defendants also contend that there is a triable issue on the
precise terms of the alleged personal guarantee, as the presented guaranty is
illegible. (UMF 6, 7, 32, 33, 58, 59, 84, 85, 110, 111, 136, 137, and 156.) To
the contrary, Plaintiff supplied legible copies of the guarantee. (See Manley
Decl., Ex. 2A.)  The record demonstrates
that there is no dispute that Baghdasian signed the personal guarantee.
 
Other than the above-described
contentions, Defendants assert the existence of a triable, material factual on Defendants’
impossibility and/or impracticability defense. (AMF 157-169).  A contract or term that is “impossible” to
fulfill is void. (Civ. Code § 1441.) The promised performance must be
impossible by its nature, not that the individual party cannot do it. (1
Witkin, Summary of California Law, Contracts § 855.) Performance may be excused
when performance is not literally impossible but is made impractical due to
excessive and unreasonable difficulty or expense. (Habitat Trust for
Wildlife, Inc. v. City of Rancho Cucamonga (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1306,
1336; see Mineral Park Land Co. v. Howard (1916) 172 Cal. 289, 293 [performance
impracticable where the cost of performing was 10 times greater than
anticipated].) “This does not mean that a party can avoid performance simply
because it is more costly than anticipated or results in a loss.” (Habitat
Trust, 175 Cal.App.4th at 1336.) Defenses of frustration of purpose,
impossibility, and impracticability are decided as questions of law (Oosten
v. Hay Haulers Dairy Employees and Helpers Union (1955) 45 Cal.2d 784, 788.)
 
Defendants provide that Visionary
provided, labor, materials and services pursuant to the subject contract. Horizon
Mesa, LLC agreed to pay for these materials and services according to their
contract. (AMF 157.) Prior to signing the contract on April 19, 2021, Horizon
Mesa, LLC represented to Visionary that it had bank funding approved for the
full contract amount. (AMF 158.) Despite their representation to Defendants, Horizon
Mesa, LLC did not have full bank funding approved for the entire contract
amount. (AMF 159.) Horizon Mesa, LLC demanded that Visionary sign a contract
for a lesser amount. (AMF 160.) When Visionary refused, Horizon terminated
Visionary from the project and refused to pay Visionary for the work completed
at the project. (AMF 161.) Visionary filed a Cross-Complaint in this action,
and in the related action, against Horizon Mesa, LLC. (AMF 161.)
 
Defendants argue that their failure
to pay was due to Horizon’s failure to pay. Defendants contend that this
failure and their termination was not foreseeable because Horizon agreed to pay
and assured that the project had full funding. (AMF 162.) Defendants assert
that Horizon’s failures made payment to BMC impossible and impracticable. (AMF
164.) Visionary assures the Court that had Horizon paid for the services
performed, Visionary could have, and would have, paid Plaintiff. (AMF 165.)
 
There is no impossibility or
impracticability presented by this record. Defendants present no authority supporting
their position that difficulties funding repayment of their credit would render
their repayment impracticable in any scenario, let alone in the real estate
contracting context. Courts have generally required a higher degree of
unreasonable and unforeseeable difficulty and expense. For example, in Habitat
Trust, a developer had entered into contract with non-profit land trust and
environmental advocacy group that created trust, under which developer agreed
to convey land to trust to mitigate environmental impacts of development
project. (Habitat Trust, supra, 175 Cal.App.4th.) The court found that
the developer met its burden on summary judgment as to an impossibility/impracticability
issue where their evidence showed their performance would require them convey
86 acres of land and over $570,000 to Habitat Trust without complying with
City's conditions to build the development. (Id. at 1336-1337) An
essential purpose of the agreement was to satisfy mitigation condition by
transferring mitigation land to Habitat Trust, and that purpose could not be
fulfilled because of the City’s unexpected determination that Habitat Trust did
not qualify to hold the mitigation land. (Ibid.) In light of the legal
impossibility of the transfer, among other things, the appellate court upheld
the trial court’s granting of summary judgment in favor of the developer.
 
Here, there is no analogous
unexpected frustration by a legislative act, or multifold increase in expense.
Defendants do not present any evidence that they could not otherwise pay the
outstanding invoices. Further, Horizon’s termination of Defendants was a
reasonably foreseeable outcome of the contract. The contracting parties did
foresee such a circumstance, as shown by the “for cause” or “for convenience” termination
clauses. Therefore, Defendants fail to support their affirmative defenses, and
fail to meet their burden on opposition. 
 
Accordingly, the motion for summary
judgment is GRANTED. Judgment will be entered in favor of Plaintiff, against
Defendants, in the amount of $116,989.44. Plaintiff requests that the amount of
attorney’s fees be determined by a post judgment motion.
