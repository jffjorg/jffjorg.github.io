And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment/summary adjudication against the defendants, Visionary Construction Management Partnership Co. and Shahik "Sean" Baghdasian. The plaintiff, BMC West, LLC, has demonstrated the prima facie elements for breach of contract, account stated, and book account against the defendants. The defendants have failed to meet their burden of production and have not presented any evidence to support their affirmative defenses of impossibility and impracticability.

The court has found that the defendants' failure to pay the outstanding invoices was not due to any unforeseen circumstances, but rather was a result of their own breach of contract. The court has also found that the defendants have failed to present any evidence that would support their contention that payment was impossible or impracticable.

As a result, the court has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment/summary adjudication and has entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff against the defendants in the amount of $116,989.44. The plaintiff has also requested that the amount of attorney's fees be determined by a post-judgment motion.
