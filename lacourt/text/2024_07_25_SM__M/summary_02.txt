And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel arbitration in this case. The defendants, Mitchell Silberberg & Knupp LLP and individual defendants, contend that plaintiff Natalie Serrano signed an arbitration agreement upon commencement of her employment with MSK. The agreement covers all legal or equitable claims against MSK, including the claims brought by Serrano in this matter.

The judge finds that the defendants have met their burden to demonstrate the existence of an arbitration agreement between the parties that covers Serrano's claims. Serrano has not opposed the motion, and therefore has not met her burden to show any defense to the arbitration agreement.

The judge orders that Serrano's claims be arbitrated, and stays the entire action pending the completion of the arbitration. A status conference re arbitration is set for April 10, 2025, at 8:30 a.m.
