And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge continues the hearing on Meta Housing Corporation's motion to compel Vincent Kennedy to appear for a further deposition and answer questions. Meta seeks to compel Kennedy to answer questions about the death of Bonny Dodd, who was allegedly attacked by a fellow resident. Kennedy has not filed an answer or otherwise appeared in the case. The judge notes that Kennedy was not properly served with the motion by mail, and that personal service is required since Kennedy has not appeared in the action. The judge gives Meta 60 days to cure this procedural defect and arrange for timely and proper service on Kennedy.
