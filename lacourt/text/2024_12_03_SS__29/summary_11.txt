And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The motion was incomplete because it lacked a supporting declaration and proposed order, and it was not filed and served in a timely manner. Additionally, there is no proof of service on the plaintiff. The judge notes that the motion was also incomplete in that item 4 of the notice of motion and motion was not completed correctly. The judge orders the moving counsel to give notice and denies the motion without prejudice.
