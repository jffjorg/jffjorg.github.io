And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the motion of Plaintiff's Counsel, Angel Silva and Aaron Brown, to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The motion was incomplete, as it lacked a supporting declaration and a proposed order, and was also filed late. Additionally, there was no proof of service of the motion on the Plaintiff. The Judge notes that the requisite forms must be served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case, and that the court may delay the effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service is filed.
