And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to dismiss the case filed by Bank of America, the defendant, based on a delay in prosecution. The plaintiff, April Marie Brown, filed a complaint in pro per against the bank and others in February 2023. The bank filed its answer in June 2023, and the plaintiff filed a request for dismissal of the entire action in August 2024. However, the request was not completed correctly, and the dismissal was not entered. The bank then filed the motion to dismiss in November 2024, claiming that the case has not been brought to trial or conditionally settled within two years after the action was commenced.

The judge notes that the bank served the motion electronically, but this is not proper service on a pro per plaintiff. The plaintiff must consent to electronic service, and no such consent has been filed with the court. Therefore, the judge is denying the motion without prejudice, meaning that the bank can refile the motion later.
