21STCV45288
Defendant’s Motion for Leave to File Amended Answer
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice.
Background
On
 December 13, 2021, Veronica Dresden
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Bryan Luben, individually and dba Catering
by Bryan (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 50, asserting causes of action for
premises liability and general negligence arising out of an alleged slip and
fall on December 17, 2019.
 
On
January 18, 2024, Defendant filed an answer and cross-complaint against
Neutrogena Corporation and Roes 1 through 50. 
 
On
May 9, 2024, Defendant amended the cross-complaint to name Johns & Johnson
Services, Inc. as Roe 1. 
 
On
May 13, 2024, the Court, at the request of Defendant, dismissed the causes of
action in the cross-complaint asserted against Neutrogena Corporation.
 
On September 25, 2024, Defendant filed this motion for
leave to file an amended answer. No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Authority 
 
CCP §
473(a)(1) provides, in relevant part: 
“The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be
proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking
out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party,
or a mistake in any other respect; and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time
for answer or demurrer.  The court may
likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any
terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other
particulars; and may upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time
limited by this code.”  
 
“This
discretion should be exercised liberally in favor of amendments, for judicial
policy favors resolution of all disputed matters in the same lawsuit.”  (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior Court
(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1047.) 
Ordinarily, the court will not consider the validity of the proposed
amended pleading in ruling on a motion for leave since grounds for a demurrer
or motion to strike are premature.  The
court, however, does have discretion to deny leave to amend where a proposed
amendment fails to state a valid cause of action as a matter of law and the
defect cannot be cured by further amendment. 
(See California Casualty General Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985)
173 Cal.App.3d 274, 281, overruled on other grounds by Kransco v. American
Empire Surplus Lines Ins. Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 390.) 
 
Under
CRC Rule 3.1324(a), a motion to amend a pleading shall (1) include a copy of
the proposed amendment or amended pleading, which must be serially numbered to
differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments; (2) state what
allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any, and
where, by page, paragraph and line number, the deleted allegations are located;
and (3) state what allegations are proposed to be added to the previous
pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the
additional allegations are located.  
 
Under
CRC Rule 3.1324(b), a separate declaration must accompany the motion and must
specify (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and
proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were
discovered; and (4) the reasons why the request for amendment was not made
earlier.  
 
Even if
a good amendment is proposed in proper form, a long, unwarranted and unexcused
delay in presenting it may be a good reason for denial.  In most cases, the factors for timeliness
are: (1) lack of diligence in discovering the facts or in offering the
amendment after knowledge of them; and (2) the effect of the delay on the
adverse party.  If the party seeking the
amendment has been dilatory, and the delay has prejudiced the opposing party,
the judge has discretion to deny leave to amend.  (Hirsa v. Superior Court (1981) 118
Cal.App.3d 486, 490.)  Prejudice exists
where the amendment would require delaying the trial, resulting in loss of
critical evidence, or added costs of preparation such as an increased burden of
discovery.  (Magpali v. Farmers Group,
Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488.) 
 
Discussion
 
Defendants
request leave to amend their answer to add affirmative defenses relating to negligence
of Plaintiff’s employer. (Carron Decl., ¶ 7.) 
 
Defendant
has included a copy of the proposed amended answer. (Id., ¶ 6, Exh. E.) 
 
Under
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(b), a declaration must be provided to
show (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and
proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were
discovered; and (4) the reasons why the request for amendment was not made
earlier.  
 
Defense
counsel’s declaration addresses the effect of the amendment, counsel does not
address the remaining topics required under California Rules of Court, rule
3.1324(b).
 
Accordingly,
the motion is denied without prejudice, as Defendant has not addressed
requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(b).
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES without prejudice Defendant’s motion for
leave to file an amended answer. 
 
Moving
Party is to give notice.
