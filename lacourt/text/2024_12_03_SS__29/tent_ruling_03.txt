 Case Number:  22STCV02522    Hearing Date:   December 3, 2024    Dept:  29 Tsai v. Akins
22STCV02522
Defendant’s Motion for Order Deeming Plaintiff to Have Admitted the Truth of
the Matters Specified in Requests for Admission (Set One)
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice. 
Background
On January 21, 2022, Emily Tsai (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Joan Akins (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 50 for negligence
arising out of an alleged automobile accident on January 22, 2020.
 
On November 21, 2023, Defendant filed an answer.
 
On November 7, 2024, Defendant filed this
motion for an order deeming Plaintiff to have admitted the truth of the matters
specified in Defendant’s Requests for Admission (Set One).  Defendant also seeks sanctions. 
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision
(d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to
respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
Discussion
Code of Civil Procedure section 1005
requires motions be served and filed 16 court days before the hearing. Sixteen court
days before this December 3, 2024 hearing was November 6, 2024; Defendant
served and filed this motion on November 7, 2024.
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied
without prejudice.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE
Defendant’s Motion for a Deemed-Admitted Order. 
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give
notice.
