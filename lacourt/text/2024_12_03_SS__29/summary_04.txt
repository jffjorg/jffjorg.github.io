The judge is denying the motion to be relieved as counsel without prejudice due to untimely filing and service. The motion was filed on November 7, 2024, and the last day to file and serve it was November 6, 2024. The court does not need to consider whether electronic service of the motion on the client is valid. The judge is ordering the moving counsel to give notice of the denial.
