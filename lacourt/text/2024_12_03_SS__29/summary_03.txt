```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant's motion for an order deeming the plaintiff to have admitted the truth of the matters specified in requests for admission is denied without prejudice. The plaintiff failed to respond to the defendant's requests for admission, and the defendant is entitled to an order deeming the truth of those matters admitted. However, because the defendant filed the motion one court day late, the court denies the motion without prejudice. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the court's ruling. The court also notes that it is mandatory to impose a monetary sanction on the party or attorney who failed to serve a timely response to the requests for admission, but the court does not impose such a sanction in this case.
