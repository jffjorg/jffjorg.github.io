Legal Standard
The court on its
own motion or on motion of the defendant may dismiss an action under Code of
Civil Procedure sections 583.410-583.430 for delay in prosecution if the action
has not been brought to trial or conditionally settled within two years after
the action was commenced against the defendant.¿ (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.134(a).)¿ 
 
Discussion
Defendant brings
this motion to dismiss under Code of Civil Procedure section 583.410 and
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1342. 
Defendant served

(3) provides:
“An unrepresented party may consent to
receive electronic service.
Express consent to electronic service may
be given by either of the following:
(i) Serving a notice on all parties
and filing the notice with the court.
(ii) Manifesting affirmative consent
through electronic means with the court or the court’s electronic filing
service provider, and concurrently providing the party’s electronic address
with that consent for the purpose of receiving electronic service. The act of
electronic filing shall not be construed as express consent.”
No proof of consent to electronic service has been filed with
the Court.
Accordingly, the Court must deny this motion without prejudice.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE Defendant
Bank of America, N.A.’s motion to dismiss this action.
