Summary in English:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion filed by Meta Housing Corporation to compel Vincent Kennedy, the cross-defendant, to appear for a further deposition and answer questions. The motion was filed on October 23, 2024, and no opposition has been filed. The Judge has continued the hearing on the motion for approximately 60 days to give Meta the opportunity to cure a procedural defect in the service of the motion. The defect is that Kennedy was served with the motion by mail, which is not proper service. The Judge has ordered Meta to provide notice to all parties and arrange for timely and proper service on Kennedy.
