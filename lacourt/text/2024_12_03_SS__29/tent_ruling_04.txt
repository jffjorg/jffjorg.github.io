 Case Number:  22STCV31520    Hearing Date:   December 3, 2024    Dept:  29 Valenzuela v. Stadco LA, LLC
22STCV31520
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s
Counsel Ilia Borisov and Arash H. Zabetian of Martinian Lawyers, Inc.
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice for
untimely filing and service,
Background
On September 26, 2022, Dehnys Valenzuela
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Stadco LA, LLC., Hollywood Park Land
Company, LLC, and Does 1 to 10 for premises liability arising out of an
incident on August 20, 2022, in which Plaintiff was allegedly attacked by other
attendees of an event at Sofi Stadium.
On April 28, 2023, Stadco LA, LLC and Hollywood
Park Management Company, LLC filed an answer to the complaint.
On April 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
substitution of attorney.
By Minute Order dated September 25, 2024, the Court denied,
without prejudice, a prior motion of counsel to be relieved.
Approximately six weeks later, on November 7, 2024, Ilia Borisov and Arash H. Zabetian of Martinian Lawyers,
Inc. (“Counsel”) filed this motion to be relieved
as counsel for Plaintiff. 
No opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or substituted at
any time before or after judgment or final determination upon request by either
client or attorney and after notice from one to the other. (Code of Civ. Proc.,
§ 284, subd. (b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where conflicts
between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies within
the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior
Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial
Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.136(c)), and
MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e)).   
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client and all
other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel filed
this motion, along with the supporting declaration and proposed order on November
7, 2024.  According to the proof of
service filed with the Court, the client was served by email on November 6.
This is not
timely filing or service.  Motions must
be filed and served at least 16 court days before the hearing.  For a hearing on December 3, 2024, the last
day to file and serve (assuming personal service) was November 6.  For mail service, five additional days are
added.  For electronic service, two
additional days are added – assuming that electronic service is valid.
Filing on
November 7 was untimely.  Electronic
service – even assuming that electronic service is valid – on November 6 was
not timely.
Accordingly, the
motion is denied without prejudice.
The Court need
not reach, and does not reach, the issue of whether electronic service of this
motion on the client is valid service. 
Counsel has not filed a declaration that the electronic service address
is Plaintiff’s current email address in accordance with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d)(2). 
Conclusion
The Court DENIES
WITHOUT PREJUDICE the motion to be relieved as counsel.
Moving counsel
is ordered to give notice.
