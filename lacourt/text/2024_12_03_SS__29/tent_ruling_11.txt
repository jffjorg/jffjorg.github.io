 Case Number:  23STCV05748    Hearing Date:   December 3, 2024    Dept:  29 Smith v. Global Paratransit, Inc.
23STCV05748
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s
Counsel Angel Silva and Aaron Brown of California Trial Team, P.C.
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice.
Background
On March 15, 2023, Pinky Smith (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Global Paratransit, Inc., Esmeralda Herrera (collectively
“Defendants”), and Does 1 through 100 for motor vehicle negligence arising out
of an alleged accident on April 28, 2022.
On June 2, 2023, Defendants filed an answer.
On November 8,
2024 Angel Silva and Aaron Brown of California Trial
Team, P.C. (“Counsel”) filed this
motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. 
 
No opposition
has been filed.
 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
The motion is
denied without prejudice for at least two independent procedural reasons.
First, Counsel
filed the notice of motion and motion, but Counsel did not file a supporting declaration
or a proposed order, as is required.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.)  The motion is therefore materially
incomplete.
Second, the motion is not timely.  It was filed and served on November 8.  Motions must be
filed and served at least 16 court days before the hearing.  For a hearing on December 3, 2024, the last
day to file and serve (assuming personal service) was November 6.  For mail service, five additional days are
added.  For electronic service, two
additional days are added – assuming that electronic service is valid.
Third, there is
no proof of any service at all on Plaintiff.
The Court also
notes that item 4 of the notice of motion and motion is not completed
correctly.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES
WITHOUT PREJUDICE the motion to be relieved as counsel.
Moving counsel
is ordered to give notice.
