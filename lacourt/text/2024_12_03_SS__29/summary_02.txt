And here is the summary in English text:

The Court has denied, without prejudice, Defendant's motion for leave to file an amended answer. The motion was filed on September 25, 2024, and seeks to add affirmative defenses relating to negligence of Plaintiff's employer. The Court's decision is based on the fact that the motion does not meet the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(b), which requires a declaration to be provided showing the effect of the amendment, why the amendment is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered, and the reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier. The Court's decision is also influenced by the fact that Defendant has not been diligent in presenting the proposed amendment, and the delay may prejudice the Plaintiff.
