23STCV05509
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Cross-Defendant to Answer Questions at Deposition
Tentative
The hearing on the motion is continued.
Background
On March 13, 2023, Lacey Dodd (individually and as
executor of the estate of Bonny Dodd), Natthan Dodd, and Deric Dodd
(collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Meta Housing Corporation,
Buckingham Senior Apartments, LLC, Buckingham Senior Apartments, L.P.,
Buckingham Place Senior Housing, L.P., and Does 1 through 100, asserting causes
of action for wrongful death and negligence arising out of the death of Bonny
Dodd, who was allegedly attacked by a fellow resident. 
 
On June 15, 2023, Meta Housing Corporation (“Meta”) filed
an answer to the complaint.  On the same
date, Meta filed a cross-complaint against Vincent Kennedy  (“Kennedy”) and Roes 1 through 50.
 
Kennedy has not filed an answer or otherwise appeared.
 
On June 16, 2023, the Court, at the request of
Plaintiffs, dismissed all causes of action in the complaint asserted against Buckingham
Senior Apartments, LLC, Buckingham Senior Apartments, L.P., and Buckingham
Place Senior Housing, L.P.
 
On October 6, 2023, Plaintiffs amended the complaint to
name WSH Management, Inc. (“WSH”) as Doe 1.
 
On February 16, 2024, WSH filed an answer to the
complaint.
 
According to Meta’s counsel. Kennedy pled guilty to the
murder of Bonny Dodd and is serving a life sentence.  (Witzman Decl., ¶ 5.)  Meta issued and served a deposition subpoena
to Kennedy; Kennedy appeared for deposition but refused to answer questions
about the death of Bonny Dodd. (Id., ¶¶ 2, 6-7 & Exhs. 1, 3.)
 
On October 23, 2024, Meta filed this motion for an order
compelling Kennedy to appear for a further deposition and answer questions. 
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
“If a deponent fails to answer any question . . . the party seeking
discovery may move the court for an order compelling that answer or
production.” (Code Civ. Proc, § 2025.480, subd. (a).) “If the court determines
that the answer or production sought is subject to discovery, it shall order
that the answer be given or the production be made on the resumption of the
deposition.” (Id., subd. (i).)  
 
A motion to compel under Code
Civ. Proc., section 2025.480, “…shall be made no later than 60 days after the
completion of the record of the deposition, and shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under
Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480(b).) The 60-day deadline is
mandatory. (Unzipped Apparel, LLC v. Bader (2007)156 Cal.App.4th 123,
136.)  
Discussion
Meta
seeks an order compelling Cross-Defendant Kennedy to
appear for deposition and answer questions. 

 
According
to the proof of service filed with the motion, Kennedy was served with the
motion by mail.  That is not proper
service.  As Kennedy has not appeared in
this action, personal service of the motion is required.  Although he has been named as a party, until
and unless he appears, he is treated as a nonparty for purposes of
service.  (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule
1.6(15) (defining a “party” as “a person
appearing in an action”).) 
 
The
Court continues the hearing on this motion to give Meta the opportunity to cure
this procedural defect. 
 
Conclusion
 
The Court
CONTINUES the hearing on Defendant’s motion for approximately 60 days.
 
Moving party must give notice to all parties
and arrange for timely and proper service on Kennedy.
