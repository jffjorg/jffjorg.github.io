And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied, without prejudice, a motion filed by Plaintiff's counsel, Ilia Borisov and Arash H. Zabetian of Martinian Lawyers, Inc., to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed six weeks after a prior motion was denied, and the court found that it was untimely filed and served. The court notes that motions must be filed and served at least 16 court days before the hearing, and that the motion was filed on November 7, 2024, which was after the deadline. The court also notes that the motion was not properly served on the client and other parties, and that the requisite forms were not filed with the court. As a result, the motion is denied without prejudice, and the moving counsel is ordered to give notice.
