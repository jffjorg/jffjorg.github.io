Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs
Legal Standard 

A
prevailing party is entitled to recover costs as a matter of right. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1032, subds. (a)(4), (b).) Attorney’s fees are also recoverable as
costs when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5,
subd. (a)(10).) A prevailing buyer in a Song-Beverly Act action is entitled to
recover their attorney’s fees and costs under the Act’s express terms. (Civ.
Code, § 1794, subd. (d); see Goglin v. BMW of North America, LLC (2016)
4 Cal.App.5th 462, 464, 471.)
The
Court begins this inquiry “with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours
reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (PLCM Group
v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) From there, the “lodestar figure
may then be adjusted [according to a multiplier enhancement] based on
consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided.” (Ibid.) Relevant
multiplier factors include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions
involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which
the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, [and]
(4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24
Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)
No
specific findings reflecting the court’s calculations for attorney’s fees are
required; the record need only show that the attorney’s fees were awarded
according to the “lodestar” or “touchstone” approach. (Rebney v. Wells Fargo
Bank (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1344, 1349, disagreed with on other grounds in In
re Marriage of Demblewski (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 232, 236, fn. 7
[disagreement as to statement of decision requirements].) The Court has broad
discretion to determine the amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee award, which
will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial
error of law, or necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi
v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-1394.)
Order
Granting Attorney’s Fees and Costs: GRANTED.
Plaintiff
seeks an order awarding him $35,446 in attorney’s fees and $1,322.56 in costs
as a prevailing buyer in this SBA action. (See Mot., p. 9; see also Mot.,
Notice, p. 1.)
I. Reasonable Fee Rate
Plaintiff
seeks fee rates of $695 per hour for counsel Michael Saeedian, $425 per hour
for counsel Chistopher Urner, and $250 per hour for law clerk Jorge Acosta.
Plaintiff supports his request by filing a declaration from Mr. Saeedian, who
provides a brief academic and professional background for Messrs. Saeedian,
Urner, and Acosta. The Saeedian declaration also supports the requested fee
rates by referencing the Laffey Matrix. (Mot., p. 5; Mot., Saeedian Decl., ¶¶
2-5, 11-12.)
In
opposition, Defendants argue that a flat rate of $430 to $450 per hour should
be assigned to Plaintiff’s counsel. (The Court briefly notes that Defendants
appear to direct this argument at counsel Saeedian alone because the fee rates
sought by Plaintiff for counsel Christopher Urner and law clerk Jorge Acosta
are smaller than the rate proposed by Defendants.) Defendants rely on a
Consumer Law Attorney Fee Survey Report to support this fee range. (Opp’n, p.
5.)
In
reply, Plaintiff argues that the Consumer Law Attorney Fee Survey Report is six
years old and outdated and otherwise supports his requested fee rates. (Reply,
pp. 1-2.)
The
Court finds in favor of Plaintiff.
The
rate of $695 per hour for Mr. Saeedian appears reasonable based on comparable
fee rates in the Los Angeles area and based on Mr. Saeedian’s 14 years’
experience as an attorney. (Mot., Saeedian Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.) Defendants make
insufficient arguments to justify a position that Mr. Saeedian’s fee rate
should be reduced based on substandard performance or other metrics meriting
such a reduction.
Because
the rates requested for Messrs. Urner and Acosta were not challenged by
Defendants, the Court accepts fee rates of $425 per hour and $250 per hour for
these individuals, as supported by the Saeedian declaration. (Mot., Saeedian
Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.)
II. Reasonable Hours
Plaintiff
argues that he is entitled to all costs and expenses (including fees) expended
by counsel up through a determination on this motion. The Saeedian declaration
attaches verified billing records showing that Plaintiff’s requested fees of $35,446
are supported by 65.9 hours expended by counsel in this action. (Mot., pp. 7,
8-9; Mot., Saeedian Decl., Ex. A.)
Defendants
argue that recovery for certain hours should be prohibited or reduced. Defendants
argue that the fees sought by Plaintiff are unreasonable based on a comparison
of Plaintiff’s requested fees and Defendants’ own legal fees, which amount to
$9,896.54. Defendants also argue that the hours are excessive for an action
with no depositions, no law and motion, no expert designations or depositions,
and no trial preparation. More specifically, Defendants attack the amounts
billed by Plaintiff’s counsel in relation to filing the Complaint, “rote”
discovery served on Defendants, discovery responses made by Plaintiff, time
spent by counsel reviewing discovery, drafting meet and confer letters,
preparing a mediation brief, and hours expended by counsel after a settlement
was reached by the parties, including the filing of this motion. (Opp’n, pp.
5-8.)
In
reply, Plaintiff supports each category of challenged hours. Plaintiff does not
seek any adjustment to recovery based on the hours expended on reply work for
this motion. (Reply, pp. 2-10; Reply, Urner Decl., ¶ 6.)
The
Court finds in favor of Plaintiff Rullan.
The
Court’s review of the verified billing records shows that the hours expended by
counsel were reasonable as set forth in those records. (See Mot., Saeedian
Decl., Ex. B; see also Horsford v. Board of Trustees of Calif. State Univ.
(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 397 [“[T]rial court abused its discretion in
rejecting wholesale counsels’ verified time records” where “verified time
statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are entitled to credence
in the absence of a clear indication the records are erroneous”].)
III. Multiplier enhancement
No
multiplier enhancement award is sought by Plaintiff Rullan, for which reason
the Court does not further discuss this topic. (See Opp’n, p. 8 [arguing that
the Court should deny any multiplier enhancement].)
IV. Costs
Plaintiff
Rullan attaches a memorandum of costs to his attorney’s fees motion, which
seeks $1,322.56 in costs related to this action. The costs relate to “filing
the complaint, service of process, and electronic filing of documents and
motions.” (Mot., pp. 7-8; Mot., Saeedian Decl., ¶ 19, Ex. B [memo of costs].)
Defendants’
opposition does not mention costs, instead solely seeking to reduce the
requested fees by $14,926. (See Opp’n, p. 8.)
Accordingly,
the Court accepts the costs represented by Plaintiff, which are reasonable
based on their small amount in relation to this litigation, which was settled
approximately one year after Defendants were served with the Complaint.
V. Total Award
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Rullan’s motion and AWARDS him $35,446 in attorney’s
fees and $1,322.56 in costs, for a total recovery of $36,768.56. 

Conclusion
Plaintiff Raul Rullan’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees for Time Actually
Expended and Reasonably Incurred [and Costs] is GRANTED in the amount of $36,768.56.
Defendants Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC and Galpin Jaguar Lincoln, Inc. are jointly
and severally ORDERED to remit these fees and costs to Plaintiff Raul Rullan
within 30 days of this ruling. 
The Court will set an OSC re: dismissal of this action at a time convenient
to both parties.
