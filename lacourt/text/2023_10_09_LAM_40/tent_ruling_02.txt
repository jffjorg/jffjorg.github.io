Background
Plaintiff Maria Rivero sues Defendants County of Los Angeles, Nancy
Canosa, and Does 1 to 10 pursuant to an April 7, 2023 Complaint alleging claims
of (1) Medical Leave Retaliation, Govt. Code § 12945.2 (CFRA), (2) Paid Sick
Leave Retaliation, Labor Code § 245 et. seq. including 246.5, (3) Paid Sick
Leave Discrimination, Labor Code § 245 et seq. including 246.5, (4) Medical
Leave Discrimination, Govt. Code § 12945.2 (CFRA), (5) Retaliation for
Requesting Accommodations for Disabilities, Govt. Code § 12940(m), (6) Failure
to Engage in a Timely and Good Faith, Interactive Process to Determine
Reasonable Accommodation for Disability, Govt. Code § 12940(n), (7) Failure to
Reasonably Accommodate Disabilities, Govt. Code § 12940(m), (8) Disability
Discrimination, Govt. Code § 12940(a), (9) Discrimination Based on Ancestry –
Disparate Treatment, Govt. Code § 12940, (10) Discrimination Based on Age –
Disparate Treatment, Govt. Code § 12940, (11) Harassment Based on Ancestry,
Govt. Code § 12940, (12) Harassment Based on Age, Govt. Code § 12940, (13)
Retaliation for Opposing Violations of FEHA (Govt. Code § 12900, et seq.),
Govt. Code § 12940(h), (14) Failure to Prevent and Stop Harassment,
Discrimination, and Retaliation, Govt. Code § 12940(j), (k), (15) Whistleblower
Retaliation, Labor Code §§ 1102.5 & 1102.6, and (16) Unauthorized Wage
Deduction, California Labor Code 224 and 225.5.
The claims arise from allegations that in her employment with the “Child
Support Services” (CSS) division of the County of Los Angeles, Plaintiff’s
supervisor—Defendant Nancy Canosa—engaged in conduct that amounted to various
Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), California Family Rights Act (CFRA),
and Labor Code violations against Plaintiff. (Plaintiff also alleges to have
been terminated from her employment though the Court notes that such
termination is not given a date in the Complaint.) More specifically, Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant Canosa, as Plaintiff’s supervisor, failed to promptly
move Plaintiff from a work station that was exposed to an uncovered and
malfunctioning ventilation system on which mold had grown, commented that
Plaintiff was “showing” her “age” or that Plaintiff’s hair was graying, singled
Plaintiff out for criticism (e.g., work-from-home policy comment) or otherwise
ignored Plaintiff Rivero during team meetings, told Plaintiff she acted too
“Cuban” or “too loud,” failed to allow Plaintiff to telework despite health
conditions, thus forcing Plaintiff to get a doctor’s note, and otherwise
singled Plaintiff out for discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. Plaintiff
also alleges that another supervisor (Chough) once tried to discipline
Plaintiff for submitting a report against a safety engineer who failed to
accurately perform and report safety checks.
As to CSS itself, Plaintiff Rivero alleges she was otherwise harmed or
not well treated by this Defendant in other ways. Plaintiff alleges that she was
constantly being moved from department to department, that she was assigned
progressively less experienced supervisees to manage, and that CSS failed to
investigate reports of harassment and discrimination experienced by Plaintiff (Defendant
Canosa stating Plaintiff acted “too Cuban” or “loud” or being forced to return
to the workplace during the COVID-19 pandemic). Plaintiff further alleges that
Defendant Canosa’s failure to move Plaintiff from the moldy work environment
resulted in Plaintiff developing Diminished Lung Volume (DLV), that for months CSS
did not allow Plaintiff to return to work from medical leave with or without
restrictions pending further clarification as to Plaintiff’s ability to work/restrictions
from Plaintiff’s doctor, and that Plaintiff was finally allowed to return to
work, but without the restrictions that Plaintiff’s doctor had provided (no
supervision by Defendant Canosa and Mr. Chough). Plaintiff also alleges that CSS
and its agents held interactive process meetings without Plaintiff present, that
CSS agreed to conditions that it did not honor (third-party intermediary would
be present whenever Plaintiff and Defendant Canosa or Mr. Chough met and at
least one violation of that agreement), and that Plaintiff’s wages were withheld
in part as compensation to CSS for benefits paid for/used by Plaintiff during
an unpaid/no-benefits medical leave.
On June 12, 2023, Defendants demurred to the Complaint’s sixteen causes
of action based on sufficiency of pleading.
That same day, Defendants moved to strike portions of the Complaint
related to punitive damages.
Both motions were set for hearing on July 14, 2023.
On July 5, 2023, Defendants filed a reply noticing Plaintiff’s failure to
oppose the demurrer and motion to strike.
On July 12, 2023, the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike were
continued to October 9, 2023, at Plaintiff’s request.
On September 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed and served untimely oppositions to
the demurrer and motion to strike.
On October 4, 2023, Defendants filed and served untimely replies to the
oppositions.
Defendants’ demurrer and motion to strike are now before the Court.
 
Court’s
Motion to Strike
Legal Standard
The court may, upon a motion or at
any time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (a) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (b) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (Code Civ. Proc. §
436, subds. (a), (b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782
[“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage;
probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)
For the purposes of a motion to
strike pursuant to Sections 435 to 437 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the term
“pleading” generally means a demurrer, answer, complaint, or cross-complaint,
(Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (a)), and an immaterial allegation or irrelevant
matter in a pleading entails (1) an allegation that is not essential to the
statement of a claim or defense, (2) an allegation that is neither pertinent to
nor supported by an otherwise sufficient claim or defense, or (3) a demand for
judgment requesting relief not supported by the allegations of the complaint or
cross-complaint (Code Civ. Proc., § 431.10, subds. (b)(1)-(3), (c)).

Retaliation, Govt. Code § 12940(j), (k)]: RESERVED, SUBJECT TO ORAL
ARGUMENT.
Before filing an employment
discrimination lawsuit under FEHA, a plaintiff must exhaust her administrative
remedies before the Civil Rights Department (CRD) (formerly known as the Department
of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH)), e.g., filing a DFEH Complaint and
securing a Right-to-Sue Letter. (Gov. Code §§ 12960, subds. (b), (d), 12965,
subd. (b); see Rojo v. Kliger (1990) 52 Cal.3d 65, 88.) This requirement
is jurisdictional. (Miller v. United Airlines, Inc. (1985) 174
Cal.App.3d 878, 889-890.) To bring a lawsuit against a party under FEHA, the
defendants must have been named in the caption or body of the charge filed with
the CRD (i.e., DFEH Complaint). (See, e.g., Medix Ambulance Service, Inc.
v. Superior Court (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 109, 116-118.) 
In their demurrer, Defendants argue
that Plaintiff failed to exhaust her administrative remedies in relation to the
fifth to sixth, eighth to tenth, and thirteenth to fourteenth causes of action
because Plaintiff only filed a single claim for harassment with the CRD
[formerly DFEH]. Defendants also argue that because Plaintiff’s DFEH Complaint
was filed on May 11, 2022, all the alleged actionable conduct and injuries
alleged in the Complaint that follow this date are not covered by Plaintiff’s
administrative claim. (Demurrer, p. 8.)
In opposition, Plaintiff argues
that the new “counts find their foundation in the same set of facts as her
initial harassment claim, placing them squarely within the ‘reasonably related’
[and permissive] framework affirmed by California jurisprudence” in relation to
the scope of a DFEH Complaint, which “allows new but intrinsically connected
allegations to be incorporated into a lawsuit.” Plaintiff also argues that “California
and federal case law actually permit the inclusion of such subsequent
incidents, especially if they are closely related to the original complaint.”
(Opp’n, pp. 3-4.)
The reply does not discuss
exhaustion of administrative remedies. (See Reply.)
The Court finds it is uncertain as
to the DFEH claim at issue and, as a result, the FEHA claims. 
The Complaint’s allegations are
uncertain as to the timeline for the DFEH Complaint and the underlying support
for Plaintiff’s FEHA claims. The body of the Complaint alleges that the DFEH
Complaint was filed on May 11, 2022. (Complaint, ¶ 55.) Yet, the DFEH Complaint
and Right to Sue Letter attached to the Complaint show that the DFEH Complaint
was filed on March 31, 2023 and contains facts allegedly occurring after May
11, 2022. (Complaint, Ex. 1, DFEH Complaint, pp. 1-3 [providing Date Filed date
of Mar. 31, 2023].) No other right to sue letter is attached to the Complaint,
demurrer, motion to strike, oppositions, or replies. As far as the March 31,
2023 DFEH Complaint attached to Exhibit 1 conflicts with the May 11, 2022
allegations in the Complaint’s body, the attached DFEH Complaint and its March
31, 2023 date take precedence. (Holland v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc., supra,
86 Cal.App.4th at p. 1447.) Yet, the parties’ papers make arguments relating to
the DFEH Complaint based on the May 11, 2022 date, and the Opposition does not mention
the March 31, 2023 DFEH Complaint which is attached to the Complaint.
Under such circumstances, it is
uncertain what Defendants’ argument is premised on, and whether there is a
problem with Plaintiffs’ exhaustion of administrative remedies with the CRD. The
Court cannot determine whether the March 31, 2023 DFEH Complaint is an
amendment to the alleged May 11, 2022 DFEH Complaint or if the March 31, 2023
DFEH Complaint is the Complaint that supports all of Plaintiff’s FEHA claims.
(The latter conclusion is doubtful given that the May 11, 2022 DFEH Complaint
allegedly limited itself to a harassment claim and did not include Defendant
Canosa, but the March 31, 2023 DFEH Complaint includes harassment,
discrimination, and retaliation claims, and includes Defendant Canosa as a
respondent.)
Defendants’ demurrer, however, is
not premised on these grounds.
Therefore, the Court requests
additional information about this issue at the time of oral argument.
 
Defendants’
Demurrer
Timeliness of Opposition
Even when a party does expressly
object to inadequate notice but then opposes a motion (or replies to an
opposition) on the merits, the issue of defective notice may be waived unless
the opposing party makes a request for a continuance or demonstrates prejudice
from the defective notice. (See Carlton v. Quint (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th
690, 697; Reedy v. Bussell (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1272, 1288; accord. Robinson
v. Woods (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1264 [When a party only “respond[s]
to [a] [late-served] motion by filing a written opposition containing only the
notice objections and never argue[s] the merits,” no waiver occurs, such that
the objecting party need “not … [even] claim or show prejudice [to object to
the late-served motion] because the[] [plaintiffs] did not address the merits
[of the motion], in writing or otherwise”]; contra. Boyle v. CertainTeed
Corp. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 645, 650 [“A party’s participation in a
hearing after the party’s objection to the hearing as unauthorized does not
constitute waiver by acquiescence”].)
Here, the opposition was filed on
September 29, 2023 but should have been filed on September 26, 2023, three
court days earlier. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) However, Defendants
replied on the merits, provide no request for a continuance, and do not argue
that the lateness of the opposition has prejudiced them (other than perhaps being
limited to a shortened amount of time to reply to the opposition). (See Demurrer
Reply.) Accordingly, any defective (late) service of the opposition is deemed
waived. The Court does not find any prejudice, particularly given that the
Court will consider their late-filed reply (see below).
The Court briefly notes that the
reply was filed on October 2, 2023, two court days late. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1005, subd. (b).) However, the Court nevertheless considers the reply because
it was made likely late as a result of the late-filed opposition. 
Demurrer Sufficiency Standard
A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) This
device can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a
[general] demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High
School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) In testing the sufficiency of the
cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly
pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962,
966-67.) A demurrer, however, “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d
695, 713.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally
and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other grounds, Jones v.
Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) The face
of the complaint includes exhibits attached to the complaint. (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.) If facts appearing in the exhibits
contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits take precedence. (Holland
v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, superseded
by statute on other grounds as stated in White v. Cridlebaugh (2009) 178
Cal.App.4th 506, 521.)
I.
Complaint, Fifth through Fourteenth
Causes of Action: RESERVED.
The Court cannot reach the
demurrer’s arguments in relation to the FEHA claims—i.e., failure to exhaust
administrative remedies, failure to include Defendant Canosa in the May 11,
2022 DFEH Complaint, and failure to sufficiently allege each of the ten FEHA
claims—until it can reach a determination of the issue of exhaustion noted
above. As noted above, it would appear that the parties are citing to a DFEH
Complaint that was not attached to the Complaint.
II.
Complaint, Fifteenth Cause of
Action [(15) Whistleblower Retaliation and Labor Code §§ 1102.5 & 1102.6]:
SUSTAINED, With Leave to Amend.
In pursuing a Labor Code section
1102.5 whistleblower retaliation claim, a plaintiff has the burden to show “by
a preponderance of the evidence” that the employee’s protected whistleblowing
was a “contributing factor” to an adverse employment action, and if the
plaintiff succeeds in making this showing, the employer must in turn
demonstrate by “clear and convincing evidence” that the alleged adverse
employment action would have occurred “for legitimate, independent reasons”
even if the employee had not engaged in protected whistleblowing activities. (Lawson
v. PPG Architectural Finishes, Inc. 12 Cal.5th 703, 712 [citing to Labor
Code section 1102.6 and disapproving McDonnell Douglas framework to
whistleblower claims as held in Patten v. Grant Joint Union High School
Dist. (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1384.)
In their demurrer, Defendants argue
that Plaintiff fails to sufficiently allege a whistleblower retaliation claim
because she “fails to allege causation, or even an adverse employment action.” This
argument is not further elaborated. (Demurrer, pp. 11-12.)
In opposition, Plaintiff argues
that paragraphs 45 to 51 in the Complaint sufficiently support causation and
that paragraphs 52 to 54 in the Complaint sufficiently allege the adverse
employment actions. (Opp’n, p. 6.)
Defendants’ reply is limited to
FEHA and other Labor Code arguments. It does not make arguments related to the whistleblower
retaliation claim. (See Reply, pp. 2-8.)
The Court finds in favor of
Defendants.
The Court fails to locate any
whistleblowing allegations in paragraphs 45 to 54. These paragraphs are instead
devoted to describing (1) the process by which Plaintiff obtained a letter from
her primary care physician that placed her off work between September 27, 2021
and March 28, 2022, (2) the result of Plaintiff’s subsequent medical
evaluations, (3) Plaintiff’s notes and attempts to return back to work, (4)
Defendants’ refusal to allow Plaintiff to return to work, (5) interactive
process meetings in which Plaintiff did not participate, and (6) a worker’s
compensation claim. (Complaint, ¶¶ 45-54.) Without a whistleblowing activity,
there can be no adverse employment action or causation for section 1102.5 or
1102.6 purposes.
Defendants’ demurrer to the
Complaint’s fifteenth cause of action is thus SUSTAINED, With Leave to Amend.
III.
Complaint, First and Fourth
Causes of Action [(1) Medical Leave Retaliation, Govt. Code § 12945.2 (CFRA)
and (4) Medical Leave Discrimination, Govt. Code § 12945.2 (CFRA)]: SUSTAINED,
With Leave to Amend.
The CFRA makes it unlawful for an
employer to refuse to hire, discharge, fine, suspend, expel, or discriminate
against any individual based on (1) that individual’s exercise of the right to
family care and medical leave provided by subdivision (a) of section 12945.2 of
the Government Code or (2) that individual giving information or testimony as
to the individual’s own family care and medical leave, or another person’s
family care and medical leave, in any inquiry or proceeding related to rights
guaranteed under the CFRA. (Govt. Code, § 12945.2, subd. (k).)
“The elements of a cause of action
for retaliation in violation of [California Family Rights Act] are “‘(1) the
defendant was an employer covered by CFRA; (2) the plaintiff was an employee
eligible to take CFRA [leave]; (3) the plaintiff exercised her right to take
leave for a qualifying CFRA purpose; and (4) the plaintiff suffered an adverse
employment action, such as termination, fine, or suspension, because of her
exercise of her right to CFRA [leave].”’” (Soria v. Univision Radio Los
Angeles, Inc. (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 570, 604, citations omitted; see also
Govt. Code, § 12945.2, subd. (k).)
In their demurrer, Defendants argue
that “[Plaintiff] Rivero[’s] [Complaint] alleges no facts supporting” CFRA
“interference or retaliation,” particularly where the Complaint alleges that
Plaintiff took more than the “twelve … weeks’ leave allowable under the CFRA.”
(Demurrer, p. 13.)
In opposition, Plaintiff
essentially argues that there is no authority banning CFRA claims for leave
past 12 weeks, that any alleged adverse action following twelve weeks of leave clearly
shows retaliation, and that the alleged interference is based on Defendants
forcing Rivero to exceed her CFRA allotment based on their lack of reasonable
accommodations and other unspecified issues. (Opp’n, p. 8.)
In reply, Defendants make arguments
beyond the scope of the demurrer, which are not accepted. (Reply, pp. 4-6; Nordstrom Com. Cases
(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 576, 583 [Courts generally need not accept arguments
raised for the first time on reply without good cause explanation as to why
points were not raised earlier].)
The Court finds in favor of Defendants.
It is not clear to the Court, based
on Plaintiff’s opposition arguments, how the Complaint pleads that the
Defendants retaliated against Plaintiff based on Plaintiff taking medical leave.
Plaintiff’s opposition does not point to paragraphs in the Complaint showing
such allegations were made. A review of the first and fourth causes of action shows
they merely cite the elements of those claims and rely on incorporated
allegations for support. (Complaint, ¶¶ 76-79, 88-91; see Complaint, ¶¶ 12-71
[underlying allegations].) A review of the incorporated allegations fails to
show such retaliation or even discrimination generally, let alone retaliation
or discrimination based on medical leave. Plaintiff is alleged to have been on
medical leave from approximately September 27, 2021 to March 28, 2022 and to
have attempted to return to work on March 29, 2022. (Complaint, ¶¶ 45-50.)
Thereafter, the County of Los Angeles demanded that Plaintiff’s doctor provide
an updated note, forcing Plaintiff to remain on leave until January 30, 2023,
i.e., ten days after Plaintiff allegedly received a return-to-work letter
confirming that Plaintiff’s doctor had allowed her to return to work with no
accommodations. (Complaint, ¶¶ 51-66.) The allegations that follow relate to
other matters or payments withheld from Plaintiff’s check based on outstanding
balances. (Complaint, ¶¶ 67-71.) In this chain of allegations, it is not clear
to the Court what retaliation or discrimination Defendants committed against
Plaintiff, nor how any such retaliation or discrimination was based on
Plaintiff’s request for medical leave.
Defendants’ demurrer to the
Complaint’s first and fourth causes of action is thus SUSTAINED, With Leave to
Amend.
IV.
Complaint, Second, Third, and
Sixteenth Causes of Action [(2) Paid Sick Leave Retaliation, Labor Code § 245
et. seq. including 246.5, (3) Paid Sick Leave Discrimination, Labor Code § 245
et seq. including 246.5, and (16) Unauthorized Wage Deduction, California Labor
Code 224 and 225.5]: SUSTAINED, With Leave to Amend.
In their demurrer, Defendants argue
that the second, third, and sixteenth causes of action fail because (1) “Rivero
has failed to set forth any facts demonstrating any form of retaliation and
discrimination,” (2) Rivero “has … failed to set forth facts showing that wage
deductions were “unauthorized,” (3) the “Labor Code sections pertaining to wage
and deduction claims are inapplicable against the County as a public entity”
based on the County’s Home Rule doctrine, (4) the “the County’s procurement of
overpayments through wage deductions is not unlawful,” and (5) “Rivero fails to
allege meeting the claims presentation requirements under Government Code
Section 911.2.” (Demurrer, pp. 13-14.)
In opposition, Plaintiff argues
that Labor Code statutes can indeed apply to the public sector under certain
conditions and thereafter cites three cases with parentheticals. However, Plaintiff
does not respond to all of the arguments made by Defendants, and her citations
do not clearly apply to the allegations made in her Complaint. (Opp’n, p. 8.)
In reply, Defendants reiterate
their demurrer arguments and distinguish one of the authorities cited by
Plaintiff Rivero. (Reply, p. 8.)
The Court finds in favor of
Defendants.
The Court first adopts its above
discussion in Section III to determine that the Complaint does not clearly
plead retaliation and discrimination against Plaintiff Rivero based on her
request for or use of sick leave.
The Court next notes that the
Complaint alleges that Plaintiff’s wages were deducted to compensate the County
for costs it paid to provide Plaintiff medical benefits during what should have
been an unpaid medical leave. (Complaint, ¶¶ 67-71.) To the extent that that
Complaint alleges that the deductions were nevertheless prohibited or should
not have been made, such allegations are conclusory because the Complaint does
not allege ultimate facts supporting this conclusion.
Defendants’ demurrer to the
Complaint’s second, third, and sixteenth causes of action is thus SUSTAINED,
With Leave to Amend.
 
Defendants’ Motion to Strike
Timeliness
of Opposition and Reply
The
Court accepts both the opposition and reply based on the Timeliness discussion
in the Demurrer section above.
Legal
Standard
See
above.
Order
Striking Punitive Damages Allegations and Prayer from Complaint: RESERVED.
Because
the Court has sustained Defendants’ demurrer to some of the Complaint’s claims,
and because it has questions regarding the exhaustion of administrative
remedies as to the other claims, punitive damages allegations and prayers may be
irrelevant in this action. The Court will entertain further argument regarding Defendants’
motion to strike such allegations and prayer at oral argument. 

Conclusion
The Court requests argument regarding
the fifth through fourteenth causes of action brought under FEHA, for the
reasons discussed above.
Defendants County of Los Angeles
and Nancy Canosa’s Demurrer to Complaint is RESERVED, in Part, and SUSTAINED,
With Leave to Amend, in Part, as follows:
(1) RESERVED as to the Complaint’s
fifth through fourteenth causes of action; and
(2) SUSTAINED, With Leave to Amend,
as to the Complaint’s first through fourth and fifteenth to sixteenth causes of
action.
Defendants County of Los Angeles
