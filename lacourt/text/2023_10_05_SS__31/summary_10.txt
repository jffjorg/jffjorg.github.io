Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court's tentative ruling grants the Defendant's unopposed motion to compel discovery responses from the Plaintiff. The Defendant propounded form interrogatories on October 21, 2022, and the Plaintiff failed to serve responses despite multiple extensions granted by the Defendant. The Court finds that the Plaintiff was properly served and failed to respond, therefore waiving any objections to the discovery requests. The Court orders the Plaintiff to serve verified responses to the Defendant's form interrogatories without objections within 15 days.

The Court also denies the Defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,310.00 because the Notice of Motion did not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040. The Defendant is ordered to give notice of the denial.

The Court encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement before the hearing, and reminds them to submit by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
