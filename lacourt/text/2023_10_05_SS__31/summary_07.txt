And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on a motion filed by counsel, Helen Won, to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiffs, Tameca Shavon Thomas and Donald Ray Thomas. The motion is based on the fact that counsel and plaintiffs are unable to agree on how to proceed with the case, and the plaintiffs will no longer accept counsel's advice. The judge has conditionally granted the motion if all parties present before the court and stipulate to a trial continuance. The judge has also ordered counsel to give notice to the parties. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit to the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with specific details. If the parties do not submit or appear at the hearing, the court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court.
