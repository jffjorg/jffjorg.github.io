And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint. The plaintiff filed the complaint on February 25, 2021, and it was dismissed on August 25, 2022, after no one appeared at the non-jury trial. The plaintiff filed the motion to set aside the dismissal on November 28, 2022, claiming that the dismissal was due to excusable neglect by the plaintiff's counsel. The judge finds that the counsel's failure to appear was caused by a calendaring issue and that the plaintiff timely filed the motion. Therefore, the motion is granted, and the action is reinstated. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice, and the parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement.
