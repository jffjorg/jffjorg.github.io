Here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion for leave to file a cross-complaint filed by Uber Technologies, Inc., Rasier, LLC, and Rasier-CA, LLC (collectively, "Uber Defendants") against Defendant Francisco J. Giron. The cross-complaint seeks to impose comparative indemnity and apportionment of fault, equitable indemnity, contribution, and declaratory relief on Giron. The Uber Defendants argue that the complaint and cross-complaint arise from the same incident and should be litigated together. Since no opposition was filed, the Court finds that leave to file the proposed cross-complaint would be in the interest of justice with no identifiable prejudice. The motion is granted, and the Uber Defendants are ordered to file their proposed cross-complaint within ten days of the date of this Order.
