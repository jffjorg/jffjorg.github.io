And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the request for default judgment submitted by Benetta Myles against Falkenn Logistics, Gustavo Alonso Valdev Mejia, and Global Logistics Solutions Group, LLC (Doe 1). The Court is unable to locate the proposed judgment on form JUD-100, which is mandatory. Additionally, the Plaintiff must submit a copy of the Statement of Damages served on each Defendant and demonstrate that the Statement of Damages were served on each Defendant prior to obtaining their defaults. The Plaintiff has not dismissed all the unnamed Doe defendants, and the Plaintiff's declaration is not signed under penalty of perjury with admissible evidence in support of the amount of damages sought. The Plaintiff also failed to authenticate the medical records attached to the declaration, which do not support the principal damage of $895,000. The Plaintiff is required to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects by a certain date, and failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal.
