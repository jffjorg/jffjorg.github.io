And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for terminating sanctions brought by defendants Petrolion, Inc., BP Products North America Inc., and Tesoro Refining & Marketing Company LLC against plaintiff Gerardo Rodriguez-Huerta. The defendants argue that the plaintiff has misused the discovery process by failing to serve responses to written discovery and failing to comply with court orders. The plaintiff has failed to respond to the defendants' deposition notice and has not appeared for his deposition. The court finds that the plaintiff has willfully disobeyed the court's orders and has failed to demonstrate that his non-compliance was not willful. Given the plaintiff's prior failures to comply with discovery obligations and his apparent lack of interest in prosecuting the action, the court concludes that lesser sanctions would not curb the abuse. Therefore, the court grants the defendants' motion for terminating sanctions and dismisses the plaintiff's action against the defendants with prejudice.
