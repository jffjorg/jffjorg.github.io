And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's request for default judgment against defendants Noreen Almas and Bibi Fuel, Inc. in the amount of $26,590 (special and general damages) and $555 in costs, for a total of $27,145. The court found that the plaintiff submitted sufficient medical bills and medical records to support her claim for past medical treatment costs and pain and suffering. However, the court reduced the plaintiff's request for special damages from $17,565 to $6,590 due to the lack of supporting evidence for her claim for lost wages and future earning capacity. The court also noted that courts may not award speculative damages, and therefore did not award the plaintiff's claim for lost future earning capacity. The court ordered the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
