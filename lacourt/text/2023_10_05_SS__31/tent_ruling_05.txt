 Case Number:  20STCV48945    Hearing Date:   October 5, 2023    Dept:  31 DEPT:   31 OSC DATE:  10/05/2023 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  20STCV48945 CRYSTAL HOVEY vs NOREEN ALMAS, et al. REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  NOREEN ALMAS; and  BIBI FUEL, INC. RECOMMENDATION:  GRANT in the following amounts: Principal damages: $26,590.00 Costs: $555 TOTAL: $27,145.00   TENTATIVE  Plaintiff seeks $17,565 in special damages, $20,000 in general damages, and $555 in costs for a total of $38,120 against Defendants Noreen Almas and Bibi Fuel, Inc.  The request for default judgment submitted on August 9, 2023 is GRANTED in for the following reasons:  Plaintiff submits sufficient medical bills in support of Plaintiff’s past medical treatment costs, and medical records from 2018 to 2022 in support of her claim for pain and suffering. Plaintiff also seeks costs in the amount of $555 for clerk filing fees and process server’s fees, which are allowable under CCP §1033.5.   However, there are no records substantiating Plaintiff’s claim for lost wages in the amount of $975, such as records demonstrating Plaintiff worked at the Salvation Army, and records evidencing Plaintiff’s earnings and missed time at work. Furthermore, there is no evidence of loss of future earning capacity in the amount of $10,000. Plaintiff does not provide any evidence or calculation of the reasonable value of her lost earning capacity.   Courts may not award speculative damages, which means compensation for future loss or harm which, although possible, is conjectural or not reasonably certain.
