And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies Plaintiff's motions to compel Defendant to provide further responses to discovery requests. The judge finds that Plaintiff failed to adequately meet and confer with Defendant's counsel before bringing the motion. The judge also finds that Defendant's opposition was substantially justified by Plaintiff's failure to meet and confer. As a result, the judge does not award sanctions against Defendant and its counsel. The judge notes that the dispute over whether Plaintiff adequately met and conferred is a key issue in the case, and that Defendant's repeated offers to supplement its responses were made in good faith.
