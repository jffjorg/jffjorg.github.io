 Hearing Date:  April 25, 2024
 Calendar Number:  7



 
 
 
Defendant Wilshire Commercial Capital, L.L.C. d/b/a Wilshire
Consumer Credit (“Defendant”), which states that it was erroneously sued as
Wilshire Consumer Credit of Los Angeles, demurs to the Complaint filed by
Plaintiff Fallon Seaborn (“Plaintiff”).
 
The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.  Plaintiff shall amend the Complaint within 20
days.
 
Background
 
            This
is a breach of contract case. Defendant is a lender that makes small, secured
cash loans. Plaintiff alleges that Plaintiff and Defendant entered into an
agreement on June 5, 2019.
 
            Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant makes loans at a very high interest rate. Plaintiff
alleges that an entity referred to as CashCall also makes very high-interest
loans and makes untrue or misleading statements about the rates it charges.
 
            Plaintiff
filed this action on July 19, 2021, raising claims for (1) breach of contract;
and (2) intentional tort.
 
            Defendant
demurred to the Complaint on March 30, 2024. Plaintiff did not file an
opposition.
 
Legal Standard
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading
alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants,
Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) The court assumes the truth
of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.) The only issue a demurrer is
concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of
action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be
allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335,
348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Ibid.;
Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f
there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause
of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).
 
Discussion
 
Breach of Contract
 
To state a cause of action for
breach of contract, Plaintiff must be able to establish “(1) the existence of
the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011)
51 Cal.4th 811, 821.)

 
If a breach of contract claim “is based on alleged breach of
a written contract, the terms must be set out verbatim in the body of the
complaint or a copy of the written agreement must be attached and incorporated
by reference.” (Harris v. Rudin, Richman
& Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 307.) In some circumstances, a
plaintiff may also “plead the legal effect of the contract rather than its
precise language.” (Construction
Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189,
198-199.)
 
Although Plaintiff indicates that the contract in question
is attached as Exhibit A to the Complaint, the Complaint does not include an
Exhibit A. Plaintiff has therefore failed to attach the contract or set forth
its terms verbatim.
 
Additionally, Plaintiff has not pled their performance (or
excuse for nonperformance) or explained how Defendant breached the contract.
 
The Court sustains the demurrer with leave to amend.
 
Intentional Tort
 
Plaintiff does not clearly state what tort is alleged.
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant was intentionally giving high interest rates.
Plaintiff alleges that CashCall typically issues loans with interest rates of
84.81%. Plaintiff does not allege what the relationship between CashCall and
Defendant is. It is therefore unclear what wrongful conduct Plaintiff is
alleging that Defendant did, and the Court must sustain the demurrer.
 
It does not appear certain that amendment would be futile.
Plaintiff may be attempting to state a claim for usury. 
 
“The essential elements of usury are: (1) The transaction
must be a loan or forbearance; (2) the interest to be paid must exceed the
statutory maximum; (3) the loan and interest must be absolutely repayable by
the borrower; and (4) the lender must have a willful intent … to take the
amount of interest which he receives[.]” (Ghirardo v. Antonioli (1994) 8
Cal.4th 791, 798.) “A transaction is rebuttably presumed not to
be usurious.” (Ibid. [emphasis in original].)
 
Plaintiff may be able to allege usury on the part of
Defendant, but more substantive allegations are required. The Court sustains
the demurrer with leave to amend.
