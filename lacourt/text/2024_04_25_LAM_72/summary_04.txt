And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion by Tracfone Wireless, Inc. (Defendant) to set aside a default entered against it on March 27, 2024. The default was entered after Defendant failed to respond to the First Amended Complaint filed by Jaston Archie (Plaintiff) on February 21, 2024. Defendant retained Yu Mohandesi LLP to handle the case, but counsel for Defendant made a mistake, causing the deadline to respond to the complaint to be missed. The court granted Defendant's motion to set aside default, allowing Defendant to respond to the complaint within 10 days. The court found that Defendant's mistake was excusable, and that setting aside the default was proper under California Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b).
