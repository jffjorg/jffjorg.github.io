Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is regarding the case between Fallon Seaborn (Plaintiff) and Wilshire Commercial Capital, L.L.C. d/b/a Wilshire Consumer Credit (Defendant). The Plaintiff has alleged breach of contract and intentional tort. The Defendant has demurred to the complaint.

The court sustains the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning the Plaintiff has 20 days to amend their complaint. The court finds that the Plaintiff has failed to attach the contract or set forth its terms verbatim, and has not pleaded their performance or excuse for non-performance. Additionally, the Plaintiff has not clearly stated what tort is alleged.

The court is giving the Plaintiff an opportunity to amend the complaint, as there is a reasonable possibility that the Plaintiff can state a good cause of action. The court is giving the Plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint and will then reconsider the demurrer.
