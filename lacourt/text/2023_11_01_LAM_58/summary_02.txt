And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court sustains the demurrer in its entirety with leave to amend. The first amended complaint fails to state a claim for breach of joint venture, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, and fraudulent conveyance. The Court finds that the first amended complaint lacks sufficient details about the obligations of each party, the date of the agreement, and the management control of the joint venture. Additionally, the Court finds that the first amended complaint fails to specify the partnership rights and what is involved in the management control.

Plaintiffs shall have leave to amend and shall file and serve an amended complaint by December 1, 2023.
