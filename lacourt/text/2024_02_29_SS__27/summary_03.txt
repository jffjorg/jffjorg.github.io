And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge will hear a petition to approve a compromise of a pending action involving a minor, Brodie Stephenson, aged 11. The court will excuse the personal appearance of the minor and the guardian ad litem, and will instead hear from the minor's counsel. The court has reviewed the petition and notes that the proposed distribution of $35,000 to a guardianship of the estate and $25,000 to a blocked account is unclear, as there is no case number listed under Section 18(a). The court also questions the necessity of distributing funds to a blocked account, which would require the minor or the petitioner to return to court in the future to unblock the funds as needed or at age 18. Despite these concerns, the court has approved the actual settlement amount of $60,000. The court will hear further arguments from the minor's counsel regarding the proposed distributions.
