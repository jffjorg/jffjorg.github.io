And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Lyft, Inc. against the fourth and fifth causes of action in the lawsuit filed by Kyle Testa against Lyft, Inc. The lawsuit claims that Lyft is liable for the assault and battery suffered by Testa at the hands of a Lyft driver, Robert Doe. The demurrer argues that the complaint fails to provide sufficient facts to support the causes of action.

The Judge has granted the demurrer to the fifth cause of action, which alleges negligent hiring, supervision, and retention by Lyft, and has given leave to amend. The Judge has also granted the demurrer to the fourth cause of action, which alleges general negligence by Lyft, and has given leave to amend.

The Judge has found that the complaint does not adequately plead the causes of action, particularly with regard to the fifth cause of action, which requires more specific allegations regarding Robert Doe. The Judge has also found that the complaint does not adequately plead the fourth cause of action, which requires more detailed allegations regarding Lyft's knowledge or should-have-known about the risk posed by Robert Doe.

The Judge has given the parties an opportunity to submit on the tentative ruling by email, and has indicated that if the parties do not submit or appear at the hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.
