Background
 
This is
a slip and fall case where Plaintiff alleges that she fell on a sidewalk due to
the City of Los Angeles' failure to rectify hazardous conditions. Plaintiff
served a second Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) notice upon Defendant on
December 28, 2023, for a deposition initially scheduled for January 17, 2024. From
January 10, 2024, to January 17, 2024, Plaintiff sent Defendant several meet
and confer letters regarding the deposition. Defendant did not provide a
response. On January 26, 2024, Plaintiff again requested a deposition date, to
which Defendant responded that it would look into it. On February 5, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the current motion to compel the PMK deposition.
 
Legal
Standard  
 
Any party may obtain discovery,
subject to restrictions, by taking the oral deposition of any person,
including any party to the action.¿¿(Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.010.)¿A properly served deposition notice is effective to
require a party or party-affiliated deponent to attend and to testify, as well
as to produce documents for inspection and copying.¿¿(Code
Civ. Proc., §
2025.280, subd. (a).)¿¿ 
 
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action . . . or employee
of a party . . . , without having served a valid objection under Section
2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce
for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move
for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
2025.450, subd. (a).)  
 
“The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the
documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the
deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted
the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (b)(2).)   
 
Analysis

Plaintiff's
motion to compel is deemed premature. Defendant produced emails evidencing that
the parties were engaging in meet and confer discussions as of January 27,
2024, wherein Defendant agreed to look into potential PMK deposition dates. (Exhibit
1 to Ticas Decl.) Subsequently, in early February, Defendant proposed several
dates in early April for the PMK deposition. (Id.) Until recently, the
parties were still in the process of figuring out a schedule for their
respective depositions. (Id.)
Accordingly, the court will continue the motion to May 6,
2024, and the parties are ORDERED to further meet and confer to finalize on a
deposition schedule before May 6, 2024.
Regarding sanctions, the court found no misuse of the
discovery process by Defendant as it was engaged in the meet and confer process
before and after the motion's filing, along with proposing several dates for
the PMK deposition. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion for sanctions is DENIED.
