And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint, which alleges general negligence. The judge finds that the complaint does not sufficiently plead a cause of action for general negligence, as it fails to reference the defendant, Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., beyond establishing its corporate identity and business operations. The judge concludes that the plaintiff has a reasonable possibility of making a sufficient showing to sufficiently allege a cause of action for general negligence, and therefore grants leave to amend the complaint. The plaintiff must plead four elements for a general negligence claim: a legal duty owed to the plaintiff to use due care, breach of duty, causation, and damage to the plaintiff. The judge also notes that the parties have fulfilled the meet and confer requirement and that the plaintiff has not opposed the motion on this basis.
