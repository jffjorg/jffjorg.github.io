And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to the interrogatories. The plaintiff failed to respond to the interrogatories served on October 11, 2022, and despite being granted an extension until December 16, 2022, the plaintiff still failed to respond. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to provide responses to the interrogatories without objections within 10 days of February 26, 2024. The lack of response also constitutes a waiver of any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.230. The judge has also implied that the plaintiff may be subject to sanctions for misuse of the discovery process.
