Background
 
Plaintiff Ara Carapet Manukian filed a
lawsuit against Defendant Trader Joe’s following an incident on August 6, 2020,
where he alleges he tripped over an ergonomic mat in a Trader Joe’s store.
Through its investigation, Defendant discovered undisclosed medical providers
whot Plaintiff had consulted, including Dr. Farhad Nasr Chimeh. On August 30,
2023, Defendant subpoenaed Dr. Farhad Nasr Chimeh for Plaintiff’s medical and
billing records. Dr. Chimeh did not respond to the subpoena or Defendant's
attempts to meet and confer. Consequently, Defendant filed a motion on December
7, 2023, to compel Dr. Chimeh to comply with the subpoena for documents. The
motion is unopposed.
 
Legal Standard and
Analysis
 
CCP § 2020.010 permits discovery of non-party witnesses
through oral and written depositions. (See CCP § 2020.010(a)(1), (2); Hawkins
v. TACA International Airlines, S.A. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 466, 476.) A
deposition subpoena may command the attendance and testimony of the deponent,
the production of business records, or both. (CCP § 2020.020.) Additional
requirements regarding notification and a right to object are in place where
the records sought are consumer records, including personal medical records.
(See CCP § 1985.3.)  
 
Two provisions in the Code of Civil Procedure govern
motions to compel responses to deposition subpoenas. CCP § 1987.1 provides that
“[i]f a subpoena requires the attendance of a witness or the production of
books, documents, electronically stored information, or other things before a
court, or at the trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of a deposition,
the court, upon motion reasonably made by [a party or a witness] . . . may make
an order quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance
with it upon those terms or conditions as the court shall declare, including
protective orders.”  
 
CCP § 2025.480(a) similarly provides that “[i]f a deponent fails to answer any question or to
produce any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing under the deponent's control that is
specified in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena, the party seeking
discovery may move the court for an order compelling that answer or
production.” Unlike CCP § 1987.1, CCP § 2025.480 also includes a time
limit. If a nonparty disobeys a deposition
subpoena, the subpoenaing party may seek a court order compelling the nonparty
to comply with the subpoena within 60 days after
completion of the deposition record. (CCP §
2025.480(b); Unzipped Apparel, LLC v. Bader (2007) 156 CA4th 123, 127.) The
deposition record is “complete” either on the date documents are specified for
production or on the date objections are served. (Board of Registered
Nursing v. Sup.Ct. (Johnson & Johnson) (2021) 59 CA5th 1011, 1032-1033.)
 
Here, no objections were served. (Mathis
Decl. ¶ 7.) Thus, the deposition record is deemed complete on the date the documents
were specified for production, September 27, 2023. (Mathis Decl. ¶ 6 and
Exhibit 3 to Mathis Decl.) Defendant filed the current motion on December 7,
2023, surpassing the 60-day deadline, rendering the motion untimely.
 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.
