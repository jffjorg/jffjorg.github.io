The Court excuses the personal appearance of Claimant and
the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference
call.   
  
The Court has reviewed the Petition to Approve Compromise
of Pending Action of Brodie Stephenson, a minor, aged 11. The Court will hear
from Claimant’s counsel regarding the following: 
 
1.      Petitioner
proposes to distribute $35k to a guardianship of the estate for the minor
plaintiff (Section 18(a)(1)) and to distribute the remaining $25k to a blocked
account (Section 18(a)(2)). It is not clear that there is guardianship of the
estate for the minor plaintiff.  No case number is listed under Section
18(a). If there is a guardianship of the minor’s estate, then Attachment 18(a)1
and 18(a)2 must to be filled out.

The necessity
     of distribution to a blocked account that will require that petitioner or
     minor to return to this civil department over time with petition(s) to
     unblock the funds as needed or at age 18.  

The actual settlement amount leading to $60,000 for the
Minor is approved.
