English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies Defendant Jessica Park's motion to reclassify the action from unlimited to limited due to the possibility that Plaintiff Ramon Vasquez's damages could exceed the statutory limit of $25,000. The motion was filed after the initial pleading and requires the court to determine whether the case should be reclassified. The court found that the case cannot be reclassified because there is a possibility that the damages will exceed $25,000, as Plaintiff Ramon Vasquez has incurred approximately $12,000 in medical expenses and may pursue general damages for pain and suffering.
