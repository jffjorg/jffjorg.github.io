The judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition to approve the compromise of pending actions of minors Alex Nikolai and Aaron Alchian. The petition was denied due to several deficiencies, including the failure to provide a breakdown of the cost, incomplete information about the apportionment of settlement payments, and incorrect information on the claim form. The judge has ordered the claimants to correct these deficiencies and has set an OSC (Order to Show Cause) for March 29, 2024. The parties are encouraged to submit their comments on the tentative ruling by email and may choose to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
