And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion filed by defendants Los Angeles Unified School District and Harold Boger to compel the deposition of defendant Simone Young. The deposition was noticed on September 13, 2023, and was set to take place on October 3, 2023. Simone Young appeared for her deposition, but left when she realized it would be video recorded, despite the notice indicating that the deposition would be videotaped. The defendants have shown entitlement to an order compelling Young's videotaped deposition, and Young has not opposed the motion. The motion is therefore granted.
