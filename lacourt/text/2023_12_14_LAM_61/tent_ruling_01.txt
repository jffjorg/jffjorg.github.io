Los Angeles Unified School District and Harold Boger’s Motion to Compel
Deposition of Defendant Simone Young is GRANTED.
 
I.       MOTION TO COMPEL DEPOSITION
A party may make a
motion compelling a witness’s deposition “after service of a deposition notice”
if that witness “fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2025.450, subd. (a).) The motion must include a meet-and-confer
declaration and show good cause for the discovery sought. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2025.450, subd. (b)(1), (2).)
 
Defendants LAUSD and Harold Boger move to compel the
deposition of Defendant Simone Young (Young). Young’s deposition was noticed on
September 13, 2023, to take place on September 22, 2023, then amended the
notice to set the deposition for October 3, 2023. (Cho Decl. ¶¶ 3–4, Exh. A.)
Young appeared for her deposition on October 3, 2023, but left when she
realized the deposition was going to be video recorded. (Cho Decl. ¶ 6; Exh.
B.) The notice had indicated that the deposition would be videotaped. (Cho Decl.
Exh. A.) 
 
Defendants have shown entitlement to an order compelling
Young’s videotaped deposition, in compliance with the notice served upon her.
Young has not opposed the motion.
 
The motion is GRANTED.
