BACKGROUND
The instant petition arises from allegations for
personal injuries that occurred on August 17, 2022 and October 6, 2022 wherein
Petitioner, a minor (11 at the time of the alleged incident and currently 12 at
the time of filing this petition), alleges that as a result of GUSD’s
negligence in failing to provide adequate supervision and security to
petitioner, petitioner was bullied, assaulted, battered, and harmed.
ANALYSIS
Government Code
“The Tort Claims Act requires that any civil complaint
for money or damages first be presented to and rejected by the pertinent public
entity (Gov. Code, §§ 910, 912.4, 912.8, 945.4).” (Munoz v. State of
California (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1767, 1776.) “Government Code section
911.2 requires the claim relating to a cause of action for death or for injury
to person or to personal property be presented not later than six months after
the accrual of the cause of action.” (Munoz, 33 Cal.App.4th at 1776.) “Generally
speaking, no suit for money or damages may be brought against a public entity
on a cause of action for which a claim is required to be presented until a
written claim has been presented to the public entity and has been acted upon
by the board, or has been deemed to have been rejected by the board. (Munoz,
33 Cal.App.4th at 1776 citing Gov. Code, §945.4; Ocean Services Corp. v.
Ventura Port Dist. (1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1762, 1775.)
Here, Petitioner filed a claim on June 27, 2023
against GUSD for incidents which occurred on August 17, 2022, October 6, 2022,
January 25, 2023, and February 23, 2023. (Marcus Decl. ¶3; Attachment A.) 
On July 18, 2023, Tamatha Chipp, a Claims Examiner for
GUSD, informed Petitioner that claims presented to GUSD as to activities
occurring from August 17, 2022 to December 26, 2022 are being returned because
they were not presented within six months. 
O, in other words, it appears as if the August 17,
2022 and October 6, 2022 claims were being rejected for not being presented
within six months after the event or occurrence because the claims were not filed
until June 27, 2023, which after 6 months from both the August 17, 2022 and
October 6, 2022 dates. 
The July 18, 2022 letter from the Claims Examiner also
stated that activities occurring since December 27, 2022 are being
investigated. 
That is to say, it appears that the January 25, 2023
and February 23, 2023 events are still being investigated. 
Therefore, the August 17, 2022 and October 6, 2022
incidents are the two incidents relevant for purposes of this petition since
those were the two incidents that were rejected for not being presented within
six months of the occurrences. 
“Under Government Code section 945.4, presentation of
a timely claim is a condition precedent to the commencement of suit against the
public entity. However, if the injured party fails to file a timely claim, a
written application may be made to the public entity for leave to present such
claim. (Gov. Code, §911.4, subd. (a).) If the public entity denies the
application, Government Code section 946.6 authorizes the injured party to
petition the court for relief from the claim requirements.” (Munoz, 33
Cal.App.4th at 1777.)
“The court must grant the petition under Government
Code section946.6, subdivision (c) if the claimant demonstrates by a
preponderance of the evidence the application to the public entity under
Government Code section 911.4 was made within a reasonable time not exceeding
one year after the accrual of the cause of action, and one of the other four
requirements listed in Government Code section 946.6, subdivision (c) is met.
In determining whether relief is warranted, the court will consider the
petition, any affidavits submitted in support of or in opposition to the
petition, and any other evidence presented at the hearing.” (Munoz, 33
Cal.App.4th at 1777-78 citing Gov Code §946.6(e) and Bettencourt v. Los Rios
Community College Dist. (1986) 42 Cal.3d 270, 275.)
Here, Petitioner did not timely comply in order to be
granted relief. Petitioner submitted his application for leave to present a
late claim to GUSD on November 22, 2023. (Decl. Marcus ¶5, Exhibit C.) 
Petitioner submitted his application for leave to
present a late claim over a year after the accrual of the two dates of the August
17, 2022 and October 6, 2022 injuries.
Since Petitioner either misunderstood the relevant
statutes or omitted the relevant portions of the relevant statutes, the Court
will cite the statutes below. 
Petitioner cites Gov. Code § 946.6(c)(2) as its basis
for relief, but Petitioner disregards several portions of § 946.6.
“If an application for leave to present a claim is
denied or deemed to be denied pursuant to Section 911.6, a petition may be made
to the court for an order relieving the petitioner from Section 945.4.” (Gov.
Code § 946.6(a).)
The petition shall show
each of the following:
(1) That application
was made to the board under Section 911.4 and was denied or deemed denied.
(2) The reason for
failure to present the claim within the time limit specified in Section 911.2.
(3) The information
required by Section 910.
The petition shall be
filed within six months after the application to the board is denied or deemed
to be denied pursuant to Section 911.6.” 
(Gov. Code §946.6(b)(1)-(3).)
Here it appears as if petitioner complied with § 946.6(b)(1)
and (3); however, Petitioner makes no mention of the reason for failure to
present the claim within the time limit specified in Section 911.2. Thus,
Petitioner did not comply with 946.6(b)(2).
The petitioner does appear to comply with the
requirement that the petition be filed within six months after the application
to the board is denied or deemed to be denied pursuant to § 911.6 because this
petition was filed on January 26, 2024, just 20 days after January 6, 2024, the
date Petitioner alleges the application was deemed to have been denied (based
on 45 days of silence after the application being filed on November 22, 2023).
The court shall relieve
the petitioner from the requirements of Section 945.4 if the court finds that
the application to the board under Section 911.4 was made within a reasonable
time not to exceed that specified in subdivision (b) of Section 911.4 and
was denied or deemed denied pursuant to Section 911.6 and that
one or more of the following is applicable:
(1) The failure to
present the claim was through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect unless the public entity establishes that it would be prejudiced in the
defense of the claim if the court relieves the petitioner from the requirements
of Section 945.4.
(2) The person who
sustained the alleged injury, damage, or loss was a minor during all of the
time specified in Section 911.2 for the presentation of the claim.
(3) The person who
sustained the alleged injury, damage, or loss was a minor during any of the
time specified in Section 911.2 for the presentation of the claim, provided the
application is presented within six months of the person turning 18 years of
age or a year after the claim accrues, whichever occurs first.
(4) The person who
sustained the alleged injury, damage, or loss was physically or mentally
incapacitated during all of the time specified in Section 911.2 for the
presentation of the claim and by reason of that disability failed to present a
claim during that time.
(5) The person who
sustained the alleged injury, damage, or loss was physically or mentally
incapacitated during any of the time specified in Section 911.2 for the
presentation of the claim and by reason of that disability failed to present a
claim during that time, provided the application is presented within six months
of the person no longer being physically or mentally incapacitated, or a year
after the claim accrues, whichever occurs first.
(6) The person who
sustained the alleged injury, damage, or loss died before the expiration of the
time specified in Section 911.2 for the presentation of the claim.
(Gov. Code §946.6(c)(1)-(6) [emph added].)
Here, Petitioner argues that relief is appropriate
based on § 946.6(c)(2) based on the Petitioner’s status as a minor; however,
Petitioner completely ignores the preliminary requirement of 946.6(c) that
states the court has to find that the application to the board under Section
911.4 was “made within a reasonable time not to exceed that specified in
subdivision (b) of Section 911.4.” 
In relevant part of  § 911.4(b), “The application shall be
presented to the public entity as provided in Article 2 (commencing with
Section 915) within a reasonable time not to exceed one year after the
accrual of the cause of action.” (Gov. Code § 911.4(b) [emph. added].)
Further, as noted in Munoz, “The court must
grant the petition under Government Code section § 946.6, subdivision (c) if
the claimant demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence the
application to the public entity under Government Code section 911.4 was made
within a reasonable time not exceeding one year after the accrual of the cause
of action, and one of the other four requirements listed in Government
Code section 946.6, subdivision (c) is met.” (Munoz, 33 Cal.App.4th at
1777 [emph. added].)
Here, the application to the public entity under § 911.4
was not submitted until November 22, 2023 (Decl. Marcus ¶5)—more than one year
after the accrual of the cause of action for the dates of injury on August 17,
2022 and October 6, 2022.
“Filing a late-claim application within one year after
the accrual of a cause of action is a jurisdictional prerequisite to a claim-relief
petition.” (Munoz, 33 Cal.App.4th at 1779 citing Santee v. Santa
Clara County Office of Education (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 702, 713.) 
“When the underlying application to file a late claim
is filed more than one year after the accrual of the cause of action, the court
is without jurisdiction to grant relief under Government Code section 946.6.” (Munoz,
33 Cal.App.4th at 1779 citing Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. County of Santa Clara
(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 480, 488.)

Claim Against a governmental. 
The application for leave
to present a late claim was submitted on November 22, 2023 to GUSD—over a year
after the dates of accrual for the two incidents on August 17, 2022 and October
6, 2022. 
The Court will hear
argument.
