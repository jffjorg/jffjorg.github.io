The Court has found that the Defendant's process for electronically signing the agreement, which includes creating an account, entering personal information, and electronically acknowledging the agreement, is sufficient to meet the standard described in Ruiz v. Moss Bros. Auto Group, Inc. Therefore, the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration is granted.
