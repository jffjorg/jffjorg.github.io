MOVING PARTY: Defendant
Seung Jae Baek (“Moving Defendant”)  
 
RESPONDING PARTIES:
Plaintiffs A Plus Fabric, Inc.; Q Textile, Inc.; and Elliot Tishbi 
 
            The Court has considered the moving
and opposition papers. No reply papers were filed. Any reply papers were
required to have been filed and served at least five court days before the
hearing pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. § 1005(b).   
 
BACKGROUND
            Plaintiffs
filed a complaint against Defendants arising from an allegedly fraudulent loan
scheme, alleging 24 causes of action including intentional misrepresentation,
intentional fraudulent concealment, and negligent misrepresentation.  
 
            On
June 13, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel the deposition of Moving
Defendant. Plaintiffs’ motion to compel the deposition of Moving Defendant also
requested monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,237.15 against Moving
Defendant for misuse of the discovery process. 
            
            On
September 14, 2023, after hearing oral argument, the Court granted Plaintiffs’
motion to compel the deposition of Moving Defendant. The Court granted
Plaintiffs’ request for monetary sanctions against Moving Defendant and awarded
Plaintiffs reasonable monetary sanctions against Moving Defendant in the amount
of $3,877.15. The Court ordered Moving Defendant to pay such monetary sanctions
to Plaintiffs within 30 days of the date of the Court’s order. On September 14,
2023, Plaintiffs filed and served a Notice of Ruling as to the Court’s order on
the motion to compel the deposition of Moving Defendant.  
 
            On
September 20, 2023, Moving Defendant filed and served a motion for
reconsideration (the “Motion”).[1][2]Moving
Defendant seeks reconsideration of the Court’s September 14, 2023 order on the
grounds that the Court requiring Moving Defendant to pay monetary sanctions in
the amount of $4,237.15 is excessive. The Motion is made on the grounds that
the Court should have denied or reduced groundless costs of $4,237.15, which it
claims is extremely excessive in light of the malicious motion to compel
deposition. On October 16, 2023, Plaintiffs filed and served their opposition
to the Motion. The Court finds that the Motion is timely pursuant to Code Civ.
Proc. § 1008(b). 
 
As to the Motion, Moving Defendant
asserts that: (1) Moving Defendant reasonably informed Plaintiffs of possible
dates to participate in a deposition; (2) Moving Defendant provided all of
Plaintiffs’ discovery requests within Moving Defendant’s best efforts; (3)
Moving Defendant was a scapegoat in the course of Plaintiffs’ scheme of
warehouse fire insurance claim; (4) Plaintiffs’ deposition request was very
much planned for an ulterior motive; and (5) the Court should not have accepted
groundless costs of $4,237.15 as to the motion to compel. In opposition to the
Motion, Plaintiffs contend that the Motion is frivolous. 
 
Preliminary Issues 
            Initially,
the Court finds that Moving Defendant’s contention is misplaced as to the
amount of monetary sanctions the Court ordered Moving Defendant to pay. The
Court’s September 14, 2023 order did not award Plaintiffs costs of $4,237.15. Although
Plaintiffs requested monetary sanctions against Moving Defendant in the amount
of $4,237.15, the Court’s September 14, 2023 order on the motion to compel
deposition ordered Moving Defendant to pay monetary sanctions of $3,877.15.
(September 14, 2023 Minute Order at p.4.) Despite Moving Defendant’s inaccurate
contention, the Court did not award Plaintiffs monetary sanctions against
Moving Defendant in the amount of $4,237.15. 
 
            Additionally,
Moving Defendant’s declaration in support of the Motion was not filed and
served with the Motion. Moving Defendant’s declaration in support of the Motion
was filed with the Court on October 16, 2023. The proof of service as to the
declaration in support of the Motion shows that it was served on Plaintiffs on
October 12, 2023. The Court, however, will exercise its discretion and will
consider the late-filed declaration of Moving Defendant under California Rules
of Court, Rule 3.1300(d). 
 
DISCUSSION
            Code
Civ. Proc. § 1008(a) requires that a motion for reconsideration be based on new
or different facts, circumstances, or law. 
(New York Times Co. v. Superior
Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212.) 
A party seeking reconsideration must also provide a satisfactory
explanation for the failure to produce the evidence at an earlier time. (Id.) 
A trial court’s ruling on a motion for reconsideration is reviewed under
the abuse of discretion standard.  (Id.) 
California Code of Civil Procedure,
Section 1008(a) provides that “[w]hen an application for an order has been made
to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or
granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within
10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order .
. . [may] make application to the same judge or court that made the order, to
reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order.”  “The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.”  (Code
Civ. Proc. § 1008(a).)  A trial court has
discretion with respect to granting a motion for reconsideration.  (New
York Times Co. v. Superior Court, supra, 135 Cal.App.4th 206,
212.)
 


 
Issue No.1: Reasonable Diligence 
            The
burden under section 1008 is comparable to that of a party seeking a new trial
on the ground of newly discovered evidence: the information must be such that
the moving party could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered or
produced it at the trial.  (New York Times Co. v. Superior Court, supra,
135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212-213.)  The
party seeking reconsideration must provide not only new evidence but also a
satisfactory explanation for the failure to produce that evidence at an earlier
time.  (Mink v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1342.)  If the trial court believes reconsideration
is warranted, it can amend, modify or revoke its previous order.  (Glade
v. Glade (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1441, 1457.) 
A trial court’s ruling on a motion for reconsideration is reviewed under
the abuse of discretion standard.  (Id.) 
In the context of motions for reconsideration, there is “a strict
requirement of diligence.”  (Garcia v.
Hejmadi (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 674, 690.) 
 
 
            In
support of the Motion, Moving Defendant presents a declaration that fails to
show new facts, law, or circumstances to warrant reconsideration of the Court’s
September 14, 2023 order. The declaration of Moving Defendant appears to argue
the merits of the complaint and seeks to absolve Moving Defendant of any
liability in this action. (Baek Decl., ¶¶ 1-29.)  The declaration is void of any new facts,
law, or circumstances to warrant reconsideration of the Court’s September 14,
2023 order. The crux of Moving Defendant’s declaration is that: (1) the Court
granted Plaintiffs’ motion to compel deposition without reviewing Moving
Defendant’s opposition (Id., ¶ 32); (2) the Court granted Plaintiffs’
malicious motion to compel deposition and groundless attorney fee as a penalty
of $4,237.15 against Moving Defendant (Id., ¶ 33); and (3) the Court’s
award of monetary sanctions is a penalty and is extremely excessive,
unreasonable, and looks as if it helps and encourages Plaintiffs’ criminal
conduct (Id., ¶ 34.) 
 
            Moving
Defendant’s contention that the Court did not review the opposition to
Plaintiffs’ motion to compel deposition is inaccurate. The Court’s September
14, 2023 Minute Order states that “[t]he Court has considered the moving and
opposition papers.” Moreover, the Court finds that the basis of the Motion is
inaccurate as the Court did not impose monetary sanctions against Moving
Defendant in the amount of $4,237.15. The Court ordered Moving Defendant to pay
monetary sanctions to Plaintiffs arising from the motion to compel deposition
in the amount of $3,877.15. The Court also finds that Moving Defendant’s
attempts to litigate the merits and defenses to the complaint through the
Motion is improper and irrelevant.[3] Even
if Moving Defendant had presented new facts, circumstances, or law—which Moving
Defendant has not—Moving Defendant has not made a showing of reasonable
diligence. Moving Defendant merely argues—without evidentiary support—that the
Court’s award of monetary sanctions is excessive. (Motion at 8:13-21.) The
Motion raises arguments that are not relevant to a motion for reconsideration. In
sum, Moving Defendant has failed to present new facts, law, or circumstances with
reasonable diligence to warrant reconsideration either in the Motion or in the
declaration in support of the Motion. Although Moving Defendant is a pro per
litigant, pro per litigants are held to the same standards as
attorneys. (Kobayashi v. Superior Court (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 536,
543.) 
 
The Court therefore exercises its
discretion and DENIES the Motion. 
 
             Moving Party is ordered to give notice of this
ruling. 
 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
