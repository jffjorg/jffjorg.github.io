The judge has considered the defendant's motion for reconsideration of the court's order to pay a penalty of $4,237.15. The defendant claims that the court's award of monetary sanctions is excessive and that the court did not review the opposition to the motion to compel deposition. The court finds that the defendant's contention is misplaced and that the court did not impose monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,237.15. The court ordered the defendant to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,877.15. The court also finds that the defendant has not presented new facts, law, or circumstances with reasonable diligence to warrant reconsideration. Therefore, the court denies the motion.
