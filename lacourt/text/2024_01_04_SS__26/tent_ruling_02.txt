Farm v. Deleon, et al.MOTION
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
(CCP §
437c)
TENTATIVE RULING:  
 
Defendants Hertz Vehicles, LLC’s Motion for Summary Judgment
is GRANTED. 
 
MOVING DEFENDANT IS TO FILE AND SERVE A PROPOSED JUDGMENT
WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
 
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against
Defendants Dennis Deleon aka Dennis Martinez (“Defendant Deleon”) and Hertz
Vehicles, LLC (“Defendant Hertz”) on August 11, 2021. Defendant Hertz filed an
answer on December 1, 2021. 
 
Defendant Hertz
filed the instant Motion for Summary Judgment on October 20, 2023. Plaintiff
filed an opposition on December 26, 2023. 
 
Discussion
 
The Complaint alleges a single cause of action for subrogation
with respect to payments Plaintiff made to its insured following an automobile
accident allegedly caused by Defendant Deleon. (Compl., ¶¶6-9.) Defendant Hertz
allegedly owned the vehicle driven by Defendant Deleon, gave Defendant Deleon
implied or express permission to drive the vehicle, and negligently entrusted
Defendant Deleon with the vehicle. (Id. at ¶6.) 
 
Defendant Hertz for summary judgment on the Complaint
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 437c. A defendant seeking summary
judgment must show either (1)
that one or more elements of the cause of action cannot be established; or (2) that there is a complete
defense to that cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)
Plaintiff is under no evidentiary burden to produce rebuttal evidence until
Defendant meets its initial moving burden. (Binder v. Aetna Life Insurance
Company (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832, 839-840.) 
 
Defendant’s Initial Burden of Proof
 
The Motion is brought on the grounds that Defendant Hertz’s
liability is barred by the federal Graves Amendment, set forth at 49 USC
section 30106, which states in relevant part:
 
(a) In general.--An owner of a motor
vehicle that rents or leases the vehicle to a person (or an affiliate of the
owner) shall not be liable under the law of any State or political subdivision
thereof, by reason of being the owner of the vehicle (or an affiliate of the
owner), for harm to persons or property that results or arises out of the use,
operation, or possession of the vehicle during the period of the rental or
lease, if--
(1) the owner (or an affiliate of the
owner) is engaged in the trade or business of renting or leasing motor
vehicles; and
(2) there is no negligence or criminal
wrongdoing on the part of the owner (or an affiliate of the owner).
 
(49 USC, § 30106, subd. (a).) In support of the grounds for
judgment, Defendant Hertz provides evidence of the following facts as
undisputed. The accident giving rise to this litigation occurred on September
21, 2019. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 1; Exh. A, ¶6.) The subject
vehicle was driven at the time by Defendant Deleon. (Motion, Separate
Statement, Fact No. 2; Exh. D, Response Nos. 115.1, 120.3.) The vehicle was
owned by Defendant Hertz and leased by Defendant Deleon. (Motion, Separate
Statement, Fact Nos. 3-4; Exh. D, Response No. 120.5; Hall Decl., ¶2.) Defendant
Hertz was in the business of renting vehicles. (Motion, Hall Decl., ¶4.)
Plaintiff has no evidence that Defendant Hertz was at fault for the accident,
that the vehicle was negligently maintained, that Defendant Hertz negligently
entrusted the vehicle to Defendant Deleon, or that Defendant Hertz negligently
supervised Defendant Deleon. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 5-9; Exh.
D, Response Nos. 115.1 and 120.1; Hall Decl., ¶¶6-8.)
 
This evidence carries Defendant Hertz’s burden to show that no
triable issues of material fact exist regarding application of the Graves
Amendment to Defendant Hertz’ liability for Plaintiff’s damages. Specifically,
it is undisputed that Defendant Hertz is in the business of renting motor
vehicles and that Plaintiff has no evidence to show that Defendant Hertz acted
with negligence or criminal wrongdoing. The burden now shifts to Plaintiff to
demonstrate the existence of a triable issue of material fact regarding either
Graves Amendment factor. 
 
Burden to Demonstrate the Existence of a Triable Issue of
Material Fact
 
Plaintiff untimely filed and served an opposition to the
instant Motion. The opposition was required to be filed and served by December
21, 2023. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (b)(2).) Instead, the opposition was
not filed until December 26, 2023 and was served by electronic mail on December
22, 2023. (Decl. of Service, filed 12/26/23.) Service of the opposition,
therefore, was effective on December 27, 2023 making it six days untimely.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(4)(B).) 
 
Even if the Court exercised its discretion to consider the
opposition, Plaintiff has not carried its burden of proof to demonstrate the
existence of a triable issue of material fact regarding the cause of action for
negligent entrustment. (See Opp., pp. 3:15-4:4.) The opposition is not
supported by any citation to or submission of evidence. (Ibid.) Indeed,
no opposing separate statement of facts has been filed. The supporting
declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel also has no substantive content or exhibits
attached. (Decl. in Opp., filed 12/26/23.) Finally, the case to which Plaintiff
cites is not binding and is inapplicable to the facts of this case. Russ v.
XPO Logistics, LLC (D. Minn. 2022) 2022 WL 3371132, is a federal district
court case in which the court ruled that there was evidence of a factual
dispute regarding the lessor's  knowledge
of the lessee’s history of unsafe practices. (Russ v. XPO Logistics, LLC
(D. Minn. 2022) 2022 WL 3371132, at *9.) Here, Plaintiff offers no evidence
that Defendant Hertz knew anything about Defendant Deleon prior to leasing him
the vehicle. 
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Defendants Hertz Vehicles, LLC’s Motion for
Summary Judgment is GRANTED. 
 
MOVING DEFENDANT IS TO FILE AND SERVE A PROPOSED JUDGMENT
WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
