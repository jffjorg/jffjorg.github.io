And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Hertz Vehicles, LLC's motion for summary judgment. This means that the court has ruled in favor of Hertz Vehicles, LLC and has determined that it is not liable for the automobile accident that occurred on September 21, 2019. The judge's ruling is based on the Graves Amendment, which bars liability for the owner of a motor vehicle if the accident was not caused by the owner's negligence or criminal wrongdoing.

The judge found that Hertz Vehicles, LLC had met its burden to show that it was not liable for the accident, and that Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company had failed to demonstrate the existence of a triable issue of material fact regarding the cause of action for negligent entrustment. The judge also noted that Plaintiff's opposition to the motion was untimely and lacked supporting evidence.

As a result of the judge's ruling, Defendant Hertz Vehicles, LLC is required to file and serve a proposed judgment within 20 days of this order.
