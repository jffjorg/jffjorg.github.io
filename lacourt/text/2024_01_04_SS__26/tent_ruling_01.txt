ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiff Luelle Llorens (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant
action for motor vehicle negligence against Defendant Rachel Nicole Lee (“Defendant”)
on August 9, 2021. Defendant filed an answer on May 4, 2022. On June 27, 2022,
the Court granted Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be relieved. (Minute Order,
06/27/22.)
 
On May 3, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s Motion to
Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, and Request for Sanctions, and Motion
to Compel Responses to Demand for Inspection, and Request for Sanctions. (Minute Order, 05/03/23.) 
 
Defendant filed the instant Motion
for Terminating Sanctions on October
6, 2023, which was set for hearing on November 8, 2023. On November 8,
2023, Defendant appeared and the hearing was continued to November 15, 2023 due
to the Court’s unavailability. (Minute Order, 11/08/23.) Defendant was ordered
to give notice of the continuance. (Ibid.) On November 15, 2023, the
Court continued the hearing to allow Defendant to file proof of service of the
notice of continuance. (Minute Order, 11/15/23.) Defendant filed the notice of
continuance on December 7, 2023. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
Where a party willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts
have discretion to impose terminating, issue, evidence or monetary sanctions.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, subds. (d), (g); R.S. Creative, Inc. v.
Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.) The court should
look to the totality of the circumstances in determining whether terminating
sanctions are appropriate. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225,
1246.) Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified where there is a willful
discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and evidence showing that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery rules. (Van
Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) “[A] penalty as
severe as dismissal or default is not authorized where noncompliance with
discovery is caused by an inability to comply rather than willfulness or bad
faith.” (Brown v. Sup. Ct. (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.) “The court
may impose a terminating sanction by one of the following orders: 
 
(1)   An
order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process.
 
(2)   An
order staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed.
 
(3)   An
order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that party.
 
(4)   An
order rendering a judgment by default against that party.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).)
 
Discussion
 
The Court granted Defendant’s Motion to Compel Responses to
Form Interrogatories, and Request for Sanctions, and Motion to Compel Responses
to Demand for Inspection, and Request for Sanctions on May 3, 2023. (Minute
Order, 05/02/23; Motion, Blamires Decl., Exh. C.) Pursuant to the order,
Plaintiff was to serve Defendant with responses to the discovery and pay
sanctions of $412.28. (Ibid.) Notice of the ruling was served on
Plaintiff on June 21, 2023. (Ibid.) To date, Plaintiff has not complied
with the order to produce documents or pay sanctions. (Id. at ¶4.) 
 
The Court finds that terminating sanctions are warranted for
Plaintiff’s non-compliance with the discovery order. Despite notice of the
Court’s ruling, Plaintiff failed to serve responses as ordered. Nor has
Plaintiff filed an opposition to this noticed motion. This demonstrates that
compliance with the Court’s orders cannot be achieved through lesser sanctions.
Although terminating sanctions are a harsh penalty, “[t]he court [is] not
required to allow a pattern of abuse to continue ad infinitum.” (Mileikowsky
v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 280.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant
Rachel Nicole Lee’s Motion for
Terminating Sanctions is GRANTED.
PLAINTIFF LUELLE LLORENS’ COMPLAINT, FILED ON AUGUST 9, 2021, IS DISMISSED WITH
PREJUDICE.
