ANALYSIS:
 
On March 13, 2023, Plaintiff PLS
Custom Framing Inc. (“Cross-Defendant”)
filed the verified Complaint in this action against Defendants Anaya
Building Construction, Inc. (“Cross-Complainant”) and BCAH Enterprises, LLC
(“Defendant BCAH”). Cross-Complaint filed its answer and cross-complaint on May
1, 2023. On May 3, 2023, the Court entered Defendant BCAH’s default; it appears
that the Court still allowed Defendant BCAH to file an answer on May 9, 2023. 
 
Cross-Complainant
filed the instant Motion for Leave to File First Amended Cross-Complaint on
October 27, 2023. Cross-Defendant filed an opposition on December 15, 2023. 
 
Discussion
 
The Motion is
brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 473, subdivision (a) and
403.030. Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, provides that “[t]he court may, in furtherance of
justice and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any
pleading…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).) The policy favoring
amendments and resolving all matters in the same dispute is “so strong that it
is a rare case in which denial of leave to amend can be justified. [Citation.]”
(Howard v. County of San Diego
(2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428.) “Although courts are bound to apply a
policy of great liberality in permitting amendments to the complaint at any
stage of the proceedings, up to and including trial [citations], this policy
should be applied only ‘where no prejudice is shown to the adverse party . . .
. [citation].  A different result is
indicated ‘where inexcusable delay and probable prejudice to the opposing
party’ is shown. [Citation].” (Magpali
v. Farmers Group (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 487.) Where a proposed
amendment opens an entirely new substantive area of injury on the eve of trial
without any explanation for why the major change had not been made long before,
denial of leave is appropriately ordered in the court’s discretion.  (Id.)
 
Here,
Cross-Complainant explains that it filed a cross-complaint on May 1, 2023 that
sought damages in excess of the jurisdictional limit of this court. (Motion,
Greenberg Decl., ¶4.) Cross-Complainant also paid the reclassification fee. (Ibid.)
However, Cross-Complainant was only recently informed that the action was not
reclassified because the cross-complaint did not contain the necessary
reclassification language on its face. (Id. at ¶5.) Cross-Complainant
now seeks leave to amend to include that language on the proposed First Amended
Cross-Complaint. 
 
Under Code of Civil
Procedure section 403.030, if a cross-complainant files a cross-complaint that
does not meet the jurisdictional requirements of the limited jurisdiction
court, “the caption of the cross-complaint shall state that the action or
proceeding is a limited civil case to be reclassified by cross-complaint, or
words to that effect. The party at the time of filing the cross-complaint shall
pay the reclassification fees provided in Section 403.060, and the clerk shall
promptly reclassify the case.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 403.030.) Cross-Complainant
has already paid the reclassification fee such that allowing leave to amend
solely to include the necessary language is appropriate. 
 
The opposition
provides no basis to deny leave to amend. It refers to a number of unrelated
procedural problems that have no bearing on amendment or reclassification.
First, Cross-Defendant points out that Defendant BCAH’s answer filed on May 9,
2023 should be struck because its default was entered on May 3, 2023. Also, to
the extent Cross-Defendant complains that Cross-Complainant’s answer was not
verified, as required to respond to a verified complaint, Plaintiff may seek
leave to strike the answers. Cross-Defendant also complains that improper
discovery was served and it will be prejudiced by reclassification. The
opposition cites no authority that either the type of discovery served, nor
prejudice to another party, are grounds to deny reclassification. The case it
cites did not involve amendment in order to achieve reclassification and
referred to prejudice that results when trial is imminent. (Citing P&D
Consultants, Inc. v. City of Carlsbad (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1345.) This
is not relevant in this action, where the trial date is still nine months away.
Nor is the opposition supported by any declaration that demonstrates the
prejudice Plaintiff would suffer as a result of the amendment. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Based on the foregoing, Cross-Complainant Anaya Building Construction,
Inc.’s Motion for Leave to File First Amended Cross-Complaint is GRANTED. CROSS-COMPLAINANT
IS TO FILE THE FIRST AMENDED CROSS-COMPLAINT WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS OF THIS
ORDER.
 
UPON THE FILING OF THE FIRST AMENDED CROSS-COMPLAINT, THE
CASE IS RECLASSIFIED AS AN UNLIMITED CIVIL CASE AND TRANSFERRED TO THE
RECLASSIFICATION/TRANSFER DESK FOR COLLECTION OF FEES AND REASSIGNMENT OF THE
CASE TO AN INDEPENDENT CALENDAR COURT. CROSS-COMPLAINANT IS TO PAY THE
RECLASSIFICATION FEE WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
