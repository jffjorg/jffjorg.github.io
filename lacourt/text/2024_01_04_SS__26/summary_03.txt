```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge denies the Defendant's renewed motion to transfer the action to small claims court. The Defendant previously filed a motion to quash service and appealed a Small Claims judgment, but the Court has already denied similar requests. The Judge notes that Code of Civil Procedure section 116.223 does not provide for the transfer of cases from the limited jurisdiction court to small claims, and that the Defendant has not shown new or different facts or circumstances to support the motion. The Judge also notes that the Defendant failed to file a supporting declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. As a result, the motion is denied.
