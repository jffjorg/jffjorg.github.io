And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions and dismissed the plaintiff's complaint with prejudice. The plaintiff failed to serve responses to discovery and pay sanctions despite being ordered to do so. The defendant filed the motion and appeared at the hearing, while the plaintiff did not file an opposition. The judge has determined that terminating sanctions are warranted due to the plaintiff's non-compliance with the discovery order and the totality of the circumstances. The judge has also noted that the court has discretion to impose terminating sanctions where there is a willful discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and evidence showing that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery rules.
