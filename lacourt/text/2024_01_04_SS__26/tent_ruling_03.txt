SM
10000 Property LLC v. Naylor, et al.MOTION
TO TRANSFER ACTION
(CCP § 116.223)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant Heather Naylor’s
Renewed Motion to Transfer Action to Small Claims is DENIED. 
 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
On March 8, 2022, Plaintiff SM 10000 Property LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed this action for breach of lease agreement
against Defendant Heather Naylor
(“Defendant”). The case was originally assigned to an
unlimited jurisdiction courtroom. Plaintiff filed a proof of substitute service
of the Summons and Complaint on April 18, 2022. Defendant’s first motion to
quash service of the Summons and Complaint (“the First Motion to Quash”) was
granted by the unlimited jurisdiction court on July 7, 2022. (Minute Order,
07/07/22.) Specifically, the court ruled that service of the Smmons and
Complaint at a post office box was appropriate but that Plaintiff did not
demonstrate due diligence at personal service. (Ibid.) 
 
Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint on October 6,
2022, and on Novmeber 16, 2022, the case was transferred to the limited
jurisdiction court. (Minute Order, 11/16/22.) Plaintiff filed a proof of
substitute service of the Summons and First Amended Complaint on November 18,
2022. 
 
Defendant, specially appearing, filed a second Motion
to Quash Service of the Summons and Complaint (“the Second Motion to Quash”) on
December 13, 2022. Concurrent with the proceeding in this action, Defendant
filed a Small Claims action against Plaintiff, under LASC Case No. 22SMSC00457,
on March 16, 2022. The Small Claims action was resolved in favor of Defendant
on December 5, 2022. (LASC Case No. 22SMSC00457, Minute Order, 12/05/22.)
Plaintiff appealed the Small Claims judgment and following a trial de novo on
March 15, 2023, the small claims judgment in favor of Defendant was set aside.
(LASC Case No. 22SMSC00457, Minute Order, 03/15/23.)
 
The Court granted
Defendant’s second Motion to Quash on February 24, 2023, after taking the
matter under submission. (Minute Order, 02/24/23.) Plaintiff filed proof of
service by substitute service on March 8, 2023. On June 22, 2023, the Court
denied Defendant’s third Motion to Quash Service of the Summons and Complaint
and Motion to Transfer Action to Small Claims. (Minute Order, 06/22/23.) 
 
Defendant filed the
instant Motion to Transfer on October 13, 2023. Plaintiff filed an opposition
on October 27, 2023.
 

Discussion
 
In the instant Motion, Defendant asks the Court to
transfer this action to small claims pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 116.223. The Court previously denied Defendant’s request to transfer
the action to small claims on June 22, 2023. (Minute Order, 06/22/23, pp. 3-4.)
Specifically, the Court ruled:
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 116.223, however, does not
provide for the transfer of cases from the limited jurisdiction court to small
claims. Rather, it provides that “It is the intent of the Legislature that
landlords of residential real property and their tenants have the
option
to litigate” COVID-19 rental debt disputes in small claims court regardless of
the amount in controversy and regardless of the jurisdictional limit of the
small claims court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 116.223, subds. (a)(4), (b)(1).) This
does not require that the limited jurisdiction court
transfer this action to small claims, or even that transfer of such a case is
appropriate once it has been filed. Rather, it merely provides that such cases
can be filed in the small claims court. Nor does Defendant address this
argument on reply.
 
Therefore, the request to transfer the action to small claims
court is denied.
 
(Ibid.) When a party seeks the same relief
that was previously denied, it must bring a renewed motion pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (b). (California Correctional
Peace Officers Ass’n v. Virga (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 30, 43, fn. 11; see
also Tate v. Wilburn (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 150, 156-157.) When a motion
has been denied in whole or in part, the moving party may apply again for the
same relief at a later time only upon “new or different facts, circumstances or
law.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (b); see Graham v. Hansen (1982)
128 Cal.App.3d 965, 969-970.) 
 
Despite
being a renewed motion, Defendant has not filed a supporting declaration as
required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. 
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Defendant Heather
Naylor’s Renewed Motion to Transfer Action to Small Claims is DENIED. 
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
