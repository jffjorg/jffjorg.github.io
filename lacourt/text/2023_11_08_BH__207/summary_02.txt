And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for a hearing on the status of the parties in a case involving a dispute over a home construction project. The plaintiff, Daniel Fawcett, passed away in 2022, but his counsel continued to represent the estate in the arbitration proceeding. The defendants were not notified of the plaintiff's death until September 13, 2023. The defendants argue that they have been prejudiced by the failure to disclose the plaintiff's death, as they were unable to examine the plaintiff's claims and assertions in the Second Amended Complaint. The plaintiff's counsel argues that the estate has retained counsel to continue representing the estate in the case, and that the court lacks jurisdiction to decide the issues presented in the motion without a party first requesting to vacate the stay order. The judge concludes that the court lacks jurisdiction to decide the issues presented in the motion, and that the defendants shall provide notice of the court's ruling and file a proof of service regarding the same.
