And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff, Lucky Star Kitchen, Inc., moves for an order compelling further responses from the defendants, Li Liu, Tian You Feng, Inc., Yuxi Liu, and Yan Chen, regarding their discovery requests. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants provided deficient responses to the discovery requests and seeks further responses. The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses and denies the plaintiff's requests for sanctions. The judge finds that the plaintiff's motions are untimely, as the parties agreed to extend the deadline for filing a motion to compel.
