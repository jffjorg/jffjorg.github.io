RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Plaintiff moves for an order
compelling Defendants to provide further responses to its requests for the
production of documents and form interrogatories. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Lucky Star
Kitchen, Inc.’s (“Plaintiff”) claim that Defendants Li Liu, Tian You Feng,
Inc., Yuxi Liu, and Yan Chen engaged in the fraudulent transfer of assets.
Plaintiff filed this complaint on May 11, 2023, alleging one cause of action
for violation of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses is DENIED.
 
            Plaintiff’s
requests for sanctions are denied. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
On receipt of a response to discovery requests, the party requesting may
move for an order compelling further responses for interrogatories (Code Civ.
Proc. 2030.300), requests for admission (Cod. Civ. Proc. section 2033.290), and
request for production (Code Civ. Proc. section 2031.310). “Unless notice of
this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or
any supplemental verified response, or any specific later date to which the
requesting party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the
requesting party waives any right to compel further response to the requests
for admission.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 2033.290, subd. (c).
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff
moves for an order compelling further responses to its discovery requests.
Plaintiff seeks to compel further responses from Li Liu as to its requests for
the production of documents and further responses from Yan Chen as its form
interrogatories. Plaintiff provides that it served its discovery requests on
Defendants on August 4, 2023. (Qi Decl. at p.
2:10-12.) Plaintiff provides that Defendant provided deficient responses on
October 4, 2023. (Id. at p. 2:13.) Defendant provided supplemental
responses on November 14, 2023. (Id. at p. 2:19.)
 
            Plaintiff provides that the parties agreed to extend the
deadline to file a motion to compel further responses 60 days starting from January
10, 2024. (Qi Decl. at p. 2:22-24.) However, in the attached correspondence,
Defendants’ counsel provides “I agree you have 60 days to bring a Motion to
Compel from today’s date for any outstanding discovery.” (Exhibit 5b at p. 2.)
This email was sent on December 5, 2023. (Ibid.) The present motions
were filed on February 14, and 15, 2024. Under the parties’ agreement to extend
the deadline, Plaintiff’s motions are untimely. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses is DENIED.
 
            Plaintiff’s
requests for sanctions are denied.
