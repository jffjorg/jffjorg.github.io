Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Mikayel Israyelyan v. Krikor Bardakjian, regarding the quiet title claim. The plaintiff, Mikayel Israyelyan, has moved for summary adjudication, alleging that he was wrongfully denied his 50% interest in the 485 Cliff Drive property when the defendant, Krikor Bardakjian, transferred the property from 485 Cliff Dr, LLC to himself without his consent. The plaintiff has provided evidence that he and the defendant were both 50% members of 485 Cliff Dr, LLC, and that he did not receive compensation or reimbursement for the property's purchase and renovation. The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication, determining that the plaintiff's interest in the Subject Property is 50%. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for further relief, as the plaintiff has failed to establish what remedy he is seeking.
