And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling grants in part the motion for terminating sanctions filed by the plaintiff, Michael Brang, against the defendant, General Motors, LLC. The plaintiff seeks terminating and monetary sanctions against the defendant for the defendant's failure to produce its Person(s) Most Knowledgeable (PMK) witness for deposition and failure to produce documents responsive to requests for production. The judge finds that the defendant has engaged in the misuse of the discovery process, but declines to issue terminating sanctions against the defendant. Instead, the judge orders the defendant to produce its PMK for an additional deposition on certain matters of examination and to produce documents responsive to certain requests for production. The judge also imposes monetary sanctions of $1,500.00 against the defendant and its counsel to be paid within 45 days.
