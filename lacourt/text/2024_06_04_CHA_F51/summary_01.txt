Significant Statements:

* "To succeed on an alter ego theory, there are two general requirements: (1) that there be such unity of interest and ownership that the separate personalities of the corporation and the individual no longer exist and (2) that, if the acts are treated as those of the corporation alone, an inequitable result will follow." - Mesler v.

Gulsvig (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 347
