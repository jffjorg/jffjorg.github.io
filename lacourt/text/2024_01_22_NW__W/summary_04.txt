And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Kambiz Kamangar's motion for an order that the truth of each matter specified in each Request for Admission (Set One) served on Plaintiffs Yosef Cohen and Vahe Ter-Galstyan on September 7, 2023, be deemed admitted and conclusively established for all purposes in this action. The judge has also granted Defendant Kamangar's request for mandatory monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,687.95 against Plaintiffs.

The judge's ruling is based on the fact that Plaintiffs failed to timely respond to Defendant Kamangar's properly served discovery request. The judge found that Plaintiffs have waived any objections to the demand and that the court shall grant the motion unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.

The judge has also granted Defendant Kamangar's request for judicial notice of the criminal docket, guilty judgment, and guilty plea of Plaintiffs Yosef Cohen and Vahe Ter-Galstyan in Case No. 1:21-CR444, USA v. Cohen in United States District Court, New York Southern.
