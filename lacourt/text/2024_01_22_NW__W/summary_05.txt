The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to be relieved as counsel, filed by Steven A. Roseman, Esq., Counsel for The Laurels Homeowners Association. The Judge agrees that the attorney-client relationship has broken down, and that the client has breached an agreement and obligation to counsel as to expenses and fees. The motion is granted based on the grounds that the attorney-client relationship has ceased to exist, and that it would be unreasonably difficult for the attorney to carry out their representation and professional responsibilities effectively. The next hearing is scheduled for a Case Management Conference on January 26, 2024, and the Judge reminds Counsel to warn the corporate plaintiff, Moufarrege, Inc., that they can only appear through counsel.
