BACKGROUND
 
On August 9, 2022, Plaintiffs Yosef
Cohen and Vahe Ter-Galstyan filed a complaint against Defendants World Tech
Toys, Inc., World Trading 23, Inc., Kevork Kouyoumjian, Kambiz Kamangar, and
Kamir Distribution, LLC asserting causes of action for (1) Breach of Oral Joint
Venture Agreement; (2) Unlawful, Fraudulent & Unfair Business Practices; (3)
Breach of Fiduciary Duty; and (4) Fraud.
 
Plaintiffs allege Defendant Kamangar
made fraudulent representations to Plaintiff Cohen regarding a business opportunity
arising from the Pandemic. Plaintiffs allege Defendant Kamangar represented to
Plaintiff Cohen Defendant KOUYOUMJIAN had extensive contacts in China as a
result of his companies, World Trading 23, Inc. and World Tech Toys, Inc.,
which were involved in importing goods from China for sale in the United States
and actively encouraged Plaintiff Cohen and Plaintiff Ter-Galstanyan to order
the gloves. Plaintiffs allege Defendants failed to perform in accordance with
the term so of the Agreement as well as their fiduciary duty. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Defendant Kambiz Kamangar’s Motion for
Order that Requests for Admission (Set One) be Deemed Admitted and for
Mandatory Monetary Sanctions [CCP §2033.280(B)(C) is GRANTED.
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
Defendant Kambiz Kamangar requests this
court take judicial notice of (2) the Criminal Docket retrieved from LexisNexis
for Case No. 1:21-CR444, USA v. Cohen in United States District Court, New York
Southern (Exh. 1); (2) the guilty Judgment entered against Plaintiff Yosef
Cohen in Case No. 1:21-CR444, USA v. Cohen in United States District Court, New
York Southern (Exh. 2); and (3) the guilty Judgment entered against Plaintiff
Vahe Ter-Galstanyan in Case No. 1:21-CR444, USA v. Cohen in United States District
Court, New York Southern (Exh. 3). 
 
The court GRANTS Defendant Kamangar’s
request for judicial notice. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant Kambiz Kamangar moves the
court for an order that the truth of each matter specified in each Requests for
Admission (Set One) served on Plaintiffs Yosef Cohen and Vahe Ter-Galstanyan on
September 7, 2023, be deemed admitted and conclusively established for all
purposes in this action. Defendant Kamangar also requests that mandatory
monetary sanctions in the total amount of $3,287.95 be imposed against
Plaintiffs Yosef Cohen and Vahe Ter-Galstanyan as the reasonable costs and
attorneys’ fees incurred by Defendant Kambiz Kamangar for these proceedings.
 
Where there has been no timely response to a request for admission
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may move
for an order that the truth of any matters specified in the requests and the
genuineness of any documents be deemed admitted, as well as a monetary
sanction. (CCP §2033.280(b).) The party who failed to respond waives any
objections to the demand, unless the court grants that party relief from the
waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially
compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result
of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. (CCP §2033.280(a)(1)-(2).) The
court shall grant the motion “unless it finds that the party to whom the
requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the
motion, a proposed response … in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”
(CCP §2033.280(c); St. Mary v. Sup. Ct. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762,
777-78.)
 
 On
July 3, 2023, counsel for Defendant Kamangar became aware that Plaintiffs Yosef
Cohen and Vahe Ter-Galstanyan had pled guilty to felonies involving money
laundering when counsel for Kouyumjian reached out to Plaintiff’s counsel
(copying Kamangar counsel) to determine whether Plaintiffs would be dismissing
this case, considering their criminal conviction status. (Cohen Decl. ¶3, Exh.
C.) On September 7, 2023, Defendant Kambiz Kamangar served Plaintiffs, and each
of them, their own specific discovery including Requests for Admission (Set One).
(Cohen Decl. ¶4, Exhs. A, B.) On October 9, 2023, Plaintiffs’ counsel sent an
email stating that he was aware that responses were due but, because Plaintiffs
had been (and continue to be) incarcerated, he sought an extension. (Cohen
Decl. ¶5, Exh. D.) Defense counsel granted the extension until November 8,
2023. (Cohen Decl. ¶6, Exh. E.) On November 14, 2023, having received no
responses or updates, Plaintiffs were advised that Defendant Kamangar would
also be moving to compel responses, deem Plaintiffs’ respective RFAs admitted
and seek sanctions. (Cohen Decl. ¶7, Exh. G.) 
 
The court finds Plaintiffs have failed
to timely respond to Defendant Kamangar’s properly served discovery request.
The court therefore grants Defendant Kamangar’s Motion for Order that Requests
for Admissions (Set One) be Deemed Admitted is GRANTED. 
 
Sanctions
 
Where a party fails to provide a timely
response to requests for admission, “[i]t is mandatory that the court impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the
party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (CCP
§2033.280(c).) 
 
Defendant seeks $3,287.95 in monetary
sanctions against Plaintiff. Defendant seeks $61.65 for reservation fees,
$22.30 and $4 for filing fees, $1,600.00 for four hours of preparing the
motion, $1,000.00 for 2.5 hours to review any opposition and prepare a reply.
(Cohen Decl. ¶9.) Counsel’s billing rate is $400. (Cohen Decl. 9.) 
 
The court grants Defendant’s request
for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,687.95.
