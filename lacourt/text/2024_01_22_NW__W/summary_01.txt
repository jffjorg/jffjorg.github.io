And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment filed by defendants Matthew Larrew, D.O. and CEP America-California. The defendants argue that there is no evidence to show that they breached their duty to provide medical care and treatment to decedent Joseph Shrauger, and that there is no proximate causal connection between their alleged negligent conduct and the decedent's death. The defendants present expert testimony from Dr. Michael S. Ritter, a Board-Certified Emergency Room Physician, who concludes that the defendants complied with the standard of care and that there is no act or omission by either defendant that caused or contributed to the decedent's death. The plaintiffs have failed to file an opposition to the motion, and therefore, the defendants are entitled to summary judgment.
