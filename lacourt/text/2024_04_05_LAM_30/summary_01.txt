Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the cross-complaint filed by defendant and cross-complainant Sung Ryong Cho, dba Mansoo Deungsim, against plaintiffs and cross-defendants Lee and Hyo S. Lee, as trustees of the Lee 2003 Family Trust.

The judge overruled the demurrer to the first three causes of action, finding that they state a cause of action. However, the judge sustained the demurrer to the fourth cause of action, finding that it fails to state a cause of action for negligence because it does not allege proximate cause.

The judge also addressed the issues of res judicata and collateral estoppel, finding that the doctrine of res judicata does not apply to the first, second, and third causes of action, and that the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not apply to any of the causes of action.

The judge granted leave to amend the cross-complaint to cure the deficiencies in the fourth cause of action.
