The
Court has considered the moving papers and Plaintiff’s Notice of Non-Opposition
as to the following motions: 1) Motion for Order Deeming Admitted the Truth of
Facts and Genuineness of Documents and Imposing Monetary Sanctions against
Victor Chongman Pak (“Pak”) or his Counsel (the “RFA Motion”); 2)   Motion to Compel Verified Responses without
Objections to Special and Form Interrogatories, and for Sanctions against Pak
or his Counsel (the “Interrogatory Motion”); and 3) Motion to Compel
Attendance, Testimony and Production of Documents at a Deposition, and for
Sanctions against JJWV Marketing Corporation (“JJWV”) or its Counsel (the “Deposition
Motion”).  
 
No
opposition was filed to any of the motions by either Defendants Pak, JJWV or
their counsel.
 
BACKGROUND
             Plaintiff alleges that Defendants imported for
sale 313 live specimens of Blacklip Abalone into LAX from Australia in November
2020 for sale on the wholesale fish market. 
Plaintiff alleges that a Restricted Species Permit is required to import
each live specimen and that Defendants did not have such a permit, nor did they
procure a fish wholesaler license as required by law in 2022.
 
            Plaintiff filed this action on January
4, 2023.  The operative complaint is the
First Amended Complaint filed on November 29, 2023, alleging (1) violation of the
California Civil Code’s Unfair Competition Law (“UCL”) Section 17200 based on
violation of Fish and Gaming Code (“FGC”) Section 2218 and 14 CCR 671(a); (2) violation
of UCL Section 17200 based on violations of 14 CCR 671.1(a); (3) violation of
UCL Section 17200 for violations of FGC section 8035; (4) violation of FGC
Section 2125 for violations of FGC Section 2218 and 14 CCR 671(a); (5)
violation of FGC Section 2125 for violations of 14 CCR 671.1(a).  
 


 
MEET AND CONFER 
            Plaintiff has fulfilled
its obligations to meet and confer with all parties against whom the motions
were filed. 
 
DISCUSSION
I.              
THE RFA MOTION
            CCP §2033.280
If
a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the following rules apply:
(a) The party to
whom the requests for admission are directed waives any objection to the
requests, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on
motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both
of the following conditions are satisfied:
            (1) The party has subsequently
served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210,
2033.220, and 2033.230.
            (2) The party's failure to serve a
timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
(b) The requesting
party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).
(c) The court
shall make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the
party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated this motion.        
 
Plaintiff is entitled
to an order deeming RFAs (Set One) Admitted as to Defendant Pak with sanctions.
Plaintiff
served Defendant Pak with Requests for Admissions (Set One) (the “RFAs”) on
September 19, 2023.  (Motion, Ex. A, Soto
Dec., ¶3.)  Defendant Pak failed to serve
any responses to the RFAs.  (Id.
at ¶¶18-19.)  Defendant Pak did not file
an opposition to this motion, nor has he served substantially compliant
responses.  Plaintiff is therefore
entitled to an order deeming the RFAs admitted against Pak.  
 
            Plaintiff
requests sanctions in the amount of $3,740 (11 hours @ $340/hr) against
Defendant Pak or his counsel on the RFA Motion. 
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions in the reasonable amount of $1,020 (3
hours @ $340/hr) is granted against Defendant Pak alone (as the Notice of
Motion referred to Pak or his counsel) on the RFA Motion, to be paid to
Plaintiff within 20 days of the date of this order.       
            Plaintiff’s RFA Motion is
GRANTED.  The RFAs are deemed admitted as
to Defendant Pak absent service of substantially compliant responses under Section
2033.220 prior to the hearing date.  Pak is
ordered to pay sanctions on the RFA Motion in the amount of $1,020 to Plaintiff
within 20 days.
 
THE INTERROGATORY
MOTION
  CCP §2030.290
If
a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the following rules apply:
(a) The party to
whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise the option
to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the
interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on
motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both
of the following conditions are satisfied:
(1)
The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance
with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240.
(2)
The party's failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
(b) The party
propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to
the interrogatories.
(c) The court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then
fails to obey an order compelling answers, the court may make those orders that
are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction,
or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).
In lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).
 
Plaintiff is entitled
to responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) and Form Interrogatories (Set
One) without objection and sanctions.
            Plaintiff served Defendant Pak with Special
Interrogatories (Set One) and Form Interrogatories (Set One) (collectively, the
“Interrogatories”) on September 19, 2023. 
(Motion, Ex. A, Soto Dec., ¶5.) 
Defendant Pak failed to serve any responses thereto.  (Id. at ¶¶17-19.)  Defendant Pak has waived all objections per
CCP §2030.290(a) and is ordered to serve responses to the Interrogatories, without
objections, within 20 days.  
 
            Plaintiff requests sanctions in the
amount of $4,420 (13 hours @ $340/hr) against Defendant Pak or his counsel on
the Interrogatory Motion.  Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions on the Interrogatory Motion is GRANTED in the reasonable amount
of $1,020 (3 hours @ $340/hr) against Defendant Pak alone, to be paid to
Plaintiff within 20 days of the date of this order.              
 
            Plaintiff’s Interrogatory Motion is
GRANTED.  Defendant Pak is ordered to
serve responses to the Interrogatories without objection on Plaintiff within 20
days.  Defendant Pak is ordered to pay
sanctions to Plaintiff on the Interrogatory Motion in the amount of $1,020
within 20 days.  
 
THE DEPOSITION
MOTION
CCP §2025.450
            “If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or
employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party
under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section
2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce
for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move
for an order compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony, and the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”  (CCP §2025.450(a).)  A motion to compel attendance at deposition “shall
set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice.” 
(CCP §2025.450(b)(1).) 
Plaintiff is
entitled to an order compelling attendance of Defendant JJWV’s Person Most
Knowledgeable (“PMK”) at a deposition and production of documents in response
to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents (“RFPs”) contained in the
Notice of Deposition.
 
Plaintiff
served Defendant JJWV with a Notice of PMK Deposition on October 18, 2023 for a
deposition on November 3, 2023.  (Motion, Ex. A, Soto Dec., ¶5.)  Defendant JJWV did not serve
objections to the deposition notice, nor did it offer alternative dates when it
claimed it was unavailable for deposition on November 3, 2023.  (Id. at ¶¶11, 16-19.)  Defendant JJWV did not file an opposition to
the Deposition Motion, nor has it offered alternative dates for its PMK
deposition since the filing of the Deposition Motion.  
 
Plaintiff
also sets forth specific facts demonstrating good cause for production of
documents in response to the RFPs contained in the Notice of Deposition, as
required under CCP §2025.450(b)(1). 
(Motion, Ex. A, Soto Dec., ¶9.) 
The RFPs seek documents relating to Defendants’ alleged violations of FGC
sections 2118, 2125 and 8035 and 14 CCR §§671 and 671.1.  (Id. at ¶9.)
 
Plaintiff’s
request to compel the deposition of JJWV’s PMK is properly granted.  JJWV is ordered to attend deposition as set
by Plaintiff within 30 days and to produce documents in response to the RFPs
set forth in the Notice of Deposition served on October 18, 2023.  
 
            Plaintiff requests sanctions in the
amount of $5,440 (16 hours @ $340/hr) against Defendant JJWV or its
counsel.  Plaintiff’s request for
sanctions in the reasonable amount of $1,020 (3 hours @ $340/hr) on the
Deposition Motion is granted against Defendant Pak alone, to be paid to
Plaintiff within 20 days of the date of this order.  
 
            Plaintiff’s Deposition Motion is
GRANTED.  Defendant JJWV is ordered to
attend its deposition as set by Plaintiff within 30 days of the date of this
order.  Defendant JJWV and counsel are
ordered to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,020 to Plaintiff for the
Deposition Motion within 20 days of the date of this order.  
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
