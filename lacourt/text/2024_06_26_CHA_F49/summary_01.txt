And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Hyundai Motor America's motion to compel arbitration in a lawsuit filed by Mathew Anthony Reinoso over alleged defects in his 2022 Hyundai Palisade. The Judge found that Hyundai Motor America failed to demonstrate the existence of an arbitration agreement to which Reinoso agreed. The arbitration agreement was contained in the Owner's Handbook and Warranty Information, but Reinoso did not sign it. The Judge noted that Hyundai Motor America's argument that Reinoso should be estopped from repudiating the arbitration agreement was unpersuasive, citing a lack of evidence that Reinoso accepted the agreement. The Judge also found that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies to the agreement, but that Hyundai Motor America did not meet its burden to demonstrate the existence of an agreement to which Reinoso agreed.
