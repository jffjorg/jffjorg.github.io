Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has reviewed the petition for writ of mandate filed by Petitioners, who are seeking to address disproportionate disciplinary transfers of Black students with disabilities. The judge notes that the parties did not comply with the applicable local rules regarding the submission of opening and opposition briefs. The judge also finds that Petitioners' arguments are based on incomplete and inaccurate information, and that they have not proven illegal practices or policies by the District.

The judge concludes that the District's written policy conflicts with the Education Code, but that this conflict alone does not constitute a violation of the Education Code. The judge also finds that Petitioners have not proven that the District's policies and practices violate the Education Code, and that the court cannot compel the District to exercise its discretion in a specific way to address disproportionality in disciplinary transfers.
