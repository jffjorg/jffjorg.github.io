  Case Number:  20STCV31269    Hearing Date:   November 14, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On August 18, 2020, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Ruben Lara Marquez (“Defendant”)
and Does I-V for damages.  The complaint
demanded $25,592.42. 
 On February 8,
2021, Defendant filed an answer. 
On January 11, 2022, Plaintiff filed a stipulation for
entry of judgment in the event of default, which Defendant had signed. 
On February 1, 2022, the Court dismissed the case without
prejudice and retained jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure section
664.6. 
On September 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to set
aside the dismissal and to enter judgment against Defendant.  The motion was set for hearing on November 14,
2024.  Defendant has not filed an
opposition. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff asks the Court to set aside the dismissal and
enter judgment against Defendant under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides in part: 
“(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement. 
“(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed
by a party if it is signed by any of the following: 
“(1) The party. 
“(2) An attorney who represents the party. 
“(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is
authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer’s behalf.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6,
subds. (a), (b).) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
and Defendant stipulated that the Court would dismiss the action without
prejudice. In return, Defendant agreed to make specified monthly payments to
Plaintiff until Defendant paid the amount he owed Plaintiff. 
Defendant
has defaulted on his payment obligation. 
Plaintiff’s counsel sent a default payment letter to Defendant on July
29, 2024 advising Defendant that he was in default.  Defendant has failed to bring his payments
current. 
Because
Defendant did not cure the default, Plaintiff asks the Court to enter judgment
in Plaintiff’s favor for $18,642.97, consisting of $25,592.42, less payment
of $7,024.45, plus costs of $75.00.  The
Court grants the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company’s motion
to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment. 
The Court vacates the February 1, 2022 dismissal and awards Plaintiff
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company $18,642.97 against Defendant Ruben
Lara Marquez. 
Moving
