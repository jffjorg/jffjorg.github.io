And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the punitive damages claim against Wheels In Motion, Inc. will be struck from the complaint. The judge found that the complaint does not allege any additional facts that would support a finding that Wheels In Motion, Inc. engaged in "despicable conduct . . . with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others" as required by Civil Code section 3294. The judge also found that the complaint does not provide "specific factual allegations showing that [Wheels In Motion's] conduct was oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious" as required by the California Courts of Appeal in cases such as Today's IV, Inc. v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 1137. The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change after the parties have had an opportunity to file briefs and the judge has considered the arguments presented.
