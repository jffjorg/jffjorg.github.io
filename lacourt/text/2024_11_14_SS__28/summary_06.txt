The court has denied the motion, finding that the plaintiff's privacy interests in her cell phone outweigh the defendant's need for discovery of information contained in the cell phone. The court has also denied the defendant's request to compel the plaintiff to produce her cell phone number and to sign a release authorizing the defendant to obtain the plaintiff's cell phone records. The court has concluded that the plaintiff's privacy rights outweigh the defendant's need for discovery in this case.
