And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to deem cases related and to consolidate cases. The five actions involved are Adena Investment LLC v. Jose Prado, et al., LASC Case No. 24NNCV03026; Adena Investment LLC v. Francisco Hernandez, et al., LASC Case No. 24NNCV03024; Adena Investment LLC v. Esteban Chaco, et al., LASC Case No. 24NNCV03064; Adena Investment LLC v. Armando Torres, et al., LASC Case No. 24NNCV03082; and Adena Investment LLC v. Jaime Balderas, et al., LASC Case No. 24NNCV03097.

The judge finds that the cases are related because they involve the same parties, premises, and factual allegations, and that they arise from the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact. The judge also finds that consolidation of the cases would promote efficiency and economy, and that the defendants' failure to file an opposition brief may be deemed a consent to the granting of the motion.

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to relate and consolidate the five actions, and deems the Prado Action (LASC Case No. 24NNCV03026) as the lead case.
