Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Tesla Motors, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration against Plaintiff Dengcheng Yu. The plaintiff had purchased a 2023 Tesla Model Y with defects and filed a complaint alleging breach of express and implied warranties. The defendant moves to compel arbitration, citing the arbitration agreements in the Motor Vehicle Order Agreement and Retail Installment Sale Contract. The court finds that the arbitration agreement is not procedurally or substantively unconscionable, and that it does not affect the plaintiff's substantive right to seek relief under the Song-Beverly Act. The court also finds that the defendant did not waive its right to arbitration by failing to compel arbitration within 30 days of service of the complaint. The action will be stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration.
