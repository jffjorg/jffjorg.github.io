And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the petition to open a superior court file for the purpose of establishing superior court jurisdiction over an underinsured motorist arbitration matter. The petition was filed by Srbui Khorozyan and Sarkis Antonyan (Petitioners) against American Guarantee and Liability Insurance Company (Respondent) on May 24, 2024. Respondent filed a response on June 20, 2024, denying certain allegations and raising 36 affirmative defenses. The court notes that Respondent has not provided any legal authority to support its argument that the court should not take jurisdiction over the matter. The judge finds it appropriate to grant the petition, as Petitioners seek to compel arbitration, and Respondent has not presented evidence of the policy terms. The court orders that Petitioners provide notice of this order.
