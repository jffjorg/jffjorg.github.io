And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel the deposition of General Motors LLC's person most knowledgeable (PMK) in a case involving a defective 2021 Chevrolet Tahoe purchased by Nicole de Las Alas and Humble Haven RCFE LLC. The motion was filed by the plaintiffs, who are seeking to compel the deposition of the PMK to gather information about the vehicle's defects and the company's policies and procedures related to warranty claims.

The judge finds that the parties did not sufficiently meet and confer on the scope of discovery, which led to the filing of the motion. The judge grants the motion, but under certain conditions. Specifically, the parties are required to meet and confer at Defendant's attorneys' offices within 30 days to attempt to agree on the production of documents and topics of discovery. If this does not result in the completion of the PMK deposition, the parties can bring further motions.

The judge also orders that a PMK deposition be scheduled within 60 days and that the parties provide notice of this order. Finally, the judge declines to award sanctions to either party.
