 Case Number:  23BBCV015272    Hearing Date:   December 6, 2024    Dept:  NCB  
The Court has reviewed the petitions and finds the settlement fair and
reasonable. The parties have an agreement for attorney’s fees, but attorney’s
fees were not requested by counsel in connection with the two petitions for
minor’s compromise.  The petitions are
properly verified by Petitioner.  
 
The Court is inclined to grant the petitions provided that Petitioner
provide written assurances, verified by oath, that the total estate of each of
the minors, including the money or other property to be paid or delivered to
the parent, does not exceed $5,000 in value, pursuant to Probate Code, §§ 3401
and 3402.  
 
Per CRC Rule 7.952, Petitioner and the Claimant are required to attend
the hearing on the petition.  The Court
will therefore require attendance at the hearing in order to grant the
petition.  As an alternative to personal
appearance by the Guardian Ad Litem, the Court will accept a declaration signed
by the parents stating that the minors have fully recovered from any injury
they suffered in the incident as well as the written assurance required under
the Probate Code.
