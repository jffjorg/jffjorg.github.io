BACKGROUND
A.    Allegations in the
EC064805 Action

On December 8, 2015, Plaintiff Maria
Carmen Leal (“Leal”) filed an action against Nelly Dagstanyan, Mario
Haroutunian, and DOES 1-20, entitled Maria Carmen Leal v. Nelly Danstanyan,
LASC Case No. EC064805 (the “Leal Action”).
On September 1, 2016, Plaintiff Leal filed
a First Amended Complaint in the Leal Action against Defendants Nelly
Dagstanyan, Maro Haroutunian, Marika Bastrmajian, Khachig Mestchyan, and DOES
1-20. 
On June 22, 2018, Plaintiff Leal filed the
operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) in the Leal Action against
Defendants Nelly Dagstanyan, Grant Dagstanyan, Maro Haroutunian, Marika
Bastrmajian, Khachig Mestchyan,  Andranik
Aleksayan, Aresen Stepanyan, and DOES 1-20, alleging causes of action for: (1)
fraudulent transfer of real property under Uniform Voidable Transactions Act;
(2) fraudulent transfer of corporate property and assets under Uniform Voidable
Transactions Act; (3) constructive trust; (4) declaratory relief; (5)
declaratory relief; (6) tort of another; and (7) tort of another. 
In the Leal Action, Plaintiff Leal alleged
that she obtained a February 2014 judgment in LASC Case No. LS024960, which was
entered after Plaintiff Leal obtained an award for $66,756.57 in unpaid wages
against Nelly Dagstanyan and Sqwash Corporation on October 3, 2013. (SAC, ¶
23.) Plaintiff Leal alleged that Defendant Nelly Dagstanyan and her
codefendants engaged in a series of fraudulent conveyances of real property,
including real property located at 1317 N. Lamer St. in Burbank, CA, to avoid
enforcement of the judgment. (SAC, ¶ 33.) 
B.    
Allegations in the EC067628 Action
On November 30, 2017, Plaintiff Becharoff
Capital Corporation (“Becharoff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Grant H.
Dagstanyan, Nelly Dagstanyan, Maro Harotunian, Khachig A. Mestchyan, Marika
Bastrmajian, Andranik Aleksanyan, and DOES 1-20 in LASC Case No. EC067628
entitled Becharoff Capital Corporation v. Grant H. Dagstanyan, et al.
(the “Becharoff Action”). 
On May 10, 2021, Plaintiff Becharoff filed
the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants Grant H.
Dagstanyan, Nelly Dagstanyan, Maro Harotunian, Khachig A. Mestchyan, Marika
Bastrmajian, Andranik Aleksanyan, Aresen Stepanyan, and DOES 1-30, inclusive,
alleging causes of action for: (1) to set aside fraudulent conveyance; (2) to
set aside fraudulent conveyance; (3) common law fraudulent conveyance; (4)
conspiracy to commit fraudulent conveyance; (5) aiding and abetting fraudulent
conveyance; and (6) to quiet title to real property commonly known as 1317 N.
Lamer Street, Burbank, CA 91506. 
The operative FAC as to the Becharoff
Action alleges the following: on June 26, 2019, a judgment was entered for
$110,340.72 in LASC Case No. BC047457, entitled Bank of America, N.A. v.
Sav-On-Monolan, Inc., et al., and the judgment was entered in
favor of Bank of America, N.A. and jointly against Defendant Grant Dagstanyan
and Sav-On-Monolan, Inc. (the “Bank of America Judgment”). (FAC, ¶¶ 12, 13.) A
writ of execution was issued on August 26, 2009, in favor of the original
creditor, Bank of America. (FAC, ¶ 14.) An abstract of judgment was
subsequently issued on April 12, 2010, and recorded in Los Angeles County on
April 21, 2010. (FAC, ¶ 14.) On October 19, 2015, all right, title, and
interest in the Bank of America Judgment was assigned to Plaintiff Becharoff.
(FAC, ¶ 15.) On November 11, 2015, the assignment was filed, and Plaintiff
Becharoff became the assignee of record of the Bank of America Judgment,
entitled to enforce the Bank of America Judgment. (FAC, ¶ 15.) Such judgment
remains wholly unsatisfied. (FAC, ¶ 15.) Plaintiff Becharoff alleged that the
Dagstanyans engaged in a fraudulent transfer of real property, including the
property located at 1317 Lamer St. in Burbank, to avoid the Bank of America
Judgment. (FAC, ¶¶ 24, 32, 35.) 
C.    
Relevant Background 
On September 7, 2018, the Leal Action and
the Becharoff Action were related and consolidated for the purposes of being
tried together. The Leal Action was deemed the lead case. 
On May 4, 2021, after taking the matter
under submission, the Court denied Defendants Andranik Aleksanyan, Maro
Haroutunian, Grant Dagstanyan, and Nelly Dagstanyan’s motion for summary
judgment, or alternatively, summary adjudication. 
On May 11, 2021, non-jury trial commenced
in the Leal Action and the Becharoff Action, and Defendant Aresen Stephanyan
and all Doe defendants were dismissed with prejudice as to the FAC filed by
Plaintiff Becharoff on motion of the Court. 
On December 15, 2021, the Court issued its
final statement of decision. 
On February 15, 2022, the Court entered judgment
in both the Leal Action and the Becharoff Action. 
As to the SAC in the Leal Action, judgment
was entered as follows: Judgment was entered in favor of Plaintiff Leal and
against Defendants as to the first and sixth causes of action; judgment was
entered in favor of the Dagstanyans and Mestchyan on the second and fifth
causes of action; the seventh cause of action was entered in favor of
Mestchyan; the third cause of action was dismissed; and, as to the fourth cause
of action for declaratory relief, Plaintiff Leal did not request that the findings
in the Court’s statement of decision be included in the final judgment. 
As to the FAC in the Becharoff Action,
judgment was entered in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiff Becharoff. The
Court allowed Defendants to recover their costs of suit from Plaintiff
Becharoff. 
On April 18, 2022, Aleksanyan and the
Dagstanyans filed a motion for attorneys’ fees in which they sought prevailing
party attorneys’ fees in the sum of $203,202.00 from Plaintiff Becharoff. 
On August 15, 2022, after taking the
matter under submission, the Court granted the Dagstanyans and Aleksanyan’s
motion for attorneys’ fees against Plaintiff Becharoff in the amount of
$31,083.75. The Court indicated that “[i]n view of the history of fraudulent
conveyances by the Defendants, it is appropriate that Plaintiff Becharoff
Capital Corp. be permitted to set off that portion of the attorneys’ fees that
is attributable to Mr. Dagstanyan against the judgment that Plaintiff Becharoff
Capital Corp. has against him.” (08/15/22 Minute Order.) 
On August 23, 2022, Defendant Grant
Dagstanyan filed a notice of entry of judgment or order, which attached the
Court’s August 15, 2022 order thereto. 
On September 15, 2022, Defendant Grant
Dagstanyan filed a notice of appeal, which indicated that he was appealing the
Court’s August 15, 2022 order. 
On December 22, 2022, the appeal filed by
Defendant Grant Dagstanyan on September 15, 2022 was dismissed due to such
defendant being in default. 
On January 20, 2023, the Second District
Court of Appeal, vacated the order of dismissal entered on December 22, 2022,
and reinstated Defendant Grant Dagstanyan’s September 15, 2022 appeal. 
On September 18, 2024, the Second District
Court of Appeal issued remittitur, in which the Second District Court of Appeal
affirmed this Court’s August 15, 2022 order. The Second District Court of
Appeal found that Defendants did not meet their burden in showing that the
Court abused its discretion in reducing the number of requested hours or hourly
rates. Further, the Second District Court of Appeal found that the Defendants
did not meet their burden in showing that the Court erred when it ordered the
fee award to be offset against an earlier judgment. The Second District Court
of Appeal opinion provides that Plaintiff Becharoff is awarded costs on appeal.

D.   
Motion on Calendar 
On September 30, 2024, Plaintiff Becharoff
filed a motion for attorneys’ fees and costs on appeal. Plaintiff Becharoff
seeks attorneys’ fees against Defendant Grant Dagstanyan in the sum of
$31,995.00.   
On November 26, 2024, Defendants
Aleksanyan, Grant Dagstanyan, and Nelly Dagstanyan (“Defendants”) filed an
opposition to the motion.
On November 27, 2024, Plaintiff Becharoff
filed a reply brief. 
Although filed and served late, the Court
will consider the opposition brief. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1300(d).) 
DISCUSSION
A.    Entitlement to Attorneys’
Fees 
            Plaintiff
Becharoff contends that it is entitled to attorneys’ fees because the Second
District Court of Appeal affirmed this Court’s ruling concerning Defendants’
motion for attorneys’ fees. Defendants argue that Plaintiff Becharoff is not
entitled to attorneys’ fees and costs because, in opposition to Defendants’
motion for attorneys’ fees, Plaintiff Becharoff argued that attorneys’ fees are
not recoverable.  
Civ. Code § 1717
provides that “[i]n any action on a contract, where the contract specifically
provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that
contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing
party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the
contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not,
shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees in addition to other costs.”
(Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a).) “[A] prevailing party is entitled as a matter
of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.” (Santisas v. Goodin (1998)
17 Cal.4th 599, 606.) “[A]ttorney fees are allowable as costs . . . when they
are authorized by either [c]ontract, [s]tatute, or [l]aw.” (Ibid.)
“[R]ecoverable litigation costs do include attorney fees, but only when the
party entitled to costs has a legal basis, independent of the costs statutes
and grounded in an agreement, statute, or other law, upon which to claim
recovery of attorney fees.” (Ibid.) 
“The mutuality of remedy doctrine is typically used in cases in which a
party establishes that it is either not a party to a contract, or that the
contract it is a party to is void or unenforceable.” (Eden Township
Healthcare Dist. v. Eden Medical Center (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 418, 429 (Eden
Township).) “Under that doctrine, if the party would have been exposed to
fees had the court found against it, then that party is entitled to fees for
prevailing.” (Ibid.) 
Here, Plaintiff Becharoff seeks the attorneys’ fees it incurred on appeal
in defending itself against Defendants’ appeal of this Court’s August 15, 2022
order. The Court references its August 15, 2022 order on Defendants’ motion for
attorneys’ fees. The Court stated therein that “[t]he BOFA contract would have
allowed Becharoff—had it prevailed on this action—to collect fees from Mr.
Dagstanyan. Thus, applying the mutuality of remedy in section 1717 would allow
Mr. Dagstanyan to recover attorney’s fees against Becharoff if they prevailed.”
(08/15/22 Order at p. 4:13-16.) The Court found that “[b]y assigning the BOFA
Judgment to Becharoff, all rights, title, and interest in the judgment was
assigned to Becharoff, including Becharoff’s right to enforce the BOFA Judgment
against Mr. Dagstanyan. Hence, if BOFA would have been entitled to recover
attorney’s fees from Mr. Dagstanyan in this action, then Becharoff too would be
able to seek fees. Conversely, applying the mutuality of remedies, Mr.
Dagstanyan would be able to recover fees from Becharoff if Mr. Dagstanyan
prevailed.” (Id. at p. 5:7-12.) Thus, the Court found that “only Mr.
Dagstanyan was a signatory to the BOFA contract, such that only Mr. Dagstanyan
is entitled to recover fees pursuant to Civil Code, § 1717. As such, Mr.
Dagstanyan has established his entitlement to attorney’s fees against
Becharoff.” (Id. at p. 5:19-22.) 
The Court finds that although Plaintiff Becharoff did not prevail on the
FAC as judgment was entered in favor of Defendants, Plaintiff Becharoff did
prevail on the appeal filed by Defendants. Had Defendants prevailed on appeal,
it follows that they would have been entitled to attorneys’ fees incurred on
appeal pursuant to Eden Township, supra, 220 Cal.App.4th 418,
429. Given that the Second District Court of Appeal affirmed this Court’s
August 15, 2022 order as to Defendants’ motion for attorneys’ fees, the Court
finds that Plaintiff Becharoff is entitled to its attorneys’ fees in opposing Defendants’
appeal of this Court’s August 15, 2022 order. 
Thus, Plaintiff
Becharoff is entitled to attorneys’ fees incurred on appeal under the mutuality
of remedy doctrine.   
B.    
Reasonableness of Attorneys’ Fees 
“It is well established that the determination of what constitutes
reasonable attorney fees is committed to the discretion of the trial court,
whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence of an abuse of discretion.” (Melnyk
v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623.) The fee setting inquiry in
California ordinarily “begins with the ‘lodestar’ [method], i.e., the number of
hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (Graciano
v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.) “The
reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.” (Margolin
v. Regional Planning Com. (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004.) Where a party
is challenging the reasonableness of attorney’s fees as excessive that party
must attack itemized billing with evidence that the fees claimed were not
appropriate or obtain the declaration of an attorney with expertise in the
procedural and substantive law to demonstrate that the fees claimed were
unreasonable.  (Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008)
163 Cal.App.4th 550, 563-564.)  “[I]t is
the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific items challenged,
with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence and arguments that fees claimed are excessive,
duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.” (Id.
at p. 564.)  It is well established that
the determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to
the discretion of the trial court.  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1096.)  
Plaintiff Becharoff presents the declaration of its counsel, Lance A.
Brewer (“Brewer”), in support of the instant motion. Mr. Brewer attests that he
has been an attorney since December of 1986 and has extensive experience in all
facets of litigation practice, including all aspects of law and motion matters.
(Brewer Decl., ¶ 3.) Mr. Brewer attests to the reasonableness of the time spent
in defending the appeal as well as his hourly rate of $450.00 per hour. (Brewer
Decl., ¶ 4.) Mr. Brewer spent 71.1 hours in connection with defending Plaintiff
Becharoff on appeal. (Brewer Decl., ¶ 4.) Mr. Brewer has provided the Court
with billing records. (Brewer Decl., ¶ 4; Ex. A.) 
Although Defendants take issue with the reasonableness of the claimed fees,
Defendants have presented no evidence as to the unreasonableness of the
requested attorneys’ fees. Mr. Brewer has attested that all the hours spent
were reasonable and justified in defense of the appeal. Mr. Brewer has also
attested to the reasonableness of his hourly rate. 
However, upon review of the billing records, the Court finds that Plaintiff
Becharoff has presented numerous billing entries which are block-billed.
(Brewer Decl., Ex. A.) “Block billing occurs when a block of time [is assigned]
to multiple tasks rather than itemizing the time spent on each task.” (Mountjoy
v. Bank of America, N.A. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 266, 279.) Out of the 19
entries on the billing records presented to the Court, 13 of those entries are
block billed. Only the January 15, January 22, June 12, July 21, August 23, and
November 17, 2023, entries are not block billed. (Brewer Decl., Ex. A.) 
The Court therefore exercises its discretion and will discount Plaintiff
Becharoff’s fee request due to the pervasiveness of block billing. (Jaramillo
v. County of Orange (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 811, 830 (“block billing is not
objectionable per se, though it certainly does increase the risk that the trial
court, in a reasonable exercise of its discretion, will discount a fee
request.”).) The Court will reduce the hourly rate of Mr. Brewer from $450 per
hour to $400 per hour due to the block billing. 
Thus, taking into account these adjustments, the Court will award a total
of $28,440.00 in attorneys’ fees (= 71.1 hours x $400/hour).  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
            Plaintiff
Becharoff Capital Corporation’s motion for attorneys’ fees and costs on appeal
is granted in the amount of $28,440.00.   
            Plaintiff Becharoff shall provide
notice of this order.
