And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge John J. Kralik issued a tentative ruling on December 6, 2024, in a lemon law action lawsuit filed by Francisco Roman Cervantes against Ford Motor Company. The lawsuit alleges that the 2021 Ford Explorer purchased by Cervantes was delivered with serious defects and nonconformities, and that Ford failed to conform the vehicle to the applicable warranty despite a reasonable number of repair attempts.

Cervantes filed a motion to compel Ford to produce further responses to a request for production of documents, but Ford argued that the motion was substantively moot because Cervantes failed to meet and confer in good faith. The court disagreed, finding that Cervantes failed to set forth specific facts justifying the court to compel further responses to each of the objected discovery responses.

The court denied Cervantes' motion to compel further responses to Ford's production of documents, but did not award any monetary sanctions to Ford. The court found that Ford's request for sanctions was not warranted because Ford did not provide evidence of the supplemental responses it purportedly agreed to produce subject to a protective order. The court also noted that Cervantes did not misuse the discovery process by failing to withdraw the instant motion as Ford had not provided the responses justifying the motion.
