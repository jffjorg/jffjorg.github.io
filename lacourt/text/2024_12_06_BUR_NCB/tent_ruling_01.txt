motion to continue trial date
 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations
On December 19, 2022, Plaintiff Martha
Burrola (“Plaintiff” or “Burrola”) filed an action against Defendants The Vons
Companies, Inc. (“Vons”) (erroneously sued as “Albertsons Companies, Inc, dba
Pavilions”), the Decurion Corporation (“Decurion”), and Does 1 through 10, for
negligence and premises liability. 
Plaintiff alleges that on December 23, 2020, as she was exiting a
Pavilions grocery store, she walked across a clear liquid substance at the
entrance and exit door and on the adjacent parking area and painted
crosswalk.  She alleges that there was no
warning that the area was wet or slippery. 
As a result, she slipped and fell as she was walking towards her
car.  She also alleges that the store
premises was owned, operated, leased, rented, maintained, and/or managed by
Defendant Vons, and the premises/common areas were owned, operated, leased,
rented, maintained, and/or managed by Defendant Decurion.
 
On
June 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed an amendment correcting Defendant’s name from
“Albertsons Companies, Inc. dba Pavilions” to “The Vons Companies.”  Following a stipulation by the parties,
Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Vons, Decurion, and
Does 1 through 10, on June 28, 2023.  On
August 3 and October 17, 2023, Plaintiff amended the FAC, to add Defendant
Rancho Marketplace Gateway, LLC (“RMG”) as Doe 6, Defendant Decurion Management
Company (“Decurion Management”) as Doe 8, and Defendant Robertson Properties
Group (“Robertson”) as Doe 7.
B.     Cross-Complaints
On
March 23, 2023, Defendant Vons filed an Answer; on August 16, 2023, the Answer
was accepted as the Answer to the FAC. 
On April 11, 2023, Vons filed a Cross-Complaint against RMG and Roes 1
through 10 for (1) breach of contract, (2) express and implied indemnity, (3)
contribution and apportionment, and (4) declaratory relief.
RMG
filed an Answer to the Cross-Complaint on July 13, 2023, and a Cross-Complaint
against Moes 1 through 25 for (1) equitable indemnity, (2)
contribution/apportionment of fault, (3) declaratory relief, (4) breach of
contract, and (5) express indemnity.  On
May 10, 2024, RMG added Vons as Moe 1. 
On June 20, 2024, Vons filed an Answer to RMG’s Cross-Complaint.
On
July 18, 2023, Decurion filed an Answer to the FAC and a Cross-Complaint
against Foes 1 through 25 for (1) equitable indemnity, (2)
contribution/apportionment of fault, (3) declaratory relief, (4) breach of
contract, and (5) express indemnity.
On
April 5, 2024, RMG filed an Answer to the FAC.
C.     Relevant
Background
On
April 9, 2024, pursuant to the stipulation of the parties, the Court continued
the trial date from May 28 to August 26, 2024. 
On July 16, 2024, pursuant to another stipulation of the parties, the
Court continued the trial date from August 26 to November 25, 2024.  On October 10, 2024, pursuant to the
stipulation by the parties, the Court again continued the trial date from
November 25, 2024, to February 24, 2025.
On
July 26, 2024, the Court granted Defendant Decurion’s Motion for Summary
Judgment as to Plaintiff Burrola’s FAC and dismissed Defendant Decurion from
the FAC with prejudice.  Pursuant to
Decurion’s request, the Court also dismissed the Cross-Complaint against Foes 1
through 25 without prejudice.
D.   
Motions on Calendar
On November 6, 2024, Defendant Vons filed
a Motion for Summary Judgment of the FAC, set for hearing on February 28,
2025.  To date, no opposition has been
filed.
On November 8,
2024, Defendant Vons filed the instant Motion to Continue Trial Date
(“Motion”).  On November 27, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a Response to the Motion.  The Court is not in receipt of a reply brief. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Although continuances of trials are
disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own
merits.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(c).)  The court may grant a
continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the
continuance.  (Ibid.)  Good cause includes the unavailability of an
essential lay or expert witness, party, or trial counsel; “the substitution of
trial counsel, but only where there is an affirmative showing that the
substitution is required in the interests of justice;” the addition of a new
party; a party’s excused inability to obtain evidence; or a significant,
unanticipated change in the case.  (Ibid.)
Furthermore, the court may look to the
following factors in determining whether a trial continuance is warranted:
(1) The proximity of the trial date;
(2) Whether there was any previous
continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party;
(3) The length of the continuance
requested;
(4) The availability of alternative means
to address the problem that gave rise to the motion or application for a
continuance;
(5) The prejudice that parties or
witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;
(6) If the case is entitled to a
preferential trial setting, the reasons for that status and whether the need
for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay;
(7) The court's calendar and the impact of
granting a continuance on other pending trials;
(8) Whether trial counsel is engaged in
another trial;
(9) Whether all parties have stipulated to
a continuance;
(10) Whether the interests of justice are
best served by a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by imposing
conditions on the continuance; and
(11) Any other fact or circumstance
relevant to the fair determination of the motion or application.
(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d)(1)-(11).)
Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050
allows a court to grant leave to complete discovery proceedings.  In doing so, a court shall consider matters
relevant to the leave requested, including, but not limited to: (1) the
necessity of the discovery, (2) the diligence in seeking the discovery or
discovery motion, (3) the likelihood of interference with the trial calendar or
prejudice to a party, and (4) the length of time that has elapsed between
previous trial dates.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2024.050.)
DISCUSSION
            Defendant
Vons moves for an order continuing the trial date to March 28, 2025, to enable
the Court to proceed with the February 28, 2025, hearing on its Motion for
Summary Judgment (“MSJ”).
            Vons
states that it filed an Answer to Plaintiff’s Complaint on March 23, 2023, and
has been diligently conducting discovery since then.  After completing the depositions of
co-Defendant RMG’s Person Most Knowledgeable on July 19, 2024, and Vons
employee Helen Huggins, on October 22, 2024, Defendant found that the evidence
supports summary judgment of the FAC. 
Defendant proceeded to file the MSJ on November 6, 2024, and reserved
the first available hearing date on February 28, 2025.  Given that the current trial date is set for
February 24, 2025, Vons is seeking a continuance of the trial date to allow the
MSJ to be heard at least 30 days prior to trial pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c.  Defendant Vons
argues that there is good cause to continue the trial date as it has been
diligently engaged in discovery to investigate the matter and to show that
co-Defendant RMG owned, maintained, and controlled the area where the incident
occurred.
            In
response, Plaintiff Burrola requests that any trial continuance not exceed 60
days from the MSJ hearing date.  Plaintiff states that there have been several prior
continuances, and a continuance of less than 60 days will allow the parties
sufficient time to conduct a private mediation after the hearing on the MSJ.
            Although
there have been several continuances granted in the instant case, the Court finds
that there is good cause to grant a brief continuance to allow the Court to
proceed with the MSJ hearing set for February 28, 2025.  Moreover, Plaintiff does not oppose a brief
continuance for this purpose. 
Accordingly, the Court grants Defendant Vons’s Motion to Continue Trial
Date.
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Defendant
The Vons Companies, Inc.’s Motion to Continue Trial Date is GRANTED.  Trial, currently scheduled for February 24,
2025, is hereby vacated and re-set as follows. 
Trial is set for Apri1, 2025, at 9:30 a.m.  A Final Status Conference is set for March
20, 2025, at 9:00 a.m.  All related
pre-trial dates and deadlines, including all discovery and statutory dates and
deadlines, shall be governed by the new trial date.
Defendant shall provide notice of this
order.
