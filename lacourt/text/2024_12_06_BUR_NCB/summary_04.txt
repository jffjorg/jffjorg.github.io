And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petitions and determined that the settlement is fair and reasonable. The parties have an agreement on attorney's fees, but this is not applicable to the minor's compromise petitions. The court finds that the petitions are properly verified by the petitioner. To grant the petitions, the court requires the petitioner to provide written assurances, verified by oath, that the total estate of each minor does not exceed $5,000 in value. The court also requires the petitioner and claimant to attend the hearing, which can be done in person or through a declaration from the parents stating that the minors have fully recovered from any injuries and providing the required written assurance.
