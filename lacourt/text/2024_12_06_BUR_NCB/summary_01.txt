Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is in response to Defendant Vons' Motion to Continue Trial Date, which seeks to continue the trial date to March 28, 2025, to allow the Court to proceed with the February 28, 2025, hearing on its Motion for Summary Judgment. The Court finds that there is good cause to grant a brief continuance, as Defendant Vons has been diligently conducting discovery and has found that the evidence supports summary judgment of the FAC. The Court grants Defendant Vons' Motion to Continue Trial Date, vacating the current trial date of February 24, 2025, and resetting the trial date for April 1, 2025. A Final Status Conference is set for March 20, 2025, at 9:00 a.m.
