And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting defendant Ernest Morales' motion to strike portions of plaintiff Adriana Alvarado's complaint seeking punitive damages. The judge finds that the allegations in the complaint are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages under California law. Specifically, the allegations of intoxication are made "on information and belief" and lack specific details, and there are no other instances of intoxicated driving or specific facts to support the allegation. The judge notes that even if the allegations were proved at trial, they may not be sufficient to support a finding of "malice" or "conscious disregard of safety" under California law. The judge grants the motion to strike with 20 days leave to amend.
