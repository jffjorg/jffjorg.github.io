  Hearing Date:  December 6, 2024
 
 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motion to be relieved as counsel
 



 
Plaintiff’s counsel, Lillian Sedaghat(“Counsel”),
moves to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Neffertashia Ann Burroughs (“Plaintiff”).  
Counsel filed this instant motion to be
relieved as counsel on October 29, 2024.  Counsel has filed the requisite forms pursuant
to CRC Rule 3.1362.  
According to the declaration of Counsel,
Counsel seeks to be relieved as counsel because there has been an irretrievable
breakdown of the attorney-client relationship and Plaintiff is unresponsive.  (MC-052, §2.)  For these reasons, Counsel seeks to withdraw
from representing Plaintiff in this action. 

Counsel properly served Plaintiff at her
last known mailing address, which was confirmed by mail, return receipt
requested, within the past 30 days of filing the motion.  Counsel also states that she has been unable
to confirm whether the address is current or locate a more current address
after having mailed the motion papers to Plaintiff at her last known address,
return receipt requested.  (Defendant has
not yet been served with the summons and complaint.)  
As for future hearing dates, a Case
Management Conference is set for March 26, 2025.  Thus, there is sufficient time for Plaintiff
to obtain substitute counsel. 
Accordingly, the motion to be relieved as
counsel is granted.  The order electronically
lodged by Counsel will be signed at the hearing.  The order will become effective upon the
filing of a proof of service of a signed copy of the order on Plaintiff.  
Notice to be provided by Counsel.
