And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on a civil action brought by Harris under the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA). The case concerns the application of Labor Code § 2699, which was recently amended on July 1, 2024. The judge notes that the pre-amendment version of the statute applies to this case, given the pre-amendment filing date of the initial complaint and related administrative exhaustion letter.

The judge is seeking to clarify the application of Labor Code § 2699 and determine the applicable penalty for PAGA violations. Specifically, the judge is considering the meaning of "subsequent" penalty under PAGA, which has been interpreted by various courts to apply only after a court or the Labor Commissioner determines a violation.

The judge cites to several cases, including Gunther v. Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Bernstein v. Virgin Am., Inc., to support their interpretation of the law. The judge's tentative ruling aims to provide guidance on the application of Labor Code § 2699 and ensure fair and consistent enforcement of the law.
