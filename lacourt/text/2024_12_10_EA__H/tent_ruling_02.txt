[FN1] Labor Code § 2699 was recently amended
on July 1, 2024. Subdivision (m) now provides for a distribution of 65% (rather
than a 75% distribution) paid to the LWDA. The Court cites to the pre-amendment
version of the statute, which applies here based on the pre-amendment filing
date of the initial complaint and related administrative exhaustion letter.
(See Lab. Code § 2699(v) [“(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the amendments made
to this section by the act adding this subdivision shall apply to a civil
action brought on or after June 19, 2024. (2) The amendments made to this
section by the act adding this subdivision shall not apply to a civil action
with respect to which the notice required by subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1)
of subdivision (a), paragraph (1) of subdivision (b), or subparagraph (A)
of paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 2699.3 was filed before June 19,
2024.” 


[FN2] Harris cites to pre-amendment
Labor Code § 2699(f)(2), which provides that “[i]f, at the time of the alleged
violation, the person employs one or more employees, the civil penalty is one
hundred dollars ($100) for each aggrieved employee per pay period for the
initial violation and two hundred dollars ($200) for each aggrieved employee
per pay period for each subsequent violation,” but notes that “a number of
courts have found that the ‘subsequent’ penalty under PAGA applies only after a
court or the Labor Commissioner determines that the employer has violated the
Labor Code” (Motion, 12:11-12), citing Gunther v. Alaska Airlines, Inc.
(2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 334, 3256 and Bernstein v. Virgin Am., Inc. (9th
Cir. 2021) 990 F.3d 1157, 1173, amended and superseded on denial of rehearing
en banc by Bernstein v. Virgin America, Inc. (9th Cir. 2021) 3 F.4th
1127).)
