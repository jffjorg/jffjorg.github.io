 Case Number:  24PSCV00081    Hearing Date:   December 10, 2024    Dept:  H Interpool, Inc.
v. Yun Long Trucking Inc., et al. (24PSCV00081)


Plaintiff Interpool, Inc. dba Trac Intermodal’s
Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.

Background  

Plaintiff Interpool, Inc. dba Trac Intermodal (“Plaintiff”) alleges that after
leasing chassis to Yun Long Trucking Inc. (“Yun Long”) and SFO Merchandise Inc.
(“SFO”), both of which are controlled by Bingze Li (“Li”) (together,
“Defendants”), Defendants failed to remit payment to Plaintiff and failed to
return the chassis.
On January 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting five
causes of action against Defendants and Does 1-20, including for common counts
and possession of personal property of damages.
On August 19, 2024, the Clerk entered default against Defendants.
Pending before the Court is Plaintiff’s Application for
Default Judgment.
 
Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied
without prejudice. The following defects are noted:
          On August 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
declaration from custodian of records  Karen
W. Wolcott (“Wolcott”) (executed on July 24, 2024) in support of its earlier
default prove-up application. Wolcott attested therein that Plaintiff’s
statement of account as to SFO indicated a balance of $48,735.00. (Wolcott
7/24/24 Decl., 3:2-3). Wolcott now attests, in her declaration executed on
October 18, 2024, that the statement of account as to SFO is $192,813.61.
(Wolcott 10/18/24 Decl., 2:23). The Court requests that Plaintiff explain this
discrepancy.

Accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiff’s application without prejudice
and directs Plaintiff to submit a new default judgment application that
addresses the aforementioned defects. Plaintiff’s
counsel is directed to resubmit a full and complete default prove-up
application. The Court will not entertain any piecemeal submissions.
