v. Pocino Foods Company, Case No. 23PSCV02840
 
ORDER ON MOTION FOR APPROVAL OF PAGA SETTLEMENT


Plaintiff
Warren Harris’ Motion for Court Approval of the Parties’ PAGA Settlement is GRANTED.

 
I.        Background 
Plaintiff
Warren Harris (“Harris” or “Plaintiff”) brings this Private Attorneys General
Act (“PAGA”) action in a representative capacity only and on behalf of other
members of the general public similarly situated.  Harris alleges that he was employed by Pocino
Foods Company (“Defendant”) from on or about June 1, 2020 through March 10,
2023. Harris alleges Defendant violated various Labor Code provisions by
failing to provide uninterrupted meal and rest periods, to pay overtime wages,
to pay wages for all hours worked, to pay all wages due at separation of
employment, to reimburse for all necessary business-related expenses, and to
provide accurate wage statements. 
On
September 14, 2023, Harris filed a complaint, asserting causes of action
against Defendant and Does 1-10 for: (1) Meal and Rest Period Violations
Pursuant to Labor Code § 2698 et seq., (2) Minimum Wage Violations Pursuant to
Labor Code § 2698 et seq., (3) Overtime Violations Pursuant to Labor Code §
2698 et seq., (4) Wage Statement Violations Pursuant to Labor Code § 2698 et
seq., (5) Failure to Reimburse Pursuant to Labor Code § 2698 et seq., and (6)    Failure to Pay Wages Upon Separation
Pursuant to Labor Code § 2698 et seq. 
Pending
before the Court is Plaintiff’s motion for approval of the parties’ PAGA settlement.
For the reasons stated herein, the motion is granted.


II.      Legal Standard
Labor
Code § 2699, subdivision (l)(2) states: “The superior court shall review and
approve any settlement of any civil action filed pursuant to this part [Labor
Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (“PAGA”)].  The proposed settlement shall be submitted to
the [Labor and Workforce Development Agency (“LWDA”)] at the same time that it
is submitted to the court.”[FN1] 
Any
settlement of any civil action filed under PAGA must be “fair and adequate in
view of the purposes and policies of the statute.”  (O’Connor
v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (N.D. Cal. 2016) 201 F.Supp.3d 1110, 1135.)
Seventy-five percent of all PAGA
penalties must be paid to the LWDA. (Lab. Code § 2699(i)). Further, reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs are awarded to a prevailing employee. (Lab. Code §
2699(g)(1).) 

III.     Discussion 
Harris
requests entry of an order granting of the parties’ “PAGA Settlement Agreement”
(the “Agreement”).
A.       Terms
of the Settlement Agreement 
The
Agreement is attached as Exhibit 1 to the Declaration of Eric K. Yaeckel (“Yaeckel”).
Citations herein are to provisions of the Agreement unless otherwise noted. The
essential terms of the Agreement are as follows:
Definition of Aggrieved Employees: “Aggrieved Employees” means “a person employed by Pocino in
California and classified as a non-exempt, hourly-paid employee who worked for
Pocino during the PAGA Period.” (Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.4.)
Definition of PAGA Period: “PAGA Period” means “the period from July 11, 2022 to June
30, 2024.” (Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.19.)
Definition of PAGA Pay Period: “PAGA Pay Period” means “any Pay Period during which an
Aggrieved Employee worked for Pocino for at least one day during the PAGA
Period.” (Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.18.)
Definition of Gross Settlement Amount
(“GSA”): The GSA is a
non-reversionary $350,000.00 (Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.10), which includes the
following:
          Individual
PAGA Payments: The “Individual PAGA
Payment” is the “Aggrieved Employee’s pro rata share of 25% of the PAGA
Penalties (approximately $52,444.25) calculated according to the number of Pay
Periods the Aggrieved Employee worked during the PAGA Period.” (Agreement, Section
1, ¶ 1.11 and Section 3, ¶ 3.2.4; Motion, 8:1.) Aggrieved Employees
assume full responsibility and liability for any taxes owed on their Individual
PAGA Payment. (Agreement, Section 3, ¶
3.2.4.) Administrator (defined below) will report the Individual PAGA Payments
on IRS 1099 Forms. (Agreement, Section 3, ¶ 3.2.4.2.) Pocino estimates there
are approximately 234 Aggrieved Employees who worked a total of approximately
14,500 PAGA Pay Periods. (Agreement, Section 4, ¶ 4.1.)
          Calculation:
Each Individual PAGA Payment will be calculated by Administrator (defined below) dividing the
amount of the Aggrieved Employees’ 25% share of PAGA Penalties by the total
number of PAGA Pay Periods worked by all Aggrieved Employees during the PAGA
Period and multiplying the result by each Aggrieved Employee’s PAGA Period Pay
Periods. (Agreement, Section 3, ¶ 3.2.4.1.)   
          LWDA PAGA Payment: Seventy-five
percent (75%) of the PAGA Penalties (approximately $157,332.74) will be
distributed to the LDWA. (Agreement Section
1, ¶ 1.14 and Section 3, ¶ 3.2.4; Motion, 7:22.) 
          PAGA Counsel Fees and Litigation
Expenses Payments: Attorney’s fees
to be paid to Plaintiff’s counsel are not to exceed 33.33% of the GSA (i.e., $116,550.00).
(Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.17 and Section 3, ¶ 3.2.1.) Costs are $10,173.01.
(Id.; Motion, 8:13.) 
          Plaintiff’s
Service Award: Harris will receive
a service payment of not more than $10,000.00, in addition to any
Individual PAGA Payment to which Harris is entitled. (Agreement, Section 3, ¶
3.2.2.) Administrator (defined below) will pay this amount using IRS
Form 1099 and Plaintiff assumes responsibility for employee taxes owed on this
payment. (Id.) 
          Administrator’s
Expenses Payment: Settlement administration fees are not to exceed $3,500.00
(Agreement, Section 3, ¶ 3.2.3.)
Definition of Net Settlement
Amount (“NSA”): The NSA is the GSA,
less the PAGA Counsel Fees and Litigation Expenses Payments, Plaintiff’s
Service Award, and the Administrator’s Expenses Payment. (Agreement, Section 1,
¶ 1.15.) The remainder is to be paid to the Individual PAGA Payments (25%) and
the LWDA PAGA Payment (75%). (Id.)
Claims Process: There is no claims process.
Settlement Administrator: ILYM Group, Inc. (“ILYM”) is
the third-party settlement administrator. (Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.2.) Within
30 days after the “Effective Date” (i.e., the “date by when both of the
following have occurred: (a) the Court enters a Judgment on its Order Approving
the PAGA Settlement and (b) the Judgment is final. The Judgment is final as of
the day the Court enters Judgment”), Pocino will deliver the Aggrieved Employee
Data (i.e., “identifying information in Pocino’s possession including the
Aggrieved Employee’s name, last-known mailing address, Social Security number
and number of PAGA Pay Periods”) to, and fully fund the GSA by transmitting the
funds to, Administrator. (Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.9 and Section 4, ¶¶ 4.2 and
4.3.) Within 14 days after Pocino funds the GSA, Administrator will mail checks
for all Individual PAGA Payments, the LWDA PAGA Payment, and the PAGA Counsel and
Administration Expenses Payments. (Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.5 and Section 4, ¶
4.4.) 
Administrator
will issue checks for the Individual PAGA Payments and send them to the
Aggrieved Employees via First Class U.S. Mail, postage prepaid. (Agreement, Section
4, ¶ 4.4.1.) Before mailing any checks, Administrator will update the
recipients’ mailing addresses using the National Change of Address Database. (Id.)
Within 7 days of receiving a returned check, Administrator must re-mail checks
to the USPS forwarding address provided or to an address ascertained through
the Aggrieved Employee Address Search (i.e., made by “using all reasonably
available sources, methods and means including, but not limited to, the
National Change of Address database, skip traces and direct contact by . . .
Administrator with Aggrieved Employees”). (Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.6 and
Section 4, ¶ 4.4.2.) Administrator need not take further steps to deliver
checks to Aggrieved Employees whose re-mailed checks are returned as
undelivered. (Agreement, Section 4, ¶ 4.4.2.)
Uncashed Funds: The face of each check shall prominently state the date
(not less than 180 days after the date of mailing) when the check will be
voided. (Agreement, Section 4, ¶ 4.4.1.) Administrator will promptly send a
replacement check to any Aggrieved Employee whose original check was lost or
misplaced, requested by the Aggrieved Employee prior to the void date. (Agreement,
Section 4, ¶ 4.4.2.) 
Administrator
will cancel all checks not cashed by the void date. (Id.) Any uncashed
check canceled after the void date will be transmitted by Administrator to The
Justice Gap Fund maintained by The State Bar of California. (Agreement, Section
4, ¶ 4.4.3.)
Notice to LWDA: Concurrently with this motion, Harris provided a copy of
the Agreement to the LWDA. (See “Notice Re Submission of the Settlement
Agreement to the LWDA”).
Release: “Released PAGA Claims” means “all claims for PAGA penalties that were alleged, or
reasonably could have been alleged, based on the PAGA Period facts stated in
the Operative Complaint[,] the PAGA Notice, including claims for PAGA penalties
premised on: (1) meal and rest period violations, (2) minimum wage violations,
(3) overtime violations, (4) wage statement violations, (5) failure to
reimburse business expenses, and (6) failure to pay wages upon separation.” (Agreement,
Section 1, ¶ 1.25 and Section 5, ¶ 5.2.) 
“Released
Parties” means “Pocino and each of its former and present directors, officers,
shareholders, owners, members, attorneys, insurers, predecessors, successors,
assigns, subsidiaries, agents, and affiliates.” (Agreement, Section 1, ¶ 1.26.) 
 
B.       Fairness
and Adequacy of Settlement 
“Despite
the fact that a representative action under PAGA is not a class action and is
instead a type of qui tam action, a standard requiring the trial court to
determine independently whether a PAGA settlement is fair and reasonable is
appropriate.” (Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc. (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 56, 76
[internal quotations and citations omitted].) “[A] trial court should evaluate a
PAGA settlement to determine whether it is fair, reasonable, and adequate in
view of PAGA’s purposes to remediate present labor law violations, deter future
ones, and to maximize enforcement of state labor laws. (Id. at 77.)
 
          Arm’s
Length Bargaining Process 
On
April 23, 2024, the parties participated in a full-day mediation conducted by
with the Honorable Herbert Hoffman (Ret.) (“Hoffman”), “an experienced mediator
of wage and hour actions” who “helped to manage the Parties’ expectations and
provided a useful, neutral analysis of the issued and risks to both sides.” (Yaeckel
Decl., ¶ 5). The parties negotiated the Agreement with Hoffman’s assistance. (Id.)
 
          Sufficiency
of Investigation and Discovery 
On
July 11, 2023, Harris served a written PAGA Notice to both the LWDA and Pocino.
(Yaeckel Decl., ¶ 3). On September
14, 2023, after the statutory notice period expired, Harris filed the operative
complaint. (Id., ¶ 4). 
Prior
to litigation, Plaintiff’s counsel conducted a preliminary investigation into
the factual bases for Plaintiff’s claims and prepared a detailed letter to the
LWDA. (Id., ¶ 8.) On October 3, 2023, Harris propounded his first set of
written discovery requests (five separate devices) on Pocino, seeking the
identities of putative PAGA members, compensation policies, employee handbooks,
wage statements, payroll records, time records, and reimbursement policies. (Id.,
¶ 9.) Pocino turned over a large sampling (20%) of the time and wage records
for other putative aggrieved employees during the operative limitations period,
as well as policies and procedures manuals covering, inter alia, employee
clock-in policies and procedures, attendance policies, meal periods/rest
periods, and overtime & premium pay. (Id., ¶ 11.) Pocino also
provided the employee demographic information including inter alia, total
employee numbers, current employee numbers, and pay period information) of the
potential PAGA representative group. (Id.) 
 
          Experience
of Counsel 
Yaeckel
has provided the Court with satisfactory information relative to his firm’s, as
well as his personal, experience in class action and representative action
(PAGA) litigation. (Yaeckel Decl., ¶¶ 22-25.) Attorney Raul Perez has likewise
presented satisfactory information in this regard. (Perez Decl., ¶¶ 6-13.)
Yaeckel
submits that the settlement is “fair, reasonable, and adequate, and is in the
best interests of the LWDA in light of all known facts and circumstances,
including the risk of significant delay and uncertainty associated with
litigation, and various defenses asserted by Defendants.” (Yaeckel Decl., ¶ 13;
see Perez Decl., ¶ 5.)
 
          Strengths
and Weaknesses of Plaintiff’s Case 
Harris
has provided the Court with a discussion of the risks of further litigation on
pages 12-14 of the motion. Again, the parties have determined that there are
approximately 234 Aggrieved Employees who worked during a total of
approximately 14,500 PAGA Pay Periods. Harris calculates Pocino’s statutory penalty
exposure as approximately $1,450,000.00 (i.e., 14,500 violative pay periods (x)
$100.00[FN2]) but
acknowledges the Court’s wide latitude to drastically reduce the amount. 
The
Court finds that the settlement is “fair, reasonable, and adequate in view of
PAGA’s purposes,” based on the foregoing. 
 
          Scope
of the Release
“Released PAGA Claims” means “the claims being
released by the Plaintiff; the State of California and LWDA; and PAGA Counsel
and as described in Paragraph 5 below.” (Section 1, ¶ 1.25.) The Aggrieved
Employees are releasing Pocino and its former and present directors, officers,
shareholders, owners, members, attorneys, insurers, predecessors, successors,
assigns, subsidiaries, agents, and affiliates “from all claims for PAGA
penalties that were alleged, or reasonably
could have been alleged, based on the PAGA Period facts stated in the Operative
Complaint the 7 of 11 PAGA Notice, including claims for PAGA penalties premised
on: (1) meal and rest period violations, (2) minimum wage violations, (3)
overtime violations, (4) wage statement violations, (5) failure to reimburse
business expenses, and (6) failure to pay wages upon separation.” (Section 1, ¶ 1.26; Section 5, ¶ 5.2.) 
“Because
an aggrieved employee’s action under the Labor Code Private Attorneys General
Act of 2004 functions as a substitute for an action brought by the government
itself, a judgment in that action binds all those, including nonparty aggrieved
employees, who would be bound by a judgment in an action brought by the
government. The act authorizes a representative action only for the purpose of
seeking statutory penalties for Labor Code violations . . .” (Arias v. Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th
969, 986.) 
Harris
has additionally agreed to a general release of his individual claims and a
waiver of rights under Civil Code section 1542. 
The
Court finds that the release is fair, reasonable, and adequate. 
 
          Notice 
“PAGA
has no notice requirements for unnamed aggrieved employees, nor may such
employees opt out of a PAGA action.” (Baumann
v. Chase Inv. Services Corp. (9th Cir. 2014) 747 F.3d 1117,
1122.)
Again,
within 30 days of the “Effective Date,” Pocino will provide ILYM with Aggrieved
Employee Data in the form of a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, which will include
each Aggrieved Employee's name, last-known mailing address, Social Security
number and number of PAGA Pay Periods. (Section 1, ¶ 1.5; Section 4, ¶ 4.2.) 
Within
14 days after Pocino funds the GSA (i.e., due no later than 30 days after the
Effective Date), ILYM will mail checks for all Individual PAGA Payments. (Agreement,
Section 4, ¶¶ 4.3 and 4.4.) Before mailing
any checks, ILYM will update the recipients’ mailing addresses using the
National Change of Address Database. (Agreement, Section 4, ¶ 4.4.1.) Within 7 days
of receiving a returned check, ILYM must re-mail checks to the USPS forwarding
address provided or to an address ascertained through the Aggrieved Employee
Address Search, which involves the use of all reasonably available sources,
methods and means including, but not limited to, the National Change of Address
database, skip traces and direct contact by ILYM with Aggrieved Employees. (Agreement,
Section 4, ¶ 4.4.2.) 
The
Court finds that the foregoing procedure is appropriate. 
 
          Attorney
Fees and Costs 
The
Agreement provides that attorney’s fees
to be paid to Harris’ counsel are not to exceed 3.33% (i.e., $116,550.00) of
the GSA. (Section 3, ¶ 3.2.1.) Costs have been incurred in the amount of
$10,731.01. (Yaeckel Decl. ¶ 21; Perez Decl. ¶ 19.) 
The
Court finds the requested attorney’s fees to be reasonable pursuant to the percentage
method from a “common fund.” (Lafitte v. Robert Half Intern. Inc. (2016)
1 Cal.5th 480, 486). Further, Plaintiff’s counsel has provided the Court with a
Lodestar calculation of $178,080.00. (Yaeckel Decl., ¶ 14; Perez Decl., ¶ 15.)
The Court further finds the requested costs to be reasonable and adequately
supported by Yaeckel’s and Perez’s respective declarations. (Yaekel Decl., ¶
21, Exh. 3; Perez Decl., ¶ 19.) 
 
          Enhancement
Award 
Harris
will receive $10,000.00 as an
enhancement payment. (Agreement, Section 3, ¶ 3.2.2.) The Court finds this
award to be reasonable and adequately supported by Harris’s declaration.
 
          Administration
Costs
Settlement
administration costs are $3,500.00. (Agreement, Section 3, ¶ 3.2.3.) The Court
finds these costs to be reasonable.
IV.     Conclusion
For
the foregoing reasons, the motion is granted.
