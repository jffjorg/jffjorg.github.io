Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the anti-SLAPP motion filed by the defendants, Jerry Jamgotchian, El Segundo Plaza Associates L.P., and Theta Holding IV, Inc. The defendants argue that the complaint filed by the plaintiffs, DONE! Ventures, LLC and Coastal Laundromat, Inc., arises from protected activity under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16(e). The court agrees, finding that the defendants' actions in enforcing the judgment in BC674357, including the filing of abstracts of judgment and recording of judgment liens, are protected activity. The court also finds that the defendants have carried their burden to show that the complaint has no possibility of success and that there are no triable issues of fact. Therefore, the court grants the anti-SLAPP motion and strikes the entirety of the complaint.
