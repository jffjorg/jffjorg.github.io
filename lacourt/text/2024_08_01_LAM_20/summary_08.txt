And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to bifurcate the trial in a case involving wrongful termination and violations of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), Unfair Competition Law (UCL), and Labor Code. The defendants, Brad Lyon and FS Management, seek to bifurcate the trial to determine whether they are managing agents or joint employers with the plaintiff, High Voltage Tattoo, Inc. (HVT). The Judge notes that the defendants provided ministerial services to HVT, such as cutting payroll checks, but made no decisions about hiring, firing, or layoffs. The Judge believes that there is a fair likelihood that the evidence for joint employer liability will overlap with the evidence for substantive liability, and that FS will be a key witness for the wage and hour claims. Therefore, the motion to bifurcate the trial is denied. The Judge encourages counsel to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
