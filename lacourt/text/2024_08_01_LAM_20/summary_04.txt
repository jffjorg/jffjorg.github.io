Judge's Tentative Ruling:

On May 2, 2023, a Second Amended Complaint was filed by Plaintiff Robert Gooch, alleging failure to pay attorneys' fees and repair property, and on June 23, 2023, a Cross-Complaint was filed, alleging failure to pay rent. On April 5, 2024, the Court granted Defendant PR2020, LLC's three motions to compel responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests of production from Plaintiff Gooch. However, Gooch failed to comply with the Court's order, and Defendant PR2020, LLC seeks terminating, issue, evidentiary, and/or monetary sanctions. The Court finds that Gooch's failure to comply with the Court's order constitutes a misuse of the discovery process and will enter a terminating sanction by striking Gooch's Second Amended Complaint and Cross-Complaint, and entering his default.
