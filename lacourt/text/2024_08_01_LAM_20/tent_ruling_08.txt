This is an action for wrongful termination and violations of the FEHA, UCL, and Labor Code.  Defendants Brad Lyon and FS Management (“FS”) now seek to bifurcate trial and first determine the issue of whether Lyon and FS are managing agents of or joint employers with Defendant High Voltage Tattoo, Inc. (“HVT”).  They contend that this would be efficient because “[t]he evidence at trial will show that FS Management and Lyon made no decisions about hiring, firing, or laying off employees at High Voltage, had no involvement in setting working conditions for employees at High Voltage, and made no decisions about salary or compensation of employees at High Voltage. Rather, they provided ministerial services for High Voltage, such as cutting payroll checks. . . . A separate trial on this issue will involve limited witnesses and should be extremely short, likely no longer than a day.”“Whether separate actions shall be consolidated for trial, or whether there shall be a severance and separate trials of issues in a single action, is within the discretion of the trial court.”  (Mellone v. Lewis (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 4, 7, quoting McArther v. Shaffer (1943) 59 Cal.App.2d 724, 727.)  The objectives of bifurcated trials are to “expedite and simplify the presentation of evidence” (Foreman & Clark Corp. v. Fallon (1971) 3 Cal.3d 875, 888), and “avoidance of the waste of time and money caused by the unnecessary trial of damage questions in cases where the liability issue was resolved against the plaintiff.”  (Plaza Tulare v. Tradewell Stores, Inc. (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 522, 524.)With respect to Lyon, he is only a party for the first cause of action for violations of Lab. Code § 1102.5.  Lyon does not have individual liability for this claim.   (United States ex rel. Lupo v. Quality Assurance Servs. Inc. (S.D. Cal. 2017) 242 F.Supp.3d 1020, 1030; Tillery v. Lollis (E.D. Cal. Aug. 13, 2015) 2015 WL 4873111, at *10; Conner v. Aviation Servs. of Chevron U.S.A. (N.D. Cal. Nov. 5, 2014) 2014 WL 5768727, at *5; Bales v. Cty. of EL Dorado (E.D. Cal. Sept. 20, 2018) 2018 WL 4558235, at *2; Gaab et al., Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Trial Claims and Def. (The Rutter Group 2019) Ch. 13(V)-B [“Federal district courts have held that individual managers are not liable under § 1102.5.”].)  Thus, the issue of bifurcation is frankly irrelevant for Lyon, who should ultimately be dismissed.    With respect to FS, the Court believes that there is a fair likelihood that the evidence for joint employer liability will overlap with the evidence for substantive liability.  Additionally, FS is likely to be a key witness for, at the very least, the wage and hour claims to the extent it admittedly provided payroll services for HVT.  Bifurcation would, thus, not be greatly beneficial.  The Motion is deniedMoving parties to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
