```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by non-party Sid Kohan to intervene in the case. Sid claims that the Court's February 23, 2021, ruling that his Deeds of Trust (DOTs) were void was invalid because he was an indispensable party. However, the Court finds that Sid's request is not timely because the primary order he complains of was entered over three years ago, Nejat's condo was sold over two years ago, and the Court already entered an order foreclosing against Nejat's distributions. The Court also notes that Sid already obtained a settlement from Nejat for committing malpractice with respect to the DOTs. The Court denies Sid's motion to intervene, citing Code Civ. Proc. ยง 387 and precedents such as Truck Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (1997) and Crestwood Behavioral Health, Inc. v. Lacy (2021).
