And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

This is a tentative ruling in an action filed by law firm Freedman + Taitelman, LLP, which alleges that defendants S.P. Das Enterprises, LLC, d.b.a. Das Films, LLC, and Sriram Das failed to pay outstanding attorneys' fees of $286,969.62. The plaintiff also claims that Sriram Das is an alter ego of Das Films. The plaintiff has made requests for production, seeking information related to its alter ego allegations, and is seeking to compel further responses from the defendants. The defendants argue that the requests are overbroad and infringe on their privacy rights. The court has granted the plaintiff's motion as to certain requests, but narrowed the scope of those requests to January 1, 2016, to the present. The court has denied the plaintiff's motion as to other requests, finding them to be overbroad. The court has granted the motion in part and ordered the defendants to provide further responses and production within 30 days. The court has declined to award sanctions and has overruled the defendants' objections.
