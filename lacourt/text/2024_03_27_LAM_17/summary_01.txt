Significant Statements:

- "Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’"
- "It appears imposing less severe sanctions in the form of issue, evidentiary, and/or monetary sanctions against Plaintiff would not produce compliance."
- "It is clear from Plaintiff's conduct that they are disinterested in prosecuting this case against Redwood."
