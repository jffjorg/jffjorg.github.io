 Hearing Date:  March 27, 2024



 
            Cross-Defendant’s Demurrer to the
Cross-Complaint is SUSTAINED with 10 days leave to amend.
 
            On December 7, 2023, plaintiff Brianna Lingel
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against defendants YHALLTOGETHER, Inc. (“YT”),
Young Hee Seo (“Young”) and Does 1-50 (“Defendants”) alleging three causes of
action for (1) conversion, (2) retaliation, and (3) wrongful termination. Young
is YT’s CEO and CFO. (Compl., ¶ 3.)
 
In late September or early October 2023, Plaintiff began working
as a cashier at a restaurant owned by Defendants. (Compl., ¶ 11.) Plaintiff
alleges that was subject to Defendants’ numerous unlawful policies. Defendants required
an employee to pay Defendants with their own money if: (1) the employee
mistakenly did not charge a customer for an add-on food item; (2) a bill that
the employee handled ended up being counterfeit; (3) if there was a mistake
with an online pick-up order that the employee handled; or (4) if the cash
register did not have the correct amount of money at the end of the employee’s
shift. (Id., ¶ 12.) Defendants also employed an unlawful tip
distribution system. (Id., ¶ 13.) On two occasions in October and
November 2023, Plaintiff alerted Defendants that the cash register was short by
small amounts and was told that she must pay the difference. (Id., ¶¶
14-15.) On November 9 and 10, 2023, Plaintiff complained to Defendants about
the repayment and tip policies. On November 12, 2023, Plaintiff was terminated.
(Id., ¶ 16.)
 
On January 23, 2024, Defendants filed a cross-complaint
against Plaintiff along with an answer to Plaintiff’s complaint, alleging a
single cause of action for conversion. Defendants allege that Plaintiff converted
“soft drinks, sauces, and other property” that were meant to be used by
restaurant customers. (XC, ¶ 3.)
 
On February 20, 2024, Plaintiff brought the instant
demurrer and motion to strike Defendants’ cross-complaint. Defendants filed an
opposition on March 12, 2024. Plaintiff replied on March 21, 2024.
 
Legal
Standard
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action.¿ (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747 (Hahn).) ¿When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context.¿ (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water
and Power¿(2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)¿ In a
demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading
or via proper judicial notice.¿ (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿ “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and
not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.¿ Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the
face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.”¿ (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153
Cal.App.3d 902, 905.)¿ “The
only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it
stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”¿ (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at
p. 747.) 
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend
must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is
on the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully.
(Ibid.) “If there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a
good cause of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to
amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240,
245.)   
 
“Any party, within the time allowed to
respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole
or any part thereof.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 435(b)(1).) A court may “[s]trike out
any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 436(a).)  A court may “[s]trike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
436(b).)
 
Discussion

 
I.                  
Demurrer
 
Plaintiff demurs to Defendants’ one and only cause of
action for conversion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10(e) and
(f). Plaintiff argues that the cross-complaint fails to allege facts sufficient
to state a cause of action because the required factual elements to maintain
this cause of action are not pled and the cause of action is uncertain.
 
Conversion is the wrongful exercise of dominion of the
property of another. (Lee v. Hanley (2015) 61 Cal.4th 1225, 1240.) In
order to prove conversion, a party needs to show that “(1) the plaintiff’s
ownership or right to possession of the property; (2) the defendant’s
conversion by a wrongful act or disposition of property rights; and (3)
damages.” (Id.). Furthermore, a plaintiff must show the defendant acted
intentionally to wrongfully dispose of the property of another. (Duke v.
Superior Court (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 490, 508.)
 
            Plaintiff
argues that Defendants failed to plead any facts to establish the second
element. Indeed, the bare-bones cross-complaint does not allege any facts
beyond the conclusory statements that “Cross-Defendant intentionally converted
said soft drinkers[sic], sauces and other property without paying for them.”
(XC, ¶ 3.)
 
            Plaintiff
further contends that the cross-complaint is fatally uncertain as it identifies
the converted goods as soft drinks, sauces, and “other property”. (XC, ¶¶ 2-3.)
Such a pleading fails to put Plaintiff on notice of the claims asserted against
her and prevents her from preparing an adequate answer. 
 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s demurrer to the cross-complaint is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
II.              
Motion to Strike
 
Plaintiff moves to strike punitive
damages from the cross-complaint. Punitive damages may be recovered upon a
proper showing of malice, fraud, or oppression. (Civ. Code § 3294(a)). There is
no such showing in the cross-complaint. The Cross-Complaint’s only support for
punitive damages are two sentences that assert, in a conclusory manner, that Plaintiff
“intentionally converted said soft drinkers[sic], sauces, and other property”
and “Cross-Complainant is entitled to recover punitive damages for the property
which was intentionally stolen.” (XC, ¶¶ 3, 5)
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to
strike punitives is granted. 
 
It is
so ordered.
