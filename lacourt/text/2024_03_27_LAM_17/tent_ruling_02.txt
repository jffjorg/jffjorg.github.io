[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING
  MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
 
Hearing Date: March 27,
  2024




 
            Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be relieved is GRANTED. 
 
            On March 20, 2023, a group of 19 plaintiffs (“Plaintiffs”)
filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants WH
Vaughn 24 LLC, Williams Communities, LLC and Does 1-1,000 (“Defendants”) for
violations of building standards under Civil Code §§ 896 et seq. and 897.  
 
            On February 27, 2024, Counsel for Plaintiff Ericka
Estacio (“Counsel”) filed the instant motion to be relieved as counsel.  As of March 21, 2024, no opposition has been
filed.  
 
Legal Standard
 
Motions to
withdraw are routinely granted if made in the proper form and presented with
proper notice.  The court may issue an order allowing an attorney to
withdraw from representation, after notice to the client.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 284(2).) 
 
CRC Rule 3.1362
requires motions to be relieved as counsel pursuant to CCP section 284(2) be
made on Judicial Council Forms MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052
(Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order).  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362.)  Furthermore, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case.  (Id., rule
3.1362(d).)  If the client is served by mail, there must be a declaration
showing confirmation of the service address within the past 30 days or that the
service address is the last known residence or business address of the client
and the attorney has been unable to locate a more current address after making
reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the filing of the motion. 
(Id.) 
 
Discussion 
 
Counsel’s
declaration contains facts in paragraph 2 showing that she seeks to withdraw due
to an irreparable breakdown in the attorney-client relationshsip.  (MC-052 ¶ 2.)
 
The
Court finds that there is good cause to grant leave to withdraw.  
 
Counsel
has submitted forms MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053 in seeking to be relieved as
counsel.  The moving papers were served
on Plaintiff at their current addresses by overnight delivery as confirmed by
the proof of service.  Therefore, the Court
finds that Counsel has satisfied the requirements of CRC 3.1362(a), (c)-(e) by
filing the motions on the correct forms and by serving the motion on Plaintiff.   
 
The
Court notes that trial is set for September 30, 2024 and Plaintiff has
sufficient to find new counsel.
 
Therefore,
the Court grants the unopposed motion and Plaintiff’s counsel will be granted
leave to withdraw. 
 
Counsel
to give notice.
