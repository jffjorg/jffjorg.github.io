 Hearing Date: March 27, 2024




 
            Defendant Redwood Fire and Casualty Insurance Company’s
motion for terminating sanctions is GRANTED. The Complaint is DISMISSED with
prejudice against Defendant Redwood Fire and Casualty Insurance Company.
 
            On July 20, 2022, Plaintiffs Ghazar Shabazyan and Gold
Point Towing Inc. (Plaintiffs) filed suit against Defendants Berkshire Hathaway
Homestate Insurance Company (Berkshire), Redwood Fire and Casualty Insurance
Company (Redwood), Coverhound LLC dba Coverhound Insurance Solutions
(Coverhound), and DOES 1-50 (collectively, Defendants) alleging: (1) breach of
contract; (2) breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing; and (3) insurance
broker negligence. 
 
            Redwood moves for terminating sanctions or, in the alternative,
issue, evidentiary, and monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,800.00 against
Plaintiff. 
 
Legal Standard
 
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure Section 2030.030, “[t]o the extent authorized by the
chapter governing any particular discovery method..., the court, after notice
to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing,
may impose... [monetary, evidence, and terminating] sanctions against anyone
engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process....” Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010 provides that “[m]issues of the discovery process include,
but are not limited to, the following:... (d) Failing to respond or to submit
to an authorized method of discovery.... (g) Disobeying a court order to
provide discovery....” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030.)
 
“The
trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse 'after
considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to
determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party;
and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.’” (Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390 (quoting Lang
v. Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246).) “Generally, ‘[a] decision to
order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation
is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’” (Los
Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 (citation
omitted).)   
 
“Under
this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating sanctions when
parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders.” (Id.
(citing Lang, supra, 77 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244- 1246); see, e.g., Collisson
X Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 (terminating
sanctions imposed after defendants failed to comply with one court order to
produce discovery); Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231
Cal App 3d 481, 491 (disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCucchen
(1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4) (terminating sanctions imposed against
plaintiff for failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating various
discovery statutes).)   
 
Discussion 
 
            On May 17, 2023, Redwood served Plaintiff Gold Point
Towing, Inc. with its Special Interrogatories (Set One) and Form
Interrogatories (Set One). (Yu Decl., ¶ 2.) Plaintiff failed to provide
responses to either sets of discovery by the due date of June 21, 2023. (Id.)
On July 27, 2023, Redwood’s counsel wrote to Plaintiff’s counsel requesting
that Plaintiff provide verified responses to the written discovery without
objection. (Id., at ¶ 3.) No responses were received and Redwood filed
two motions to compel Plaintiff’s Responses to the sets of discovery on October
20, 2023 and Request for Admission motion October 24, 2023. (Id., at ¶
4.)
 
            On November 20, 2023, this Court heard Redwood’s motions
to compel. (Id.) Plaintiff did not file an opposition and did not appear
at the hearing. This Court granted the motions to compel and ordered Plaintiff
to provide verified responses and documents without objections within 30 days
of the order or by December 20, 2023. (Yu Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. A.)
 
            On December 10, 2023, Plaintiff served responses to
Redwood’s Request for Admissions. (Id., at ¶ 6, Ex. B.) On December 15,
2023, this Court ruled that Redwood’s Request for Admission motion was moot in
light of the responses being served but ordered Plaintiff pay sanctions within
30 days from the order for failing to timely respond and necessitating the
filing of the motion. (Id.)
 
            On December 22, 2023, Redwood informed Plaintiff’s
counsel that it would file a motion for sanctions after not receiving any
responses and sanctions as ordered by this Court. (Id., at ¶ 7.)
Plaintiff’s counsel responded on the same day indicating he would “get this in
your inbox.” (Id.) Redwood still has not received any responses,
documents, or payment of sanctions. (Id.)
 
            The Court finds that Plaintiff has engaged in conduct
that constitutes an abuse of the discovery process. Plaintiff failed to obey
the Court’s November 20, 2023 and December 15, 2023 orders to provide verified
responses and documents without objections, and pay sanctions within 30 days of
the orders. As such, it appears imposing less severe sanctions in the form of
issue, evidentiary, and/or monetary sanctions against Plaintiff would not
produce compliance. Additionally, Plaintiff did not file an opposition to the
motions to compels and Request for Admission motion, which resulted in the
present orders at issue. Lastly, Plaintiff was served with notice of this
instant motion and again did not file an opposition. Thus, it is clear from
Plaintiff’s conduct that they are disinterested in  prosecuting this case against Redwood. 
 
In
light of the foregoing, the motion for terminating sanctions is GRANTED.
Plaintiffs’ complaint is DISMISSED with prejudice against Defendant Redwood
Fire and Casualty Insurance Company. 
 
 
It is so ordered.
