Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production. The plaintiff had requested that the defendant produce documents related to the transmission defect in vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the subject vehicle. The defendant had already provided some documents in response to the requests for production, but the plaintiff argued that they were incomplete and did not provide all the requested information.

The judge found that the defendant's responses were adequate and that the plaintiff's requests were too broad. The judge also noted that the defendant had already supplemented its production to include documents related to customer complaints, claims, and warranty claims, which was sufficient to meet the plaintiff's discovery requests.

The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for a trade secret privilege, as the defendant did not show that a protective order would be inadequate to protect its confidential and proprietary information.
