Roles:
  - Judge: Hon. Jon R. Takasugi
  - Plaintiff: Brianna Lingel
  - Defendant: YHALLTOGETHER, Inc. et al
Significant Statements:
  - "A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters."
  - "If there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend."
  - "Conversion is the wrongful exercise of dominion of the property of another."
  - "In order to prove conversion, a party needs to show that '(1) the plaintiff’s ownership or right to possession of the property; (2) the defendant’s conversion by a wrongful act or disposition of property rights; and (3) damages.'"

Summary:
The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the cross-complaint with 10 days leave to amend. The ruling also grants the motion to strike punitive damages from the cross-complaint. The Judge finds that the cross-complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action for conversion, and that the pleading is uncertain and fails to put the plaintiff on notice of the claims asserted against her.
