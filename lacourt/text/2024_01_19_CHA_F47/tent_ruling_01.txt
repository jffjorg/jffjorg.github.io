Case #23CHCV01907
 
MOTION TO SET
ASIDE JUDGMENT 
& 
QUASH ANY WRIT
OF POSSESSION/EXECUTION
 
Motion filed on 10/4/23.
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Lorraine Briones
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Northwestern Mutual Life
Insurance Company
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order setting aside the
judgment entered in this case and quashing any writ of possession and/or
execution. 
 
RULING: The motion is denied.
 
On 6/29/23, Plaintiff Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance
Company dba Terrena (Plaintiff) filed this action against Defendant Lorraine
Briones (Defendant) for unlawful detainer of the premises located at 9400
Corbin Ave., Unit 3088, Northridge, California 91324.  On 7/19/23, Defendant, representing herself,
filed an answer to the complaint.  On
8/1/23, the Court served the parties with notice that the unlawful detainer
trial was scheduled for 8/16/23 at 9:00 a.m. 

 
On 8/16/23, Defendant did not appear for trial and/or
communicate with the court regarding her failure to appear.  (See 8/16/23 Minute Order).  The trial proceeded and judgment was entered
for Plaintiff and against Defendant for the principal amount of $42,655.08,
attorney fees of $1,200.00 and costs off $435.00 for a total of $44,290.08.  Id.; (See also 8/16/23
Judgment).  Restitution and possession of
the premises was also granted for Plaintiff. 
Id.  
 
On 8/29/23, Plaintiff filed an Application for Writ of
Possession.  On 8/30/23, a Writ of
Execution for Possession only was issued. 
On 10/4/23, Defendant filed an ex parte application for stay of
execution of judgment pending a motion to set aside and a motion to set
aside/vacate judgment.  The motion was originally
scheduled for hearing on 12/20/23 and was subsequently continued by the Court
to 1/19/24.  (See 12/1/23 Notice
of Continuance and Order).  On 10/6/23,
the Court denied Defendant’s ex parte application.  (See 10/6/23 Minute Order).  On 11/20/23, the writ – return was
filed.  
 
The motion to set aside judgment and quash any writ of
possession fails for both procedural and substantive reasons.  First, no proof of service for the motion has
been filed and no response to the motion has been filed by Plaintiff to cure
the defect in notice.  Second, while
Defendant claims that she had a medical emergency on the day of trial and was
in the emergency room, Defendant provides no documentation from an emergency
room visit on 8/16/23.  Rather, Defendant
provides documentation from an exam performed two days later on 8/18/23.  Additionally, Defendant does not explain she
could not have called the courtroom to explain the situation or have her
husband or mother, both of whom she claims to have been in contact with on the
morning of 8/16/23, call on her behalf.
