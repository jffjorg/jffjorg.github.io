And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Lorraine Briones, has filed a motion to set aside the judgment entered in this case and quash any writ of possession and/or execution. The motion is denied.

The defendant failed to appear for trial on August 16, 2023, and did not communicate with the court regarding her failure to appear. As a result, judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiff, Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company, for the principal amount of $42,655.08, attorney fees of $1,200.00, and costs of $435.00.

The defendant's motion is based on the claim that she had a medical emergency on the day of trial and was in the emergency room. However, the defendant provides no documentation from an emergency room visit on August 16, 2023, and only provides documentation from an exam performed two days later. Additionally, the defendant does not explain why she could not have communicated with the court regarding her failure to appear or had someone else call on her behalf.

The motion is denied due to both procedural and substantive reasons. First, no proof of service for the motion has been filed and no response to the motion has been filed by the plaintiff to cure the defect in notice. Second, the defendant's claim of medical emergency is not supported by documentation and the defendant does not explain why she could not have communicated with the court regarding her failure to appear.
