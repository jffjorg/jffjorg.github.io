[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
METRO’S DEMURRER
  TO PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT; 
 
METRO’S MOTION
  TO STRIKE THE FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION OF PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT



 
Background
Plaintiff Christopher Rosales (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on February
15, 2024 against a number of defendants, including Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The Complaint alleges causes of action
for (1) assault, (2) battery, (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress,
(4) negligent hiring, supervision and retention, and (5) negligence. 
Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority
(“Metro”) now demurs to the fourth cause of action of the Complaint and moves
to strike the fourth cause of action from the Complaint. Plaintiff opposes
both. 
Discussion 
As an initial matter, Metro’s
counsel’s declaration in support of the demurrer indicates, inter alia,
that “I sent a meet and confer correspondence and proposed stipulation
regarding the issues in this demurrer and accompanying motion to strike. As of
the filing of this demurrer, Plaintiff has not agreed to amend and/or
stipulate. Should Plaintiff agree, Metro will take the demurrer off the Court’s
calendar.” (Yehoshua Decl., ¶ 2.) In addition, Metro’s counsel’s declaration in
support of the motion to strike provides, inter alia, that “[p]rior to
filing the instant motion to strike, I attempted to meet and confer regarding
the instant motion by sending a meet and confer correspondence to Plaintiff’s
counsel and sending a proposed stipulation to Plaintiff’s counsel. As of the
date of the filing of the instant motion to strike, Plaintiff has not agreed to
stipulate to strike the language at issue. We will continue to attempt to reach
a resolution without the need for court intervention.” (Yehoshua Decl., ¶ 2.)
The Court notes that Metro’s
counsel’s declarations do not demonstrate that the parties met and conferred by
telephone or in person, or that Metro’s counsel attempted to do so. 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
430.41, subdivision (a), “[b]efore filing a
demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and
confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the
party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Emphasis added.) In
addition, “[b]efore filing a motion to
strike pursuant to this chapter, the moving party shall meet and confer in
person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party who filed the
pleading that is subject to the motion to strike for the purpose of determining
if an agreement can be reached that resolves the objections to be raised in the
motion to strike.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5, subd. (a), emphasis
added.) Such meeting and conferring
must be done in good faith with an effort to try to resolve the issues subject
to the demurrer and motion to strike. 
In light of the foregoing,
the hearing on Metro’s demurrer
and motion to strike is continued to _______________, 2024 at 2
p.m. in Dept. 50. 
Metro
is¿ordered to meet¿and confer¿with Plaintiff within 10 days of the date of this
order.¿If the parties are unable to resolve the pleading issues¿or if the
parties are otherwise unable to meet and confer in good faith, Metro is to¿thereafter¿file
and serve¿a declaration setting forth the efforts to meet and confer in
compliance with¿Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41,
subdivision (a)(3) and Code
of Civil Procedure section 435.5, subdivision (a)(3) within 15 days of this order.¿
Metro is ordered to give notice of this order.
