[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
MOTION TO SET
  ASIDE/VACATE DISMISSAL VEXATIOUS LITIGANT



 
Background 
On July 3, 2019, Plaintiff Tito Ace Thomas
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants County of Los Angeles, “Los
Angeles County Mental Health,” and Sandra Preciado. The Complaint appears to
allege causes of action for (1) “deprivation of civil rights – false evidence
violations,” and (2) “failure to prevent discrimination and harassment and
assault.” 

On August 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion captioned “motion to set
aside/vacate dismissal vexatious litigant.” The motion indicates that Plaintiff
“appeals from the superior court’s order denying his petition and Motion to Set
Aside/Vacate Dismissal Vexatious Litigant move forward [sic] with his case and
not hold up the case where it shows that Mr. Thomas was lied on by Defendants
COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES, COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES SHERIFF, and others and Case No.:
YA094365 was dismiss on or about December 4, 2023.” The motion is unopposed. 
 
Discussion 
As an initial matter, it
is unclear what relief Plaintiff seeks in the instant motion. As set forth
above, Plaintiff states that he “appeals” from an unspecified “order
denying his petition...” (Mot. at p. 1:19-20.) To the extent Plaintiff seeks an
order setting aside such unspecified order, Plaintiff does not provide any
legal authority to support such request. The Court does not find that Plaintiff
has provided any legal basis to set aside an unspecified “order denying his
petition.”  
Conclusion
In light of the foregoing, Plaintiff’s “motion to set aside/vacate
dismissal vexatious litigant” is denied.   
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
