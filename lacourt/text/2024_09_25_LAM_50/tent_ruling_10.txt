[1]It appears
Plaintiff’s reference to “Second Amended Complaint” in the caption page of the
motion is a typo, as Plaintiff moves for “an order permitting the filing of a
First Amended Complaint…” (Notice of Mot. at p. 2:6-7.)  


[2]The caption page
of the Complaint lists a fifteenth cause of action for “unfair competition.”
However, the Complaint does not appear to allege any unfair competition cause
of action. 


[3]In addition, after
Plaintiff filed her reply in support of the instant motion, Defendants filed a
notice of errata attaching Defendants’ counsel’s declaration in support of the
opposition. Defendants indicate that “the declaration was inadvertently omitted
from the filing.” (See Notice of Errata.) Thus, it does not appear that
Plaintiff was served with the declaration in advance of Plaintiff’s filing of
the reply. Plaintiff states that “Defendants failed to file and serve a
declaration and exhibits in tandem with its Opposition…” (Reply at p. 1:23-24.)
Thus, the Court does not consider Defendants’ counsel’s declaration in support
of the opposition herein.
