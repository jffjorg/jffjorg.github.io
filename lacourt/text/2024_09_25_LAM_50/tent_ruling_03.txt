[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT  



 
Plaintiff Sooyeon Jin (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default judgment
against Defendant James Bae in the total amount of $296,311.59, comprising $295,876.59 in damages and $435.00 in costs. 
The Court notes a few defects with the submitted request for default
judgment.  
First, in her supporting
declaration, Plaintiff states that she seeks, inter alia, $10,800.00 in damages for “Emergency Capital
Contribution #1.” (Suppl. Jin Decl., ¶ 11.) In the fourth cause of action of
the FAC for constructive fraud, Plaintiff alleges, inter alia, that
“PLAINTIFF’s reliance on K. BAE’s false representations caused PLAINTIFF
serious harm in that PLAINTIFF was forced to provide her capital contribution
to the emergency capital call of $35,000. Despite having received no proper
financial documents and K. BAE refusing to deposit his portion of the capital
call, PLAINTIFF deposited $10,800 of the initial $15,000 emergency capital
call, in good faith and in justified reliance on K. BAE’s false
representations.” (FAC, ¶ 96.) However, in connection with the instant
request, Plaintiff seeks the subject $10,800.00 in damages against James Bae.
The FAC does not appear to allege that Plaintiff is entitled to such damages
against James Bae. As discussed in the Court’s July 17, 2024 Order on
Plaintiff’s prior request for default judgment, “[i]t is imperative in a
default case that the trial court take the time to analyze the complaint at
issue and ensure that the judgment sought is not in excess of or inconsistent
with it. It is not in plaintiffs’ interest to be conservative in their demands,
and without any opposing party to point out the excesses, it is the duty of the
court to act as gatekeeper, ensuring that only the appropriate claims get
through. That role requires the court to analyze the complaint for itself--with
guidance from counsel if necessary--ascertaining what relief is sought as
against each defaulting party, and to what extent the relief sought in one
cause of action is inconsistent with or duplicative of the relief
sought in another. The court must then compare the properly pled damages
for each defaulting party with the evidence offered in the prove-up. (§ 585, subd. (b) [‘[T]he court shall hear the evidence
offered by the plaintiff, and shall render judgment in his or her favor for
such sum (not exceeding the amount stated in the complaint, in the statement
required by Section 425.11, or in the statement provided for by Section
425.115), as appears by such evidence to be just. . . .’].).” ((Heidary v. Yadollahi (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 857, 868.) 
Second, Plaintiff also seeks, inter alia, a total of $7,076.59
in damages related to certain tax liens Plaintiff “was not informed of by JAMES
BAE.” (Suppl. Jin Decl., ¶ 11.) However, Plaintiff does not appear to provide
evidence that she paid the subject tax debt, or otherwise explain how she
incurred such damages. Similarly, Plaintiff seeks “[a]pprox. $8,000.00” in
damages related to the “Temporary Closure of Birdies Norco by Riverside
Department of Environmental Health.” (Suppl. Jin Decl., ¶ 11.) However,
Plaintiff does not appear to state in her supporting declaration that she spent
$8,000.00 in connection with such closure, or otherwise provide evidence
showing that she incurred such damages. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for
default judgment without prejudice.

The Court will discuss with Plaintiff a schedule for
resubmission of the default judgment package.
