  ORDER RE:
 
PLAINTIFFS’
  MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS PURSUANT TO CIVIL
  CODE SECTION 1794(d)
 



            
Background
Plaintiffs William Burns
and Terri Burns (jointly, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action against Defendant
General Motors, LLC (“GM”) on August 23, 2021. The Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) breach of
implied warranty of merchantability under the Song-Beverly Act, (2) breach of
express warranty under the Song-Beverly Act, and (3) fraudulent inducement -
concealment. On February
14, 2022, the Court issued an Order sustaining GM’s demurrer to the 
third cause of action (fraudulent
inducement – concealment), without leave to amend.  
            Plaintiffs now move for an order
awarding their attorney fees, costs, and expenses. GM opposes. 
On July 31, 2024, the Court issued an Order continuing the hearing on
the instant motion to September 25, 2024, in light of certain procedural issues
with GM’s opposition papers. The Court’s July 31, 2024 Order provides, inter
alia, that “[o]n or before 8/9, 2024, GM is to file amended opposition papers that
comply with the applicable page number, spacing, and other relevant
requirements set forth in California Rules of Court,
rules 3.1113 and 2.108…No new evidence
or new argument is to be submitted in GM’s amended opposition papers. On or
before 8/30, 2024, Plaintiffs may file a new reply brief that will supersede the previously filed reply
papers.”
On August 9, 2024, GM filed an opposition to the motion. On
August 30, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a reply. 
Discussion
            Plaintiffs’
motion for attorneys’ fees and costs is continued as set forth
below.  
            Plaintiffs have interposed 26
numbered evidentiary objections. In addition, Plaintiffs interpose additional
(unnumbered) objections to “Pappas’ Declaration as to paragraphs 1-41, Exhibits
C through II, and all references to these Exhibits and information in GM’s
Opposition Papers…” (Plaintiffs’ Evidentiary Objections, p. 3:3-4.) Due to the
voluminous number of objections, the hearing on the motion will be continued to
a date that will be set at the Hearing on Objections discussed below. 
The Court orders the parties to meet and confer by telephone or in
person in a serious and good faith effort to resolve and eliminate the
objections. The only objections that should remain are those that pertain to material
evidence regarding material issues. Keeping the rules of evidence
in mind, the parties should be able to reduce the objections to just a few. If
any material objections remain unresolved, the parties are to set
them forth in a joint statement with the text, the objection, and the argument
of each side in favor of their respective positions regarding the remaining
material objections, along with a space for a ruling. 
The joint statement must be filed on or before _______ with a courtesy
copy delivered to Department 50. The Court will review any remaining objections
with lead counsel for the parties at a hearing on _______________ at
2:00 p.m. (the “Hearing on Objections”). The date for the hearing on the
motion will be set at the Hearing on Objections.   
If necessary, based upon the resolutions reached during the meet and
confer process and/or at the Hearing on Objections, the parties may
respectively file and serve revised briefing and evidence. The revised evidence
may eliminate objectionable material; however, no new evidence or new
argument is to be submitted unless it is as a result of compromises reached
during the meet and confer process. In the event that revised briefing
and evidence is necessary, the Court will discuss with the parties a briefing schedule
for the revised briefing at the Hearing on Objections.   
Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of this Order.
