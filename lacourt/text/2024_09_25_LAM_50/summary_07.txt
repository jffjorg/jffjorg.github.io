```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiffs' motion for an interlocutory judgment and appointment of a partition referee. The court finds that the motion is premature, as the trial has not yet occurred and the court has not yet determined whether the plaintiffs have a right to partition. The court also overrules the defendant's demurrer to the answer of the cross-defendants. The defendant's demurrer is untimely and does not dispute the plaintiffs' point that the demurrer is untimely.
