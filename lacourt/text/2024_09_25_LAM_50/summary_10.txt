And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion filed by the plaintiff to permit the filing of a First Amended Complaint. The judge notes that the plaintiff's reference to a "Second Amended Complaint" in the caption page of the motion appears to be a typo, and that the plaintiff is actually seeking to file a First Amended Complaint. The judge also finds that the complaint does not allege an unfair competition cause of action, despite the caption page listing a fifteenth cause of action for "unfair competition." Additionally, the judge determines that the declaration in support of the opposition filed by the defendants was not served on the plaintiff in advance of the plaintiff's filing of the reply, and therefore does not consider the declaration in support of the opposition.
