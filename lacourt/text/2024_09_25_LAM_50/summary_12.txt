And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has scheduled a hearing on September 25, 2024, to consider Metro's demurrer to the fourth cause of action of the Complaint and its motion to strike the same. Prior to the hearing, Metro is ordered to meet and confer with Plaintiff to resolve the pleading issues. If the parties are unable to reach an agreement, Metro must file a declaration setting forth its efforts to meet and confer in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure sections 430.41 and 435.5. The judge notes that Metro's counsel's declarations do not demonstrate meeting and conferencing with Plaintiff in good faith, and that such meeting and conferencing must be done in person, by telephone, or by video conference.
