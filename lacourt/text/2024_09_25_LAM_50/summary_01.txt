The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Tito Ace Thomas's motion to set aside/vacate dismissal vexatious litigant. The motion is unopposed and seeks to set aside an unspecified "order denying petition." However, the judge finds that the plaintiff has not provided any legal authority to support this request and has not provided a clear explanation of what relief he seeks. Therefore, the judge denies the motion. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
