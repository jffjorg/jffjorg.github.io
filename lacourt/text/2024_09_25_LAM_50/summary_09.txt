And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Plaintiff Adriana Aguilar's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint without prejudice. The motion was opposed by the defendants, who argued that the proposed amendments were untimely and would prejudice them. The Plaintiff sought to add new causes of action and parties to the complaint, including a new cause of action for negligent supervision and retention, and to amend the complaint to include new factual allegations.

The Judge noted that the Court may allow a party to amend a pleading in furtherance of justice, but that the Plaintiff's motion failed to comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subdivision (b). The Judge also found that the Plaintiff's failure to specify when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered and why the request for amendment was not made earlier was a deficiency in the motion.

The Judge also noted that the proposed amendments would require additional discovery and potentially delay the trial, which would prejudice the defendants. However, the Judge did not find that the proposed amendments were futile, and instead denied the motion without prejudice, allowing the Plaintiff to re-file the motion with the required information.
