```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the trial will be bifurcated, with the issues of punitive damages separated from the rest of the trial. This means that evidence of the defendant's profits and financial condition will not be admissible until after the jury has made a decision on the plaintiff's claim for actual damages and has found that the defendant acted with malice, oppression, or fraud. The judge has granted the defendant's motion to bifurcate the trial and has ordered that notice of this ruling be provided to all parties. The purpose of bifurcation is to avoid wasting time and money in trial and to preserve the right to trial by jury.
