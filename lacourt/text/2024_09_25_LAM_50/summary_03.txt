And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment against defendant James Bae without prejudice. The Judge noted that the plaintiff's supporting declaration contained defects, including an allegation of damages for an emergency capital contribution that is not supported by the complaint, and a request for damages related to tax liens without providing evidence of paying the tax debt or incurring the damages. The Judge also pointed out that the plaintiff did not provide evidence of the amount of damages incurred as a result of the temporary closure of Birdies Norco. The Judge ordered the plaintiff to resubmit the default judgment package and will discuss a schedule for resubmission with the plaintiff.
