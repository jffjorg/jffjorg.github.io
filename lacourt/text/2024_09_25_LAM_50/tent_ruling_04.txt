ORDER RE:
 
HYUNG M. DO’S
  MOTION FOR ORDER COMPELLING GENOVEVA RINCON’S FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUESTS
  FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS (SET ONE) AND REQUEST FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS OF
  $4,349.77



 
Plaintiff Hyung
M. Do (“Plaintiff”) moves for an order compelling Defendant Genoveva Rincon
(“Rincon”) to serve further responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of
Documents (Set One) and for monetary sanctions against Rincon in the amount of
$4,349.77.
Plaintiff’s motion will be continued to a new date as set forth below.
NO HEARING WILL TAKE PLACE ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2024.    
Pursuant to the
Court’s power to “amend and control its process and orders so as to make them
conform to law and justice” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(8)), the Court
orders the parties in this case to participate in a meet and confer with the
Court (“Informal Discovery Conference” or “IDC”). (Note:¿The Court’s policy
regarding IDCs appears in the Courtroom Information available in Dept. 50 and
on the Court’s website.)[1]¿Lead or
other designated counsel for the parties with full authority and any
self-represented party are ordered to participate in
person in an IDC. After consulting with opposing counsel and/or any
self-represented party regarding available dates, Plaintiff must make a prompt reservation for the IDC using the
Court’s online reservation system. Plaintiff
must file Dept. 50’s one-page IDC form in the department seven days prior to
the IDC, and the responding parties may file the same form in the department
setting forth a response three days prior to the IDC.   
Once Plaintiff has
confirmed an IDC date, Plaintiff must use the
Court’s online reservation system to continue the motion to a post-IDC
discovery hearing date. The parties are ordered to have with them whatever
materials are needed to make the IDC session productive and successful. Prior
to the IDC date, lead or other designated counsel for the parties with full
authority and any self-represented party are
to meet and confer, in person or via telephone in a
further attempt to resolve as many of the issues as possible before the IDC. (See
CRC Rule 3.670, subd. (f)(2).) If the
parties resolve their discovery disputes before the IDC date, Plaintiff is ordered to take both the IDC and the motion off
calendar as soon as possible. 
Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of this Order.
