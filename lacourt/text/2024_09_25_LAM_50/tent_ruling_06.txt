  ORDER RE:
 
MOTION BIFURCATE
  [sic] THE ISSUES OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES
 



 
            Background
On September 14, 2022, Plaintiff Lucia Beltre (“Plaintiff”) filed this
action against Defendant 1736 Family Crisis Center (“Defendant”). The Complaint
alleges causes of action for (1) disability discrimination in violation of FEHA,
(2) failure to accommodate a disability in violation of FEHA, (3) failure to
engage in the interactive process in violation of FEHA,  (4) retaliation in violation of FEHA, (5)
discrimination in violation of the California Family Rights Act, (6) wrongful
termination in violation of public policy, (7) willful misclassification in
violation of Labor Code § 226.8, (8) failure to
compensate for all hours worked, (9) failure to provide meal periods, (10)
failure to provide rest periods, (11) failure to provide accurate wage
statements in violation of Labor Code § 226, (12)
whistleblower retaliation in violation of Labor Code §
1102.5, and (13) waiting time penalties for unpaid wages under “Labor Code 203.” 

Defendant now moves for an order “bifurcating the issues of punitive damages
until liability is determined and a ruling is made that Defendant is guilty of
malice, oppression or fraud.” The motion is unopposed. 
Discussion 
Defendant requests that
the Court “enter an order bifurcating the issues relating to Plaintiff’s claim
for punitive damages unless and until an award of actual damages is made
against Defendant and it is determined Defendant acted with malice, fraud, or
oppression within the meaning of Civil Code § 3294.”
(Mot. at p. 5:12-15.) 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1048,
subdivision (b) provides: “[t]he court, in furtherance
of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive
to expedition and economy, may order a separate trial of any cause of action,
including a cause of action asserted in a cross-complaint, or of any separate
issue or of any number of causes of action or issues, preserving the right of
trial by jury required by the Constitution or a statute of this state or of the
United States.” ((Id., § 1048, subd. (b).) 
Code
of Civil Procedure sections 597 and 598 allow a court to order that the trial of any issue or part thereof
proceed before the trial of any other issue to promote the ends of justice or
the economy and efficiency of handling the litigation. Additionally, Evidence Code section 320 provides
that trial courts have discretion to regulate the order of proof. “[T]rial
courts have broad discretion to determine the order of proof in the interests
of judicial economy.” ((Grappo v. Coventry
Fin. Corp. (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d
496, 504.) The objective of bifurcation is “avoidance
of the waste of time and money caused by the unnecessary trial of damage
questions in cases where the liability issue is resolved against the plaintiff.”
((Horton v. Jones (1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 952, 955.)
Civil Code section 3295, subdivision (d) provides that “[t]he court shall, on application of any defendant,
preclude the admission of evidence of that defendant’s profits or financial
condition until after the trier of fact returns a verdict for plaintiff
awarding actual damages and finds that a defendant is guilty of malice,
oppression, or fraud in accordance with Section 3294.”
Civil Code section 3295, subdivision (d) goes on to state that “[e]vidence of profit and financial condition
shall be admissible only as to the defendant or defendants found to be liable
to the plaintiff and to be guilty of malice, oppression, or fraud.” This
section “requires a court, upon application of any defendant, to bifurcate a
trial so that the trier of fact is not presented with evidence of the
defendant’s wealth and profits until after the issues of liability,
compensatory damages, and malice, oppression, or fraud have been resolved
against the defendant.” ((Torres v. Automobile
Club of So. California (1997) 15
Cal.4th 771, 777-778.) 
Accordingly, the Court
finds that the punitive damages phase of trial must be bifurcated from the rest
of trial. Evidence of the profits and financial condition of Defendant will not be admissible at trial “until
after the trier of fact returns a verdict for plaintiff awarding actual damages
and finds that [Defendant] is guilty of malice, oppression, or fraud in
accordance with Section 3294.” (Civ. Code, § 3295, subd. (d).) 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing,
the Court grants Defendant’s motion.
The issue of the amount of punitive damages will not be tried and evidence of Defendant’s
profits and financial condition
will not be admitted unless and until after the trier of fact returns a verdict
for Plaintiff awarding actual damages and finds that Defendant is guilty of
malice, oppression, or fraud in accordance with Civil
Code section 3294.
            Defendant is to provide notice of this ruling.
