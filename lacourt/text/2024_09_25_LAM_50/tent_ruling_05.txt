[1]The Court notes
that Plaintiff filed an IDC Statement on April 9, 2024 regarding, inter alia,
“Requests for Production” Plaintiff served on Rincon. Plaintiff’s April 9, 2024
IDC Statement references an April 16, 2024 IDC hearing date. However, the
docket for this case does not appear to show that an IDC took place on April
16, 2024 or on any other date. It appears the April 16, 2024 IDC was taken off
calendar.
