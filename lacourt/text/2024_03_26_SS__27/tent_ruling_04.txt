Notice:                     Sufficient¿¿ 
 
Ruling:                     MOTIONS TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO SPECIAL
INTERROGATORIES, SET TWO, AND REQUEST FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS ARE GRANTED
 
Legal Standard¿ 
A plaintiff may make a demand for
production of documents and propound interrogatories without leave of court at
any time 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the
party to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for
production of documents is not limited by number, but the request must comply
with the formatting requirements in Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.030. A party
may propound 35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the
subject matter of the pending action and any additional number of official form
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (a)(1) - (a)(2).)¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
The party whom the request is
propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service of a
demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and
confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a)
- (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).)¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
If a party fails to timely respond
to a request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request
is directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)¿¿The party propounding the
discovery requests may move for an order compelling responses. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) Unlike a motion to compel further discovery responses, a
motion to compel initial discovery responses does not have any meet and confer
requirements.¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may
impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes
failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿¿A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable
monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare
Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)¿¿¿¿¿¿

Analysis and Conclusion
On October 28, 2021, Plaintiff filed the present assault and battery
case. On December 6, 2023, Defendant served his special interrogatories, Set
Two. Responses were due on January 9, 2024; however, none were provided. After
communications between the parties, Defendant granted an extension to January
26, 2024, for Plaintiff to submit the responses. Yet, Plaintiff failed to
provide the discovery responses by this extended deadline. Defendant now moves
the Court to Compel Plaintiff to provide a discovery response. Plaintiff did
not oppose the motion, and there is no evidence to suggest that the discovery
response at issue was served prior to the hearing date. Thus, Defendant's
Motion to Compel is GRANTED. Plaintiff is hereby ORDERED to provide verified
discovery responses without objections to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories,
Set Two, within 20 days of today’s date.
Plaintiff's failure to respond
forced Defendant to incur attorney's fees in filing the present motion. Defendant requests
sanctions in the amount of $1,150.00. The Court
finds this amount reasonable. Consequently, the Court sanctions Plaintiff in
the amount of $1,150.00. Plaintiff and his counsel are ORDERED,
jointly and severally, to pay sanctions of $1,150.00 to Defendant
Steve Limb within 20 days of today’s date.
