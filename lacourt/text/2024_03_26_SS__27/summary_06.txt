The Plaintiff initially filed the case on March 8, 2023, and then amended the complaint on May 31, 2023. However, the Plaintiff inadvertently omitted supporting exhibits from the amended complaint. The Plaintiff now seeks to add these exhibits to the complaint without altering the factual basis of the complaint. The Defendant does not oppose the motion and will not be prejudiced by the amendment. The Judge has granted the motion, allowing the Plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 20 days of the order.
