And here is the English-text summary:

Judge Lee S. Arian has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion for trial preference. The plaintiff, Linda Wang, is over 70 years old and has a substantial interest in the action. The court finds that the plaintiff's advanced age, numerous pre-existing health conditions, memory issues, and need for future surgeries make it necessary to grant a trial preference to prevent prejudicing her interests. The defendant does not oppose the motion. The trial date is maintained, and the court will set the matter for trial within 120 days of the date of the ruling.
