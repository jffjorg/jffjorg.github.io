The judge grants the defendant's unopposed motion to continue the trial and all related deadlines to a date in October 2024. The defendant needs additional time for discovery due to the bankruptcy stay, which limited discovery to approximately one year. The judge finds that a six-month continuance is reasonable and grants the motion. The new trial date is set for October __, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., and the Final Status Conference is continued to October __, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. All case-related deadlines will be adjusted in accordance with the new trial date.
