And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel responses to special interrogatories, Set Two, and requests for monetary sanctions. The plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests, despite an informal agreement to extend the deadline. The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to respond waives any right to object to the discovery requests and allows the court to impose a monetary sanction. The court orders the plaintiff to provide verified discovery responses within 20 days and sanctions the plaintiff in the amount of $1,150.00.
