And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the application for default judgment and has determined that the evidence presented is insufficient to enter a default judgment for any amount against any defendant. The court has identified several deficiencies in the Zhao Declaration, including the lack of bank account statements, confirmation of wire transfers, and attachments of WeChat messages. The court also finds that the declaration lacks clarity on key points, such as the transfer of $300,000 and the return on investment. The court concludes that many of these deficiencies may be correctable with a more robust and detailed declaration, but on the facts presented, the court cannot enter a default judgment for any amount against any defendant.
