 Case Number:  22STCV04706    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE 
 
Defendant’s
Motion for Clarification is DENIED.  
 
Discussion
 
After full briefing and a hearing, the Court on August 10, 2023, issued
a 12-page written order granting in part and denying in part the motion for
summary adjudication filed by Defendant City of Downey (“Defendant”) and denying
Defendant’s motion for summary judgment.
 
On August 25, 2023, Defendant filed a motion for clarification of
the Court’s ruling.  In the motion,
Defendant requests that the Court “reconsider or clarify” its ruling as to the
issue of constructive notice.  Plaintiff
filed an opposition on September 28, and Defendant filed a reply on October 4.
 
Defendant’s request for reconsideration is denied.  Defendant appears to disagree with the
ruling, but mere disagreement is no basis for a motion to reconsider.  Defendant presents no new facts,
circumstances, or law sufficient to support a motion for reconsideration.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).)
 
Defendant’s request for clarification is denied.  The Court found that there were triable
issues of material fact on the issue of constructive notice.  (Order, at pp. 10-12.) The Court has provided
an adequate explanation for its ruling. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subds. (f)(2) & (g).)
 
Conclusion 
 
Defendant’s
Motion for Clarification is DENIED.  
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
