Significant Statements:

(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.(c))
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to deem admitted the matters specified in the requests for admission, as the plaintiff failed to respond to the requests within the required timeframe. The court has also granted the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $460, which was calculated based on the reasonable expenses incurred by the defendant as a result of the plaintiff's failure to respond. The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to respond to the requests for admission was a misuse of the discovery process and that the defendant is entitled to monetary sanctions under Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act.
