 Case Number:  21STCV34088    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2023    Dept:  29   TENTATIVE   The motion to continue trial is GRANTED.   Legal Standard   Code Civ. Proc. § 128(a)(8) provides that the court has  the power to amend and control its process and orders so as to make them  conform to law and justice. The power to determine when a continuance should be  granted is within the discretion of the trial court. (Color-Vue, Inc. v.  Abrams (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) A trial court has wide latitude  in the matter of calendar control including the granting or denying of  continuances. (Park Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12,  18.)  The decision whether to grant a  continuance is within the trial court’s discretion and will not be disturbed on  appeal absent a clear showing of abused discretion. (Jurado v. Toys “R” Us,  Inc. (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1615, 1617.)    A party seeking a continuance of the date set for trial,  whether contested or uncontested or stipulated by the parties, must make the  request for a continuance by a noticed motion or ex parte application, with  supporting declarations. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(b).) The party must  make the motion or application as soon as reasonably practical once the  necessity for the continuance is discovered. (Ibid.)    Each request for a continuance must be considered on its  own merits according to California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(c). The  court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause  requiring the continuance.  (Cal. Rules  of Court, Rule 3.1332(c).) Good cause may be present where there is a “substitution  of trial counsel, but only where there is an affirmative showing that the  substitution is required in the interests of justice.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule  3.1332(c)(4).)  Good cause may also be  present where a party has not been unable “to obtain essential testimony,  documents, or other material evidence despite diligent efforts.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(c)(6).)     California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332 sets forth  a list of non-exhaustive factors to be analyzed when determining whether good  cause for a trial continuance is present. A court considers factors such as:  (1) the proximity of the trial date; (2) whether there was any previous continuance,  extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party; (3) the length of the  continuance requested; (4) the availability of alternative means to address the  problem that gave rise to the motion or application for a continuance; (5) the  prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;  (6) if the case is entitled to a preferential trial setting, the reasons for  that status and whether the need for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid  delay; (7) the court’s calendar and the impact of granting a continuance on  other pending trials; (8) whether trial counsel is engaged in another trial;  (9) whether all parties have stipulated to a continuance; (10) whether the  interests of justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the  matter, or by imposing conditions on the continuance; and (11) any other fact  or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or  application. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(d).)    Discussion   This  action involves an alleged slip-and-fall at Defendant’s store.  Discovery in this matter is ongoing, and Plaintiff  completed a defense medical examination on September 19, 2023.  (Lee Decl., ¶ 3.)  The parties have agreed to mediate and have  scheduled a mediation on January 22, 2024.   (Id., ¶¶ 4-7.)  The current trial  date, however, is on December 1, 2023.   The parties jointly request a continuance of the trial date to at least  April 2024 so that the parties may mediate and, if the matter is not resolved,  complete discovery prior to trial.  (Id.,  ¶¶ 5-6.)     The Court  finds that good cause exists to continue trial. Accordingly, the motion is  GRANTED.  Conclusion The Court GRANTS the parties’ joint motion to  continue trial date until at least April 2024.   The Final Status Conference and all deadlines are reset based on the new  trial date.  Final Status Conference is continued to 04/03/2024 at 10:00 AM in Department 29 at Spring 
Street Courthouse. Non-Jury Trial is continued to 04/17/2024 at 08:30 AM in Department 29 at 
Spring Street Courthouse. Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
