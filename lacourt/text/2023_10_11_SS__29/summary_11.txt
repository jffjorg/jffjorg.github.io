```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is seeking clarification on three issues related to a demurrer filed in a case involving a dangerous condition of public property. The first issue is why the parties did not engage in a mandatory meet and confer process before filing the demurrer, as required by California law. The second issue is whether the plain language of the law establishes a procedural bar to the demurrer. The third issue is how the City of La Puente could be liable for a dangerous condition of public property located outside its city limits, as the complaint does not provide a clear answer to this question. The judge is seeking input from counsel on these issues before making a final ruling.
