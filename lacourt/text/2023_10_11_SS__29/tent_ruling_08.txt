 Case Number:  21STCV35560    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2023    Dept:  29 The
Court will hear from counsel.  
Defendant
filed three motions to compel on July 10, 2023. 
Plaintiff filed a brief statement captioned as an “opposition” to the
motions on August 21, but it does not contain any substantive arguments
relating to the discovery requests at issue. 

At the
informal discovery conference on August 28, the Court discussed the issues with
counsel and continued the hearing to give the parties additional time to discuss,
and attempt to resolve, the issues. 
Nothing has been filed with the Court since that time.
