Plaintiff’s
motions to compel Defendant Jose Luis Espinoza to respond to form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production are
GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff’s
requests for sanctions are GRANTED in part.
 
Background
 
On August 4, 2021, Plaintiff Dylan Michael
Coberly (“Plaintiff”) initiated this action against Defendants Eduardo Gastelum
Corrales, and Jose Luis Espinoza for damages arising from a motor vehicle
accident. The complaint asserts causes of action for (1) negligence, (2)
negligence per se, and (3) statutory liability. 
 
On January 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed these motions
to compel discovery responses. Plaintiff now moves for orders compelling
Defendant Espinoza to serve full, complete, verified answers, without
objections, to (1) Special Interrogatories, Set One, (2) Form Interrogatories,
Set One, and (3) Request for Production of Documents, Set One. Plaintiff also
moves for sanctions. 
 
Additional discovery motions were set for
hearing on October 10, 2023. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
A
party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (a).) 
When
a party moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A
party must respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests
for production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 411.) Nor must
a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When
a party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)
In
Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery.”  Where a party or attorney
has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary
sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(a).)
Discussion
 
On October 31, 2022, Plaintiff served Demand for Production of Documents,
Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Form Interrogatories, Set One on
Defendant Espinoza. (Aziz Decls. ¶ 4 & Exhs. A.) Defendant has not served
responses. (Id., ¶¶ 5-10, Exhs. B, C.) 

 
Plaintiff need not show anything more. 
Plaintiff’s motions to compel are granted.
 
Plaintiff’s requests for sanctions are also granted in part.  Sanctions are awarded in the amount of $660
per motion, calculated as 2 hours of attorney time per motion, multiplied by
counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $300 per hour, plus the $60 filing
fee.  (See Aziz Decls., ¶ 15.)
 
Conclusion
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant Espinoza
to respond to Demand for Production of Documents, Set One, Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and Form Interrogatories, Set One. 
 
Defendant Jose Luis Espinoza is ordered to serve complete, verified, and
code-compliant responses, without objection, to Demand for Production of
Documents, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Form Interrogatories,
Set One within 30 days of notice of this order. 
 
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED in part. Defendant Espinoza
and Defendant’s counsel of record the Chavez Legal Group are ORDERED, jointly
and severally, to pay monetary sanctions to Defendant under the Civil Discovery
Act in the total amount of $1,980 within 30 days of notice of this order.  
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
