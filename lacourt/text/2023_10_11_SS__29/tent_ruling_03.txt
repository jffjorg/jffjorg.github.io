The motions
to compel are GRANTED.  The requests for
sanctions are GRANTED in part.
 
Background 
 
On June 30,
2021, Plaintiff Charlotte Woods (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against
Defendants Shant Apet and Enterprises, Inc. for negligence arising from an
automobile collision on July 5, 2019.  
 
Defendant
Shant Apet (“Defendant”) served Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One, on Plaintiff on June 1, 2023.  To date, Plaintiff has not responded to
Defendant’s discovery requests. 
 
On August
16, 2023, Defendant filed the instant motions to compel response to form
interrogatories and requests for production of documents.  Defendant also requests monetary sanctions in
the amount of $1,260 for each motion. 
The total requested is $2,520. 
The motion is made pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290
and 2030.300.  
 
No
opposition has been filed as of October 6, 2023. 
 
Legal Standard 
 
Motions to Compel
A party must respond
to interrogatories and requests for production of documents within 30 days
after service.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.260, subd. (a); 2031.260, subd. (a).)  If a party to whom interrogatories or requests
for production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling responses to the discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b);
2031.300, subd. (b).) The party also waives the right to make any objections,
including one based on privilege or work-product protection.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a);
2031.300, subd. (a).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel responses
to interrogatories or production of documents other than the cut-off on hearing
discovery motions 15 days before trial.  (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2024.020, subd. (a); 2030.290; 2031.300.)  No meet and confer efforts are required before
filing a motion to compel responses to the discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2031.300; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)
Monetary Sanctions 
Sanctions are
mandatory in connection with motions to compel responses to interrogatories and
demand for production of documents against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel unless the court “finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c); 2031.300, subd. (c).
Under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.030, subd. (a), “[t]he court may impose a monetary
sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or
any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses,
including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. . .
. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision of this title, the
court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.”¿ Failing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery is a misuse of the discovery process.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿
Discussion 
 
Here, Defendant served Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, on
Plaintiff on June 1, 2023.  (Declaration
of Destini C. Blunt ISO Interrogatories (“Blunt Decl. FROG”), ¶ 2;
Ex. “A”; Declaration
of Destini C. Blunt ISO Production of Documents (“Blunt Decl. RPD”), ¶ 2;
Ex. “A.”)  Plaintiff’s responses were
initially due by July 5, 2023.  (Blunt
Decl. FROG, ¶ 3; Blunt Decl. RPD, ¶ 3.) 
After receiving no responses, Defendant requested Plaintiff respond to
the discovery requests by July 21, 2023. 
(Blunt Decl. FROG, ¶ 4; Blunt Decl. RPD, ¶ 4.)  To date, Plaintiff has not responded to Defendant’s
discovery requests. 
(Blunt Decl. FROG, ¶ 6; Blunt Decl. RPD, ¶ 6.)  A non-responding party waives the right to
make any objections, including one based on privilege or work-product
protection.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, subd. (a); 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
 
Defendant’s
motions to compel are GRANTED.
 
Defendant
also requests monetary sanctions in
the amount of $1,260 (6 hours incurred at the hourly rate of $210) for each
motion.  Given the relatively
straightforward nature of a motion to compel initial responses to discovery,
and the economies of scale associated with preparing multiple discovery
motions, the Court awards sanctions in the reduced amount of $525 per motion (2.5
hours multiplied by the hourly rate of $210). 
Thus, the Court awards sanctions in total amount of $1,050.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c); 2031.300, subd.
(c).)  
 
Conclusion 
 
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED.

Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, and for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED.

order.
