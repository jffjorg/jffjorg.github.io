 Case Number:  21STCV31921    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE 
 
The Court GRANTS the motions of Defendant
Aremy L. Villatoro’ Lopez to compel Plaintiff to respond to Form
Interrogatories (Set One) and Special Interrogatories (Set One). 
 
The Court GRANTS the request for
monetary sanctions in part. 
 
Background 
 
On August 27, 2021, Plaintiff Sharon R. Carter
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Aremy L. Villatoro-Lopez, Damaris
Lopez-Tul, Does 1 to 100 alleging causes of action for motor vehicle and
general negligence.  The complaint arises
from an alleged automobile collision which occurred on October 26, 2019. 
 
On September 15, 2023, Defendant Aremy L. Villatoro-Lopez
(“Defendant”) filed and served these two unopposed discovery motions seeking orders
to compel Plaintiff to respond to Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Special
Interrogatories (Set One). Defendant also seeks monetary sanctions. 
 
A third discovery motion in this matter is on calendar
for hearing on October 12.
 
Legal
Standard 
 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories
are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move
for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290,
subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and
no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories,
“the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil
Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d),
defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond
to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
 
Discussion              
 
Plaintiff was
served with Defendant’s Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Special
Interrogatories (Set One), on February 17, 2023.  (Mackey Decls., ¶ 2 and Exhs. A.)  Plaintiff never served responses.  (Id., ¶¶ 3-6.)
 
Defendant need
not show anything more.  Defendant’s
motions to compel are granted.
 
Defendant’s
request for sanctions is granted in part. 
Given the relatively straightforward nature of a motion to compel
initial responses, and the economies of scale associated with preparing
multiple discovery motions in the same case, the Court awards monetary
sanctions in the amount of $310 per motion, calculated as 2 hours per motion,
multiplied by counsel’s billing rate of $125.00 per hour, plus a $60.00 filing
fee.  (See id., ¶ 7.)  
 
Conclusion 
 
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s
motions to compel. 
 
Plaintiff is ORDERED to serve
complete, verified, and code-complaint responses, without objection, to Defendant’s
Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Special Interrogatories (Set One) within 30
days of notice of this order. 
 
Defendant’s request for monetary
sanctions is GRANTED in part.  Plaintiff
is ORDERED to pay monetary sanctions to Defendant in the total amount of $620
within 30 days of notice of this order. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
