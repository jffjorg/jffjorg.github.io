 Case Number:  21STCV36936    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE 
 
Defendant’s Motion for an order deeming
admitted the matters specified in Requests for Admission is GRANTED.  
 
Defendant’s request for sanctions is GRANTED.
 
Background 
 
On October
6, 2021, Plaintiff Denise Chow (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against
Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority
(“Defendant”) for motor vehicle and general negligence.  On April 28, 2023, Defendant filed its
answer.    
 
On May 26,
2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with Requests for Admission (Set One).  Plaintiff’s responses to discovery were due
by June 31, 2023.  Plaintiff did not
respond. 
 
On
September 7, 2023, Defendant filed the instant motion for an order establishing
admissions against Plaintiff and for sanctions. 
Plaintiff did not file an opposition. 
 
Legal Standard 
 
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
that the truth of the matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted. (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for such a motion, and no meet
and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2033.280; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the matters contained in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a
party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may
impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(a).)
Discussion 
Defendant
served Plaintiff with Requests for Admission (Set One) on May 26, 2023.  (Declaration of Melanie O. Paulick, ¶ 6; Ex. “A.”)  Plaintiff’s responses were due by June 31,
2023.  (Paulick Decl., ¶ 6.)  To date, Plaintiff has not responded to
Defendants Requests for Admission and did not request an extension.  (Paulick Decl., ¶ 7.)  
 
Defendant need show nothing more.  The motion to deem admitted the matters
specified in Requests For Admission (Set One) is GRANTED.
The Court also GRANTS Defendant’s
request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $460, calculated as 2 hours of
work multiplied by counsel’s rate of $230 per hour.  (Paulick Decl., ¶¶ 8-9.)  ¿
Conclusion 
 
Defendant’s motion is GRANTED.  The Court DEEMS ADMITTED the matters
specified in Defendant’s Requests for Admission (Set One).
 
Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions is
GRANTED.  Plaintiff and counsel of record the Sardarbegian Law
Offices are ORDERED, jointly and severally, to pay monetary sanctions to Defendant in the amount
of $460 within 30 days of notice of this order.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
