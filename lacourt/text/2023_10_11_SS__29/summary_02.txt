And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the parties' joint motion to continue the trial date. The trial was originally set for October 26, 2023, but the parties need more time to conduct critical discovery, including deposing a critical liability witness and obtaining police officers' dash camera footage. The judge finds that good cause exists to continue the trial, as the parties have engaged new counsel and need more time to prepare for trial. The parties are only requesting a short continuance of three months, and the judge has elected to continue the trial to allow them to obtain their necessary discovery.
