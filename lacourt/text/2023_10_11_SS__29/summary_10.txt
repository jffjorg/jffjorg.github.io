And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendant's Motion for Clarification. The Defendant had sought to clarify the Court's ruling on the issue of constructive notice, which was part of a larger motion for summary adjudication and summary judgment. The Court had previously ruled that there were triable issues of material fact on this issue, and the Defendant has presented no new facts, circumstances, or law to support its motion for clarification. The Judge has denied the motion, citing California Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 and 437c. The Defendant's motion for reconsideration is also denied, as mere disagreement with the ruling is not sufficient grounds for reconsideration. The Court's written order is final, and the Defendant is ordered to give notice.
