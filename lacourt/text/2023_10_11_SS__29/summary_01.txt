And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 19STCV36242, in which the City of Los Angeles (Defendant) has moved for summary judgment. The Court has determined that the Plaintiff's Separate Statement in Opposition to the motion is defective and has ordered the Plaintiff to file and serve a corrected Separate Statement by October 18, 2023. The corrected statement must clearly state whether each fact is disputed or undisputed and provide adequate references to supporting evidence. The Court has also warned the Plaintiff that failure to comply with these requirements may result in the motion for summary judgment being granted. Additionally, the Court has given the Defendant the option to file a further reply to any revisions or corrections made by the Plaintiff to its Separate Statement, but this is not required.
