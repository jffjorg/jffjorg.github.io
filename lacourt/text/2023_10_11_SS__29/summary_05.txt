And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted Defendant Aremy L. Villatoro-Lopez's motions to compel Plaintiff Sharon R. Carter to respond to Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Special Interrogatories (Set One). Additionally, the Court has granted Defendant's request for monetary sanctions in part, ordering Plaintiff to pay $620 in sanctions. The Court's ruling is based on the fact that Plaintiff failed to respond to Defendant's discovery requests, which is a violation of California Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.260, subd. (a). The Court has also taken into account the fact that Defendant's motions were unopposed and that the Plaintiff failed to provide a timely response.
