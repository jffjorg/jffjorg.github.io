Payments, Inc.'s opposition brief. The court finds that the information in the amended identification of trade secrets may constitute or describe the Plaintiff's trade secrets and therefore grants the motion as to those portions. The court also grants the motion as to certain portions of the defendant's opposition brief that quote or describe information set forth in the amended identification of trade secrets. The court denies the motion as to the information set forth in all other redacted paragraphs. The court orders the Plaintiff to file a revised public redacted version of the opposition brief by February 23, 2024, and directs the clerk to file the order and maintain the sealed records in a secure manner.
