MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Forex Express Corp.,
d/b/a WireCash          
 
RESPONDING PARTIES:    Defendant Eliran Grushkowsky (joined by (1)
defendant Fernando Fayzano on January 24, 2024, and (2) defendants Inter &
Co. Payments, Inc., and Inter & Co., Inc. on January 24, 2024)
Motion for Order to Seal Amended Identification of Trade Secrets
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Forex Express Corp.,
d/b/a WireCash (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order sealing (1)
Plaintiff’s Amended Identification of Trade Secrets, attached as Exhibit 3 to
the “Declaration of Elliot Z. Chen”, filed by defendant Eliran Grushkowsky
(“Defendant”) in support of his opposition to Plaintiff’s motion to seal on
November 21, 2023, and (2) portions of Defendant’s opposition to Plaintiff’s
motion to seal, filed on November 21, 2023. 
In light of the court’s January 25, 2024 order, Plaintiff now moves for
an order sealing (1) the portions of the Amended Identification of Trade
Secrets that were ordered sealed in that order, and (2) the following portions
of Defendant’s opposition papers: (i) page 7, lines 26-27, (ii) page 9, lines
3-8 (right column), 20-23 (right column), and 27-28,  (iii) page 10, lines 7-10 (right column),          (iv) page 11, lines 12-15 and 17-21,
(v) page 12, lines 1 and 2, (vi) page 13, lines 15-1 and 21-23, and (vii) page
16, lines 12-18.  (Reilly Decl.,
¶¶ 3-4; Reply, p. 3:13-14.) 
Generally,
court records are presumed to be open unless confidentiality is required by
law.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550, subd. (c).)¿ If the presumption of
access applies, the court may order that a record be filed under seal “if it
expressly finds facts that establish: (1) There exists an overriding interest
that overcomes the right of public access to the record; (2) The overriding
interest supports sealing the record; (3) A substantial probability exists that
the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) The
proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) No less restrictive means exist
to achieve the overriding interest.”¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550, subd.
(d).)¿¿¿¿¿ 
The court
finds, as to the Amended Identification of Trade Secrets, that (1) there exists
an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the
information set forth on        (i) page
2, between lines 19-28, through page 3, lines 1-27, (ii) page 4, between lines
20-27 (but excluding the last sentence of paragraph 5, subdivision (b)), (iii)
page 5, between lines 16-21, (iv) page 6, between lines 4-10, (v) page 6,
between lines 14-16, (vi) page 6, between lines 24-28, through page 7, lines
1-2 (but excluding the last sentence of paragraph 10), and (vii) page 7, between
lines 3-7 (but excluding the last sentence of paragraph 11 as set forth between
the lines 6-8), because the information set forth therein includes content that
may constitute or describe Plaintiff’s trade secrets; (2) the overriding
interest supports sealing the record to preserve the confidentiality of this
information; (3) a substantial probability exists that the overriding interest
will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) the proposed sealing is
narrowly tailored; and (5) no less restrictive means exist to achieve the
overriding interest.  (Cal. Rules of Ct.,
rule 2.550, subd. (d).)  The court
therefore grants Plaintiff’s motion as to those portions of the Amended
Identification of Trade Secrets. 
The court
finds, as to Defendant’s opposition brief, that (1) there exists an overriding
interest that overcomes the right of public access to the information set forth
on (i) page 9, lines 3-8 (right column), and (ii) page 10, lines
7-10 (right column), because that information quotes or describes information
set forth in the Amended Identification of Trade Secrets that the court has
determined may constitute Plaintiff’s trade secrets; (2) the overriding interest supports
sealing the record; (3) a substantial probability exists that the overriding
interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) the proposed
sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) no less restrictive means exist to
achieve the overriding interest.  (Cal.
Rules of Ct., rule 2.550, subd. (d).) 
The court therefore grants Plaintiff’s motion as to those portions of
Defendant’s opposition.  The court denies
Plaintiff’s motion as to the information set forth in all other redacted
paragraphs. 
ORDER
            The court grants in part plaintiff
Forex Express Corp., d/b/a WireCash’s motion for order to seal amended
identification of trade secrets as follows. 
            The court orders that the unredacted
version of “Defendant Eliran Grushkowsky’s Opposition to Plaintiff Forex
Express Corp.’s Motion for Order to Seal Plaintiff’s Amended Identification of
Trade Secrets,” lodged with the court on November 21, 2023 by defendant Eliran
Grushkowsky, shall be filed under seal. 
            The court orders plaintiff Forex
Express Corp., d/b/a WireCash to file a revised public redacted version of
“Defendant Eliran Grushkowsky’s Opposition to Plaintiff Forex Express Corp.’s
Motion for Order to Seal Plaintiff’s Amended Identification of Trade Secrets” that
       (1) includes a cover identifying
it as “Public—Redacts materials from sealed record,” and           (2) redacts the portions of the
opposition brief and the Amended Identification of Trade Secrets (as attached
as Exhibit 3 to the “Declaration of Elliot Z. Chen”) in a manner that is
consistent with the order set forth above, by no later than February 23, 2024. 
            Pursuant to California Rules of
Court, rule 2.551, subdivision (e), the court directs the clerk to file this
order, maintain the records ordered sealed in a secure manner, and clearly
identify the records as sealed by this order. 
            The court orders plaintiff Forex
Express Corp., d/b/a WireCash to give notice of this ruling. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  February 6, 2024
