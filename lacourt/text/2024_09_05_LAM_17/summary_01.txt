And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case between Edward A. Klein (Petitioner) and Wal-Mart.com USA, LLC (Respondent) regarding the confirmation of an arbitration award. The Petitioner has moved to confirm the arbitration award and for attorney fees or to vacate the award and remand the case. The Respondent has also petitioned the court to confirm the arbitration award. The judge has denied the Petitioner's petition and granted the Respondent's petition. The judge has also awarded the Petitioner reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees and costs, under CCP 1281.99(a) in the amount of $0. The dispute in this case concerns the scope of fees and costs recoverable by the Petitioner as a result of the Respondent's late payment of arbitral fees. The judge has ruled that the Petitioner has not shown any fees or costs incurred as a result of the Respondent's material breach, and therefore has not awarded any fees or costs related to the arbitration.
