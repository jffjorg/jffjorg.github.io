 Hearing
  Date:  September 5, 2024




 
Respondent’s
petition to confirm the Final Award is GRANTED. Petitioner’s petition is
DENIED. 
 
Petitioner is
denied fees and costs “related to the arbitration,” and is awarded reasonable
expenses incurred, including attorney’s fees and costs, under CCP 1281.99(a) in
the amount of $0. 
 
On 8/16/2023,
Edward A. Klein (Petitioner) petitioned this Court to confirm an arbitration
award entered in favor of it against Wal-Mart.com USA, LLC (Respondent). 
 
Then on
12/18/2023, Petitioner moved to confirm arbitration award and for attorney fees
or vacate award and remand case. 
 
Concurrently,
Respondent petitioned the Court to confirm the arbitration award. 
 
Legal Standard 
 
An
arbitration award is not directly enforceable until it is confirmed by a court
and judgment is entered. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1287.6; Jones v. Kvistad (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 836, 840.) A party who is
satisfied with an arbitration award should move to confirm the award. 
 
A petition to confirm an arbitration award must include the substance of
the agreement to arbitrate, the names of the arbitrators, and the opinion of
the arbitrator. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4. The general rule is that a court
will not review “the merits of the controversy, the validity of the
arbitrator’s reasoning, or the sufficiency of the evidence.” (Jordan v. DMV (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 43;
see also Dept. of Personnel Admin. v.
Cal. Correctional Peace Officers Ass'n (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 1193,
1200 [“an arbitrator’s decision is not generally reviewable for errors of fact
or law, whether or not such error appears on the face of the award and causes
substantial injustice to the parties.”].) Confirmation of the award is
mandatory unless a response or petition to correct or vacate the award has been
timely filed. (See Code Civ. Proc. §
1286; Valsan Partners Limited Partnership
v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 809, 818)
 
Discussion 
 
             On May 8, 2023, Judge Lucky issued a “Final
Award” in the Arbitration (Initial Award). In the First Award, Judge Lucky
summarized his decision as follows: “the Arbitrator finds that Walmart did not
violate the UCL or FAL. However, because Walmart did not timely pay initial
arbitration fees, Walmart has materially breached the [arbitration agreement]
under Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) §1281.97.” 
 
On May 15,
2023, Respondent requested that Judge Lucky correct the First Award. On June 9,
2023, Judge Lucky issued a corrected final arbitration award (Amended Award).
 
Now,
Petitioner requests that Court confirm the Award for attorney’s fees and costs
under CCP 1281.97—specifically section 1281.97(b)(2).
 
In opposition,
Respondent argues that the Arbitrator awarded nothing to Klein under this
provision. Rather, Respondent argues that the Arbitrator directed that Klein
seek any “sanctions in court under CCP 1281.99,” and specifically “that the
court must impose any remedy . . . under 1281.99(a).” (Id., §12, ¶4; §
11.) 
 
CCP §1281.99(a)
is much narrower than section 1281.97(b)(2) and, by its plain language, is
limited to only those fees and costs which arise directly from the material
breach (here, the alleged late JAMS payment). As such, the disagreement here
concerns the scope of fees and costs which can be recovered by Petitioner as a
result of Respondent’s late payment. 
 
            Here,
the Arbitrator’s ruling is clear: Wal-Mart was “in material breach” of CCP
section 1281.97 and that “Klein must seek his sanctions in court under CCP
1281.99.” (See Complaint, p. 47, Exh. B., p. 15.) 
 
            CCP
section 1281.99 provides: 
 
The court shall impose a monetary sanction against a drafting
party that materially breaches an arbitration agreement pursuant to subdivision
(a) of Section 1281.97 or subdivision (a) of Section 1281.98, by ordering the
drafting party to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees and
costs, incurred by the employee or consumer as a result of the material
breach.
 
            (emphasis added.) 
 
            By its express terms, CCP section
1281.99 provides for the recovery of those fees incurred as a result of the
breach, rather than provides for a recovery of all related attorney fees
incurred in arbitration. As such, there must be a clear causal
connection between the material breach and the fees or costs incurred, and
other fees incurred in connection with the arbitration are not recoverable. 
 
The case law reflects this. (See
Costa v. Melikov, No. CV 2:20-09467-AB-ASx, 2022 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 198692, at *13 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 21, 2022) (finding that the costs
arising “as a result of the material breach” do not include the initial
arbitration-related litigation but rather the costs of responding to the
defendant’s failure to pay the initial fee that resulted in closure of the
arbitration); see also Stokes v. SBS Transp., LLC, No. 20-cv-02086-JSW,
2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6022, at *4-6 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 12, 2023) (limiting
allowable fees under section 1281.99(a) to those incurred in the motion to
vacate an order compelling arbitration and the arbitration fee, and excluding
the fees for responding to the initial motion to compel arbitration). Because
the statutory language is unambiguous on its face, specifying a “material
breach” and “as a result of the material breach”, the plain meaning of the
statutory language governs. De Leon v. Juanita’s Foods, 85 Cal. App. 5th
740, 750 (2022) (citing People v. Lopez, 31 Cal. 4th 1051, 1056
(2003)). 
 
Here,
Respondent’s payment of arbitral fees was two days late. Klein has not
presented any evidence of expenses, including attorney’s fees and costs,
incurred between August 23, 2021 and August 25, 2021, as a result of Walmart’s
purported delay in paying the initial fee. No such evidence is cited in the
Award, it does not appear in the arbitral record, and it is not alleged in
Klein’s Petition. Petitioner did not move to compel arbitration during that
two-day delay nor did JAMS close the arbitration or assess any fees against
Klein as a result of the payment’s timing. 
 
As such,
Petitioner has not shown any fees or costs incurred as a result of Respondent’s
material breach. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Respondent’s petition to confirm the Final Award is granted.
Petitioner’s petition is denied. Petitioner is denied fees and costs “related
to the arbitration,” and is awarded reasonable expenses, including attorney’s
fees and costs, under CCP 1281.99(a) in the amount of $0. 
 
It is so ordered.
