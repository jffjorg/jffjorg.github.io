And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Esther Chao to Plaintiff Michele Santopietro's Second Amended Complaint. The judge has found that Defendant's demurrer to the Eleventh and Fourteenth Causes of Action for Negligent Misrepresentation and Fraud by Concealment is overruled, as Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to maintain these causes of action. However, the judge has sustained Defendant's demurrer to the Thirteenth Cause of Action for Constructive Eviction, as the allegations in the complaint are unclear and contradictory regarding when and how the constructive eviction occurred. The judge has granted Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to address these issues.
