And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The defendant, Linda J. Maultsby, claims she was improperly served by mailing and posting a copy of the summons and complaint. However, the plaintiff, Mural Media, LLC 401K Plan, claims that Maultsby was served via substitute service on September 10, 2023, after three attempts at personal service. The proof of service filed by the plaintiff indicates that the process server left a copy of the summons and complaint at Maultsby's dwelling house with a competent member of the household, and mailed a copy of the summons and complaint to Maultsby's residence on September 14, 2023. The judge found that the process server made a reasonable number of attempts at personal service and that the proof of service is prima facie evidence of the completion of service on Maultsby. The defendant's evidence, which consisted of an assertion that no one matching the description of the woman served by substitute service lives with her, was insufficient to rebut the presumption of the facts contained in the proof of service. Therefore, the judge denied the defendant's motion to quash service of summons and ordered Maultsby to file a responsive pleading within 5 days of service of notice of the order.
