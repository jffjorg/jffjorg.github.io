 Case Number:  20STCV11891    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2023    Dept:  68 Motion to Tax Costs on Appeal
Roy Rios vs. Webroot Inc., 20STCV11891
Moving Party: Plaintiff Roy Rios

Responding Party: Defendant
Webroot Inc.

Background
            Defendant
Webroot Inc. filed a memorandum of costs on appeal for total costs of $2,972.44.
Plaintiff Roy Rios (Plaintiff) filed this motion to tax costs on appeal
pursuant to Cal. Rules of Court 3.7100(b), 8.278(d) and CCP § 1034(b). In
Plaintiff’s Reply, Plaintiff indicates that he only wishes to tax the $2,850.94
for printing and copy of briefs and the $72 for preparation of the original and
copies of clerk’s transcript or appendix. He no longer disputes the $49.50 for filing
fees after Defendant provided invoices for the filing fees.
            Plaintiff
argues that the $2,850.94 for printing and copying of briefs is grossly
excessive because Defendant used a third party to print and copy the briefs, as
well as prepare, format, serve, and mail them. Plaintiff argues that these were
not costs that were necessarily incurred, and that Defendant never served any
paper copies of briefs on Plaintiff. Defendant argues in its opposition that
these costs were for the four separate briefs that it filed with the Court of
Appeal.
            Plaintiff
also argues that the $72 for preparation of the original and copies of clerk’s
transcript or appendix should be taxed because no party obtained such a
transcript during the appeal process, and Defendant has failed to provide an
invoice for any such transcript. Defendant claims in its opposition that the
transcript was a trial court transcript, but it does not substantiate this
claim.
Analysis
Rule of Court 8.278(d)(1) specifies
certain recoverable costs on appeal, “if reasonable”. “[I]f the items are
properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the
party claiming them as costs.” (Ladas v. California State Auto. Ass’n
(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.)
CCP § 1033.5(c) states that
allowable costs shall be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation
and shall be reasonable in amount.
There is no indication that the $72
for original and copies of the court transcript were reasonably necessary to
the litigation, nor has Defendant provided any evidence of where this number
comes from. The Court taxes the $72 requested for the transcript.
As for the $2,850.94 for the
printing and copying of briefs, Defendant has argued that it was necessary
because it was for the briefs that were sent to the Court of Appeal. Defendant
provided invoices for this amount, attached as Exhibits A and B to the
Christiansen Declaration. However, the amount requested by Defendant does not
appear to be reasonable. Defendant could have prepared, formatted, served,
printed, and mailed the documents itself. Instead, it used a third party
service to do this. While the Court is inclined to award some of the costs for
this, the $2,850.94 that was requested is not reasonable. The Court will award
$2,140 for this request, meaning that these costs are taxed by $710.94. The
Court deducted the costs from the invoices that were for “electronic bookmarks,”
“electronic services,” and “electronic filing”, as well as shipping and
handling and service of documents. Defendant did not make a separate request
for costs for these things, only for the printing and copying of the briefs.
Defendant could have included the costs for filing under the category for
filing fees in the memorandum of costs, but it did not.
The Court taxes Defendant’s
memorandum of costs in the amount of $782.94 for the $72 and the $710.94.
Order
            Plaintiff’s
motion to tax costs is granted in the amount of $782.94.
