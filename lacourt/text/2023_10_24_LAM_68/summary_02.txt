The Plaintiff filed a motion to tax costs, objecting to certain items on the basis that they were not reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation. The Judge has granted the motion to tax costs in the amount of $782.94, which includes $72 for the preparation of a transcript that was not reasonably necessary and $710.94 for printing and copying of briefs that was excessive. The Judge has awarded $2,140 for the printing and copying of briefs, which is the amount that is deemed reasonable. The Judge has deducted the costs from the invoices that were for electronic services, shipping and handling, and service of documents, as these costs were not separately requested by the Defendant.
