Background
Pleadings
Plaintiff Janet Weiss—individually
and as trustee of the Janet Weiss Separate Property Trust Dated August 10, 2020—sues
Defendants Nurbeh Baravarian and Does 1 through 20 pursuant to a June 6, 2022
Complaint alleging claims of (1) IIED/NIED, (2) Violation of Easement, (3)
Violation of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, and (4) Negligence.
The claims arise from the following
allegations. Plaintiff Weiss owns Unit 705 at 321 North Oakhurst, Beverly
Hills, California (the Weiss Condo; the Condominium Project). Plaintiff Weiss’s
downstairs neighbor at Unit 605 is Defendant Baravarian (the Baravarian Condo).
In violation of the Condominium Project’s Covenants, Codes, and Restrictions
(CC&Rs), Defendant Baravarian refused to permit Plaintiff Weiss rightful
access to a bathroom in Defendant Baravarian’s condominium unit to effect a
repair on a leaking water pipe housed between the Weiss Condo and the
Baravarian Condo, which was more accessible through Defendant Baravarian’s unit
as opposed to Plaintiff Weiss’s adjoining upstairs unit, resulting in damages
to Plaintiff Weiss.
Motion to Compel Further
Responses
On November 11, 2023, Plaintiff
Weiss filed (1) a motion to compel further admission responses to Plaintiff’s Requests
for Admission, Set One (RFAs, Set One), Nos. 1-80 from Defendant Baravarian (2)
a motion to compel further admission responses to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories, Set Two (FROGs, Set Two), Nos. 22.7 and 17.1 from Defendant
Baravarian, and (3) a motion to compel further admission responses to
Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One (RPDs, Set One), Nos.
50-55 from Defendant Baravarian.
The motions also request monetary sanctions
against Defendant Baravarian and counsel.
On February 20, 2024, Defendant
Baravarian filed oppositions to Plaintiff Weiss’s motions.
On February 26, 2024, Plaintiff
Weiss filed replies to Defendant Baravarian’s oppositions.
Plaintiff Weiss’s motions are now
before the Court.
 
Motion
to Compel Further Responses
Legal
Standard
A
motion to compel a further response is used when a party gives unsatisfactory
answers or makes untenable objections to interrogatories, demands to produce,
or requests for admission. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (a),
2031.310, subd. (a), 2033.290, subd. (a).)
To
obtain further responses to requests for admission, the movant must establish
that (1) the response to an RFA is evasive or incomplete (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.290, subd. (a)(1)) or (2) the objection to an RFA is without merit or too
general (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (a)(2)).
To
compel a further response to interrogatories, the movant can show that: (1) the
responding party’s answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(1)); (2) the responding
party’s exercise of the option to produce documents in response to an
interrogatory was unwarranted or the required specification of those documents
was inadequate (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(2)); and (3) the
responding party’s objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too
general (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(3); see, e.g., Williams v.
Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 550 (Williams) [defendant’s
argument that plaintiff was required to establish good cause or prove merits of
underlying claim before propounding interrogatories without merit]).
To
request further production, a movant must establish: (1) good cause for the
production (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1); Sinaiko, supra,
at p. 403); and (2) that a further response is needed because (a) the
responding party’s statement of compliance with the demand to produce is
incomplete Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(1)), (b) the responding
party’s representation that it is unable to comply is inadequate, complete, or
evasive (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(2)), (c) the responding party’s
objection in the response is without merit or is too general (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (a)(3); Catalina Island Yacht Club v. Superior Court
(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1127 (Catalina Island)), or (d) if the
responding party objected to the production of ESI on the ground that it is not
reasonably accessible the movant can show that the (i) ESI is reasonably
accessible or (ii) there is good cause for production of the ESI regardless of
its accessibility (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (e)).
Orders
Compelling Further Responses: DENIED AS MOOT.
After
review, the Court determines that Defendant Baravarian’s December 4, 2023
supplemental responses to RFAs, Set One, Nos. 1-80 and December 12, 2023
supplemental responses to FROGs, Set Two, Nos. 22.7 and 17.1, and RPDs, Set
Two, Nos. 50-55, served by Defendant Baravarian on Plaintiff Weiss mooted Plaintiff
Weiss’s motions. (Opp’ns, Mandell Decl., Ex. D.)
A
motion to compel further responses was the proper method of challenging those supplemental
admission, interrogatory, and production responses. As of the December 6, 2023
Informal Discovery Conference (IDC), the parties were aware that the November
9, 2023 responses would be served by Defendant Baravarian by December 20, 2023.
(Mot., Mandell Decl., Ex. C, p. 1.) The time window to file motions to compel
further responses expired on Monday, January 22, 2024 for the RFA responses,
and on Tuesday, January 30, 2024 for the interrogatory and production
responses. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 10, 12, 12a, 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B),
2030.300, subd. (c), 2031.310, subd. (c), 2033.290, subd. (c); see Opp’ns,
Mandell Decl., Ex. D, Proof of Service [service via email].)
Plaintiff’s
motions are therefore DENIED AS MOOT as to compelling further responses to RFAs,
Set One, Nos. 1-80, FROGs, Set Two, Nos. 22.7 and 17.1, and RPDs, Set Two, Nos.
50-55.

Orders Granting Sanctions: DENIED.

The Court must impose monetary
sanctions against anyone (party, non-party, or attorney) who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel further responses to requests for
admission, unless it finds that the person to be sanctioned acted with substantial
justification or other circumstances make the imposition of sanctions unjust.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2033.290, subd. (d); § 2030.300, subd. (d), § 2031.310,
subd. (h).).)
The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
Here, while Defendant Baravarian served
supplemental responses on December 4, 2023 and December 12, 2023 (Opp’ns,
Mandell Decl., Ex. D, Proofs of Service), this took place 56 and 64 days after
Defendants’ Baravarian’s service of the October 9, 2023 objection-only
responses to RFAs, Set One, Nos. 1-80, FROGs, Set Two, Nos. 22.7 and 17.1, and
RPDs, Set Two, Nos. 50-55. (Mots., Jaroscak Decl., Ex. B, Proofs of Service.)
This service was effected beyond what would have been the statutory timeframe for
motions to compel further responses had the October 9th responses been verified
and contained substantive responses. (Mots., Jaroscak Decl., Ex. B [unverified
objection-only responses]; Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2033.290, subd. (c), 2030.300,
subd. (c), 2031.310, subd. (c).)
However, while the October 9th responses
were not verified and did not contain substantive responses (Mots., Jaroscak
Decl., Ex. B [unverified objection-only responses]), the parties were aware as
of the December 6, 2023 IDC that verified responses would be served by
Defendant Baravarian by December 20, 2023 (Opp’n, Mandell Decl., Ex. C, p. 1),
and the statutory period to compel further responses was triggered as of
December 4, 2023 (Opp’ns, Mandell Decl., Ex. D), thus expiring on Monday,
January 22, 2024 for the RFA responses, and on Tuesday, January 30, 2024 for
the interrogatory and production responses. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 10, 12,
12a, 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B), 2030.300, subd. (c), 2031.310, subd. (c), 2033.290,
subd. (c); see Opp’ns, Mandell Decl., Ex. D, Proof of Service [service via
email].)
Under these circumstances, the
Court determines that sanctions would be unjust. The most proper response would
have been for Plaintiff Weiss to file a motion to compel further responses
after the service of the supplemental responses within the statutory window and
thus preserve her rights. It would be unjust to impose sanctions for late
responses to RFAs, FROGs, and RPDs, Set One, under circumstances where
Plaintiff Weiss herself was dilatory in enforcing her rights to sufficient supplemental
responses to RFAs, Set One, Nos. 1-80, FROGs, Set Two, Nos. 22.7 and 17.1, and
RPDs, Set Two, Nos. 50-55.
To conclude, while the Court does not
condone Defendant’s tardy filing of responses after a motion to compel has been
filed, neither does it condone Plaintiff’s counsel’s failure to provide a requested
one-week courtesy extension of time (without conditions) or failure to take
this motion off calendar and file one tailored to the responses actually
provided.
