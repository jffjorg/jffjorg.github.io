Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on three motions filed by the plaintiff, Janet Weiss, to compel further responses to requests for admission, interrogatories, and requests for production. The motions seek sanctions of $2,439.98, $2,054.98, and $2,374.98 against the defendant, Nurbeh Baravarian, and his counsel, Barbara Mandell.

The judge ruled that the motions are denied as moot because the defendant has already provided supplemental responses to the requests. The judge found that the supplemental responses were served beyond the statutory timeframe for motions to compel further responses, but the parties were aware of the deadline and had agreed to extend it.

The judge also denied the motions for sanctions, finding that imposing sanctions would be unjust in this case. The judge noted that the defendant's tardy filing of responses was not condoned, but neither was the plaintiff's counsel's failure to provide a requested one-week courtesy extension or to take the motion off calendar and file a new one tailored to the responses actually provided.

The judge's ruling is tentative and subject to change after oral argument and written submissions.
