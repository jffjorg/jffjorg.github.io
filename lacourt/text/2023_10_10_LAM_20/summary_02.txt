And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Kevin C. Brazile, has granted the motions to relieve counsel Felicia Mobley as counsel of record for the plaintiffs, Dr. Jynona Norwood and Family Christian Cathedral. The motions were unopposed, and the court found that they meet all the requirements of Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362. However, the court notes that counsel made a mistake in marking Dr. Jynona Norwood as a corporation rather than an individual, and failed to identify all upcoming hearings and list the address of the Court in all items. Despite these errors, the court excuses the failures and grants the motions. The court also sets an OSC Re: Representation for fourteen days from the hearing, at which time Family Christian Cathedral must appear with substitute counsel and update the court on their readiness to proceed to trial.
