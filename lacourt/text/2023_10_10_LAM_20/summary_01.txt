And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions against the plaintiff. The plaintiff, Joshua Espinoza, failed to provide discovery responses despite being ordered to do so. The defendant, Rosecrans Avenue Property, LLC, sought sanctions due to the plaintiff's misuse of the discovery process. The judge considered the facts and laws and decided that terminating sanctions are appropriate, as the plaintiff's actions cannot be vindicated through less severe sanctions. The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030, which authorize a range of penalties for conduct amounting to misuse of the discovery process. The plaintiff's pleading is stricken with respect to the defendant, and the judge will not award additional monetary sanctions.
