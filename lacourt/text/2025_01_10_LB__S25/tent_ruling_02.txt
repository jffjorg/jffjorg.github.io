 Case Number:  24LBCV00507    Hearing Date:   January 10, 2025    Dept:  S25 Procedural BackgroundOn March 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant Doe Company and Does 1 to 50, alleging the following causes of action:1. Strict Product Liability – Manufacturing Defect2. Strict Product Liability – Defect Design3. Strict Product Liability – Failure to Warn4. Negligent Product LiabilityPlaintiff alleges that on or about August 30, 2022, at approximately 9:30 a.m., while Plaintiff was in the process of sorting cardboard and other paper products on the conveyor belt of the SORTER, she rested her foot on part of the machine and one of the recycling bins connected to the SORTER when full automatically retracted, severely crushing Plaintiff’s left foot. (Compl., ¶ 12.) On July 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed an amendment to the complaint, substituting Doe Company with CP Manufacturing, Inc. (July 25, 2024 Amendment to Complaint.)On October 4, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion to strike portions of the complaint. On December 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On December 30, 2024, the Court, on its own motion, continued the instant motion hearing to January 10, 2025. That same day, Defendant filed a reply.Legal StandardA party may move to strike matters from an opposing party’s pleading if it is irrelevant, false or improper. (See Code Civ. Proc. §§ 435, 436, subd. (a).) Motion to strike may also target all or any part of pleadings not filed or drawn in conformity with the applicable laws, rules or orders. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (b).) A Motion to Strike is the proper procedure for testing the adequacy of a punitive damages allegation because punitive damages are not a cause of action. (Grieves v. Superior Ct. (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 164.)To obtain punitive damages in an action for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract, a plaintiff must demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that the defendant is guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a).) The clear and convincing evidence standard “requires a finding of high probability . . . ‘so clear as to leave no substantial doubt’; sufficiently strong to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.” (Lackner v. North (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1188, 1211.)“Oppression” is defined as “despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.” (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(2).) "[D]espicable” connotes conduct that is ". . . so vile, base, contemptible, miserable, wretched or loathsome that it would be looked down upon and despised by ordinary decent people.” (Lackner, supra, 135 Cal.App.4th at p. 1210.) “Fraud” is defined as “an intentional misrepresentation, deceit or concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.” (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(3).) “Malice” is defined as “conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(1).) “Not only must there by circumstances of oppression, fraud or malice, but facts must be alleged in the pleading to support such a claim.” (Grieves, supra, 157 Cal.App.3d at p. 166.)Meet and ConferThe requirements are satisfied. (Jin Decl., ¶¶ 6-9; Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5, subd. (a)(2) & (3).)Parties’ ArgumentsDefendant moves to strike the following portions of the complaint: (1) Page 7, ¶ 34, (2) Page 9, ¶ 46, (3) Page 10, ¶ 55, (4) Page 12, Prayer for Relief item 3.Defendant argues that language for punitive damages should be stricken from the complaint because the complaint fails to allege with factual specificity (1) what the defendant knew about the alleged acts that harmed Plaintiff, (2) how the Defendant knew it, and (3) the manner in which the Defendant consciously disregarded Plaintiff’s right or safety despite its knowledge. (G. D. Searle & Co. v. Superior Court (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 22, 32-33.) Defendant adds that the complaint does not allege that Defendant acted with malicious intent and engaged in conduct designed to injure Plaintiff. (See Flyer's Body Shop Profit Sharing Plan v. Ticor Title Ins. Co. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 1149, 1154-1155 [something “more than the mere commission of a tort is always required for punitive damages...to establish malice, it is not sufficient to only show that the defendant's conduct was negligent, grossly negligent or even reckless.”])In opposition, Plaintiff contends that the complaint adequately pleads for punitive damages. First, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant mischaracterizes malice in a products liability action. (See Pfeifer v. Jone Crane, Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1299 [malice “does not require actual intent to harm . . . Conscious disregard for the safety of another may be sufficient where the defendant is aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his or her conduct and he or she willfully fails to avoid such consequences.”]) Plaintiff analogizes the present action to Pfeifer, wherein the Appellate Court finding that defendant “knew that users replaced gaskets using methods that created asbestos dust or fragmented old gaskets, yet it never tested its products to determine whether those methods generated concentrations of asbestos fibers exceeding regulatory limits” and such evidence was sufficient to uphold the jury’s verdict of punitive damages. (Pfeifer v. Jone Crane, Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1300-1301.) Plaintiff further adds that the Occupational Safety and Health Standards 1910.212(a)(3)(iii) requires point of operation guarding on machines to protect employees from a serious risk of injury, pointing particularly to its requirement that any “point of operation of machines whose operation exposes an employee to injury, shall be guarded.” Plaintiff asserts that Defendant’s failure to comply with these regulations demonstrates conscious disregard for public safety, thereby warranting punitive damages.In reply, Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s allegations are conclusory and lack the specificity to demonstrate malice or conscious disregard, adding that no facts suggest Defendant intentionally omitted a safety guard or deliberately ignored known hazard. (Grieves v. Superior Court (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 166 [“The mere allegation an intentional tort was committed is not sufficient to warrant an award of punitive damages.”]) Defendant counters Plaintiff’s references to OSHA regulations and general industry knowledge of risks by stating that even if Defendant knew the Sorter lacked a guard and that industry standards required one, that does not alone establish the requisite conscious disregard for safety needed to justify punitive damages. Further, Defendant asserts that the existence of a defect is not enough to warrant punitive damages. (See Gawara v. United States Brass Corp. (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1341, 1344 [“Plaintiffs were not entitled to punitive damages simply because defendants allegedly sold or manufactured a defective product with knowledge of the defects; an award of punitive damages requires something more than the mere commission of a tort.”]) Next, Defendant distinguishes Pfeifer from the instant matter, pointing out that Pfeifer upheld punitive damages because the defendant’s knowledge of asbestos dangers and its repeated failure to warn created a factual basis for the jury to find malice. (Pfeifer v. Jone Crane, Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1299-1302.) Defendant also state that unlike in Pfeifer, Plaintiff here has not alleged Defendant had specific knowledge of a hazard and deliberately ignored it, rather Defendant is alleged to have known or should have known the need for a safety guard.AnalysisHere, the punitive damages allegations against Defendant are framed in terms of malice. Malice is defined as “conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(1).) Thus, in cases involving conduct performed without intent to harm, a finding of malice for punitive purposes requires proof by clear and convincing evidence that defendant's tortious wrong amounted to despicable conduct and that such despicable conduct was carried on with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others. (See College Hospital, Inc. v. Superior Court (1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 725; see also Gawara v. U.S. Brass Corp. (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1341, 1361.) Despicable conduct is conduct” ‘so vile, base, contemptible, miserable, wretched or loathsome that it would be looked down upon and despised by ordinary decent people.’” (American Airlines, Inc. v. Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 1017, 1050.) Additionally, to demonstrate conscious disregard, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his or her conduct, and that the defendant willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences. (Taylor v. Superior Court (1979) 24 Cal.3d 890, 895-896.) Finally, a request for punitive damages against a corporation must allege that an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation was either personally responsible for the allegedly despicable conduct or that an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation: (1) had advance knowledge of the despicable conduct and consciously disregarded it; or (2) authorized or ratified the despicable conduct. (See Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (b).)Upon review of Plaintiff’s punitive damages allegations, Plaintiff fails to adequately allege that an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation: (1) had advance knowledge of the despicable conduct and consciously disregarded it; or (2) authorized or ratified the despicable conduct. (See Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (b).) There are no facts alleged in the complaint addressing any conduct whatsoever by an officer, director, or managing agent of Defendant. Thus, the allegations of the complaint are insufficient to support the request for punitive damages.Accordingly, the instant motion to strike GRANTED with 20 days leave to amend.Tentative RulingThe instant motion to strike is GRANTED with 20 days leave to amend.
