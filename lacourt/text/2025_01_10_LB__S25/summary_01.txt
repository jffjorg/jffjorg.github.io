And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case that will be heard on January 10, 2025. The ruling notes that the plaintiff has failed to submit an opposition to the defendant's separate statement in support of their motion for summary judgment. The judge believes this was an oversight and did not raise any concerns in the defendant's reply papers. The matter will be continued to a mutually agreeable date to allow the plaintiff to submit their opposition and for the court to review it. The judge will discuss the missing opposition with the parties at the hearing and emphasize that a separate statement is mandatory for opposition papers to a motion for summary judgment, as required by California law.
