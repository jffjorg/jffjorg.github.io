And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on plaintiff Terry Records' motion for attorney fees. The plaintiff seeks to recover $596,030 in attorney fees from defendants ALF Management Group, Inc. and Hakop Chichyan. The judge has determined that the plaintiff is entitled to recover attorney fees under Labor Code section 226, subdivision (e)(1), which allows an employee to recover attorney fees for failure to provide accurate wage statements.

The judge has reduced the claimed attorney fees from 1,059 hours to 150 hours, which is the number of hours spent working on the plaintiff's sole successful cause of action (failure to provide accurate wage statements) and the present motion. The judge has also reduced the hourly rates claimed by plaintiff's counsel, Timothy Donahue and Steve Basinger, from $790 and $500, respectively, to $600 and $400, respectively.

Based on these reductions, the judge has awarded the plaintiff $72,000 in attorney fees. The award consists of $36,000 for 60 hours of work by Timothy Donahue at $600 per hour, and $36,000 for 90 hours of work by Steve Basinger at $400 per hour. The judge has denied the plaintiff's claim for attorney fees for the work of an unnamed legal assistant, finding that the tasks performed by the assistant were clerical and not reasonably compensable.

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees in part, and the plaintiff shall recover $72,000 in attorney fees from the defendants.

```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court is considering plaintiff Terry Records' motion for attorney fees in the amount of $596,030 from defendants ALF Management Group, Inc. and Hakop Chichyan. The motion is based on three statutes: Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.6, Labor Code section 218.5, and Labor Code section 226. The court finds that only Labor Code section 226 applies, as plaintiff prevailed on a cause of action for failure to provide accurate wage statements under that section.

The court awards 150 hours of attorney time working on the successful cause of action and the present motion, and allocates those hours among the two attorneys who worked on the case. The court also reduces the hours and rates claimed by plaintiff, and awards a total of $72,000 in attorney fees: $36,000 for 60 hours by Timothy Donahue at $600 per hour, and $36,000 for 90 hours by Steve Basinger at $400 per hour.

The court concludes that the reasonable hourly market rates are $600 for Timothy Donahue and $400 for Steve Basinger, and awards plaintiff a total of $72,000 in attorney fees. The court grants plaintiff's motion for attorney fees in part, and awards plaintiff $72,000 in attorney fees from defendants ALF Management Group, Inc. and Hakop Chichyan.

Summary:
The plaintiff, Terry Records, moves for $596,030 in attorney fees from the defendants ALF Management Group, Inc. and Hakop Chichyan. The court determines the reasonable attorney fees based on the lodestar method, which involves multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended by the reasonable hourly rate. In this case, the plaintiff claims 1,059 hours of attorney fees, but the court reduces this amount after determining that not all tasks were necessary or reasonable, and that the plaintiff should not benefit from withholding information about the hours spent on specific tasks. The plaintiff is entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees under Labor Code section 226, as he prevailed on his cause of action for failure to provide accurate wage statements. The court awards a total of $72,000 in attorney fees, with $36,000 for 60 hours by Donahue at $600 per hour and $36,000 for 90 hours by Basinger at $400 per hour.
