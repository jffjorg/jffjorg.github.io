And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on plaintiff Terry Records' motion for attorney fees. The plaintiff seeks to recover $596,030 in attorney fees from defendants ALF Management Group, Inc. and Hakop Chichyan. The judge has determined that the plaintiff is entitled to recover attorney fees under Labor Code section 226, subdivision (e)(1), which allows an employee to recover attorney fees for failure to provide accurate wage statements.

The judge has reduced the claimed attorney fees from 1,059 hours to 150 hours, which is the number of hours spent working on the plaintiff's sole successful cause of action (failure to provide accurate wage statements) and the present motion. The judge has also reduced the hourly rates claimed by plaintiff's counsel, Timothy Donahue and Steve Basinger, from $790 and $500, respectively, to $600 and $400, respectively.

Based on these reductions, the judge has awarded the plaintiff $72,000 in attorney fees. The award consists of $36,000 for 60 hours of work by Timothy Donahue at $600 per hour, and $36,000 for 90 hours of work by Steve Basinger at $400 per hour. The judge has denied the plaintiff's claim for attorney fees for the work of an unnamed legal assistant, finding that the tasks performed by the assistant were clerical and not reasonably compensable.

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees in part, and the plaintiff shall recover $72,000 in attorney fees from the defendants.
