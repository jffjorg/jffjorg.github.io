v. GROCERY OUTLET 
CASE
NUMBER:     19STCV33178

TENTATIVE RULING
                                             
MOTION: 
    Defendants’ Motion To Tax Costs

HELD:           GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART
 
 
I.               
Background
 
              This
is a premises liability personal injury action stemming from an incident in
2018 when P was shopping at D’s supermarket. 
Some lightweight snack packages that had been stored in an open display
box fell on P, which she claimed caused her multiple physical injuries.  After a 5 day jury trial, the jury found that
D was not negligent and this Court accordingly entered a judgment for D on 3/26/24.
 
              Prior
to trial, D made 2 § 998 offers to compromise: 
6/12/20 for $15,001 and one on 8/30/22 for $25,000.  Neither was accepted.
 
              On
4/10/24, D served its Memorandum of Costs (“Cost Memo”) on P seeking $75,315.50
as the prevailing party.  P brings this
instant motion to strike the Cost Memo in its entirety or in the alternative to
tax various costs being sought thereunder.
 
 
II.       ANALYSIS
 
A.     P’s Motion to Strike D’s Cost Memo
 
              As
a threshold matter, P apparently moves to strike the entirety of the Cost Memo
on the grounds that it failed to include a proof of service.  Strangely, P does not contest that she
actually was served and had received the Cost Memo (which appears obvious given
this detailed motion to tax individual items contained therein).  In any event, P is incorrect – a review of the
Cost Memo on file with this Court shows a proof of service on page 2, indicating
that it had been mailed to P’s counsel on the same day it was filed: 4/10/24.  P’s motion to strike the Cost Memo for
failure to serve it is DENIED.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
III.           
SPECIFIC
CHALLENGED COSTS 
 
A.    
Item
1: Filing and Motion Fees ($1,164.40)   
 
P asserts that D has included
impermissible fees in this Item including service of process 
fees,
telephonic appearance fees, and credit card fees.  
 
            D denies that the amounts sought in
this Item contain any of the improper fees alleged by P, and are solely
comprised of filing fees paid to the court for various pleadings filed to
defend itself, with the exception of $150 which was an “Advance Jury fee filing”
 that had accidentally been claimed in
Item 1 as well as Item 2.  An examination
of D’s Memorandum of Costs (Worksheet) bears out D’s claims, including D’s
admitted double billing error of $150.  As
such, this Court will GRANT P’s motion to tax this Item in the amount of
$150.
 
B.    
Item
2: Jury fees ($658.46)
 
With the correction of Item 1 to
remove the $150 improperly included there, and with the 
$150
properly included in Item 2, this Item is correct and the motion to tax this
Item is DENIED.    
 
C.   
Item
4: Deposition Costs ($16,993.35) 
 
P’s claim that this Item improperly
contains attorney’s meals is wholly unsupported.  P’s 
claim
that videotaping of depositions is not recoverable is flatly contradicted by the
explicit authorization in CCP § 1033.5(a)(3)(A).  These objections are frivolous at best and thus
P’s motion to tax these costs is DENIED.
 
 
D.   
Other:
Expert Fees ($ 53,774.29) and Mediation Fees ($2,725) 
 
This Court finds that both D’s §
998 offers were valid and that P obviously did not do
better
than either.  When there are two § 998
offers of settlement and the offeree does not best either one, the California
Supreme Court has held that § 998 costs are awardable from the time of the
expiration of the first § 998 offer.  Martinez
v. Brownco Construction Co. (2013) 56 Cal.4th 1014, 1026-27.  Here, P has not met her burden of proving
which of these expert fees were not reasonable or necessary and therefore her motion
to tax expert fees is DENIED.
 
            With respect to the mediation fees incurred, such
costs are awardable in this Court’s discretion “based on the facts and
circumstances of the particular action.” 
Berkeley Cement, Inc. v. Regents of University of California (2019)
30 Cal.App.5th 1133, 1142-43. 
In this case, given the weight of the evidence against P’s case and in
favor of D’s case (least of which being the video of the incident), and the ultimate
defense verdict rendered, it is clear that P should have settled this matter as
had been recommended by the private mediator. 
This Court will exercise its discretion in awarding mediation costs against
P and therefore P’s motion to tax mediation costs is DENIED.
 
 
IV.  CONCLUSION
 
            P’s motion to tax D’s Cost Memorandum
is GRANTED in the amount of $150. 
As such, costs are awarded to D in the net amount of $75,165.50 [$75,315.50
- $150 = $75,165.50].  The clerk of this
Court shall add this award of costs to the Judgment against P.
