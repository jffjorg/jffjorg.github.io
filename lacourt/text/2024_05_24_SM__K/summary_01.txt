And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to tax costs. The plaintiff, Thomas, alleges that the defendants, Grocery Outlet, failed to properly serve their cost memo, but the court finds that the memo was properly served. The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to tax costs in the amount of $150, which was incorrectly claimed as an "Advance Jury fee filing" and a "credit card fee." The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to strike the cost memo in its entirety and has awarded the defendants costs in the net amount of $75,165.50. The court has also denied the plaintiff's motions to tax individual items in the cost memo, including deposition costs, expert fees, and mediation fees.
