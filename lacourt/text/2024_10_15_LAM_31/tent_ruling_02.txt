MOTION
FOR LEAVE TO FILE A SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Douglas Lalonde 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendants
Val-Pro, Inc., et al.
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On June 25, 2022, Plaintiff Douglas Lalonde (Douglas or
Plaintiff) filed a complaint against Defendants, Val-Pro-Inc. dba Valley Fruit
& Produce Company (Val-Pro), Carrie Lalonde, and Donald J. Lalonde, arising
from business disputes and wage and hour violations.  The First Amended Complaint, which is the
operative pleading, was filed on February 6, 2023. 
 
            On April 4,
2023, the parties attended a mediation. 
The parties purportedly reached a settlement.  
 
            On April
25, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement.  The Notice indicated that the settlement was
conditional and that a request for dismissal would be filed no later than June
26, 2023.  
 
            On October 11,
2023, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Settlement. 
On January 29, 2024, the court denied the motion. 
 
            On May 8,
2024, Val-Pro filed a complaint against Douglas in Los Angeles County Superior
Court (Case No. 24STCV11574), alleging causes of action for (1) breach of
written contract, (2) account stated, (3) open book account, (4) conversion,
and (5) violation of Penal Code § 496.  
 
            On July 10,
2024, Defendants filed a Notice of Related Case.  
 
            On August
2, 2024, the court found this case and Case No. 24STCV11574 were not related.
 
On September 16, 2024, Douglas filed a Cross-Complaint in
Case No. 24STCV11574 which alleges the same causes of action Douglas asserts in
this action, including the following six additional causes of action: (1)
financial elder abuse, (2) declaratory relief re management of Val-Pro, (3) appointment
of a provisional director of Val-Pro under Corporations Code section 308, (4) declaratory
relief regarding management and control over L&L Properties, LLC, (5) declaratory
relief regarding the inapplicability of any formula for determining the value
of Plaintiff’s shares in Val-Pro, and (6) accounting.  
 
Plaintiff now seeks leave to file the Second Amended
Complaint.  Plaintiff seeks to add the
six additional causes of action identified above. 
 
Defendants filed an opposition.  Plaintiff replied.
 
II.        DISCUSSION
& LEGAL STANDARD
 
Plaintiff is not entitled to an order granting leave to file
the proposed Second Amended Complaint. 
 
In ruling on a motion for leave to amend a pleading, the
court does not consider the merits of the proposed amendment, because “the
preferable practice would be to permit the amendment and allow the parties to
test its legal sufficiency by demurrer, motion for judgment on the pleadings or
other appropriate proceedings.”¿ (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior Court
(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048.)¿ While the court may deny leave to amend
where the proposed amendment is insufficient to state a valid cause of action
or defense, such denial is most appropriate where the insufficiency cannot be
cured by further amendment—i.e., where the statute of limitations has expired
or the insufficiency is established by controlling caselaw. (California
Casualty Gen. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 274,
280-281, disapproved on other grounds in Kransco v. American Empire Surplus
Lines Ins. Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 390.)¿¿ 
 
Here, denial for leave to amend is proper because there is
no dispute Plaintiff seeks leave to add the same six causes of action alleged
in his Cross-Complaint in Case No. 24STCV11574.  That case is still pending in Department 49.  Accordingly, Plaintiff improperly seeks to
allege the very same causes of action asserted in another pending action.  This is expressly prohibited by Code of Civil
Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (c). 
A further amendment would therefore be insufficient to cure this defect.
 Having failed to address this argument, Plaintiff
concedes the point.  
 
Based on the foregoing, leave to amend is not
warranted.  Having so concluded, the
court does not address Defendants’ remaining arguments. 
 
III.       CONCLUSION
 
            The motion
is DENIED.
 
            Defendants
to give notice, unless waived.
