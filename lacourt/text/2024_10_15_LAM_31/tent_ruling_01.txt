RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant/Judgment
Debtor Jeff Bankston
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            On January 9,
2021, Plaintiff Richard Mucha (Mucha or Plaintiff) filed this action against Defendant
Jeff Bankston (Bankston or Defendant) for defamation, malicious prosecution,
abuse of process, and infliction of emotional distress.  
 
Defendant defaulted.  On
September 8, 2022, the court entered default judgment against Defendant and in
favor of Plaintiff in the total sum of $255,000. 
 
            On August
22, 2023, the court issued a Writ of Possession ordering Bankston to transfer
possession of tangible assets to Mucha, including (1) 2001 Ford-350 with
Mississippi license plate NOTNOWW and VIN 1FTWW32571ED71916 (2001 Ford), (2)
2002 Ford f-350 with Mississippi license plate WONTON and VIN
1FTWW32F52EA966645 (2002 Ford), and (3) a 1965 Ford Mustang California license
plate STCSHFT and VIN 5409K677490 (1965 Mustang).  Bankston initially agreed to sign over title
of the vehicles but reneged.  With
respect to the 2002 Ford, Bankston reported the titles lost or fraudulently
altered.   As to the 2001 Ford, Bankston claimed to have
sold the vehicle to a John N. Chipolla. 
Chipolla denied having purchased the vehicle and Bankston thereafter
reported the 2001 Ford stolen.  And, as
to the 1965 Mustang Bankston accused Mucha of grand theft auto. 
    
On August 30, 2024, Mucha filed this Petition to Appoint Clerk
of the Court Elisor to sign documents transferring title of the foregoing
vehicles from Bankston to Mucha.
 
On October 4, 2024, Bankston filed handwritten documents
entitled “Emergency Stay Order to Stop Court Elisor From Transferring
Defendants Name on Vehicle Titles to Plaintiff”;  “Rebuttal to Plaintiffs Court Brief Including
But Not Limited To CCP 128(a)(4) and 664.6(a)”; “Emergency Appeal to Stop the
Transfer of Defendants Name on Vehicle Titles Registration to Plaintiff Case is
On Appeal ….”    
 
Mucha did not file a reply. 
 
II.        DISCUSSION
& LEGAL STANDARD
 
            Mucha
requests that the court appoint the court clerk as an elisor to sign documents
on behalf of Bankston authorizing the transfer Bankston’s 2001 Ford, 2002 Ford,
and 1965 Mustang to Mucha.  Mucha argues
the appointment is necessary because Bankston has frustrated the transfer of
these vehicles by falsely reporting they were stolen. 
 
In its common legal meaning, “an elisor is a person
appointed by the court to perform functions like the execution of a deed or
document.”  (Blueberry Properties, LLC
v. Chow¿(2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 1017, 1020 (Blueberry Properties).)  The court may use its discretionary powers to
appoint the court clerk as an¿elisor¿to sign a recalcitrant seller’s name to
all documents necessary to effectuate a court’s order.  (See¿Code Civ.
Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(4); Blueberry Properties, 230 Cal.App.4th at pp.
1020-1021; see also Hood v. Gonzales (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 57, 83 [concluding
that the trial court acted within its discretion in appointing the court clerk
as elisor to endorse a settlement check]; Venice Canals Resident Home Owners
Assn. v. Superior Court (1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 675, 679 [“The inherent power
of the trial court to exercise reasonable control over litigation before it, as
well as the inherent and equitable power to achieve justice and prevent misuse
of processes lawfully issued is well established.”].) 
 
Here, the appointment of an elisor is warranted.  The court entered a default judgment in
Plaintiff’s favor.  Thereafter, the court
issued a Writ of Possession ordering Bankston to transfer possession of tangible
assets to Mucha in satisfaction. (Writ of Possession, 8/25/23.)  Bankston has not complied.   
 
Bankston’s various versions of an opposition lack merit.  Bankston revisits issues that were already decided.  He challenges Judge Orozco’s rulings as well
as Judge Goorvitch’s rulings.  He also
claims this court has already ruled on the matter, which is not the case as
that is the purpose of this hearing.  Much
of Bankston’s “oppositions” are incomprehensible or at least inapposite to this
proceeding.  Bankston fails to present a
meritorious argument in opposition to the motion.   
      
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            The Petition is GRANTED. 
Mucha filed a proposed order, however, that order was rejected by the
clerk’s office.  Mucha is ordered to file
a new proposed order within two court days. 

            
            The clerk
of the court to give notice.
