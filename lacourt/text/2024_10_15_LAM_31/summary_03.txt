And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Kerry Bensinger, has ruled on a motion by the defendants to strike portions of the third amended complaint filed by the plaintiff, Neil H. Cogan. The plaintiff is seeking punitive damages against the defendants, Automobile Club of Southern California, Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club, and American Automobile Association, for breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligent misrepresentation, intentional misrepresentation, and other claims.

The judge has granted the motion to strike the punitive damages requests, finding that the plaintiff was not granted leave to request punitive damages and that the inclusion of the punitive damages requests was an oversight. The judge has directed the plaintiff to serve and file a fourth amended complaint that omits references to or requests for punitive damages. The defendants are to file their answer within 20 days of service of the amended pleading.
