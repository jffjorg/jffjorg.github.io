Significant Statements:
  - "The preferable practice would be to permit the amendment and allow the parties to test its legal sufficiency by demurrer, motion for judgment on the pleadings or other appropriate proceedings." (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048.)
  - "The denial for leave to amend is proper because there is no dispute Plaintiff seeks leave to add the same six causes of action alleged in his Cross-Complaint in Case No. 24STCV11574. That case is still pending in Department 49. According to, Plaintiff improperly seeks to allege the very same causes of action asserted in another pending action. This is expressly prohibited by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (c)."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint. The plaintiff, Douglas Lalonde, is seeking to add six additional causes of action to the original complaint. However, the judge has determined that this is improper because the same causes of action are already being asserted in another pending case (Case No. 24STCV11574) in Department 49. The judge cites Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (c), which prohibits alleging the same causes of action in multiple pending cases. The judge is not considering the merits of the proposed amendment, but rather denying the motion because the proposed amendment is insufficient to state a valid cause of action or defense.
