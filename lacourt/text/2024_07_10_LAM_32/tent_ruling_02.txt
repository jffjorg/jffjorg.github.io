Although the Court earlier
rejected Defendants’ immunity argument in denying their motion for judgment on
the pleadings, “summary judgment/adjudication motions are law and motion
proceedings entirely distinct from an attack on a pleading by demurrer.
Therefore, it [is] proper for the trial court to decide the . . . claim on
summary adjudication differently from its prior disposition of the claim on
demurrer.” (Oakland Raiders v. National Football League (2005) 131
Cal.App.4th 621, 634, fn. 10.) With the benefit of evidence at the summary
judgment stage, the Court is entitled to reassess the immunity issue and reach
a different conclusion.
