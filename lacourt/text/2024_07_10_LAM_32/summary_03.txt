And here is the English-text summary:

The Tentative Ruling is a denial of the defendants' motion for terminating sanctions against the plaintiff, Maryam Khani. The motion was based on the plaintiff's failure to comply with two court orders: one on December 8, 2023, and one on May 8, 2024. The court found that the plaintiff's failure to pay monetary sanctions in the first order and to serve discovery responses in the second order were not willful and did not warrant terminating sanctions. The court also noted that the plaintiff's counsel had mistakenly believed that all discovery responses had been sent, which led to the delay in serving the missing responses. The court concluded that the requested sanctions were unwarranted and denied the motion.
