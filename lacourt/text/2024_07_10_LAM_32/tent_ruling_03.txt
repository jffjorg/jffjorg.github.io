  Case No.:  22STCV26639
  Hearing Date:  July 10, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendants’ motion for terminating
  sanctions




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On August 17, 2022, Plaintiff filed
this legal malpractice action against Defendants Bobby Babak Saadian and
Wilshire Law Firm, PLC. Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint
on December 6, 2022, asserting causes of action for (1) legal malpractice, (2)
breach of fiduciary duty, and (3) fraud. 
            On December 8, 2023, the Court
granted Defendant Wilshire Law Firm’s motion to compel further responses to
requests for admissions and form interrogatories. On May 8, 2024, the Court
granted Defendant Saadian’s motions to compel responses to interrogatories,
requests for production, and requests for admission.
            On June 12, 2024, Defendants filed
the instant motion for terminating sanctions based on Plaintiff’s failure to
comply with those two orders. Defendants alternatively request issue,
evidentiary, and monetary sanctions. Plaintiff filed her opposition on June 26,
2024. Defendants filed their reply on July 2, 2024.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
            The Court may impose monetary or
nonmonetary sanctions against a party engaging in misuse of the discovery
process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) Misuse of the discovery process is
defined as, among other things, failing to respond to an authorized method of
discovery, making an evasive response to discovery, or disobeying a court order
for discovery. (Id., § 2023.010.) 
If a lesser sanction fails to curb misuse,
a greater sanction is warranted: continuing misuses of the discovery process
warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until the sanction is reached that will
curb the abuse. (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th
967, 992.) “The penalty should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should
not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party
entitled to but denied discovery.” (Wilson v. Jefferson (1985) 163
Cal.App.3d 952, 959.) Generally, two facts are prerequisite to the imposition
of nonmonetary sanctions: (1) there must be a failure to comply with a court
order; and (2) the failure must be willful. (Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp.
(2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.)
DISCUSSION
I.
December 8, 2023 Order
Defendants argue that Plaintiff failed to
comply with the Court’s December 8, 2023 order by failing to pay the monetary
sanctions. (Coronel Decl. ¶ 4.) Defendants acknowledge that Plaintiff otherwise
complied with the order by serving further responses. (Ibid.)  
“[I]t is an abuse of discretion for a
trial court to issue a terminating sanction for failure to pay the sanction.” (Newland
v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 610.) A monetary sanction is
enforceable as a judgment, and in an appropriate case, failure to pay a
sanction may be punishable as contempt. (Ibid.) Thus, terminating
sanctions are not the appropriate way to address Plaintiff’s failure to pay
sanctions. (Ibid.)
II.
May 8, 2024 Order
            After the Court’s order, Plaintiff
only served responses to requests for admission and form interrogatories but
did not serve responses to the requests for production or special
interrogatories, nor paid sanctions. (Coronel Decl. ¶¶ 11-13.) Plaintiff’s
counsel mistakenly believed that all of the discovery responses had been sent
on May 6, 2024, when in reality only the RFAs and FROGs were sent. (Seuthe
Decl. ¶ 10.) Furthermore, the order required moving party to give notice, but
there is no indication that Defendants served notice of the order to Plaintiff.
Plaintiff served the missing responses soon after this motion was filed. (Id.,
¶ 9.) The adequacy of the responses is not at issue in this motion. The May 8
order only concerned Plaintiff’s failure to provide responses in the first
instance, not the substance of the responses.  

III.
Sanctions
            Based on the above facts, the Court
finds that the requested sanctions are unwarranted. Specifically, the
terminating, issue, and evidentiary sanctions would be disproportionate because
Plaintiff only failed to serve two sets of responses and eventually did so upon
realizing the error. Plaintiff has otherwise responded to the other discovery
requests implicated in the prior orders. Plaintiff’s failure to serve the RFAs
and FROGs was not willful because counsel inadvertently believed that all of
the responses had been sent together. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendants’ motion for sanctions is
DENIED.
