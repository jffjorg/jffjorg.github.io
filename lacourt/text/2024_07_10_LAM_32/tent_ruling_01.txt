  order RE:
defendants’ motion for summary judgment or
  adjudication  




 


 



BACKGROUND
            This action was initially filed on
May 27, 2020. The case was initially assigned to Judge James Chalfant in
Department 85. The operative Second Amended Complaint (SAC) was filed on
February 17, 2021. The SAC is filed by Plaintiffs Franklin Armory, Inc. (FAI)
and California Rifle & Pistol Association (CPRA) against Defendants
California Department of Justice (DOJ) and Xavier Becerra (Becerra). 
            FAI is a federally-licensed firearms
manufacturer that manufactures a series of firearms which are neither “rifles,”
“pistols,” nor “shotguns” as defined by California law. (SAC ¶ 2.) FAI
designates these firearms as “Title I” firearms. (Ibid.) Licensed
firearm dealers in California are required to submit all background checks to
DOJ through the Dealer Record of Sale Entry System (DES). (Id., ¶ 49.)
The online DES submission form requires the user to input several pieces of
information, among which is the type of firearm being exchanged. (Id., ¶
58.) The DES form only allows the user to select “long gun” or “handgun,” and
within the “long gun” category, the only options are “rifle,” “rifle/shotgun,”
or “shotgun.” (Ibid.) However, FAI’s Title I firearms are neither
rifles, pistols, nor shotguns. (Id., ¶ 2.) The dropdown menu does not
provide a catchall option for “other” types of firearms. (Id., ¶ 58.)
Plaintiffs allege that this prevents firearms dealers from submitting the
required information for the transfer of certain types of firearms and thereby
acts as a technological barrier to the lawful sale of firearms. (Id., ¶¶
6, 58.) This has resulted in lost profits from the sale of Title I guns. (Id.,
¶¶ 138, 147, 150, 159, 161.) CPRA is a nonprofit organization of members who
wish to purchase firearms with undefined subtypes, such as Title Is, but could
not because of the restrictions in the DES system. (Id., ¶ 6.)  
            Defendants allegedly carried out
this scheme to delay the lawful transfer of Title I firearms until the
Legislature could pass a law that made Title I firearms illegal. (SAC ¶ 109.)
Indeed, SB 118 was passed on August 6, 2020, designating the Title I centerfire
firearm as a banned “assault weapon.” (Id., ¶ 112.) SB 118 allows
individuals already in possession of a banned assault weapon prior to September
1, 2020 to keep the firearm, under the condition that the firearm is properly
registered. (Id., ¶ 113.) However, Defendants’ actions prevented those
who placed deposits prior to September 1, 2020 from ever acquiring Title I
centerfire firearms, thus allegedly depriving those individuals of their due
process, Second Amendment, and property rights. (Id. at ¶¶
113-114.)       
            The SAC asserts the following causes
of action: (1) declaratory and injunctive relief; (2) petition for writ of
mandate; (3) tortious inference with contractual relations; (4) tortious
interference with prospective economic advantage; (5) negligent interference
with prospective economic advantage; (6) violation of procedural due process;
(7) violation of substantive due process; (8) declaratory and injunctive
relief; and (9) violation of public policy.
            The DES system was overhauled in
October 2021, resulting in the addition of a “other” category. Accordingly, on
January 27, 2022, Judge Chalfant granted Defendants’ motion to dismiss the
first, second, and eighth causes of action. Judge Chalfant subsequently ordered
the case transferred to Department 1 for reassignment, whereafter the case was
assigned to this department. On September 7, 2023, this Court granted
Defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the sixth, seventh, and
ninth causes of action. 
            On April 26, 2024, Defendants filed
the instant motion for summary judgment or adjudication as to the remaining
causes of action. FAI filed its opposition on June 26, 2024. Defendants filed
their reply on July 5, 2024.   
LEGAL STANDARD
The function of a motion for summary
judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing
party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an
order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure section
437c, subdivision (c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if
all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the
evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there
is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp.
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion
for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the
affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of
fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of
Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v.
Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-382.)
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial
burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to
establish a defense. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); Scalf v. D. B.
Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has
met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable
issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a
defense thereto. To establish a triable issue of material fact, the party
opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster
v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.) Courts “liberally construe the
evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts
concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide,
Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
EVIDENTIARY
OBJECTIONS
            FAI’s objections are not material to
the Court’s disposition of the motion. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 437c(q).)
Defendants did not file any objections. 
DISCUSSION
I.
Governmental Immunity
            “Except as otherwise provided by
statute . . . [a] public entity is not liable for an injury, whether such
injury arises out of an act or omission of the public entity or a public
employee or any other person.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 815(a).) “[S]ection 815
abolishes common law tort liability for public entities.” (Miklosy v.
Regents of University of California (2008) 44 Cal.4th 876, 899.) “In other
words, direct tort liability of public entities must be based on a specific
statute declaring them to be liable . . . .” (Eastburn v. Regional Fire
Protection Authority (2003) 31 Cal.4th 1175, 1183.)
One such statute is Government Code
section 815.6, which imposes
liability on a public entity for injuries caused by a violation of a mandatory
duty derived from another statute. “[A]pplication of section 815.6 requires
that the enactment at issue be obligatory, rather than merely discretionary or
permissive, in its directions to the public entity.” (Haggis v. City of Los
Angeles (2000) 22 Cal.4th 490, 498.) “If a statute does not require that a ‘particular
action’ be taken, Government Code section 815.6 does not create the right to
sue a public entity.” (Shamsian v. Department of Conservation (2006) 136
Cal.App.4th 621, 632.) “It is not enough, moreover, that the public entity or
officer have been under an obligation to perform a function if the function
itself involves the exercise of discretion.” (Id. at p. 633.)
            Here, the cited Penal Code
provisions do not require a particular action to be taken with regards to the
DES system. (See Pen. Code, §§ 28155, 28205, 28215, 28220.) To the extent DOJ
was required to implement an electronic reporting system (see Pen. Code, §
28205(c)), it did so by implementing the DES, which has existed since 2003 (see
SAC ¶ 49). How DOJ implements the reporting system, including what changes to
make in response to the emergence of a new firearm type, is left in its
discretion as the Penal Code provisions do not mandate any “particular action”
in such a situation. (See Shamsian, supra, 136 Cal.App.4th at p. 632.) The
SAC identifies a few potential ways to alleviate the alleged defect in the DES,
which confirms that DOJ has discretion over changes in DES. (See SAC
¶¶ 64-66.) FAI also acknowledges that Penal Code section 28205(c) grants
DOJ “authority” to implement a variety of “alternative means” to allow for
processing of Title I firearms. (Plntf.’s Additional Facts (AF) 41.)
Furthermore, Penal Code section 28245 states that “[w]henever the Department of
Justice acts pursuant to this article as it pertains to firearms other than
handguns, the department’s acts or omissions shall be deemed to be
discretionary within the meaning of the Government Claims Act.” In sum, the
operation of DES, including the implementation of changes, is discretionary and
therefore falls outside the mandatory duty exception under section 815.6.  
            Furthermore, section 815.6 does not
apply unless the enactment at issue was “designed to protect against the risk
of a particular kind of injury.” (Gov. Code, § 815.6.) “The plaintiff must show
the injury is ‘one of the consequences which the [enacting body] sought to
prevent through imposing the alleged mandatory duty.’” (Haggis, supra, 22
Cal.4th at p. 499, quoting Hoff v. Vacaville Unified School Dist. (1998)
19 Cal.4th 925, 939.) The injury alleged here is financial loss due to the
inability to sell Title I firearms. (SAC ¶¶ 138, 147, 150, 159, 161.) However,
the relevant Penal Code provisions were designed to protect public safety, not
to preserve the financial interests of firearms dealers. (See People v.
Alexander
(2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 469, 479 [“requiring an applicant ‘to undergo a
background check’ is ‘designed to ensure only that those bearing arms in the
jurisdiction are, in fact, law-abiding, responsible citizens’”].)   
            FAI does not directly address
Defendants’ authorities or analysis on the application of sections 815 and
815.6. Instead, FAI characterizes these arguments as “irrelevant” because FAI “does
not assert liability against DOJ for the three remaining causes of action.”
(Opp. 11:2-7.) FAI argues that it only seeks liability against Becerra, who is
not covered under section 815 because that statute only protects public
entities, not individuals. (See Gov. Code, §§ 811.2, 815.) FAI effectively concedes
that DOJ is not liable. Therefore, DOJ is not liable as a matter of law.            
II.
Discretionary Immunity[1]
            “Except as otherwise provided by
statute, a public employee is not liable for an injury resulting from his act
or omission where the act or omission was the result of the exercise of the
discretion vested in him, whether or not such discretion be abused.” (Gov.
Code, § 820.2.) Unlike section 815, section 820.2 expressly applies to
individual employees. Section 820.2 “confers a general immunity for
discretionary acts taken within the scope of authority.” (Leon v. County of
Riverside (2023) 14 Cal.5th 910, 928.) The protection is broad and “applies
even to ‘lousy’ decisions . . . no matter how horrible the outcome.” (Gabrielle
A. v. County of Orange (2017) 10 Cal.App.5th 1268, 1285.) 
            However, discretionary immunity does
not apply to all acts that involve discretion in the literal sense. “[A]lmost
all acts involve some choice among alternatives, and the statutory immunity
thus cannot depend upon a literal or semantic parsing of the word ‘discretion.’”
(Caldwell v. Montoya (1995) 10 Cal.4th 972, 981.) “Immunity is reserved
for those ‘basic policy decisions [which have] . . . been [expressly] committed
to coordinate branches of government,’ and as to which judicial interference
would thus be ‘unseemly.’” (Ibid., quoting Johnson v. State
of California
(1968) 69 Cal.2d 782, 793.) “[T]here is no basis for immunizing lower-level, or
‘ministerial,’ decisions that merely implement a basic policy already
formulated.” (Ibid.) 
Furthermore, immunity “requires a showing
that ‘the specific conduct giving rise to the suit’ involved an actual exercise
of discretion, i.e., a ‘[conscious] balancing [of] risks and advantages.’” (Caldwell,
supra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 983, quoting Johnson, supra, 69 Cal.2d at pp.
794, 795, fn. 8.) Once this showing is made, however, a government official is
immunized even for “carelessness, malice, bad judgment, or abuse of discretion”
because immunity “does not require a strictly careful, thorough, formal, or
correct evaluation.” (Id. at pp. 983-84.)    
The evidence shows that Defendants exercised
discretion by “initiat[ing] a review to evaluate the resources required for a
potential DES enhancement to add a ‘other’ option.” (Mendoza Decl. ¶ 8.) This
involved “a balancing of multiple factors and a weighing of competing
priorities among the multiple proposed DES enhancement requests pending at that
time.” (Ibid.) Defendants “also evaluated and weighed the allocation of
available resources to such an enhancement, such as the number of personnel
required, budgeting of the enhancement, and the time it would take to complete
said enhancement.” (Ibid.)
As a temporary alternative, Defendants
considered the “potential of doing some sort of free-form field” for “dealers .
. . to type in something specific related to the Franklin Armory Title 1.”
(Barvir Decl., Ex. 11 (Mendoza Depo.) 141:1-12.) However, allowing dealers to
“type in anything” would have made it “very difficult for us to be able to
track those firearms and identify those firearms in the systems.” (Id.
at 145:17-21.) Defendants ultimately decided not to implement this particular
change due to the anticipated operational difficulties and public safety
concerns. (Mendoza Decl. ¶ 10.) 
Defendants ultimately decided to add a
“other” option to the DES application after SB 118 was passed, upon “weighing
competing priorities among the multiple information technology projects pending
at that time in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic.” (Mendoza Decl. ¶ 11.)
This enhancement was completed in October 2021, simultaneously deploying with
other assault weapon registration changes. (Ibid.; Barvir Decl., Ex. 11
(Mendoza Depo.) 128:7-11.) 
These facts show that changing the DES is
a policy-level decision requiring the exercise of discretion, rather than a
ministerial implementation of an existing directive. FAI’s disputes against
Director Mendoza’s testimony are not material disputes that negate Mendoza’s
description of the process of implementing changes to DES. (See Plntf.’s Resp.
to UF 14-17.) Ultimately, FAI does not dispute that the process involves
considerations of competing interests, resource allocation, budget constraints,
and the like. (See Mendoza Decl. ¶ 5.) FAI also presents no evidence to
materially dispute the fact that implementing a “other” option to DES required
many months, diversion of over a dozen employees from other projects, and
changes to other applications and databases beyond DES. (Id., ¶ 9.)
Defendants may have made these assessments
incorrectly, or even acted with malice, in relation to the Title I issue. For
example, Plaintiff contends that changes should have been implemented much
sooner, specifically before the passage of SB 118. (See Plntf.’s Resp. to UF
16-18; AF 49-53, 60.) However, the law is clear that section 820.2 immunizes “carelessness,
malice, bad judgment, or abuse of discretion.” (Caldwell, supra, 10
Cal.4th at pp. 983-84.) “[G]overnment officials are not personally liable for their
discretionary acts within the scope of their authority even though it is
alleged that their conduct was malicious.” (Freeny v. City of San
Buenaventura (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1343.) For Defendants to be held
civilly liable for not implementing a certain change within a certain timeframe
would amount to “judicial interference” with the policymaking process. (See Caldwell,
supra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 981.) Therefore, section 820.2 precludes liability
for the challenged conduct as a matter of law. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendants’ motion for summary
judgment is GRANTED.
