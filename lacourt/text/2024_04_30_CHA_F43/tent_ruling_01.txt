SUMMARY OF
ACTION
Plaintiff
Justine Amanda Cruz Echavez (Plaintiff) filed this action against Defendant California
Institute of the Arts (Defendant) on April 18, 2023. On July 7, 2023, Plaintiff
served Defendant with Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set
One. On September 19, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with objections and
responses to Plaintiff’s RFPs without verifications.
 
Plaintiff
claims that Defendant objected to RFP Nos. 7 and 20 and failed to provide any
substantive response to RFP No. 20. Plaintiff sent Defendant a meet and confer
letter on October 30, 2023, regarding the alleged deficiencies. On November 20,
2023, defense counsel requested additional time to respond. Plaintiff agreed to
a 30-day extension. On December 22, 2023, Defendant served supplemental
responses to the RFPs but failed to provide verification, and Plaintiff still
found the responses to RFP Nos. 7 and 20 to be deficient.
 
On January 3,
2024, Plaintiff sent another meet and confer letter. After following up with
defense counsel several times, a final deadline of February 7, 2024, was set.
Prior to Plaintiff filing this motion on February 6, 2024, Defendant never
addressed the deficiencies.
 
In Defendant’s
opposition filed on April 17, 2024, Defendant indicates that it has provided
Amended Supplemental Responses that should address the issues that Plaintiff
had.
 
Plaintiff
argues in her reply filed on April 23, 2024, that Defendant’s new supplemental responses
for RFP Nos. 7 and 20 have not been verified. It appears from Plaintiff’s reply
that verification and sanctions are the only remaining issues.
 
ANALYSIS
A party to whom
a demand for inspection is direct must sign the response under oath, and failure
to provide a verification for responses is “tantamount to no response” at all.
(CCP §§ 2030.250; 2031.250; Appleton v. Superior Court (1998) 206
Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)
 
Defendant has
not verified its Amended Second Supplemental Responses to RFP Nos. 7 and 20. This
verification is required. 
 
Defendant is
ordered to provide verification for its Amended Second Supplemental Responses
to RFP Nos. 7 and 20.
 
             Sanctions
Pursuant to CCP
§ 2031.310(h), courts “shall impose a monetary sanction” against a party or
attorney who unsuccessfully opposes a motion to compel a further response to
requests for production without substantial justification. It is a misuse of
the discovery process to make unmeritorious objections and evasive responses
and such misuse is sanctionable. (CCP § 2023.010.)
 
Plaintiff has
requested against Defendant and Defendant’s counsel of record. Defendant
unsuccessfully opposed Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses because
the further responses provided by Defendant were without verification and
Defendant did not serve the responses until after Plaintiff filed this motion.
Some sanctions against Defendant are warranted. Plaintiff has requested $4,200
in sanctions based on 8 hours at $525 an hour. (Khatib Decl., ¶¶ 13-14.) Eight
hours for this motion appears to be excessive. The Court will only assess
sanctions for 4 hours at $525 an hour for a total of $2,100.
 
Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions is granted in the amount of $2,100 against Defendant and
Defendant’s counsel of record.
 
ORDER
1.      Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents is
granted for the verification of responses.
2.      Defendant
must provide verified responses within 30 days.
3.      Defendant
and Defendant’s counsel of record are ordered to pay sanctions in the amount of
$2,100 to Plaintiff’s counsel within 30 days.
