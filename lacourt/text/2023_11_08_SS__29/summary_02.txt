And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to continue the trial date to March 25, 2024. The defendants argued that good cause exists for the continuance due to the parties agreeing to mediate the dispute in January. The court finds that there is good cause for continuing the trial date, as the parties have agreed to attend mediation and there is a high degree of diligence in litigating the matter. The court also notes that the parties have not filed an opposition to the motion and that the continuance does not appear to prejudice the plaintiffs.
