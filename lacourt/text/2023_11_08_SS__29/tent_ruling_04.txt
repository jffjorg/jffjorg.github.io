Background
 
On June 16, 2021, Plaintiff Humberto A.
Ramos (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Thomas Ward, City of
Montebello, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority, Southern
California Regional Rail Authority dba Metrolink, and Does 1 through 100 for
(1) battery; (2) assault; (3) negligence; (4) a second negligence count; and
(5) breach of statutory liability.  On
filing, this case was assigned a Final Status Conference date of November 30,
2022, and a Trial date of December 14, 2022.
 
No one appeared at the Final Status
Conference.  On the trial date, Plaintiff’s
counsel appeared and represented that he had lost track of his client.  The Court vacated the trial date, set an OSC
re dismissal for failure to file proof of service on June 16, 2023, set an
second OSC re monetary sanctions for failure to file proof of service for the
same date, and also set a trial setting conference for the same date.
 
On March 29, 2023, Defendant City of Montebello
(“City”) filed a demurrer.  On April 26,
the Court sustained City’s demurrer to the fourth cause of action against it.  The granted leave to amend, but Plaintiff did
not amend.  
 
On April 28, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel
David Lynn filed his initial motion to be relieved as counsel. On May 31, the
Court continued the hearing to August 1, 2023, to allow counsel to remedy
procedural defects in the motion.  
 
On June 16, 2023, the two OSCs and the TSC
were continued to August 1.
 
On August 1, 2023, the Court denied the
motion to be relieved without prejudice, as counsel had not remedied the
procedural defects in the motion.  The
Court continued the two OSCs and the TSC.
 
On August 17, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel
filed his second motion to be relieved. 
The motion was again denied without prejudice based on procedural
defects.
 
On October 4, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel filed
his third motion to be relieved. Defendant City of Montebello has filed an
opposition and seeks, as affirmative relief, dismissal of the action. 
 
Legal
Standard (Motion to be Relieved)
 
The court may order that an attorney
be changed or substituted at any time before or after judgment or final
determination upon request by either client or attorney and after notice from
one to the other. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted
to withdraw where conflicts between the attorney and client make it
unreasonable to continue the representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof.
Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The determination whether to grant or deny a motion
to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as
counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and
Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be
served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the
case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay
effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy
of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has satisfied all of the procedural and substantive requirements for
the motion to be relieved. Counsel states that he has diligently attempted to
contact Plaintiff and that his most recent information is that Plaintiff has
departed from the United States and will not be returning to this country. (Lynn
Decl., ¶¶ 3-5.)  Counsel has shown good
cause to be relieved. The motion is GRANTED.
 
Defendant City’s request for affirmative relief is DENIED without
prejudice.  Defendant City may file its
own motion seeking relief.                      
 
Conclusion
 
The motion to
be relieved as counsel is GRANTED.
 
The order is
effective upon filing proof of service of the order, with all upcoming dates, on Plaintiff at his last
known address.
 
Trial is set
for a date in early March 2024.  Final
Status Conference and all deadlines are reset based on the new trial date.  The two OSCs are continued to the time of
trial.
 
Counsel for
Plaintiff to give notice.
