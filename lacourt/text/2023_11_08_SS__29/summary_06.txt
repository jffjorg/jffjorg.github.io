And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to continue the trial from December 11, 2023, to mid-September 2024. The reason for the continuance is that the defendant has not yet received responses to his discovery requests from the plaintiff and needs more time to conduct his investigation and prepare for trial. The judge finds that there is good cause to continue the trial, as the defendant would be prejudiced if the trial occurred before his pending motions to compel the plaintiff's responses to his discovery could be heard. The judge also notes that the defendant's office reserved hearings for motions to compel the discovery, but the first available date was after the current trial date.
