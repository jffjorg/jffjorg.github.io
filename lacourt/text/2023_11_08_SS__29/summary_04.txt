And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Plaintiff's counsel, David Lynn. The judge finds that counsel has satisfied all procedural and substantive requirements for the motion and has shown good cause to be relieved. The judge is aware that Plaintiff has departed from the United States and will not be returning to this country, making it unreasonable to continue the representation. The judge also denies Defendant City's request for affirmative relief, seeking dismissal of the action, without prejudice. The trial is set for early March 2024, and all upcoming dates, including the two OSCs, are continued to the time of trial. The judge orders that the motion to be relieved as counsel is effective upon filing proof of service of the order with all upcoming dates on Plaintiff at his last known address.
