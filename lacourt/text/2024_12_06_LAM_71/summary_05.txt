And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the unopposed motion of the defendants (Rosalina R. Payes, Bryan J. Garcia, and Reginaldo D. Garcia) to compel the plaintiff (Dulce Lopez-Rivera, individually and as GAL for Nicole Luna) to provide verified responses to their Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Request for Production (Set One). The plaintiff had previously requested a 30-day discovery extension, but had not provided the signed verifications and verified responses to the discovery requests.

The judge has also awarded sanctions in the amount of $217.50 against the plaintiff and her counsel (Margaret M. Kame, Esq. of Mark H. Aprahamian, P.C.) for their failure to comply with the discovery requests. The sanctions are payable within 20 days of the order.

The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.210, et seq. and 2031.210, et seq., which govern discovery in civil cases. The judge notes that the motion was unopposed, and therefore did not require a full hearing.
