And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for a default judgment and has instead set a hearing to determine why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or the plaintiff's counsel should be sanctioned for failing to enter a default judgment. The hearing is scheduled for January 10, 2025, at 8:30 AM. The judge's decision is based on two reasons: first, the declarant did not submit exhibits with authenticated foundation in support of the amount of damages sought; and second, the interest calculation provided does not provide an explanation for the starting date used to calculate the total interest sought.
