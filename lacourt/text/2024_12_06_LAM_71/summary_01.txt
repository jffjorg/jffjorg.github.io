And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Cross-Defendant Hormoz Pourat's motion to transfer the title of the Subject Property and his motion to file a motion seeking damages of $1,000,000 from his brother's will. The judge ruled that Cross-Defendant does not have standing to amend the Complaint because he is not a plaintiff in the original Complaint. The judge also noted that the entry of default against Cross-Defendant in March 2023 deprives the court of jurisdiction to consider any motions except for a motion for relief from default. The judge cited two California court cases, Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc. (1984) and W.A. Rose Co. v. Municipal Court for Oakland-Piedmont Judicial District, Alameda County (1959), in support of this ruling.
