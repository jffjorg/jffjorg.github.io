* The court finds that the third cause of action for IIED is not dependent on the alleged text message communication
* The court concludes that the first cause of action is based on a pre-litigation communication made in anticipation of litigation, which is protected activity under CCP ยง 425.16 (e)(2)

**Conclusion**

* The court grants the defendant's special motion to strike the first cause of action for extortion
