BACKGROUND:
 
On April 28, 2022,
Big Bus Tours Los Angeles, Inc. (“BBTLA”) filed its Complaint against Starline
Tours of Hollywood, Inc. (“Starline”) on causes of action for unfair
competition (statutory and common law), intentional interference with
prospective economic advantage, and false advertising. 
 
On June 8, 2022, the
Court found related cases 19STCV36480 and 22STCV14150, and designated
19STCV36480 as the lead case. 
 
On October 31, 2022,
the Court sustained Starline’s Demurrer to the Complaint’s third cause of
action for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. 
 
On December 7, 2022,
Starline filed: (1) Answer to the Complaint; and (2) Cross-Complaint against
BBTLA, Vector Media South, LLC, Vector Media Holding Corp., Big Bus Tours,
Ltd., Julia Conway, Patrick Waterman, Marc Borzykowski, Justin Steinfelder,
Robert Gutierrez, Open Top Sightseeing USA, and Sprint. 
 
On April 20, 2023,
Starline filed its First Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC). 
 
On May 25, 2023, the
Court ordered Starline to serve further responses to certain requests for
production of documents (“RPDs”) and special interrogatories (“SROGs”) within 14
days. 
 
On July 13, 2023, the
Court dismissed with prejudice Big Bus Tours, Ltd., Julia Conway, Patrick
Waterman, Open Top Sightseeing USA, Vector Media South, LLC, Vector Media
Holding Corp., Marc Borzykowski, Justin Steinfelder, and Robert Gutierrez from
the FACC. The Court also sustained BBTLA’s Demurrer to the FACC’s sixth cause
of action for fraud and conspiracy, abating that cause of action because there
was another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of
action. 
 
On April 2, 2024,
BBTLA filed its Answer to the FACC.
 
On April 5, 2024,
BBTLA filed its Motion to Compel Compliance with Agreement to Produce
Responsive Documents and Request for Sanctions (“Motion to Compel Compliance”).
In support of its Motion to Compel Compliance, BBTLA concurrently filed
Declaration of Joseph B. Weiner. 
 
On April 24, 2024,
Starline filed its Opposition to the Motion to Compel Compliance. Starline’s
Opposition includes a Request for Monetary Sanctions. 
 
On April 25, 2024,
Starline filed its Notice of Errata Re Opposition to the Motion to Compel
Compliance. 
 
On April 30, 2024,
BBTLA filed its Reply in support of the Motion to Compel Compliance. 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal
Standard
 
“The party to whom a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling has been directed shall
respond separately to each item or category of item by any of the following:
 
“(1) A statement that the party will comply
with the particular demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling by the
date set for the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling pursuant to paragraph
(2) of subdivision (c) of Section 2031.030 and any related activities.
 
“(2) A representation that the party lacks
the ability to comply with the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling of a particular item or category of item.
 
“(3) An objection to the particular demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.210, subd. (a).)
 
“If a party filing a
response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling under
Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280 thereafter fails
to permit the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling in accordance with that
party’s statement of compliance, the demanding party may move for an order
compelling compliance.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320, subd. (a).)
 
“Except as provided in
subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel compliance with a demand,
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320, subd. (b).)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
A. 
    The Parties’ Arguments
 
BBTLA moves the Court to: (1) compel Starline to produce documents in
response to various RPDs; (2) compel Starline to produce a production log or
otherwise sufficiently identify the specific documents requests to which the
documents respond; (3) issue monetary sanctions in favor of BBTLA and against
Starline; and (4) advise Starline that any failure to comply with this order
will result in further monetary sanctions and, if applicable, issue sanctions,
evidence, sanctions, and/or terminating sanctions. (Motion to Compel
Compliance, p. 16:9–21.)
 
Starline opposes the Motion to Compel Compliance, arguing: (1) that the
Motion to Compel Compliance must be denied because BBTLA has not established
that Starline violated Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.320; (2) that
BBTLA’s request for four separate orders is without merit; and (3) that BBTLA’s
request for sanctions should be denied and that sanctions should be granted in
favor of Starline instead. (Opposition, pp. 6:5–6, 6:22–23, 14:7–8.)
 
In its Reply, BBTLA argues: (1) that Starline produced virtually no
responsive communications; (2) that Starline did not produce additional
required materials; (3) that Starline mischaracterizes the Court’s prior Order
and the nature of the Motion to Compel Compliance; and (4) that the Court
should sanction Starline. (Reply, pp. 5:12–13, 6:16–17, 7:8–9, 9:9.)
 
B. 
    The Discovery Requests
 
On July 1, 2022, BBTLA served Starline with BBTLA’s “Requests for
Production of Documents to Defendant, Starline Tours of Hollywood, Inc. (Set
One)” (“RPDs, Set One”). (Decl. Weiner, Exh. A.)
 
On April 5, 2023, BBTLA served Starline with BBTLA’s “Requests for
Production of Documents to Defendant, Starline Tours of Hollywood, Inc. (Set
Two)” (“RPDs, Set Two”). (Decl. Weiner, Exh. I.)
 
On June 14, 2023, Starline served BBTLA with its most recent responses to
RPDs, Set One (“Third Supplemental Responses to RPDs, Set One”). (Decl. Weiner,
Exh. H.)
 
On August 11, 2023, Starline served BBTLA with its most recent responses
to RPDs, Set Two (“Supplemental Responses to RPDs, Set Two”). (Decl. Weiner,
Exh. J.)
 
Now, BBTLA seeks an order that would compel Starline to comply with its
statements of compliance. Thus, the fundamental issue before the Court is
determining whether Starline has not complied with its statements of
compliance. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320, subd. (a).)
 
BBTLA seeks compliance with specific RPDs: Nos. 2–7, 16–19, and 21 from
RPDs, Set One; and Nos. 24 and 26–29, from RPDs, Set Two. (Motion to Compel
Compliance, p. 16:9–12.) 
 
Notably, Starline’s Third Supplemental Responses to RPDs, Set One were
that Starline “will comply with this demand.” (Decl. Weiner, Exh. H.)
Starline’s Supplemental Responses to RPDs, Set Two were that Starline “will
produce non-privileged documents responsive to this request to the extent they
exist and are in the [Starline’s] custody, possession or control, subject to
entry of the protective order in this case.” (Decl. Weiner, Exh. J.) These were
all statements that Starline would comply, not that Starline could lacked the
ability to comply or objected to compliance. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.210,
subd. (a).)
 
The RPDs at issue request various documents and communications. For
example, some of these RPDs request: all communications between Starline and
the California Air Resources Board (CARB) since January 1, 2014 (RPD No. 5);
all documents and communications referring to any costs incurred by Starline
since January 1, 2019 to comply with CARB regulations (RPD No. 21); and
documents sufficient to identify the serial number and engine family name for
every engine in each vehicle that Starline has operated on a hop-on, hop-off
route in California since January 1, 2019 (RPD No. 24).
 
Starline points to 6,875 pages of documents that it has produced in support
of the proposition that Starline has complied with the RPDs. (Opposition, pp.
6:16–18, 7:20–11:12.) Such documents include “letters from CARB and email chain
regarding class to comply with CARB”, “all CA and Utah DMV records”, and “bus
files and maintenance and related records for at least 46 buses and email chain
regarding class to comply with CARB.” (Ibid.) Starline claims that it
“has produced all documents responsive to Request Nos. 2–7, 16–19, and 21 in
the First RFPs” and “produced all non-privileged materials responsive to
Requests Nos. 24 and 26–29”, such that there “there is nothing else to
produce.” (Id. at pp. 2:26–3:4.)
 
        In response, BBTLA points to various
categories of documents that have not yet been produced, including but not
limited to: (1) Starline’s internal communications; (2) Starline’s
communications with third parties other than CARB; and (3) Starline’s documents
that identify costs associated with CARB compliance. (Reply, p. 6:8–11,
6:18–24.)
 
        The Court finds that Starline has not
fully complied with its statements of compliance. The Court shall order
Starline to comply with its statements of compliance. 
 
C. 
    Ancillary Issues
 
        First, Starline claims that there was a
lack of meet and confer before BBTLA filed this motion. (Opposition, p. 4:26.)
While the Court encourages the Parties to engage in meet and confer prior to
filing discovery motions, as well as to engage in informal discovery
conferences, no meet and confer was required for this motion. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.320.)
 
        Second, Starline claims that the
deadlines to file motions to compel further responses have expired.
(Opposition, p. 4:17.) Yet BBTLA correctly notes that a motion for an order
compelling compliance pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.320(a) is
not subject to a time limit on when it can be requested. (Reply, p. 5, fn. 5.)
There does not appear to be a timeliness issue here in requesting compliance.
The Court notes that the deadlines in Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.020
still apply. 
 
        Finally, the Court’s Minute Order dated
May 25, 2023 ordered Starline “to serve responses to the RPDs as modified
within 14 days of the issuance of this Order.” (Minute Order dated May 25,
2023, p. 16.) Starline argues that BBTLA “is disingenuously misrepresenting the
May 25, 2023 Order to claim that production of documents were also ordered. The
text of the May 25, 2023 Order proves [BBTLA’s] position is without merit as
Starline was ordered only to provide responses. Starline has already complied with
the order as issued and no more is required to be done. [BBTLA’s] request is
without merit.” (Opposition, p. 2:16–25.) The Court hereby clarifies that
Starline is ordered to produce all documents responsive to the RPDs at issue. 
 
 
D. 
    Monetary Sanctions
 
BBTLA requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,500.00. (Motion to
Compel Compliance, pp. 15–16.) BBTLA’s Counsel declares that they have incurred
“well over $10,000 reviewing Starline’s document production and preparing this
motion.” (Decl. Weiner, ¶ 32.)
 
        Starline requests $1,900.00 in monetary
sanctions. (Opposition, p. 14:16–21.) Starline’s Counsel declares that this is
based on four hours of attorney work at $475.00 per hour. (Opposition, Decl.
Vivonia, ¶ 9.)
 
As BBTLA has
successfully made the motion and Starline has unsuccessfully opposed it without
substantial justification, monetary sanctions are appropriate in favor of BBTLA
and not for Starline. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.320, subd. (b).) The Court notes that monetary sanctions are for this
motion, not for violation of the Minute Order dated May 25, 2023. (The Court
makes no order today regarding any possible further sanctions, including
evidentiary, issue, and/or terminating sanctions.) 
 
It is not
uncommon for courts to compare opposing counsel’s fees to help determine
whether the moving party’s fees are reasonable. That is because a “comparative
analysis of each side’s respective litigation costs may be a useful check on
the reasonableness of any fee request.”¿¿(Mountjoy v. Bank of Am., N.A.¿(2016)
245 Cal.App.4th 266, 273, 281, quoting Donahue v. Donahue¿(2010) 182
Cal.App.4th 259, 272.)¿
 
“[T]here is
one particularly good indicator of how much time is necessary [for the purpose
of determining reasonableness of attorneys’ fees] . . . and that is how much
time the other side’s lawyers spent. . . . [S]uch a comparison is a useful
guide in evaluating the appropriateness of time claimed. If the time claimed by
the prevailing party is of a substantially greater magnitude than what the
other side spent, that often indicates that too much time is claimed.
Litigation has something of the tennis game, something of war, to it; if one
side hits the ball, or shoots heavy artillery, the other side necessarily
spends time hitting the ball or shooting heavy artillery back.” (Democratic
Party of Washington State v. Reed (9th¿Cir. 2004) 388 F.3d 1281, 1287.)
 
Here, BBTLA states
that it has “incurred well over $10,000 reviewing Starline’s document production
and preparing this motion”  although it
is requesting only $2,500 in attorney's fees (Weiner Declaration, ¶ 32; Motion to Compel Compliance, pp. 15–16.)  The
Court notes that attorney's fees are not available for time spent in reviewing document
production, and that BBTLA does not indicate its attorneys’ hourly rates or how
much time it spent on this motion to compel. 
Starline has requested $1,900.00 in attorney’s fees. The Court agrees
with Starline that $1,900.00 in attorney’s fees is appropriate here and will
award that amount.
