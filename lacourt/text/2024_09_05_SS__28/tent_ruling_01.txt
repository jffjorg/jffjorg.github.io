Evid. Code, §§ 452, subd. (d), 453.) 
LEGAL STANDARDS 
A.   Demurrer 
“The party against whom a complaint or cross-complaint
has been filed may object, by demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430.30,
to the pleading on any one or more of the following grounds: 
* * *
 “(e) The pleading does not state facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action. 
“(f) The pleading is uncertain. As used in this
subdivision, “uncertain” includes ambiguous and unintelligible. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10,
subds. (e), (f).) 
In a
demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading
or by judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a) [“When any
ground for objection to a complaint, cross-complaint, or answer appears on the
face thereof, or from any matter of which the court is required to or may take
judicial notice, the objection on that ground may be taken by a demurrer to the
pleading”].) 
“For
the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer
admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded (i.e., all ultimate
facts alleged, but not conclusions, deductions, or conclusions of facts or
law).”  (L. Edmon and C. Karnow, Cal.
Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2024) ¶ 7:43, p. 7(l)-25,
emphasis omitted (Cal. Practice Guide).)  
"A
demurrer may be filed to one of several causes of action in the complaint,
without answering the other causes of action."  (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 7:34.1,
p. 7(l)-19.) 
“
‘To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to
state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part
of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.’ ” (Cal. Practice Guide, supra,
¶ 7:40, p. 7(l)-21, quoting C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School
Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) 
“It
is not necessary that the cause of action be the one intended by
plaintiff.  The test is whether the
complaint states any valid claim entitling plaintiff to relief.  Thus, plaintiff may be mistaken as to the
nature of the case, or the legal theory on which plaintiff can prevail.  But if the essential facts of some
valid cause of action are alleged, the complaint is good against a general
demurrer.” (Cal. Practice Guide, supra,
¶ 7:41, p. 7(l)-22, original emphasis.) 
B.   Premises liability 
“The
elements of a . . . premises liability claim are . . . : a legal duty of care,
breach of that duty, and proximate cause resulting in injury.” (Kesner v.
Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1159.) 
“Landowners
under California law are required to maintain land in their possession and
control in a reasonably safe condition.” 
(Williams v. Fremont Corners, Inc. (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 654, 663
(Williams), citing Ann M. v. Pacific Plaza Shopping Center (1993)
6 Cal.4th 666, 674 (Ann M.).) 
“The underlying principle, set forth in Civil Code section 1714,
subdivision (a), is that “‘[e]veryone is responsible ... for an injury
occasioned to another by his or her want of ordinary care or skill in the management
of his or her property or person . . . .’” (Ibid.)  This rule “‘establishes the general duty of
each person to exercise, in his or her activities, reasonable care for the
safety of others.’” (Ibid., quoting Vasilenko v. Grace Family Church
(2017) 3 Cal.5th 1077, 1083 (Vasilenko); see Brown v. USA Taekwondo
(2021) 11 Cal.5th 204, 214 (Brown).) 
“A
defendant's control over property is sufficient to create a duty to protect
owed to persons using the property.” (Colonial Van & Storage, Inc. v.
Superior Court (2022) 76 Cal.App.5th 487, 497, citing Alcaraz v. Vece
(1997) 14 Cal.4th 1149, 1162, 1166; Soto v. Union Pacific Railroad Co.
(2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 168, 177 (Soto) [“the rationale being that whoever
has the means to control the property can take steps to prevent the harm”].)
“Conversely, absent any control of the property, a defendant cannot be held
liable for a dangerous condition on that property.” (Ibid., citing Cody
F. v. Falletti (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 1232, 1241 [“ ‘[t]he law does not
impose responsibility where there is no duty because of the absence of a right
to control’ ”]; Soto, supra, 45 Cal.App.5th at p. 177; Vasilenko,
supra, 3 Cal.5th at p. 1084 [generally, there is no right to control
another's property].) 
“
‘In premises liability cases, summary judgment may properly be granted where a
defendant unequivocally establishes its lack of ownership, possession, or
control of the property alleged to be in a dangerous or defective condition.’ ”
(Seaber v. Hotel Del Coronado (1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 481, 487, quoting Gray
v. America West Airlines, Inc. (1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 76, 81; Isaacs v.
Huntington Memorial Hospital (1985) 38 Cal.3d 112, 134.) 
“ ‘
“ ‘Courts ... invoke[ ] the concept of duty to limit generally “the otherwise
potentially infinite liability which would follow from every negligent act
....” ’ ” ’ ” (Williams, supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at p. 663, quoting
Vasilenko, supra, 3 Cal.5th at p. 1083.) “Our Supreme Court has
explained that an exception to the general rule of Civil Code section 1714 must
be “ ‘ “ ‘clearly supported by public policy.’ ” ’ ” (Ibid., quoting Vasilenko,
supra, 3 Cal.5th at p. 1083.) “Courts look to what are commonly called
‘the Rowland factors’ in determining whether policy considerations favor
such an exception.” (Ibid., citing Vasilenko, supra, 3
Cal.5th at p. 1083.)  “These are “ ‘ “the
foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff, the degree of certainty that the
plaintiff suffered injury, the closeness of the connection between the
defendant's conduct and the injury suffered, the moral blame attached to the
defendant's conduct, the policy of preventing future harm, the extent of the
burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to
exercise care with resulting liability for breach, and the availability, cost,
and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.” (Rowland [v. Christian
(1968)] 69 Cal.2d [108,] 113, 70 Cal.Rptr. 97, 443 P.2d 561 [(Rowland)].)’
” (Ibid., quoting Vasilenko, supra, 3 Cal.5th at p. 1083.) 
In
considering the Rowland factors, the court “determine[s] ‘not whether
they support an exception to the general duty of reasonable care on the facts
of the particular case before us, but whether carving out an entire category of
cases from that general duty rule is justified by clear considerations of
policy.’ ”  (Regents of University of
California v. Superior Court (2018) 4 Cal.5th 607, 629.)  
DISCUSSION 
A.  
Plaintiffs’
second amended complaint 
The second
amended complaint (“SAC”) alleges in part: 
On
September 26, 2020, Graham was driving Lavariere’s Porsche with Lavariere’s
consent.  Lavariere was a passenger in
the vehicle.  Due to Graham’s and Lavariere’s
negligence, Graham made an illegal left turn out of real property located in
Long Beach (“the premises”) and crossed the westbound lanes of Pacific Coast
Highway in Long Beach, intending to turn into the eastbound lanes of Pacific
Coast Highway.  The motorcycle that
Plaintiffs’ decedent, Patrick Mora (“decedent”), was driving westbound on
Pacific Coast Highway struck the Porsche, fatally injuring decedent. 
The
second amended complaint defines the premises as “certain real property located
generally at: 4525 East East [sic] Pacific Coast Highway Long Beach, CA 90804,
and 2511 East Pacific Coast Highway Long Beach, CA 90804 . . . .”  (SAC ¶ 6.) 
PCH owned,
“designed, developed and conveyed [the premises], [and] maintained the [premises]
in a dangerous condition as it relates to the exit onto East Pacific Coast
Highway, including but, not limited to: failing to maintain a ‘No Left Turn
Sign,’ as well as other construction and/or design defects.”  (SAC ¶ 74.) 
“Plaintiffs
allege that . . . on or about, November 13, 2017, Defendants VASU SPE 1, LLC,
as to a 35.3% and VASU SPE 2, LLC, and 64.7%, purchased from [PCH] [its]
portion of the Premises, and respectively, were partners in their designated
portion of the ownership of the real property and operated a Rite-Aid Store
located at: 4525 East East [sic] Pacific Coast
Highway Long Beach, CA 90804.”  (SAC ¶ 14.) 

After
the purchase, Vasu Defendants “continued to maintain the Property in a
dangerous condition as it relates to the Premises exit onto East Pacific Coast
Highway, through negligent or wrongful acts or omissions created, or allowed to
be created, or to continue in a dangerous condition in that Defendants,
negligently, unreasonably and improperly allowed a dangerous condition to exist
on their premises by having a driveway that directed drivers leaving the
property the property to either turn
right (West) or turn left (East) onto East Pacific Coast Highway, with a left
turn being illegal as the driver would be going the ‘wrong way’ and have to
cross two sets of double yellow lines more than two feet apart to go Eastbound
on East Pacific Coast Highway in violation of California Vehicle Code §§ 21651,
21804(a), et seq.” (SAC ¶ 15.) 
Vasu
Defendants “failed to prohibit left turns from the driveway . . . by failing to
install on the Premises near the exit, a right turn only or no left-hand turn
sign at the driveway of the apartment complex, or to cause to install at the
exit, a concrete driveway triangle island in order to channelize right turns,
and discourage or prohibit one or both left turns.” (SAC ¶ 16.)  B.   Plaintiffs’ notice of errata and amended notice of errata
In
Plaintiffs’ May 6, 2024 notice of errata,
Plaintiffs stated: “Due to clerical error, Plaintiffs’ Second Amended
Complaint, at paragraphs 6, 22, and 72 through 76, references a dangerous
condition having existed at the property located at 2511 East Pacific Coast
Highway, Long Beach, CA 90804, among others. The correct address where the
dangerous is alleged to have existed is 4511 East Pacific Coast Highway, Long
Beach, CA 90804.” 
In
Plaintiffs’ August 22, 2024 amended notice of errata, Plaintiffs stated: 
“Due to clerical error, Plaintiffs’ Second Amended
Complaint, at paragraphs 6, 22, and 72 through 76, references property located
at 2511 East Pacific Coast Highway, Long Beach, CA 90804. The correct address
should be 4511 East Pacific Coast Highway, Long Beach, CA 90804. The Second
Amended Complaint is to otherwise remain the same. “Specifically, all allegations as to Defendants VASU
SPE 1, LLC and VASU SPE 2, LLC, owning property and/or operating a business
located at 4525 East Pacific Coast Highway, Long Beach, CA 90804, remain in the
Second Amended Complaint.”  (Bold and
underlining omitted.) 
C.  
Vasu
Defendants’ demurrer 
Vasu
Defendants assert that Plaintiffs’ May 6, 2024 notice of errata established
that the only “dangerous condition” alleged in the complaint was located at
4511 East Pacific Coast Highway, Long Beach, CA 90804.  According to Vasu Defendants, the second
amended complaint does not allege any facts showing that they have a connection
with that address.  Instead, the second
amended complaint alleges that Vasu Defendants operated a Rite-Aid store located
at 4525 East Pacific Coast Highway, Long Beach, CA 90804.  As a result of the May 6, 2024 notice of
errata, Vasu Defendants contend, 4525 East Pacific Coast Highway is no longer
part of the “premises” at issue. 
In
response, Plaintiffs argue that the May 6, 2024 notice of errata replaced only
2511 East Pacific Coast Highway with 4511 East Pacific Coast Highway.  The notice of errata did not mention 4525
East Pacific Coast Highway and did not exclude that address from the second
amended complaint’s definition of the “premises.”  Plaintiffs confirmed this understanding in
their August 22, 2024 amended notice of errata. 
The Court
finds that the second amended complaint adequately pleads Plaintiffs’ premises liability
claim against the Vasu Defendants, including facts alleging their ownership, possession, or control of the “premises” at issue.  
The
Court does not consider the new arguments raised in Vasu Defendants’ reply
brief. 
The
Court overrules the demurrer. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court OVERRULES the demurrer filed by Defendants VASU SPE 1, LLC and VASU SPE 2, LLC to the premises liability claim in the
second amended complaint filed by Plaintiffs Darrin Mora and Lisa Mora. 
Moving
parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
parties are ordered to file proof of service of this ruling within five days.
