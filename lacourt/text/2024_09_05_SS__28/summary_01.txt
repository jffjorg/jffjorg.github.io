As for the English text summary, I can provide one:

The Judge has considered the demurrer filed by Vasu Defendants to the premises liability claim in the second amended complaint filed by Plaintiffs Darrin Mora and Lisa Mora. The Vasu Defendants argued that the second amended complaint does not adequately plead the premises liability claim against them, citing the notice of errata filed by Plaintiffs on May 6, 2024, which replaced the address 2511 East Pacific Coast Highway with 4511 East Pacific Coast Highway. However, the Judge finds that the second amended complaint still adequately pleads the premises liability claim against Vasu Defendants, including facts alleging their ownership, possession, or control of the "premises" at issue. The Judge overrules the demurrer and allows the premises liability claim to proceed against Vasu Defendants.
