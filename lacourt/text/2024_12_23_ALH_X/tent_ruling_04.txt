 Case Number:  24NNCV02442    Hearing Date:   December 23, 2024    Dept:  X MOTION
TO STRIKE DEFENDANT’S AMENDED ANSWERPlaintiff moves to strike Defendant’s amended answer.  No opposition is filed.This case arises
from a motor vehicle accident in which Plaintiff Jing Tong alleges that
Defendant Helena H. Arutunyan negligently caused a head-on collision, resulting
in Plaintiff’s physical and emotional injuries.  The complaint asserts one cause of action for
negligence.Defendant filed an
amended answer on September 12, 2024, asserting two affirmative defenses: (1) apportionment
and (2) failure to mitigate damages.  Plaintiff
filed a motion to strike these affirmative defenses under Code of Civil
Procedure sections 435 and 436, arguing that both defenses are legally
insufficient, fail to state facts, and are uncertain, ambiguous, and
unintelligible.Tentative RulingPlaintiff’s motion
to strike Defendant’s September 13, 2024 amended answer is GRANTED.  The first and second affirmative defenses are
stricken in their entirety.  Defendant is
granted 10 days leave to file and serve a Second Amended Answer.    Legal Standard and
AnalysisUnder Code of Civil
Procedure section 435, “Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a
pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part
thereof.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 435, subd.
(b)(1).)  Code of Civil Procedure section
436 provides as follows: 
“The court may, upon a motion made pursuant to Section 435, or at any
time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper:
(a) Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any
pleading.
(b) Strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the
court.”
(Code Civ. Proc., §
436.)  In ruling on a motion to strike,
the court must assume the truth of the properly pleaded facts in the complaint
or other pleading.  (Turman v. Turning
Point of Central California, Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.)The Court finds that
the meet and confer requirement is met.  (Tong
Decl., ¶¶ 5, 8.)  Plaintiff contends that
the first affirmative defense (apportionment) lacks factual support and fails
to identify any individuals allegedly responsible for apportionment.  Plaintiff also argues that the second
affirmative defense (failure to mitigate damages) is inapplicable because the
complaint does not allege economic damages, and the defense is unsupported by
factual allegations.Under section 436,
the Court may strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in
a pleading or any part of a pleading not drawn in conformity with the laws of
the state.  Affirmative defenses must be specially
pleaded in an answer (notwithstanding the general rule favoring liberal
construction of pleadings).  (Houk v.
Williams Bros. (1943) 58 Cal.App.2d 573, 582.)  Affirmative
defenses cannot simply spout “terse legal conclusions” but must state
supporting facts “as carefully and with as much detail” as is required in a
complaint.  (FPI Devel., Inc. v.
Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 384.)  Allegations stating a legal conclusion (rather
than pleading facts) are inadequate.  (Berger
v. California Ins. Guar. Assn. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 989, 1006; Jones
v. Grewe (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 950, 954.)First Affirmative Defense: ApportionmentDefendant’s first
affirmative defense asserts that liability should be apportioned among all
defendants according to their relative degrees of fault.  However, the defense fails to identify any
specific individuals or entities whose fault should be apportioned.  It also does not provide any factual
allegations to support the claim that other parties contributed to Plaintiff’s
damages.  This lack of specificity warrants
the striking of the affirmative defense.Second Affirmative Defense: Failure to
Mitigate DamagesThe second
affirmative defense alleges that Plaintiff failed to mitigate her damages.  However, Plaintiff’s complaint does not allege
economic damages, such as lost income, that would require mitigation.  Therefore, the defense is irrelevant to the
claims at issue.  Moreover, the defense
is unsupported by any factual allegations. It merely states a broad legal
conclusion without identifying how Plaintiff allegedly failed to mitigate her
damages or what specific actions she should have taken.ConclusionFor the reasons stated above,
the Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to strike in its entirety.  Leave to amend Defendant’s answer is granted,
with Defendant having 10 days to file and serve a Second Amended Answer.
Defendant must serve her answer on Plaintiff as well as filing it with the Court.
