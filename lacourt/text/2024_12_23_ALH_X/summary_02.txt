And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages from the plaintiff's complaint. The motion was based on the argument that the plaintiff did not state a prima facie claim for punitive damages. However, the judge found that the plaintiff's allegations were sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages, as they alleged that the defendant had knowledge of the dog's viciousness and propensity to attack, and that the defendant's conduct was with a willful and conscious disregard for the safety of others. The judge noted that the statute requires that punitive damages be alleged with specificity, and that the plaintiff's allegations meet this requirement. Therefore, the motion to strike punitive damages is denied.
