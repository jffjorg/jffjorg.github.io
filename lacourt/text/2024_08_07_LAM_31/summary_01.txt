And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is about a wrongful death action filed by April Dickson, the spouse of Danny L. Dickson, who died from silicosis allegedly caused by exposure to Hardie board while working in the construction industry in Alabama. The defendant, James Hardie Building Products (JHBP), moved to quash service of summons, claiming lack of personal jurisdiction. The plaintiff argues that the court has specific jurisdiction over JHBP because it conducted research and development of silica-containing products, including Hardie board, in California. The court finds that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to establish JHBP's purposeful availment of California's benefits or whether the controversy is related to or arises out of JHBP's contacts in the forum. Therefore, the court grants the plaintiff's request for a continuance to allow for jurisdictional discovery.
