DEMURRER
WITHOUT MOTION TO STRIKE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Gloria Ramos  
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendants Gold
Value International Textile, et al.
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION

 
            This is an employment action.  Plaintiff Gloria Ramos (Ramos or Plaintiff) alleges
that her employers, Defendants Gold Value International Textile, Inc. (Gold
Value), BTFLLIFE, Inc. (BTFL), and Morris Ajnassian (Ajnassian) prevented her from
leaving work premises for her rest breaks and meal periods.  Further, when Plaintiff refused to attend a
holiday work party because of the meal and rest period violations, Ajnassian,
the chief executive officer of BTLF, became enraged and assaulted Plaintiff.  
 
On April 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against
Defendants alleging causes of action for (1) constructive discharge in
violation of public policy, (2) work environment harassment, (3) disparate
treatment, (4) meal period liability, (5) rest break liability, (6) failure to
provide accurate itemized wage statements, (7) waiting time penalties, (8)
violation of Business & Professions Code Section 17200 et seq., (9)
intentional infliction of emotional distress, and (10) negligent infliction of
emotional distress. 
 
On April 15, 2024, Defendants filed their Answer to the Complaint.  The Answer asserted a general denial and thirty-six
affirmative defenses.    
 
On May 31, 2024, Plaintiff filed this demurrer to Affirmative
Defenses Nos. 1-35 of the Answer.
 
Defendants filed an opposition.  Plaintiff did not file a reply.
 
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
            A demurrer to an answer may be
brought on one of three (3) grounds: (1) failure to state facts sufficient to
constitute a defense; (2) uncertainty; and (3) failure to state whether
contract alleged in the answer is written or oral.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.20.)
 
Affirmative
defenses should be relevant to a plaintiff’s legal claims and averred
carefully, with as much detail as the facts constituting the corresponding
causes of action in the complaint. (FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991)
231 Cal.App.3d 367, 384.) Affirmative defenses should not be proffered in the
form of “terse legal conclusions.” (Ibid.)
 
Upon sustaining a
demurrer, where a pleading can be reasonably cured by amendment, the trial
court abuses its discretion by not granting leave to amend. (Czajkowski v.
Haskell & White, LLP (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 166, 173.)
 
III.      DISCUSSION 
 
            Plaintiff’s demurrer is untimely.  Typically, a party who has filed a complaint
may, within 10 days after service of the answer to his pleading, demur to the
answer.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.40, subd. (b).)¿ 
 
            Here, Defendants filed and served their
Answer on April 15, 2024.  On April 25,
2024, Plaintiff filed a Declaration of Demurring or Moving Party in Support of Automatic
Extension.  Pursuant to the extension,
Plaintiff had an additional thirty days—until May 28, 2024 (accounting for
court holidays)—to file her demurrer.  However,
without explanation, Plaintiff filed this demurrer on May 31, 2024.  The filing is untimely.  
 
            Second, the notice of motion is
defective.  Plaintiff’s notice of motion
indicates she is moving “for an order to stay proceedings in [this] case.”  (See Notice of Motion, p. 1.)       
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff’s Demurrer to Affirmative Defenses Nos. 1-35 of
the Defendants’ Answer is OVERRULED.  
 
Clerk of the court to give notice.  
 
Dated:   August 7, 2024
