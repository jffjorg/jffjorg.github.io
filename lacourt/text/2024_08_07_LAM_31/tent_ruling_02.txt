I.
         INTRODUCTION
 
On January 8, 2024, Plaintiff, Enterprise Bank & Trust,
filed a Verified Complaint against 1427 15th Street, LLC; Adam Shekhter; Alan
Shekhter; Alexander Shekhter; Adam 3S Generational Trust dated December 3, 2018;
Adam GTS 2018, LLC; Alan 3S Generational Turst dated December 3, 2018; Alan GTS
2018, LLC; Alexander 3S Generational Trust dated December 3, 2018; and Alexander
GTS 2018, LLC, for (1) Judgment on Note, (2) Judgment on Guarantees, (3)
Specific Performance, (4) Appointment of Receiver, and (5) Injunctive Relief.  As alleged, Defendant 1427 15th Street LLC and
First Choice Bank[1] entered
into a Business Loan Agreement for a loan in the amount of $2,400,000.   Plaintiff
seeks to recover an unpaid balance on a construction loan owed by Defendants.  To secure the loan, Defendant executed and
delivered to First Choice Bank the following: (a) Promissory Note to pay First
Choice Bank the principal sum of $2,400,000, plus interest, (b) Deed of Trust
to the real property at 1427 15th Street, Santa Monica, CA 90404 (the
“Property”), and (c) Assignment of Rents, granting First Choice Bank a
“continuing security interest” in “right, title, and interest in and to the
Rents from the Property (collectively, the “Collateral”).  To further secure the loan obligations,
Defendants Adam Shekhter, Alan Shekhter, Alexander Shekhter, Adam 3S
Generational Trust, Adam GTS 2018, Alan 3S Generational Turst[2],
Alan GTS 2018, Alexander 3S Generational Trust, and Alexander GTS 2018
(“Guarantors”) delivered to First Choice Bank a written Commercial Guaranty
(the “Guarantees”) guaranteeing the performance and payment of Borrower’s
obligations under the Loan Agreement and Note. 
In September 2019, First Choice Bank fully funded the loan.  In December 2023, Defendant 1427 15th Street,
LLC defaulted on the loan.
 
Before the court are ten (10) applications for default
judgment and Plaintiff’s Motion for Appointment of a Receiver (the “Motion”).  The court proceeds by addressing Plaintiff’s
default judgment applications followed by the Motion.
 
II.        APPLICATIONS
FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 
A.   
Relevant Background
 
On March 15, 2024, the clerk of the court entered default
against Defendants, 1427 15th Street, LLC; Adam GTS 2018, LLC; Alan GTS 2018; Alexander
GTS 2018, LLC; Alexander Shekhter; Alexander 3S Generational Trust; Alan
Shekhter; Adam Shekhter; and Adam 3S Generational Trust.
 
On April 15, 2024, the clerk of the court entered default
against Defendant, Alan 3S Generational Turst.
 
On April 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed an Application for
Separate Default Judgment Pursuant to C.C.P. § 579 Against All Defendants and
concurrently filed ten (10 ) separate proposed judgments.  As indicated by the proposed judgments,
Plaintiff seeks default judgment against each defendant in the sum of $ 2,296,041.44, consisting of $2,204,309.07 in damages,
$83,890.25 in prejudgment interest at the annual rate of 5.17%, $2,079,40 in
costs, and $5,762.72 in late fees.
 
B.    
Analysis
 
1.     
Application
for Separate Default Judgment 
 
            Plaintiff’s
request for separate default judgment lacks merit.  Code of Civil Procedure section 579 states:
“In an action against several defendants, the court may, in its discretion,
render judgment against one or more of them, leaving the action to
proceed against the others, whenever a several judgment is proper.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 579, emphasis added.) “The
question of whether the court should render a judgment against a defaulting
defendant when there are several defendants is one that is entrusted to the
discretion of the court by the provisions of section 579 of the Code of Civil
Procedure.” (Morehouse v. Wanzo (1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 846, 852.) “Thus,
where one defendant defaults his default may be entered and a judgment rendered
against him, leaving the action to proceed as to the other defendants until the
injured party has received satisfaction, even though this results in different
judgments as to several defendants.” (Winzler & Kelly v. Superior Court (1975)
48 Cal.App.3d 385, 393.) 
 
            Here, default
has been entered against all named defendants.  Accordingly, the present procedural posture is
not one contemplated by Section 579, where default has been entered against one
or more defendants, and the plaintiff proceeds to trial against other
defendants.  (See, e.g., Morehouse,
supra, 266 Cal.App.2d at pp.848-49.) 
In other words, because all defendants have defaulted, this action is not
proceeding against any other non-defaulted defendants.   The request for separate default judgments is
DENIED.
 
2.     
Applications
for Default Judgment
 
Upon review, Plaintiff’s applications for default judgment
are defective for the following reasons:
 
-         
As discussed above, the court has
denied Plaintiff’s request for separate default judgments.  Accordingly, Plaintiff is ordered to serve
and file one proposed judgment naming all defaulted defendants and indicating
that defendants are jointly and severally liable.
-         
Plaintiff has not filed a Request
for Court Judgment on Form CIV-100. 
-         
Doe defendants have not been dismissed
from this action.
-         
Plaintiff seeks recovery of
unspecified attorney’s fees.  Plaintiff
is directed to include its attorney’s fees request in its application for
default judgment.  The attorney’s fees
must be calculated pursuant to LASC Local Rule 3.214.
 
C.    
Conclusion
 
The request for separate default judgments is DENIED.  The applications for default judgment are
DENIED without prejudice.
 
III.       MOTION FOR
APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVER
 
A.    Relevant Background  
 
On April 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed this Motion for
Appointment of a Receiver.   Plaintiff
seeks an order to appoint a receiver over Defendant 1427 15th Street LLC’s
assets (the “Collateral”).
 
The motion
is unopposed.
 
B.    
Legal Standard
 
The trial court is authorized to
appoint a receiver in “an action by a secured lender for specific performance
of an assignment of rents provision in a deed of trust, mortgage or separate
assignment document”; in “a case brought by an assignee under an assignment of
leases, rents, issues or profits”; and in “all other cases where necessary to
preserve the property or rights of any party.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 564,
subd. (b)(9), (11), (12).)
 
C.    
Application  
 
Plaintiff requests that the Court appoint a receiver to
mitigate loss in value and harm to the Property.  As explained by Plaintiff in its motion, the
Property was appraised to have an “as is” market value of $3,400,000.00
as of July 23, 2019, with an appraised prospective market value of
$3,600,000.00 upon completion of renovation to no less than three of ten units
in the Property.  Based on its current
condition, the owner set the Property’s asking price at $2,675,000.  Due to the lack of activity/interest in the
Property, the owner dropped the asking price to $2,300,00.00 over the past
couple of weeks.   Six of the ten units
are currently vacant, such that the Property is not producing a significant
amount in rent — only $3,592 of a possible $14,361 in rents is currently being
collected per month.  Additionally, there
is currently no adequate management overseeing the Property, putting the
Property at risk of further loss in value, of remaining vacant, of failing to
produce rents, and falling into disrepair for lack of proper oversight on
needed repairs, replacements, and maintenance necessary to preserve the value
of the Property.  In
support, Plaintiff submits the Loan Documents to establish Defendant
1427 15th Street, LLC’s obligations under the Loan and Plaintiff’s rights to the Collateral, including the Property and the rents to
be derived from the Property, (Complaint, ¶¶ 16-26,
Exs. 1-13), and the current state of the Property (Hustedt Decl., ¶¶ 20-22, Exs.
B, C.)   
 
Given that Defendant 1427 15th Street, LLC has defaulted on their
obligations on the loan, and indeed, have defaulted in this action, the Court
finds that the appointment of a receiver on the Property is warranted.  
D.   
Conclusion
The unopposed motion is
GRANTED.  Pursuant to Plaintiff’s
request, Stephen J. Donell is appointed the receiver for the
Collateral.   
IV.       DISPOSITIONS
1.     
Plaintiff’s Request for Default Judgment is
Denied.  Plaintiff’s Applications for
Default Judgment are Denied Without Prejudice. 
The Status Conference re: Default Judgment is Continued to October 4,
2024.  Plaintiff is to file an amended
application for default judgment consistent with this order.


2.     
Plaintiff’s Motion for Appointment of Receiver is
Granted.  Pursuant to Plaintiff’s
request, Stephen J. Donell is appointed the receiver for the
Collateral.   
Plaintiff to give notice.
 
Dated:   August 7, 2024
