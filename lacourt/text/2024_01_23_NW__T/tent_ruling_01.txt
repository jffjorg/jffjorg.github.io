  Case Number:  22VECV01170    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2024    Dept:  T 22VECV01170 Scalzo v Hyundai
Tentative ruling: 
Plaintiff’s Motion for sanctions denied.  The
deposition has been taken.  This motion is for terminating
sanctions.  It is unclear what the moving party believes would warrant
terminating sanctions.  Although the order for the deposition of Bailey
was disobeyed, it has since been completed and there are no claimed
prejudice.  Terminating sanctions are reserved for extreme discovery
misconduct.  Defendants has already been
sanctioned for previous discovery abuse.
Also, it is absolutely an unnecessary expense to have a
reporter set up for deposition when it was clearly stated in writing that the
witness would not appear.  It seems to be a practice among some attorneys
when there is no need to do so.  As the law is clear that the
non-appearance need not be recorded by a reporter, it was not a necessary
expense.
Concerning the trial, the court is currently engaged in a
jury trial which is planned to go to the second or third week of
February.  For now, the court will continue the FSC to the current trial
date of 1/31/2024 and will discuss the specifics of when this trial can start
at that time.  It is possible that the case may be transferred to another
court for trial.
The court requests that the parties waive notice.
