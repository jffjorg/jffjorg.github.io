 Case Number:  22VECV01240    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2024    Dept:  T 22VECV01240
Soto v Puretek
Tentative
ruling on ex parte application: Deny.  In
order to advance the date for a motion, it has to have been filed.  No motion has been filed. Accordingly, there
is nothing to advance.
The court
is aware of discussions about continuing the trial.  The court has stated multiple times that it
would not continue the trial.  Perhaps it
may continue trial to allow for this limited discovery as defendant had to be
ordered to produce the information.  However,
the court cannot think of any circumstances that would allow the court to grant
a 6 month continuance.  This case is already
17 months old and is on the verge of being out of compliance under the
CRC.  The court already denied the
request to continue by defendant on 12/18/2023. 
The order setting the trial was from 3/29/2023.
