Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel responses and production from the defendant, GENERAL MOTORS, LLC (GM). The court has granted the motion in part, ordering GM to provide verified, Code-compliant responses to certain requests for production. The court has also denied the motion in part, finding that GM's objections were frivolous and that GM engaged in discovery abuse without substantial justification. As a result, the court has ordered GM and its attorneys to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,310.00. The court has also ordered GM to provide the requested documents, which must be sequentially numbered with a key or log, within 15 days.
