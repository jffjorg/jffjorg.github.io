And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the ex parte application to advance the date of a motion. The application was denied because no motion has been filed, and therefore, there is nothing to advance. The Judge is also aware of discussions regarding the continuation of the trial, but has previously stated that it would not continue the trial. The Judge notes that the case is already 17 months old and is nearing the compliance deadline under the California Rules of Court (CRC). The Judge has previously denied the defendant's request to continue the trial and is unwilling to grant a 6-month continuance.
