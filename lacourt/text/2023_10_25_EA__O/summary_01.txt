```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the City's motion to compel further responses and production from West Coast Arborists & Inc. (WCA) in part, modifying Requests for Production (RFPs) 6 and 12 to require WCA to produce documents related to tree risk assessments and structural characteristics of Bradford Pear trees for the past 4 years in the cities of Rowland Heights, Walnut, Pomona, Chino, San Dimas, and La Verne. The judge denies RFPs 15 and 16 in their entirety, finding that they are overly broad and seeking everything in WCA's possession without adequate identification of the specific documents sought. The judge does not impose monetary sanctions on either party, as both parties have attempted to meet and confer in good faith.
