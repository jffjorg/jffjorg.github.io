And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses several issues related to discovery proceedings in a case involving WCA and the City of Diamond Bar. The Judge determines that the opposition's failure to address objections to work product is deemed waived and discoverable. WCA has provided the requested Tree Risk Assessment and conducted assessments on Bradford Pear Trees within the City of Diamond Bar. The Judge also determines that the interrogatories are relevant and not burdensome. The Judge rejects WCA's citations to case law, including Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1968), as inapplicable to the current situation. Finally, the Judge notes that the statutes referenced in Calcor were repealed to facilitate non-substantive reorganization of the rules governing civil discovery, and their repeal did not change the substantive requirements of the rules.
