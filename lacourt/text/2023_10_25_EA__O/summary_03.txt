Summary:

The tentative ruling addresses two main issues: the demurrer to the amended answer and the motion to strike certain affirmative defenses.

Regarding the demurrer, the court sustains the demurrer as to the 4th affirmative defense for Accord and Satisfaction, finding that it lacks sufficient ultimate facts and is pled as a legal conclusion rather than as facts.

Regarding the motion to strike, the court grants the motion as to the 5th COA (punitive damages by executor) and the 6th COA (punitive damages unconstitutional), but denies the motion in part as to the other grounds. The court finds that the 5th and 6th affirmative defenses are new matter and must be pled in the answer, and that the other affirmative defenses are not uncertain or ambiguous.
