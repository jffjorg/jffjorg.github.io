And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is a judge's preliminary thoughts on a pending court hearing. The judge is concerned about the defendants' citing of cases that cannot be found, even on other databases. The judge requests that the defendants file a request for judicial notice and produce the case. The judge also notes that the defendants' affirmative defenses have already been adjudicated and are not in conformity with California laws. The judge finds that a case cited by the defendants, Eagle Oil & Ref. Co v. Prentice, does not support the defendants' proposition that a court may strike punitive damages based on constitutional grounds. The judge seems to be signaling that the defendants need to provide more support for their arguments and that the court will require additional information before making a final ruling.
