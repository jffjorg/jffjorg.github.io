[1] The opposition does not adequately address objections
based upon work product; thus, they are deemed waived and discoverable. 


[2] WCA has provided all the Tree Risk Assessment
requested and conducted on Bradford Pear Trees within the City of Diamond Bar.

[3] To the extent that WCA cite to Columbia
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1968)
263 Cal.App.2d 12 (without an analysis) that case is inapposite as the
appellate court determined the interrogatories requiring the responding party to
state the source, date and the amount of each item of income, revenue and gross
receipts and each item of cost expended or incurred in connection with that
episode at issue were burdensome because the case was for plagiarism and
breach of contract, not an action for accounting. Here, however, the court has
determined that the interrogatories are relevant.
 


[4] WCA cites to three cases in support of its contention
that the RFPs are improper: Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997)
53 Cal.App.4th 216 (which the City addresses in Reply), Flora Crane Service
v. Superior Court (1965) 234 Cal.App.2nd 767, 786 [mistakenly cited as Flora
Can Service [sic]); Union Trust Co. v. Superior Court of San Diego
County (1938) 11 Cal.2d 449, 458.) 


[5] While the statutes referenced in Calcor were
repealed, they were repealed to facilitate non-substantive reorganization of
the rules governing civil discovery; the substantive requirements of the rules
have not changed.
