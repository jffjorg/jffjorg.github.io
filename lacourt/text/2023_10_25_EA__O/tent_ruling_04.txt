Defendants cite to a few cases that are found on Lexis. However, the court
could not find the cases, even on other databases. For future filings wherein
Defendants cite to cases provided only on Lexis, the court requests Defendants
to file a request for judicial notice and produce the case.

Motion p. 3:9-10 [“Moreover, some affirmative defenses were already
adjudicated, and a few are not in conformity with the laws of the State of
California”]; see also Reply p. 4:10-11 [“. But they are not new matter, as the
Defendants have mentioned all these matters several times over the past year
via demurrers.”].)

Defendants cite to Eagle Oil & Ref. Co v. Prentice (1942) 19 Cal.2d
553, 560 (Opp. p. 8) to support its proposition that a court may strike
punitive damages based on constitutional grounds, but the court finds no such
conclusion in the case.
