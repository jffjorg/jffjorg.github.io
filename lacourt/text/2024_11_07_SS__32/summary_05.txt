And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed three petitions for minors' compromise filed by Petitioners Carolina Valencia, Melissa Nieto, and Carolina Valencia (on behalf of Ava Mejia and Sofia Mejia). The court denies the petitions without prejudice due to various deficiencies.

Specifically, the court notes that Petitioner must provide the correct court address in the petition and proposed order, complete Item 3b instead of 3a, and provide further records or a parent declaration regarding the claimants' current condition. The court also requires Petitioner to provide attachment 11b3, attachment 12b5, and proof of fees and expenses incurred.

The court further notes that the medical records/reports attached do not show that the claimants are fully recovered from their injuries, and Petitioner must provide further records or a parent declaration regarding the claimants' current condition.

Additionally, the court finds that Petitioner's request for attorney fees is reasonable, but Petitioner must provide the fee agreement for all claimants.

The court encourages the parties to meet and confer to determine if a resolution can be reached. If a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit.
