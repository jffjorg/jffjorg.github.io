BACKGROUND
 
Defendant Louis Vuitton USA Inc. (“Defendant”) moves for terminating
sanctions against Plaintiff Amanda Pham (“Plaintiff”) for failure to comply
with the Court’s August 21, 2024 discovery order. Defendant also seeks monetary
sanctions. No opposition has been filed.[1] 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“To
the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method
or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected
party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may
impose…sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the
discovery process.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 2023.030.) The court may impose a
terminating sanction for misuse of the discovery process by any of the
following: “(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings
of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process; (2) An order
staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed; (3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that
party; (4) An order rendering a judgment by default against that party.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(d).)  Failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery, or
disobeying
a court order to provide discovery, constitutes a
misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d), (g).)

 
“The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse
‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the
party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the
propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the
discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th
377, 390, quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 1225,
1246.)   
 
“Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be
made lightly.  But where a violation is
willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’” (Los
Defensores, supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390 [citation
omitted].)    
 
“Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating
sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders.”
(Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 citing Lang,
supra, 77 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244-1246 [discussing cases]; see, e.g., Collisson
& Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622
[terminating sanctions imposed (by striking the defendant’s Answer and
subsequently granting default judgment) after defendants failed to comply with
one court order to produce discovery]; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins.
Exchange (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 481, 491, disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen (1997) 16 Cal.4th
469, 478, n. 4 [terminating sanctions imposed against the plaintiff for failing
to comply with a discovery order and for violating various discovery
statutes].)  
 
“If a party then fails to obey an order compelling answers [to
interrogatories], the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition
to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010).” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).) 
 
“If a party then fails to obey the order compelling a response [to a
demand for production], the court may make those orders that are just,
including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
lieu of or in addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
 
JUDICIAL
NOTICE
 
The Court grants Defendant’s requests for judicial notice. (Evid.
Code, § 452, subd. (d).)  
 
DISCUSSION
 
On
May 8, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be relieved,
effective upon filing proof of service of the order on Plaintiff. The proof of
service was filed on May 9, 2024. Plaintiff is currently
self-represented. 
 
On August
21, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s unopposed motion to deem admitted
Request for Admissions, Set One and imposed $457.50 in monetary sanctions. The
Court also granted Defendant’s unopposed motion to compel Request for
Production, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Form
Interrogatories, Set One. Plaintiff was ordered to provide verified responses
within 20 days. The Court also imposed $457.50 in monetary sanctions. (Min.
Order, 8/21/24.) On August 28, 2024, Defendant filed and mailed notice of
orders to Plaintiff’s address.
 
Defendant
now moves for terminating sanctions, arguing that Plaintiff has not complied
with the Court’s order by not serving responses and not paying the monetary
sanctions. 
 
Therefore,
based on Plaintiff’s failure to abide by the Court’s order, despite receiving
notice, the Court finds that Defendant is prevented from defending this case,
and that lesser sanctions have not induced compliance. Accordingly, the motion
for terminating sanctions is granted. Because terminating sanctions are
granted, the Court declines to award further monetary sanctions.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, Defendant Louis Vuitton USA Inc.’s motion for terminating
sanctions is GRANTED. The complaint, filed on 1/19/23, is dismissed with
prejudice as to Louis Vuitton USA Inc. At the hearing on this motion, Defendant
shall advise the Court as to whether it is seeking to dismiss its
cross-complaint with prejudice, or promptly file such a request.
 
Moving party shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a
proof of service of such.
