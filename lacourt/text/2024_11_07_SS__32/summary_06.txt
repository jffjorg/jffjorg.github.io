Significant Statements:
  - "The court may impose a terminating sanction for misuse of the discovery process by any of the following: (1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process; (2) An order staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is obeyed; (3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that party; (4) An order rendering a judgment by default against that party." (Code Civ. Proc. ยง 2023.030(d).)
  - "Generally, '[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.'" (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez, supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390 [citation omitted].)
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions against the plaintiff for failing to comply with the court's discovery order. The court found that the plaintiff failed to serve responses to the defendant's requests for discovery and failed to pay monetary sanctions, despite receiving notice. The judge concluded that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the court's order was willful and that lesser sanctions had not induced compliance. Therefore, the court granted the motion for terminating sanctions, dismissing the complaint with prejudice as to the defendant. The court also declined to award further monetary sanctions.
