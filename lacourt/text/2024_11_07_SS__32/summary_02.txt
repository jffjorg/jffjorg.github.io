And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for determination of good faith settlement brought by Defendant Tobby Rolf Alvestad. The motion seeks to determine whether the settlement agreement between Alvestad and Plaintiff Hector Carbajal was made in good faith. The court has denied the motion without prejudice, meaning that the parties may still submit evidence and arguments to the court before the hearing date.

The court's ruling is based on its review of the settlement agreement and the parties' submissions. The court found that the settlement amount of $100,000, representing Alvestad's policy limit, may be reasonable given the disputed liability between the parties. However, the court also noted that Alvestad has not provided sufficient information about his potential liability and proportionate share of damages, nor has he calculated Plaintiff's approximate damages.

The court's decision is tentative and may be subject to change based on further submissions and arguments from the parties. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to attempt to resolve the dispute before the hearing date. If a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court indicating their intention and providing relevant contact information.
